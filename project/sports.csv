Rohit Sharma removed as India ODI captain, a glorious era comes to an end

Poll Do you think Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma should prioritize domestic cricket to stay in form for the 2027 World Cup? Yes, it's essential for their performance No, they can manage without it Maybe, but only if it fits their schedule Unsure about the impact

Legendary India cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has one piece of advice for Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to fulfill their dream of playing in the 2027 ODI World Cup, which will be held in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Namibia.The duo has been named in India's ODI squad for the three-match series in Australia. Virat Kohli and Rohit last played in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Virat won the IPL trophy for the first time on June 3, while Rohit's last competitive match for Mumbai Indians was on June 1.“They will have to play the Vijay Hazare Trophy in India whenever it’s scheduled, if it doesn’t clash with any international ODI tournaments. That’s one way to stay in trim and maintain match practice,"" Gavaskar told India Today.Rohit will be 40 and Kohli 37 when the 2027 World Cup comes around, and Gavaskar believes the veteran duo could find it difficult to remain in contention for selection unless they participate in domestic cricket.“It depends to a great extent on the number of one-day matches that India plays over the next couple of years,"" said Gavaskar.""Look, it’s not easy to be playing just seven or eight ODIs in a season while preparing for something as big as a World Cup.""For those eight white-ball matches, there are probably five T20s and three ODIs. That is not giving much in terms of exposure or practice for players who are approaching the latter stages of their careers,” he added.Gavaskar also took a sly dig at the duo's availability for the Australia tour.“I’m pretty certain that if this were a trip to Zimbabwe or the West Indies, both of them would not have been available.""But because this is in Australia, and because India lost to Australia in the World Cup final, maybe that is the reason why both of them have decided, yes, I want to be available for this,” he said.",Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have been named in India's ODI squad for the three- match series in Australia.

Poll Do you agree with Kramnik's assessment of Nakamura's gesture as damaging to chess? Yes, it's damaging. No, it's just a game.

Former world champion Vladimir Kramnik has made a scathing attack on world no. 2 Hikaru Nakamura after the American Grandmaster threw away 19-year-old world champion D Gukesh’s king in an exhibition event calledat Texas’ Esports Stadium Arlington.Hikaru Nakamura had stunned world champion D Gukesh as India were whitewashed 0-5 by USA in the first“This is not just vulgarity, but already a diagnosis of the degradation of modern chess,” Kramnik wrote on X.""I don’t know who came up with this childish, tasteless act. Likely this “thinker” had no specific intention to humiliate Gukesh, but could have realized that this public gesture (using opponent’s KING) looks offensive and provocative ESPECIALLY against the World Champion.""In another tweet, Kramnik said Nakamura's gesture has damaged the game.“There are players who show respect and mature gentlemanly behaviour, many prominent players in fact (Wesley So, Gukesh himself, and many others). Promoting for years the player known for his awful behaviour instead—deliberate action, damaging our game in my opinion,” he wrote.While the match had many tense moments and players from both teams created winning chances, USA rose to the occasion and scored several clutch wins.Playing with black pieces, the Indians suffered a rough loss and will look to bounce back with white pieces in the return match in the second leg in India.While Grandmaster Arjun Erigaisi lost to Fabiano Caruana, Grandmaster Divya Deshmukh suffered a shock defeat at the hands of International Master Carissa Yip.International Master Levy Rozman then defeated Sagar Shah before chess prodigy Ethan Vaz lost to International Master Tani Adewumi.",Former world champion Vladimir Kramnik has made a scathing attack on world no. 2 Hikaru Nakamura.

'Can't tell that on camera': Tilak Varma on heated moments during Asia Cup final vs Pakistan

Poll Do you believe that cricket should be separated from political tensions? Absolutely Not really

Former England captain Michael Atherton has called on the International Cricket Council (ICC) to increase transparency in its tournament draw system, suggesting a reduction in India-Pakistan matches. His comments follow the controversies during the 2025 Asia Cup The recent men's Asian tournament was marked by political undertones, influenced by the terror attack and border conflicts between the two nations. Both the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) were involved in these disputes.India and Pakistan have consistently been placed in the same group at ICC events for many years. The ICC's group selection process remains largely unexplained, unlike other major sporting tournaments.The cricket governing body reportedly ensures these teams share the same group to guarantee at least one India-Pakistan match per tournament. The Asia Cup takes this further, with its format designed to potentially create three such matches within a month, as seen in the latest edition.The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) relies heavily on the revenue from these matches to support grassroots cricket development in the region, making it a complex issue to address.""Despite its scarcity (maybe, in part, because of its scarcity) it is a fixture that carries huge economic clout, one of the main reasons why the broadcast rights for ICC tournaments are worth so much — roughly $3 billion for the most recent rights cycle (in) 2023-27,"" Atherton wrote in his column for The Times. ""Due to the relative decline in the value of bilateral matches, ICC events have grown in frequency and importance, and so the India and Pakistan fixture is crucial to the balance sheets of those who would not otherwise have any skin in the game. """"If cricket was once the vehicle for diplomacy, it is now, clearly, a proxy for broader tensions and for propaganda. There is little justification, in any case, for a serious sport to arrange tournament fixtures to suit its economic needs and now that the rivalry is being exploited in other ways, there is even less justification for it. For the next broadcast rights cycle, the fixture draw before ICC events should be transparent and if the two teams do not meet every time, so be it,"" Atherton added.These matches between India and Pakistan generate significant economic value, particularly for ICC tournaments. The broadcasting rights for these events command substantial fees, with the current cycle (2023-27) valued at approximately $3 billion.Recent events at the Asia Cup have highlighted the increasing intersection of cricket and geopolitics between these nations. The tournament saw multiple controversies and political statements from both sides.","Former England captain Michael Atherton has called on the International Cricket Council to increase transparency in its tournament draw system.

India secured a commanding 88-run victory over Pakistan in the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup 2025 at the R. Premadasa International Cricket Stadium in Colombo on Sunday.The win extended India's unbeaten record against Pakistan to 12-0 in ODIs under the leadership of Harmanpreet Kaur The match proceeded with expected patterns, though notably without the usual hostilities. India maintained their ""no-handshake"" policy at the toss and after the match, following the precedent from the men's Asia Cup in the UAE.The game featured some unexpected moments, including a toss mishap, an unusual run out, and a 15-minute delay due to bugs on the field.""Very happy, very important game for all of us, and I'm sure everyone back home is happy as well,"" Harmanpreet said at the post-match presentation.India batted first after being sent in and posted 247 runs before being dismissed. Harleen Deol contributed 46 runs while Richa Ghosh added a quick 35, though most batters struggled to convert their starts on the slow pitch.""It wasn't an easy pitch to bat on, we wanted to bat longer and see how many runs we can get. It wasn't an easy pitch. It's been raining, and there was a hold on the pitch. We wanted to keep wickets in hand.The key was keeping wickets, Richa batted really well and gave us that crucial 30 runs,"" Harmanpreet said.Pakistan's chase began poorly as they lost three early wickets, falling to 26 for 3 by the eighth over. They were eventually bowled out for 159 in 43 overs.Sidra Amin stood out for Pakistan with a fighting 81 runs off 106 balls, while Natalia Pervaiz contributed 33 runs.India's bowling attack proved effective with Kranti Goud taking 3/20 and Deepti Sharma claiming 3/45. Shree Charani also contributed with 2/38.""Our bowling was great. Kranti bowled really well, she was outstanding and Renuka helped her in getting the breakthroughs. We created so many chances, unfortunately, we dropped it, but in the end when you win you are happy,"" Harmanpreet said.""There are a lot of areas but we are happy we won, just want to go with the momentum.

Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has provided advice to Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma regarding their participation in the 2027 ODI World Cup. His suggestion follows chief selector Ajit Agarkar's announcement of Shubman Gill 's appointment as ODI captain, replacing Rohit Sharma.Both Kohli and Rohit have stepped away from T20Is in 2024 and Test cricket in early 2025. Currently, they only participate in bilateral ODIs, which have seen a reduction in frequency due to commercial factors, along with the IPL T20 tournament.""Rohit and Virat want to play the 2027 World Cup, but game fitness will be a big challenge for them. Rohit has worked well on his fitness. He is focused on that. But there is regular fitness, and game time fitness… If you are not playing regular cricket, both of them have to ensure some game time. They have to play domestic cricket,"" Pathan said on his YouTube channel.""They are big players and know what to do. They have all the experience in the world. But they are not even playing T20Is, so there will be big gaps between the few matches that they play before the big World Cup. They will need regular game time to be fit for that. Only then will their dream to play the 2027 World Cup come true.""The upcoming ODI tour of Australia will mark the beginning of Gill's captaincy.Following this, India's domestic season will commence in winter, featuring the Vijay Hazare Trophy, the country's premier List-A tournament. Neither Kohli nor Rohit has participated in this domestic competition for several years.""There is a leadership change; Gill will lead in both formats now. This is a big opportunity but a huge responsibility too. He has to take forward Virat's legacy in Test cricket and Rohit's legacy in white-ball cricket. This is a challenging but exciting phase for him as he is already batting well, he will need to keep that form going,"" he added.Shubman Gill's promotion comes at a significant time as he takes over the leadership role from one of India's most successful white-ball captains.

India captain Harmanpreet Kaur remained calm under pressure after a fiery moment with Pakistan’s Nashra Sandhu during the ICC Women’s World Cup clash at R. Premadasa Stadium on Sunday.Batting at No. 4, Harmanpreet scored 19 runs off 34 balls, including two boundaries, and shared a 39-run partnership for the third wicket with Harleen Deol. The tense exchange occurred in the 22nd over of India’s innings.One delivery earlier, Kaur had sent Sandhu down for a boundary. On the next ball, after playing a dot, Sandhu picked up the ball and made a mock throw in Kaur’s direction, accompanied by a fierce glare, seemingly attempting to unsettle the Indian skipper.Kaur, however, chose not to respond, keeping her focus firmly on her innings. Although she did mutter some words under her breath, it is unclear what was spoken.India’s innings struggled for momentum overall, with openers Smriti Mandhana (23) and Pratika Rawal (31) putting on 48 for the first wicket. After Kaur’s dismissal, Harleen Deol (46) and Jemimah Rodrigues (32) added 45 runs for the fourth wicket, helping India reach a competitive total of 247 in 50 overs.All-rounders Deepti Sharma (25) and Sneh Rana (20) contributed a 42-run stand for the sixth wicket, while Richa Ghosh’s quickfire 35 off 20 balls provided a late boost to the innings.In response, Pakistan struggled to chase the target, eventually being bowled out for 159 in 43 overs, handing India an 88-run victory. Sandhu, who had tried to intimidate Kaur, finished with just one wicket in her spell and conceded 52 runs in 10 overs.The match highlighted India’s dominance in a tense contest while also showcasing Kaur’s leadership and composure under pressure.India’s bowlers ensured that the visitors never got close to the target, with disciplined spells throughout the innings keeping Pakistan’s scoring in check.","Harmanpreet Kaur remained unfazed as Pakistan's Nashra Sandhu gave her a 'death stare' during the ICC Women's World Cup clash on Sunday.

Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan made an eye-catching post on his social media to celebrate India's victory over arch-rivals Pakistan in the Women's ODI World Cup on Sunday.“Just another Sunday of Eat. Sleep. Win. Repeat. Team India ,” wrote Pathan on X, capturing the mood of Indian fans after yet another convincing win over their noisy neighbours.For the fourth consecutive Sunday, India emerged victorious against their arch-rivals, three times in the Asia Cup (including a final) and now in the Women’s World Cup, continuing their dominance in cricket’s most emotionally charged rivalry.At Colombo’s R. Premadasa Stadium, India’s women secured a commanding 88-run win, but the match was overshadowed by tension that simmered both on and off the field.The traditional post-match handshake was notably absent, as players from both sides walked straight to their dressing rooms after the final ball.Even before play began, captains Harmanpreet Kaur and Fatima Sana skipped the customary handshake at the toss, a sign of the frosty relations between the two camps.Controversy erupted right from the toss when Sana’s call of “tails” was misheard as “heads,” mistakenly awarding Pakistan the toss.The confusion was only the start of a drama-filled day. Soon after, Pakistan opener Muneeba Ali was bizarrely run out after stepping out of her crease following an LBW review — her bat airborne when the bails were removed, leading to heated protests.Despite the tension, India stayed composed. Harleen Deol anchored the innings with a steady 46, while Richa Ghosh provided late fireworks, smashing 35 off 20 balls to lift India to 247. Pakistan’s Diana Baig bowled valiantly for her 4/69, but it wasn’t enough.In reply, Pakistan faltered early and never recovered. India’s spinners — Deepti Sharma and Sneh Rana — shared five wickets, and Kranti Goud’s fiery three-wicket burst sealed the deal.Only Sidra Amin’s graceful 81 offered resistance, but she lacked support as Pakistan crumbled.With this win, India climbed to the top of the table, while Pakistan remain winless — another Sunday, another Indian celebration.","India beat Pakistan by 88 runs in the Women's ODI World Cup in Sri Lanka.

Pakistan's fast bowler Diana Baig has confirmed that the confusion surrounding Muneeba Ali 's controversial run-out against India in Colombo has been resolved.The Women's World Cup match between India and Pakistan on Sunday was marked by controversy. The unusual incident occurred during Pakistan's chase of 248 runs.In the fourth over's final delivery, Indian players appealed for an lbw against Muneeba off Kranti Gaud's bowling, which the on-field umpire denied.Muneeba had secured her position by grounding her bat behind the crease. Deepti Sharma then threw the ball from slip, hitting the stumps. At that moment, Muneeba lifted her bat without any part of her body behind the crease.The third umpire's conflicting decisions displayed on the big screen created confusion among players and spectators. The initial verdict was not out, causing Indian players to return to their positions. The decision was then changed to out, surprising Muneeba and triggering celebrations among Indian players.""Muneeba's run-out issue has already been settled, I believe. I don't want to talk much about it now. Whatever happened and whatever the situation was, I think it has been resolved,"" Diana stated after Pakistan's 88-run loss.After being given out for 2 runs off 12 balls, Muneeba sought clarification from the on-field umpires. She paused while walking back after receiving instructions from the team dugout.Muneeba remained on the field while Pakistan captain Fatima Sana discussed the situation with fourth umpire Kim Cotton. The captain then signaled Muneeba to leave, ending the several-minute delay.The ICC Playing Condition 30.1.2 states: ""However, a batter shall not be considered to be out of his ground if, in running or diving towards his ground and beyond, and having grounded some part of his person or bat beyond the popping crease, there is subsequent loss of contact between the ground and any part of his person or bat, or between the bat and person.""This incident caused significant discussion during the match between the rival teams. The controversy added another chapter to the intense cricket rivalry between India and Pakistan.Muneeba's dismissal proved to be a crucial moment in the match.

Post-match reactions: Praise for Kranti, focus on momentum

NEW DELHI: The contrasting knocks of Harleen Deol and Richa Ghosh, backed by disciplined bowling, propelled India to a commanding 88-run victory over Pakistan in a drama-filled ICC Women’s World Cup clash in Colombo on Sunday. Sent in to bat on a slow track, India found stability in Deol’s composed 46 off 65 balls and the blitzkrieg of Richa Ghosh, whose 20-ball 35* at the death pushed India to a competitive 247 all out.Despite a series of early miscues, including a controversial toss in Pakistan’s favour and a 15-minute delay due to bugs invading the field, India’s bowlers dismantled Pakistan’s chase. Kranti Gaud (3/20) spearheaded the effort, tearing through the top order, while spinners Deepti Sharma (3/45) and Sneh Rana (2/38) cleaned up the middle and lower order. Sidra Amin’s valiant 81 off 106 balls and Natalia Pervaiz’s 33 offered resistance, but the rest of Pakistan’s lineup faltered.With this win, India extended their perfect ODI head-to-head record against Pakistan to 12-0.India’s batting stumbled on a sluggish surface early on, with opener Smriti Mandhana (23) falling inside the powerplay while Pratika Rawal (31) offered a brisk start. Harleen Deol’s steady 46 stitched together partnerships at crucial moments, including a 39-run stand with Harmanpreet Kaur (19) and 45 runs with Jemimah Rodrigues (32). Deol’s composed strokeplay anchored India through a tricky middle overs phase, providing the platform for Richa Ghosh to accelerate towards the end.Harmanpreet’s dismissal to an inside edge momentarily halted momentum, and Jemimah Rodrigues fell for 32 after an early reprieve on a no-ball. Nevertheless, the experienced pair of Deepti Sharma (25) and Sneh Rana (20) added a 42-run partnership, keeping India competitive before Richa Ghosh’s late flurry pushed the team to 247.Pakistan’s chase of 248 began in disarray when opener Muneeba Ali (2) was spectacularly run out by Deepti Sharma after momentarily wandering out of the crease. Kranti Gaud then struck twice in quick succession, removing Sadaf Shamas (6) caught and bowled, followed by Aliya Riaz (2), leaving Pakistan reeling at 26/3.The Indian bowling attack maintained relentless pressure, with Gaud exploiting the pitch’s pace and bounce, while Deepti Sharma and Shree Charani applied control with clever variations. The disciplined lines and lengths forced Pakistan to play under pressure, denying them rhythm or momentum in the chase.After early blows, Pakistan’s middle-order duo of Sidra Amin (81 off 106) and Natalia Pervaiz (33) attempted to stabilise the innings, adding a 69-run stand that briefly threatened to turn the tide. Amin played a composed knock, continuing her form from the recent South Africa series, finding boundaries at intervals and rotating strike well.However, once Gaud and the Indian bowlers broke the partnership, wickets fell at regular intervals. Deepti Sharma’s tight spell ensured Pakistan never recovered, and despite Sidra Amin’s lone fight, Pakistan were bowled out for 159 in 43 overs, sealing India’s comfortable 88-run victory.India captain Harmanpreet Kaur praised her bowlers and the late contributions with the bat: “Very happy, important win. Our bowling was great, Kranti was outstanding. Richa then gave us 30 crucial runs… we wanted to see how much we got on a slow, holding pitch. Right now, I’m happy we won.”Kranti Gaud, Player of the Match, said: “Feeling really good that I’m the Player of the Match in a World Cup match. People in my village would be proud.” Pakistan captain Fatima Sana acknowledged her team’s struggles despite Amin’s resistance, emphasizing the need for partnerships in future matches.India’s win highlighted a balanced performance of patience, aggression, and disciplined bowling, reinforcing their dominance over Pakistan in ODI cricket while keeping tournament momentum firmly in their favour.","India beat Pakistan by 88 runs in ICC Women's World Cup clash.

Poll Do you think India's women's cricket team will maintain their winning streak against Pakistan? Yes, they are too strong. No, Pakistan will catch up.

Former India cricketer and commentator Aakash Chopra took a sharp swipe at Pakistan while doing commentary, highlighting India Women’s dominance in the limited-overs format.“Here, you don’t need evidence to prove whether you win or lose, the proof is visible to everyone. And that proof is, India leads 11-0,” Chopra said, referencing India Women’s unbroken record against Pakistan in ODIs.His remark comes amid several disputed claims from Pakistan in the wake of heightened political tensions.Backing the team, India men’s captain Suryakumar Yadav also dismissed any notions of a rivalry between the women’s sides, expressing confidence in India extending their winning streak and making the record 12-0. “I’ll again say rivalry is when the competition is neck to neck. 11-0 is not a rivalry. If our women's team focuses on playing good cricket, it will be 12-0,” he said.On the field, India Women maintained control as Pakistan found it difficult to chase a modest target. At the end of 36 overs, Pakistan were 130 for five in their 50-over innings, needing 118 runs from 84 balls to reach India’s total.Muneeba Ali was the first wicket to fall, departing for 21, while Sadaf Shamas (6) and Aliya Riaz (28) also fell cheaply.Sidra Amin, however, was steady with 66 runs off 49 balls, striking at 170.21, while Natalia Pervaiz contributed 33. Fatima Sana, the Pakistan captain, could only manage 21 before being caught by Smriti Mandhana off Deepti Sharma. Sidra Nawaz remained unbeaten on 11.India’s bowlers were clinical, with Kranti Gaud taking three wickets for 12 overs and Deepti Sharma claiming two, keeping Pakistan under pressure throughout.Eventually, India secured an 88-run victory, ensuring that they not only extend India’s dominance over Pakistan to 12 consecutive ODI victories but also reinforced the growing gap between the two sides in the women’s game. The victory in Colombo also saw India rise to the top of the standings over Australia, with four points from 2 games.","Former India cricketer and commentator Aakash Chopra took a sharp swipe at Pakistan while doing commentary.

Poll Will Pakistan secure their first-ever ODI win against India today? Yes No, India will continue to dominate

In a landmark moment for Pakistan in the ICC Women’s World Cup, opener Sidra Amin scripted history by hitting her team’s first-ever six against India in ODIs. The milestone came in the 18th over of Pakistan’s chase at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.Facing off-spinner Sneh Rana, Sidra stepped down the track and confidently hit her over long-on. The ball cleared the ropes by a few feet, marking a rare moment in what has been a one-sided rivalry between the two sides.Sidra’s six briefly lifted the tempo of Pakistan’s innings, which had earlier struggled to build momentum after early dismissals.By the end of 24 overs, Pakistan had reached 81 for 3, still needing 167 runs for victory. Sidra remained unbeaten on 37 off 66 balls, having struck four boundaries and that historic six. Partnering her was Natalia Pervaiz on 27, as the duo steadied Pakistan’s innings after a rocky start.Earlier in the day, India posted 247 before being bowled out in 50 overs. Jemimah Rodrigues (32 off 37) and Richa Ghosh (35* off 20) were among the power hitters, while Diana Baig (4/69) and Fatima Sana (2/38) led Pakistan’s bowling attack. Pakistan’s chase began poorly with Muneeba Ali’s controversial run-out in the fourth over, followed by Sadaf Shamas and Aliya Riaz’s quick dismissals. But Sidra’s hitting, capped by her historic six provided a rare highlight for Pakistan in the high-stakes encounter.It remains to be seen whether Pakistan will claw their way to a first-ever win over India in ODIs, and open their account in what has been a one-sided rivalry so far.",Sidra Amin became the fist ever to hit a six against India in ODIs.

'Practically impossible to have three captains': Ajit Agarkar explains why Shubman Gill succeeded Rohit Sharma as ODI skipper

Poll How do you view Shubman Gill's appointment as ODI captain? It's a good move for the future. Too soon; he should wait his turn.

Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif has come down heavily on the Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee after the decision to replace Rohit Sharma as India’s ODI captain.The move was confirmed by Agarkar during a press conference ahead of India’s white-ball tour of Australia, with 26-year-old Shubman Gill named as Rohit’s successor.Kaif took to social media to express his disappointment, questioning why the selectors could not have allowed Rohit to continue until the 2027 ODI World Cup. He reminded that under Rohit’s leadership, India had an exceptional record in ICC tournaments.“Rohit Sharma gave 16 years to Indian cricket, aur usko ek saal nehi de paye? (Couldn't give him juse one whole year?) Out of 16 ICC events, India won 15 matches and lost only one: the 2023 ODI World Cup final against Australia,” Kaif said.He also pointed out that Rohit led India to major triumphs, including the 2024 T20 World Cup and the Champions Trophy earlier this year. “He also helped India win the Champions Trophy in Dubai. Under his leadership, India lifted trophies, including the 2024 World Cup,” Kaif added.Rohit, who recently retired from Test cricket, was also the Player of the Match in the Champions Trophy final against New Zealand, marking a second successive ICC title under his captaincy.Kaif further stated that Rohit showed maturity and selflessness by stepping away at the right time, unlike several players who extend their careers. “Rohit demonstrated character by retiring at the right time and stepping away from the spotlight to let new players take the lead. He guided, taught and supported young players under pressure. But, despite his success, he was not allowed to captain for the 2027 World Cup,” he said.The former India batter called the move premature, suggesting that Gill’s elevation could have waited. “Shubman Gill takes over as captain. He’s young and promising. But, what was the need to rush it? What was the need to go overboard? His time will come. But, it was still Rohit Sharma’s time,” Kaif concluded.Gill's first assignment as ODI captain will come on October 19, when India take on Australia in the first match of the three-game series.","Shubman Gill has been named as India's new ODI captain.

Poll Do you think the umpire made the right call in Muneeba Ali's dismissal? Yes, it was justified No, it was a controversial decision

A moment of utter confusion marked the early stages of Pakistan’s innings against India in the ICC Women’s World Cup 2025 on Sunday, when opener Muneeba Ali was dismissed in controversial fashion off the final delivery of the fourth over.The incident began when Kranti Gaud bowled one that trapped Muneeba in front of middle and leg. India went up in a loud appeal for LBW, but wicketkeeper Richa Ghosh didn’t appear convinced, and captain Harmanpreet Kaur chose not to review.As the players discussed the appeal, Deepti Sharma produced a sharp direct hit at the striker’s end, catching Muneeba unaware outside her crease.Initially, the big screen showed “NOT OUT” after the third umpire’s first review, as Muneeba seemed to have dragged her bat back inside the line.But in a dramatic twist, the officials decided to take another look, this time checking if the bat was grounded when the ball hit the stumps.Replays revealed that her bat was in the air at that exact moment, leading to a reversal of the decision.The run-out stood, leaving Muneeba dismissed for 2 off 12 balls.The sequence caused visible confusion. Muneeba stood near the boundary line for a while, seemingly unconvinced by the call.Skipper Fatima Sana was also seen speaking to a match official to clarify the decision, while the match briefly halted amid tense discussions.Adding to the delay, Pakistan’s next batter, Sidra Amin, waited near the ropes before being prompted by the officials to make her way to the crease. The moment summed up a chaotic passage of play that saw emotions run high on both sides.According to Law 30 of the playing conditions, a batter is deemed out of her ground unless some part of her person or bat is grounded behind the popping crease. However, if a batter has already made her ground while running or diving and then momentarily loses contact, she is still considered safe. In Muneeba’s case, since she was stationary and not running or diving, her lifted bat meant she was technically out of her ground, and therefore rightly given out under the laws.It was an unfortunate end for Muneeba, who appeared to have made her ground before her bat lifted at the last instant.At the six-over mark, Pakistan were 18 for 1, needing 230 more runs to win. Sadaf Shamas (5*) and Sidra Amin (8*) were at the crease, with Renuka Singh Thakur keeping things tight in her opening spell.The rare double-check decision and its aftermath left the crowd and players visibly confused momentarily - a reminder of how the finest of margins can influence games.","Muneeba Ali was initially adjudged not out, but was then given out after an umpire review.

The ICC Women’s World Cup clash between India and Pakistan in Colombo on Sunday produced not only tense cricket but also a comical moment in the field that had fans and commentators talking.During the 50th over, India’s Richa Ghosh attempted a pull shot off a short delivery from Diana Baig. The top-edge went straight into the air, offering an easy catch opportunity between the wicketkeeper and backward point. However, both fielders collided trying to take it, and the ball was dropped. Thankfully, neither player was injured in the process.Kranti Gaud capitalised on the same, hitting a boundary on the next ball before miscuing an attempted drive on the following delivery. She was caught by Aliya Riaz at mid-off for 8 runs off 4 balls. The sequence continued to add to the drama, with Renuka Singh Thakur coming to the crease and being dismissed off the very next delivery, also caught, this time by Sidra Nawaz off Diana Baig.Despite the hiccup, India posted a competitive total of 247 all out in 50 overs on a pitch that offered some moisture, slowing the ball down and giving bowlers some control.Key contributors included Harleen Deol (46), Jemimah Rodrigues (32), Deepti Sharma (25), and Richa Ghosh, who remained unbeaten on 35.Wickets fell steadily throughout India's innings, and Pakistan bowlers made sure to keeping India in check despite the brief comedic error.The dropped catch, coming so late in the innings, became a talking point on social media as well.India will now look to regroup as Pakistan aim to chase the total.

MADRID: Vinicius Junior fired Real Madrid to the top of La Liga with a brace in a 3-1 win over Villarreal on Saturday, while Kylian Mbappe was also on target.Los Blancos moved two points clear of champions Barcelona, who visit Sevilla on Sunday, as they bounced back from last week's derby drubbing.Having returned from their long midweek trip to Kazakhstan, where they beat Kairat in the Champions League , Madrid turned their focus back to domestic matters.Thrashed 5-2 by city rivals Atletico Madrid last weekend, Xabi Alonso's side had plenty to prove against a strong Villarreal team, who are third.""I played very well and I want to continue like this, keeping this confidence and doing even more,"" Vinicius told Real Madrid TV.""We have good feelings... when we come back (from the international break) we have big games and we need confidence,"" added Vinicius.The winger did not start the season well but has found form in recent outings.""Vini had a very good game and he was decisive, I'm very happy for him,"" Alonso told reporters.Alonso brought Fede Valverde back into the team, playing him at right-back in the absence of injured duo Dani Carvajal and Trent Alexander-Arnold.Madrid had the better of a slow-paced first half at the Santiago Bernabeu.Teenage attacker Franco Mastantuono might have sent Los Blancos ahead but Villarreal defender Renato Veiga blocked his shot after Mbappe cut the ball back to him.At the other end, Thibaut Courtois saved superbly from Tani Oluwaseyi, who snuck in behind the centre-backs but could not beat Madrid's Belgian goalkeeper.Los Blancos took the lead early in the second half through Vinicius, whose shot took a fortunate deflection off Santi Comesana and flew past the helpless Arnau Tenas.Xabi Alonso brought on Jude Bellingham for the final 25 minutes, after benching him for the second game running following the Atletico debacle.Thomas Tuchel left the midfielder out of his England squad for upcoming World Cup qualifiers this week, and he was out to prove a point.Madrid doubled their lead when Rafa Marin brought down Vinicius in the area and the Brazilian beat Tenas from the spot. The former Barcelona goalkeeper could have stopped the penalty but the ball slipped under him.Alonso said that Mbappe is Madrid's main penalty taker but ""it was their decision"" to give Vinicius the ball.Vinicius wanted another penalty when Tenas appeared to bring him down in the box moments later, but his appeals were waved away.Bellingham twice came close but Tenas denied him on both occasions, with the midfielder kicking a post in frustration.Villarreal pulled a goal back through Georges Mikautadze, who finished lethally from the edge of the box, but Madrid quickly restored their two-goal cushion.Yellow Submarine defender Santiago Mourino was sent off for a second yellow card for a push on Vinicius as he charged down the wing, and soon Mbappe netted the third.Brahim Diaz teed up the French superstar to roll home his ninth league goal of the campaign, making him the division's top scorer.Mbappe was taken off grimacing in the final stages, in the only negative note for a Madrid side who were good value for their three points.""Kylian already had a little discomfort in his ankle, we will see how it goes,"" said Alonso, adding that the forward would still travel to join up with the French national team.Villarreal's Comesana complained about some of the refereeing decisions that went against his side.""It's a shame about the first goal which hit me, and then came the penalty, which wasn't enough (of a foul) to give it,"" Comesana told DAZN.""That hurt us a lot, you only have to look how he threw himself down... and the red card (was soft)... if it's already hard to win at the Bernabeu, with these things it's even harder.""","Real Madrid beat Villarreal 3-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu. Vinicius Junior scores a brace and Kylian Mbappe also on target. Los Blancos move two points clear of Barcelona, who visit Sevilla on Sunday.

Poll Was Manchester United's win over Sunderland a turning point for their season? Yes, they'll improve No, still skeptical

Arsenal moved to the top of the Premier League table as Declan Rice came back to haunt his former club West Ham, while Manchester United gave manager Ruben Amorim some breathing space with a convincing 2-0 victory over Sunderland on Saturday.In Mikel Arteta ’s 300th match in charge, the Gunners proved too strong for West Ham at the Emirates Stadium, securing a 2-0 win that strengthened their bid for a first Premier League title in 22 years. Victory, however, came at a cost as captain Martin Odegaard was forced off injured before half-time for the third time this season. Arsenal’s squad depth, though, made light of the setback.“We dominated and fully deserved to win this,” Arteta said. “To go top of the table after some big fixtures over the last week and some injuries… we were able to respond.”Rice, who left West Ham in 2023 for a club-record £105 million ($141 million), ended the visitors’ resistance by blasting home on the rebound after Alphonse Areola parried Eberechi Eze’s shot. Bukayo Saka made the points safe from the penalty spot midway through the second half, marking his 200th Arsenal appearance after Jurrien Timber was brought down by El Hadji Malick Diouf.Arsenal now sit a point clear of Liverpool, who face Chelsea later. West Ham remain in the relegation zone.Meanwhile, Ruben Amorim breathed a sigh of relief as Manchester United eased pressure with a 2-0 win over Sunderland at Old Trafford. Mason Mount opened the scoring after eight minutes from Bryan Mbeumo’s cross, while Benjamin Sesko doubled the lead with a predatory finish from a long throw-in. Debutant goalkeeper Senne Lammens kept a clean sheet, and VAR overturned a late Sunderland penalty after insufficient contact by Sesko.Amorim said, “We were a competitive and adult team today. We need to do this kind of performance away as well — it’s our responsibility to play like this.”Tottenham also impressed with a 2-1 win over Leeds, ending their year-long unbeaten league run. Mohammed Kudus scored his first goal for Spurs after Mathys Tel had put the visitors ahead, with Noah Okafor briefly equalising.Liverpool can reclaim the top spot if they beat Chelsea later.",Arsenal beat West Ham 2-0 in Mikel Arteta's 300th match in charge.

Poll Do you agree with Tuchel's decision to leave Bellingham out of the squad for upcoming matches? Yes, it’s the right choice. No, he should be included.

England manager Thomas Tuchel has explained that Jude Bellingham’s absence from the squad for upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia is due to the midfielder’s “lack of rhythm” and not any personal issues.Bellingham, 22, missed England’s September victories over Andorra and Serbia following shoulder surgery and has since featured in only four matches for Real Madrid, starting just once.“He’s a very special player and for special players there can be special rules, I get this,” Tuchel said, referring to Bellingham, who was named England men’s player of the year for 2024/25 at the start of the month. “But for this camp we decided that we stick with our straightforward decision to invite the same team. That applies also for Jude, he deserves always to be in camp.”Tuchel added that Bellingham had been eager to play. “He wanted to be called up, we had a phone call, there was no issue from that side,” he said.The manager also addressed concerns about any friction with other notable absentees, Jack Grealish and Phil Foden, stressing: “No, there is also no problem between me and Phil Foden, there is also no problem with Jack Grealish.Very special players. There is no problem at all, there is no personal problem.”Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka returns to the squad after missing September’s internationals with a hamstring issue, while Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, and Tino Livramento are ruled out through injury.England currently sit atop their World Cup qualifying group, having beaten Andorra 2-0 and Serbia 5-0 last month to record five wins from five matches. Tuchel emphasised the decision to maintain continuity in the squad, saying, “We decided to invite the same group of players to make more stable what we built on. Keep on pushing.”The upcoming double-header sees England face Wales at Wembley next Thursday, followed by a World Cup qualifier against Latvia in Riga five days later.",Jude Bellingham has been left out of England's squad for upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia.

A new chapter in football history is unfolding as Luca Zidane, son of French legend Zinedine Zidane , received his first call-up to the Algerian national team on Thursday. The 27-year-old goalkeeper, who previously represented France at youth levels, is now eligible to play for Algeria through his father’s family heritage, marking a significant “change of an era” in the Zidane legacy.FIFA officially approved Zidane’s switch in national allegiance just two weeks ago, clearing the way for him to represent the North African nation. Currently playing for Spanish second-division side Granada, Luca’s call-up comes at a critical juncture, with Algeria on the cusp of qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America.Algeria coach Vladimir Petkovic included Zidane in his 26-player squad for upcoming qualifying fixtures against Somalia on October 9 and Uganda on October 14. The Desert Foxes lead their group by four points, and a victory in either match would secure their spot in the tournament co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico.The Zidane name is already etched in World Cup history. Zinedine Zidane played in three editions for France, lifting the trophy in 1998 and experiencing heartbreak in 2006 after his infamous headbutt in the final against Italy. Now, Luca has the opportunity to make his mark on the international stage and continue his father’s storied legacy — this time with Algeria.With the 2026 World Cup approaching, Luca Zidane’s debut signals not just a personal milestone but a symbolic shift in football heritage.",Luca Zidane received his first call-up to the Algerian national team on Thursday.

As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins. He was pushed from second place to third, with Cassidy in second. Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings. He won two podium spots this season.","All three Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate.

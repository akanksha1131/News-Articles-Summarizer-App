Poll Which moment from Bumrah's career at Lord's do you believe is the most memorable? His first five-wicket haul at Lord's The 89-run partnership with Shami

Indian pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah brought humor to a press conference at Lord's Cricket Ground after the second day's play in the third Test against England, where he achieved figures of 5/74. During the conference, when discussing his memorable moments and handling judgment, a reporter's wife called, prompting Bumrah to joke about not answering the call.Bumrah led India's pace attack in London's heat, claiming crucial wickets of Harry Brook, Joe Root , and Ben Stokes , restricting England to 387 runs. His performance earned him a spot on the prestigious Lord's honours board.During the press interaction, when a phone rang, Bumrah lightheartedly remarked, ""Somebody's wife is calling. But I will not pick it up.""Reflecting on his most cherished cricket memories, Bumrah recalled the 2021 Lord's Test against England. Despite going wicketless and scoring a duck in the first innings, he formed an unbeaten 89-run partnership with Mohammed Shami in the second innings, scoring 34 runs while Shami made 56, leading to India's 151-run victory.""I don't think about all that. The most memorable test match for me was in England last time. When Shami Bhai and I won the match with batting, so obviously, I will remember those memories. It is a good thing to come to the Honours Board. When my son grows up, I can tell him that my name is on the Honours Board,"" Bumrah shared.He continued, ""And it is also there in many other places. But I remember the memories. In that match, I took only 3 or 4 wickets.But that memory was very special for me because we came forward in the game from behind, and we had them all out in 60 overs. So memories are very important to me.""The 31-year-old pacer returned to action after resting during the second Test as part of workload management. Despite speculation about his participation, he silenced critics with his first five-wicket haul at Lord's.Addressing the constant scrutiny that comes with playing for the national team, Bumrah expressed his perspective on handling judgment and criticism.""Obviously, when I play for India, I want to contribute as much as I can, and when you can do it, you feel good that you have put the team in a good position. So my thought process remains the same. As long as I wear this jersey, there will be judgments because every cricketer goes through that. As long as I am playing on TV, there will be judgments,"" he stated.He added, ""And obviously, that is how a part and parcel of professional sport is. You will always be judged by your performances, and obviously, you will always be judged day in and day out. Even when Sachin sir played 200 test matches, he was still judged. I have just left it that way. So everybody judges. And I forgot the question. But yes, that's how it is.""",Jasprit Bumrah took 5/74 in the third Test against England at Lord's.

He scored 1,442 runs with four centuries at an average of 36.97. His career with Australia ended due to tough competition and drops in form.The loss of his brother Dominic in Brisbane in 2024 changed everything for Burns.

Poll Should there be a penalty for teams that waste time requesting ball changes? Yes, a five-run penalty makes sense No, it's part of the game Only if the requests are excessive

NEW DELHI: Apart from Jasprit Bumrah’s fiery spell, Joe Root’s century, and Brydon Carse’s gritty fightback, Day 2 of the third Test at Lord’s had an unusual recurring subplot — Team India’s repeated attempts to get the ball changed. Shubman Gill , clearly annoyed, was seen multiple times approaching the umpires, pointing at the ball and urging them to inspect it.This led to a repeated process: the umpires passing the ball through the ring gauge, sometimes approving a change, sometimes not. This routine unfolded several times during the first session alone, raising questions about the persistent shape issues with the Dukes ball.These actions didn’t go unnoticed, especially by former England players and sections of the English media, who openly criticised India’s conduct.Former England fast bowler Stuart Broad didn’t mince words on social media:“The cricket ball should be like a fine wicketkeeper — barely noticed. We are having to talk about the ball too much because it is such an issue & being changed virtually every innings. Unacceptable… Dukes have a problem. They need to fix it. A ball should last 80 overs. Not 10.”Chief Cricket Writer for The Telegraph, Scyld Berry, also took a dig at the Indian team and even suggested a penalty for time-wasting:""The on-field umpires, every 10 overs, put the ball through the gauge – and if it does not go through, then they change it if either side wants.The fielding side can ask for the ball to be gauged at any time – and the present crop do seem to be losing shape and going soft too soon – but if the ball goes through the umpire’s gauge, and therefore there is nothing wrong with it, they should be given a five-run penalty for time-wasting. ""Former England captain Nasser Hussain, speaking on Sky Sports, said the issue runs deeper:""The first thing is that there's a serious issue with the Dukes ball,"" Hussain said.""Both captains talked about it before the game. We've seen it in this game: in this session, it's been changed twice. We've seen it in the last few years, really, the Dukes ball going out of shape.""The second point at play here is that I think the ball is changed too often. I think we're getting a bit precious about cricket balls. In the history of the game, the cricket ball gets old, and the cricket ball gets soft. I think we're getting a bit addicted to having the perfect cricket ball for 80 overs.""The third thing at play is that they got through in that first hour and Bumrah was unplayable … I looked up from my laptop at the back of comms box and went, 'They're changing the ball: why would you change the ball that is doing something to a random box of balls?' You know nothing about that, you know everything about this … I get why they're getting upset - it did look older, it did look softer -- but why change? Why take the gamble? I thought that was a real bizarre thing to do when you've got something, especially in this time when the Dukes ball is so all over the place, when you've got something, stick to it. They didn't.""","Team India repeatedly tried to get the ball changed on Day 2 of the third Test at Lord's.

Poll Should Nathan Lyon be included in the final XI for the third Test against the West Indies? Yes, he should play No, he should be left out

Australia's cricket team is considering leaving out veteran spinner Nathan Lyon for the third Test against the West Indies in Jamaica, marking a potential strategic shift in their lineup. Captain Pat Cummins has delayed naming the final XI, departing from the approach taken in the first two Tests, as the team contemplates fielding a four-seamer attack or restructuring the team with an additional batter for their first day-night Test match outside Australian shores.The decision regarding Lyon, who holds 562 Test wickets and ranks second on Australia's all-time Test wicket-takers list, remains uncertain just before the match. The 37-year-old spinner has only missed three Tests since 2013, all during the 2023 Ashes tour due to a calf injury.""Everything's an option,"" Cummins said when asked about the possibility of dropping Lyon. ""We honestly haven't settled on it. We all left yesterday and thought we'd just sleep on it, come back and have a look and make up our mind today.""Australia's consideration of leaving out Lyon comes despite his strong performance in the ongoing series, where he has claimed nine wickets at an average of 18.33, placing him second on Australia's wicket-takers list behind Josh Hazlewood Lyon's bowling workload has been notably light during the series, delivering just 32.3 overs, the lowest among specialist bowlers from both teams who have played both Tests. His economy rate of 5.07 reflects his primary role of bowling to the West Indies tail-enders.The pink ball factor is playing a significant role in the team's selection deliberations, as confirmed by Cummins. Australia maintains an impressive 13-0 record in day-night Tests, with Lyon personally claiming 43 wickets at an average of 25.62 in these matches.The pitch at Sabina Park appears distinctly green a day before the Test, potentially influencing the selection decision. The team might recall Josh Inglis to strengthen their batting lineup, with Beau Webster's medium-pace serving as the fourth bowling option alongside Travis Head's off-breaks.Cameron Green remains unavailable for bowling duties as he continues recovering from a back injury that kept him sidelined during the Australian summer.If the team opts for a bowling replacement, Scott Boland, who hasn't played since his performance against India, stands as the primary candidate. Sean Abbott could also potentially make his Test debut.The selection decision represents a potential shift in Australia's usual Test match strategy, as they haven't fielded four specialist pace bowlers in a match since facing India in Perth in January 2012.This strategic consideration comes as Australia leads the series, having won both previous Tests against the West Indies, and looks to maintain their perfect record in day-night Test matches.","Australia's cricket team is considering leaving out veteran spinner Nathan Lyon for the third Test against the West Indies in Jamaica.

Poll Should players be allowed to check the ball as often as they want? Yes, it's part of the game. No, it disrupts the flow of the game.

Yuvraj Singh hits out at media at YWC Gala, lauds Shubman Gill's sublime form

The Dukes ball has come under heavy scrutiny from players and media alike throughout the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy. The debate resurfaced during the third Test at Lord’s when Shubman Gill was repeatedly seen approaching the umpire to have the ball checked. The umpires were frequently seen putting the ball through the gauge—sometimes it was rejected, sometimes replaced. This process played out several times during the first session, largely due to the ball losing its shape.In fact, on Day 2 morning alone, the Dukes ball was changed twice. After a 10-over-old ball was replaced, the Indian players still expressed their dissatisfaction, prompting another change within minutes.Even before the Lord’s Test, captain Shubman Gill and wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant had voiced their concerns about the Dukes ball going soft and losing shape far too often.Amidst the controversy, England’s Joe Root appeared to take a subtle jab at India, saying that teams must learn to adapt to the challenge.""The summer has been hot, the squares are harder. No two balls are the same. You’ve got to adapt and take it as a challenge, not keep asking for a change,"" Root said after the day's play.Root, who followed up his century with a record-setting catch, played a key role alongside Jofra Archer—who made a successful return with a wicket—as England dominated Day 2.England posted 387 in their first innings, and in reply, India reached 145 for 3 at stumps, trailing by 242 runs.""I think it’s a good score. It’s already hot, dry, and very slow. We have crucial runs on the board. There’s always something to work with here… even if the ball goes soft,"" Root added.","Dukes ball has come under heavy scrutiny from players and media alike.

NEW DELHI: England’s Jamie Smith etched his name into the record books on Day 2 of the Lord’s Test against India, matching Quinton de Kock’s record for the fastest 1,000 runs in Test cricket by a wicketkeeper. Smith reached the milestone in just 21 innings — the same number it took the South African star — since making his debut in July last year.Needing just three runs to achieve the landmark, Smith got there with a boundary off Mohammed Siraj in the 87th over of England’s first innings, shortly after Ben Stokes was bowled by Jasprit Bumrah for 44.Smith has been in impressive form. At Edgbaston, in the previous Test, he walked in at a precarious 84/5 and smashed a 100 off just 80 balls — the joint-third fastest Test century for England. His unbeaten 184 off 207 deliveries in that match became the highest Test score by an English wicketkeeper, surpassing Alec Stewart’s 173* against New Zealand in 1997.In the second innings at Edgbaston, while England collapsed chasing 608, Smith fought a lone battle with a gritty 88 off 99 balls in their 336-run loss.With this feat, Smith joins an elite group of wicketkeeper-batters.

Poll Which team's qualification for the 2026 T20 World Cup surprised you the most? Netherlands Italy

The final day of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup Europe Qualifiers was full of drama, with all four teams still in the race to qualify. In the end, both Netherlands and Italy booked their tickets for the 2026 T20 World Cup, which will be held in India and Sri Lanka.This marks a historic moment for Italy, who have qualified for the T20 World Cup for the first time ever.Despite losing to the Netherlands, Italy managed to go through on net run rate. After scoring 134/7, Italy needed to make sure the Netherlands didn’t chase the target too quickly, in order to maintain the required NRR. Even though the Dutch got off to a fast start thanks to Michael Levitt and Max O'Dowd, Italy managed to stretch the game to the 17th over—just enough to seal their spot.Earlier, Netherlands restricted Italy well with the ball. Roelof van der Merwe was the pick of the bowlers, taking 3 wickets for just 15 runs in 4 overs. Kyle Klein also kept things tight for his side.Italy struggled to build big partnerships and kept losing wickets. However, a steady knock from Benjamin Manenti and a quick finish by Grant Stewart helped them reach 134/7.Netherlands chased the target with ease, but Italy also secured a historic win in the process.Meanwhile, Jersey missed out on qualification despite beating Scotland for the first time. On the final day, the equations for qualify were that both Jersey and Italy would qualify if both teams won. However, if Jersey and the Netherlands won, only one from Italy and Jersey would qualify on the basis of net run rate, along with the Dutch.Following the results, ICC chairman Jay Shah took to X, as he penned congratulatory messages for the sides that qualified. In an X post, he wrote, ""An amazing result for @KNCBcricket and @FedCricket, qualifying for the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026 through the Europe Qualifier.

Poll What impressed you more about Bumrah’s performance at Lord’s? His fifer in tough conditions His humility despite the milestone

India head coach Gautam Gambhir's animated chat with Yashasvi Jaiswal | Exclusive India nets

A warm hug later, Mohammed Siraj urged Jasprit Bumrah to raise the ball and acknowledge the crowd after completing his fifer. Bumrah seemed reluctant and Siraj had to literally handhold the gesture as his teammate seemed reluctant. It was only the ninth England wicket down and for Bumrah the job was still not done as there was another batter left to be dismissed before the celebrations could take over.The celebrations of getting his name on the Lord's Honours Board - something many legends of the sport haven't achieved. The moment came after he disturbed Jofra Archer's woodwork but it earned no more than a gentle raise of the index finger. The middle-stump went for a walk and the 31-year-old joined the elite list of India bowlers who are mentioned on the Honours Boards at the iconic Lord's cricket ground.The commentators kept mentioning how ""Bumrah wanted to play at Lord's, wanted to be on the Honours Boards"" and here he was, leading the side off the park when the final wicket fell and took the memorable walk from the long room to the changing room. It's an overwhelming moment for any professional cricketer to walk through that room after a milestone and it was visible on Bumrah's face.Bumrah arrived in England well aware that he would be playing three Tests and to pick fifers in two out of his three outings is a very special achievement by a bowler who keeps raising the bar.Conditions, weather, pitch and shape of the ball have hardly mattered to him as when the skill takes over, batters around the world look ordinary. Lord's was no different.It was hot, the sun was harsh, there was hardly any wind to be used but Bumrah still had the ingredients to dish out another bowling masterclass. With nothing happening in the air and off the surface, Bumrah worked the angles, used the width of the crease and stuck to attacking the stumps.India's bowling coach Morne Morkel had emphasised earlier in the series on how it was important to keep the stumps in play in this part of the world, and Bumrah was relentless with his lines.Ball after ball, he kept making the batters play, induced plenty of false shots but was unlucky to pick just one wicket on the opening day. He wasn't going to depend on luck on the second day as he made the second new ball talk and picked four wickets to complete the famous fifer at the Home of Cricket.Ben Stokes was undone by a peach. Joe Root fell to his nemesis for the 11th time in the format. Some DRS drama led to a golden duck for Chris Woakes. And, in the end, Archer had no answers to the one which just came in with the angle and did enough to beat the tail-ender's hang of the bat.The wickets were hard work and he had to bowl as many as 27 overs in conditions which were anything but pleasant. The cold towel around his neck during the first drinks break on Day 2 was evidence of how uncomfortable the players were getting as the mercury kept rising. The locals have already termed it a serious heatwave and they expect harsher conditions in the coming week.As far as the third Test is concerned, Bumrah made it another harsh assignment for England batters and served a reminder that no matter how hard you prepare, he will continue to find a way.",Jasprit Bumrah took four wickets on the second day of the third Test.

A recherché region in India — where cricket has failed to stamp its authority, where it’s commonplace to find a Barcelona or Arsenal motif than one endorsing one of our cricketing stars and where people disregard altitude hindrances to spend the increasingly climate change-affected summers to indulge in the game of football — has finally found its representation on the national stage.The 134th edition of Durand Cup will see participation from the first club from the Himalayan region of Ladakh in 1 Ladakh FC.""It’s a massive opportunity, not just for 1 Ladakh FC but also for the UT of Ladakh to be playing at Durand Cup for the first time ever. A huge thanks to the organisers,"" 1 Ladakh FC co-founder and general secretary of Ladakh Football Association (LFA), Tsering Angmo, told TOI.""We are the team from topmost part of India and Durand Cup is an opportunity for us to bring Ladakh on the Indian football map and use this opportunity to spread the message of awareness on climate change.""""And you will see we will be very unique in how we play football and carry our message to the people of the country,"" she added.Its uniqueness, in fact, is what has made this club – a brainchild of Tsering and former Real Kashmir co-owner Shamim Meraj — a pop-culture phenomenon abroad intertwining Ladakh’s culture, the black-necked crane on the crest, traditional motifs on the jerseys, and Buddhist principles of compassion, with bold social action.Their eco-friendly jerseys, unveiled by the Dalai Lama, have already sold in thousands outside India, especially in Europe.But the opportunity to bring their football from an altitude of 11,500ft-high to the mainland national stage is one that the two-year-old club has cherished since its inception.""Our expectations are very grounded. We like to dream, too, but for now we just want to compete well and give a good show at Durand Cup and then hope for some magic and miracles!"" was how Tsering explained their upcoming sojourn.However, 1 Ladakh FC are not leaving stones unturned in their endeavour to compete with some of the best clubs in the country. The dearth of professionals from the region has led them to recruit 10 footballers from around the country to guide their challenge, along with the Ladakhi players.Former Chennaiyin FC assistant coach, Rajan Mani, will be at the helm of the club with his experience in youth setup, having been a youth coach at Bengaluru FC as well as the ex-head of youth development with the U16 Indian team.""Playing on the mainland, with the huge difference in weather conditions from Ladakh, can be a deterrent to the players’ performance. So, we are taking steps to nullify those effects,"" Tsering explained.Hence, the team will be travelling to Delhi on Friday and undergo a 10-day conditioning camp at IMT Ghaziabad. They will then avoid unnecessary air travel emissions and travel by train to Jamshedpur, the destination of their Group C clashes, and hold a five-day camp in collaboration with Jamshedpur FC , ahead of their Durand Cup opener against Foreign Services Team at JRD Tata Sports Complex on Aug 2.But the very existence of the club, touted ""the greenest club in South Asia"" with its mission to hit net-zero carbon in four years, challenges the status quo. Apart from their goal of eventually playing in the I-League and becoming the first club from Ladakh in India’s top-tiers, it’s their environmental message that makes them the club to watch out for at Durand Cup.""It’s the perfect opportunity for us to amplify our message, and some plans are being worked out on that,"" Tsering agreed.""We will be the team using minimum plastic and have a carbon footprint calculator to measure our carbon footprint. Then we will offset that with measures both back home in Ladakh as well as through our fans all over the country contributing towards offsetting our emissions.""In a world where performance and profits dictate a football club’s trajectory, 1 Ladakh FC is a testimony that sports and sustainability can merge in hopes of a cleaner future.",1 Ladakh FC are the first club from the Himalayan region of Ladakh. The two- year-old club will take part in the 134th edition of Durand Cup.

Poll How do you view the criticism Henderson received for joining Al-Ettifaq? Justified, he prioritized money. Unjustified, players have to earn a living.

Jordan Henderson will leave Dutch club Ajax a year before his contract ends, the club announced on Thursday. The 35-year-old joined Ajax in January 2024, just six months after his move from Liverpool to Saudi club Al-Ettifaq, which drew criticism over gay rights concerns.An outspoken advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, Henderson was accused of prioritising money over principles. However, he soon turned the page on the controversy as Ajax named him club captain. He went on to make 57 appearances for the Amsterdam-based side, whose shirt has been worn by legends like Johan Cruyff and Dennis Bergkamp.Henderson played a pivotal role in Ajax’s revival following one of their worst seasons. Under his leadership, the team mounted a serious Eredivisie title challenge. However, despite holding a nine-point lead with five games remaining, Ajax surrendered the advantage and lost the title to rivals PSV Eindhoven.Ajax Technical Director Alex Kroes praised the veteran midfielder, saying, “Jordan was a true captain for us, both on and off the pitch. Through his mentality and leadership qualities, he made a significant contribution to our qualification for the UEFA Champions League.”Henderson’s performances also earned him a surprise recall to Thomas Tuchel’s first England squad in March. Reflecting on his stint in Amsterdam, Henderson said, “To play for this club was an honour in itself. To have the privilege of captaining it was even more so.”He added that he would not be making further comments due to the “tragic events of last week, and the devastating loss of my former teammate Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva,” as quoted by AFP.","Jordan Henderson will leave Dutch club Ajax in January 2024.

Paris Saint-Germain delivered a commanding performance in their Club World Cup semi-final match against Real Madrid, securing a 4-0 victory at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford on July 10, 2025. Fabian Ruiz scored twice, while Ousmane Dembele and Goncalo Ramos added goals to set up a final clash with Chelsea, as PSG continues their pursuit of adding to their successful season following their French title and UEFA Champions League victories.The match saw PSG take early control with two quick goals in the opening nine minutes through Ruiz and Dembele, silencing the majority of the 77,542 spectators supporting Real Madrid.Ruiz netted his second before halftime, and Ramos sealed the victory with a late fourth goal for Luis Enrique's side.""We are in a special season, a special moment, and we deserved to win,"" Luis Enrique told broadcaster DAZN. ""We are going to try, one more step against a good team like Chelsea.

Real Madrid held off a late Borussia Dortmund surge to clinch a 3-2 win and book their place in the semi-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup, where they will face European champions Paris Saint-Germain. The match, played under sweltering heat at the MetLife Stadium near New York City, saw Gonzalo Garcia and Kylian Mbappe steal the show for the Spanish giants.Gonzalo Garcia, 21, opened the scoring in the 10th minute, slotting home his fourth goal of the tournament after an inch-perfect cross from Arda Guler. Ten minutes later, full-back Fran Garcia doubled the lead, finishing off a flowing move that included a cutback from Trent Alexander-Arnold. Real Madrid dominated the opening stages, stifling Dortmund’s rhythm and forcing them to chase shadows.Coach Xabi Alonso praised his team’s display but acknowledged the chaotic finish: “Everything was going under control… but the last 10 minutes were kind of crazy. Overall, a good 80 minutes and the last 10 minutes to improve.”Indeed, Dortmund mounted a dramatic late comeback.Maximilian Beier fired in from a loose clearance in the 93rd minute to make it 2-1. But Real’s response was emphatic — Mbappe, who came off the bench in the second half, produced a sensational overhead kick to restore the two-goal cushion.Mbappe, still yet to start in the tournament due to recent illness, now has his first goal of the Club World Cup and 44th of the season. ""It will be a great challenge for us to face PSG, but let's take positives from today and move on for the next one,"" said Alonso ahead of the semi-final showdown.There was still more drama to come, as Dean Huijsen was sent off for bringing down Serhou Guirassy, who converted the resulting penalty to bring Dortmund back within a goal.Despite the scare, Real held on, much to the delight of the 76,611 fans in attendance — a repeat of the 2024 Champions League final, but with far more twists.Dortmund coach Niko Kovac reflected, “It is a deserved win for Real Madrid. We showed our qualities and it is not a failure if you go home after a defeat against them.”","Real Madrid beat Borussia Dortmund 3-2 to reach the FIFA Club World Cup semi- finals.

Work and commitment

A late own-goal by goalkeeper Weverton took Chelsea through to the Club World Cup semi-finals on Friday as the Premier League side edged Palmeiras of Brazil 2-1 in a last-eight tie that had been lit up by a moment of magic from young star Estevao Willian.The teenage Brazil forward, who will join Chelsea after the tournament, was eager to impress his future employers and his brilliant 53rd-minute finish cancelled out Cole Palmer's opener in Philadelphia.But a deflected Malo Gusto cross went in off Palmeiras 'keeper Weverton in the 83rd minute to take Chelsea through to a semi-final showdown with another Brazilian side in Fluminense.""In the first half we were in control of the game and could have scored more than one goal,"" said Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca, dismissing suggestions his team had been fortunate.""They started the second half better than us and the dynamic of the game changed, but then in the last 25 minutes we were in control again and I think we deserved to win without being lucky.""The scoreline was a repeat of Chelsea's victory when the teams met in the final of the Club World Cup under the tournament's old guise in 2022.""Overall Chelsea was better. They have better players and a better coach,"" admitted Palmeiras coach Abel Ferreira.""They were lucky with the way they scored the second goal but it can happen in football and we need to accept it and move on.""Chelsea will now be fancied to go on and reach the final, with Fluminense standing in their way in the last four at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Tuesday.If not everyone has yet been won over by the tournament, the intensity levels on the pitch are rising as it reaches the business end and there was a big-game atmosphere in Philadelphia.Lincoln Financial Field was almost sold out, with 65,782 fans in attendance despite much of the city having emptied out for the July 4 holiday and long weekend.This game played out to a backdrop of Independence Day fireworks lighting up the sky over the nearby Delaware River, but there were fireworks on the pitch too.Chelsea lit the spark first, going ahead in the 16th minute thanks to a moment of class from England international Palmer.After drifting into a pocket of space just outside the Palmeiras box, Palmer controlled a Trevoh Chalobah pass on the half-turn, carried on into the area and dispatched a low shot past Weverton.It was the ideal start for Chelsea, who lost to Flamengo when they last faced Brazilian opposition in the same stadium during the group stage.Maresca added extra Brazilian flavour to the occasion by handing a first start to young midfielder Andrey Santos.With Moises Caicedo suspended, Santos occupied the holding midfield role for Chelsea while Pedro Neto lined up on the right wing, choosing to play despite having to come to terms with the tragic death of his Portugal teammate Diogo Jota on Thursday.Playing on the right wing for Palmeiras was Estevao, the 18-year-old Brazil prodigy set to join Chelsea in a big-money transfer agreed over a year ago.He knew this could be his last game for the Sao Paulo side, and Chelsea probably should have been two ahead before the interval only for Christopher Nkunku to blaze over after being teed up by Palmer.Instead Palmeiras equalised eight minutes into the second half, with Estevao the inevitable scorer.Positioned inside the Chelsea box to the right, Estevao controlled a pass by Richard Rios and took a touch to get in front of Levi Colwill, another to steady himself, and then surprised goalkeeper Robert Sanchez with an early shot that went in off the bar.Chelsea responded by sending on new signing Joao Pedro for his debut, the Brazilian becoming the 27th player used by Maresca during the tournament.The Blues pushed in search of a second goal but extra time was looking likely when the Premier League side grabbed a scrappy winner with seven minutes of the 90 to play.Following a corner played short, Enzo Fernandez found Malo Gusto and his attempted low centre from the left side of the box deflected off the toe of Agustin Giay to surprise Weverton, with the ball striking him on its way in.Substitute Hercules struck a 70th-minute winner as Brazil's Fluminense defeated Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal 2-1 on Friday to reach the semi-finals of the Club World Cup.A fine left-foot finish from Matheus Martinelli had put the Rio club ahead in the 40th minute but Al Hilal's Brazilian forward Marcos Leonardo levelled six minutes into the second half before Hercules stole the show to the delight of the vast majority of the 43,091 crowd.Al Hilal had pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament, beating Manchester City 4-3, to reach the last eight and Simone Inzaghi's side fought hard until the end to keep their adventure alive.They bow out of the tournament having been unbeaten through the group stage, including holding Real Madrid to a draw, and having truly made their mark on the world stage.There was a moment's silence before the kick-off in memory of Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota and his younger brother Andre Silva, who died in the early hours of Thursday after their car veered off a motorway in Spain and burst into flames.Al Hilal's line-up featured two of Jota's Portugal team-mates in Ruben Neves and Joao Cancelo.The first half was a tight and tactical affair with few chances until Martinelli opened the scoring when he picked the ball up from Gabriel Fuentes inside the box and span out to give himself space for a left-foot shot that rocketed past Yassine Bounou.Al Hilal went close to a quick response when Kalidou Koulibaly's header forced Fluminense's 44-year-old goalkeeper Fabio into a fine save.The Saudi side were awarded a penalty when Samuel Xavier was ruled to have brought down Marcos Leonardo in the box but Dutch referee Danny Makkelie was eventually sent to the monitor where he overturned his own decision after seeing there had been no contact between the two players.After going in at the break trailing by a goal, Al Hilal came out strongly for the second half and drew level when Koulibaly headed a Neves corner down to Marcos Leonardo who poked home.Al Hilal's Brazilian full back Renan Lodi had a let off when his poor backpass fell straight at the feet of German Cano but the Fluminense striker's attempt to round Bounou was denied by the smart work of the Moroccan keeper.But the outcome was settled with 20 minutes remaining when half-time sub Hercules saw a shot from distance blocked but from the loose ball Samuel headed the ball back to the forward who raced into the box and fired past Bounou to make it 2-1.Al Hilal produced a flurry of corners and some intense pressure in the final minutes as they desperately sought a way to keep their dream alive but the Brazilians were good value for their victory.""We didn’t have many chances but we made the most of them, the entire group worked and were committed,"" said Fluminense coach Renato Gaucho.""Our fans here in the USA and those in Brazil, they can be proud and I ask them to wear a jersey, in the mall, street, beach, wherever, wear that shirt – they should all be proud to wear that jersey,"" he said.The Fluminense coach was full of praise for the performance of his 40-year-old central defender Thiago Silva who ensured the Brazilians were able to withstand the second half pressure from Al Hilal.""Thiago Silva is huge for us, I worked with him 15 years ago, he is a coach on the pitch, very helpful and conveys calm and experience to the others. He is our captain and a leader and in hard matches like these against big clubs, its important to have people like him. He is key and fundamental,"" he said.Al Hilal coach Inzaghi said his side had been unfortunate to end on the losing side.""It has been a good World Cup for us but clearly we leave with a little bit of a bitter taste in our mouth because after what happened in that second half, we deserved much more,"" he said.""It was a tight match, decided by episodes, as happens in football. Fluminense are very well organised team that are having an excellent tournament,"" he added.",Chelsea beat Palmeiras 2-1 to reach the Club World Cup semi-finals in Philadelphia.

How the technology works

Can the visually impaired also enjoy the fun and thrill of a Formula E race? Yes, it’s now possible — thanks to a new initiative by Formula E and Google Cloud: an AI-powered audio race report. This initiative promotes inclusivity and makes motorsport more accessible for blind and visually impaired fans. Google Cloud will work with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) to conduct focus groups and user testing during upcoming race weekends in Berlin and London, with a full rollout planned for Formula E season 12.The project was unveiled by Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds at the Google Cloud Summit in London. It uses Google Cloud’s generative AI technology to create rich, descriptive audio summaries of every E-Prix race. These reports will offer fans a dynamic recap that captures the excitement and key moments of each race, available on demand shortly after the chequered flag.The initiative originated from a Google Cloud Hackathon held during the 2024 London E-Prix. It is being developed in close partnership with RNIB to ensure the final product meets the needs of visually impaired users.Sharing his enthusiasm about the collaboration, Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds said, “At Formula E, we believe the thrill of electric racing should be accessible to everyone. This innovative collaboration with Google Cloud is a fantastic example of how technology can be used for good—creating a brand-new way for blind and visually impaired fans to experience the drama and emotion of our sport. By working closely with the RNIB, we are ensuring this innovation is truly inclusive and fit for purpose, so that no fan is left behind. ”John Abel, Managing Director of Specialised Software at Google Cloud, added, “For too long, the visual nature of racing has been a barrier for fans who are blind or visually impaired. Google Cloud's AI technology will act as a digital storyteller, creating a vivid audio narrative that brings the speed, strategy, and excitement of Formula E to life. We are proud to work alongside a partner like Formula E that shares our passion for using innovation to break down barriers and connect people through shared experiences. ”Sonali Rai, RNIB’s Media, Culture and Immersive Technology Lead, also said, “Audio description transforms how blind and partially sighted motorsport fans can fully engage in enjoying the full racing spectacle—taking in the visceral sounds of cars on the track while feeling the passion of the crowd.”She continued, “RNIB has been working with Formula E and Google Cloud on this AI-powered podcast, which promises to give a full picture of the race in an accessible and engaging way for blind and partially sighted fans. Formula E’s commitment to working directly with the community to develop this technology is exactly the right approach. It sets a fantastic standard in inclusivity for other sports to follow and stay on track with new advances in innovation. ”The audio report is generated through a multi-stage process powered by Google Cloud's AI platform, Vertex AI. Google’s Chirp model accurately transcribes live race commentary. Google’s Gemini models analyze the transcribed commentary along with live timing data and other official race information. The AI identifies key events such as overtakes, incidents, and strategic pit stops and generates an engaging, fact-based race summary.Also Read: Berlin E-Prix: From Oliver Rowland’s World Championship win to Felipe Drugovich’s debut, there’s a lot to look forward to The text is then converted into natural, expressive speech using advanced text-to-speech technology, resulting in a polished audio report ready for distribution.

Sebastien Buemi wins third spot on the podium in Jakarta



Sebastien Buemi’s performance in 2025 Formula E season

Coming as major good news for Envision Racing driver Sebastien Buemi, the removal of a time penalty from the last Jakarta race has landed him on the podium. Buemi is now officially promoted to third place, while Nico Mueller, who had originally celebrated a podium alongside Dan Ticktum and Edoardo Mortara at the Jakarta E-Prix, has been moved to fourth.The five-second penalty initially handed to Sebastien Buemi at the Jakarta E-Prix for contact with Mahindra Racing’s Edoardo Mortara was recently overturned following a FIA hearing. Due to the penalty, Buemi had finished eighth in Round 12 of the Jakarta race in June. However, the reversal has now reshaped the podium — much to Mueller’s disappointment.According to FormulaE.com, additional footage from Envision Racing's roll hoop camera, which was not available at the time the penalty was applied, was reviewed in detail. Buemi had received the penalty for an on-track collision with Mortara.The FIA stated: “The driver of Car 16 (Buemi) argued that the new element shows his overtaking manoeuvre was legitimate, that he was always in control of his car, and that when the slight contact occurred, he was fully alongside Car 48 (Mortara).”They further added: “The driver of Car 48 agreed with the assessment and mentioned he barely felt the contact.Upon careful consideration of the circumstances, the Stewards find that no single party bears whole or predominant responsibility for the collision. Therefore, the Stewards decide to reverse Decision 12. As a result, the penalty (i.e., five-second time penalty and one penalty point) on Car 16 is removed, and no further action will be taken in relation to this collision. ”With this update, Buemi moved to 10th in the Formula E Driver Standings with 63 points. In addition to his newly awarded Jakarta podium, he also has one win this season, in the Monaco E-Prix during Round 7.Also Read: Nico Mueller happy with Jakarta podium but adds, “It could have been even better with Jake” Buemi will now head to Berlin for Rounds 13 and 14 of the Formula E season.

(Getty Images)

Novak Djokovic on retirement

Seven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic , 38, was defeated by world number one Jannik Sinner in straight sets 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 in the Wimbledon semi-finals on Friday, acknowledging that age and physical limitations are impacting his performance more than ever before.The Serbian tennis star was aiming for a record 25th Grand Slam title and an eighth Wimbledon crown that would have matched Roger Federer's record of eight men's titles at the All England Club.Instead, Sinner, 23, will now face two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in Sunday's final.Djokovic appeared physically limited during the match, following a leg injury sustained during his quarter-final victory over Flavio Cobolli.""It wasn't really a pleasant feeling on the court. I don't want to talk, in details, about my injury and just whine about not managing to play my best. I want to congratulate Jannik for another great performance. That's it. He's in the finals. He was too strong.""This setback follows Djokovic's withdrawal from the Australian Open earlier this year, where he suffered a muscle tear during his semi-final against Alexander Zverev.""It's just age, the wear and tear of the body. As much as I'm taking care of it, the reality hits me right now, last year and a half, like never before, to be honest. It's tough for me to accept that because I feel like when I'm fresh, when I'm fit, I can still play really good tennis. I've proven that this year.""""But I guess playing best-of-five, particularly this year, has been a real struggle for me physically. The longer the tournament goes the worse the condition gets. I reach the final stages, I reached the semis of every Slam this year, but I have to play Sinner or Alcaraz. These guys are fit, young, sharp. I feel like I'm going into the match with the tank half empty. It's just not possible to win a match like that.""Despite the defeat, Djokovic plans to return to Wimbledon next year. ""I think, regardless of the fact that I haven't won a Grand Slam this year, or last year, I still feel like I continue to play my best tennis at Grand Slams. Those are the tournaments that I care about at this stage of my career the most.""The Serbian champion emphasised his dedication to maintaining his physical condition.""The amount of hours that I spend on a daily basis to take care of myself, I'd like to challenge everyone who is out there on the tour to see if anybody takes care of themselves more than me. And I, unfortunately, don't get rewarded for that right now, with injuries at the later stages of Slams. But I was rewarded for many, many years.""""I'm just trying to make, I guess, the maximum out of what I have left. Again, I just got off the court, so of course, I'm upset and disappointed, mostly not for the loss, because obviously even if I was fit, I wasn't a favourite to win against Sinner, I know that, but I think I had good chances if I was fit.""Regarding Sunday's final, Djokovic offered his prediction.""I think I will give a slight edge to Carlos as a favourite because of the two titles he's won here and the way he's playing and the confidence he has right now. But it's just a slight advantage because Jannik is hitting the ball extremely well. I think it's going to be, again, a very close match-up like they had in Paris.""This will be the first Wimbledon final without Djokovic since 2017.","Seven-time Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic was defeated by world number one Jannik Sinner in straight sets in the semi-finals. The Serbian tennis star was aiming for a record 25th Grand Slam title and an eighth Wimbledon crown that would have matched Roger Federer's record of eight men's titles.

Poll Who do you think will win the Wimbledon final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner? Carlos Alcaraz Jannik Sinner

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner will face off in a blockbuster Wimbledon final on Sunday after both pulled off thrilling wins in their respective semi-finals in dominant fashion.Defending champion Alcaraz reached his third consecutive final at the All England Club with a hard-fought 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6 (8/6) win over American fifth seed Taylor Fritz. The 22-year-old needed two hours and 49 minutes in sweltering conditions on Centre Court to subdue the big-serving American. With Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio watching from the stands and play briefly halted due to fans feeling unwell in the 32°C heat, Alcaraz kept his composure to deliver sublime returns and impeccable serving.""It was a really difficult match, as always when I play against Taylor. Even tougher with the conditions. It was really hot today,"" Alcaraz said. ""I dealt with the nerves. Playing here in a semi-final is not easy.

NEW DELHI: Coach Gautam Gambhir stated on Wednesday that ""world-class"" Mohammed Shami and other fast bowlers will have an opportunity as a result of Jasprit Bumrah 's absence from India's Champions Trophy squad.India's hopes of winning the title were severely damaged after Bumrah was disqualified from the 50-over competition that begins February 19 in Pakistan and Dubai.In a perfect tune-up to the Champions Trophy, India, the top-ranked team in ODI cricket, crushed England by 142 runs in the final game to win the series 3-0.However, following India's victory in Ahmedabad, Bumrah 's lower back ailment continued to be the topic of conversation.""If he's injured, he's injured, whether it's me, whether it's the captain, we can't do much about it,"" Gambhir told reporters.""Obviously, we know that he's an important factor. But as I mentioned, people like Harshit (Rana), Arshdeep (Singh), Mohammed Shami, all these guys will put their hand up. It's a great opportunity for them to try and deliver for the country.""Pacer Harshit Rana made his ODI debut in the series and finished with six wickets in the three games.Left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh took two wickets in the last game's lone appearance.However, India's spirits have been raised ahead of the eight-nation Champions Trophy by Shami's comeback at the beginning of the white-ball series.After taking a break after India's 2023 World Cup final defeat to Australia, Shami, 34, recovered from a heel injury to play in the T20 matches for his country.""Look, it's always good to have a world-class bowler back,"" said Gambhir.""With his experience, with his quality, we all know what he can do with the ball in his hand.""After being made to skip games, Shami came back with five wickets in T20 and ODI cricket, but he bowled for extended periods of time with accuracy and speed.""Obviously, we were trying to manage his workload,"" said the former India batsman. ""That's the reason why we played him two T20s and two one-dayers. Hopefully, he's going to be fresh and ready to go in the Champions Trophy.""India's campaign starts on February 20 against Bangladesh, and three days later, they face their bitter rivals, Pakistan, in Dubai.","India coach Gautam Gambhir says fast bowlers will have an opportunity in Champions Trophy.

NEW DELHI: Former India coach Ravi Shastri criticized the visitors for not putting in the ""hard yards"" during the tour, but England skipper Jos Buttler defended his team's training routine on Wednesday.After losing 1-4 in the five-match T20I series , England, who did not train before the second and third ODIs in Cuttack and Ahmedabad, fell 0-3 in the ODIs.Shastri mentioned England's lack of adequate training, they still conducted a training session before the first ODI in Nagpur.""From what I've heard, England have had just one net session this entire trip, if not any. If you're not prepared to do the hard yards, you're not going to improve,"" Shastri said in commentary during the third ODI, which India won by 142 runs.Buttler took a different view.""I'm not sure that's quite true, to be honest. We had a reasonably long tour, a few long travel days. There's been a couple of times we've not trained, but we've certainly done plenty of training throughout the tour,"" Buttler told the media in Ahmedabad.""We obviously try and create a really good environment, but don't mistake that for a lazy environment or a lack of effort. The guys are desperate to perform and do well and improve,"" Buttler added.While England trained in Kolkata for the first Twenty20 International before the tour started, they trained in Chennai and Rajkot for the second and third Twenty20 Internationals.However, there were no practices before the fourth and fifth Twenty20 Internationals at Pune and Mumbai, respectively.Buttler claimed that England did not do enough to take advantage of the opportunities they had during the tour.""It's probably a bit of a similar theme from this series and the whole tour. We had a couple of moments in the game, but never enough to go on and force a result or win against a really good team,"" he said.Buttler hoped that Ben Duckett , their in-form opener, would recover from a groin injury sustained during the third ODI in time for the Champions Trophy , which begins on February 19.""He's obviously been playing really well and hopefully it's not too bad. We'll find out more, obviously, over the next couple of days, but it's a little bit of time. Hopefully he'll be okay,"" he said.""He's played fantastically well all tour. He seems to keep getting better and better. (We are) really pleased with how he's performing and he's been great for us,"" Buttler added.Buttler claimed that England's confidence has not been dented by their losses to India.""Not necessarily. Obviously, we want the results to build confidence and win games. That (would) feel a lot better sitting here and having won matches as opposed to losing. But look, we're up against a good side in their own conditions. They're probably the benchmark in ODI cricket at the moment,"" he said.""We've not played near our potential. We've had some moments in games, but never enough to force results or look like winning games of cricket in the last three matches.""""But the fact that we're not anywhere near our potential yet or playing individually or collectively where we know we can be gives us something to look forward to and believe that we can get there and be a dangerous team in the Champions' Trophy,"" he said.","England captain Jos Buttler defends his team's training routine on Wednesday.

Matthew Breetzke 's record of most runs by a batsman in his first two one-day internationals, which was 150 and 83, was eclipsed by the hundreds that Rizwan and Salman scored.South Africa had amassed an impressive 352-5 thanks to Breetzke's innings.Salman and Rizwan put together a game-changing partnership of 260, setting a new record for Pakistan's fourth wicket, surpassing the 206 put up by Younis Khan and Shoaib Malik against India at Centurion in 2009.As they surpassed Pakistan's previous best successful chase of 349 against Australia in Lahore in 2022, their scorching innings should help allay concerns about the team's weak batting.Salman scored 16 boundaries and two sixes in his 103-ball knock, while Rizwan blasted nine boundaries and three sixes off 128 balls.Earlier, after South Africa won the toss, Breetzke followed up his best-ever debut score against New Zealand in Lahore on Monday with a visually appealing 84-ball 83, laced with a six and 10 boundaries.Breetzke surpassed West Indian Desmond Haynes's total of 195 runs in his first two games in 1978, before being brilliantly caught by spinner Khushdil Shah. Temba Bavuma (82) and Heinrich Klaasen (87) both contributed to the tourists' impressive score, which was unabated by Pakistan's renowned bowling assault.As the batsman tried to finish a run, irate Pakistani fast bowler Shaheen Afridi aggressively argued with Breetzke because wickets were not falling.Shaheen and his opponent made physical contact and spoke back and forth before being separated by umpire Asif Yaqoob.Two of the South African team's four changes, Tony de Zorzi (22), and Bavuma, put on 51 for the first stand. Breetzke and the captain then put together a second-wicket stand of 119.After hitting 13 boundaries in his 96-ball knock, Bavuma was run out.In the final 10 overs, the South Africans added 110 runs thanks to Klaasen's quick 56-ball knock, which included three sixes and eleven boundaries.With 44 and 15, respectively, Kyle Verreynne and Corbin Bosch were still in the game, helping South Africa surpass 350.",Pakistan beat South Africa by six wickets to reach tri-series final in Karachi. Mohammad Rizwan and Salman Agha score hundreds as Pakistan reach 353-5. South Africa had amassed 352-5 thanks to Matthew Breetzke's innings.

Overall, it's a really great result,"" said Bayern coach Vincent Kompany , according to the BBC.After suffering their first home loss since December 2023, Celtic will have a difficult time trying to win the match in Germany on Tuesday. The winner will advance to play either Bayer Leverkusen or Atletico Madrid in the round of 16.""It's only a one goal difference. It's a big challenge, we know that but it's still a possibility,"" insisted Rodgers.Benfica defeated Monaco 1-0 on the road, with Vangelis Pavlidis scoring the lone goal. The home team had to play a large portion of the second half with just ten men.Just after halftime, a goal by Pavlidis gave Benfica the victory at the Stade Louis II. In November, Benfica had triumphed 3-2 at Monaco during the league phase.In his team's last five Champions League games, including a hat-trick in the thrilling 5-4 loss to Barcelona last month, the Greek international scored his sixth goal.Moatasem Al-Musrati, a recent Besiktas transfer, was sent off for Monaco in the 52nd minute when he gestured to the referee to request for a yellow card after his teammate Breel Embolo had been fouled. However, he received a second caution himself.Benfica will try to complete the match when they return the following week. The victors will play either Liverpool or Barcelona in the round of 16.Feyenoord defeated seven-time European champions AC Milan 1-0 in Rotterdam on Monday, overcoming the dismissal of coach Brian Priske and gaining the advantage to travel to San Siro for the return.Milan goalie Mike Maignan gave the Dutch a hand with a clanger as Igor Paixao's speculative third-minute shot bounced off his body and into the net.In a game played at De Kuip in pouring rain, that was the lone goal scored.""These evenings are why we do this,"" said Feyenoord captain Quinten Timber.""De Kuip was on it again. We were on it. On to next week,"" he added, with Inter Milan or Arsenal awaiting the winner in the next round.Earlier, a contentious stoppage-time penalty helped Club Brugge defeat Atalanta, the Europa League winners from the previous season, 2-1 in Belgium.Atalanta was penalized for careless play at the back when Ferran Jutgla gave the Belgian team the lead in the fifteenth minute. However, Mario Pasalic headed in an equalizer for the visitors just before halftime.That appeared to be the case until the hosts were given a penalty at the end when Atalanta defender Isak Hien's outstretched arm caught replacement Gustaf Nilsson in the face, causing him to go down.After examining the footage, the referee upheld his assessment that the touch was unintentional and not significant, and Swedish forward Nilsson scored the penalty.""I've only just seen the footage and I reckon that if you ask 100 people if that was a penalty all 100 would say no. It's very strange,"" complained Atalanta's Charles De Ketelaere.The winner of that match will next play either Lille or Aston Villa.","Bayern Munich defeat Celtic 2-1 in Champions League playoff.

NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill produced a brilliant seventh ODI century, whilst Virat Kohli secured a vital fifty as India defeated England by 142 runs in the final match to achieve a 3-0 series sweep, perfectly concluding their Champions Trophy preparations on Wednesday.Gill's splendid 112 from 102 balls was the standout performance, whilst Kohli (52) and Shreyas Iyer (78) played crucial roles in helping India post an imposing 356 after being asked to bat first.The Indian bowling unit subsequently took control, dismissing England for 214 in 34.2 overs to secure their second-largest ODI victory by runs against this opposition.England's familiar pattern continued as they faltered against spin following a bright start against pace from Ben Duckett (34) and Phil Salt (24).The pitch's reduced pace assisted the Indian bowlers as scoring became increasingly challenging throughout the match.Duckett led England's initial charge but proved overeager. After hitting Arshdeep Singh (2/33) for four consecutive boundaries in the fifth over, he attempted another but fell to a slower knuckle ball, caught by captain Rohit Sharma at mid-off. Arshdeep then dismissed Salt with a slower bouncer, caught easily by Axar Patel.Tom Banton showed promise in his first ODI against India, executing two impressive reverse sweeps but could only manage 38 from 41 balls with four fours and two sixes.Joe Root departed for 24 when Axar (2/22) bowled him via an inside edge, whilst Harshit Rana (2/31) accelerated England's downfall by removing Harry Brook (19) and Jos Buttler (6) in quick succession.England's position deteriorated from 84/2 after 10 overs as Indian bowlers maintained pressure with regular wickets, whilst the visitors struggled despite favourable batting conditions.Earlier, Gill's fluent 112, supported by Kohli and Iyer, helped India set 357 in their final match before the Champions Trophy.Gill orchestrated India's innings with his seventh ODI century - 112 from 104 balls (14x4s, 3x6s), lifting his average above 60, whilst forming century partnerships with Kohli and Iyer.The India vice-captain achieved the distinction of scoring centuries across all international formats at the Narendra Modi Stadium, including an IPL hundred at the venue.Gill demonstrated excellent technique against both pace and spin until Adil Rashid (4/64) bowled him.Kohli gradually found his rhythm, executing several impressive shots including three boundaries off Mark Wood and Saqib Mahmood.Despite reaching his 73rd ODI fifty, Kohli struggled against Rashid, who dismissed him for the fifth time in ODIs, caught behind after scoring 52.Kohli remained 37 runs short of 14,000 ODI runs, a milestone likely to be achieved during the Champions Trophy.Rohit (1) departed early, edging Wood to Salt, whilst Iyer fell to Rashid, unnecessarily chasing a delivery down leg-side.","Gill's superb 112 from 102 balls was the standout performance.

AHMEDABAD: With captain Rohit Sharma back among the runs with a splendid 90-ball 119 in the second ODI, there are hopes Virat Kohli will follow suit. The star batter will be expecting to regain some batting form ahead of the Champions Trophy in the third ODI against England here on Wednesday.While it may be a dead rubber, it is an ideal situation for the Delhi cricketer to spend time in the middle as India eye a clean sweep.The hosts have ticked most of the boxes in the series but some gaps still remain. In both matches, England's openers got off to brisk starts while batting first, a concern for new-ball pacers Mohammed Shami and Harshit Rana. With left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh , who recently became India's highest wicket-taker in T20Is, warming the bench, the management might be inclined to give the Punjab left arm pacer an opportunity in this game.Shami, who has taken two wickets (2/104 in 15.1 overs) in as many matches so far, has been far from his usual self. His lack of incisiveness and penetration upfront has meant captain Rohit has been relying on the spinners to pull things back in the middle overs.With Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel providing the allround options, the last spinner's slot will be a fight between the left-arm wrist spin of Kuldeep Yadav and 'mystery' spin of Varun Chakravarthy .On the batting front, Rohit apart, Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer and Axar Patel have been in good nick.As for Kohli, it was at this ground that his dismissal by Australia captain Pat Cummins in the final of the ODI World Cup silenced the crowd. That final was the only loss - and the one that rankles the most - India have suffered in the five ODIs they have played here so far.England, on the other hand, have frittered away good starts and found themselves in a middle-overs muddle. Can they pull off a consolation win?",India face England in the third ODI on Wednesday. Captain Rohit Sharma scored a superb 119 in the 2nd ODI. Virat Kohli will be hoping to follow suit after a poor run of form. India are looking to complete a clean sweep in the series.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118160078,imgsize-53366,width-400,resizemode-4/118160078.jpg"

India's head coach Gautam Gambhir has confirmed KL Rahul 's position as the primary wicketkeeper for the upcoming Champions Trophy , indicating that Rishabh Pant will not be immediately considered for the playing eleven.In the ODI series against England, Pant was the only player who did not receive an opportunity to play, while all other team members participated in at least one match.Rahul initially struggled at the number 6 position in the first two matches. However, he showed improved performance when he moved to his familiar number 5 spot, scoring 40 runs off 29 balls in India's 142-run victory in the third ODI in Ahmedabad.""KL is our No 1 wicketkeeper and this is what I can say at the moment. Rishabh Pant will get his chance but at the moment it is KL who has done well and we cannot play two wicketkeeper-batters,"" Gambhir told media at the series-ending press conference on Wednesday.When questioned about Axar Patel batting at number 5 in the initial matches despite Rahul's strong batting average in that position, Gambhir emphasised team priorities over individual statistics.""We don't look at averages and stats. We look at who can deliver when,"" he replied.The exclusion of young opener Yashasvi Jaiswal from the Champions Trophy squad was explained as a strategic decision to include Varun Chakravarthy as the fifth specialist spinner.""The only reason was we wanted a wicket-taking option and we know Varun Chakravarthy can be that option. Yashasvi Jaiswal has a long future ahead and we can only play 15,"" Gambhir said.Regarding Jasprit Bumrah's back injury and subsequent withdrawal from the Champions Trophy, Gambhir maintained a reserved stance, deferring to medical expertise.""Jasprit Bumrah has been ruled out. I cannot give details because the medical team decides in NCA and they will give (the updates).""The coach addressed concerns about Shubman Gill's performance across different formats. Despite Gill's impressive ODI series with two fifties and a century on batting-friendly pitches, he had struggled on the challenging Australian tracks.""Problem is we keep judging people after every innings.

Sachin Tendulkar Exclusive Interview: On ISPL, memories of tennis ball cricket and more

NEW DELHI: England captain Jos Buttler conceded that his team was comprehensively outplayed by India in the three-match ODI series, which ended with a crushing 142-run defeat for the visitors at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.England's struggles against spin were evident throughout their tour of India, where they also suffered a 1-4 defeat in the five-match T20I series. With the 2025 Champions Trophy set to begin in Pakistan on February 19, the team will need to make quick adjustments to their approach.""Similar to the whole tour, we were outplayed by a fantastic team. Our approach is the right one, but we haven’t executed well. They put a great score on the board. Shubman played a great innings. We got off to a great start again, but it’s a familiar story for us. We need to find a way to bat for longer. We were up against a really good side that keeps challenging us,"" Buttler said in the post-match presentation.England’s batting unit struggled throughout the series, with opener Ben Duckett and veteran Joe Root — the latter returning to the ODI squad for the first time since the 2023 World Cup — being the only batters to register three-digit aggregate scores across the three games. Their middle order, in particular, faltered against spin on multiple occasions, raising concerns about consistency ahead of the global tournament.Placed in Group B of the Champions Trophy, England will look to regroup before their opening clash against arch-rivals Australia on February 22 in Lahore. They will then face Afghanistan on February 26 and South Africa on March 1 to conclude their group-stage fixtures.","England captain Jos Buttler says his team was outplayed by India in the three- match ODI series.

Meanwhile, Paris Saint-Germain dominated an all-French match against Brest.Erling Haaland's double versus Madrid, his first goals in five games, appeared to have given Pep Guardiola's team a little lead, but the defending European champions are now heavy favorites to advance to the round of 16 going into next week's return leg in Spain.""It was a weird one.

Bellingham then punished the home team for more dubious defending when the England midfielder scored the game-winning goal in the dying seconds.""I don't know how to put it into words straight away, it's so raw and frustrating for everyone,"" said City defender John Stones.""It's a feeling of anger and frustration,"" he added.

NEW DELHI: Liverpool 's quadruple bid for the season came to a stunning end as they suffered a 1-0 defeat against Championship strugglers Plymouth Argyle in the FA Cup on Sunday.Having fielded a weakened side, Liverpool manager Arne Slot saw his decision backfiring, with Ryan Hardie 's second-half penalty sealing Plymouth's epic upset at Home Park.In another high-profile clash, Aston Villa inflicted a 2-1 defeat on Tottenham Hotspur , piling further pressure on manager Ange Postecoglou .Villa took an early lead through Jacob Ramsey's goal, and Morgan Rogers doubled their advantage midway through the second half. Mathys Tel scored a late consolation for Spurs, but it was too little, too late.The 2-1 loss in the fourth round came on the back of an exit from the English League Cup semifinals after a 4-0 second-leg humbling at Liverpool on Thursday.Plymouth's victory over Liverpool is considered one of the greatest giant-killings in FA Cup history.The Argyle, managed by Miron Muslic, a former refugee from war-torn Bosnia, had already beaten Premier League side Brentford in the previous round and secured their first league win since November against West Brom.Slot acknowledged Liverpool's underwhelming performance, stating, ""We were not having a very good day. A result like this is the outcome."" Muslic, on the other hand, expressed his delight, calling it a ""magical day"" for Plymouth.Elsewhere, Wolves cruised into the fifth round with a 2-0 win over Blackburn Rovers, courtesy of goals from Joao Gomes and Matheus Cunha within 39 seconds of each other.The FA Cup exits for Liverpool and Tottenham have ended their hopes of achieving a quadruple and winning silverware this season, respectively. While Liverpool can still focus on the Premier League and Champions League, Spurs' only remaining chance for a trophy lies in the Europa League.","Plymouth Argyle beat Liverpool 1-0 in the fourth round of the FA Cup.

Liverpool suffered a humiliating FA Cup exit as Championship strugglers Plymouth ended their quadruple hopes with a stunning 1-0 victory in the fourth round on Sunday.Arne Slot ’s decision to field a weakened team backfired spectacularly, with Ryan Hardie’s second-half penalty securing Plymouth’s memorable triumph at Home Park.Slot made 10 changes from the side that dominated Tottenham 4-0 in the League Cup semi-final second leg, resting key players like Virgil van Dijk Mohamed Salah , Andrew Robertson, and Cody Gakpo. However, the gamble proved costly, marking a rare misstep in an otherwise stellar debut season for the former Feyenoord boss.Liverpool’s fourth defeat across all competitions this season also represented only the third time they had failed to score under Slot. More significantly, it was just the fourth instance of a Premier League leader being knocked out of the FA Cup by a lower-division club.The Reds must now regroup quickly ahead of the Merseyside derby against Everton at Goodison Park on Wednesday. A victory there would extend their lead over second-placed Arsenal to nine points in the title race. Meanwhile, they remain contenders in the Champions League last 16 and will face Newcastle in the League Cup final in March.Plymouth manager Miron Muslic masterminded one of the FA Cup’s greatest giant-killings while battling to lift his team from the bottom of the Championship. Muslic, a refugee from war-torn Bosnia, moved to Austria at the age of nine after fleeing his besieged hometown of Bihac in 1992.Having already eliminated Premier League side Brentford in the third round, Plymouth entered the match buoyed by their first league victory since November, a 3-2 win over West Brom. Their determined display against Liverpool will go down in FA Cup history.Playing under a wintry sun on the Devon coast, Liverpool’s under-strength squad suffered an early blow when Joe Gomez limped off injured in the first half. The Reds struggled to generate attacking momentum, with Plymouth’s relentless energy frustrating their efforts.James McConnell’s long-range strike in the 36th minute forced a save from Conor Hazard, but Liverpool otherwise lacked cutting edge.The breakthrough came in the 54th minute when Darko Gyabi’s overhead kick struck Harvey Elliott’s raised arm, leading to a clear penalty. Hardie calmly sent Caoimhin Kelleher the wrong way to put Plymouth ahead.Late pressure from Liverpool saw Diogo Jota and Darwin Nunez denied by superb saves from Hazard, as Home Park erupted in celebration at the final whistle.Elsewhere in the FA Cup, Wolves secured a 2-0 win at Blackburn, scoring twice in 39 seconds. Joao Gomes’ shot slipped past Balazs Toth in the 33rd minute, before Matheus Cunha’s blistering strike doubled the lead moments later.Struggling just two points above the Premier League relegation zone, Wolves welcomed the distraction of cup success as they advanced to the fifth round.Meanwhile, Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou faces mounting pressure ahead of their clash against Aston Villa. Having previously claimed he always wins a trophy in his second season, the Australian manager is running out of opportunities to keep that promise if Spurs exit the FA Cup.",Plymouth beat Liverpool 1-0 in the fourth round of the FA Cup.

NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe 's timely strike secured a hard-fought 1-1 draw for Real Madrid against their fierce rivals Atletico Madrid in a tense La Liga encounter on Saturday.The result maintained Los Blancos' slender one-point lead over Atletico at the top of the table, while also keeping Barcelona within striking distance in third place.The match was a closely contested affair, with both sides displaying their defensive resilience and intensity. Atletico drew first blood in the first half through Julian Alvarez 's controversial penalty, which was awarded after a VAR review for a clumsy challenge by Aurelien Tchouameni on Samuel Lino.Alvarez coolly converted the spot-kick with a cheeky Panenka, much to the frustration of the Real Madrid faithful, who vented their anger towards the officials.However, Real Madrid responded swiftly in the second half, with Mbappe pouncing on a rebound from Jude Bellingham 's blocked shot to level the scores. The French striker's goal on his debut in the heated derby clash underlined his importance to the team and his ability to deliver in crucial moments.The second half saw Real Madrid take control of the proceedings, with Bellingham twice coming agonizingly close to putting his side ahead. The England international's headed efforts were denied by the woodwork and a fine save from Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak, who also produced crucial stops to deny Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, and Mbappe.Despite their dominance, Real Madrid could not find the elusive winner, leaving both teams to settle for a share of the spoils. The result left Carlo Ancelotti 's side clinging to their narrow lead at the summit, while Atletico will rue their inability to capitalize on their first-half advantage.In his post-match comments, Ancelotti acknowledged his team's disappointment at not securing all three points but expressed satisfaction with their continued leadership of the league.""The team is disappointed because they think they deserved more... but we're happy because we're still leaders,"" Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told reporters. ""In the second half we had total control, we had a lot of chances.""Atletico coach Diego Simeone , on the other hand, lamented his side's lack of composure in front of goal, particularly in the first half.""We had a good first half, but we weren't relaxed enough in front of goal to (score) more,"" said Simeone. ""In the end it was a draw in which both teams think they could have taken more from it.""The hard-fought draw sets the stage for an intriguing midweek clash, as Real Madrid prepare to face Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League play-off round.Meanwhile, the La Liga title race remains delicately poised, with Barcelona given an opportunity to close the gap on the top two when they face Sevilla on Sunday.",Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid draw 1-1 in La Liga derby on Saturday.

Enzo Maresca, Chelsea's interim manager, lamented the lack of VAR but acknowledged the result's consequences.""I think the handball is quite clear. Without VAR it's complicated,"" Maresca said.""The second half the only shots they had we conceded a goal from. We had a few chances at 2-1.

SHILLONG: Football frenzy was at its peak as the city welcomed Indian Super League and hoped to see NorthEast United FC script a memorable win and star striker Alaaeddine Ajaraie break the league’s goalscoring record at the revamped Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Friday.But while there was no dearth in their support – with a Alaaeddine fan getting into the ground and hugging his hero in the 62nd minute – Juan Pedro Benali’s men could not live up to the expectation as Mumbai City FC won 2-0 with goals from two former NEUFC players – Bipin Singh (41’) and Lallianzuala Chhangte (90+2’).The victory meant that the visitors leapfrogged both NEUFC and Bengaluru FC to go fourth with 31 points from 19 games while the hosts went a rung down to fifth with 29 points from 20 matches.With the fervent northeastern fans behind them, NEUFC started the game with gusto despite the celsius scale tipping to 10 degrees in what might be the coldest ISL fixture this season.It was the hosts, looking to make a winning start in their ‘second home’, who kept pushing ahead and creating moves to break the Mumbai City defence. Jithin MS and Nestor Albiach looked menacing on the left wing as they tried feeding the ball to Alaaeddine in the middle.The cheers of “Alaaeddine, Alaaeddine” around the revamped and upgraded venue appeared to have done the trick in the 8th minute when a Macarton cross reached the Moroccan in the box. However, to the disbelief of the fans, his header went just over the bar.But the constant attacks by NEUFC did not ebb as Petr Kratky’s men maintained a very deep line of defence, led by the in-form Mehtab Singh in the centre. And while NEUFC kept bombarding with attacks, Alaaeddine and Co. were unable to find a breakthrough in the final third.It was against the run of play and from a half chance that the visitors eventually broke the deadlock in the 41st minute.Bipin delayed his run to meet a Fernandez cross inside the box from the right and headed the ball in that dropped before Gurmeet Singh but still ricocheted into the goal for the Mumbai City breakthrough and brought the till-then cheers from the stands to complete silence.Benali’s men tried to regroup fast and restarted their quest to break the Mumbai City defence. But nothing seemed to be working for them as the first half ended with the visitors in the lead.Soon after the change of ends, NEUFC got a free-kick in a dangerous spot outside the box. But Nestor’s shot was easily punched out by Mumbai custodian Purba Lachenpa in the 49th minute. Incessant moves by NEUFC in the Mumbai half, only to find them curtailed by the visitors’ final line of defence continued to be the script for most of the remaining time.The match, which saw seven yellow cards being shown by the referee, was starting to get ill-tempered when it was taken beyond the hosts’ grip by none other than northeast’s very own Chhangte.Getting at the end of a long cross from the Mumbai box by Tiri, skipper Chhangte put his skills on display to beat the NEUFC defenders and send a shot that Gurmeet got a touch to but could not stop from rolling into the goal.",Mumbai City FC won 2-0 with goals from Bipin Singh (41’) and Lallianzuala Chhangte (90+2’).

PANAJI: The Derbi Madrileno or Madrid Derby holds plenty of promise. A depleted Real Madrid and a fired up Atletico Madrid are separated by just a point after 22 matches at the top of the Liga table.When the teams met earlier in the season, it ended 1-1, a feisty game that saw Atletico grab a stoppage time equaliser. The return leg could be a potentially season-defining clash at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday, even though Real Madrid are handicapped with several absentees, particularly in defence. Carlo Ancelotti ’s Real are now without Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba, who joined the sick bay alongside right-back Dani Carvajal, regular centre-back Eder Militao and midfielder Eduardo Camavinga.Even a makeshift defence will not dampen Madrid’s enthusiasm at home, feels Diego Forlan, the former Uruguay striker who spent five years at crosstown rivals Atletico (2007-2011) and won the Golden Boot in 2009, during which he scored 32 goals.""I don't think there's any advantage (for Atletico) because of the injuries,"" Forlan told TOI during a global media interaction, arranged by La Liga earlier this week. ""Real Madrid have a deep squad with so much quality. Many important players will be missing, but with a squad that Madrid possess, they are still at the top of the table. Even though they don't have the regular starting XI, I'm sure it's a team that you have to respect, because they will have others (who can dominate).""Forlan scored over 300 goals in a storied career that won him the Golden Ball for the best player at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. At the club level, the Uruguayan striker won the Pichichi Trophy — the award for the top goalscorer in a La Liga season — at both Atletico and Villareal. Yet, when it came to the Madrid Derby, Forlan didn't taste similar success.In his four seasons at Atletico between 2007 and 2011, Forlan played eight Madrid derbies that resulted in seven losses and one draw. The lack of success wasn't Forlan's fault; between 1999 and 2013, Atletico didn't win in 25 meetings with Madrid, until the arrival of Diego Simeone eventually changed their fortunes. ""Well, we were close to winning against Real Madrid on several occasions but lost or drew. That trend has now changed. So, whether you're playing at home or away, I think the Derby is a lot more equal today. They are now playing on more equal footing,"" said Forlan.It is Simeone's arrival at Atletico that has helped restore the balance. In the 41 derbies played since then, Atletico have won 12, drawing 14 and losing 15. Madrid, though, continue to be the giants, so does Atletico have anything to prove to their city rivals or the world?""There's nothing to prove, you know, for a side that has been great for the last 10 years, winning lots of trophies (even) at the European level. They've made it to the final of the UEFA Champions League (losing to Madrid). This is an important derby, like El Clasico. Atletico and Madrid have always had great players, the derbies were spectacular. Today, the stakes are a lot higher since it's being watched all over the world,"" said Forlan.While Madrid are struggling at the back, their attacking players are fit and firing. There's Kylian Mbappe – playing his first derby after missing the first leg -- Rodrygo and Vinicius, all striking form. At the other end, there's Julian Alvarez, Antonio Griezmann and, of course, Simeone's son Giuliano, ""a real fighter with similar characteristics (like his father), one of the best signings.""",Diego Forlan feels the Derbi Madrileno is now similar to El Clasico.

When does the mixed doubles tournament start?

What did the USTA say about the format?

US Open has revamped the mixed doubles format for the 2025 edition.

What was/is Mixed Madness?

What has been the criticism?

What has the USTA said about the criticism?

The US Open organisers have made a big change to their scheduling and format for the mixed doubles tournament, but not without criticism. Two weeks ago, the USTA (United States Tennis Association) moved the main draw start to a Sunday - following in line with the Australian Open and the French Open - which are 15-day tournaments. The new dates for the fourth and final Slam of the year were confirmed to be August 24 to September 7.The bigger change was announced on Tuesday (February 11) with the mixed doubles tournament set to get a massive change. Not without its share of criticism, though.In a bid to have more singles players enter the mixed doubles competition, the USTA have introduced a bumper $1 million prize money and a revolutionised scoring format.The event size will remain the same as last year - 16 teams or 32 players - but what will change will be the scoring structure and the timelines. The matches are destined to be shorter with the competition to be played over two days.The objective, the tournament organisers say, is to attract the sport's biggest stars, many of whom have long passed on doubles to keep themselves fresh for singles.The scoring is arguably the biggest change introduced. Early round matches will be best-of-three sets played to four games, with a deciding point at deuce. Tiebreakers would be at 4-all—rather than 6-6 — and a 10-point match tiebreaker would be played if the teams split sets, rather than a third set.The final, however, will resemble a Grand Slam match, a best-of-three sets played to six games with no-ad scoring, tiebreakers at 6-all and a 10-point match tiebreaker if there is no winner after two sets.Eight teams will earn direct entry by virtue of their combined singles rankings, with eight other teams given wildcards into the field.All matches will be played on the Arthur Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium courts.As per the plan announced on Tuesday, mixed doubles is set to be contested on August 19 and 20, during the week when the qualifying rounds for men's and women's singles are held at Flushing Meadows. Main draw in singles gets underway on August 24.""What I would say is the reason behind this is to appeal to more fans and grow the fan base around the world,"" said Lew Sherr , executive director and CEO of the USTA. ""But the way to do that is to have the biggest names in the sport participating in doubles, and to showcase them teaming up and playing in a different format, we think is exciting. In fact, we know it's exciting.""Sherr added that USTA had discussed a format change in the past but it never got going until they witnessed the thrill and excitement generated by the "" Mixed Madness .""""We've known and we've had conversations over the years, like, why don't they participate and we understand the scheduling challenges,"" Sherr said.""I think last year's task with that mixed madness event really informed our thinking, that if could unlock that week and free up the top singles players to participate, because it didn't compromise their fitness or their health going into the singles, there was a huge opportunity to attract them and that's what we saw.""The ""Mixed Madness"" was a one-night only, four team competition played last year during the Fan Week which precedes the singles main draw.With prize money of $500,000, the competition featured Naomi Osaka and Nick Kyrgios, Amanda Anisimova and Taylor Fritz, Coco Gauff and Ben Shelton, and Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas.Team Badosa & Tsitsipas took the trophy with a final score of 6-4 against Team Anisimova & Fritz.Paul McNamee, the Australian former doubles World No. 1, was among critics of the shake-up, saying it would devalue the US Open mixed doubles title.""Sets to four games in a Grand Slam? 16 teams with eight based on singles rankings and eight wildcards. I'm sorry, but the US Open now will not produce a bona fide mixed doubles winner,"" McNamee wrote on X, formerly Twitter.""Devalued from a Grand Slam title to an exo (exhibition). Let's just say I'm in shock.""Poland's Jan Zielinski, a winner of the mixed doubles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon last year, described the revamp as ""sad.""""No communication with the players, no thought behind what it means to some people's careers, no respect to the history and traditions,"" Zielinski wrote on X. ""Sad to see.""Last year's US Open mixed doubles winners, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, lambasted the decision in a statement on social media, labeling it a ""profound injustice.""""Making decisions just following the logic of profit is profoundly wrong in some situations,"" the duo wrote.""In the last few weeks we received the news that the US Open mixed doubles tournament will be completely turned upside down, cancelled and replaced with a pseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show.""We see it as a profound injustice that disrespects an entire category of players... we don't know at the moment if we'll have the chance to defend our title but we hope this remains an isolated case.""With the doubles specialists all but out of reckoning for the mixed doubles event, it will reduce the option to earn points and money for them.""Yes, there's some that will be disappointed that they won't have the opportunity to compete in this event,"" Sherr said. ""On the other side, we know that there's a huge opportunity to create more interest globally in doubles and there may be a cascading effect here, that the mixed creates a bigger spotlight on the men's and women's doubles when we get into that portion of the tournament.""We'll have to see how that plays out, but we do know that our mixed competition historically has been competing with the men's and women's singles, and so the fields have suffered and the attention has suffered. This is a chance to give it a massive spotlight over two nights.""",US Open has revamped the mixed doubles format for the 2025 edition.

NEW DELHI: The United States Tennis Association ( USTA ) has announced a significant overhaul of the mixed doubles event at the US Open.The mixed doubles competition will now be held as a standalone event in the week preceding the main men's and women's singles draws, scheduled for August 19-20 at the Flushing Meadows venue.The tournament will feature 16 teams, with eight teams gaining direct entry based on their combined singles rankings, and the remaining eight teams receiving wild-card entries.The USTA aims to elevate the mixed doubles event by scheduling it on the prestigious Arthur Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium courts, enabling more fans worldwide to witness their favorite stars compete for the coveted Grand Slam title.However, this move has drawn criticism from some quarters, with concerns raised about devaluing the mixed doubles title and limiting opportunities for doubles specialists.Former doubles world number one Paul McNamee expressed his disapproval, stating that the changes would not produce a legitimate mixed doubles winner at the US Open.""Sets to four games in a Grand Slam? 16 teams with eight based on singles rankings and eight wildcards. I'm sorry, but the US Open now will not produce a bona fide mixed doubles winner,"" McNamee wrote on X (formerly Twitter). ""Devalued from a Grand Slam title to an exo (exhibition). Let's just say I'm in shock.""Additionally, last year's champions, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori , labelled the decision a ""profound injustice"" that disrespects an entire category of players.""Making decisions just following the logic of profit is profoundly wrong in some situations,"" the duo wrote. ""In the last few weeks we received the news that the US Open mixed doubles tournament will be completely turned upside down, cancelled and replaced with a pseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show.""We see it as a profound injustice that disrespects an entire category of players... we don't know at the moment if we'll have the chance to defend our title but we hope this remains an isolated case.""","The USTA has announced a significant overhaul of the mixed doubles event at the US Open.

Indian tennis

looks to a 15-year-old now

PUNE: A little over two years ago, Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi lost in straight sets in the quarterfinals of a Grade 3 ITF junior event in Pune. ""I don't lose often. Maybe I will win it next year,"" Maaya, then just 13, had declared. Twelve months later, she did exactly that.Any lingering apprehensions were swept away at last week's Mumbai Open, a WTA 125 event. Unranked a week earlier, the 15-year-old Coimbatore girl now appears on the WTA charts at No. 646, putting her in the top-20 of highest ranking achieved on debut. The list includes Jennifer Capriati, Gabriela Sabatini, Monica Seles and the Williams sisters, among others.The teenager's arrival already spells hope for a beleaguered Indian tennis scene - starved of success, battered by apathy of the officialdom, and a court case against the national body.Imran Mirza, who once famously nurtured a prodigy, is very impressed. ""Her temperament is the most impressive part,"" Mirza, father-coach to Sania, told TOI, ""She seemed very level-headed. That's something one needs to go to the highest level.""We put a lot of pressure in India. With Sania, that was one thing we had to always control, the kind of external pressure there was,"" explained Mirza. ""There's already so much excitement with that one performance. She has a long way to go. We have to make sure she's not pressured into thinking that she's the only (one).""According to Imran, Maaya's parents - father Rajeshwaran who deals in procurement of construction raw materials, and mother Revathi, who co-owns a small business - are best placed to nurture her temperament. ""A child is bothered about what the parents think, not what the whole world thinks. Once the fear of losing comes in, it's very difficult to remove that,"" he said.Maaya's mentality reflects in her aggressive game. Even at 13, she wouldn't hesitate to put away a moonball.Manoj Kumar, coach since she was 10, said, ""We impressed upon her that to compete with the world's best juniors, she needed to be aggressive and at the same time become a bit more consistent.""Kumar underlined that Maaya was yet to complete her junior career. ""She hasn't yet transitioned into the women's circuit. She has done well in one tournament, she needs to do it regularly,"" he said.Transition to the pros has always proved the biggest hurdle in Indian tennis. Maaya seems to come well prepared. A little over five-feet-seven in her shoes, she has a good couple of more years to grow, putting on four kgs of muscle mass over the past year. ""I eat like a beast,"" she said recently.With the Rafa Nadal Academy offering her a one-year scholarship, the Indian is in a group of four players who are monitored by two head coaches and assistants. Last month, Miguel Fragoso accompanied her for junior events in India, but she can also summon the familiarity of Kumar in her corner.While the teenager will continue with schooling in Spain, Imran cautioned against too much tinkering with technique. ""In Europe, most of the training is more suited to the clay-court game,"" he said, ""There can be exceptions, (but) we seem to be more suited to hard courts because we have more skill in our hands, and in our joints than in the feet.""","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi, 15, is ranked No. 646 in the WTA rankings.

Jannik Sinner’s success has a lot to do with coach Cahill: Amritraj,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jannik-sinners-success-has-a-lot-to-do-with-coach-cahill-amritraj/articleshow/118122407.cms,"Vijay Amritraj

CHENNAI: Italy’s Jannik Sinner appears to be by far the most in-form men’s tennis player on the world circuit. Despite facing doping allegations, the world No. 1 did not let that affect him as he asserted his authority by winning the US Open and Australian Open.Indian legend Vijay Amritraj credited coach Darren Cahill for Sinner’s success. “The one major factor in Sinner’s game has been Cahill. I always knew that Darren had a very strong mental approach, and his ability to impart that to you and help you reach a point where you believe in yourself, where there is no second place for me – only first – has been crucial. And when I see Sinner play, I see a lot of that in him,” Vijay, who introduced Cahill to television, said on the sidelines of the Chennai Open Challenger. Novak Djokovic ’s decision to join forces with coach Andy Murray took Vijay by surprise. Djokovic and his former rival Murray began their partnership at the Australian Open, and the 37-year-old had a decent start to the season, reaching the semifinals.“I am surprised by Andy’s decision because he has just finished his tennis career, and to jump into something like this... you know, he has a family and would probably want to stay home. But he loves the game so much. I think they are a good match, and Andy can rejuvenate Djokovic to perform better.“Also, Djokovic’s match against (Carlos) Alcaraz was unbelievable – one of the best matches we have seen in a long time. Alcaraz is marginally more inconsistent mentally. He has more to offer in terms of his game,” Vijay added.The former Davis Cup finalist was vocal about the US Open’s move to add an extra day to the competition. He also stressed that the ATP reducing the number of 250-level Tour events is not a good sign. “By adding a day, they have killed the ATP 250 tournament the week before. The Slams are very important but let us not forget that you need tournaments in every part of the world. To become a Djokovic, (Roger) Federer, or (Rafael) Nadal, you still need other players to beat, right? These five or six guys alone cannot go and play the Grand Slams. You need another 100 players in the draw. So, I do not understand why they do not allow others to host tournaments.”'Trying to bring a big tournament to India'India lost its right to host an ATP 250 event a few years ago. In 2022, the country hosted a WTA 250 Tour event, but it has not been a permanent fixture on the calendar. Vijay has been pushing to host a top-level event in India but to no avail. “If you want to be a global sport, you need to have an event in India. When I was playing in the 70s and 80s, we had tournaments across all capitals in Asia. And you are saying none of this is possible? I am being very vocal with these guys about doing this,” said Vijay, who is the president of the Tamil Nadu Tennis Association (TNTA).",Vijay Amritraj credits coach Darren Cahill for Italy's Jannik Sinner's success.

Chennai: Soon after winning the Chennai Open Challenger men’s singles title on Sunday, Kyrian Jacquet humbly stated that he had not played his best tennis over the week. However, during the Frenchman’s journey to the crown, he defeated two seeded players and dropped just a single set.The 23-year-old Jacquet’s level was enough to comfortably beat Elias Ymer of Sweden 7-6(1), 6-4 in the final, a result that handed him the coveted title and 100 ranking points.At the SDAT Stadium , Jacquet made an early breakthrough, taking a 4-2 lead in the opening set. However, Ymer refused to back down, breaking Jacquet’s serve in the eighth game and pushing the set into a tie-breaker. But the tie-breaker was a one-sided affair, with the Swede making six unforced errors and leaving Jacquet with little to do.In the second set, Ymer’s unforced errors continued to give Jacquet an advantage and soon, the former was trailing 1-4. Though Ymer fought back, winning three games in a row, he faltered in the end. Inconsistency crept in, and errors began to pile up. Jacquet, maintaining his composure, comfortably cruised to victory with a double fault from Ymer sealing the win.Jacquet operated with the strategy of using his slices effectively, taking pace off the ball. By doing so, he disrupted Ymer’s rhythm, forcing him to generate more pace on his shots. “I played a lot of slices during all the matches because I like to play slices to change the rhythm. I try to destabilise the opponent. So yeah, I did well today (Sunday),” Jacquet said.Jacquet had previously mentioned that he believes his tennis is better than what his current ranking reflects. Last year, a string of injuries forced him to be sidelined for eight months, which led to a drop in his ranking. His performance in Chennai showed that he is on the comeback trail, proving his potential. “I play better than my rank, that is for sure. It was very tough last year, and I did all the work that I could to be ready to come here. I am really happy about the week because I was feeling better and better as the days went by. If I continue to play like this, I will go up faster (in the rankings).”Jacquet will jump above 60 places and get close to the top-200 mark in the ATP singles chart.","Kyrian Jacquet beat Elias Ymer of Sweden 7-6(1), 6-4 in the final.

MUMBAI: Going into Sunday's L&T Mumbai Open final, fifth seed Jil Teichmann was not aware if a win would send her back into the top 100 of the WTA Rankings .After a convincing 6-3, 6-4 win over Thailand's Mananchaya Sawangkaew at the Cricket Club of India , she knew.""My coach didn't tell me either,"" Teichmann said with a wide grin after picking up her second WTA 125k title in the last five months. ""For me it was definitely a goal to win this trophy. I am smart, so I kind of did the maths but I didn't know if it's going to be top 100 or not. The next little goal I had was to crack the top 100 again and to keep going.""Ranked 117 at the start of the week, Sunday's triumph launched the 27-year-old Swiss to 100th spot in the live rankings.The manner in which she played, not just on Sunday, but for most of this week, was a reminder, though, of why she was just outside the top 20 less than three years ago.Sawangkaew, the World No. 121, cracked under pressure from Teichmann's variety and precision in her groundstrokes, going down a double break in the first set. Even though she was able to get one back, the lead was too much as the fifth seed took the opening set.The Thai's forehand often let her down in the 1 hour, 37 minute encounter, and three errors in succession gave Teichmann an early break in set two. Though the eighth seed was able to break back immediately, the inconsistency in her game proved detrimental to her chances, as the Swiss grabbed the advantage once again.Sawangkaew did manage to draw level in the sixth game, but Teichmann banked on her lethal forehand, producing two timely winners to earn the decisive break in the seventh game.Her booming serve down the T has been another formidable weapon this week, and she landed one perfectly to bring up three match points. Sawangkaew saved the first but a deft backhand volley from Teichmann was a fitting way for the Swiss to complete the win, and take home $15,500.In the doubles final, Prarthana Thombare and Arianne Hartono endured heartbreak for the second year in a row, as the Indian-Dutch pairing went down 7-6(4), 2-6, 10-7 to the all-Russian combination of Amina Anshba and Elena Pridankina.","Jil Teichmann beats Mananchaya Sawangkaew 6-3, 6-4 in the L&T Mumbai Open final.

Carlos Alcaraz claimed his first indoor title at the Rotterdam Open on Sunday, defeating Australia’s Alex de Minaur 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 in a hard-fought final.The world No. 3 showcased his firepower from both wings, overpowering De Minaur, who defended admirably but lacked the finishing weapons to trouble the top seed.Alcaraz struck first, breaking in the third game with a mix of heavy groundstrokes and a costly double fault from De Minaur. The Australian, ranked No. 8, responded with a love break in the seventh game, leveling the set at 4-4.However, an ill-advised drop shot at 0-30 gifted Alcaraz another chance, and a powerful backhand pass set up the opportunity to serve out the set. The Spaniard capitalized, closing it out as De Minaur netted a forehand return.Momentum shifted in the second set, with De Minaur breaking early and surging to a 3-0 lead. He missed two chances for a double break but held on to even the match at one set apiece, sealing it as Alcaraz faltered with errant groundstrokes.The decider remained on serve until the sixth game when Alcaraz broke with a deft drop shot that De Minaur pushed wide. Serving at 2-5 to stay in the match, the Australian handed Alcaraz two championship points with a costly double fault.A weary backhand into the net sealed the Spaniard’s victory—his 17th ATP title — prompting a triumphant “Vamos!” as the Rotterdam crowd erupted.For De Minaur, it was a painful repeat of last year’s final, where he also finished runner-up, that time to Jannik Sinner.","Carlos Alcaraz claims his first indoor title at the Rotterdam Open on Sunday.

MUMBAI: Getting to the semifinals of the L&T Mumbai Open was already a massive success for Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi , particularly considering the 15-year-old hadn’t originally planned to play the WTA125K event.On Saturday, Jil Teichmann , an opponent currently ranked 117 in the world, and as high as 21 less than three years ago, proved a hurdle too steep for the promising teenager from Coimbatore. The fifth seed from Switzerland needed only 68 minutes to seal her spot in Sunday’s final, winning 6-3,6-1 to end Maaya’s remarkable run at the Cricket Club of India here.Teichmann will battle the eighth seed Mananchaya Sawangkaew for the title, after the 22-year-old Thai stunned second seed Rebecca Marino 6-2, 6-2 in the first semifinal.As much as it’s been a special eight days for Maaya, who was given a wild card to the qualifiers by the tournament officials, it’s also been physically demanding. On Friday, she needed to go to a deciding set for the third time in the week to beat Japan’s Mei Yamaguchi in the quarterfinals. And she would admit to feeling the cumulative toll on her legs, as Teichmann seized control of the match from the start.The 27-year-old Swiss, with two WTA titles to her name, successfully managed to neutralise Maaya from the baseline with her powerful groundstrokes to break the y oung Indian twice for a 4-0 lead. Then, a loose game on serve which came out of nowhere sparked Maaya’s best spell of the match. The home girl was suddenly swinging freely and delighted the near full-house with three roaring winners to hold serve for the first time. She knocked on the door again in the next game, earning two break points, which the experienced Teichmann did well to stave off and extend her lead.Having negotiated the teenager’s best spell, Teichmann was barely troubled from there on.The challenge of taking on a quality lefthander, something Maaya had been wary about following her-quarterfinal win on Friday, had proven to be a daunting experience after all.“It (playing a lefty) was worse than I expected,” Maaya would chuckle later. “Also, I did play a very experienced player and I felt that I didn’t play the way I hoped I would. Also I was physically a bit tired.”There were still “a lot of positives” gained from a week which saw Maaya come into the tournament unranked and finish with 55 ranking points.

He defeated the defending champion, Tommy Paul , in straight sets, 7-5, 6-3, to secure a spot in the final.Shapovalov's journey has been remarkable, as he previously eliminated world number four Taylor Fritz in the second round.In the other semifinal match, second-seeded Casper Ruud of Norway faced a tough challenge from Spain's Jaume Munar. After splitting the first two sets, the match went into a decisive third-set tiebreaker.

This marks the second top-10 opponent that Shapovalov has defeated in the tournament. His next challenge will be to face Ruud, the world number five, in the final on Sunday.Ruud acknowledged the difficulty of his match against Munar, stating, ""Second and third set (Munar) really stepped it up."" He also recognized the mental aspect of the game, admitting that he might have benefited from Munar's nerves as the Spaniard served for the match in the third set. ""I know what the feeling is like,"" Ruud said.""You can get tight. You kind of see the finish line a few yards in front of you and then you kind of stumble. I've done it myself and I was fortunate to be on the right side of it today.""In the tiebreaker, Ruud took control by hitting a backhand down-the-line winner to grab a 4-2 lead. He extended his advantage to 5-3 when Munar missed a backhand volley, and then went up 6-3 with an overhead smash.Ultimately, Munar netted a forehand to hand Ruud the victory, leaving their head-to-head record at 4-1 in favour of the Norwegian.For Ruud, this final represents an opportunity to claim his 13th career ATP title and his third consecutive finals win, following triumphs last year inBarcelona and Geneva.

NEW DELHI: Spanish world number three Carlos Alcaraz secured his place in the final of the Rotterdam Open on Saturday after a hard-fought and entertaining three-set victory over Hubert Hurkacz .The match showcased Alcaraz's resilience and determination as he overcame stubborn resistance from the Polish player, winning 6-4, 6-7 (5/7), 6-3.The match began with Alcaraz facing an early setback, as he was broken in his opening service game, allowing Hurkacz to take a 3-0 lead in the first set.However, Alcaraz displayed his fighting spirit, saving a break point with a brilliant crosscourt forehand and holding onto his serve.Despite facing three more break points, Alcaraz fought back, breaking Hurkacz's serve and seizing the game with a forehand smash after a lengthy rally.The momentum shifted in Alcaraz's favour, and he capitalized on a double-fault from Hurkacz to serve out the set, sealing it with a forehand drive volley winner.The second set proceeded more conventionally, with both players holding serve until the tie-break. The tie-break was a closely contested affair, with both players squandering chances to gain the advantage.Ultimately, a double-fault from Alcaraz at 5-4 up gave Hurkacz the opportunity he needed, and the Pole seized it, taking the set as Alcaraz netted a simple backhand groundstroke.The decisive third set started similarly to the first, with an early break of serve – this time in Alcaraz's favour. The Spaniard brought the crowd to their feet with his aggressive play, and his lead proved enough to break Hurkacz's resistance. Serving for the set at 5-3, Alcaraz booked his place in his 22nd ATP tour final with a trademark forehand winner up the line.""I want to be the first Spanish player to be able to win this tournament. I'm going to go for it. I'm really happy to be able to play a final in Rotterdam,"" said the 21-year-old Alcaraz, expressing his determination to claim the title.In the other semi-final, Alex de Minaur of Australia brought an end to the extraordinary giant-killing run of Italian qualifier Mattia Bellucci with a straight-sets win, 6-1, 6-2.De Minaur's consistency proved too much for the error-prone Bellucci, who was unable to replicate his earlier heroics against Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas.""I'm very happy with the level today,"" said De Minaur. ""He's been playing with a lot of confidence this whole week, so I knew it was going to be a very tough battle.""

Poll Did the weather conditions affect India's performance on Day 2? Yes, significantly Somewhat Not at all

Yashasvi Jaiswal credits Shubman Gill after maiden Test ton in England: 'I love it'

The capacity crowd at Headingley was up on its feet for what was going to be the last ball of the second day's play. A menacing Jasprit Bumrah was steaming down the hill, the floodlights were on, and thousands in the stands joined in the act, for one last time, for what was an absorbing day of Test cricket.Bumrah bowled a steamy last delivery, but Harry Brook survived, and the seamer turned and started the walk back to the change room. The applause continued, and it was surely not for an individual but for the day which unfolded. As the rest of his teammates converged towards each other near the pitch, Bumrah was already past the boundary rope and headed for the stairs.Both India and England had their moments, but the hosts would be the happier lot after the inspired bowling effort and then a strong reply with the bat.At 430/3, after another top start in the morning session, Shubman Gill-led unit was in the driver's seat to pile on more misery, but the collapse saw them add only 41 runs to the total and lose as many as seven wickets in the process.Around that time - Lunch interval - the clouds started playing hide and seek with the sun, and a brief rain interruption delayed proceedings, creating ideal conditions for the quicks.Overcast, floodlights on and gentle breeze.As they say, look above while deciding at the toss in Leeds, and the time for that look was now for the Indian bowlers. They couldn't have asked for a better time to have a crack at the opposition, but instead of creating their moments, the side let go of the ones which came their way.It wasn't a surprise to see Bumrah make the early inroad, but it was definitely a surprise to see Ravindra Jadeja drop a regulation catch and then Yashasvi Jaiswal do the same in the slips.Two of the safest hands in the team couldn't hold on to comfortable catches, and the hosts capitalised on the early reprieves. The day didn't turn out to be the way visitors would have wanted, and it wasn't just the batting and fielding, but the support for Bumrah from the other end, which was a major let down. Mohammed Siraj took a lot of time to hit the right rhythm, Prasidh Krishna was far too comfortable to deal with, and Shardul Thakur was summoned for just three overs.With the new ball, the erratic Siraj and Krishna meant that whatever pressure Bumrah created was released from the other end. There were far too many loose deliveries, and had it not been for Ravindra Jadeja's accurate darts, the scoreboard would have been much worse for Team India.Even without support, which was the story for Bumrah even in Australia, he was at it and ran in hard every delivery. He managed to pick all three wickets to fall and even had his fourth, but the overstep meant Brook survived off the no-ball and Bumrah had to end his day with just three scalps.He will return on Day 3 morning with the same intensity, but it will be imperative that he gets support from the other end, and from his fielders, to sustain the relentless pressure he will invariably create from his end.","Jasprit Bumrah took three wickets for India on day two of the second Test in Leeds.

The hosts would be the happier lot after the inspired bowling effort and then a strong reply.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122000489,imgsize-29294,width-400,resizemode-4/122000489.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Day 2 of the India vs England 1st Test at Headingley brought high drama, stellar performances, and a flood of hilarious memes, as Jasprit Bumrah led India’s bowling charge with sheer menace.Despite India posting a formidable 471, it was England’s gritty response, and Bumrah’s brilliance, that stole the spotlight and the internet’s imagination.Ollie Pope anchored England’s innings with a fighting century, finishing unbeaten on 100.But his knock wasn’t without fortune. Surviving a fiery opening burst from Bumrah, Pope narrowly avoided lbw, was dropped twice, and edged several deliveries into no-man’s land.The crowd may have held their breath, but social media had its own way of reacting, with memes poking fun at dropped catches, missed chances, and Bumrah’s almost-too-good-to-be-true spells.Bumrah was a one-man demolition crew, accounting for all three English wickets, removing Crawley in the first over, then dismantling Duckett’s stumps, and later nicking off Joe Root Yet, perhaps the most dramatic moment came when he had Harry Brook caught in the final over, only for the delivery to be called a no-ball.Social media lit up instantly with reactions, likening Bumrah’s overstepping to tragic love stories and unfinished revenge plots.As Headingley saw fluctuating fortunes under moody skies, online, it was clear: Jasprit Bumrah not only lit up the field but also broke the internet.Day 3 promises more action, but Day 2 undoubtedly belonged to Bumrah and the memes.","India bowled out England for 471 on Day 2 of the first Test at Headingley.

WV Raman backs Shubman Gill to fire in England: 'He needs the right support'

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has urged India to secure a victory in the first Test against England, following their commanding performance at the start of the match.India's first innings total reached 471 runs after being asked to bat, with centuries from Yashaswi Jaiswal, captain Shubman Gill, and Rishab Pant.Ganguly noted India's strong position at 359 for three on day one, suggesting potential for a larger total.""Nobody expects Headingley to be so dry. But what will happen is, if they get 600, it starts getting a bit up and down. India must win this. They won't get this opportunity again,"" Ganguly told PTI.The team selection saw both leg-spinner Kuldeep Yadav and left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh excluded from the playing XI.""Kuldeep will play slowly. It's a long series. I would have played Arsh. Because of a different angle (for being left-armer). But it's okay. They're good,"" Ganguly said, adding that Ravindra Jadeja will have to bowl well since he usually struggles away from home.England's bowling attack features Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse, Josh Tongue, and captain Ben Stokes, differing from their previous lineup that included James Anderson and Stuart Broad.""They bowl too short actually. Halfway through yesterday, they were bowling only short to Shubman Gill. But it's okay. They'll learn. It's just the first Test,"" said Ganguly.When asked about predicting a 3-1 series win for India, Ganguly responded, ""It's too early to say.""On Day Two, Jasprit Bumrah claimed the crucial wicket of Joe Root for 28 runs, while Ollie Pope remained unbeaten with a century.England reached 209/3 at stumps, still trailing India by 262 runs.Pope scored 100 runs off 131 balls, including 13 boundaries, and was joined at the crease by Harry Brook, who was yet to score.Bumrah's dismissal of Root, caught at first slip, helped maintain India's advantage in the match.India's first innings concluded after losing seven wickets for 112 runs on Day Two, with centuries from Rishabh Pant (134), Shubman Gill (147), and Yashasvi Jaiswal (101) contributing to their substantial total.","Sourav Ganguly urges India to win first Test against England at Headingley.

Gautam Gambhir and Jasprit Bumrah (Screengrab)

NEW DELHI: An intense on-field performance was followed by an off-the-field moment as a photo of Jasprit Bumrah in an animated conversation with India head coach Gautam Gambhir inside the dressing room went viral on Saturday.The image, captured during the final hour of play on Day 2 of the first Test against England at Headingley, sparked buzz among fans, with many speculating about the exchange between the pace ace and the newly appointed coach.Bumrah had every reason to be fired up. The Indian fast bowler was in devastating rhythm, claiming all three English wickets as England reached 209/3 in response to India’s 471.His scalps included the prized wicket of Joe Root and a brilliant delivery that sent Zak Crawley packing in the first over.A no-ball in the final over, however, denied him a fourth when Harry Brook was caught for zero, a moment that may have an impact on the outcome of the match.Despite dominating large parts of the day, India were left slightly frustrated by dropped catches and missed chances.Bumrah had both Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope dropped early in their innings, with Pope eventually capitalising to reach an unbeaten century.Bumrah ended with 3/48 from 12 hostile overs, clearly India’s standout bowler.On the batting front, India’s innings began with promise but unravelled dramatically. After centuries from Shubman Gill (147) and Rishabh Pant (134), India collapsed from 430-3 to 471 all out, losing their last seven wickets for just 41 runs.Josh Tongue and Ben Stokes shared eight wickets as England stormed back into the contest.But while England celebrated Pope’s gritty hundred, it was Bumrah’s energy that became the viral moment of the day, adding spice to an already thrilling Test battle.","Jasprit Bumrah and Gautam Gambhir had an animated conversation in the dressing room.

NEW DELHI: India’s young batting star Yashasvi Jaiswal produced a fighting, memorable hundred in the first Test against England at Headingley, Leeds, on Friday. Battling intense hand cramps and visible discomfort, the 23-year-old showed remarkable grit and composure to reach his fifth century in Test cricket.Despite the physical struggle, Jaiswal stood tall against a lacklustre England bowling attack, dispatching deliveries with power and precision. His aggressive intent never waned as he punished anything loose with confidence, scoring freely across all parts of the ground.Jaiswal reached his hundred off 159 deliveries — an innings that featured 16 crisp boundaries and a towering six. It was a perfect mix of resilience and flair as he carried India forward with an authoritative knock.The emotional moment of his century was captured and shared online by 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi, a rising cricket talent who idolises Jaiswal.In the video, Jaiswal is seen on 99 before nudging a single off Brydon Carse to bring up his hundred.His celebration was full of passion — a loud roar, a leap in the air, helmet off, arms stretched, followed by a warm hug from Shubman Gill at the other end.With this knock, Jaiswal entered an elite list of Indian batters who have scored centuries in their maiden Test innings on English soil.Murali Vijay’s 146 at Trent Bridge in 2014Vijay Manjrekar’s 133 at Headingley in 1952Sourav Ganguly’s iconic 131 at Lord’s in 1996Sandeep Patil’s unbeaten 129 at Old Trafford in 1982And now, Yashasvi Jaiswal’s unbeaten 100 at Headingley in 2025Jaiswal’s superb innings eventually came to an end when England captain Ben Stokes produced a beauty.

Yashasvi Jaiswal credits Shubman Gill after maiden Test ton in England: 'I love it'

NEW DELHI: Day 1 of the India vs England Test at Headingley was all about Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill ’s brilliance with the bat, but it also included a moment that stirred up fans online, a veiled dig at Virat Kohli by former cricketer and commentator Sanjay Manjrekar While praising KL Rahul and Jaiswal’s shot selection and patience outside the off-stump, Manjrekar made a seemingly innocuous remark that quickly turned viral.“So a lot of what you're seeing is being created by these two batters. And my hat, there's another example of it we know of. A former batter would have gone after that delivery and got himself into trouble, but not these two. And that's why I believe,” he said on-air.Social media users were quick to interpret the comment as a swipe at Virat Kohli, who has often struggled with off-stump discipline in recent years, especially during the India-Australia Tests.Kohli’s tendency to chase deliveries outside off has been a known weakness, and it appears Manjrekar subtly referenced that pattern.The comment comes just weeks after Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket in May, ending a 14-year-long red-ball career that saw him score 9,230 runs in 123 matches, including 27 centuries.Despite his achievements, Kohli's final phase in Tests was marked by a string of dismissals edging to the slips.Meanwhile, on the field, India’s new-look batting order flourished. Gill, in his debut match as Test captain, led from the front with a composed 127 not out and joined legends like Gavaskar and Kohli in scoring a century in his first Test as skipper.Jaiswal’s fluent 101 further solidified India’s dominant position, with the team finishing at a commanding 359/3.Though Kohli may have exited the Test scene, his presence and criticism continues to echo, even subtly, in commentary boxes.

England opener Ben Duckett praised teammate Ollie Pope 's century and discussed facing Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah during the post-match press conference on day two of the Leeds Test against India. England finished the day at 209/3, trailing India by 262 runs, after India posted 471 in their first innings powered by centuries from Yashasvi Jaiswal Shubman Gill , and Rishabh Pant Pope reached his ninth Test century and second against India, continuing his impressive form at number three. England's strong batting performance came after bowling India out from a commanding position of 430/4.""Yeah, I just think he was so calm coming out. You know, he probably could not walk out in tougher conditions with Jasprit running down the hill with the lights on, so, you know, to, I think at one point he was run-a-ball 50 or around that, so. It was great batting with him. I always have a good time out there in the middle with him, and it was goosebumps when he got to 100, you know, you could see what it meant to him. He is such a big part of this dressing room, and it was just great to see him be there 100 not out,"" Duckett said about Pope's innings.Pope has accumulated 2,124 runs in 29 matches at number three position, averaging 45.19 with eight centuries and seven fifties.His highest score stands at 205, maintaining a strike rate above 75.Duckett acknowledged Bumrah, who claimed all three English wickets, as the ""best bowler in the world"" regardless of conditions.""He is good in India on the flattest pitches ever, and you know when he is coming in down the hill with the lights on and it is swinging both ways, it is tough, and I feel like we minimise the damage early on. You know, it could have been a lot worse today, so I think we are pretty happy in the position we're in,"" Duckett added.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Speaking about Bumrah's bowling style, Duckett elaborated: ""First of all, how unique his run-up is. You are obviously waiting and waiting for him to get there, um, and I think just his ability to bowl three or four different balls with no cue. You do not know he is bowling a bouncer or a slower ball or an outswinger or an inswinger until it comes out of his hand, really. He has got such a fast wrist. So that is why you have got to watch the ball so hard with him. ""Duckett also praised England pacer Josh Tongue, calling him the ""X-Factor"" who efficiently dismisses lower-order batsmen. ""You know, there's nothing more frustrating than 9, 10, 11 (batters) chipping in with runs and putting on a partnership,"" he stated.England's day two performance included a solid half-century from Duckett, who scored 62 runs off 94 balls with nine boundaries. His partnership with Pope provided stability after Zak Crawley's early dismissal.India's first innings featured centuries from Jaiswal (101), captain Gill (147), and Pant (134).

Bumrah’s brilliance: Too hot to handle

Pope’s poise steals the session

Collapse dents India despite big total

Rishabh Pant brought Headingley to its feet with a spectacular hundred and Jasprit Bumrah once again delivered a masterclass in hostile fast bowling, but England weathered the storm through a tenacious Ollie Pope to end Day Two on 209 for 3 in reply to India’s imposing 471.Score: India vs England 1st Test Day 2 Trailing by 262 runs, the hosts found much-needed stability through Pope’s unbeaten century and stand with Ben Duckett, before a late strike by Bumrah brought some relief to the visitors.Despite Bumrah’s searing spells - which included the wicket of Joe Root and a near dismissal of Harry Brook off a no-ball - England showed grit and gumption, led by Pope’s calculated aggression and control.India began the day at 359 for 3, and the morning belonged to Rishabh Pant. Mixing audacity with calculated shot-making, he reached his seventh Test century with a breathtaking one-handed six off Shoaib Bashir. The celebration - a trademark somersault - underlined the intent. His innings of 134 came after a 209-run partnership with captain Shubman Gill, who notched a career-best 147.Pant’s brilliance felt like vindication. Six months after being labelled “stupid, stupid, stupid” by Sunil Gavaskar for his shot selection, the legendary batter was heard exclaiming “superb, superb, superb” on air as Pant reached his century.Jasprit Bumrah began with a magic ball to dismiss Zak Crawley in the very first over and returned later to remove Duckett and Root with deliveries that reeked of quality and menace. Duckett’s dismissal - inside-edge onto stumps - halted a 122-run stand, while Root’s poke to slip marked Bumrah’s 10th dismissal of the England star in Tests.He nearly had Brook too, caught by Siraj at fine leg, only for it to be called a no-ball - Bumrah’s third of the over. But his figures of 3/48 didn’t quite reflect how threatening he was all day.Coming in amid chaos, Ollie Pope showed composure and clarity. He was dropped early by Yashasvi Jaiswal and survived an LBW appeal by Siraj, but once settled, his footwork and bottom-hand flicks cut through the Indian attack.Pope, on 100* at stumps, constructed a crucial 122-run stand with Duckett and later added 80 with Root. His celebration, a jump and punch in the air, echoed England’s relief as Headingley rose in applause.India, once cruising, lost seven wickets for 41 runs after the dismissal of Gill and Pant. The collapse - as batting coach Sitanshu Kotak admitted - came too soon. “It was a collapse. We expected better,” he said, though he lauded Gill’s growth post-BGT and defended Pant’s unique method: “Just because he plays aggressive doesn’t mean he can’t defend.”","England end Day Two on 209 for 3 in reply to India's 471.

Poll Who do you think played the most crucial innings for India in their first Test against England? Shubman Gill Rishabh Pant Jasprit Bumrah Other

Dominant India on Day 1! Jaiswal & Gill Hit Centuries | ENG vs IND 1st Test - Sahil from Leeds

India may have ended Day Two of the first Test at Headingley with the upper hand, but England’s spirited resistance, led by Ollie Pope’s unbeaten hundred, ensured that the contest remained finely poised.Scorecard: India vs England 1st Test Day 2 At stumps, England were 209 for 3 in reply to India’s 471, still trailing by 262 runs. While Jasprit Bumrah ’s class shone through with figures of 3 for 48 - including the scalps of Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, and Joe Root - Pope’s gritty, chance-filled knock of 100* off 131 balls held the Indian bowlers at bay. At the close, he found support in Harry Brook, who was unbeaten on nought at the close.The day, however, belonged equally to the young Indian batting pair of Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant , whose efforts earlier set up the strong first innings total. Gill, in his first Test as captain, compiled a career-best 147, while Pant dazzled with a commanding 134. India’s batting coach Sitanshu Kotak, speaking after the day’s play, was generous in his praise for both.“After the Australia tour, Shubman Gill worked on certain things. The moment I saw him in the nets, I noticed.A lot of credit to him for analysing and working on things,” Kotak said. He also addressed the late-order collapse, which saw India lose seven wickets for just 41 runs, admitting, “It was a collapse. Batters also got out, we expected better but it can’t happen.”Kotak was also quizzed about Pant’s often-debated style of play, particularly given the keeper-batter’s mix of caution and aggression in Leeds. “Rishabh Pant gets criticised by who? Everyone has their own opinion,” Kotak said. “Rishabh Pant makes his own plans. He decides and he bats. This innings was different. Because he plays aggressive doesn’t mean he can’t play defensive.”On the dropped catches, Kotak simply said, “It normally doesn’t happen…”Pope, who made the most of his reprieves, found a fan in his teammate Ben Duckett. “Goosebumps when Ollie Pope got to a hundred! We are very glad for him,” Duckett said after the day’s play.Reflecting on his own dismissal, Duckett was full of praise for Bumrah, who knocked him over with a searing delivery. “Jasprit Bumrah is the best bowler in the world. Extremely hard to face when he is coming down the hill with the lights on. We minimised the damage early on.”Duckett added, “I don’t know what’s inside Pope’s head. But he is strong and scoring a hundred against that attack… the hundred meant a lot to him and the dressing room as well.”With Pope’s hundred keeping England in the contest and Bumrah continuing to trouble the batters, the Test is finely balanced heading into Day 3.","India ended Day Two of the first Test at Headingley with the upper hand.

NEW DELHI: It was a day when no Indian bowler toiled as relentlessly as Jasprit Bumrah . England, replying to India’s formidable first-innings total of 471, ended Day 2 at 209/3 — all three wickets belonging to Bumrah. As always, when India needed a breakthrough, they turned to their premier pacer, and Bumrah delivered.Bumrah consistently created opportunities, but India failed to capitalise. Ben Duckett was dropped twice early in his innings and made the visitors pay with a fluent 62, before Bumrah finally uprooted his stumps in his second spell.Ollie Pope, a nervy starter, survived the early phase and cashed in once the ball softened and the pitch eased out. He went on to score a century.Bumrah returned late in the day to induce a false shot from Joe Root and then seemingly dismissed Harry Brook — only to be denied by a heartbreaking no-ball call.That drama unfolded in the final over of the day.Bumrah, searching for his fourth wicket, bowled a short delivery wide outside off. Brook attempted a pull, mistimed it horribly, and Mohammed Siraj sprinted in from short mid-wicket to complete a fantastic diving catch.India celebrated, ready to walk off with the momentum — until third umpire intervention revealed Bumrah had overstepped. It was his third no-ball of the over.Brook survived and Bumrah walked back frustrated.Earlier, India were dismissed for 471 after being 430/3 at one stage. Shubman Gill (147), Rishabh Pant (134), and Yashasvi Jaiswal (101) headlined the innings with outstanding centuries. Gill and Pant’s 209-run partnership followed a 91-run opening stand between Jaiswal and KL Rahul (42).Despite the commanding start, India collapsed in the second session, losing seven wickets for just 112 runs. Ben Stokes (4/66) and Josh Tongue (4/86) led England’s fightback with the ball.","Jasprit Bumrah takes three wickets as England end Day 2 at 209/3.

MLC 2025: Faf du Plessis on why cricket's American dream is just getting started

NEW DELHI: Just as the drinks break was called on Day 2 of the first Test at Headingley Stadium in Leeds, Mohammed Siraj , ever the character, walked up to the stumps and casually picked up an England batter's bat, inspecting it with curiosity.Known not only for his fiery spells but also for his quirks, Siraj—who also holds a DSP post in Hyderabad—had beaten the bat on multiple occasions and extracted swing, but remained wicketless despite his spirited effort.Earlier in the day, England clawed back into the contest with a superb bowling fightback led by pacer Josh Tongue, who finished with figures of 4 for 86. India, from a dominant position at 430/3 with both Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant on centuries, suffered a dramatic collapse, losing their last seven wickets for just 41 runs and being bowled out for 471.India resumed Day 2 on 395/3 and added 53 runs without loss before drinks. Gill and Pant continued their sublime form—Gill stroked a delightful cover drive off Woakes, while Pant peppered the boundaries off Brydon Carse and Shoaib Bashir. Pant moved into the 90s with a falling scoop and then launched Bashir for a one-handed six over midwicket to bring up a spectacular century off 146 balls. He celebrated with his signature somersault—an ode to his gymnastics training in his younger days.Pant’s onslaught continued with more sixes and boundaries, but the 209-run stand came to an end when Gill, attempting to reach his 150 in style, holed out to deep square leg for a classy 147. Karun Nair, making a long-awaited Test return after 3,011 days, fell for a duck—caught brilliantly by Ollie Pope.Pant, after scoring a scintillating 134, was eventually trapped lbw by a sharp nip-backer from Tongue. Shardul Thakur edged to the keeper on the stroke of lunch, as England walked off smiling. Post-lunch, Tongue cleaned up the tail with sharp reverse swing, dismissing Bumrah, Jadeja, and Prasidh Krishna, wrapping up India’s innings swiftly within 23 minutes of the second session.",India bowled out for 471 on Day 2 of the first Test at Headingley.

Sri Lankan cricket great Angelo Mathews bid farewell to Test cricket following the conclusion of the first Test against Bangladesh at the Galle International Stadium. The 36-year-old walked off the field for the final time in whites after a remarkable career that spanned over 15 years. He received a guard of honour from the Bangladesh team in recognition of his contributions to the game.Mathews retires with 8,241 runs in 119 Tests at an average of 44.4, along with 33 wickets. He made his Test debut in 2009 and captained Sri Lanka in 34 Tests, including a memorable victory at Headingley in 2014. He finishes as Sri Lanka’s third-highest run-scorer in the format, behind only legends Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene “Since I announced my retirement, I can't believe the love that I have received so far. I am certainly overwhelmed. Ever so grateful to all those who supported me right throughout. It wasn't an easy journey; there were a lot of ups and downs, happiness and sadness. But through it all, I was able to do it because of the support that I have received,” Mathews said after the match.“(Emotional?) Well, obviously. Retiring from the best format, the format that I loved playing. It's time for the younger players to take the baton and drive Sri Lanka through.We certainly have the young talent in the dressing room. I should congratulate Bangladesh, they've had a wonderful Test match,” he added.ICC Chairman Jay Shah also extended his wishes, writing, “Congratulations on a fantastic Test career, Angelo Mathews! More than 8000 runs across 16 years shows your dedication and longevity in whites, and sets an example for future stars of the game.”When asked about his fondest memories in Test cricket, Mathews reflected, “The win against England in England and whitewashing the Australians in Sri Lanka 3-0, that was a huge highlight and honour achieved by the entire team. I am thankful to all the players who have supported me throughout, the coaches, and all the fans for being there with me. The love that I have received, thank you so much.”The match itself ended in a tense draw—the first of the 2025–27 World Test Championship cycle. Chasing 296 in 37 overs, Sri Lanka opted for caution and closed at 72/4. Mathews, fittingly, was one of the wickets claimed in the final session, with Taijul Islam (3/23) leading the late charge for Bangladesh.","Angelo Mathews retires with 8,241 runs in 119 Tests at an average of 44.4, along with 33 wickets.

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar has lauded Rishabh Pant ’s unique and fearless shot-making, specifically highlighting the left-hander’s distinctive falling paddle sweep during his blistering 134 off 178 balls in the first Test at Headingley. Tendulkar called the stroke not an accident, but a product of sharp cricketing intelligence.""Rishabh's falling paddle sweep is not accidental. It is intentional and extremely clever. Going down with the shot allows him to get under the ball and scoop it over leg slip with control,"" Tendulkar wrote on X (formerly Twitter), praising Pant’s calculated execution against spinner Shoaib Bashir.Tendulkar also observed the subtle mind games being played between the wickets during the partnership between skipper Shubman Gill and Pant.“Also noticed something interesting during Bashir's spell. Shubman and Rishabh were speaking loudly in Hindi between deliveries. It wasn't just casual talk. They were playing mind games with the bowler, trying to disrupt his rhythm. These minor details may not appear on the scoreboard, but they can have a significant impact on the game,” he added.After Yashasvi Jaiswal ’s aggressive 101 off 159 balls gave India a solid start, the Gill-Pant duo took charge and stitched together a commanding 209-run partnership.The stand put England’s inexperienced bowling attack under immense pressure, particularly during the second session of Day 1.While Pant switched gears with flair, Gill held a steady tempo, setting the tone of the innings with his composed 147 off 227 balls.

Liverpool’s biggest-ever transfer! Florian Wirtz joins Premier League club from Bayer Leverkusen in stunning record deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/liverpools-biggest-ever-transfer-florian-wirtz-joins-premier-league-club-from-bayer-leverkusen-in-stunning-record-deal/articleshow/121985525.cms,"Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz (AP Photo)

Florian Wirtz has joined Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen for a club-record fee, following the Reds' 20th English top-flight title victory under Arne Slot. Former Liverpool midfielder and Wirtz's ex-coach Xabi Alonso has already recognised him as one of the world's best players.British media has reported that Liverpool will pay up to £116 million ($157 million) for the attacking midfielder. German sources suggest an even higher fee, beginning at 130 million euros (£111 million, $149 million) with potential add-ons reaching 150 million euros.A dispute arose between Cologne and Leverkusen five years ago when Leverkusen signed the teenage Wirtz at age 17. Cologne claimed a gentleman's agreement regarding youth players was broken, but Leverkusen maintained Wirtz was a first-team signing.Wirtz's progress was halted by a cruciate knee ligament injury in March 2022, keeping him sidelined for 10 months. Upon his return, he found Alonso as the new Leverkusen manager, leading to the club's most successful period.Under their partnership, Leverkusen ended Bayern Munich's Bundesliga dominance, securing both the league title and German Cup without losing a match in 2023/24. Wirtz celebrated the title-clinching match against Werder Bremen with his first career hat-trick, later earning the Bundesliga player of the year award.""Flo is one of the top players in the world, he's world class,"" said Real Madrid coach Alonso, who compared his protégé to Lionel Messi in terms of his understanding of the game.""Why is Messi so good? Because he knows how and when to play simple passes. Messi says: 'You're in a better position? Here, there you have the ball'. It's not always about making the most brilliant move, but the best and smartest. Florian can do that. That's why he's so good.""Both Wirtz and Alonso initially committed to staying at Leverkusen for another year. However, their Europa League final loss to Atalanta in 2023/24 marked a turning point.Bayern Munich regained control of German football the following season but failed to convince Wirtz to join them. Instead, he chose to move to the Premier League champions.""I'm really excited to have a new adventure in front of me. This was also a big point of my thoughts: that I want to have something completely new, to go out of the Bundesliga and to join the Premier League,"" said Wirtz. ""I spoke also with some players who played there and they told me that it's perfect for me and every pitch is perfect, you can enjoy every game. I'm really looking forward to playing my first game.""Despite his impressive record of 57 goals and 65 assists in 197 games for Leverkusen, Wirtz will start his Liverpool career alongside Mohamed Salah. Liverpool sees Wirtz's creative abilities as key to maintaining Salah's scoring record and supporting the team's attack.The club might sell their previous record signing, Darwin Nunez, who cost £85 million but hasn't met expectations, to offset some of their recent spending.

Dutch soccer player Quincy Promes was being extradited Friday from Dubai to the Netherlands, where he faces a prison sentence for involvement in cocaine smuggling, the prosecutor's office told The Associated Press.The Dutch public prosecution service confirmed to the AP that Promes was en route to the Netherlands, in Dutch custody. Promes, who scored seven goals in 50 international matches for the Netherlands before legal issues derailed his international career, was convicted last year of complicity in cocaine smuggling and sentenced in his absence to six years in prison.Amsterdam District Court ruled that Promes was involved in the import and export of hundreds of kilograms (pounds) of cocaine in 2020. His lawyers told judges he denied the allegations. In 2023, Promes was found guilty of stabbing his cousin in the leg and was sentenced to 18 months in prison.Both of Promes' convictions are currently under appeal. Promes, a 33-year-old former player for Ajax and Sevilla, had been playing for Spartak Moscow and living in Russia from 2021 until last year, when he was reportedly arrested in Dubai around the time that Spartak was there for friendly games. More recently, he had been playing with United FC, a second-tier club in Dubai.","Quincy Promes was being extradited Friday from Dubai to the Netherlands.

A visit to the White House by Juventus players took an unexpected turn when US President Donald Trump posed a surprising question about transgender athletes. The Juventus squad, in the United States to compete in the Club World Cup, found themselves in an awkward moment during the meeting.After commending Juventus as a “great team,” Trump suddenly asked, “Could a woman make your team, fellas?” According to The Guardian, the Juventus players responded with nervous smiles but remained silent. Video footage of the exchange shows the players exchanging confused glances, clearly caught off guard by the question. FIFA President Gianni Infantino was also present during the interaction.Trump repeated the question, prompting Juventus’s general manager Damien Comolli to step in with a diplomatic response: “We have a very good women’s team,” referring to Juventus Women, the current Serie A champions. Trump quickly countered, “But they should be playing with women,” leaving Comolli without a reply. The US President then remarked, “See they are being very diplomatic,” before the meeting concluded with the team presenting Trump a Juventus club shirt.This incident comes in the wake of an executive order signed by Trump in February that barred transgender athletes from participating in women’s sports. The order, criticized by human rights advocates as discriminatory, not only set regulations but also instructed the US Department of Education to investigate schools suspected of non-compliance.Following the awkward encounter, Juventus showed their strength on the field later that day, securing a commanding 5-0 victory over Al Ain from the United Arab Emirates at Washington DC’s Audi Field.",US President Donald Trump asked Juventus players if a woman could make their team.

How Formula E is making an impact in Jakarta

Jakarta Race Promo: Heat, Grit & Gen3 Evo on Street Wheels | Formula E S11 R12

Formula E is not only introducing the fastest electric car, the GEN3 Evo, at the Jakarta E-Prix this year but also making an impact off the track. Several Formula E members participated in a beach clean-up on Thursday at Pantai Beach in the Ancol resort, where the race will be held. They are also engaging in local partnerships, educational initiatives, and community outreach to help reduce the environmental impact in the city.On Thursday, June 19, Formula E, Waste4Change, and over 100 volunteers—including FE team members and drivers—joined local community members for a large-scale beach clean-up. The initiative focused on conserving marine habitats and addressing waste management, a key issue in coastal Jakarta.Julia Pallé, VP of Sustainability at Formula E, said about the drive: “Plastic pollution is a growing problem that affects everyone around the world and is a growing challenge here in Jakarta — threatening both coastal habitats and the health of nearby communities. At every race, we are committed to engaging with local communities and aim to leave a place better than we found it. We are united as a championship with the community to clean the local area of plastic rubbish and ensure it is sustainably managed and not put back into landfill.To further minimize waste at the event, free hydration stations will provide water refills to reduce reliance on single-use plastic bottles. Visitors will also receive biodegradable eco-cups made from corn starch flour as an alternative to traditional plastic. Six dedicated waste stations will be set up for proper recycling and plastic waste management.Formula E has undertaken several more sustainability initiatives in Jakarta. A Formula E delegation visited the Waste4Change recycling center on Tuesday to learn about effective waste management practices and the role of the circular economy in conserving resources.On Wednesday, a school visit featured a panel talk on environmental education and youth leadership, along with art and cultural exchanges between students and Formula E members.Following the race, a paddock plant donation is scheduled. Trees and plants used during the event will be donated to local schools. After the race on Saturday, Formula E will host a ceremony on-site with local school students to mark the donation.Also Read: Jakarta E-Prix 2025: Schedule, how to watch Round 12 Formula E race, weather prediction In addition, Formula E’s Better Futures Fund is providing a €25,000 donation to Yayasan Perempuan dan Anak Amirah. The “Climateability: From the Margins to the Frontlines” project aims to empower women, people with disabilities, and youth groups most vulnerable to climate impacts. It will include inclusive leadership workshops, digital storytelling, training, and the development of a Climate Sign Language Glossary in Bisindo.","Formula E members participated in a beach clean-up on Thursday at Pantai Beach in the Ancol resort, where the race will be held.

Jakarta E‑Prix Essentials: Everything You Need to Know | Formula E Season 11, Round 12

Season 11 of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship is coming to a close, with five races remaining on the calendar. The Jakarta E-Prix is a crucial race, and it's hard to predict who may lift the trophy in Indonesia this year. The current season has already seen seven different race winners and fifteen drivers on the podium. Not only that, but every single team has achieved a podium finish so far — a clear indication of how tight and unpredictable the competition is.Nissan's Oliver Rowland is far ahead of the competition so far, as he dominates the FIA Drivers' World Championship standings with 171 points — significantly ahead of Pascal Wehrlein, who sits in second position with 103 points for TAG Heuer Porsche. Rowland has a total of four wins and three second-place finishes this season, and he may continue his winning streak in Jakarta as well.Maserati MSG Racing’s Maximilian Gunther is being counted among the hot favourites to bag a podium at the Jakarta E-Prix. He has two wins under his belt this year and will be trying his best to maintain his stronghold in the city and add more points to his tally.He had secured third place in the Part 1 race in 2023, having started from Julius Bar Pole Position — a historic moment as Maserati's first single-seater motorsport pole since 1958.He again bagged the pole the next day of the double-header and went on to win his first race in the iconic blue livery of Maserati MSG Racing. It marked Maserati’s first single-seater championship podium since Juan Manuel Fangio's 1957 German Grand Prix victory, en route to that year’s Formula One title.Pascal Wehrlein won one of the two races at the Jakarta E-Prix’s last edition, and the TAG Heuer Porsche driver is very much in form at present, with a win in Miami and three more podium finishes in the Formula E 2025 World Championship so far. He is second in the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings with 103 points and will be aiming for a win to catch up with Rowland.Jaguar TCS Racing’s Mitch Evans has been away from the podium for a long time now after winning the first race of this season in Sao Paulo. But this could also indicate his growing hunger for a win — or at least another podium — possibly in Jakarta, before the season comes to a close. Evans had won the first edition of the Jakarta E-Prix in 2022, when three drivers crossed the line within a single second. The other two drivers were Jean-Éric Vergne and Edoardo Mortara, who took second and third positions in that Season 8 race.He also bagged the third spot on the podium in Race 2 of the Jakarta double-header in 2023. This makes him one of the strong contenders to make a comeback on the podium.Also Read: Jakarta E-Prix 2025: Schedule, how to watch Round 12 Formula E race, weather prediction Since Nick Cassidy and Sebastien Buemi have also ended their race droughts this year, one can expect a new winner in Jakarta as well. The E-Prix begins on Friday with the free practice session and will conclude on Saturday with the final race in the early evening. The heat is on — but rain is likely, and that’s enough to add to the unpredictability factor.","Season 11 of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship is coming to a close.

All about the Jakarta International E-Prix Circuit in Ancol



Inside Jakarta’s Street Circuit | Formula E Season 11 Round 12

Formula E S11 Mid-Season Highlights: Best Moments So Far

As the Formula E season reaches Round 12, the drivers are set to head to Indonesia for the Jakarta E-Prix. The single-header will be held at the picturesque Ancol Beach street track in Jakarta on June 21. The venue is Southeast Asia’s largest park, which sees around 40,000 visitors a day. The race marks the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship’s return to Jakarta after Season 9. Here’s all about the track that will host the Gen3 Evo race for the first time.The design of the 2.37 km Ancol Beach track is inspired by the Kuda Lumping—a flat horse woven from bamboo and decorated with colourfully painted cloth, which a dancer rides for the traditional Javanese dance. The dancers appear to enter a trance-like state during the dance, which requires a lot of physical power.The track features unique banked sections, undulations, bumps, and a mix of technical and high-speed zones, all expected to test the skill of the Formula E drivers. The 18-turn circuit kicks off with a tight opening sector after a long run down the start/finish straight. There is plenty of room for manoeuvre into the right-hander at Turn 1 before drivers head into a flowing series of turns that swoop by Ancol Beach City.The final sector is a tricky complex following a fast right-hander at Turn 12 and another long straight into what will be a busy Turn 13 hairpin.

'Nothing new': Rohit Sharma on his struggles ahead of England ODIs

What does Shubman Gill's horoscope say about his captaincy future

Rohit Sharma's batting in ODIs has been game changing: Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer and ex-head coach Ravi Shastri understands the significance of the intense rivalry between India and Pakistan in international cricket. He recently shared his thoughts on current head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s remarks ahead of their highly anticipated ICC Champions Trophy clash.India and Pakistan, both placed in Group A of the tournament, will face off on February 23 in Dubai. The two teams last met at the venue in an ICC event in 2021, where Pakistan secured a dominant 10-wicket victory.Gambhir recently stated that the Champions Trophy group-stage match against Pakistan holds the same importance as any other fixture in the tournament, emphasizing that all games carry equal value.Speaking on the latest edition of The ICC Review, Shastri acknowledged that he had expressed a similar sentiment during his tenure as head coach but hinted that there is more to it than meets the eye.“I was the coach for seven years. Whenever I was asked, I said the same thing (as Gambhir). But let me assure you, deep down, there's a lot more to that than you actually think, that's for the media,” Shastri said.“You have to say it. But deep down, you want to win that. Because if you don't, you'll be reminded of it until the next time you play against Pakistan.“People don't care what you have done in the past. They're not bothered about the last 10 games if you won eight or you won nine. But they'll remind you if you lose one, until the next time you play them.“It can be a taxi driver, it could be anyone on the street. What happened to India? The same question to Pakistan. What happened to Pakistan? So it always plays on your mind, so whether you like it or not, it's a different game. Different beasts altogether.”Shastri, however, believes that the throwback won’t be taking up much headspace for Indian players.“No, that won't play on their mind because that was a T20 game. This is a 50-over clash. It's totally different,"" Shastri said.“And it's a longer game which suits India more, because in T20 you can get upset. In 50-over cricket, if you've got experience and you've got depth in your batting and bowling departments and you know, it makes a massive, massive difference.“And when you look at India and Pakistan man to man, India is a far better side and far more experienced as well.”",Former India head coach Ravi Shastri understands the significance of the intense rivalry between India and Pakistan in international cricket.

Joburg Super Kings ' winless streak at the Centurion in the SA20 continued on Wednesday when they lost by 32 runs to two-time defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape in Johannesburg. Their fifth consecutive loss at the picturesque ground, though, means they are now out of contention for the SA20 2025 final. Sunrisers, however, will have to go through Paarl Royals on Thursday in Qualifier 2. A win there and they will square off with MI Cape Town on Saturday for a chance at doing a staggering hat-trick.Put in to bat, SEC scored 184/6 in their allotted 20 overs with skipper Aiden Markram playing a captain's knock of an unbeaten 62 runs from 40 balls. In reply, JSK got going in patches but never enough to overhaul the target. Eventually, they were halted on 152/7 with Jonny Bairstow's 37 runs from 17 balls the biggest contribution.With the Gautrain running adjacent to Centurion, gunning at high speeds of 160-180 kmph, so were Markram, Tristan Stubbs (26 from 21) and Marco Jansen (23 from 12 balls). As they went gung ho, much of the brunt was felt by Lutho Sipamla who went for 0/72 in the four overs - the most expensive spell in SA20 history.The difference, eventually, came down to one over. Just six balls. That is where the game was largely won and lost.It was the 19th over of the SEC innings, the band was in full noise, crowd were enjoying their beers and families preparing for the grills. The 26-year-old Sipamla prepared to bowl the penultimate over.First ball, six. Full, sixth stump line, smashed beyond the sightscreen. Third ball, short, outside off, pulled into the grassbanks for six more. Next one, a no ball. Cherry on the cake at this stage. Fourth ball, freebie four with the fielder making a mess of it. Next, four more. Once again, width offered, low full toss, square drive four. Last ball, length ball, on the off stump, Jansen whips it for a maximum over deep mid-wicket.6, 1, 6, 2nb, 4, 4, 6 -- 29 runs from the over. SEC had suddenly gone from 146/5 to 175/5 before finishing on 184/6.During the chase, Devon Conway and Faf du Plessis tried to provide the launchpad with a 40-run partnership for the opening wicket. There were further stands for 22, 29, 25 and 24 but none that could circumvent the damage done by that over.Bairstow tried to replicate the mayhem with 21 runs from six balls at one point - hitting 6, 1, 4, 6, 4 - but his attempts were halted with a missed reverse sweep.As he walked back, annoyed with himself, SEC could breathe easy. They had taken a virtual step into the second qualifier at this very ground.",Sunrisers Eastern Cape beat Joburg Super Kings by 32 runs in SA20 qualifier. It was SEC's fifth consecutive loss at the picturesque ground. Aiden Markram top scored for SEC with 62 runs from 40 balls.

We played a lot of cricket here in Dubai. It was a pressure game, and I love pressure games. With the ball, I used the surface. I used my variations a lot,"" said Player of the Match, Gulbadin Naib.""It was a tough night. It was a great game of cricket; obviously, dew came on and made the game difficult for us. We were unfortunate not to have come out on top. I thought it was a great total, but it's T20 cricket .

'Nothing new': Rohit Sharma on his struggles ahead of England ODIs

What does Shubman Gill's horoscope say about his captaincy future

Rohit Sharma's batting in ODIs has been game changing: Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: ""India win the T20 World Cup after 17 years. The drought is over. Despair a thought for what Hardik Pandya has done i n the last half an hour"" — the passionate words of the former cricketer and ex-Team India head coach Ravi Shastri still resonate in the ears of Indian cricket fans. India clinched the T20 World Cup 2024 trophy after defeating South Africa in a thrilling final.India's star all-rounder, Hardik Pandya — who was one of the architects of India’s T20 World Cup triumph in Americas — spoke to the ICC in an interview, reflecting on the exhilarating final against South Africa and how he maintained his composure in the pressure-cooker atmosphere.Pandya also shared insights into his strategy for dismissing the dangerous South African batter Heinrich Klaasen ""There wasn't much spoken. Rohit and I have played together for so many years. He knows my character, my personality, and how much I value cricket awareness. Just before the ball, I told him that I was going to bowl wide to Klaasen. I just knew he would be expecting a delivery on the stumps. His stance was slightly leg-side dominant, so I anticipated he would try to hit me there,"" Pandya said.""Just before my run-up, right before I started, I looked at him and was about to say, 'I am going to bowl a slower one.' But I hadn’t set a field for a slower ball. I had to outfox him, to be one step ahead in the game so he wouldn’t anticipate the delivery. The way he was hitting was just tremendous. That moment, I think, opened the door for us.""I have always thrived in and enjoyed these high-pressure situations; they bring out the best in me. I have always visualized myself bowling the last over or scoring the winning run in a World Cup final.""In Barbados, there was a strong breeze blowing toward the dressing room side. If he wanted to drag me, he would have to hit against the wind, which increased the chances of a mistimed shot. My strength would have been a stump yorker, but we deliberately went outside off-stump for a specific reason—if he wanted to hit us, he had to do it against the odds, not in his favorable zone. That was pure situational awareness and understanding our strengths. I think that’s why we remained calm and composed with our plans.""Rohit and I spoke after the game as well. When the ball went up in the air, it initially looked like it would land inside the 30-yard circle or that a fielder would have to run in. But then we saw the wind carrying it farther and farther, and it just kept going—it didn’t stop.""And obviously, what Surya did in that moment, with such presence of mind and calmness, was sheer brilliance. We won as a team, but for me to play such a crucial role — it feels surreal. It’s a dream that actually came true.""It felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. The relief of the past six, seven, eight months just washed over me. I’m really, really proud of how I stood strong. Maybe I didn’t show much emotion, but everything I had been going through just came out in that moment. The pressure, the burden I had been carrying, just lifted, and I thought, ‘Yes… finally, I did it for my country,’"" Pandya explained.","India clinched the T20 World Cup 2024 trophy after defeating South Africa in a thrilling final.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

NEW DELHI: Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes the focus now shifts to Mohammed Shami as he returns from injury in India's ongoing limited-overs series against England. Shami, who last played for India, before the England series, in the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup final in November 2023, is seen as a crucial asset for the team ahead of the upcoming ICC Men's Champions Trophy ""My biggest concern about India when they came for Australia in the Test series was [Jasprit] Bumrah not having Shami there as a backup and him having to burden most of the load,"" Ponting said on The ICC Review.""And that's probably what happened, and might even have something to do with why he [Bumrah] got hurt. He probably ended up having to bowl a bit more in that series with Shami not being there.""So look, if Shami's fit, that's a positive.""Shami made his return in the third and fourth T20Is against England, putting up an impressive performance with figures of 3/25 in his latest outing.Former India head coach and cricketer Ravi Shastri emphasised the importance of managing Shami's workload in the upcoming ODI series against England.""It will be interesting to see if India play him out in all three, or they give him the first one and the third one, and then ease him into the Champions Trophy ,"" Shastri said.""But he'll be watched very closely because 10 overs is totally different to four overs, and then you're going to see how he pulls up in the field as well having bowled those 10 overs.""Shami's form and fitness will be crucial for India as they begin their ICC Men's Champions Trophy campaign against Bangladesh on February 20 in Dubai. With Bumrah already handling a significant workload, the return of a fully fit Shami could provide India with much-needed bowling depth and balance ahead of a crucial tournament.","Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes the focus now shifts to Mohammed Shami as he returns from injury.

NAGPUR: Always the talking point in cricket, Nagpur pitches haven’t been short of controversies. While the pitch was rated ‘poor’ by the ICC in 2015, the Test against Australia in 2023 also saw the visitors criticising the surface. For Thursday though, a fresh, hard surface has been rolled out for the first ODI between India and England.“It seems a 300+ wicket right now, with some help to the spinners in the second half. It looks grassy now, but it might be shaved off,” said a source from VCA.Indian vice-captain Shubman Gill reckoned the wicket will dry soon. “You can never really predict how the wicket is going to play. No instructions have been given by the Indian camp regarding the pitch. I haven't seen grass being shaved off the pitch. The wicket dries here soon, so they might have kept some grass so that the surface retains moisture,” he said while addressing the media.Only one Ranji Trophy match was played on the pitch between Vidarbha and Gujarat in November 2024.

NEW DELHI: Team India enters the final phase of their Champions Trophy preparations with the three-match ODI series against England starting on Thursday, as the team looks to address the form and fitness of key players. The focus is on finding the right balance in the lineup, particularly for certain positions. Captain Rohit Sharma and star batter Virat Kohli have been under intense scrutiny following their struggles in red-ball cricket.Both players, who had disappointing stints in the Ranji Trophy last month, are now aiming for strong performances in a format where they’ve long been dominant.

England 's premier batsman Joe Root is ready to mark his return to the ODIs and said coach Brendon McCullum has not specifically discussed his role but being the senior player he is aware what he is required to do.Root, who joined the squad after cutting short his stint with Paarl Royals in the SA20 tournament in South Africa, said that he is upbeat about his return to 50-over internationals for the first time since the 2023 World Cup.""I'm just looking forward to getting my teeth into it, to be honest. The more you play, the more experience you have, the more you've got to give as well, which is exciting when you're working with some of the talented young batters in the squad, sharing some experiences with them,"" said Root, ahead of the series-opening ODI against India in Nagpur, in a video posted by England and Wales Cricket Board on social media.The two teams will play three ODIs as part of warm-up for the ICC Champions Trophy, beginning February 19.Root said that head coach McCullum's cricket ideology aligns perfectly with the team's capabilities, opening up numerous opportunities for the side.""The way he (McCullum) looks at the game fits nicely with how the team sets up and the squad sets up, like the skill sets that we have, it's a really exciting mix. When you put that all together, the sky's the limit for this team, so, or this squad,"" he said.""There's a lot of special things that they are capable of. By playing together more and more and getting a further understanding of each other and buying into how we want to do things for a long period of time, I'm sure, we will see success at some point. It's a really exciting time to be involved in the white-ball team,"" Root added.""And hopefully that shows quite quickly out on the field.""",England's premier batsman Joe Root is ready to mark his return to the ODIs. Root joined the squad after cutting short his stint with Paarl Royals in the SA20 tournament in South Africa.

'Nothing new': Rohit Sharma on his struggles ahead of England ODIs

NEW DELHI: Former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar believes that a change in format and their past success in ODIs could help Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma rediscover their form in the upcoming series against England and the Champions Trophy Both senior batters have struggled in recent outings, including the home Test series against New Zealand and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, raising questions about their future in international cricket.Kohli, in particular, was dismissed eight times to deliveries outside the off-stump in Australia, while Rohit endured a torrid time, managing just 31 runs in five innings before opting out of the final Test in Sydney.""Both Virat and Rohit will go down as all-time great white-ball players. If you make a list, their names will certainly be there,"" Bangar, now Star Sports Network expert, said.""A change in format and their past performances in ODIs should give them confidence.""Bangar also expressed curiosity about Rohit’s approach at the top of the order.""It will be interesting to see how Rohit plays because he has had some low scores of late,"" he added.The duo’s struggles continued in their much-anticipated return to domestic cricket, making the England series and the Champions Trophy crucial opportunities for them to find form again.","Former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar believes that a change in format and past success in ODIs could help Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma rediscover their form.

'Nothing new': Rohit Sharma on his struggles ahead of England ODIs

Despite Rishabh Pant 's return to the ODI squad, KL Rahul will continue as India's wicketkeeper for the ODI series against England and likely for the Champions Trophy as well, India captain Rohit Sharma confirmed.Rahul took on wicketkeeping duties during India's 2023 World Cup campaign in Pant's absence while he was recovering from a car accident. Although Rahul performed well in the tournament, Pant made a successful comeback to the T20I squad for the 2024 T20 World Cup, which India won in Barbados.Rohit emphasised that Rahul has proven his worth in the ODI format and earned his place in the playing XI for the England series. He also noted that Pant’s return provides the team with flexibility in selection, calling it a ""good headache"" to have.""Look, obviously KL has been keeping wickets for us in the ODI format for a number of years now and he's done pretty well. You know, if you look at the last 10 or 15 ODIs, he's done exactly what the team required him to do.""Rishabh is well, you know, he's there. You know, we've got an option of playing either one of them. Both are quite capable of winning games on their own. So it's a good headache to have whether to play KL or Rishabh. But obviously looking at what we have done in the past, having that continuity is also very important for us. So that is where we stand as a team,"" said Rohit while addressing the press conference ahead of the first ODI against England in Nagpur.Rohit acknowledged that the team had limited ODI matches last year but affirmed their commitment to playing aggressive cricket.""There is a certain type of cricket that we want to play, certain brand of cricket we want to play and whether it means that we have to go and do what we did in the World Cup, we will try and do that.But again, the World Cup was one-and-a-half years back, you know. So clearly we need to regroup as a group now and think about what we need to do here. Obviously, there is a lot of experience in the squad so you can't keep telling them exactly how you need to prepare for every series. They understand what is expected of the team. So, there's not much talk about what kind of approach we want to have.These guys know exactly what is required of each one of us. So it's just about coming together now because it's been a while since we played this format. So, it's just about coming together and trying to do where we left off during the World Cup. If it takes a little bit of time. So we get, you know, it's not easy to start what we did in the World Cup. As I said, the World Cup was one-and-a-half years ago. So we need to try and think about what we need to do here now and start fresh,"" said Rohit.The India captain outlined the reasoning behind selecting leg-spinner Varun Chakravarthy in the ODI squad, despite already having Ravindra Jadeja , Kuldeep Yadav, and Axar Patel in the lineup.""He has certainly shown something different. I understand that it is in T20 format, but he's clearly got something different about him. So we just wanted to have an option and see what we can do with it. Clearly, during the series it presents us an opportunity to play him at some stage and see what he is capable of.When asked if the team management is considering Chakravarthy for the Champions Trophy, Rohit responded that while he isn't currently focusing on Chakravarthy for the squad, the leg-spinner is certainly in contention.""Right now we are not thinking about whether we're going to take him or not, but definitely he will be in contention. If things pan out really well for us and he does what is required, then definitely there is something that we need to think about,"" he added.India's captain refused to talk about who all are in the picture as replacements for a fast-bowling allrounder in case Hardik Pandya gets injured like he did in the 2023 World Cup. ""Why do you have negative thoughts,"" Rohit said. ""We should have positive thoughts.""Why do you want him to get injured? Let's all pray that every player is 100 per cent fit and remains fit,"" he added.",KL Rahul will continue as India's wicketkeeper for the ODI series against England and likely for the Champions Trophy as well. Rishabh Pant made a successful comeback to the T20I squad for the 2024 T20 World Cup in Barbados.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117953850,imgsize-137720,width-400,resizemode-4/117953850.jpg"

Rohit Sharma's batting in ODIs has been game changing: Shubman Gill

Squads

Australia: Steve Smith (capt), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey (wk), Cooper Connolly,

Travis Head

, Josh Inglis,

, Matt Kuhnemann, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Nathan McSweeney, Todd Murphy, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster.

Sri Lanka: Dhananjaya de Silva (capt), Dimuth Karunaratne, Oshada Fernando, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews, Kamindu Mendis, Kusal Mendis (wk), Sadeera Samarawickrama, Prabath Jayasuriya, Jeffrey Vandersay, Nishan Peiris, Asitha Fernando, Lahiru Kumara, Milan Rathnayake.

Australia remain on high alert for a spin challenge as they head into the second and final Test against Sri Lanka in Galle on Thursday, despite already securing the series. Steve Smith ’s men dominated the opening Test, claiming victory by an innings and 242 runs — the heaviest defeat Sri Lanka has ever suffered in Test cricket.That match, also played in Galle, featured a good batting surface, but conditions for the second Test appear drastically different.“This looks like a very dry surface. Dare say it's going to turn square,” Smith said on Wednesday.While Australia is yet to finalize its playing XI, Smith suggested that a decision would be made on the morning of the match based on conditions.With the Warne-Murali Trophy already in the bag and a spot in the World Test Championship final confirmed, Smith remains focused on completing a clean sweep.“I thought we played really well last week, controlling the game from the outset. We didn’t do that last time we were here, so it would be a great achievement to win 2-0,” he added.Following their humbling defeat, Sri Lanka are expected to make changes. Opener Pathum Nissanka returns after recovering from a groin injury and will replace Oshada Fernando.The bowling attack is also set for a shake-up, with off-spinner Ramesh Mendis likely to replace Nishan Peiris, who endured a tough outing in the first Test, conceding 189 runs in 41 wicketless overs.“Pathum has been declared fit and he will play. But we haven’t finalized our bowling combination yet,” Sri Lanka captain Dhananjaya de Silva said.De Silva acknowledged his team’s batting struggles in the first Test and emphasized the need for improvement.“It wasn’t the typical Galle wicket last time around. It was a disappointing Test because we should have batted much better,” he admitted.“Too many guys got starts but failed to kick on. We know where things went wrong, and we’re looking to correct those mistakes.”A Farewell for KarunaratneThe Test will also mark a significant moment for Sri Lankan cricket as veteran opener Dimuth Karunaratne prepares to retire after his 100th Test appearance.“Dimuth has been a fabulous leader and an exceptional player,” de Silva said. “He has done amazing things for the team and, without a doubt, ranks as the best opening batter Sri Lanka has ever produced. We want to give him a fitting farewell.”With Australia eyeing a series sweep and Sri Lanka determined to bounce back, the final Test in Galle promises to be a gripping contest.",Australia face Sri Lanka in the second and final Test in Galle on Thursday. Steve Smith's men won the first Test by an innings and 242 runs. Sri Lanka suffered the heaviest defeat in Test cricket history in the first match. The hosts are expected to make changes to their side for the second Test.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117953235,imgsize-27702,width-400,resizemode-4/117953235.jpg"

England playing XI

:

Former England captain Joe Root will make his return to the ODI format for the first time since the 2023 World Cup when the visitors take field in the first match of the series against India in Nagpur on Thursday.Root's return to the squad aims to strengthen England's middle-order batting, particularly in conditions favouring spin, as the team prepares for the ICC Champions Trophy that commences on February 19.""Very excited, it’s great being back involved. It's obviously been a while so to be around the group, play with a few lads who I have not seen in a while is very exciting and of course what a great venue to get back to,"" Root said in a video posted by England Cricket .The England squad, led by Jos Buttler, enters this series following a disappointing 1-4 loss in the T20I series. The white-ball tour is also the first for coach Brendon McCullum since he was promoted to be the team's all-format coach.""We have had Baz (McCullum) for quite a while now in the Test team and you know what he’s going to bring. The way he looks at the game fits nicely with how the team sets up, the skillsets we have, I think it's a really exciting mix and when you put all of them together, the sky's the limit for this team,"" said Root.Root enters the ODI squad following a successful run with Paarl Royals in the SA20 tournament in South Africa. He scored 279 runs in the tournament, including two fifties, and also claimed five wickets with his off-spin bowling.“It’s pretty obvious, being the most senior batter in the team, I'm just looking forward to getting my teeth into it to be honest. The more you play, the more experience you have, the more you’ve got to give as well which is exciting when you’re working with such talented young batters in the squad. Watching their journey, being a part of it as well, I am looking forward to it,"" Root added.Phil Salt (wk), Ben Duckett, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jos Buttler (c), Liam Livingstone, Jacob Bethell, Byrdon Carse, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Saqib Mahmood","Former England captain Joe Root will make his return to the ODI format for the first time since the 2023 World Cup.

MUMBAI: Forced to change its travel plans at the eleventh hour, the Mumbai team, which includes India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav and India allrounder Shivam Dube , will land in Kolkata on Wednesday evening, after the BCCI decided to switch the venue of Mumbai's Ranji Trophy quarter-final against Haryana, scheduled to start from Saturday, at the last minute.""We had made all the preparations to take the team to Lahli like providing woollen sweaters to the players, however, the BCCI shifted the game at the last moment - we received an email at 11.30pm last night informing us of the venue switch-due to 'unavoidable circumstances.' We quickly informed the players as the Mumbai team was supposed to fly out on Wednesday morning to Delhi. However, after we cancelled the Delhi tickets and scrambled for fresh tickets for Kolkata, they then took a 5.30pm flight to Kolkata, as the game will now be played at the Eden Gardens,"" MCA secretary Abhay Hadap told TOI.According to sources, the BCCI shifted the match to Kolkata as the Lahli pitch couldn't be prepared in time due to the harsh weather in Northern India at this point in time. There 's surely relief in the Mumbai camp that the knockout match has been shifted to Kolkata. ""A match in Lahli, even though its spread over five days, could have been severely disrupted by bad weather. A curtailed, incomplete match could've seen Haryana advancing to the semifinals, since they have more points in the league stage compared to Mumbai. Last season, the Mumbai Under-23 team had been knocked out after their match at Lahli was curtailed, with Haryana going through,"" a source in the MCA said.Keeping in mind that the match was originally in Lahli, Mumbai had picked an 18-man squad as a ""precautionary measure,"" just in case someone fell ill due to the extreme cold in Northern India at the moment.The Haryana team too reached Kolkata on Wednesday evening.",Mumbai's Ranji Trophy quarter-final against Haryana will now be played in Kolkata.

WPL will play big role in India's preparations for ODI World Cup: Harmanpreet Kaur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/wpl/wpl-will-play-big-role-in-indias-preparations-for-odi-world-cup-harmanpreet-kaur/articleshow/117950448.cms,"(PTI photo)

MUMBAI: The jury is still out on whether the advent of the Women's Premier League has helped in the improvement of the performance of the Indian women's cricket team. Post the inaugural edition of the WPL in March 2023, in Dec-January 23-24, India lost both the white-ball series to England and Australia. In October last year, India crashed out in the league stage of the Champions Trophy.At a time when the third edition of the WPL beckons-it will start from March 14- India and Mumbai Indians’ captain Harmanpreet Kaur stated at the Mumbai Indians’ pre-season press conference here on Wednesday that WPL-2025, set to kick off from Feb 14 with the first leg in Vadodara, will play a big role in preparation for the ODI World Cup which India are hosting later this year.“This WPL is going to play a very big role because this year we have ODI World Cup. After the WPL, we have a very good window where we can work on our fitness,” Harmanpreet said, while also lauding the India U-19 women’s team for ""setting a new benchmark"" with their second consecutive T20 World Cup title win in Malaysia recently.“Our U-19 team is setting a benchmark with back-to-back trophies and it’s a very proud moment for all of us,” the Indian women’s team captain said.Interestingly, Harmanpreet, MI’s head coach Charlotte Edwards, the team’s mentor and bowling coach Jhulan Goswami and all-rounder S Sajana, all arrived for the team’s pre-season presser in a local Mumbai taxi, driven by a woman taxi driver!Jhulan said that her side has a “quality core team,” which includes Tamil Nadu's 16-year-old 'keeper-bat G Kamalini, who was acquired by MI at the 2024 player mini-auction for ?1.6 crore. In the U-19 Women's World Cup, she scored 143 runs, with two half-centuries, and a top score of 56 not out in the semifinals against England.“All of them are very quality (players), they have done very well in domestic cricket and they have performed really well. One of them has just now won the U-19 (T20) World Cup, G Kamalini... (and there is) Sanskriti Gupta too. We have a quality core team; we have a few youngsters who have picked it up this season.,” the Indian fast bowling legend said.Edwards said the team will continue to monitor India seamer Pooja Vastrakar, who is currently injured. “Pooja is injured at the moment so we will be making a call on that very, very soon. Clearly, she has been a big player for us for the last couple of seasons but we are monitoring her fitness and hopefully we should be able to announce something really soon.”Jhulan said that the WPL had changed the mindset of the Indian players, who were now, looking to impress the league's talent scouts.“Most importantly, if you go to domestic cricket, you will see their (players’) mindset, their approach towards the game, it was not there earlier. You will see they (now) want to come and play a good brand of cricket, try to impress those scout people to get a chance to play in WPL. It’s (has had) a huge impact. People recognise all those cricketers who have done well in the last three (two) years in WPL. If you go to different parts — I travel with the Bengal team and I know — where we never used to get that recognition, now people (have) started to follow, they understand the game, they want to know when the next WPL is, when the next auction is,” she added.While the inaugural edition of the WPL was held entirely in Mumbai, the third edition will be held in four venues — Vadodara, Bengaluru, Lucknow and Mumbai.Having scored her maiden international century in Mumbai, Harmanpreet has a special relationship with the ‘Maximum City.’ “Mumbai mein time ki bahut value hai (Time is of utmost value in Mumbai),” she said, before going on.“One thing which I learnt when I was living here and working for Railways was people don’t like to waste their time. Cricket-wise as well, a lot of my good performances have happened in Mumbai. And then being picked by MI, it couldn’t have been better. I have won a lot of trophies in Mumbai, really happy that we are getting a chance to play in front of our fans. We really missed them last year.”""The best thing about WPL is going to different places in our country and it will impact local young girls, motivate them, encourage them and that is the ultimate motive of WPL,” Jhulan said.","WPL-2025, set to kick off from Feb 14 with the first leg in Vadodara.

KOLKATA: Jamshedpur FC coach Khalid Jamil achieved an Indian Super League first 'double' over the weekend, when he became the first head coach — and also, the first Indian — to score a league double over Manolo Marquez , the FC Goa and current India coach. On Sunday, Jamil's Jamshedpur beat the Goans 3-1. In their away fixture in September last year, Khalid's men had won 2-1, their first game of the season.""All the credit goes to the players. They are working very hard and are motivated. They knew that the game was important and I just told them to give their best and play their natural game,"" Jamil told the broadcasters' post-match interview afterwards.Jamil corners a fair share of the credit as well. This is not the first time that he has been successful in ISL. In the 2020-21 season, he guided North East United FC to the playoffs — also a first by an Indian coach. This time, Jamshedpur have reached the second spot since they won the Shield under Owen Coyle in 2021-22. Furthermore, at home this season they have been unbeaten in nine of their ten games.On what this meant for the Indian coaches in the ISL, former India player and Bengaluru FC assistant coach Renedy Singh said, ""I'm happy that his season is going well, but it hasn't finished yet. Jamil should just continue and I'm sure a lot of Indian coaches will be hoping that he succeeds so that the others can follow.""That Khalid completely outsmarted his counterpart on Sunday, was quite evident from what Manolo said after the match. ""We didn't know how to play against them,"" conceded Manolo, ""In the first half if the score was 4-0 for them, it was fair. We started okay in the second, but when they scored their second ...

NEW DELHI: Football legend Cristiano Ronaldo has always thrived under pressure, and his love for the big stage was evident when he spoke about playing at FC Barcelona ’s legendary Camp Nou .“I loved playing in the Camp Nou,” Ronaldo told El Chiringuito TV . “They booed me, they insulted me, and I loved it!”Ronaldo's battles against Barcelona remain some of the most iconic moments in football history.During his time at Real Madrid , he clashed with Barça in numerous heated encounters, often facing jeers from the passionate Catalan crowd.Yet, those insults only seemed to fuel his fire, making his performances even more electrifying.Whether scoring in El Clásico or silencing the crowd with his trademark celebrations, Ronaldo always embraced the challenge of playing in enemy territory.Even at 39, Ronaldo continues to dominate. On Monday, he led Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr to a 4-0 victory over Al-Wasl in the AFC Champions League Elite, netting twice to take his season tally to 23 goals.His first goal came from the penalty spot just before halftime, and he added another with a precise header 12 minutes from time.

NEW DELHI: In a captivating encounter at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea overturned a deficit to secure a 2-1 victory against West Ham in the Premier League 's latest London derby.This triumph, marking only their second in eight matches, propelled Chelsea into the fourth position in the league standings, positioning them two points clear of Manchester City and trailing Nottingham Forest by four points. Meanwhile, West Ham's challenges persist as they stay in 15th place.The match saw the return of England forward Jarrod Bowen for West Ham after a six-game absence due to a foot injury.Bowen made a significant impact, putting West Ham ahead shortly before the half-time break.The opportunity arose from a misjudged back pass by Levi Colwill, which Bowen capitalized on with a precise left-footed shot that found the net, beating Chelsea's goalkeeper Filip Jørgensen.Jørgensen was in the lineup in place of Robert Sanchez, who was sidelined due to a dip in form.Chelsea's response came in the 64th minute, amidst a period when West Ham appeared to be gaining the upper hand. Enzo Fernandez's attempt was initially thwarted on the goal line, but Pedro Neto, coming on as a substitute, managed to score on the rebound.The goal stood following a prolonged review and despite protests from West Ham players who alleged a foul on Bowen during the lead-up to the goal.The decisive moment for Chelsea came with 16 minutes remaining when Cole Palmer's attempt from a challenging angle was inadvertently deflected into West Ham's net by defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka, tilting the outcome in Chelsea's favour.Post-match, Jarrod Bowen expressed disappointment, highlighting the effort put forth by West Ham.""Just disappointed to be leading and lose the game,"" Bowen said. ""We left everything out there. We came to a side who are pushing for top four, pushing for the title. On another day, I think it could have been a different result.""The match also marked a less-than-favourable return for Graham Potter, the recently appointed West Ham coach, to Stamford Bridge.Potter, who was dismissed from his role at Chelsea in April 2023 after a tenure of less than seven months, experienced defeat in his first game against his former club since his departure.","Chelsea beat West Ham 2-1 in the Premier League's latest London derby.

NEW DELHI: The January transfer window witnessed significant activity from several top clubs as they sought to bolster their squads for the remainder of the season and beyond.Manchester City, the four-time defending Premier League champions, made a late splash by securing the services of Porto midfielder Nico Gonzalez for a reported fee of $60 million.This move was aimed at addressing the void left by the long-term injury to their defensive midfield lynchpin, Rodri.Aston Villa, currently competing in the Champions League , also made notable additions to their attacking ranks. They secured the loan signing of Marco Asensio from Real Madrid until the end of the season, adding Champions League-winning experience to their squad.Additionally, Villa acquired Marcus Rashford on loan from Manchester United, a player who had fallen out of favour but possesses immense potential to contribute to their European and domestic campaigns.Elsewhere, the uncertainty surrounding Bayern Munich forward Mathys Tel was resolved as he completed a loan move to Tottenham Hotspur, with the option of a permanent deal in the summer.Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) were one of the busiest clubs during the window, signing Khvicha Kvaratskhelia from Napoli for a reported $72 million, while also offloading several players, including Randal Kolo Muani, Milan Skriniar, and Asensio.Manchester City's spending spree, which exceeded $200 million, was a bid to salvage a campaign that had unravelled towards the end of the previous year and was further derailed by a 5-1 loss to Arsenal.In addition to Gonzalez, City acquired Egypt forward Omar Marmoush, defenders Abdukodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis, and young left-back Christian McFarlane from their sister club, New York City FC.PSG's acquisition of Kvaratskhelia represents a return to their previous strategy of marquee signings, albeit with a focus on younger talents rather than established superstars.This move comes after the departures of high-profile players like Lionel Messi, Neymar, and Kylian Mbappé in recent years.The Saudi Arabian league also made headlines, with Jhon Duran joining Al-Nassr from Aston Villa for a reported $80 million.However, the highly anticipated move of Neymar to Al-Hilal was cut short, as the Brazilian's contract was terminated, and he returned to his boyhood club, Santos.In the women's game, significant deals were also made, with US defender Naomi Girma becoming the first million-dollar player in the women's game as she moved from the San Diego Wave to Chelsea.The Blues also spent heavily to bring England midfielder Keira Walsh back to the Women's Super League from Barcelona.","The January transfer window witnessed significant activity from several top clubs.

'I felt disrespected': Jenni Hermoso speaks out in court on former prez Luis Rubiales's World Cup kiss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/i-felt-disrespected-jenni-hermoso-speaks-out-in-court-on-former-prez-luis-rubialess-world-cup-kiss/articleshow/117899926.cms,"The controversial World Cup moment involving Jenni Hermoso and Luis Rubiales (Reuters Photo)

NEW DELHI: Spanish women's national team forward Jenni Hermoso testified on Monday at the trial of Luis Rubiales , the former president of the Spanish Football Federation .The trial revolves around an incident that occurred during the 2023 Women's World Cup final presentation ceremony, where Rubiales kissed Hermoso without her consent.In her testimony, Hermoso stated that she did not consent to the kiss and felt disrespected by Rubiales's actions. “I felt disrespected,” Hermoso said. It ""stained one of the happiest days of my life.”She also revealed that she felt coerced to publicly exonerate Rubiales after the incident, but she refused to do so.Rubiales, who was present in the Madrid High Court, is facing charges of sexual assault and attempting to coerce Hermoso and others to publicly support him. He has denied the charges, claiming that the kiss was consensual and occurred in a ""moment of jubilation"".However, Hermoso firmly stated that Rubiales did not ask for her consent before kissing her.The incident sparked outrage in Spain and beyond, highlighting the prevalence of sexism in sports and society. Facing immense pressure, Rubiales resigned three weeks after the incident and was banned by FIFA for three years. He had previously claimed to be the victim of a ""witch hunt"" by ""false feminists"".Prosecutors, Hermoso, and the Spain players' association are seeking a prison sentence of two and a half years for Rubiales, a payment of 50,000 euros ($51,800) for damages, and a ban from working as a sports official.Hermoso celebrated the World Cup victory with her teammates after the kiss, but she clarified that she chose to celebrate the trophy win like any footballer would, as it was an important moment for her.The trial is expected to last at least 10 days, with nearly 20 witnesses expected to testify, including Spain's men's national coach Luis de la Fuente and some of Hermoso's teammates, such as former world player of the year Alexia Putellas.In addition to Rubiales, former Spain women's national coach Jorge Vilda, former sports director of the Spain men's team Albert Luque, and the federation's former head of marketing, Rubén Rivera, are also on trial. They are accused of allegedly pressuring Hermoso to defend Rubiales publicly in a statement after the incident, which she refused to do.Hermoso expressed that her life was put on standby after the incident and the ensuing controversy, and she was able to escape the spotlight by playing for a club in Mexico. The incident overshadowed Spain's first Women's World Cup triumph and triggered protests and widespread condemnation.","Spanish women's national team forward Jenni Hermoso testified on Monday at the trial of Luis Rubiales.

Five-star Arsenal crush woeful Manchester City to keep title bid alive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/five-star-arsenal-crush-woeful-manchester-city-to-keep-title-bid-alive/articleshow/117872856.cms,"NEW DELHI: With a 5-1 thumping of a miserable Manchester City on Sunday, Arsenal maintained their hopes of winning the Premier League title, while the struggling champions suffered yet another setback in their terrible season.Following Liverpool's 2-0 victory over Bournemouth on Saturday, which put them nine points ahead of the Gunners, Mikel Arteta 's team had no room for mistake in the title fight.After 103 seconds at the Emirates Stadium, Martin Odegaard's first goal emboldened them to go on a spectacular display.Shortly after halftime, Erling Haaland scored his 25th goal of the season across all competitions to tie the score for City.However, when Thomas Partey took advantage of Phil Foden's shoddy pass to put Arsenal back ahead, the thoughtless errors that have plagued City over a lackluster season proved to be the difference.Kai Havertz and Ethan Nwaneri's late goals and Myles Lewis-Skelly's debut goal for Arsenal completed a brilliant performance that saw the Gunners get within six points of Liverpool.Although Arsenal's strong performance increased their undefeated streak to 14 games and demonstrated their desire to fight the Reds to the end, Liverpool's game in hand maintains them comfortably in charge of the title race.City's six-game winning streak in the top tier came to a cruel end, and they have now lost all four of their league encounters with Arsenal.After their miserable season, City's hopes of winning a fifth straight crown were long since dashed, and now Pep Guardiola's fourth-place team is concentrating on making it to the Champions League However, unless Guardiola can address the glaring gaps in his defense and the lack of energy in his midfield, even that might be beyond them, let alone defeating Real Madrid in this season's playoff round.Abdukodir Khusanov, a former Lens defender who made a clumsy start against Chelsea last weekend, was replaced by John Stones by Guardiola.Stones, however, was a part of the disastrous defense that gave Arsenal the lead in the second minute.Stones put his fellow defender in a tight spot with a pass to the marked Manuel Akanji.Leandro Trossard robbed Akanji right away, and with City's defense in disarray, Kai Havertz picked out Odegaard, who then slotted home from ten yards out.Guardiola marched thunderously back to the bench, already fearing the worst.The frustrated Guardiola made a variety of furious gestures as a result of City controlling possession but being toothless for extended periods of time.During the tempestuous 2-2 draw earlier this season, Haaland infuriated Arsenal by instructing Arteta to ""stay humble"" and hurling the ball at Gunners defender Gabriel Magalhaes.Unsurprisingly, Haaland scored City's equalizer in the 55th minute.Haaland had the opportunity to sneak in front of William Saliba and bury his close-range header after Savinho's excellently weighted cross.However, it only took Arsenal two minutes to make Haaland stop smiling.After Partey intercepted Foden's pass, the Ghanaian midfielder launched a strong long-range shot that struck Stones with a deft deflection.In the 62nd minute, Lewis-Skelly went for the kill as Arsenal smelt blood.The 18-year-old left-back cut inside the City area and curled a beautiful finish into the far corner with elegance that belied his inexperience.Lewis-Skelly mimicked the City star's contemplative celebration by sitting down with his legs crossed to mark the goal in a playful jab at Haaland.The much-maligned Havertz scored in the 76th minute, adding to the suffering of shell-shocked City.After stomping through City's flimsy defense, Gabriel Martinelli set up Havertz for a clinical 10-yard finish.Nwaneri, a young forward, struck the final punch deep into stoppage time with a brilliant goal into the far corner from a sharp angle.For the second time in a humiliating day, City had no answer to the taunts of ""you're getting sacked in the morning"" from Arsenal supporters directed at Guardiola.","Arsenal maintained their hopes of winning the Premier League title with a 5-1 thumping of a miserable Manchester City.

MUMBAI: It didn't seem like Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi had done much wrong. She had just completed a 6-4, 6-1 over Belarusian Iryna Shymanovich, finishing the match exactly how she had started it, with an ace. It was not just her first round match of the L&T Mumbai Open , this was her WTA main draw debut, and for most part, the 15-year-old looked to have ticked a lot of the right boxes judging by the applause she drew from the Cricket Club of India crowd here on Tuesday.And yet, the promising teenager wasn't totally pleased with her performance while reflecting on it later. “Well, one thing is that I think I played my qualifying rounds better than today. So one thing that I'm happy about is that I managed to win even though I didn't play my best today,” Maaya would say.Winning despite not being at your best! That's a trait that the man whose famous academy Maaya currently trains at often fell back on over the course of his storied career. For now, she is still in the early days of her one-year stint at the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca, and apart from saying “it's going good” and mentioning a “small conversation” she had with Toni, Rafa's uncle and long-time coach, there's not much else Maaya can share just yet.Her racket, however, did the talking against the 225th-ranked Shymanovich, who, Maaya happened to learn would be her opponent “just five minutes” before she was to step on court.As she and Shymanovich were hitting to each other in the warm-up, a livescoring app still showed Yuriko Miyazaki of Great Britain as Maaya's opponent. Miyazaki was forced to withdraw due to illness.Did the late twist throw Maaya off in any way? “Nah, because either way, I didn't know anything about my previous opponent. The same applies to this (player),” the Coimbatore girl grinned.There was notable support for Maaya in the crowd as Grand Slam doubles champion Rohan Bopanna followed the youngster's progress over the first set. “I'm really honoured to have him here because I think he flew down to watch this match and I'm really happy that he was here,” she said.Tuesday's win coupled with her two victories in the qualifiers have earned Maaya 21 WTA ranking points, taking her total points tally to 24 and earning her an entry into the WTA rankings.She will take on Zarina Diyas in the second round, after the Kazakh eliminated defending champion Darja Semenistaja 6-3, 6-3.Meanwhile, Ankita Raina and Shrivalli Bhamidipaty were the other Indian players to advance to the last 16 stage on Tuesday. Raina proved too strong for compatriot Vaishnavi Adkar, coming through 6-2, 6-2, while Bhamidipaty produced a devastating display to take out the 182nd-ranked Elena Pridankina of Russia 6-1, 6-0 in just 64 minutes.","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi beat Belarusian Iryna Shymanovich 6-4, 6-1.

NEW DELHI: Indian tennis player Sumit Nagal secured his place in the pre-quarterfinals following a resilient victory against Argentina's Renzo Olivo in a notable advancement at the 2025 Rosario Challenger .The match concluded with scores of 5-7, 6-1, 6-0 in favour of Nagal, who is the eighth seed in the tournament. This victory marks a significant achievement for the 27-year-old Indian, displaying his ability to recover and dominate after an initial setback.Nagal's next opponent will be determined by the outcome of the match between Tseng Chun-hsin from Chinese Taipei and Bolivia's Hugo Dellien .This triumph comes at a crucial time for Nagal, who recently experienced a decline in his professional standing.Prior to this event, he had fallen out of the ATP top-100 rankings, a position he had maintained for 10 consecutive months since March 2024.This drop was attributed to a series of disappointing performances, with Nagal securing only three main draw victories in 18 tournaments since Wimbledon 2024.Despite this, his earlier entry into the top-100 in February 2024, following a commendable performance at a Grand Slam event, underscores his potential and skill on the international stage.In related developments within Indian tennis, veteran doubles player Rohan Bopanna , aged 44, has also experienced a setback, falling five places to No. 21 in the rankings.This decline followed an early exit from the Australian Open, where he was unable to defend the points from his previous championship win.Bopanna's attempt to retain his standing, alongside new partner Nicolas Barrientos, ended prematurely in the opening round of the competition.Other Indian players, including Sasikumar Mukund, Ramkumar Ramanathan, Karan Singh, and Aryan Shah, maintain their positions within the top-600 in singles rankings.In doubles, alongside Bopanna, players such as Yuki Bhambri, N Sriram Balaji, Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli, and Arjun Kadhe are within the top-100.","Indian tennis player Sumit Nagal secured his place in the pre-quarterfinals following a resilient victory against Argentina's Renzo Olivo.

The player defended his stand in a lengthy post on social media, saying ""it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country"".Amritraj , who worked with Nagal when he held the role of captain a few years ago, described the idea as ""inconceivable"".""To me personally, it is just inconceivable that if you are ranked high enough and the country wants you to play, that you would play without any financial compensation,"" Amritraj told reporters here on the sidelines of the L&T Mumbai Open at the Cricket Club of India on Monday.""Unless you are injured and you can't walk on the court, other than that, there should be no question that you're going to play Davis Cup. Same for me, same for Vijay,"" he added, referring to his brother with whom he helped India reach the 1974 Davis Cup finals against South Africa.""Both of us felt that it is the greatest honour that you can have to play for your country. Maybe this is old-school thinking, but that is absolutely how it should be.""You got 50 weeks in the year to make money, two weeks of the year, you should be able to give to places you grew up in, and it should be an honour and a privilege.""On Nagal's case, the 73-yearold said: ""I like Sumit, when I was captain he was the reserve on my team five years ago. I got along very well with him, but he didn't play the last tie (vs Sweden in Sept) either, which is really a shame because he is our best player right now.""Asked if there should be strong repercussions for players who choose to not turn up for national team duties, Amritraj said it was a tricky situation as players could always lean on the ""independence of the ATP Tour "" to make their decisions.With some Indian players, however, enjoying government funding through programmes like the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), it could be a way for Aita to crack the whip, Amritraj felt.""That's where you should put the screws on them. I think you should definitely do that. If you're in any kind of place with some leverage, you should say: 'Either you play Davis Cup, or you won't get this'. Simple.""","Top-ranked players Sumit Nagal and Yuki Bhambri turned down chance to represent India.

CHENNAI: Indian tennis is not going through the best of times. While its top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has made good strides in recent years, the rest of the crop has struggled in the journey to the top.The player distribution in the Chennai Open Challenger best explains the current scenario. Even in a home tournament, India, in the absence of Nagal, is forced to rely on wildcards for main-draw singles entries as the next-best players from the country find it difficult to directly make the cut. Davis Cuppers Mukund Sasikumar (ranked 365), Ramkumar Ramanathan (406) and Karan Singh will have a point to prove after being awarded wildcards by the organisers.The onus will be on the experienced Ramkumar and Mukund to gain valuable points to move up in the rankings chart. The 28-year-old Mukund had a good run in Chennai last year, reaching the quarterfinals, but could not carry forward the momentum in the tournaments that followed. Ramkumar’s story in the past few years has not been much different, with the 30-year-old’s inconsistency hampering his chances to move to a higher level. Youngster Karan has shown promise in the early stages of his career and is steadily rising up the ladder.Moving to foreign interest, quite a few players are looking to resurrect their careers and compete in the Grand Slams. For instance, Lloyd Harris, who is the second seed in singles, was once ranked as high as 31 and reached the quarterfinals of the US Open in 2021. Injury issues forced the South African to stay away from action for quite a long period and the 27-year-old will compete in his first match since the Wimbledon last year.Former world No. 35 Jiri Vesely had to sit out in 2023 due to injury concerns. The 31-year-old had won the ATP 250 title in Pune in 2020 and had a good time in India in the past. Ahead of the Chennai Open, Vesely said: “Preparations have been good and I am getting used to the weather, but it is not easy. It is always nice to be in India and people are very friendly and supportive. I love coming back here and I hope to have a good run on this trip.”Vesely dropped outside the top-600 a few years ago and since then, he has found it tough to be back to his best. “I wish to move up and it is not easy. A lot of youngsters are playing well and I need to compete with them and give my best.”","India's top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has made good strides in recent years.

CHENNAI: Italian tennis player Jacopo Berrettini does not have to look far for inspiration. The 26-year-old shares a strong bond with his elder brother Matteo Berrettini , a former top-10 singles player and 2021 Wimbledon finalist, whom he regards not only his best friend but also his idol.“I have a good relationship with him. He is a very good human, and I am so glad and lucky to have him. Apart from on-court training, he mentors me off the field and is a good coach. We shared the same (coaching) team for the past three years and now share the same trainer. Before coming here, we trained together for three days in Rome,” Jacopo, who will begin his season at the Chennai Open Challenger , told TOI on Saturday.Jacopo and Matteo had a tough 2023 as their seasons were marred by injuries. Matteo had to take a six-month break, while Jacopo had to miss the majority of the year. In that period, the Berrettini brothers helped each other stay mentally strong. “It was a very tough period for us, for our family. We were trying to be the humans that we are, trying to stay mentally focused and healthy. We had to work a lot after recovery because this sport is so tough mentally and physically. We were trying to enjoy life outside the sport as it is very important as well. After suffering from a lot of injuries, Matteo had a good season last year,” Jacopo added.While Jacopo and Matteo do not spend much time together due to their playing commitments, they are always in touch. “We try to talk often and as much as we can. Sometimes, we train together, but if we are not able to spend a lot of time, it is okay since we travel and play regularly. We are healthy and that is a good thing for us.”‘Aim to carry forward momentum’: Jacopo had a productive season last year and achieved his career-best singles ranking of 317. The Italian will look to carry forward the momentum, starting with his season opener in Chennai. “It was a good year (2024) for me, playing many matches without any injury concerns. I worked on many aspects and will try to keep going. My goal for this year is to compete in the qualifiers of the Grand Slams, for which I have to get close to the 230 mark (rankings).”",Italian tennis player Jacopo Berrettini shares a strong bond with his elder brother Matteo.

The hosts, who had taken a commanding 2-0 lead by winning the first two singles on the opening day of the tie on Saturday, completed the formality with two dominant wins - in doubles and singles - on Sunday. The fifth rubber was not played. The World Group 1 tie would be played in September later this year and the name of their opponents would be announced later.The doubles pair of Sriram Balaji and Davis Cup debutant Rithvik Bollipalli put the hosts ahead in the fourth game when they broke M'lapa Akomlo, the substitute for regular player Thomas Setodji who pulled out with an injury. Akomlo proved to be the weak link as the Indians, playing some smart tennis with clever ball placement and strong net presence, broke his service to take the set 6-2. The second set was even shorter as the Indians broke Akomlo and his partner Isak Padio once each to claim the set 6-1. The match lasted 57 minutes.With the tie secured, India gave rookie Karan Singh his Davis Cup debut in the dead rubber and the 21-year-old did not disappoint as he beat Isak, whom Togo fielded in place of original choice Setodji. The 20-year-old in fact put up the best show by a Togolese player on the trip as he stretched most of the games. He even managed to break Singh once in the second set as India won the match 6-2, 6-3 - the first instance when Togo won three games in a set on this tour.""I started playing tennis when I was an 11-year-old and I had no idea how far I would go. I just kept going day by day. And here we are today. And I really enjoyed playing the match today. All the teammates were really cheering me,"" Karan later said.The other Davis Cup debutant Bollipalli shared his thoughts: ""Playing in Davis Cup is a different feeling. It's a little bit different from the regular matches that we play.""'Grooming future captain'Interestingly, once India won the doubles match and the Playoff, regular captain Rohit Rajpal took a backseat and allowed Mukund Sasikumar occupy the captain's chair during the fourth rubber, played by Karan Singh. The captain's chairs are placed next to the chair umpire so that the players could consult with the captains during game breaks. ""I always do that. Sometimes it's as important as grooming players. Sitting on that chair has a different kind of pressure you need that experience. It's good for them. They'll be the future captains.

Balaji's serving was exceptional, losing only one point on his serve during the entire contest.The Indians gained their first break when Akomolo served in the third game, and from there, it was a one-sided affair. Bollipalli, making his debut, overcame initial nerves and settled into the match, contributing significantly to the victory.The pair's experience of winning a Challenger together last year proved advantageous, as they displayed a straightforward and efficient performance. India is likely to give young Karan Singh a debut in the dead rubber match.Balaji and Bollipalli's convincing straight-set victory sealed India's place in the Davis Cup World Group I, showcasing their dominance and leaving Togo with little chance for a comeback.","N Sriram Balaji and Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli secured India's place in the Davis Cup World Group I with a commanding straight-set victory.

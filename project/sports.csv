India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur under pressure ahead of ICC Women's ODI World Cup 2025?

Bengaluru’s loss could become Thiruvananthapuram ’s gain, with the Greenfield Stadium in Karyavattom now likely to host some matches in the upcoming Women’s World Cup (scheduled from September 30 to November 2). Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) president K Jayesh confirmed to TOI that discussions with the International Cricket Council (ICC) are ongoing.The M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru was awarded four matches — including the final, provided Pakistan did not qualify — when the ICC announced the official tournament itinerary. However, a tragic turn of events has put those plans on hold. A deadly stampede outside the Chinnaswamy Stadium on June 4, during the Royal Challengers Bangalore’s IPL victory celebrations, claimed 11 lives. In the aftermath, the Karnataka government reportedly withdrew permission to host any matches at the venue.The state government’s decision followed the findings of a government-commissioned probe led by Justice John Michael D’Cunha. The commission declared the stadium “fundamentally unsafe” for large-scale events. The fallout has already affected other events. The Chinnaswamy Stadium was recently denied permission to host the KSCA Maharaja T20 Trophy, which has now been shifted to Mysuru’s Srikantadatta Narasimha Raja Wadeyar ground.In light of these developments, ICC chairman Jay Shah met with KCA president Jayesh in Mumbai earlier this week and posed a pivotal question: “Are you ready to take over as the host?”“We assured him that Thiruvananthapuram is ready to host the Women’s World Cup matches. We have the necessary infrastructure in place,” Jayesh said. While an official confirmation from the ICC is still pending, the KCA remains optimistic. “It’s not yet confirmed how many matches we will host. We are waiting for the ICC’s nod and several logistical challenges still need to be addressed,” Jayesh added.","Greenfield Stadium in Karyavattom likely to host some matches in the upcoming Women’s World Cup (scheduled from September 30 to November 2) Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) president K Jayesh confirmed to TOI that discussions with the International Cricket Council (ICC) are ongoing.

Poll Should India boycott Pakistan in the upcoming Asia Cup? Yes, for the sake of national integrity No, sports should be separate from politics Only if the government decides Unsure

""Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte. Hum unko itni importance kyun dete hain? [Why do we give them so much importance?],"" legendary spinner Harbhajan Singh didn’t mince words when asked if India should boycott Pakistan in the upcoming Asia Cup , scheduled to be held in the UAE from September 9.Harbhajan was part of the recently concluded World Championship of Legends (WCL), where India Champions refused to play Pakistan Champions in the group stage and the semi-final. The squad — featuring stalwarts like Shikhar Dhawan, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan, Irfan Pathan, Suresh Raina , and Yusuf Pathan — took this stand in the wake of the gruesome Pahalgam terror attack For Harbhajan, “nation comes first,” and he believes the Suryakumar Yadav-led Indian team should refuse to play the neighbours.""They need to understand what is important and what is not. This is as simple as that. For me, humare desh ka wo jawan jo sarhad par khada hua hai, unki families jo kayi baar unko nahi dekh paati hain, unki shahadat ho jaati hai, wo ghar wapas nahi laut paate hain — unki itni badi sacrifice hoti hai hum sabke liye.

It’s a very small matter],"" Harbhajan told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.India are placed alongside Oman, hosts United Arab Emirates, and Pakistan in Group A.

The nation always comes first,"" Harbhajan said.""Whatever our identity is, it’s because of this country. Whether you are a player, an actor, or anyone else — no one is bigger than the nation. The country comes first, and the duties we owe to it must be fulfilled. Cricket match na khelna bahut maamuli si cheez hai desh ke saamne [Not playing a cricket match is nothing compared to the importance of the nation],"" the former spinner said.""Humare sarhad pe bhai khade hue hain, jo hume protect kar rahe hain, humare desh ko protect kar rahe hain — unke hausle dekho, wo kitna bada dil leke waha pe khade hue hain.

Look at their courage, the big hearts with which they serve. Think about what their families go through when they don’t return home. And here we are, playing cricket],"" he said.""Hum unko itni importance kyun dete hain? Are they that important? Are they that important ki har news channel unko chalaye? When you have boycotted them, when you don't want to talk to them, then why show them here? This is the duty of the media — to stop this. They shouldn't be adding fuel to the fire.""As I said, cricketers shouldn't be shaking hands with the Pakistan players, but the media shouldn't be showing them and their reactions on television, either.

Poll Do you think Rashid Khan can bounce back from this costly bowling performance? Yes, he is a top player No, it will affect his confidence

Birmingham Phoenix finally broke their losing streak in The Hundred 2025 with a thrilling four-wicket win over Oval Invincibles, but the night belonged to one extraordinary moment — Rashid Khan ’s outrageous helicopter six.Batting late in the Invincibles’ innings, Rashid stunned the crowd by whipping a full delivery over mid-wicket with the signature MS Dhoni-style helicopter shot. The ball sailed deep into the stands, sparking loud cheers and social media buzz.Yet, for all the brilliance of that single stroke, the rest of Rashid’s evening was one to forget. With the ball, he endured the most expensive spell in the history of the men’s Hundred, and the most expensive of his entire T20 career. Across his 20 balls, he conceded a staggering 59 runs without taking a wicket. The defining damage came in his final five deliveries, as Phoenix captain Liam Livingstone launched an assault worth 26 runs with a brutal sequence of 4, 6, 6, 6, 4.Chasing 181 on a good batting surface, Phoenix looked in trouble with 61 needed from the final 25 balls. Livingstone ’s carnage against Rashid shifted the momentum, and further big blows against Tom Curran brought the equation down to a manageable chase. Despite a late twist with Saqib Mahmood claiming two wickets in two balls, Benny Howell held his nerve to finish the job with two deliveries to spare.For Phoenix, it was a morale-boosting first win after two early defeats. For Invincibles, it was their first loss of the season. And for Rashid Khan, it was a night of extremes and producing one of the shots of the tournament but also suffering the costliest bowling figures of his career","Birmingham Phoenix beat Oval Invincibles by four wickets in The Hundred 2025.

Poll Do you believe Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma should continue playing ODIs until the 2027 World Cup? Yes, they should play. No, it's time to retire. Only if they are performing well.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is in no rush to make decisions about the ODI futures of cricket stars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , despite ongoing speculation. The matter has gained attention as India's next ODI series against Australia approaches in October, with questions arising about whether the duo, who have collectively scored 83 ODI hundreds and over 25,000 runs, can continue playing until the 2027 ODI World Cup.India's scheduled ODI series against Bangladesh in August has been canceled, making the Australia series from October 19-25 their next one-day international commitment.The age factor has become a significant talking point, as Kohli and Rohit would be 39 and 40 years old respectively by the 2027 ODI World Cup.""Obviously, if they (Rohit and Kohli) have something in mind, they would tell the BCCI brass like they did before the England Test tour. But from an Indian team's perspective, the next big assignment is the T20 World Cup in February and preparations before that. The immediate focus will be on sending the best team for the Asia Cup T20 tournament, hoping all players are fit and available,"" a BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.The BCCI is known for its measured approach to sensitive decisions, particularly considering the massive fan following of both players.The last tournament featuring both players was the Champions Trophy in Dubai, where Kohli scored a century against Pakistan in a group stage match, and Rohit contributed with a crucial half-century in the final.Neither player has participated in competitive cricket since the Indian Premier League (IPL) concluded.Kohli, now residing in London, has shown signs of returning to training, posting an Instagram story of an indoor nets session.Rohit, who was also in the UK post-IPL, has returned to Mumbai and is expected to begin training soon.While some media outlets have reported about BCCI potentially offering the duo a farewell game in Sydney on October 25, the BCCI source indicated no such discussions have taken place yet.""Even if they play Vijay Hazare, before that there would already be six ODIs that will be played. In between the Australia ODIs and the South Africa ODIs, there is an India A series against South Africa A where three List A games (50 overs) will be held at Rajkot on November 13, 16 and 19 respectively.""""Now, will the duo want to play those three A games, or possibly two, before the South Africa series is the question. Even more important is whether Ajit Agarkar and his colleagues would want that,"" the source added.The national One-Day Championship, Vijay Hazare Trophy, is scheduled to begin on December 24, 2025, preceded by a three-match ODI series against South Africa starting November 30.""Overlapping the Vijay Hazare Trophy (December 24, 2025 - January 18, 2025) will be the three ODIs between India and New Zealand (January 11, 14, 18). So even if they play the Vijay Hazare Trophy, it can't be for more than two to three games,"" the source concluded.","Board of Control for Cricket in India is in no rush to make decisions about the ODI futures of cricket stars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.

Poll Do you agree with Sunil Gavaskar's criticism of the ECB for not inviting Anderson and Tendulkar? Yes, they should have been invited No, it was not necessary Not sure I don't follow cricket

Legendary India cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has slammed the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for not inviting James Anderson and Sachin Tendulkar to the presentation ceremony of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.“This was the first-ever series named after Sachin Tendulkar and Jimmy Anderson, two of cricket’s greatest legends. One would have expected both to be present to hand over the trophy to the two captains, especially since the series ended in a draw,” Gavaskar wrote in his column for Sportstar.He also recalled a similar incident earlier this year in Australia, where he was excluded from the Border-Gavaskar Trophy presentation ceremony, with only Allan Border present at the conclusion. The explanation given at the time was that Australia had won the series, hence only their namesake was included.“To the best of one’s knowledge, both were in England at the time. So, were they simply not invited? Or was this similar to what happened in Australia earlier this year, when only Allan Border was asked to present the Border-Gavaskar Trophy because Australia had won the series? Since this England series was drawn, perhaps neither was asked to attend the presentation,” he said.Gavaskar also criticised the practice of awarding the newly introduced Pataudi Medal to the series-winning captain instead of the Player of the Series.“Mostly around the world, administrators are brought in to ensure profits and are quite good at it, but they may not have much knowledge about the history of the sport they are presiding over. So, these little gestures are not part of their scheme of things.Nobody from the Pataudi family was there either, for the Pataudi Medal, which was presented to the winning team’s captain.The drawn series showed how flawed the idea was of trying to make amends to the Pataudis by retiring the trophy named after them. Every time the series is drawn, the medal can’t be presented, can it? Wouldn’t it be better, therefore, to award the medal to the Player of the Series rather than the winning captain? And what if the captain himself has had an ordinary series and made little impact on the result?” Gavaskar said.",Gavaskar criticises ECB for not inviting Anderson and Tendulkar. He also criticises practice of awarding Pataudi Medal to the series-winning captain instead of the Player of the Series.

Pakistan’s crushing 202-run defeat to West Indies in Tarouba on Tuesday has gone straight into the record books as one of their heaviest losses in men’s ODI cricket.The result came in the series decider, with West Indies sealing a 2-1 win, making it their first bilateral ODI series victory over Pakistan since 1991. Shai Hope led from the front with an unbeaten century before pacer Jayden Seales ripped through Pakistan’s batting with six wickets.Chasing 295, Pakistan never got going. They lost three of their top four batters for ducks as Saim Ayub, Abdullah Shafique and captain Mohammad Rizwan departed inside the first three overs. By the ninth over, the score was 23 for 4. Seales dismissed Babar Azam for nine to make it 29 for 5, and the collapse continued. Salman Agha’s 30 was the top score in an innings that lasted just 29.2 overs.This margin of defeat now sits fourth on the list of Pakistan’s biggest losses in ODIs by runs.

Poll Should sports leagues allow athletes to promote their personal brands on platforms like OnlyFans? Yes, it's their personal choice. No, it conflicts with the league's image. It depends on the content shared.

England fast bowler Tymal Mills has been denied permission by the England and Wales Cricket Board to display his OnlyFans account logo on his bat during The Hundred cricket tournament in August 2025. Mills, who has played 16 T20 internationals and was part of England's 2022 World Cup-winning squad, joined the subscription platform to share content about his life as a professional cricketer.The 33-year-old left-arm fast bowler has not displayed the OnlyFans logo in his two appearances in The Hundred this season. The ECB's decision stems from OnlyFans not aligning with the family-friendly nature of The Hundred tournament.When announcing his platform membership, Mills stated: ""It's all about sharing my passion with you in a new way."" He further emphasized that his channel would give subscribers ""a closer, more personal look into life as a professional cricketer.""Mills, who holds the record as the leading all-time men's wicket-taker in The Hundred, maintains that the material on his OnlyFans channel is ""completely safe.""The fast bowler has already made significant contributions in the current tournament, demonstrating his value to the Southern Brave team.In their opening match, he secured figures of 3-22 and scored crucial six runs to help his team achieve a one-wicket victory over Manchester Originals.OnlyFans operates as an online platform where content creators can share photos, videos, and live streams that subscribers can access through monthly subscriptions, tips, and pay-per-view options. The platform retains approximately 20% of the fees, with creators receiving the remaining 80%.While OnlyFans is widely known for hosting adult content, it is not exclusively dedicated to such material. The platform supports various content creators across different fields and interests.This situation mirrors a similar case from May 2025, where British canoeist Kurts Adams Rozentals faced suspension from competition. Rozentals, who competes in individual canoe slalom, was suspended by Paddle UK following concerns about his social media posts, forcing him to choose between his Olympic aspirations and his OnlyFans account.Mills is reported to understand the ECB's decision regarding the logo display restriction. The ruling reflects the growing intersection between professional sports, personal branding, and content creation platforms, as athletes explore new ways to connect with their audience and diversify their income streams.The ECB's stance emphasizes their commitment to maintaining The Hundred's family-friendly image, even as professional athletes increasingly engage with various social media and content platforms to build their personal brands and connect with fans in new ways.This development occurs as The Hundred continues its mission to attract new audiences to cricket, particularly families and young fans, while balancing the evolving landscape of professional sports and digital content creation.",England fast bowler Tymal Mills has been denied permission by the England and Wales Cricket Board to display his OnlyFans account logo on his bat during The Hundred cricket tournament.

Poll Do you believe the emergency summit for Caribbean cricket will lead to long-term improvements? Yes No Not sure

West Indies secured their first bilateral ODI series victory against Pakistan since 1991 with a commanding 202-run win at Brian Lara Stadium in Tarouba, Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday. Captain Shai Hope 's unbeaten century of 120 runs and pace bowler Jayden Seales' impressive six-wicket haul led the Caribbean team to this historic triumph.The series win provided a much-needed boost for West Indies cricket following recent defeats across Test and Twenty20 formats to Australia and Pakistan. The victory came after a two-day emergency summit for Caribbean cricket, attended by cricket legends Brian Lara and Clive Lloyd, aimed at improving West Indies' international performance.""I'm extremely proud of the team,"" said the West Indies captain.""There's been a lot of stress on negatives in the game but now there's positives to shout about for West Indies cricket,"" Hope added.West Indies posted a formidable total of 294-6, with Hope's outstanding innings featuring five sixes and ten fours off 94 balls. He formed an unbroken seventh-wicket partnership of 110 runs with Justin Greaves, who contributed 43 not out from 24 deliveries.Pakistan's batting lineup crumbled under pressure, managing only 92 runs in 29.2 overs. The collapse began early with three ducks from their top four batsmen. Saim Ayub was caught behind early, followed by Abdullah Shafique's dismissal, and captain Mohammad Rizwan was bowled by Seales for a golden duck.Seales dominated the Pakistani batting order, finishing with impressive figures of 6-18 from 7.2 overs. Babar Azam was trapped lbw for 9 runs, while Hasan Nawaz was stumped for 13, and Hussain Talat was bowled for 1. Salman Agha top-scored for Pakistan with 30 runs off 49 balls.The series victory marked a significant turnaround for West Indies, who had previously lost eight consecutive matches to Australia and a Twenty20 series 2-1 to Pakistan in Florida. The emergency summit was convened after West Indies' disappointing performance in Australia, where they were dismissed for just 27 runs in their second innings of the third Test.After losing the ODI series opener to Pakistan by five wickets, West Indies bounced back to level the series with a five-wicket victory in the second match. The decisive third match ended dramatically with Abrar Ahmed being run out by Chase for a golden duck.The comprehensive victory demonstrated West Indies' resilience and potential for improvement in international cricket. The partnership between Hope and Greaves, along with Seales' exceptional bowling performance, proved crucial in securing this historic series win.","West Indies secured their first bilateral ODI series victory against Pakistan since 1991 with a commanding 202-run win at Brian Lara Stadium.

At the end of Day 25 of what had been a remarkable five-match Test series, India were the ones celebrating, soaking in the applause from a packed venue, doing a lap of honour of The Oval stadium. They had reason to be joyous, it had been a sensational turnaround from what looked like a near certain 3-1 series outcome just days ago. Or, worse, a 4-1 just a day ago. Instead, here, now, at that moment, it had become 2-2 in the inaugural Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.But to think of sport as linear and straightforward is taking away its essence. The sheer unpredictability, the off-script nature of it all is the beauty of it. That's what makes it intriguing, it could have been 3-1 or 4-1 to hosts England.From 0/2 at Old Trafford, trailing by 311 runs, five sessions remaining, India produced a staggering comeback to draw the fourth Test. Moving a few days forward, England were 42 runs from a win at The Oval, six wickets in hand, Joe Root in the middle, and were left six runs short.Except things don't always go to script and that's the beauty of any sport. If a ploy works, it is lauded as a great strategy. Genius. If it doesn't, it is lambasted for being too ambitious, absurd, or called out as 'Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!'All said and done, India had a glorious opportunity to tip the series their way, instead, as well.England didn't boss India around with tough conditions, spicy pitches or under the constant threat of some of the most menacing seamers. The batting didn't have the teeth, either, with the exception of Joe Root.Time and again, India played into England's hands. Even if you discount the baffling team selections, cavalier dismissals near the session breaks or losing heaps of wickets in a short duration. The Shubman Gill-led unit could have been walking back with a series win if they had done the basics right - catches and tight bowling. On both fronts, India gave away plenty of advantage and would be kicking themselves when the series would be assessed through a microscopic lense.By letting down 23 catches through the series, including 10 in the opener at Headingley, England were allowed to score 718 runs more. On the other hand, the Ben Stokes-led hosts were equally woeful - letting go of 17 catches that cost them 587 runs. On an average, India saw 31.21 runs being scored more as they let a chance go by. In the same department, England were slightly worse at 34.52 runs on an average.Another metric, that has been less discussed, has remained in the shadows, is the sheer audacity with which England scored runs against India throughout the series.India had 91 maiden overs throughout the five matches compared to England's 148. England's economy rate stood at 3.50 runs an over during the series while that of India was 3.98.Most of India's maidens came in the third Test, which incidentally England won by 22 runs. On the other end, India's fewest maidens came in the first and fourth Test where England scored 465, 373 and 669 runs, respectively.R Ashwin astutely observed that not only did England keep India's maidens down, they kept the scoring rate high to ensure they copped little pressure. ""As the understanding goes, if you bowl three maidens in a row, you will get a wicket-taking chance. But why have the maidens not come through from the India side? Two reasons - England put a lot of pressure. Barring Lord's, England played at (a) high accelerated pace. But another is that India's 1-2 run overs are low. India have (even) conceded 10-12 runs per over,"" he said on his YouTube show.""(Mohammed) Siraj, Prasidh (Krishna), Akash Deep need to find rhythm. For bowlers, until they get that rhythm, they need to place the field right to build that defensive pressure building, which India have missed. India could have attacked or bowled smartly against England to counter their Bazball approach,"" he added.Does Ashwin's argument hold up to the stats? Yes.So of the 808.4 overs that India dished out in the series, 53 of them, or 6.55% of them, saw at least 530 runs - or 16.43% of England's total runs.Simply put,. If basic mistakes and catches dropped were not gifts enough, here were India conceding runs aplenty, thereby squandering any hopes they had of tightening the noose on England. Any desire they had of putting pressure on the hosts, was let go of cheaply.Zoom in further and you identify the bowlers that leaked runs in abundance. Shardul Thakur , who played two matches, conceded 144 runs at an economy rate of 5.33. Anshul Kamboj, who came in as an injury substitute in the squad, went for 89 runs at an economy of 4.94. Prasidh Krishna was equally disastrous at 4.94 even though he salvaged some pride with 14 wickets, including an eight-wicket haul at The Oval.At the other end, Jasprit Bumrah , who played three Tests, was the most economical at 3.04, conceding a total of 364 runs. Also going at less than 4 runs per over were Ravindra Jadeja (3.56), Washington Sundar (3.64) and Nitish Kumar Reddy (3.96).In the end, the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy scoreline reads 2-2. India’s young, transitional side showed they could stand toe-to-toe with England in their own backyard, scripting moments of brilliance and resilience that will be remembered for years. Yet, they also left the door ajar far too often for what could have been a win.","England scored 16.43% of their series runs at a staggeringly brisk rate of 10+ runs an over. India had already bowled fewer maidens than England, India had 53 overs which went for more than 10 runs anover. India played into England's hands, with the exception of Joe Root.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123248261,imgsize-104786,width-400,resizemode-4/123248261.jpg"

NEW DELHI: MS Dhoni and his fan following is no secret. Wherever Dhoni goes, the fans follow.

Poll What do you think about Jack Grealish's loan move to Everton? A great decision for his career A mistake, he should have stayed at City

Manchester City winger Jack Grealish has joined Premier League side Everton on loan for the 2025-26 season.The 29-year-old struggled for game time under Pep Guardiola last season, making just seven Premier League starts. He was also left out of City’s squad for the Club World Cup in the United States, indicating his stagnant role at the club.Everton secured the deal for Grealish, reportedly earning £300,000 (over ₹3.5 crore) per week, ahead of their Premier League opener against Leeds on August 18.""I'm over the moon to have signed for Everton – it's massive for me, honestly. This is a great club, with great fans,"" Grealish said, as quoted by AFP.The England international has taken the number 18 shirt at Everton in tribute to two of his football idols. ""My two favourite English players ever are Wayne Rooney and Paul Gascoigne and I know they both wore number 18 here,"" he said.""I spoke to Wayne before I came here and I mentioned that to him – about the number 18 – so I hope he's happy as well.""Grealish joined Manchester City from Aston Villa in 2021 for a British record £100 million fee.He won three Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FA Cup, but his form dipped after the 2022-23 treble-winning season.Left out of England’s Euro 2024 squad, Grealish described the omission as “heartbroken”. Despite City’s struggles last season, Guardiola rarely selected him, including leaving him on the bench for the FA Cup final defeat to Crystal Palace.""As soon as I spoke to the manager, I knew there was only one place that I wanted to go,"" Grealish said. ""On social media, I've been flooded with messages from Everton supporters, so there's that side of it as well and that's another reason why I chose Everton.""I want to say thank you to the fans for all of the messages I've had already. Thank you for all of the love and support. I hope I can repay you now and I'm sure I will.""Everton manager David Moyes welcomed the signing. ""We welcome Jack to Everton and we're very pleased to have him on board. I think we're getting him at a good time because he's experienced, he understands the Premier League and we're all fully aware of the levels he's capable of performing to.""I know Jack's ambition is to get back into the England squad, so hopefully we can help him achieve that over the course of the season,"" Moyes said.Everton finished 13th in the Premier League last season, whereas City ended their campaign in 3rd after a disastrous start.",Jack Grealish has joined Everton on loan for the 2025-26 season.

Reece James wants to swap shirts with Zinedine Zidane and modelled his game on Didier Drogba.In a period of transition and high expectations at Chelsea, Reece James stands out as a player who embodies the club’s spirit and standards. A Cobham graduate and lifelong Blue, the 25-year-old has established himself as a leader within the squad, particularly after leading Chelsea to the Club World Cup title. The triumph holds special significance for the Chelsea captain. “Winning any title for this club is obviously a dream. To do so in the style we did, especially against the opponents we faced (PSG), meant a great deal,” he told TOI over an e-mail interview.Under Enzo Maresca’s leadership, as the squad evolves with new signings and departing players, James has assumed greater responsibility on and off the pitch. “It’s a natural part of top-level football—players come and go,” he says. “What’s important is that every new arrival understands our goals, our playing philosophy, and the standards expected at Chelsea.” James’ role in maintaining the club’s culture is central to ensuring that unity and accountability persist amidst changes.During the 2024-25 campaign, Chelsea secured victories in both the Club World Cup and the UEFA Conference Cup, in addition to finishing fourth in the Premier League. James views these achievements as evidence of the team progressing in the right direction. “Last season was a big step forward,” he reflects. “The manager brought a clear vision and a way of playing that the squad quickly adapted to. We believe we’re moving in the right direction and want to be right in that title race. ”Despite facing injuries in recent seasons, James remains a crucial figure. Whether advancing down the right flank or leading vocally from the back, his presence is significant.At just 25, Reece James has become a pillar of the Chelsea side. Grounded in his roots but aiming high, he is driven not only to wear the armband but to make it count.The boyhood blue, who first joined Chelsea FC at the age of six, rose through the ranks of the academy, James made his senior debut in 2019.

Why have Crystal Palace lost their appeal against demotion by UEFA to third-tier Conference League,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/why-have-crystal-palace-lost-their-appeal-against-demotion-by-uefa-to-third-tier-conference-league/articleshow/123251093.cms,"Crystal Palace lost its appeal at sport's highest court on Monday against demotion to the third-tier Conference League for breaching UEFA rules on club ownership with American investor John Textor.The Court of Arbitration for Sport said its judges dismissed the English cup winner's request to stay in the more lucrative second-tier Europa League in a case that also involved Premier League rival Nottingham Forest and French club Lyon.Forest and Lyon are confirmed taking entries directly into the Europa League in September and Palace must start in the Conference League qualifying playoff round next week. Palace was drawn last week to play Fredrikstad of Norway or Midtjylland of Denmark on Aug. 21 and Aug. 28.Palace has become a victim in a complex case - which developed last month when Lyon avoided mandatory relegation in France for financial turmoil - that focused attention on long-standing UEFA rules being tested by more overseas investment in European football, especially from the United States.UEFA demoted Palace because Textor had a 43% ownership stake last season while also owning Lyon. Palace missed a March deadline set by UEFA to solve the potential issue.CAS said its judges decided Textor ""was a board member with decisive influence over both clubs at the time of UEFA's assessment date.""The panel of three judges ""considered that the UEFA Regulations are clear and do not provide flexibility to clubs that are non-compliant on the assessment date,"" the court said in a statement.The case proceeded despite Textor selling his stake in Palace last month to New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, reportedly for at least $220 million. Johnson joins Palace chairman Steve Parish and fellow Americans Josh Harris and David Blitzer as partners and directors of the south London club.Unlike Palace, Forest and Lyon remain part of multi-club ownership networks though do not currently conflict with UEFA rules for entry to the next editions of European competitions. Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis also has Greek title holder Olympiakos which plays in the Champions League this season.Palace qualified on merit for the second-tier Europa League by winning the English FA cup against Manchester City in May - a first major trophy in the club's 120-year history.Palace protests The threat of UEFA sanctions for breaching multi-club ownership rules - drafted more than 25 years ago to protect the integrity of European competitions - cast a shadow over Palace's offseason celebrations and preparations for this season.At Wembley Stadium on Sunday, some Palace fans displayed the slogan ""UEFA Mafia"" ahead of the game against Liverpool in the season opener between the cup winner and league champion. Palace lifted another trophy by winning a penalty shootout after a 2-2 draw, less than 24 hours before a big loss at court.UEFA has repeatedly warned about the growing trend for investors to take stakes or full ownership in multiple clubs in different countries, and the potential threats to the integrity of games and the transfer market.Textor is among a slew of investors from the United States buying into the multi-billion dollar European football industry in recent years.He has been an increasingly controversial figure in global football, also owning Brazilian club Botafogo and Belgium's Molenbeek while being linked with a failed bid to buy Everton.Effects on the field If Palace advances to the Conference League's main phase, it will play just six guaranteed games against mostly lower-ranked opponents between September and December.Forest and Lyon will play eight Europa League games through January with the potential to earn tens of millions of euros (dollars) more in prize money from UEFA.While Palace will be among the favorites to win the Conference League title that Chelsea won last season, the sporting and financial demotion risks affecting its transfer market activity this month. Star players Marc Guehi and Eberechi Eze, both England national-team regulars, are targets for wealthier rivals.The UEFA rules Palace is the third club to lose at CAS in recent weeks in challenges to the multi-club ownership rules which now routinely create offseason uncertainty in European football because of investors' wide-ranging ambitions. Forest and Lyon also had faced compliance issues.UEFA previously removed two clubs from the Conference League lineup: Drogheda from Ireland and FC DAC 14 of Slovakia.Marinakis had formally stepped back from controlling Forest in April when it seemed the two-time European Cup winner might join Olympiakos and qualify for the Champions League with a top-five finish in the Premier League. Forest placed seventh, earned an initial Conference League entry and that let Marinakis retake full control.Lyon, which placed sixth in France's Ligue 1, has been in financial turmoil during Textor's ownership. It was able to enter the Europa League only after being reprieved on appeal last month from mandatory relegation to the second tier by the French football regulator.Textor stepped down as Lyon president and was replaced by American businesswoman Michele Kang.",Crystal Palace loses appeal against demotion to third-tier Conference League.

Poll Do you believe Crystal Palace can continue to build on their recent success? Yes, they are on the rise! No, it was just a lucky win.

Crystal Palace secured their first-ever Community Shield victory by defeating Premier League champions Liverpool 3-2 on penalties after a 2-2 draw at Wembley Stadium on Sunday. The match was played against the backdrop of tragedy following the death of Liverpool forward Diogo Jota in a car accident alongside his brother Andre Silva.Liverpool's new signings Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong scored for their side, while Palace responded through Jean-Philippe Mateta and Ismaila Sarr to force the game into penalties. Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson proved decisive in the shootout, saving attempts from Alexis Mac Allister and Harvey Elliott, while Mohamed Salah missed his spot-kick.The pre-match ceremony saw Liverpool legend Ian Rush and Palace chairman Steve Parish laying wreaths on the pitch in memory of Jota. The Liverpool end displayed numerous banners and flags paying tribute to the Portuguese international, though a minute's silence was cut short due to crowd disturbances.Liverpool fielded all four of their new summer signings, worth a combined £260 million, including Ekitike, Florian Wirtz, Frimpong, and Milos Kerkez.The club's record-equalling 20th league title last season prompted this significant investment in new talent.Ekitike, who joined from Eintracht Frankfurt for £69 million, made an immediate impact by scoring just four minutes into the match from Wirtz's assist. His performance came amid speculation about Liverpool's pursuit of Newcastle striker Alexander Isak.Palace, making their debut appearance in the Community Shield, demonstrated their ability to compete with Premier League elite. After Mateta missed a one-on-one opportunity against Alisson Becker, Sarr won a penalty after being fouled by Virgil van Dijk . Mateta converted the spot-kick to level the score.Liverpool's players wore a ""Forever 20"" emblem, commemorating Jota's retired shirt number, which they will display throughout the season. The team regained the lead when Frimpong's cross unexpectedly found the far corner of the net.Despite creating opportunities, including a missed chance by Ekitike from another Wirtz pass, Liverpool showed defensive vulnerabilities. Palace capitalized on this weakness when Sarr scored his fourth goal in seven matches against Liverpool, connecting with Adam Wharton's through ball.The match saw additional drama with a VAR review for a potential handball by Mac Allister before proceeding directly to penalties. In the shootout, Palace's Justin Devenny emerged as the unlikely hero, scoring the decisive penalty to secure the trophy.The victory builds on Palace's recent success, following their first major trophy win against Manchester City in May's FA Cup final. The result suggests Palace's growing stature in English football while highlighting potential defensive concerns for Liverpool's new-look squad under manager Slot.The match served as both the traditional season opener and a poignant tribute to Jota, whose tragic loss cast a shadow over Liverpool's pre-season preparations and summer transfer activities.","Crystal Palace defeated Premier League champions Liverpool 3-2 on penalties.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything.

You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

Jannik Sinner overcame multiple power failures and technical disruptions to defeat Gabriel Diallo 6-2, 7-6 (8/6) at the ATP and WTA Cincinnati Open on Monday.

""I just hope tomorrow is a day off. I need time to recover from such a great battle.""The defending champion sealed her victory with two crucial aces in the final moments. The match featured a remarkable 25-minute eighth game in the final set, which included 13 deuces.""It was all about momentum,"" Sabalenka said. ""I took some risks at the end, went for crazy shots, went to the net.""Raducanu, who received a warning for unauthorised conversations with her new Spanish coach Francisco Roig, remained positive despite the loss.""I can take lessons from this,"" Raducanu said.

Play at the Cincinnati Open was temporarily suspended on Monday due to a local power outage that affected both match operations and television broadcasts. The suspension occurred around 5pm local time when broadcast channels lost their court camera feeds, and matches had to be halted due to the inability to use electronic line calling systems, which are mandatory for ATP Tour events.The power outage impacted several ongoing matches, including Taylor Fritz's contest against Lorenzo Sonego and Benjamin Bonzi's match against Stefanos Tsitsipas. Multiple doubles matches were also in progress when the suspension was announced.The tournament officially addressed the situation through their social media channels, stating: ""Due to an on-site power outage, play is currently suspended.""Tennis pundit Gigi Salmon provided updates to Sky Sports viewers, explaining: ""Welcome back to the Cincinnati Open where unfortunately play is currently suspended. There is a local power outage which has meant a loss of pictures. The tennis did continue for a while. In that time, Taylor Fritz was able to complete that first set on a tiebreak against Lorenzo Sonego, and Benjamin Bonzi was able to come back from dropping the first set to Stefanos Tsitsipas, to move to 5-2 in the second [set] but a local power outage affects the electronic line calling. ""US broadcaster Tennis Channel also informed viewers through social media: ""Play in Cincinnati is currently suspended due to an onsite power outage.Stay tuned for updates on when the action resumes.""The suspension lasted approximately 90 minutes, with play resuming shortly after 6:30pm local time. It later appeared that the outage was due to a generator catching fire and impacting the power situation at the tournament in Mason.Before the power outage, several matches had been completed, including Emma Raducanu's three-hour and nine-minute battle against Aryna Sabalenka, which ended in a 7-6, 4-6, 7-6 defeat for the Briton.This incident marks the second time this season that a major ATP and WTA 1000 tournament has experienced power-related disruptions. A similar situation occurred at the Madrid Open in April, when a nationwide power cut in Spain forced the cancellation of all remaining matches for that day.Earlier in the day, before the power disruption, players including Anna Kalinskaya, Ekaterina Alexandrova, and Frances Tiafoe had successfully advanced to the last 16 of the tournament.","Play at the Cincinnati Open was temporarily suspended on Monday due to a local power outage.

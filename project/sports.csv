Rishabh Pant becomes most expensive IPL player after he goes to LSG for Rs 27 crore at IPL auction

A street-smart T20 bowler who can make the ball talk with his classical swing, Deepak Chahar will be donning the Mumbai Indians (MI) jersey in the next Indian Premier League (IPL) season, after the franchise bought him for Rs 9.25 crore at the IPL mega auction in Jeddah on Monday. Deepak will, thus, no longer be part of MS Dhoni 's Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and said that he will miss the icon's company.MI outbid Punjab Kings, who withdrew just before the bid crossed the Rs 8 crore mark, and CSK to get the swing bowler in their ranks on the second day of the auction.Deepak's base price was Rs 2 crore.In an interaction during the auction's live broadcast with Suresh Raina , his former teammate at CSK, Deepak said that his skills will be useful on the pacer-friendly Mumbai pitches, as compared to Chennai where spinners get more assistance.""Everytime I talk to (cousin) Rahul (Chahar), I say you are playing for the team (MI) I should be playing and I am playing for the team (CSK) you should be playing, skill-wise. Because in Chennai, there is help for the spinners and in Mumbai for fast bowlers. He couldn't come to Chennai, but I am going to Mumbai. So I will get that advantage,"" said Deepak.Rahul, meanwhile, has moved to Sunrisers Hyderabad, who bought the leg-spinner for Rs 3.20 crore.Further during their live interaction, Raina asked Deepak on a lighter note: ""Dhoni bhai ko miss toh karoge (will you miss Dhoni)?""Deepak's reply was obvious. ""Unko kaun nahi miss karega (who won't miss him),"" the right-arm pacer said.Deepak made his IPL debut in 2016 for the now-defunct Rising Pune Supergiants and was bought by CSK before the 2018 edition of the IPL and stayed with them until this auction.His best performance in an IPL season came in 2019 when he picked up 22 wickets in 17 games.He has been part of CSK's three title-winning campaigns -- 2018, 2021 and 2023.","MI outbid Punjab Kings, who withdrew just before the bid crossed the Rs 8 crore mark, and CSK to get the swing bowler in their ranks on the second day of the auction.

India's massive 295-run victory in Perth after being bowled out for just 150 in their first innings is being celebrated as one of the best Test victories on the Australian soil, as stand-in captain Jasprit Bumrah started a turnaround before Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli took over.

Look who has blown them away in the first Test,"" said an ecstatic Ganguly on the sidelines of the Indian Premier League auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where he is part of the Delhi Capitals camp as JSW Sports' Director of Cricket.""Indian cricket has enormous talent, and this is for Australia: Play well, otherwise it's going to be a long series for you,"" he warned the Aussies before praising India's star performers.""It's great to see Bumrah, wow!

We Indians will have to get used to that pink ball. But it's a long series and I've got my fingers crossed for India winning the series.""India will play a day-night practice match before the pink-ball Test in Adelaide beginning December 6.The visitors have been further bolstered as the team's regular skipper Rohit Sharma has joined them in Australia.

NEW DELHI: When Sanjiv Suryavanshi sold his farm land to fund his 10-year-old son Vaibhav's cricketing aspirations, little did he know that within three years the boy would be scripting history. During the second and final day of the IPL mega auction in Jeddah, Vaibhav, at 13 years and eight months, became the youngest cricketer ever to be picked by a franchise as Rajasthan Royals bought him for Rs 1.10 crore.Sanjiv, who owned farm land in his native Motipur village which is 15kms from Samastipur town in Bihar, was lost for words.""Woh ab sirf humra bituwa nahi pura Bihar ka bituwa hai (He is not just my son now but entire Bihar's son),"" Sanjiv told PTI over phone as his son is currently in Dubai for the U-19 Asia Cup.""My son has worked hard. At the age of 8 years, he excelled at U-16 district trials. I would take him for his cricket coaching to Samastipur and then take him back,"" he recalled the days of hardships.So were his finances in place as cricket is an investment?""Not just investment, it's big investment. Aapko kya bataye humne toh apna zameen tak bech diya. Abhi bhi halat pura sudhra nahi (I have sold my land. Financial issues are still there).""When asked about the controversies regarding Vaibhav's actual age which many believe is 15 years, the father was quick to clarify.""When he was 8 and half years old he first appeared for BCCI bone test. He has already played India U-19. We don't fear anyone. He can again undergo age test,"" he sounded defiant.Sanjiv said that Bihar Cricket Association president Rakesh Tiwary's ""blessings"" have always helped Vaibhav in his journey.""Rakesh ji ka ashirwaad raha hai bahoot (Rakesh ji's blessings are there).""His base price in the auction was Rs. 30 lakh and Delhi Capitals made the opening bid. RR entered the fray at Rs. 35 lakh and eventually got the better of DC to get the player on board.So how did this bidding war happened?""Rajasthan Royals had called him for trials in Nagpur. Vikram Rathour sir (batting coach) gave a match situation where he had to score 17 in an over. Bituwa ne 3 chakka mara. Trials mein aat chakka aur char chauwaa mara (He smashed three sixes. At trials, he hit eight sixes and four fours),"" the father claimed proudly.For a 13-year-old, it can be very difficult to understand what it means to earn a crore. So how does he plan to keep his young son away from monetary discussions?""He just wants to play cricket and nothing else. A few years back he loved Doremon, not anymore,"" Sanjiv said.BCA president Tiwary was all praise for the prodigy after his 1.10 crore bid for RR."" Vaibhav Suryavanshi 's incredible achievement at such a young age fills us with immense pride,"" Tiwary said in a statement.""His journey from Bihar to the IPL is a reflection of his talent, hard work, and determination. The Bihar Cricket Association has always believed in nurturing young talent, and Vaibhav's success highlights the cricketing potential in our state.""We are confident he will continue to shine and inspire aspiring cricketers across Bihar and beyond.

In 2018, he was named by the ICC as one of the top five breakout stars in men's cricket, showcasing immense potential.However, his career hit a stumbling block in 2019 when he received a doping ban from the BCCI, ruling him out of action until November that year.Also See: IPL Auction 2025",Prithvi Shaw went unsold at the IPL 2025 mega auction.

The other goals came from Jesus Jimenez (56) and KP Rahul (90+2) in the second half.Although Blasters controlled the match, it was the visitors who created the opening opportunity.A free kick awarded to Wilmar Jordan led to Lukas Brambilla's curling attempt towards the top left corner of Blasters' goal, but goalkeeper Sachin Suresh was equal to the task and thwarted the danger by saving the ball by diving to his right.Blasters slowly started taking control of the proceedings with their first notable chance arriving in the 17th minute.

Inter Milan moved top of Serie A on Saturday after a first-half blitz led to the Italian champions sweeping sorry Verona aside 5-0 and going two points clear, while AC Milan played out an uneventful goal-less draw with Juventus.Simone Inzaghi's side are provisionally ahead of Napoli after netting all five of their goals in the opening 45 minutes at the Stadio Bentegodi through a Marcus Thuram brace and further strikes from Joaquin Correa, Stefan de Vrij and Yann Bisseck.Atalanta will claim top spot with a win over promoted Parma in Saturday's late match, while on Sunday Napoli host Roma on Claudio Ranieri's return to top-flight management.Correa's opener in the 17th minute, a delightful dink after smart interplay with Thuram, didn't just spark a rout, it was also the Argentinian's first Serie A goal in over two years.Out-of-favour Correa had only played 38 minutes this season before this weekend but was excellent in place of captain and star striker Lautaro Martinez who was sent home early on Saturday with the flu.""I know him well, he's been training brilliantly since July, he's got a lot of competition,"" Inzaghi told DAZN.""I'm pleased for him but I'm also pleased for the boys because they played really well,"" he added.Correa, 30, hit the woodwork twice and also laid on Thuram for the first of his two near-identical goals, which were netted within the space of three minutes and came after the France forward skipped around Verona goalkeeper Lorenzo Montipo.By the time defenders De Vrij and Bisseck -- with another strike set up by Correa -- lashed in unlikely finishes Verona were submerged in boos and whistles from the home support who loudly chanted for their team to ""show some balls"".Verona have lost nine of their 13 league matches this season and sit 14th, just three points above the relegation zone.Inter now host Leipzig on Tuesday as they push for direct qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League, having thumped Verona with a clutch of starters either injured or rested.As well as Martinez, Hakan Calhanoglu, Federico Dimarco and Benjamin Pavard missed Saturday's match after a busy period on international duty.Juve trail Inter by three points in sixth place after offering little to shout about at the San Siro.Ravaged by injuries, including to starting centre-forward Dusan Vlahovic, coach Thiago Motta was forced into an experimental line-up featuring midfielder Teun Koopmeiners up front.Despite the depleted line-up Juve had more shots on target -- two to one -- in a hugely disappointing contest in front of a crowd of more than 75,000.""I'm pleased with our performance, especially defensively against a team which created very little,"" Motta said to DAZN.""All in all we played well, I think a point right now keeps us going.

'Inexplicable'

Vigo: La Liga leaders Barcelona suffered a dramatic collapse in a 2-2 draw at Celta Vigo on Saturday.Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski's goals put the Catalans in a healthy position but Marc Casado's red card in the 82nd minute helped Celta snatch a point.Alfonso Gonzalez capitalised on a Jules Kounde error to pull a goal back before Hugo Alvarez levelled two minutes later.Barcelona have won 11 league games this season but this became the third they have failed to take three points from without teenage winger Lamine Yamal.Coach Hansi Flick said he would challenge his side to win without the injured 17-year-old wing wizard and it seemed like they were managing it until their spectacular late crumble.Barcelona are five points clear of Atletico Madrid at the top of La Liga, with champions Real Madrid, third, playing on Sunday at Leganes.""We had the game under control but the red card had a big impact on us and they scored two goals in two moves and we have to learn from that,"" Barcelona midfielder Gavi told DAZN.""The first goal was so stupid, we have to clear the ball there, but it's football and we have to learn from it, with one man less it's hard.""Gavi made his first start in over a year after recovering from a severe knee injury.""I'm happy, after a year, but the truth is the important thing was the three points and it wasn't possible,"" added the 20-year-old.Flick shifted Raphinha into Yamal's position on the right, using Dani Olmo on the left and Pedri in attacking midfield.Raphinha opened the scoring in the 15th minute, slotting home neatly to continue his fine form after Kounde lofted a ball forward for him.Barcelona left-back Gerard Martin was issued an early booking and lived on the edge in the first half, nudging over Iago Aspas as he ran through but just about staying on the right side of the law.The defender then fouled Aspas before half-time and was lucky to escape a second booking as Celta's captain fumed and was issued a yellow card himself for his outburst.Flick brought off Martin at the break for Hector Fort, fearing a potential dismissal.Hunting for Barcelona's second, Lewandowski had produced a fine lobbed finish in the first half but the goal was chalked off for offside.The forward was not to be denied though and just after the hour mark he stroked home Barcelona's second after Raphinha played him in.It was the 36-year-old striker's 15th league goal of the campaign, further extending his vast lead as La Liga's top scorer.Inaki Pena made a handful of saves for Barcelona, denying Hugo Alvarez with his leg.Raphinha could have killed the game off completely but the winger hit the post with a low effort after being sent through.The Catalans were reduced to 10 men after 82 minutes when recent Spain debutant Casado picked up his second yellow card for fouling former Barca midfielder Ilaix Moriba.It restored Celta's belief and moments later they pulled one back when Kounde dallied on the ball in his own area and Gonzalez picked his pocket and finished past Pena.Two minutes later Alvarez levelled for Celta as Barcelona collapsed, cutting in from the right and finishing clinically to snatch a point.Celta, 11th, have a strong record at Balaidos against Barcelona in recent years and the players celebrated with their fans at the end of the game.""We found ourselves with that red card and the (first) goal, and then the second came, it's inexplicable,"" said a delighted Alvarez.""We got the draw, we wanted more -- this team has great quality.""",Barcelona held to a 2-2 draw by Celta Vigo in La Liga on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Tottenham delivered a crushing 4-0 victory at the Etihad, ending Manchester City 's impressive 52-game unbeaten home streak on Sunday.The first half saw James Maddison score twice within seven minutes, followed by Pedro Porro's goal against his previous club and Brennan Johnson's finishing touch to complete the victory.This defeat, City's first at home from open play since before the 2022 World Cup, leaves them trailing Premier League leaders Liverpool by five points.Liverpool have a game remaining against bottom-placed Southampton on Sunday.The victory provides relief for Tottenham and Ange Postecoglou as they advance into the top six positions.Despite recently extending his contract until 2027, Pep Guardiola faces the challenge of addressing the worst performance streak in his managerial career.The anticipated revival of the four-time consecutive Premier League champions following Guardiola's new contract failed to materialise.Before the match, Rodri displayed his Ballon d'Or trophy to supporters, with his name illuminated across the Etihad pitch.The Spanish midfielder, aged 28, is sidelined for the remainder of the season due to knee ligament damage sustained in September, and his absence has significantly affected City's performance.City began positively with Guglielmo Vicario stopping Erling Haaland's attempt, followed by another deflected shot from the Norwegian.The match's direction shifted dramatically with Tottenham's first serious offensive move after 13 minutes.Dejan Kulusevski provided an excellent cross to Maddison, who finished with precision.Recently excluded from Postecoglou's starting lineup, Maddison was determined to demonstrate his worth.Son Heung-min's creative pass enabled the England player to score his second goal, lifting the ball over the advancing Ederson.Tottenham's season has been marked by fluctuating performances.Following a 2-1 home loss to Ipswich before the international break, which dropped them to 10th position, they have now secured two significant victories in Manchester, including a 3-0 win at Old Trafford.Ederson made an excellent save to prevent Dominic Solanke from scoring before halftime.Seven minutes into the second half, Kulusevski's cross found Solanke, who assisted Porro's powerful close-range finish.Haaland nearly scored from an acute angle, hitting the crossbar as City struggled to respond.The final blow came when Timo Werner outpaced Kyle Walker and crossed for Johnson to score at the far post. Kevin De Bruyne 's return as a late substitute after two months offers City some optimism.However, Guardiola must find quick solutions to maintain their title defence, with a challenging visit to Anfield next, where City haven't won before spectators since 2003.","Tottenham beat Manchester City 4-0 at the Etihad on Sunday.

Alaaeddine Ajaraie could not continue his record-breaking scoring spree to the ninth Indian Super League game. Their defensive strongman Asheer Aktar received his first yellow of the season in a Saturday clash that saw seven yellow cards, and a red.However, it was the resolve and grit of North East United FC that earned them a hard-fought 2-1 victory against Punjab FC in New Delhi, despite playing the second half with 10 men.The win — their 4th in nine games — extended their unbeaten run to four and broke the trend of losing points late on.They had fired in both their goals in the opening 20 minutes with Ajaraie turning provider to Giullermo Hierro’s 15th minute opener and No. 10 Nestor Albiach drilling in the second with a perfect volley in the 18th minute. The win propelled Juan Pedro Benali ’s men to the third spot with 15 points — two points behind new leaders Mohun Bagan Super Giants , who went atop beating Jamshedpur FC 3-0 at the Saltlake stadium in Saturday’s second game, and Bengaluru FC.Benali stuck to his preferred 4-2-3-1 formation as Punjab FC adopted a physical approach from the outset to disrupt NEUFC’s attacking force with the referee brandishing three yellow cards – two to Punjab and one to NEUFC defender Dinesh Singh – within the opening 10 minutes, reflecting the intense nature of the contest.Ajaraie had his first shot on goal — his 45th of the ISL season and the only one of the game — in the 9th minute, but it was in the 15th minute that NEUFC broke the deadlock. Macarton Nickson sent a cross from midfield to Alaaeddine on the left side of the box, and the Moroccan delivered a precise cross at the goalmouth for the onrushing Gillermo to guide into the net.Just three minutes later, the Highlanders had doubled their lead. Winger Buanthanglun Samte, who enjoyed ample space on the left flank, sent a cross into the box, and Albiach was on hand to volley the ball past the Punjab FC goalkeeper Ravi Kumar with precision and power.However, Punjab coach Panagiotis Dilmperis’s words at the half-hour drinks break was heeded by his players as they began attacking in search of an equaliser. Lead striker, Luka Majcen, came close to scoring on a couple of occasions, but the visiting defenders held firm.With the hosts pushing hard, Dinesh earned his second yellow card for an unnecessary foul just outside the box in the 5th minute of first-half added time, reducing NEUFC to 10 men.Punjab earnestly tried to take advantage of their numerical superiority after the change of ends, maintaining most of the possession and registering all shots on target, but their efforts were met by the Highlanders’ defence, led by skipper Miguel Zabaco.Their perseverance, however, paid off in the 88th minute when NEUFC custodian Gurmeet Singh failed to hold on to a shot from Asmir Suljic, and defender Ivan Novoselec was in the right place to score on the rebound, reducing NEUFC’s lead.Despite the late goal, NEUFC held their nerve to secure a crucial three points, keeping their team in the hunt for a top-four finish.","North East United FC beat Punjab FC 2-1 in Indian Super League.

KOLKATA: Mohun Bagan SG moved to the top of Indian Super League standings with a comfortable 3-0 win over Jamshedpur FC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. A Liston Colaco magic on the cusp of half-time on either side of goals from Tom Aldred (15th minute) and Jamie Maclaren (70) handed Jose Molina ’s side their fifth win in eight games.Both Mohun Bagan and Bengaluru FC have 17 points each, but Colaco and Co.are topping the table thanks to a better goal difference. Jamshedpur FC have 12 points.While Mohun Bagan’s progress under Molina is on the upswing, it’s another blow to the faltering Jamshedpur FC. Khalid Jamil’s team which had won four of their first five matches, has now suffered three losses in a row, conceding 13 goals. Jamil was suspended from the match but his assistant Steven Dias could do little to stop the team from going into a free fall.Before the kick-off, Mohun Bagan fans group Mariners Arena unveiled a giant tifo paying a tribute to the club’s foreign players and their family members. And Molina’s brigade lived up to expectations with a clinical and confidence-oozing performance.Mohun Bagan deservedly went ahead in the 15th minute with a number of players involved in the lead-up to the goal. A Petratos corner was initially cleared out of the Jamshedpur FC box. But Deepak Tangri, starting in place of injured Asish Rai, took an ambitious shot from outside the box. As the ball bounced off a JFC defender’s feet and went up in air, Alberto Rodriguez headed it on the path of fellow defender and Aldred came up with an acrobatic half-volley beating the goalkeeper all ends up.Albino, however, denied Petratos and Liston with a couple of alert saves in quick succession but when Bagan’s No. 17 came calling in the first-half injury time, he could only watch hopelessly how the rival left the defence in shreds.Having received the ball from Manvir Singh, Liston cast his spell on the entire JFC defence in no time. On entering the box, his body feints were jaw-dropping as he took the challenges from Jamshedpur’s Tangkhulnao, Stephen Eze and Subham Sarangi in his stride one after another with wonderfully executed fakes and feints before coolly placing the ball in past a hapless Albino.That goal virtually killed the game as a contest. Although JFC tried to generate some semblance of fight after the break, the man-of-the-match Manvir came up with another assist following Tangri’s long ball, rounding the goalkeeper and laying it for Maclaren to tap it into an open net.",Mohun Bagan SG moved to the top of Indian Super League standings with a comfortable 3-0 win over Jamshedpur FC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.

Chelsea secured a 2-1 victory against Leicester City at the King Power Stadium , moving them closer to the top of the Premier League table.Nicolas Jackson and Enzo Fernandez scored for Chelsea, while Jordan Ayew netted a late penalty for Leicester.Chelsea's win, their first after two consecutive draws, propels them to 22 points, trailing league leaders Manchester City by a single point and maintaining a three-point advantage over fourth-placed Arsenal.Leicester City manager Enzo Maresca expressed his pride in his team's performance despite the limited preparation time following the international break.“The only thing I asked the players before the game, I said, 'Guys, we have the chance today to make a statement in terms of (who) we are',” he told TNT Sports.“Because when you play this kind of game, all the clubs that they are behind, like in this moment, I don't know, Arsenal or Villa or Brighton or (Manchester) United, Tottenham, they are watching.“They are waiting for us to drop points. And we show that we are there. And we're going to compete until the end and then we'll see where we arrive.”The match marked Maresca's return to the King Power Stadium, where he guided Leicester City back to the Premier League in his sole season with the club.Chelsea dominated the early stages, with Joao Felix, making his first Premier League start of the season, testing the Leicester defense.Chelsea's breakthrough came when Nicolas Jackson outmuscled Leicester defender Wout Faes, receiving a pass from Enzo Fernandez and slotting the ball home for his seventh league goal of the season.Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen denied Noni Madueke, and Madueke had a goal ruled out for offside in the first half.Leicester grew into the game, creating chances through Oliver Skipp and Wilfred Ndidi.Chelsea had an opportunity to extend their lead early in the second half but failed to convert a golden opportunity, with Madueke inadvertently blocking Cole Palmer's goal-bound shot.Fernandez eventually doubled Chelsea's lead, heading in after Hermansen saved Jackson's header.Leicester substitute Stephy Mavididi had a penalty appeal turned down before fellow substitute Jordan Ayew converted a penalty in stoppage time.The penalty proved to be a mere consolation for Leicester, who remain precariously close to the relegation zone, just three points above the drop zone.","Chelsea beat Leicester City 2-1 at the King Power Stadium.

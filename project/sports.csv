When competitive appearances become few and far between, every outing becomes an event. The airport arrivals. Hotel departures. Out-and-about visuals. The doomscrolling on social media gets a different vibe with choicest, peppy songs in the background. Immediately, nostalgia brings a smile to the face while many, including yours truly, look for cues in the body language.That is what seeing Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma does to you now. The omnipresent figures of Indian cricket up until 12 months ago barely went off the screen earlier considering the amount of cricket they played. Retirements from T20Is and Tests has changed all that.As much as this is a challenge for the fans to come to terms with, it is possibly even more difficult for Rohit (38) and Virat (37) to navigate with the reduced game time. For players accustomed to non-stop cricket, playing just a handful of ODIs presents a unique challenge. Dealing with the ageing body, preventing rustiness from creeping into their game, shutting out the outside noise and readjusting their focus to lock on the 2027 ODI World Cup target.Both have already mentioned about having a crack at the multi-nation event in South Africa and their recent actions are clearly pointing in that direction. Rohit has undergone a tremendous transformation; not only has he lost over 10 kgs, but he has also overhauled his lifestyle.From portion control to intense focus on workouts, the former India captain has never had such a razor-sharp focus on fitness. The time off not only allowed him to reboot but also put his body through a continuous boot camp.""Dubey ji"" has become a regular feature in his social media uploads but it's not just for laughs. Amit Dubey is a seasoned physiotherapist who works with the Mumbai Indians and has spent a lot of time with Rohit in the last few months. He even travelled with the 38-year-old to Ranchi (for the first ODI against South Africa on November 30).Rohit is not leaving anything to chance. No matter what the world says, even he, by now, would have figured that as long as the bat is firing and the body remains in shape, the World Cup dream is alive. Batting sessions at Centre of Excellence, the Azad Maidan and indoor nets keep the batting in check while the barbells and weights take care of the rest.It hasn't been any different for Virat. Yes, the time zone is different because he is with his family in London when not playing for the country and even there he has ensured to keep the rust away. For a cricketer who revolutionised fitness in the country, there was not an iota of doubt about him remaining in shape, even at 37, and that has been the case. For Virat, it was never about cricket and fitness. A champion of the format, he has cracked the chanceless template for the ODI game in the last few years and has elevated the consistency to even higher levels.The only worry with the former captain was whether he would still have the desire to continue playing for almost two years. The desire to embrace the relentless grind for one last dance in South Africa.The Australia series was his first appearance for India after the Champions Trophy and that is where even the dressing room got the vibe that 'King is not going anywhere.' He didn't have good outings in the first two ODIs but rolled back the years with that chanceless stand with Rohit in the final ODI. The series was lost but RoKo reminded everyone of their class in the format and why they are still up for the challenge.But it isn't going to be just about cricket and fitness going forward. Both Rohit and Virat would need to shut off outside noise, deal with the selection committee, and secure the backing of the coaching set-up and the BCCI. It sounds foolish that players of this repute, stature and talent need to worry about these things in a format which they have bossed for over a decade but the recent events would have made them a bit more vigilant. Rohit's unceremonious exit as ODI skipper and the non-committal tone in statements made by chief selector Ajit Agarkar and coach Gautam Gambhir would have ensured the two legends keep their guard up at all times Almost every press conference attended by Agarkar has included a RoKo question but has not produced an assuring response. The same has been the case with Gambhir as the duo has maintained that the World Cup is still more than two years away.""They are part of the squad at the moment in Australia. They are incredible players, but it is not the forum to harp on about individual players. Two years from now, it is difficult to say what the situation will be. Who knows, there can be younger players who will take the spot. Both are great players, and they will not be put to the test in every match. Once they start playing, we will assess the situation. It is about winning trophies, not just runs. It is not like if they score three hundreds in the Australia series, they will play the World Cup in 2027. We have to take the situation into consideration,"" Agarkar had said at the NDTV World Summit 2025.""Look, 50-over World Cup is still two-and-a-half years away, and I think it is very important to stay in the present,"" Gambhir had echoed similar views in a press conference after India beat West Indies 2-0 in their Test series.""That is very important. Obviously, they are quality players, they are coming back, their experience is going to be a handful in Australia as well. Hopefully, those two guys will have a successful tour, and more importantly, as a team, we will have a successful series.""There are strong murmurs that the decision-makers are waiting for a slip-up by Rohit or Virat - whether it's a dip in form or fitness concerns. It is reliably learnt that chief selector Agarkar has assured he will act tough if they don't play in the domestic circuit after the South Africa ODIs. While Rohit is likely to turn up for Mumbai, it is understood that Virat plans to play some Vijay Hazare Trophy games for Delhi in Bengaluru.Before that, though, Virat is likely to fly back to London after the culmination of the three ODIs vs South Africa but could well link-up with the Delhi team in Bengaluru. There hasn't been any communication with the DDCA in this regard but India's No.3 had more or less sorted his schedule for the rest of the year in Australia itself. There could be an alteration to this plan according to the team's schedule for the New Zealand ODIs, starting January 11, but Virat could turn up for a few games of VHT, starting December 24.The noise will continue. Statements will continue to be made but the three-ODI series starting Sunday gives the fans an opportunity to enjoy the event, which snowballs into a spectacle on matchday.The number of Instagram Reels will exponentially increase, different tracks will be tried but the thumb will not give up when the scrolling continues. In the chaos that Indian cricket continues to be, Rohit and Virat remain the much-needed calm.Over to the 2027 World Cup now: 22 months to go...","Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli last played for India in the ODI series against Australia this month.

The turning point came in the 19th over when a third-umpire call triggered visible frustration in the Pakistan camp.With Sri Lanka struggling, Dasun Shanaka miscued a slower delivery towards short third, where Fakhar Zaman completed what appeared to be a clean catch. Although the on-field decision was out, the third umpire overturned it after deeming the ball had touched the turf on landing. The reversal left Pakistan visibly stunned, with Fakhar and Shaheen expressing disbelief as the not out decision was confirmed.On the very next ball, Shaheen hit back. He bowled Shanaka with another slower delivery, sending the leg stump crashing. Shaheen then turned back towards the umpire’s direction with his arms raised, an appeal that doubled as a pointed response to the previous decision. Fakhar also gestured towards the TV umpire as Pakistan channelled their frustration into celebration.Shaheen struck again two balls later, removing Maheesh Theekshana for 1, caught by Usman Khan off a top edge while attempting a fine scoop.

Quinton will make a grand impact for us: SA batting coach

Following the 0-2 loss in the just-concluded Test series, India are looking to push the restart button. And what better way than to bank on two of the stalwarts of the ODI format, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , as the hosts aim for a turnaround in fortunes.India stand-in skipper KL Rahul feels the freshness and experience of the senior pros will be more than helpful in this situation.“Taking singles is as important as hitting boundaries in ODI cricket and in Test cricket, maybe not as much in the T20 format. That’s something Virat has done so well over his career, and it’s something that we have looked at Virat and tried to learn,” Rahul said when asked about Kohli putting a lot of importance on singles at the nets on Friday.“Even in the dressing room, we all talked to him and Rohit about how we can get better as batsmen, and how we can rotate the strike a lot more.“He’s obviously the master at doing that in ODI cricket. We are really happy that he is back in the dressing room. He is very excited to be here and play these games,” added Rahul.Apart from Kohli and Rohit, veteran all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja is likely to add value to the squad. “He’s done the job time and again.I’m happy to have him back again with the ODI team. He missed out on the Australia series, but he was key in us winning the Champions Trophy with bat and ball and in the field. He is someone who can do everything. I think it’s great to have players that have experience, have done it time and again,” said Rahul.Hoping to continue their recent form in Tests, South Africa batting coach Ashwell Prince said on Saturday they need to improve in “clutch moments”. Accepting Kohli and Rohit’s impact on the game, the former Proteas batter said they are focusing on the damage the duo can cause to the hosts. However, he was quick to add that De Kock could have a similar impact for the Proteas.“He’s massive. Just like Rohit and Virat strengthen India, Quinny has a similar effect for us,” Prince said. “His experience and the quality he showed in Pakistan boosts the dressing room,” he added.",South Africa take on India in first ODI in Ranchi on Sunday.

Gautam Gambhir fiery press conference: On whitewash, Rishabh Pant shot, pitch and more

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh did not hold back after India slipped to their second home Test series defeat against South Africa. He said that if Indian cricket wants to protect its “future generations”, the team management must rethink its approach to home pitches and move away from heavily spin-assisted surfaces that previously helped them dominate for over a decade — a run that ended when New Zealand handed India a whitewash last year.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Harbhajan criticised the current standards of Test preparation, saying Indian players have forgotten how to compete over five days because of surfaces that consistently produce two- or three-day matches. He added that the nature of these pitches contributed to declining batting numbers for stars like Virat Kohli Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, eventually leading to their exit from the Test setup.""We do not know how to play matches for five days. We have got so used to playing so many matches on wickets where matches last for two-three days... Nowadays, it has reduced averages of our batters like Virat Kohli, Pujara, Rahane to 35-40 from 50... Our old greats were greats because they knew how to play five days of Test match cricket.""He urged Indian cricket to move on from its past and prioritise better pitches over favourable results.""For the betterment of Indian cricket, I think they should forget what has happened in the last 10 to 12 years... start playing on better wickets to save the future generation of Indian cricket.""Harbhajan added that Test cricket demands patience and discipline — qualities he feels have faded due to recent conditions.""The kind of temperament needed to play Test cricket requires effort, hard work, discipline, and I feel that for many years this has been missing.""He further argued that good wickets produce fair contests and reveal the true winner over the full duration of a match.""But what happens on a good wicket? A good wicket makes the game last five days... This lottery type situation, earlier New Zealand got lucky, now South Africa got lucky...""Harbhajan also analysed India’s performance in Guwahati, where the pitch appeared fair and the match reached the final day — yet India collapsed twice.""South Africa won the toss on this pitch and made 489... And then in the second innings, Team India collapsed for 140... So this is not just the fault of the pitch. I feel the biggest fault is your temperament.""South Africa dominated the Test through strong batting contributions led by Senuran Muthusamy’s maiden century and Marco Jansen’s explosive 93. Jansen, who also took 6/48 in the first innings, dismantled India’s batting order before Simon Harmer completed the rout with a match-winning 6/37 in the second innings. Ravindra Jadeja’s fifty and Sai Sudarshan’s gritty 139-ball vigil were among the few bright moments in a forgettable chase of 549.South Africa sealed a commanding 408-run win, with Harmer finishing as Player of the Series for his 17 wickets across two Tests, while Jansen claimed the Player of the Match award for his all-round brilliance.",Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh criticises current standards of Test preparation.

NEW DELHI: India’s Women’s World Cup hero Jemimah Rodrigues has withdrawn from the remainder of the Women’s Big Bash League (WBBL) season, choosing to stay back home to support close friend and teammate Smriti Mandhana after her wedding was postponed due to a sudden health issue concerning Mandhana’s father. Jemimah, who had flown to India 10 days ago after Brisbane Heat’s match against Hobart Hurricanes for what was supposed to be a brief pre-arranged trip, was scheduled to rejoin her WBBL side this week. But with the unforeseen development, she requested a release — one the franchise agreed to without hesitation.“The Brisbane Heat have agreed to a request to release Jemimah Rodrigues from the remainder of the Women’s Big Bash League,” the club announced in a statement. It confirmed that Rodrigues “returned home to India” for Mandhana’s wedding but stayed back after the celebrations were “subsequently postponed due to a health issue with Mandhana's father.”The Heat said they fully supported Jemimah’s decision: “Rodrigues will stay in India to support her teammate, and the Heat has agreed to her not returning for the final four games of the WBBL season.”Jemimah, who was Brisbane Heat’s No.1 pick in the International Player Draft this year, had been in strong form and remains a key figure in India’s cricketing rise.She was instrumental in India clinching their maiden Women’s World Cup title, smashing an unbeaten century in the semifinal against seven-time champions Australia — a knock that has already entered Indian cricket folklore.Brisbane Heat CEO Terry Svenson called it “a challenging time” for the 24-year-old. “While it is unfortunate that she will take no further part in the WBBL, we were more than willing to agree to her request to remain in India,” he said. “The Heat club obviously wish her and Smriti Mandhana's family all the best. Jemi told us she was disappointed not to be coming back and has passed on her appreciation to the club and the fans for being so understanding. ”With Rodrigues staying back, the Heat will now play their final league games without one of their biggest international stars — but with full empathy for her decision.",Jemimah Rodrigues has withdrawn from the remainder of the Women's Big Bash League.

Look who is back! Virat Kohli arrives for the ODI series vs South Africa

WATCH: Dhoni driving Kohli back to hotel

NEW DELHI: In one of the most heart-warming off-field moments Indian cricket has witnessed in recent years, a video of MS Dhoni personally driving Virat Kohli back to the Indian team hotel after a private dinner at his Ranchi residence set social media into a frenzy on Thursday night. The clip, shared widely by fans on X, shows Dhoni behind the wheel of his SUV with Kohli seated beside him — a rare yet deeply nostalgic sight that instantly triggered a wave of emotional reactions across the cricket community.The former India captain hosted Kohli and wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant at his Ranchi farmhouse on November 27, a quiet evening that turned into an internet-breaking reunion once fans spotted Kohli entering the Dhoni residence. Hours later, Dhoni drove Kohli back — no security entourage, no flashy escort — resurrected memories of their long partnership that shaped Indian cricket for more than a decade. While sharing the video, Star Sports even captioned it the “Reunion of the Year.”Kohli, who returned to India from London on Wednesday, is in Ranchi ahead of the first ODI against South Africa on November 30. The series marks his comeback to Ranchi for a match after missing the England Test in February 2024, the last time the city hosted an international match, due to the birth of his son, Akaay.He last featured for India on October 25 in Sydney, where his unbeaten 74 helped India avoid a whitewash against Australia.As Team India prepares for the three-match ODI series — with KL Rahul leading the side due to injuries to Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer — Kohli is set to slot back at No. 3. His ODI numbers remain unmatched: 14,255 runs, 51 centuries, and record-breaking consistency across formats.Pant, meanwhile, returns to the ODI setup after more than a year as India aim to bounce back following the Test series defeat to South Africa. With Rohit Sharma , Yashasvi Jaiswal, and a revamped middle order, the team will look to start strong in Ranchi.","MS Dhoni personally drives Virat Kohli back to the Indian team hotel after a private dinner at his Ranchi residence.

NEW DELHI: Chess-wise, Wednesday was a day of celebration. Edging toward its final month, the year produced its second 19-year-old, and youngest-ever, World Cup winner. The first, of course, was India’s own Divya Deshmukh, who brought home the women’s title earlier this year. The second is Uzbekistan’s Javokhir Sindarov, a name not many would have pencilled in while predicting the line-up for the 2026 Candidates.But with the title in Goa, Sindarov booked the ticket for the 2026 Candidates, where he will attempt to earn a shot at D Gukesh’s World Championship title.Much like Divya, who had entered the fray as the 15th seed during her career-defining triumph in Georgia, Sindarov too was far from the favourites. Remarkably just a day older than Divya, the Uzbek teenager began as the 16th seed and capitalised brilliantly on the knock-out format, stringing together a dream run that ultimately carried him to the title.Yet beneath the celebration lay disappointment and the void of a missed chance.India hosted the World Cup after 23 long years, with a record 24 home players in the field, but not one made the top three qualifying spots for the Candidates.Arjun Erigaisi came the closest before bowing out in the quarterfinals with a defeat to China’s Wei Yi, who finished runner-up.So the question remains: what went wrong for the Indians?Just around a month back, the journey of the World Cup began with 206 players from across the globe. Known for its gruelling 90+30 time control and subsequent rapid tie-breaks, it’s one of the few elite events that works entirely on knockout. In short: one bad day and you’re out.""FIDE World Cup is a type of tournament where everybody out of the top 10 or 20 has a 15% chance of winning,"" GM Levon Aronian had said before the tournament began.The match structure mostly favours the lower-rated player.“It’s just two classical games… quite often the sides that are more or less not as highly rated will make a draw with white and wait for their chance (with black). Everything can happen in one single game,” Levon recently told TimesofIndia.com.Playing with White, a higher-rated player often feels obliged to press, to prove an advantage from the first move. But that freedom can backfire. In a knockout format, the player with Black can simply stay solid, wait for a slip, and suddenly the burden shifts. This year, in both the Women’s and Open World Cups, several matches hinged on a single game where White overreached and paid the price.India’s top seeds weren’t immune. Gukesh, Arjun Erigaisi, Pentala Harikrishna, Vidit Gujrathi, and Aravindh Chithambaram, all ranked within the top 25, were knocked out by lower-rated opponents, and in every case, the decisive loss came with the White pieces.Who doesn't want to flaunt in front of the home crowd? The FIDE World Cup gave Indian players a chance. But were they ready?Playing at home brings comfort, support, and a very particular kind of pressure. A roaring crowd can uplift but also suffocate. Expectations aren’t spoken so much as felt.""Of course, it attracts so much pressure, but I think I would've to get into a mindset where it doesn't affect my chess,"" GM Pranesh M told TimesofIndia.com ahead of the FIDE World Cup.In a sport where calmness is oxygen, emotional wobble can flip a stable position into disaster. Hosting the event was a milestone for India, but also a weight not everyone carried equally well.Besides the title, branded as the Viswanathan Anand Trophy, three Candidates’ spots were up for grabs. With 206 participants, everyone had a realistic chance of making the Candidates.While the path is wider -- ratings, Grand Swiss, FIDE Circuit -- for top Indians, others saw the FIDE World Cup as their only way into the Candidates.Decades ago, World Championship qualification had one winding but clear pathway: nationals, zonals, inter-zonals, then Candidates""The world was divided into several zones, and if you played well in the interzonal championships, you would thereby qualify for the Candidates Tournament. So there was one single channel through which everybody could qualify,"" Veteran Grandmaster Pravin Thipsay told this website.""Today, if you look at it, there are at least 500 players strong enough to become surprise candidates and emerge into the last eight. At least 500 players are capable of doing that if they perform at their best.""But now we have various phases and various seedings. Some top players get seeded by rating, while others get seeded by virtue of playing in Grand Swiss tournaments, which are again restricted only to very strong players.""For many top Indians, having multiple routes to Candidates' qualification works as a safety net, whereas there is no such thing for others.""So a large number, five out of eight, qualify through these different channels, and only three players qualify through what may be called the proper channel… for a common player, this is the only channel. So one could say that the common player is more motivated in this particular tournament,"" the veteran Grandmaster added.And it was not as if Indians left the field without a fight; many showed that hunger. Diptayan Ghosh upset Ian Nepomniachtchi early, while Pranav V, SL Narayanan, and Harikrishna pushed deep into the field. But hunger is only one ingredient. Consistency in chaos is another.There is a growing concern in the Indian chess fraternity. With trainers and coaches more inclined towards AI and chess engines, the creativity on the board is somewhat evaporating.""Now everybody has the best engines and powerful hardware, so there’s very little that separates one player from another... Earlier, it wasn’t like that -- you had to sit for hours, work through lines, go deeper yourself. There was always a horizon effect; after a few moves, the engine stopped seeing clearly,"" Vidit Gujhrathi told TimesofIndia.com recently during an exclusive interview.""But today, with neural-network-based AI, engines give you answers immediately. So the barrier to learning openings has dropped significantly. And chess, by its nature, is a draw-ish game. If both sides play perfectly, the most likely result is a draw, maybe 51–49 either way.”And once a match enters a tie-break, it's anyone's game.""Are we really thinking about chess? Are we playing creative chess ourselves? Do we know where we end our preparation? Do we actually know what is to be done next?"" Thipsay asked.""Otherwise, this preparation has no value. And you end up playing to get a better position according to the engine. And you do not know what the plan is to be made. Those who are shrewd and intelligent enough to apply this policy of preparing well at the same time find out what is to be done next.""Both in the Women's World Cup and the Open section in Goa, those who put creativity over engines had the last laugh. It perhaps leaves a lesson for the future.And even if the Indian challenge faded in the air at the Goa World Cup, all hope is not lost, with R Praggnanandhaa closing in on securing the final Candidates spot available through the FIDE Circuit.For India, that would ensure at least one representation in the Candidates. The number could well have been more than one. But as they say, it's what it is.","Uzbekistan’s Javokhir Sindarov won the FIDE Chess World Cup 2025.

Coach Gautam Gambhir, chief selector Ajit Agarkar need to get their act right

Poll What do you believe is the primary issue with India's performance under Gambhir? Coaching strategy Player mentality Lack of experience

NEW DELHI: India's stunning 2-0 whitewash at the hands of South Africa in Guwahati on Wednesday has once again brought Gautam Gambhir 's role as head coach under intense scrutiny. This is the second time India have been blanked in a Test series under Gambhir, following last year's humiliating defeat in New Zealand. The latest setback has triggered sharp criticism from several former cricketers and experts, but none more dramatic and thought-provoking than AB de Villiers ' assessment of Gambhir's leadership style.Speaking on Ravichandran Ashwin 's YouTube channel, De Villiers offered a candid and layered view of Gambhir — one that balanced both concern and perspective. Drawing from his experience of playing against Gambhir for years, the South African great suggested that emotions may be at the heart of India's current coaching debate.“I don't know what GG is like when it comes to leadership,” he began. “I've known him as an emotional player, and if that is the case in the change room, generally an emotional coach is not a good thing to have.”The remark instantly struck a chord in the cricketing world, fuelling questions about whether Gambhir's intensity — once his greatest strength — is working against him in a dressing room that appears increasingly unsettled.However, De Villiers didn't stop at criticism. He made it equally clear that there is no fixed formula for a successful coach. “It's not to say he's that kind of a coach behind the scenes. There's no right and wrong. Some players feel comfortable with a former player, some with someone who's never played but has years of coaching experience.”He further admitted that he had never worked directly with Gambhir, Morne Morkel or Ryan ten Doeschate inside the Indian setup, making it difficult to fully judge the internal dynamics. But he contrasted the situation sharply with his admiration for South Africa's current head coach, Shukri Conrad, crediting him for restoring calm and clarity.“I absolutely loved playing under Gary Kirsten; he's a former player and similar to Gautam Gambhir,” ABD added. “Some players find confidence with a former great being there — someone who inspires you to put in extra yards.”As Team India reels from another home debacle, De Villiers' comments have added a dramatic edge to a debate that is unlikely to fade soon.",Gambhir under intense scrutiny after India's 2-0 whitewash at the hands of South Africa in Guwahati.

Australia second Ashes Test squad:

Steve Smith (c), Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Brendan Doggett, Cameron Green, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Michael Neser, Mitchell Starc, Jake Weatherald, Beau Webster

Australia have resisted the temptation to rush back their two premier fast bowlers, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, naming an unchanged 14-man squad for the second Ashes Test beginning Thursday at the Gabba. The decision means Cummins’ anticipated return will be delayed by another two weeks, while Hazlewood also remains unavailable as he continues his recovery from a hamstring strain.Cummins, who missed the first Test in Perth due to lumbar stress, trained impressively this week — bowling at full tilt with the pink ball at the SCG and completing long spells to skipper Steve Smith. Despite showing visible signs of improvement, selectors opted for caution, unwilling to risk their captain so early in the five-match series. He will travel with the squad to Brisbane but will target a comeback in the third Test in Adelaide starting December 17.Hazlewood, too, bowled during the week but was seen using a red ball rather than the pink used for the upcoming day-night clash, a clear indicator that his fitness timeline remains conservative.Coach Andrew McDonald has expressed optimism about his availability later in the series but ruled out any premature return.The decision keeps Queensland quick Brendan Doggett in prime position to retain his spot in the XI after a superb debut in Perth, where he claimed five wickets and impressed with his control and temperament.Veteran opener Usman Khawaja has been included in the squad but must prove his fitness after back spasms forced him to sit out Australia’s second innings in the opening Test. Travis Head, who blitzed the second-fastest century in Ashes history while filling in at the top, remains flexible about his batting position. McDonald hinted that Australia will reassess their batting order once Khawaja’s condition becomes clearer.Meanwhile, England have arrived in Brisbane but have surprisingly opted against pink-ball match practice, with only squad members Jacob Bethell, Matthew Potts and Josh Tongue set to feature against the Prime Minister’s XI. Ben Stokes’ men will begin training at the Gabba on Sunday as they attempt to level the series after Australia’s eight-wicket win in Perth.",Australia have named an unchanged 14-man squad for the second Ashes Test beginning Thursday at the Gabba.

Pakistan star batter Babar Azam endured a night to forget in Rawalpindi on Thursday, as he registered yet another duck — a moment that now places him alongside Umar Akmal and Saim Ayub for the most ducks by a Pakistani in T20 internationals. The 31-year-old was dismissed for a two-ball duck during Pakistan’s tense chase against Sri Lanka in the sixth match of the ongoing T20I tri-series.Chasing 185, Pakistan looked towards their premier batter for stability after early jolts. Instead, Babar walked back without scoring after Dushmantha Chameera trapped him plumb in front on the final ball of the fourth over. What made the moment even more striking was its historic weight: It was Babar’s 10th T20I duck, pulling him level with Umar Akmal and Saim Ayub atop Pakistan’s unwanted list.Globally, the unwanted list is led by Sri Lanka’s former captain Dasun Shanaka, who holds the all-time record with 15 T20I ducks. Six players sit on 13, while ex-India captain Rohit Sharma ended his career with 12.While Babar faltered, Sri Lanka delivered a statement win under high pressure.The visitors needed victory to reach the final and did exactly that, edging Pakistan by six runs in a thriller decided in the last over. Fast bowler Dushmantha Chameera was the star, claiming 4 for 20 and closing out the match by conceding just three runs when Pakistan required 10.Earlier, Sri Lanka posted 184/5, led by Kamil Mishra’s superb 76 off 48 and Kusal Mendis’ brisk 40. Pakistan’s chase was derailed early as Chameera ripped through the top order, leaving them reeling at 43/4. Captain Salman Ali Agha kept Pakistan alive with a career-best 63 off 44, assisted by handy contributions from Usman Khan (33) and Mohammad Nawaz (27), but the early collapse proved decisive.",Babar Azam dismissed for a two-ball duck during Pakistan’s tense chase against Sri Lanka in the sixth match of the ongoing T20I tri-series.

Inside India nets in Ranchi: How Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma prepared for first ODI vs South Africa

It’s all hotting up in cool Ranchi. The 0-2 Test series loss to South Africa already seems a distant memory as the mind-space of Indian cricket fans is set to be taken over by their beloved ‘Ro-Ko’ pairing. The clamour for tickets in MS Dhoni’s hometown is a clear indication of the pull that Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli still have. As India look to bounce back in the ODI series after the Test humiliation, all eyes will be on how Rohit and Virat — who now play only in one format — counter the South African attack on Sunday.The duo arrived in Ranchi a day ahead of their teammates and had joined the Indian camp for a full practice session at JSCA International Stadium on Friday itself. On Saturday afternoon though, both of them, along with most of the other first-team players, gave the optional training session a miss.Coming back from a long lay-off, Rohit and Virat had difficult starts to the Australia series last month before they got things right in Sydney. But at this stage of their careers, they know the scrutiny will always be there, especially when they are looking to play the ODI World Cup in Sept 2027 — still some distance away.Captain KL Rahul, though, threw his weight behind the two legends. In fact, he is banking on the duo to revive the confidence of the team that has taken a serious beating following their Test debacle.“Their importance at any point is huge. To have senior players in the team obviously makes the dressing room feel a lot more confident.Just having their presence and experience helps the players in the dressing room. We are really happy that they are here,” said Rahul.Meanwhile, Ruturaj Gaikwad was seen having long nets sessions on both days, an indication that he could be the No. 4 in place of injured Shreyas Iyer.At the pre-match media interaction, Rahul suggested Gaikwad was sure to get his chance in the series. “Rutu is a top-class player. With whatever limited opportunities he has got, he has shown what he can do. Unfortunately, in ODIs, the top five-six is quite settled and they are performing really well. So, you feel bad for the players who don’t get enough opportunities,” said the skipper.“I’m looking forward to giving him that chance and letting him show what he can do for the team. There’s never a question mark on his skill and how good a player he is. It’s just about the right opportunities and the right timing. Hopefully, this series gives him that opportunity,” added Rahul.Openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rahul batted against spinners Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja and Tilak Varma’s medium pace on Saturday as pacers Arshdeep Singh, Harshit Rana and Prasidh Krishna also gave the training a miss ahead of the opener.Rishabh Pant, who came back into the ODI squad after his foot injury, was missing from practice too. Unwilling to divulge any details about team selection, Rahul said, “He’s (Pant) been with the team for a long time. Everyone has seen what he brings to the table. But you will find out tomorrow who will be left behind. He’s good enough to play as a pure batter but if he’s in the XI, he will take the gloves and I will be in the field. ”As dew is going to play a major role in the day/night game, winning the toss will be a major factor. That might also give India some selection dilemma on whether to play Nitish Kumar Reddy as a pace-bowling all-rounder or bank on spinning all-rounder Washington Sundar ’s off-spin.Quinton de Kock ’s presence on top of the order will boost South Africa’s batting while Matthew Breetzke and Dewald Brevis could be crucial in the middle. Marco Jansen will hope to continue his all-round abilities shown in the Tests while Lungi Ngidi could lead the pace bowling charge for the Proteas.With only one 300-plus score in the previous six ODIs here, a score of around 280 looks par on a wicket which has behaved on the slower side. And teams have found it difficult to chase 270-280 under lights. So, batting the opposition out could well be the mantra for both captains, but bowling second could prove to be a challenging job with heavy dew playing a leading role.","Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli missed optional training session in Ranchi.

Pakistan secured victory in the Twenty20 tri-series final by defeating Sri Lanka with a six-wicket margin on Saturday.Sri Lanka's batting lineup collapsed dramatically, losing their final eight wickets for just 16 runs and getting bowled out for 114 in 19.1 overs.Pakistan successfully chased down the target, reaching 118-4 with eight balls remaining. The opening pair of Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan contributed 36 and 23 runs respectively, while Babar Azam remained unbeaten with 37 runs off 34 balls.Sri Lanka, despite winning their previous matches against Zimbabwe and Pakistan, struggled against Pakistan's spin attack. Mohammad Nawaz took 3-17, Abrar Ahmed claimed 2-18, and Ayub picked up 1-17.""It was a great performance from us. We have been doing well in both ODIs and T20Is … we are pretty much ready for the World Cup. We still have six games before the World Cup to try out things if we want but we are pretty much clear on our 15 players,"" Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha said.Sri Lanka, batting first, made a promising start reaching 81-1 at the halfway mark. However, they managed only one six against the spinners in the first 12 overs.Kamil Mishara impressed with 59 runs off 47 balls, forming a 64-run partnership with Kusal Mendis who scored 14.The Sri Lankan innings began to unravel when Babar took an impressive catch at long-off to dismiss Mendis off Nawaz's bowling in the 11th over.Mishara, who reached his fifty in 37 balls, fell to another spectacular catch by Babar. Sri Lanka's situation worsened as they lost more wickets quickly.Ahmed struck twice in one over, while Babar continued his brilliant fielding by catching Pavan Rathnayake. Kusal Perera's poor form continued as he managed only 1 run.Nawaz emerged as the tournament's leading wicket-taker with 10 wickets, dismissing both Janith Liyanage and Wanindu Hasaranga. Shaheen Shah Afridi wrapped up the innings with 3-18.""It is important to deliver when the team requires you. I plan with the coaches and try to keep it simple because, as a finger-spinner, you don't have many options so I try to read the game and bowl accordingly,"" Nawaz said.During Pakistan's chase, Ayub attacked Maheesh Theekshana in the powerplay, hitting three boundaries in one over. Farhan followed with aggressive batting against Hasaranga.Despite Rathnayake dismissing Agha and Fakhar Zaman in consecutive overs, Babar maintained his composure and secured the win with a boundary.","Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by six wickets in Twenty20 tri-series final.

The Punjab Cricket Association will unveil two new stands in honour of India captain Harmanpreet Kaur and former all-rounder Yuvraj Singh during the fourth T20I between India and South Africa in Mullanpur on December 11. Officiating PCA Secretary Siddhant Sharma confirmed the decision, calling it a tribute to two of Punjab’s most influential cricketers.Ahead of the match at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium, Harmanpreet — who recently led India to a historic ICC Women’s World Cup triumph in Navi Mumbai on November 2 — will have a stand inaugurated in her name.

IPL 2026 retained players: Who stayed where and for how much

Faf du Plessis' post on Instagram

Former South Africa captain and long-time IPL stalwart Faf du Plessis has confirmed he will not enter his name in the upcoming IPL auction, choosing instead to participate in the Pakistan Super League.The announcement came on Sunday, 29 November — barely two weeks before the 15 December auction in Abu Dhabi, thereby marking a notable shift for one of the most reliable overseas performers the IPL has seen.Du Plessis, who first joined Chennai Super Kings in 2013, became part of the franchise’s core almost instantly, admired for his consistency, athleticism and composure in high-pressure games.He spent seven seasons with CSK and reunited with MS Dhoni during the Rising Pune Supergiant stint in 2016 and 2017. His finest IPL campaign arrived during CSK’s title run in 2021, scoring 633 runs and finishing just 2 runs behind Ruturaj Gaikwad in the Orange Cap tally.Yet, CSK released him before the 2022 mega auction, allowing Royal Challengers Bengaluru to sign him and hand him the captaincy for the 2022–24 seasons.He thrived in the role. His 730-run effort in 2023 remains among the standout seasons by an RCB captain. In 2025, he turned out for Delhi Capitals, scoring 202 runs in nine matches before injury cut his tournament short.Across 14 seasons, du Plessis built an IPL record few overseas players can match: 4,773 runs in 154 matches at an average of 35.10 and a strike rate of 135.79.“After 14 seasons in the IPL, I’ve decided not to put my name into the auction this year,” he wrote, thanking franchises, teammates and fans for shaping his journey. He stressed this decision is not a farewell to India, saying, “India has a special place in my heart… this certainly isn’t goodbye.”Du Plessis will now shift his focus to the PSL, where he previously represented Peshawar Zalmi and Quetta Gladiators. “A new country. A new environment. A new challenge,” he said, looking forward to the return.","Faf du Plessis has pulled out of the IPL auction ahead of the 2026 season.

Harbhajan Singh's earlier tweet

Poll Should India stop preparing dry, turning pitches for Test matches? Yes, we need better pitches No, turning pitches benefit spinners It depends on the team's strategy

Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh delivered a blunt assessment of the team’s spin resources and the pitches used in the recent home Test series, insisting that India currently lack a specialist right-arm off-spinner suited for the format.Speaking to PTI on Friday, Harbhajan said the 2-0 defeat to South Africa exposed deeper structural issues in India’s bowling plans and pitch preparation.“Looks like (India does not have a specialist right-arm off-spinner for Test cricket),” Harbhajan told PTI, pointing out that the Proteas dominated India’s spinners. He said Washington Sundar remains the closest option in the current setup but needs far more workload to evolve.“I think Washington Sundar is there, but we will have to bowl him more. He will have to be bowled for 30-35 overs in a Test match to make a bowler out of him,” he said.Harbhajan argued that India’s long-standing habit of preparing dry, turning tracks is stunting the growth of both batters and spinners. “The kind of pitches we have been playing on, there is no requirement of making a bowler out of anyone because every delivery spins or some straightens,” he said.“A bowler can (only) be considered good when he takes wickets on good pitches.”Calling for an immediate shift in approach, he said India’s red-ball cricket has been “stuck at one place” for more than a decade. “We should play on good cricket pitches — it is high time,” Harbhajan said, adding that quality surfaces are essential if India want their batters to develop the ability to score big at home, the way they did during the England tour where Shubman Gill amassed 754 runs.Harbhajan criticised the recent turners, particularly the Eden Gardens surface that saw the first Test against South Africa end inside three days, prompting him to post “#RIPTESTCRICKET” on social media. “We keep on talking about saving and promoting Test cricket, but this is not the way to save Test cricket,” he said. “If you want to save Test cricket then we need to start playing on good tracks, which allow your bowlers and batters and everyone to be in the game. ”The former spinner said India must look in the mirror and move away from surfaces that reduce Test cricket to a lottery, rather than a contest of skill.","Harbhajan Singh says India need a specialist right-arm off-spinner for Test cricket.

How Ajit Agarkar is letting Indian cricket down

Poll How do you view the intensity of the India-Pakistan cricket rivalry? It's the biggest sporting event. Comparable to football World Cup. Not as huge as the FIFA World Cup

Pakistan batter Babar Azam opened up on the moments he treasures most as captain and the opponents who shaped his cricketing growth during a candid conversation with Kevin Pietersen on ""The Switch | Kevin Pietersen"".The former skipper said nothing comes close to the match Pakistan finally broke their World Cup jinx against India in Dubai in 2021.Asked by Pietersen about his proudest achievements as captain, Babar didn’t hesitate.“It means a lot for me, I think, India… So when we are beating India in T20. I think, for me, one of the best. First time, as a Pakistani captain, I beat India in the World Cup. Yeah, it's a very, very big thing,” he said. Pietersen agreed instantly, calling India–Pakistan contests “the biggest sporting event in the world,” bigger even than a football World Cup final in sheer impact.Babar said the magnitude of that win — Pakistan’s first over India in a men’s World Cup — remains unmatched in his career.The 2021 fixture, where Babar and Mohammad Rizwan chased down 152 without losing a wicket, became a defining landmark for Pakistan cricket.Babar’s calm 68* and Rizwan’s unbeaten 79 dismantled India in a 10-wicket victory, setting the tone for Pakistan’s run to the semifinals. It remains one of the most emphatic results in the history of the rivalry across formats.Babar also spoke about the lessons he has absorbed from the modern greats he has faced. He revealed he routinely seeks out opposition stars after matches to understand how they think and train. “When we have a match… after the match, I ask him in the match. I need your time after the match,” he told Pietersen, confirming he has spoken to Joe Root, Kane Williamson, Steve Smith and even India's Virat Kohli.Asked what those conversations cover, Babar said the focus is always on preparation and mental discipline. “You know, mindset… focus and working hard. How many balls he's playing in the day… when he's batting in the nets, how focus in the batting time. The same mindset you take in the match or practice or different. So they give me good, you know, tips.”For Babar, the joy lies not only in the achievements but in learning from the best — though nothing, he stressed, matches the night Pakistan finally beat India on one of the biggest stages.","Babar Azam recalls Pakistan's T20 World Cup win over India as one of his proudest moments as captain.

The legacy of Brazilian football icon Pelé has taken a significant step toward renewed global visibility following the acquisition of his brand by NR Sports, the company owned by Neymar Santos Sr. The announcement was made on Tuesday at the Pelé Museum in Santos, the coastal city where the legendary forward built much of his career and global reputation.Neymar Sr. described the agreement as a milestone for both his company and Brazilian sport, emphasizing the cultural power attached to Pelé’s image.“It’s a very strong brand.

Cristiano Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez have set the stage for what is expected to be one of the most high-profile weddings in recent years, with the couple reportedly choosing a venue that carries deep personal meaning for the Portugal captain. Instead of the grand international locations often associated with celebrity weddings, Ronaldo has opted to return to his roots in Madeira, selecting a site that reflects both history and identity.Portuguese outlets report that the ceremony is planned at Funchal Cathedral, widely recognised as the island’s oldest and most significant religious building. The structure, inaugurated in 1514 and built with local cedar wood, stands as a landmark of Madeira’s cultural heritage. It also sits just a short distance from the hospital where Ronaldo was born, adding a layer of symbolism to the decision.The connection between Ronaldo and his birthplace has remained evident throughout his career. Madeira’s international airport carries his name, and his museum — dedicated to his achievements — is located on the island. His early football steps with Nacional da Madeira unfolded not far from the cathedral selected for the ceremony.As per outlets in the country, the gathering is likely to be intimate in nature, though it will bring together guests linked to Ronaldo’s life in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Saudi Arabia and across the football world. Further details remain unconfirmed.It is also stated in a Jornal da Madeira report that Ronaldo and his fiancée will tie the knot in a Christian ceremony in the summer of 2026.Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez began their relationship in 2016 after meeting in Madrid, where she worked at a Gucci store during his time at Real Madrid. Over nine years, the couple have navigated different countries and stages of his career. They share two daughters, Alana and Bella, while raising Cristiano Jr, Mateo and Eva María together.As Ronaldo prepares for a demanding period with club and country — including a busy summer of international fixtures — Georgina continues to build her presence as an entrepreneur and media figure.For Madeira, the wedding marks another moment tied to one of its biggest icons. For Ronaldo, it reflects a return to the island that shaped his earliest years, setting the backdrop for a personal milestone that extends beyond football.","Cristiano Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez have reportedly chosen the venue for their wedding.

Izzy Nix embraces Auburn roots with nostalgic cheer gear as Alabama clash sends fans into frenzy

Bo Nix and Izzy Nix have become one of the most charming sports couples in today’s football world, and moments like this week’s Iron Bowl excitement show exactly why. The spotlight turned to Izzy as Auburn prepared to face Alabama, and fans got a sentimental and spirited flashback that brought their origin story right back into the conversation. She lit up social media with that nostalgic cheerleader photo, a nod to the place where their journey began, and fans of both college and pro ball took notice.Their story stretches back to when Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix met his wife Izzy Nix when he was a quarterback for the Auburn Tigers and she was a cheerleader there. Those Auburn years built their bond. As Bo led the Tigers from 2019 to 2021, he and Izzy Smoke were not just a couple but a recognizable presence around campus. The relationship deepened with an unforgettable moment when he’d propose to her at Auburn’s football field, Jordan-Hare Stadium. Soon after, she joined him in Oregon, they married in Alabama in 2022, and the partnership stayed unbroken across states and uniforms.Now, with the Broncos and a new life in Denver, Izzy remains part of the story. Pregnant with their first child, she still brings an energetic edge with her gameday looks.Fans especially love her effortless cowgirl style and the loud-and-proud custom “10” gear that matches Bo’s jersey number. Saturdays are for Auburn, Sundays for Broncos. That rhythm continued this week. While the Broncos prepare to face the Washington Commanders under primetime lights, Saturday was pure Auburn in the Nix household. At kickoff she wrote, “happy iron bowl 🧡 beat bama !!!!!!” as the throwback photo landed like a spark.On the field, Auburn is chasing history. The Tigers have not beaten Alabama since the thrilling duel in 2019. They are aiming to spoil the Crimson Tide’s postseason hopes, especially since Alabama endured its only SEC defeat of the season against Oklahoma two weeks ago. Confidence is building on both sides, with Alabama’s 56-0 blowout of Eastern Illinois and Auburn’s strong rebound against Mercer setting up a meeting packed with emotion.For Bo and Izzy, though, the Iron Bowl is more than a rivalry. It is where their story began and each year, it brings them back to the roots of everything that followed.Also Read: The Ohio State jersey moment Tom Brady wishes never happened and how Mike Vrabel made him pay up","Izzy Nix embraced Auburn roots with nostalgic cheer gear as Alabama clash sends fans into frenzy.

Michigan vs Ohio State rivalry and Tom Brady’s message of toughness



Tom Brady’s connection to Michigan football never feels like nostalgia. It feels alive. This year’s Michigan vs Ohio State showdown, long known as “The Game,” carried pressure that only those who’ve lived it can understand. So when Brady appeared on Big Noon Kickoff, he didn’t come as a retired legend. He came as someone who still feels every heartbeat of this rivalry. And what he shared wasn’t a soft memory. It was a raw slice of truth about pride, pain and the power of tough experiences.Brady recalled being forced into an Ohio State jersey after losing a bet to his former teammate Mike Vrabel. The moment wasn’t funny to him then, and it still carries emotional weight now. “Okay, it was the ugliest jersey I’ve ever put on,” Brady said with a laugh. “And coincidentally, the day that I wore it to practice, that was the worst day of practice I’ve ever had in my life. That’s not a coincidence. That color did not treat me well. ”This rivalry has always been personal for Brady. In 1999, during his final Michigan season, he delivered a defining moment in the matchup with a late drive featuring that decisive touchdown pass.He didn’t take the credit even now. “The offensive line was giving me tons of time to stand back there,” he said. “I just had a granite wall and I could sit back there and pick apart those Buckeyes.”That mix of humility and competitiveness forms the backbone of his message to current players. He tells them that pressure should be welcomed, not feared. “When I get a chance to talk to a lot of college athletes, I say, ‘I hope this experience is hard for you. I hope it's not easy,’” Brady said. “Life is hard. The challenges of life are hard. This program is hard. It's built on toughness. It's built on resilience. That's what I want to see from this team today. ”For Michigan, the stakes were enormous. They entered the game with a chance to stay alive in the Big Ten title picture and keep their College Football Playoff hopes breathing. Winning would mark a fifth straight triumph over Ohio State, something the program hadn’t achieved in nearly a century. Brady believes these difficult tests are what bond players to the tradition and to each other.Brady’s story is more than a lighthearted recollection about an ugly jersey. It’s a lesson about identity. Michigan football, at its core, is about grit, accountability and elevating under pressure. Whether wearing maize and blue or hoisting Lombardi trophies, Brady carries that standard forward.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes channels heavenly white and soft glam, creating a stunning Thanksgiving aesthetic everyone’s talking about","Tom Brady recalls being forced into an Ohio State jersey after losing a bet.

Every detail-- from the copper-colored plates to the orange florals on the table-- reflected her ability to balance elegance with heart. In her presence, Thanksgiving wasn’t just a holiday; it became a feeling you could almost reach through the screen.The family’s Thanksgiving took place in Texas after the Kansas City Chiefs lost to the Dallas Cowboys 31 to 28 on November 28. Despite the close loss, the day turned joyful with family, food and laughter.Brittany shared the sweet sentiment with fans, saying, “Getting to spend Thanksgiving with all our family in TX this year is so special,” offering a peek at a table dressed in copper plates, mustard goblets, red napkins and orange florals on white linen.Earlier that day, Brittany showed off a different look for the game. She wore a long-sleeve white blouse with striking red leather pants and fun space buns. Watching from a private suite, she kept company with her and Patrick’s children Sterling, Bronze and Golden. Bronze turned three shortly after, and Brittany marked the milestone by writing, “Happy Birthday to my little dude! The smartest yet very wild and hilarious kid you will ever meet. ” Her message continued with pure affection, promising love that lasts forever.The photos from Thanksgiving showed the whole family relaxed under a tree, dressed in neutrals and earthy tones that matched the fall mood. With the holiday now past, Patrick turns toward the Chiefs’ playoff push, saying, “You’ve got to win every game now and hope that’s enough.” His mindset reflects determination, but the Thanksgiving images remind fans of something sports cannot overshadow: home, family and gratitude.Also Read: Cowboys star George Pickens deletes shocking Brittany Mahomes post, igniting explosive drama before Thanksgiving showdown","Brittany Mahomes was the undisputed star of the day.

IPL 2026 retained players: Who stayed where and for how much

The spin dilemma after Bishnoi



The choices available are:



Wanindu Hasaranga, the marquee spin all-rounder who also strengthens the lower order

Rahul Chahar, a defensive spinner who can complement Rathi

Michael Bracewell or Sikandar Raza, if LSG want batting cushion plus overs

A bowling attack built on hope, not certainty



the worst powerplay economy

the worst middle-overs economy

the fourth-worst death-overs economy

no overseas seamers

no overseas spinners

Why the all-rounder slot is crucial



LSG likely XI: Aiden Markram, Mitchell Marsh, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh Pant, Overseas batter, Ayush Badoni, Abdul Samad, Digvesh Rathi, Mohammed Shami, Avesh Khan, Mayank Yadav / Mohsin Khan

Impact Player: A spinner

In their four-year journey as an IPL franchise, Lucknow Super Giants have rarely been shy about bold decisions. Last year’s Rs 27 crore splurge on Rishabh Pant rewrote auction history, but it also underlined a deeper truth about this team: LSG live on big swings, big bets and big risks. Some pay off handsomely, others end up burning holes in their season.As LSG head into the IPL 2026 Auction with Rs 22.95 crore purse, they are entering a tricky stage of building their squad. They have released two key players at the same time. David Miller ’s exit has left a clear gap in the finishing role, while letting go of Ravi Bishnoi has created a big hole in their spin attack.Even though LSG finished seventh last season, this is not a team in ruins. It is a team with an elite ceiling but brittle execution.If there was a redeeming story in LSG’s 2025 season, it would be their top three batters. Aiden Markram , Mitchell Marsh and Nicholas Pooran were among the most consistent cores in the league.Markram scored 445 runs at a strike rate of nearly 150 and chipped in with handy off-breaks. Marsh hit the franchise’s most runs in the season, crossing 600 runs at 163. Pooran, despite retiring internationally, is still one of the best in T20s and delivered a blistering 500-run season at a strike rate touching 200.Their top three did the heavy lifting in every match. The problem was everything that followed.Rishabh Pant’s signing was expected to transform Lucknow’s batting depth, but he endured the worst campaign of his career by a long distance. His 269 runs at a strike rate of 133 were flattering only because of a final-game 118 not out against RCB. For most of the season, he looked short of rhythm, confidence and intent.David Miller, brought in as the specialist finisher, did not make the impact LSG had hoped for. With him gone and Pant unreliable, the middle order unravelled repeatedly. Badoni remains inconsistent, while Samad is still learning the art of situational batting.This is why LSG entered the auction with their biggest requirement being two middle-order batters — ideally one overseas hitter and one Indian stabiliser. Liam Livingstone seems to be the best option available for them this auction. Abhinav Manohar can also be a domestic lower-order batter they can look at.Releasing Ravi Bishnoi was a surprise. A young, elite Indian leg-spinner is gold dust in the IPL. His exit forces LSG to rebuild an entirely new spin pairing around Digvesh Rathi, who had a promising debut season but will need support. Markram can offer some off-spin, but they still require a frontline partner for Rathi.LSG’s biggest vulnerability last year was the bowling across all phases. They had:They also took the second-fewest wickets with the new ball and the third-fewest in the middle overs.And yet — little has changed.Mohammad Shami has been traded in, bringing experience and new-ball skill. He is coming off a good domestic season, but given his age, he is no longer a guaranteed 14-match workhorse. Mayank Yadav and Mohsin Khan have again been retained, which reflects faith but also stubbornness. Both have missed the majority of the last two seasons with injury. Prince Yadav, Akash Singh and Siddharth M remain backups.At this point, LSG are betting on the returns of injury-prone bowlers rather than reinforcing the attack. It is a dangerous gamble.They still have:They may need at least one overseas quick, and someone like Mustafizur Rahman is a perfect fit for them. The Ekana pitch assists cutters and grip, and Fizz’s left-arm angle would add much-needed variety.LSG’s combination forces them to play an entirely Indian bowling attack, with four overseas slots consumed by Markram, Marsh, Pooran and the incoming middle-order signing. This is rare in the IPL and puts enormous pressure on domestic bowlers.If they choose to sacrifice an overseas middle-order batter, then a player like Hasaranga suddenly becomes priceless. He offers quality spin, lower-order hitting and flexibility. Alternatively, they could invest in overseas bowlers such as Mustafizur, Matt Henry, Jacob Duffy, Gerald Coetzee or Fazalhaq Farooqi.LSG enter the IPL Auction 2026 with a squad that has world-class top-order power but a fragile middle and lower-middle structure. Their bowling attack is long on names but short on reliability, with major injury concerns.Yet this team has a high ceiling. A few correct buys — one overseas middle-order hitter, one spinner and one Indian finisher — and suddenly they look like contenders again.","Lucknow Super Giants are entering a tricky stage of building their squad.

Ryan ten Doeschate backs under-fire Suryakumar Yadav, Shubman Gill to regain form

Former India cricketer Irfan Pathan said Shubman Gill is under pressure because of his recent poor form in T20Is. Pathan said Gill needs to score runs to secure his place in the T20I team, with the World Cup approaching and Sanju Samson waiting for an opportunity in the playing XI.Gill has not scored runs in the first two matches of the ongoing five-match T20 series against South Africa. He made four in the first T20I and was dismissed for a first-ball duck in the second match.""The main topic is of Shubman Gill. He is the vice-captain, and the World Cup is nearing. But runs are not coming, and he is struggling for form. He must make runs if he is to cement his spot in the T20I side, else he will be more under pressure. Gill got out for a first-ball duck in the second T20I, but it's not his game to step out and play as he did in the first match. Whenever he doesn't make runs, the pressure will pile on because Sanju Samson is currently benched,"" Irfan Pathan said on his YouTube Channel.Pathan said that if India have decided to back Gill for the World Cup, he must score, otherwise it will affect the team’s starts in the powerplay.""If Sanju Samson is brought into the side and doesn't make runs, then India will be in a catch-22 situation.But if India are backing Shubman Gill for the World Cup, it's critical for him to make runs. If it doesn't, it will hurt India due to the good start they might not get. Secondly, Gill will find himself under constant pressure because he is part of the leadership group,"" he said.Pathan said Samson should stay prepared because the team management may turn to him if Gill continues to struggle. He added that Gill will score if he follows his natural game.""Hence, Samson should also be mentally ready. I will say it again that Gill will score runs if he sticks to his own game plan. If he keeps thinking that there's another player waiting, it will be trouble. The team management's role will be important then,"" Pathan concluded.Gill’s recent numbers have been below his usual standards. He has made 263 runs in his last 14 T20I innings, averaging 23.90 with a strike rate of 142.93. Samson, who has been on the bench, has performed better as an opener, scoring 522 runs at a strike rate of 180 in 17 innings.Samson also has strong recent T20I performances as an opener, including back-to-back centuries against Bangladesh in Hyderabad (October last year) and South Africa in Durban (November last year). He is the only Indian opener to achieve this.",Former India cricketer Irfan Pathan says Shubman Gill is under pressure. Pathan said Gill needs to score runs to secure his place in the T20I team.

NEW DELHI: India’s opening match of the U19 Asia Cup 2025 turned into a showcase of dominance, power-hitting, and athletic brilliance, capped by a flying catch from Vaibhav Sooryavanshi that matched the authority of his record-shattering 171 on Friday.The moment arrived in the 38th over of UAE’s chase, when Prithvi Madhu, battling to keep the innings alive, miscued a lofted stroke off Vihaan Malhotra.Sooryavanshi, stationed in the deep, sprinted across and launched himself full-length to pouch a sharp, dying chance.Watch:The dismissal ended Madhu’s patient 50 off 87 balls and put a seal on India’s overwhelming 234-run victory.Earlier, it was Sooryavanshi’s bat that ripped the game open.

PBKS auction budget: INR 11.50 crore

Punjab Kings (PBLS) head coach Ricky Ponting explained why the team released Glenn Maxwell ahead of the IPL 2026 auction. Punjab Kings also released Aaron Hardie and Josh Inglis before the auction on December 16.Ponting spoke on JioStar's 'Retention Show' and said the overseas releases were planned to free up slots for the auction. He said the team values Maxwell but does not see him in the starting XI for the next season.""The biggest name we are releasing this year is Glenn Maxwell. I have worked with Glenn a long time. I love him and what he brings to the game. Unfortunately, last year we could not get the best out of him, and looking ahead we did not feel he would be in our starting team, so we decided to release him. Aaron Hardie is the other overseas all-rounder we are releasing. He never got a chance to play for us last year. It is hard to let such players go, but we need to open up overseas slots for the auction. Unfortunately, Aaron Hardie is a release,"" Ponting said, as cited by news agency ANI.Ponting said Hardie was released for strategic reasons. He said Inglis was let go because of limited availability for the upcoming season despite performing well late in the last tournament.""Josh Inglis is another one. He played some great knocks for us in the second half of the tournament. He missed a few games for different reasons and was also aware he would not be available for most of the tournament this year,"" the former Australia captain said.Former India player Anil Kumble said Punjab Kings have kept a settled squad after the releases and are helped by the confidence of finishing as runners-up last season. He said their Indian core did well and should continue to perform. Kumble said the team may aim to add backup fast bowlers, look at uncapped Indian players, and fill an overseas slot, possibly with a wicketkeeper-batter to replace Inglis.""Punjab Kings have all bases covered. They were the finalists last season, so that confidence has led them to keep most of their players. Their Indian players did exceptionally well last season, and they will hope that continues. Fast bowlers are always good to have as backup, so that is one area they could look at. They would have also identified a few talented uncapped Indians to consider. They will want to fill an overseas slot, as they have released three overseas players. They could look for a wicketkeeper-batter to fill Josh Inglis' position,"" Kumble said, as quoted by ANI.","Punjab Kings released Glenn Maxwell, Josh Inglis, Aaron Hardie and Kuldeep Sen.

She repeated that her husband stays away from such behaviour despite the atmosphere around him.“My husband, the cricketer Ravindra Jadeja, has to travel to many countries like London, Dubai and Australia to play cricket. Despite this, to this day, he has never touched or engaged in any kind of vice, because he understands his responsibilities.

Without this change, no sustainable league structure can be built, regardless of good intentions,"" the letter stated.The AIFF responded to the clubs' letter, noting that their options are limited due to the matter being before the Supreme Court.""As the matter is currently sub judice before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, and with the report already submitted by Justice L. N. Rao to the Court, our options remain limited,"" AIFF deputy secretary general K Satyanarayan wrote in his reply.""At present, there are two possible approaches: 1. To await the final directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court; or 2. To collectively explore an amicable alternative solution.""Mohun Bagan Super Giant director Vinay Chopra, writing on behalf of all clubs, expressed their readiness to operate and develop the league, writing:""The time for procedural exchanges, meetings without purpose, and administrative delay has expired... such a meeting must have clear, time-bound decisions, not reiterating constraints that have been known for months.""The stakes are existential... Indian football faces the genuine risk of losing its only professional league, investors, sponsors, and the confidence of fans. Time is rapidly running out.""The AIFF's suggestion to discuss the consortium proposal at the AGM has met with opposition from Executive Committee members.AIFF Executive Committee member Avijit Paul expressed concern about bypassing proper procedures, penning: ""The Exco is the highest decision-making body in the AIFF, and to bypass it in any form is against the rules and regulations and the constitution of the AIFF... The issue is highly sensitive in nature and is related to the long-time financial health of the AIFF.""""It is hugely disappointing that you have decided to jump the gun and enter into a dialogue in this regard by keeping Exco and General Body in the complete dark,"" Paul wrote to Satyanarayan.Women's Committee chairperson Valanka Alemao questioned the authority behind these proposals.""In the light of...Constitutional provision, no private entity can be permitted to organise the league. So how can there be a possibility for the 'AIFF to explore the possibility under which ISL clubs may collectively form a consortium',"" Valanka wrote.""No such item is on the AGM agenda either. With football coming to a standstill, the federation is being seen in very poor light by all and sundry. The Executive Committee needs an explanation from you regarding your intentions in trying to provide avenues which breach Constitutional provisions.""","Twelve Indian Super League clubs have approached the All India Football Federation with a request to modify what they call ""commercially restrictive"" clauses in its constitution. This request was made ahead of the Annual General Meeting (AGM) scheduled for December 20.

Arsenal secured a dominant 3-0 victory against Club Brugge in the Champions League on Wednesday, with Noni Madueke and Gabriel Martinelli scoring spectacular goals, helping Arsenal maintain their perfect record of six wins in six matches and virtually assuring automatic qualification to the last 16.Madueke, the former Chelsea winger, opened the scoring with a powerful long-range strike in the first half and added his second with a close-range header after the break. Martinelli sealed the win with a curling right-footed shot from outside the box.The comprehensive victory puts Arsenal at the top of their Champions League group with 18 points, nearly guaranteeing a top-eight finish with two games remaining.

The match also marked Ivan Leko's return as Brugge manager after Nicky Hayen's dismissal on Monday.Arteta made five changes to his lineup, including starts for Norgaard at center back and Viktor Gyokeres, who hadn't started since November 1.Arsenal nearly took the lead when Piero Hincapie deflected Myles Lewis-Skelly's shot onto the post midway through the first half. Minutes later, Madueke broke the deadlock with his spectacular strike from the right side of Arsenal's attack.While Brugge showed occasional threat through Carlos Forbs on the right wing, Arsenal maintained control. Brugge's Aleksandar Stankovic and Christos Tzolis tested goalkeeper David Raya before halftime.Madueke extended Arsenal's lead early in the second half, heading in Martin Zubimendi's cross. Martinelli, who has played a limited role this season, added the third goal in the 56th minute.The match concluded with Arsenal substitute Gabriel Jesus, returning after an 11-month absence, hitting the crossbar as the visitors continued to press for more goals.The Premier League leaders, who have never won the European championship, demonstrated their strength despite missing several key players through injury.

Poll Should Xabi Alonso be given more time to turn Real Madrid’s fortunes around? Yes, he deserves support No, it's time for a change Only if results improve quickly

Manchester City delivered a dramatic comeback to beat Real Madrid 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday, a result that has pushed Xabi Alonso closer to the brink amid growing uncertainty over his future. Despite taking an early lead, Madrid’s frailties resurfaced and Pep Guardiola’s side capitalised, leaving the Spanish giants facing both a Champions League struggle and a coaching dilemma.Madrid, missing injured superstar Kylian Mbappe, began brightly and struck first through Rodrygo Goes, who ended a draining 33-game goal drought. The Brazilian finished a flowing counter-attack initiated by Alvaro Carreras, drilling low past Gianluigi Donnarumma after being played through by Jude Bellingham. Rodrygo’s celebration — embracing Alonso on the touchline — was a pointed show of support during what he later called “a difficult moment” for the squad and its manager.But the momentum flipped abruptly. City equalised in the 35th minute after Thibaut Courtois spilled Josko Gvardiol’s header, allowing Nico O’Reilly to pounce and tap home. The error punctured Madrid’s early rhythm, and frustration inside the Bernabeu grew as whistles rang out during a disjointed second half.City then struck again just before halftime. Antonio Rudiger hauled Erling Haaland to the ground inside the box, and the Norwegian made no mistake from the spot, sending Courtois the wrong way to give City a 2-1 lead they would protect until the end.Madrid continued to press for an equaliser but produced few clear openings. Courtois redeemed himself with sharp stops to deny Haaland, Rayan Cherki, and later Jeremy Doku, but the hosts lacked creativity and conviction. Alonso introduced 19-year-old Endrick late on, and the youngster nearly rescued a point when his effort clipped the crossbar with minutes remaining.Spanish media had widely reported that defeat would all but seal Alonso’s dismissal, and the atmosphere reflected those stakes. Madrid have now won just two of their last eight matches across competitions, slipping dangerously in the Champions League league-phase standings.Guardiola admitted City were second-best early on but praised his side’s resilience: “Until the goal we scored, they were much better.”Defender Raul Asencio insisted the dressing room remains behind Alonso, but with President Florentino Perez monitoring closely, Madrid could be headed for yet another change in the dugout.","Manchester City beat Real Madrid 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday.

Jim Harbaugh reacts to Moore’s arrest and firing



Sherrone Moore’s rise to the top of Michigan football was swift, but it came to a shocking halt this week. Moore, promoted to head coach in 2024 after Jim Harbaugh returned to the NFL, was dismissed on Wednesday following allegations of an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Athletic director Warde Manuel confirmed that “credible evidence was found that Coach Moore engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a staff member,” prompting his immediate termination. Moore, 39, had been a fixture in Ann Arbor for six years, serving as tight ends coach, offensive line coach, and offensive coordinator under Harbaugh from 2018 to 2023.The situation escalated quickly after Moore’s firing. He was arrested later that day and arraigned on Friday, facing felony home invasion charges along with misdemeanors for stalking in a domestic relationship and breaking and entering. Authorities allege Moore entered the home “of a victim with whom Mr. Moore had a dating relationship” without permission, engaging in a heated verbal argument that included threats of self-harm. Pittsfield police reported that Moore was detained without incident and briefly treated at a local hospital before being held at the county jail.Harbaugh, now the head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers, responded to questions about Moore during a media session on Friday.“Chad Jessop told me, one of our equipment guys, when we were coming off the field on Thursday,” Harbaugh said. “So I'm still processing that like a lot of people.” His measured response reflects the close professional and personal bond he shared with Moore, who was his trusted assistant and eventual successor at Michigan.Moore had been a key part of Michigan’s coaching success. He joined Harbaugh’s staff in 2018 as tight ends coach, became co-offensive coordinator in 2021, and took full play-calling responsibilities in 2023. That same year, he stepped in as acting head coach during Harbaugh’s three-game suspension linked to the Big Ten’s sign-stealing investigation. Together, Harbaugh and Moore guided Michigan to a flawless 15-0 record, culminating in a national championship victory over Washington.Following Moore’s dismissal, former Harbaugh assistant Biff Poggi will serve as interim head coach for the Citrus Bowl against Texas. Moore leaves behind a 15-8 record across two seasons as Michigan’s head coach and a complex legacy, shaped by on-field success and off-field controversies.Also Read: Adam Schefter sparks outrage after ‘shameful’ defense of Sherrone Moore amid explosive scandal and shocking arrest fallout","Sherrone Moore was fired by Michigan on Wednesday following allegations of an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.

Christian McCaffrey injury update: Will the 49ers star push through illness to play Titans in Week 15?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/christian-mccaffrey-injury-update-will-the-49ers-star-push-through-illness-to-play-titans-in-week-15/articleshow/125942889.cms,"Will Christian McCaffrey play in Week 15? (AP Photos)

Will Christian McCaffrey play in Week 15?



Christian McCaffrey’s week began with uncertainty, but it ended with clarity and quiet confidence inside the 49ers’ facility. After an illness briefly slowed him down, San Francisco’s offensive engine was back at full speed by Friday, taking every rep as the team prepared for its Week 15 clash against the Tennessee Titans. In December football, availability often matters as much as talent, and McCaffrey checked both boxes at the perfect time.The timing could not be better for a 49ers team that understands how thin the margin can be in the NFC playoff race. San Francisco enters the weekend riding a three-game winning streak, refreshed after a bye, and holding a 9-4 record. Yet the standings remain unforgiving. With both the Rams and Seahawks sitting at 10-3, every snap carries weight. Against a struggling Titans team, the 49ers know complacency is not an option.Christian McCaffrey’s return to full practice immediately stabilizes San Francisco’s offensive plans for Week 15. When he is on the field, the 49ers operate with a rare balance that few defenses can solve. McCaffrey’s numbers tell a story of consistency and volume. He has already logged 849 rushing yards and eight touchdowns while adding 806 receiving yards and five more scores through the air.That dual threat keeps defensive coordinators guessing and opens space for everyone else.Just as important is his reliability. After appearing in only four games last season, McCaffrey has not missed a single contest in 2025. At 29, he is closing in on another milestone, sitting 151 rushing yards away from his fifth career 1,000-yard season with four games left. San Francisco’s staff has a reputation for protecting its stars late in the year, but signs point to McCaffrey playing with minimal restrictions. Depth options are in place, yet his presence remains central.The matchup also favors him. Tennessee enters Week 15 ranked near the bottom of the league defensively, allowing 27.5 points per game and 4.5 yards per carry. Even with a career-low 3.6 yards per rush this season, McCaffrey has found other ways to dominate. His recent stretch includes multiple 80-yard rushing performances, and his impact as a receiver remains elite. Those 806 receiving yards are already his third-highest total ever, proof that efficiency can take different forms.A brief illness may have raised concern, but it did not change the bigger picture. With McCaffrey ready to go, the 49ers enter Week 15 with momentum, purpose, and one of the league’s most versatile weapons leading the charge.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld’s adorable pregnancy reveal sends Josh Allen and half of Hollywood into full celebration mode","Christian McCaffrey’s return to full practice immediately stabilizes the 49ers’ offensive plans for Week 15.

Shedeur Sanders Cleveland Browns future keeps getting brighter



Shedeur Sanders did not wait long to announce himself in Cleveland. The rookie quarterback has stepped into a difficult season and made it feel competitive again. Every snap carries urgency. Every throw shows confidence. Even in losses, his command has stood out. The Browns are rebuilding, but Sanders has given fans something solid to believe in. He plays with calm, processes fast, and never looks overwhelmed by the moment.That confidence does not disappear when he leaves the field. It follows him home, too. During a recent visit, Sanders gave his father Deion a tour of his new Ohio mansion. The reaction said everything. Deion walked through the house shaking his head, repeating “dang” as he took it all in. It was not just about the size or style. It was about watching his son grow into his own success, step by step, win by win.Shedeur Sanders is the starting quarterback for the Cleveland Browns for the rest of the season, and he looks comfortable carrying that responsibility. A fifth round pick on paper, he plays like someone who expects to be here for a long time.He won his first NFL start and followed it with performances that showed steady growth. Even in back to back losses, he moved the offense with purpose. Last week’s 364 yards and three touchdowns against the Titans proved he can lift a team that is still finding its footing.As Cleveland prepares for brutal weather ahead of a road game in Chicago, Sanders has settled into his new city. The cold does not seem to bother him. His mother Pilar Sanders turned heads at the last home game, bundled up and stylish, while Shedeur stayed focused on his routine. That balance between comfort and discipline matters during a long NFL season.Deion Sanders knows elite lifestyles and elite pressure. His Texas ranch has been a familiar backdrop for Shedeur in the past. Seeing his son establish his own space now hits differently. It signals independence and maturity. Shedeur has always liked the finer things, from flashy jewelry to high end cars, and he has never hidden it. Critics noticed in college, even Tom Brady took a playful jab. None of that slowed him down.Sanders is on a four year, $4.6 million rookie deal. If his growth continues, bigger contracts will follow. For now, the Browns have their quarterback. And Deion has one more reason to smile.Also Read: Tom Brady reacts strongly to Michigan football turmoil as Sherrone Moore’s arrest leaves the Wolverines stunned","Shedeur Sanders is the starting quarterback for the Cleveland Browns for the rest of the season.

Braxton Berrios Alix Earle breakup sparks DWTS absence debate



Braxton Berrios replies to a comment on Instagram (Braxton Berrios/Instagram)

The fallout from a high-profile sports and social media romance has taken an unexpected turn, not because of a dramatic statement, but because of a few carefully chosen words. Houston Texans wide receiver Braxton Berrios has spent weeks watching speculation swirl around his personal life, much of it louder than anything he has said himself. When he finally resurfaced online, it was not with a long explanation or emotional post. Instead, he opted for subtlety, and that choice has fueled even more conversation.Fresh off his split from TikTok star Alix Earle, Berrios returned to Instagram with a calm confidence that felt intentional. His timing raised eyebrows, especially among fans still dissecting the end of a relationship that lasted more than two years. While both sides described the breakup as amicable and career-focused, the public reaction has been anything but quiet.Berrios, 30, appeared unfazed as he posted a carousel of photos with the caption, “What did I miss?” The message landed like a spark in dry grass. Some fans read it as playful. Others saw arrogance. Many assumed it was a response to chatter about his absence during Earle’s run on Dancing With the Stars.That assumption prompted Berrios to step into the comments and address the issue directly. When one fan pointed out that he missed every performance, he replied, ""I would've loved to be. Sadly I wasn't able to travel like that in-season."" He reinforced the point again, adding, ""I would've been at every one if I could've,"" before repeating, ""sadly I can't travel like that in-season.""The explanation did not stop there. When another commenter suggested he skipped a chance to visit Los Angeles during the Texans’ bye week, Berrios clarified, ""That's exactly where I went for bye week."" He also made it clear that his post was not meant to take a swipe at his ex, explaining that it ""was absolutely not supposed to be"" shady.His comments aligned with what Earle had already told her followers. She previously explained that ""he couldn't come bc of football,"" shutting down rumors of tension tied to his schedule. Despite not being in the ballroom, Berrios still showed support. During the Nov. 25 season finale, he appeared in a pre-recorded message, telling her, “I've watched you pour everything into this since the moment it has started, and I think it shows,” followed by, “Good luck. Have fun, babe.”Rumors briefly reignited after a viral exchange involving Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart, but Earle put those to rest, stating the interaction was fake and that there was no contact. Still, the timing of Berrios’ return has kept fans talking.Earle, 24, later offered a glimpse into her emotional state, sharing, “Is my frontal lobe developing,” before adding, “Either I’m maturing or just rlly going thru it…maybe both.” For now, both seem focused on moving forward, even as the spotlight lingers.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld’s adorable pregnancy reveal sends Josh Allen and half of Hollywood into full celebration mode","Houston Texans wide receiver Braxton Berrios recently split from TikTok star Alix Earle.

In a soft winter setting, Hailee stood with her baby bump visible as Josh knelt to kiss it, both of them laughing like they had stepped into their own holiday film. The scene captured a kind of warmth fans rarely get to witness from the intensely private couple.The short video, shared first with readers of Hailee’s Beau Society newsletter, hinted at how intentionally they chose to reveal the news. Hailee closed her list of “29 moments I loved this year… in no particular order” with a simple line: “this video…” Then came the gentle snowfall, the tiny snowman at their feet, and Hailee’s fleece embroidered with the word “mother.” It felt personal. It felt like something they made just for themselves before deciding to let everyone else in.Josh Allen is gearing up for a major showdown against the New England Patriots, yet even a game with playoff implications cannot compete with the milestone he’s celebrating off the field. After marrying in a lavish Southern California ceremony on May 31, the couple has revealed they are expecting their first child, giving fans a rare window into a relationship they usually protect.Support poured in immediately. “OH MY GODDDDD HAILS!!!!!” Millie Bobby Brown wrote, while Gigi Hadid, Sophie Turner, and Ashley Benson joined in with heartfelt messages. Their excitement echoed what many fans had long suspected, especially after Hailee chose outfits in November that cleverly concealed her growing bump.This announcement also follows Hailee’s own reflections on motherhood. In an interview last year, she shared that she “of course” wanted children with Josh, adding, “I literally thank God every day that I found my person, and it's the greatest thing in the world. Life makes sense. Everything makes sense. I feel like I am stepping into the version that I've always dreamed of being, having so much to do with being with him. ”The couple, who have been spotted embracing at Bills games and celebrating family moments throughout the fall, now enters a new chapter that promises even more joy. With their baby arriving in 2026, this holiday season marks the beginning of a story that is only getting sweeter.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld and Josh Allen are expecting their first baby as they begin life beyond the spotlight","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen and actress Hailee Steinfeld are expecting their first baby.

Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson unexpectedly pulled into Sherrone Moore’s Michigan scandal as comparisons fuel controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/bill-belichick-and-jordon-hudson-unexpectedly-pulled-into-sherrone-moores-michigan-scandal-as-comparisons-fuel-controversy/articleshow/125935000.cms,"Michigan coach Sherrone Moore's abrupt firing and arrest over an alleged inappropriate relationship with staffer Paige Shiver have sparked controversy. This situation has drawn comparisons to Bill Belichick's relationship with Jordon Hudson, highlighting the scrutiny on personal lives impacting professional careers in college sports. The ongoing investigation into Moore's conduct continues to unfold.

How Sherrone Moore’s firing created unexpected comparisons to Belichick’s relationship and fueled deeper scrutiny





Sherrone Moore’s sudden downfall at Michigan has already sent shockwaves across the college football world, but the story has now spiraled into an even stranger direction as outsiders are being dragged into the drama, including Bill Belichick and his much-discussed relationship with Jordon Hudson.Moore’s firing, his arrest, and the growing speculation surrounding his alleged relationship with staffer Paige Shiver have created a media storm, prompting analysts and fans to revisit Belichick’s own unconventional romance with Hudson. While the two situations are vastly different, the comparisons reveal the tension simmering beneath college athletics, where image, power dynamics, and off-field decisions can determine a coach’s future just as much as wins and losses.Michigan dismissed Moore just hours before police arrested him in Saline, citing an “inappropriate relationship with a staff member.” Reports suggest Moore’s behavior had grown erratic in the days leading up to his firing, and unconfirmed rumors claim that Paige Shiver, who rose unusually fast to become his Executive Assistant, may have been at the center of his unraveling.Some whispers even suggest she may be pregnant, adding another layer of speculation to Moore’s already chaotic situation.As Moore remained in custody without charges, sports analyst Andrew Brandt sparked debate by contrasting Moore’s conduct with Bill Belichick’s. Belichick’s relationship with Jordon Hudson, who is significantly younger and reportedly met him at 19, has generated headlines, but unlike Moore, Belichick has never been implicated in misconduct. Brandt suggested Moore “could have taken a page out of Belichick’s book,” implying that transparency and boundaries might have prevented the collapse of his career.Moore’s case continues to evolve: Shiver has taken her Instagram private, Michigan is still facing tough questions, and the investigation remains ongoing. For a coach once seen as a rising star with a dream job, the rapid fall is staggering.Meanwhile, Belichick and Hudson, unintentionally dragged into the narrative, serve as a reminder of how quickly public perception shifts when personal relationships intersect with professional responsibilities. In Moore’s case, those intersections may have cost him everything.Also Read: Was Paige Shiver forced into an abortion?

Taylor Swift prepares to marry Travis Kelce as her wedding dress is already being called a once-in-a-generation fashion moment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/taylor-swift-prepares-to-marry-travis-kelce-as-her-wedding-dress-is-already-being-called-a-once-in-a-generation-fashion-moment/articleshow/125942244.cms,"Taylor Swift is reportedly prioritizing a deeply meaningful and historically significant wedding gown for her upcoming marriage to Travis Kelce. Sources indicate British designer Sarah Burton is the leading contender, admired for her ability to blend strength and elegance. This choice signals a focus on craftsmanship and legacy over fleeting trends, potentially influencing bridal fashion for years to come.

Why Sarah Burton has emerged as the leading contender for Taylor Swift’s wedding gown

Taylor Swift may dominate stadiums and charts, but when it comes to her personal milestones, she is taking a far more deliberate and private approach. As anticipation builds around her upcoming wedding to NFL star Travis Kelce, sources suggest Swift is carefully crafting a bridal moment designed to transcend celebrity spectacle and enter cultural history.Insiders say her dress choice is being treated not as a fashion statement alone, but as a symbolic chapter in her evolving public story. With global attention guaranteed, Swift is reportedly prioritizing meaning, craftsmanship, and legacy over trends, signaling that her wedding look may become one of the most influential style moments of the decade.According to sources, Swift has quietly tapped renowned British designer Sarah Burton as the frontrunner to create her wedding dress. The pair allegedly met in London during Swift’s discreet early-December trip, a visit publicly framed around music-related commitments but said to include a private design consultation. Burton, the former creative director of Alexander McQueen and current head of Givenchy, is widely respected for her ability to blend architectural strength with emotional elegance, a balance Swift is believed to admire deeply.A source explained: “Taylor's nuptials will be the wedding of the century and so she is looking for a dress that feels classic but still distinctly her own. Sarah has a way of blending elegance with strength which is why she's the leading contender.”Another insider highlighted the symbolic weight behind the choice, noting: “She loves the symbolism behind it. Burton designed a gown witnessed by a global audience, and Taylor knows her own wedding will carry that same kind of worldwide attention.”Fashion analysts say the potential collaboration could reshape bridal trends worldwide, much like Burton’s iconic 2011 wedding gown for the Princess of Wales. Swift’s long and evolving red-carpet history, spanning vintage glamour, romantic fantasy, and theatrical reinvention, has only intensified speculation over what direction her bridal look may take.Swift herself once said: “I actually never thought about what I would do or what I would want until I met the person.” Friends say that sentiment remains central to her approach, with the gown expected to reflect both her personal growth and her relationship with Kelce.While American designers like Ralph Lauren and Oscar de la Renta remain in consideration, insiders believe Burton’s discretion, couture pedigree, and cultural influence give her a distinct edge. As one industry source put it: “This dress isn’t just fashion, it’s set to be a cultural landmark.”Also Read: Taylor Swift stuns fans with an unexpected confession to Stephen Colbert as Travis Kelce retirement rumors heat up","Taylor Swift is reportedly prioritizing a deeply meaningful and historically significant wedding gown for her upcoming marriage to Travis Kelce.

From casual observer to outspoken Patriots believer

What started as a high-profile romance has evolved into full-blown Patriots loyalty, blending pop culture, sports fandom, and playoff intensity.As New England surges through the 2025–26 season atop the AFC East, Cardi’s unapologetic embrace of football culture is resonating far beyond Foxborough. Her recent viral video didn’t just spark laughs online, it underscored how personal connections can reshape fandom, identity, and even league narratives heading into a pressure-packed postseason run.Cardi B’s viral declaration wasn’t polished or scripted and that’s exactly why it landed.

I ain’t really grow up watching football and none of that sht. You know, I’m a Dominican b*tch.

Sherrone Moore controversy widens as Adam Schefter’s stance draws fire





The college football world watched in disbelief as a series of events involving Sherrone Moore unfolded with stunning speed. Michigan dismissed its head coach after an internal review found what it described as “credible evidence” of an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. The decision alone rattled a program that entered the season with high expectations, but the situation only grew more troubling when Moore was taken into custody hours later. Fans, administrators and former players tried to make sense of a week that upended the program’s sense of stability.The fallout reached beyond Michigan when longtime ESPN insider Adam Schefter became part of the conversation. His framing of the developments sparked immediate criticism and shifted the spotlight toward the role of media voices during moments of public scrutiny. His remarks, delivered during a national broadcast, pushed an already tense story back into the center of debate.Michigan’s decision to terminate Moore “for cause” opened the door to a deeper look at what led to his dismissal. University officials said a summer inquiry uncovered no wrongdoing, but the situation changed when the staff member later presented the administration with text messages and emails. Athletic director Warde Manuel stressed that the conduct violated university policy and that no exception would be made.Hours after the termination, police in Saline detained Moore before transferring him to Pittsfield Township for further investigation. As of Friday morning, he remains in the Washtenaw County Jail awaiting arraignment.While the legal process moved forward, Schefter faced criticism for his televised response. On ESPN, he said, “What we haven’t heard yet is Sherrone Moore’s side of this. And he gets his say in this particular situation as well. I do know he felt like people had it in for him for an awful long time.” His comments struck many viewers as sympathetic at a moment when details were still emerging. The reaction intensified when he repeated on First Take that Moore believed “there were people who were out to get him” and added that “we now have an individual who had his professional life and personal life completely upended. ”Fans argued that Schefter’s tone downplayed the severity of the allegations and blurred the line between reporting and advocacy. The exchange reminded audiences that major stories involving public figures demand careful framing, especially when consequences reach an entire program and community.Also Read: Tom Brady reacts strongly to Michigan football turmoil as Sherrone Moore’s arrest leaves the Wolverines stunned","ESPN's Adam Schefter faced criticism for his televised response to Sherrone Moore's arrest.

Gisele Bündchen reflects on her healing journey , her support for Brady, and opening her heart again

Gisele Bündchen discusses love, life, and co-parenting

Gisele Bündchen is revisiting one of the most difficult chapters of her life, reflecting on her 2022 divorce from NFL legend Tom Brady with a level of honesty she wasn’t ready to share at the time. In a newly resurfaced teaser from her interview with Robin Roberts, the supermodel becomes visibly emotional while discussing the moment her marriage ended and how she has navigated rebuilding her identity since.Though nearly two years have passed, Bündchen’s raw reaction, turning away from the camera and softly asking, “Can I have a little moment?”, shows how deeply the split affected her. Now, she says she's committed to living her truth, embracing new beginnings, and protecting her peace.During the interview, Roberts revisits Bündchen’s earlier description of her divorce as the “death of my dream.” While the former couple finalized their split in October 2022, Bündchen admits the emotional recovery took far longer. She once again pushed back against speculation that Brady’s football career ended the marriage, calling the narratives “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I've ever heard.”Still, her affection for her ex-husband remains clear. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever,” she said, adding, “I want him to achieve and to conquer.I want all his dreams to come true.”The interview also touches on her life post-divorce, including her guarded approach to dating. When asked if she could open her heart again, she smiled and replied, “Where my heart is now is where I am right now. I’m living my truth, and I’m not apologizing for it.”As past reports confirmed, her connection with longtime family jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente eventually turned romantic. Sources say the relationship grew slowly and organically: first as friends, then as a source of comfort, and finally as something deeper after her marriage ended.Bündchen’s vulnerability in the interview highlights not only the grief of losing a long-term partnership but also the quiet resilience required to rebuild a life on one’s own terms. Even years later, her journey remains a reminder that healing is rarely linear and that starting over can hold its own kind of hope.Also Read: “Very hurtful”: Gisele Bündchen sees her divorce from Tom Brady as the end of a dream and the start of a new life","Gisele Bündchen discusses her painful divorce from Tom Brady.

Taylor Swift’s emotional burden and the pressure to keep performing despite fear and grief

Yet moments later, Swift had to walk onstage and deliver what she calls an escape for her fans, despite carrying a heaviness few performers ever face.Swift also reflects on the growing anxiety surrounding fan safety after the CIA uncovered a plot to bomb her Vienna show. The tour had “dodged a massacre situation,” she says, admitting that “being afraid that something is going to happen to your fans is new.”Even amid those fears, she pushed forward, driven by a need to create joy, even when her own emotions felt frayed. After her triumphant Wembley performance, she called Travis Kelce, telling him, ""I was so happy, I thought I was going to forget how to play guitar and sing."" His presence in the documentary underscores the steady support he offered throughout the tour’s most difficult moments.As The End of an Era premieres on Disney+, it reveals that beneath the global phenomenon is a woman carrying enormous emotional weight, yet still choosing connection, compassion, and courage every night she steps onstage.Also Read: Taylor Swift stuns fans with an unexpected confession to Stephen Colbert as Travis Kelce retirement rumors heat up","Taylor Swift's new documentary reveals her profound emotional struggle after meeting Southport stabbing attack survivors.

NBA injury update: Dallas Mavericks guard Dante Exum ruled out for entire season after knee surgery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/nba-injury-update-dallas-mavericks-guard-dante-exum-ruled-out-for-entire-season-after-knee-surgery/articleshow/125942787.cms,"Dante Exum is facing an injury setback (Image via NBA)

Dante Exum’s latest knee setback adds to injury-plagued career and raises questions for the Dallas Mavericks

Dallas Mavericks face tough roster decisions as Dante Exum’s injury limits options

Due to issues with his right knee that may necessitate additional surgery, Dallas Mavericks guard Dante Exum will miss the whole season, the organization said on Thursday. The Mavs revealed on Friday that Exum had a successful season-ending surgery. The Mavs claim that Exum is still dealing with issues from a treatment he had on his right knee during the offseason.This autumn, he hasn't played at all. The problem has been found to require a follow-up procedure. Exum was never cleared to practice after summer knee surgery, despite the Mavs re-signing him to a $3.3 million, one-year contract over the offseason.The Mavericks revealed today that veteran guard Dante Exum will have season-ending surgery, terminating his 2025–2026 campaign before it ever started. Exum's availability has been restricted throughout his professional career due to a number of injuries, the most recent of which is this one.Dallas declared that a follow-up surgery was required due to persistent issues following a right knee repair done during the offseason. The official post read:“The Dallas Mavericks announced that guard Danté Exum underwent successful surgery on his right knee…”Injuries have repeatedly disrupted his career, and this latest setback merely constitutes the next chapter in an aggravating pattern.Also, criticism has emerged over how the Mavericks have handled their roster of late.The former fifth overall pick played all 82 games as a rookie before missing his whole second NBA season in 2015–16 due to a torn ACL. In the years that followed, he struggled with knee, ankle, and shoulder problems.When healthy, the 30-year-old has been a very productive role player for the Mavs. However, since the 2023–2024 season began, he has only made 75 appearances. According to Grant Afseth of the Dallas Hoops Journal, the Mavericks' executive office has been in the headlines lately, thus the team's treatment of Exum in recent months merits some examination.The Mavs may discharge Exum to free up a spot on their 15-man roster, but unless they make another cost-cutting move, they won't have enough space under that hard cap to sign a replacement until January. Dallas could request a disabled player exception if Exum stays on the team, but it would only cover half of the guard's salary, making it insufficient to be very helpful.In order to fit Exum's guaranteed minimum contract under the hard cap, Dallas had to waive Olivier-Maxence Prosper using the stretch rule and conceal Exum's offseason knee surgery. In 75 games over the previous two seasons, Exum played his part for Dallas. To make room on the roster, the Mavs would have to waive Exum.The Mavs currently struggle to replace Exum due to their limited financial flexibility, since a hypothetical handicapped player exception would be insufficient to offer significant assistance. However, according to ESPN's Bobby Marks, Dallas would not be able to sign a player until January 6 since they were hard-capped at the second apron of the salary cap.Also read: NBA injury update: Dereck Lively II faces tough setback as Dallas Mavericks center opts for season-ending surgery",Dallas Mavericks guard Dante Exum will miss the whole season.

Steve Kerr criticizes NBA’s 82-game grind and the league can’t keep dodging the issue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/steve-kerr-criticizes-nbas-82-game-grind-and-the-league-cant-keep-dodging-the-issue/articleshow/125942701.cms,"Steve Kerr and Stephen Curry (Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)

Steve Kerr points to a faster game, less recovery, and a stretched-thin player pool



A shorter season contradicts the revenue generation



In a league where tradition has often outweighed change, Golden State Warriors’ head coach Steve Kerr has ignited a conversation that many coaches tread carefully: NBA season being too long for modern times.Kerr emailed the NBA’s commissioner, Adam Silver, at the beginning of the 2024-25 season, expressing concerns and requesting a reduction in the number of games, as the 82-game season is too demanding and drastically affects the quality of play. The same year, NBA sealed its media rights deal at $76 billion over 11 years, and despite that, the questions regarding player welfare and health remain unanswered.With more and more stars missing practice for weeks due to injury, the hefty contracts and big bucks might become an eyesore in the near future.During last month’s press conference ahead of Warriors vs Magic at the Kia Centre, Steve Kerr was asked about the league’s pace and the growing number of key players being off the bench due to injuries. To which he replied, “I’m very concerned.”He added, “It’s dramatic. The pace difference is dramatic. This team tonight has really upped their pace compared to last year. I think across the league everybody understands now it’s just easier to score now if you can beat (the other team) down the floor, get out in transition.But when everybody’s doing that, the games are much faster paced, and everyone has to cover out to 25 feet because everyone can shoot 3s.”Steve Kerr’s statement is not just empty words, rather, it is a lived experience. As a coach, he has seen multiple players missing games or not reaching their full potential due to burnout and injuries. In fact, the Golden State Warriors’ matchup against the Houston Rockets on Nov. 26 brought more than just a sour loss: Stephen Curry suffered a left quad contusion after a hard contact while defending Rockets’ Amen Thompson during the fourth quarter.Curry has missed the last 5 five games due to this, and his return for Friday’s match-up against the Timberwolves at the Chase Center is also not confirmed. The Warriors will have to make do without their central offensive element if Curry is not cleared for the game.The 82-game season is physically taxing for each player, and by mid-season, they often have to deal with fatigue, which reduces efficiency and collectively degrades the quality of play on the court. In contrast, a shorter and smartly arranged season will provide plenty of time for the players to rest and recover while pushing them for better performances, increasing the output on the court.The league’s revenue system works on: the more the merrier. But if the crucial contributors are not in the mix, then it can never work at its optimum level. With the NBA expanding and becoming bigger, player longevity remains a central point in the league’s success. They can ignore these questions now, but can’t they afford to do the same for a longer time?Also read: NBA injury update: Stephen Curry’s return nears as Golden State Warriors prepare for crucial match agains","Steve Kerr emailed the NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, at the beginning of the 2024-25 season, expressing concerns and requesting a reduction in the number of games.

New York Knicks hold early trade talks as Donte DiVincenzo reunion quietly gains traction

Donte DiVincenzo could be a good fit for the New York Knicks

This season, the New York Knicks are anticipated to be active in the trade market, and it's possible that they will bring back a fan favorite guard during a championship. As the trade deadline draws near, the Knicks are reportedly looking into ways to improve their backcourt.They have expressed interest in guard Donte DiVincenzo of the Minnesota Timberwolves and guard Jose Alvarado of the New Orleans Pelicans, according to ClutchPoints. Before the trade deadline, the New York Knicks are positioned to be one of the NBA's most aggressive clubs despite having few resources and freedom. This is probably the reason why they are reportedly eyeing Donte DiVincenzo.Kris Pursiainen of ClutchPoints claims that New York wants to strengthen their guard depth this year. Donte DiVincenzo, a former Knick and guard for the Minnesota Timberwolves, is one of the guys they are considering. Pursiainen wrote:“League sources tell ClutchPoints that the Knicks have had exploratory discussions with two Western Conference teams about potential trades, with New Orleans Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado and Minnesota Timberwolves guard Donte DiVincenzo at the center of various proposals.”He further explained:“One source familiar with the situation told ClutchPoints that Minnesota sent New York's front office several trade proposals, but that the sides did not come close to any agreement,” “The Timberwolves are said to have some interest in the protected first-round pick the Knicks are owed by the Washington Wizards, according to league sources.”According to Pursiainen, the Timberwolves and the Knicks have had ""exploratory discussions"" over DiVincenzo's availability as a result of the Knicks' reported hunt for another guard.Before being moved to the Timberwolves as part of the historic Karl-Anthony Towns trade, DiVincenzo played one season with the Knicks in 2023–2024.He averaged a career-high 15.5 points and shot a career-high 40.1% from three during that one season with New York, which was the greatest of his career. Additionally, DiVincenzo also broke Evan Fournier's previous record of 241 three-pointers made in a single season in the 2021–2022 season with 283. During his one season with the Knicks in 2023–2024, DiVincenzo averaged 15.5 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 2.7 assists per game, which was the finest statistical year of his career.After their amazing run to the Eastern Conference Finals the previous season, the Knicks had high expectations going into the season. For the team, which is trying to win its first championship in more than 50 years, anything else this season is a failure.For a Knicks rotation, reuniting with DiVincenzo would be crucial. Additionally, New York would be less dependent on the inconsistent Jordan Clarkson as a result of this transfer. The Knicks have a chance to bring DiVincenzo back and address a significant need off the bench.New York's bench output has improved this year compared to last, but they could need an additional aggressive scorer who is a great shooter. Going all out for depth players who can help get a title is a tactic the Knicks should follow, as they are currently attempting to win a championship.Also read: Is Malik Beasley joining New York Knicks?

Stephen Curry's Injury Report vs the Minnesota Timberwolves (December 12, 2025)

Warriors’ Depth Tested During Absences

Minnesota Timberwolves Injury Report vs the Golden State Warriors (December 12, 2025)

Stephen Curry’s long-awaited return arrives at a crucial moment for the Golden State Warriors, who have battled inconsistency, injuries, and depth challenges throughout the early stretch of the 2025–26 season. After missing five straight games with a left quad contusion and muscle strain, the 37-year-old superstar is officially expected to suit up against the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 12, providing a spark the team has desperately needed. His comeback follows a full practice session on December 11, where he completed scrimmages and was later removed from the injury report, signaling full medical clearance.For a Warriors team sitting just above .500, Curry’s presence injects both stability and urgency. The matchup also arrives at a time when the Western Conference standings remain tightly packed, with Golden State looking to climb out of the early-season traffic. With minutes management still possible, the stage is set for Curry to reestablish his rhythm while elevating the Warriors’ offense back to elite levels.Stephen Curry’s setback began on November 26 against the Houston Rockets, where fourth-quarter collisions left him visibly limping. An MRI confirmed a quad contusion coupled with muscle strain, initially suggesting a multi-week recovery window. However, his progress accelerated faster than projected. Before this latest stretch, Curry had already missed nine total games on the season, with Golden State going 4-5 in his absence. Still, the Warriors steadied themselves enough to stand at 13-12 overall, including a 3-2 record during this specific Curry-less span. His season averages, 27.9 points on 47.1 percent shooting and 91.9 percent from the line,underscore exactly what Golden State has been missing.Golden State’s supporting cast stepped up in the interim, with Buddy Hield contributing 11 points per game recently, while Jimmy Butler III and Trayce Jackson-Davis supplied timely scoring and defensive presence. Yet the roster remains shorthanded. Draymond Green is out due to personal reasons, veteran Al Horford is sidelined with right sciatic nerve irritation, and Jackson-David faces a game-time decision because of a knee concern. Curry’s reinsertion will help stabilize rotations shaken by multiple absences.Minnesota arrives as one of the West’s strongest performers but faces injury uncertainty of its own.

Chicago Bulls’ Injury Report vs the Charlotte Hornets (December 12, 2025)

How LaMelo Ball’s Absence Shapes the Matchup

LaMelo Ball’s status has been the focal point for Charlotte fans all week, and tonight brings no relief. As the Hornets prepare to host the Chicago Bulls on December 12, 2025, they once again face the reality of navigating a tough stretch without their franchise star. The backcourt has already battled inconsistency and injuries throughout the season, and Ball’s absence only deepens the challenge in a matchup where every possession will matter.This latest setback arrives during a moment when Charlotte Hornets have begun building momentum with a 3–2 surge. Yet the optimism is tempered by concern, as LaMelo Ball’s injury history continues to shadow the Hornets’ aspirations. Without his signature pace, deep-range confidence, and initiator presence, the team must yet again adjust on the fly.LaMelo Ball will not play tonight against the Bulls, marking his second straight missed contest due to a left ankle bone bruise. He originally aggravated the ankle on December 5 against the Raptors after slipping on defense. Ball logged just 12 minutes in that game, scoring 11 points before exiting.What initially appeared to be routine soreness escalated into a bone bruise, sidelining him for the December 7 matchup with Denver and now this meeting with Chicago. This adds up to his eighth absence of the season, continuing a pattern of ankle issues that have slowed him despite producing career-best assist numbers at 8.9 per game.Charlotte Hornets enter the game severely shorthanded across multiple positions, especially in the backcourt.Chicago is also missing key contributors. Ayo Dosunmu remains out with a right thumb sprain, while other absences linger. Zach Collins is trending upward and listed as probable with a left scaphoid fracture. Coby White (right calf tightness) and Tre Jones (left ankle sprain) are also probable, potentially stabilizing the rotation.LaMelo Ball’s 19.9 points per game and playmaking vacuum leave Charlotte Hornets searching for rhythm against a Bulls squad desperate to halt their skid. Josh Green, newly cleared, is expected to shoulder an expanded role. Betting lines list Charlotte at +1.5 with a 234.5 over/under, projecting a grind-heavy contest without star firepower. Ball’s return timeline remains unclear as the Hornets tread carefully through another taxing point in the season.","Charlotte Hornets host the Chicago Bulls on December 12, 2025.

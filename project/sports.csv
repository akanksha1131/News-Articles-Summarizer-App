'A narrative is run outside, but... ': Shubman Gill opens up on alleged tension with Rohit Sharma

Poll How important do you think fitness is for a cricketer's performance? Very Important Somewhat Important Not Important Unsure

Former India coach Abhishek Nayar has opened up on Rohit Sharma ’s remarkable fitness transformation, revealing the thought process behind the India skipper’s 11-kilo weight loss and his vision for the 2027 World Cup.“I think there’s been a lot of talk about the weight loss,” Nayar told JioHotstar at the start of the match.“The initial parts were about obviously getting fitter, getting leaner. I spoke about this before. There was this spitting image of him walking out of the airport, you know, after his holiday in the UK. So that was something he wanted to change. He wanted to come back.”According to Nayar, the transformation wasn’t just about aesthetics — it was a long-term plan with 2027 ODI World Cup in mind.“The outlook was obviously the 2027 World Cup — to be fitter, to be stronger, to be lighter, agile. And the skill has always been there. So the fitness has only amplified the skill. It’s helped him, you know, move faster. His agility is the best it’s ever been.”Nayar even joked about the weight difference bringing visible changes to Rohit’s game. “We are hoping that those 11 kilos that he’s lost — and I say this 11,000 grams lighter than Rohit Sharma is — you can see those faster pullers and better square cuts this time around.”For Rohit, the transformation is not just physical but mental too. “He’s excited. He’s keen. He knows there’s a bit of pressure and talk around, you know, will he reach the 2027 World Cup? The first statement was his weight. Hopefully, the second statement is the runs he gets with the bat.”Rohit's previous T20I and ODI outings ended with celebration after guiding the team to ICC trophies, and he was leading the side even in his last Test appearance in Melbourne.The celebrated cricketer will clearly be knowing that they no longer have the immunity of leadership role or luxury of time, as the current selectors and team management have no deep remorse in taking some harsh calls with future in mind, particularly the 2027 ODI World Cup.",Former India coach Abhishek Nayar has opened up on Rohit Sharma ’s remarkable fitness transformation.

'Unfair at this stage!': Virat Kohli's childhood coach on the treatment of senior duo Virat-Rohit

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s love affair with Australia is no secret, and his return to the Indian jersey adds extra intrigue to the first ODI of the three-match series starting Sunday at Optus Stadium, Perth. The series also marks the comeback of Rohit Sharma , as both Indian stalwarts will be seen in action for the first time since lifting the ICC Champions Trophy earlier this year.After completing a practice session on Saturday, Kohli took time to interact with fans, signing autographs and clicking pictures with a group of eager supporters. During the session, a few Australian fans were reportedly commenting and laughing at him. Without uttering a word, Kohli’s piercing stare silenced them, displaying the intensity that has defined his career.Kohli’s childhood coach, Rajkumar Sharma, said the star batter has nothing left to prove in international cricket, noting his exceptional record and contribution to Indian cricket. ""Virat doesn't have to prove anything, he has achieved everything, the way he has played, the way he has won the matches for the country, everyone knows his contribution. He is well prepared, and whenever he is well prepared, the results are always good, and I have full faith that he will do well as usual,"" Sharma said.This marks Kohli’s first outing in the Indian jersey since March 9, when India lifted the Champions Trophy.Watch the video here He had been expected to return to the Test format for India’s tour of England for the inaugural Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, but instead chose to retire from Tests, ending a remarkable 14-year-long journey.Debates continue over how Kohli will handle Australia’s fast-paced pitches and whether this three-match ODI series might be his last appearance Down Under. While he has confirmed his intention to feature in the 2027 World Cup, speculation persists about what the near future holds.Sharma also praised both Kohli and Rohit Sharma, saying their contributions to Indian cricket are already well-established.""I would like to say that both of them are great players, and they have nothing left to prove, because the whole of India knows their contribution to Indian cricket, so if they have to prove themselves at this stage, then it will be a very funny thing,"" he added.","Virat Kohli's return to the Indian team adds extra intrigue to three-match series.

Poll Who do you think will have the greater impact in the series? Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma Shubman Gill Mitchell Marsh

New challenge for Shreyas

An astounding 1,75,000 tickets already sold for a white-ball bilateral series, according to Cricket Australia’s Friday press release. At a time when ODI cricket is fighting for relevance — more so the context-less, bilateral 50over variety — the interest around the series starting at the Optus Stadium in Perth on Sunday is quite a pleasant surprise for lovers of the format.But then, is the hype around the series all about the game or about two individuals instead? If you happen to listen to India’s new ODI captain Shubman Gill ’s match-eve press conference on a sunny Perth afternoon, you’ll know.Every second question was about Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , about their presence and utility in a team which is taking its first steps towards preparing for the 2027 ODI World Cup in South Africa. “They are players with immense experience and quality. Doesn’t matter what the outside narrative is, I look up to them and take their help whenever necessary,” Gill said, not putting a foot wrong in his first interaction as the new ODI captain.The visuals from practice also suggest that the two white-ball legends are in good mood and form, ready to savour the remains of the day. But come Sunday, the challenge for the duo will be immense, given the time they have spent away from cricket and the quality of the Australian pace attack.The Perth pitch, even at its best, will have enough pace and bounce to catch one off guard. More so if there is a Mitchell Starc and a Josh Hazlewood in the opposition lineup. If Starc can get the ball to swing a bit, he will almost invariably trouble Rohit. What will be interesting to see is whether the pressure of ‘perform or perish’, a situation that Rohit hasn’t faced during his captaincy days, curbs his natural instinct to go hammer and tongs right from the word go.Virat, meanwhile, will remember his struggles outside the off-stump late last year in Australia against the red-ball, a phase that ultimately cost him his Test career. The Aussie pacers will look to hit the same channel and may just have a slip in place early on to remind the 51-ton man that they can boss him with the white ball as well. But then, ODIs are Kohli’s playing field and the outcome of these duels may just give us an early indication how long we will see the modern master play.While all the talk has been around ‘RoKo’, there are a few other issues that need to be settled. With Hardik Pandya not there, India’s hands may be forced to play three specialist pacers, even if Nitish Reddy gets the nod as the allrounder who bowls a little bit of medium pace. Given India’s inclination to go with eight batters across formats, there could be a case where both Axar Patel and Washington Sundar play and Kuldeep Yadav misses out despite him excelling across formats lately.The Australian ODI batting lineup doesn’t look the strongest, especially after the retirement of Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell and Josh Inglis and Cameron Green’s injuries. That should allow the Indian pace attack, which will be without Jasprit Bumrah, a little bit of breathing space.Mohammed Siraj and Arshdeep Singh look likely to be in the XI and it would be interesting to see if Harshit Rana gets the nod ahead of Prasidh Krishna. For them, getting captain Mitchell Marsh, who has been in good form of late, early would be the key to put the brakes on the Aussies.Another Indian player whose performance will be followed with some interest is Shreyas Iyer. He has been made the vice-captain, which suggests that the team management wants to give him a long rope. The Mumbai batter has had his struggles against the short ball, but he will try to show the world that such ghosts have been well and truly buried.","1,75,000 tickets already sold for a white-ball bilateral series.

Poll Was Shams Mulani's performance the turning point of the match? Absolutely Somewhat Not really Not at all

Deshpande battled bronchitis flare-up

Shams Mulani has been Mumbai’s go-to man whenever they’ve been in search of wickets over the last few years, and more often than not, he has delivered.On Saturday, the 42-time champions found themselves in a similar situation against Jammu & Kashmir. With not many runs to defend and their pacers proving ineffective, Mumbai were desperate to break the growing partnership between J&K skipper Paras Dogra (29, 54b; 5x4) and Qamran Iqbal (56, 107b; 5x4). The duo had already stitched together a 53run stand for the third wicket, taking J&K closer to the target of 243.Mumbai skipper Shardul Thakur turned to Mulani to work his magic, more in hope than expectation. But the left-arm spinner didn’t disappoint. The 28-year-old ran through the J&K line-up, finishing with figures of 7/46, five of them bowled, to set up Mumbai’s 35-run victory at the Sher-i-Kashmir Stadium.It was a herculean effort by Mulani, especially as spinners had largely played a supporting role until he turned the Elite Group D encounter on its head.It began with the wicket of Dogra in the 27th over—Mulani’s second of the spell—when he dismissed the 41-year-old with a ball that dipped, gripped, and spun past his forward press to disturb the stumps.It was a crucial wicket in the context of the match, as J&K’s batting revolved around Dogra, who had scored a fine century in the first innings.Mulani admitted after the match that Dogra’s dismissal was pivotal. “It lifted my mood and the team’s as well,” he said.Mulani, who had also scored 91 in Mumbai’s first innings, was adjudged Man of the Match.Earlier, Thakur gave Mumbai their first breakthrough in the fourth over of the day when he trapped Musaif Ajaz leg-before. Mumbai’s confidence soared when Tanush Kotian took a sharp return catch to dismiss Abdul Samad, the talented righthander once again choosing an ultra-aggressive approach instead of grinding it out, and paying the price.From there, it was the Mulani show. His trademark mix of dip, grip, and turn bamboozled the J&K batters. “I was bowling from a good angle and tried to hit the same spot on the pitch where the ball was straightening as well. So I stuck to that strategy throughout,” Mulani explained.Mumbai pacer Tushar Deshpande overcame a severe bronchitis attack to play for Mumbai against Jammu & Kashmir in Srinagar. The 30-yearold experienced breathlessness while warming up before the first day’s play resumed. He was immediately rushed to a local hospital, where he underwent emergency treatment for a bronchitis flare-up. The Mumbai team management wasn’t sure of his participation, but Deshpande insisted on playing the match and took three wickets in the first innings.",Shams Mulani took 7/46 as Mumbai beat Jammu & Kashmir by 35 runs.

Women's World Cup prediction: Greenstone Lobo explains which team has best chance to win

Poll Will India secure a victory against England in the World Cup match? Yes, they will win No, they will lose

Unexpected rain made an unwelcome appearance at Indore on Saturday, forcing the groundstaff at the Holkar Stadium to cover the ground completely. It disrupted the preparations of India and England as both were forced to cancel their pre-match practice sessions. Fortunately, the weather forecast for Sunday, when Indian women resume their campaign after a week’s break in a crucial World Cup match, is for a sunny day.As the hosts aim to secure a semifinal berth, a victory over England would serve as the perfect ‘Diwali gift’ for the nation. This cricket-mad central Indian city is adorned with decorative lights and diyas as it soaks in the festive spirit. It is now up to captain Harmanpreet Kaur and her team to enhance that feelgood factor by elevating their performance for the expected packed house of 30,000 fans. It will be the first time that Indian women will play an ODI at the Holkar Stadium.While they started their journey with victories against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, India’s campaign soon faltered as they suffered consecutive defeats to South Africa and Australia. Having already flunked half the litmus test that SENA countries were anticipated to put India through in this World Cup, the hosts now seek to overcome England, who have remained unbeaten.They narrowly escaped defeat in their last match against Pakistan, where they collapsed to 79 for seven before rain intervened. India triumphed over England in England winning the ODI series 2-1 earlier in the year. However, the pressure of a must-win World Cup match presents a different challenge.In a significant boost for England, their head coach Charlotte Edwards confirmed during the pre-match press conference that star left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone and pacer Lauren Bell, who missed the match against Pakistan due to illness, have recovered in time for this crucial encounter. England will also rely heavily on their captain and star all-rounder Nat Sciver-Brunt, who scored 117 to influence their 89-run win over Sri Lanka.India are currently fourth on the table, while England are third. England need just one more win to guarantee a semifinal berth. India need to win two out of their three remaining matches to guarantee a top-four berth.The hosts will need to consider adding a sixth bowler and reinstating ace pacer Renuka Singh Thakur to strengthen their attack. India’s World Cup campaign faced setbacks following successive three-wicket losses in Visakhapatnam, where the team failed to defend totals of 251 and 330 on a flat pitch, casting doubts about their strategy of utilising only five regular bowlers and packing the team with allrounders.","India take on England in a must-win game in Indore on Sunday.

Bangladesh's Rishad Hossain delivered an exceptional performance with career-best figures of 6/35, leading his team to a 74-run victory over West Indies in the opening match of their three-match ODI series on Saturday.His bowling figures stand as the second-best by a Bangladesh bowler in ODIs, following Mashrafe Bin Mortaza's 6-26 against Kenya in 2006. Rishad also contributed with the bat, scoring a quick 26 runs off 13 balls.Brandon King and Alick Athanzae provided West Indies a solid start on the slow Mirpur pitch during their chase.The game shifted when Rishad was introduced in the 12th over. He dismissed Athanaze for 27, followed by Keacy Carty's wicket, and then removed King, who top-scored with 44, leaving West Indies at 82-3 in the 22nd over.Bowling eight consecutive overs in his first spell, Rishad dismantled the West Indies middle order.

Substitute Ronald Araújo snatched Barcelona a 2-1 victory over Girona in stoppage time in La Liga on Saturday and ended a mini losing streak before the clasico at Real Madrid next week.The central defender made the move of a striker when he slid in front of his marker as they raced to the near post and skilfully redirected a low pass from Frenkie de Jong and ignited the home crowd.Araújo's last-gasp goal came moments after Barcelona coach Hansi Flick was sent off with two quick yellow cards apparently for complaining that the referee had not added more than four minutes of injury time.The sending off means Flick won't be on the sideline for the first clasico of the season.Before the international break, Barcelona lost to Paris Saint-Germain 2-1 in the Champions League and was stunned at Sevilla 4-1 in La Liga.Pedri González gave Barcelona the lead with an exquisite goal in the 13th, sliding an angled ball back across the area and inside the near post without looking at the target.But Barcelona's control collapsed after Axel Witsel equalized seven minutes later with an acrobatic bicycle kick to whip a loose high ball off the turf and past Wojciech Szczesny.Only Szczesny's saves and some poor marksmanship by Girona kept the visitors from taking the lead before halftime after it was able to mount repeated counterattacks after Barcelona lost possession.Girona then needed goalie Paulo Gazzaniga to turn back shots by Fermín López and Marcus Rashord before Araújo´s clinched the result.With Barcelona missing strikers Robert Lewandowski and Ferran Torres and playmaker Dani Olmo to injury, Flick gave a La Liga debut to 17-year-old forward Toni Fernández.

India's men's senior national football team has dropped to 136th place in the latest FIFA World Rankings, marking their lowest position since November 2016.The team's new ranking coincides with their elimination from both the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifications.India's football journey has seen significant changes in recent times. After achieving success in the 2023 Intercontinental Cup, SAFF Championship, and Tri-Nation Series, the team's performance has declined considerably.Their promising period, which had helped them reach the top 100 rankings, was followed by a disappointing AFC Asian Cup campaign in Qatar. The team failed to score any goals and suffered three consecutive defeats in the group stage.The national team's leadership has undergone multiple changes, with three different head coaches in less than two years. Igor Štimac was replaced by Manolo Márquez, who was later succeeded by Khalid Jamil.Under Jamil's leadership, the team showed some tactical improvements during the CAFA Nations Cup friendly tournament. However, their competitive match results have remained unsatisfactory.The team's most recent competitive victory was against Kuwait in November 2023, with a score of 1-0.In the global rankings, Spain maintains its position at the top, followed by Argentina and France in second and third places respectively.

British officials are under mounting pressure to reverse a decision that prevents Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters from attending a European match at Aston Villa. The Israeli government has criticised this ban.Aston Villa announced that following police guidance, away fans would not be permitted at the UEFA Europa League match against the Israeli club in Birmingham on November 6 due to security concerns.""Shameful decision!

Juergen Klinsmann enjoys a rare distinction of being part of Der Klassiker both as a player and a coach. He is one of the four managers to have played for Bayern Munich and coached the Bavarian elites. Croatian Niko Kovac, the current Borussia Dortmund coach plotting to disrupt Bayern Munich’s all-win record this season on Saturday, is also part of the unique club.Talking to TOI on Wednesday, an excited Klinsmann expressed his thoughts on the upcoming fixture, considered to be the biggest draw in the Bundesliga. With Dortmund’s Serhou Guirassy cleared to play, the German goal-scoring legend feels that his eyes will sway between the Guinean striker and Bayern’s in-form Harry Kane “Well, I think these are the games that, as a striker, you wait for the whole year. You badly want to score in these matchups. So, obviously it doesn’t need extra motivation for any of the players when these two teams clash because it’s a big deal in Germany and for all the Bundesliga fans around the world.”Klinsmann obviously loves talking about strikers. “Kane, Guirassy, (Michael) Olise, (Karim) Adeyemi, all, I’m sure, wait for such evenings.Days before, you kind of think through it and you wish you want to score. Immediately television and social media will showcase the moment around the world and that’s pretty cool.”Scoring seems to come as naturally as breathing for Harry Kane, the English captain in Bayern’s forward lineup. He has already scored 21 goals for club and country. Guirassy, too, has 10 to his credit across all competitions.“I think games like that, you want to have somebody to stand out. You want to have somebody to put the stamp on the match. And when you have players of this calibre, then all us football fans want to wait for these moments. We want to see them kind of prove a point,” said the German goal-scoring legend.Klinsmann couldn’t help referring to his playing days but not in a glorifying nostalgic way. Accepting the evolution of the game, he said, “The video analysts and the coaching staff dissect your game so thoroughly that they know where the weaknesses of the opponents are, how to break them down. During my days, things weren’t that sophisticated. We were not so deeply prepared by video analysts about the opponents.”(Watch Bundesliga 2025-26 Bayern Munich vs. Borussia Dortmund on 18th October 2025 from 10 PM IST live on Sony Sports Ten 2 SD & HD.)","Juergen Klinsmann is one of the four managers to have played for Bayern Munich and coached the Bavarian elites.

Poll Should XL bully dogs be banned in all countries? Yes, for public safety. No, responsible ownership is key. Maybe, with stricter regulations.

Algeria international and Saudi Pro League winger Said Benrahma has been fined £12,000 (Rs 14 lakh) for owning dangerously out-of-control dogs that attacked a golden retriever in 2023 while he was playing for West Ham.Benrahma admitted to two counts of owning dangerously out-of-control dogs during a court hearing via video link from Saudi Arabia, where he currently plays for Neom.The incident took place in east London when his two XL bullies escaped from his home and attacked a golden retriever named Bailey, injuring the dog and a man.The retriever required veterinary treatment, while its owner sustained grazes to the arms and legs.Benrahma defended himself by saying the dogs escaped through a side gate left open by someone working for him at the time. The dogs now live in France.District Judge Matt Jabbitt imposed fines of £5,000 for each attack and ordered Benrahma to pay £2,500 compensation to Bailey’s owner, plus £495 in kennel costs.The judge noted that Benrahma “expressed remorse when interviewed” and also remarked that it was his first time “sentencing someone in the Middle East.”The case took place months before the British government introduced a ban on owning XL bully dogs in England and Wales following a series of fatal attacks.Under the current law, it is a criminal offense to own such dogs without a certificate of exemption.Despite Benrahma's defense, the magistrate emphasized the severity of the attacks, which left both an animal and a person injured.The winger’s case has drawn attention not only because of his footballing profile but also due to the growing public scrutiny around XL bully dogs and the potential dangers posed when such animals are left unsupervised.","Said Benrahma has been fined £12,000 (around USD 16,000) for owning dangerously out-of-control dogs that attacked a golden retriever in 2023 while he was playing for West Ham.

League officials reviewed the footage and determined his actions did not warrant a penalty. This decision comes as Brian Branch, who Mahomes interacted with, faces suspension for a separate incident.

Patrick Mahomes avoids fine after heated moment with Brian Branch

Patrick Mahomes’ fiery competitiveness isn’t new to the league office

The NFL has finally reached a decision regarding Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes ’ controversial touchdown celebration during Monday night’s 30-17 win over the Detroit Lions and the league is opting not to issue any punishment. The ruling comes amid heightened scrutiny on taunting and unsportsmanlike conduct this season, following a memo warning players that even “minor baiting gestures” could lead to hefty fines.In the closing seconds of the first half, Mahomes capped off a hard-fought eight-play drive with a one-yard touchdown that gave Kansas City a 13-10 lead. What happened next set off a wave of online debate: Mahomes dropped the ball, pointed at Lions safety Brian Branch, and flexed while wiping off his jersey, a move that many fans and analysts called clear taunting.According to the NFL rule book, any act that “uses baiting or taunting acts or words that may engender ill will between teams” can draw a fine, typically starting at $11,593 for a first offense. However, league officials reportedly reviewed the footage and concluded that Mahomes’ actions did not rise to the level of a punishable infraction.The decision sparked mixed reactions, especially since Branch was suspended one game for throwing a postgame punch at JuJu Smith-Schuster, the very player he’d clashed with earlier during Mahomes’ celebration moment.This isn’t the first time Mahomes has found himself at the center of NFL discipline talks. The two-time MVP was previously fined $50,000 in 2023 for verbally abusing officials and hit with another $14,000 fine last season for a gesture deemed unsportsmanlike against the Buffalo Bills.Still, Mahomes’ intensity has long been part of his identity, something fans say fuels his success just as much as his arm talent. And with the Chiefs continuing their push for another Super Bowl run, it seems the league is letting this one slide as passion rather than provocation.For now, Mahomes walks away fine-free but with the NFL’s crackdown on taunting in full effect, his celebrations will likely be under the microscope the rest of the season.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes teases Patrick Mahomes with hilarious challenge ahead of Chiefs vs. Raiders showdown","Patrick Mahomes will not be fined for his touchdown celebration against the Lions, despite the NFL's increased scrutiny on taunting.

Packers face major travel hiccup before key NFC North clash against Cardinals



Cardinals eye rebound as Packers try to stay composed



The Green Bay Packers’ hopes of keeping their NFC North lead have hit an unexpected snag before even taking the field. The team’s flight to Arizona was delayed for more than five hours on Saturday due to a mechanical issue, leaving players and staff stranded on the tarmac and raising questions about how this might affect their performance against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday.According to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, “The Packers have yet to depart for Arizona because of mechanical issues with the team plane. The delay is now approaching five hours, and they’re still on the tarmac.” With kickoff set for 1:25 p.m. Mountain Time, the extended delay has disrupted the team’s travel schedule and possibly their routine preparation before a pivotal Week 7 matchup.The Packers enter the game with a 3-1-1 record, holding a narrow edge over the Detroit Lions in the NFC North race. They’re coming off a strong 27–18 win against the Cincinnati Bengals following a bye week. But this travel disruption is an unwelcome twist for a team that thrives on rhythm and preparation.For comparison, such delays aren’t unprecedented in the NFL. Earlier this year, the Jacksonville Jaguars endured a lengthy postgame storm delay after facing the Colts. Still, being grounded for hours just before a key road game can throw off focus and recovery schedules — especially when the flight from Green Bay to Phoenix takes roughly three and a half hours.While Green Bay wrestles with travel issues, the Arizona Cardinals are desperate for a turnaround. After a 2–0 start, they’ve dropped four straight and sit at the bottom of the NFC West. Backup quarterback Jacoby Brissett will start again, with Kyler Murray sidelined by a foot injury.Despite the chaos, oddsmakers still favor Green Bay by 6.5 points, given their stronger record and overall form. However, fatigue from the delayed flight could become a silent factor once they hit the field.For now, the Packers’ first challenge this weekend isn’t on the gridiron — it’s getting to Arizona in time to play.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes teases Patrick Mahomes with hilarious challenge ahead of Chiefs vs. Raiders showdown","The Green Bay Packers' flight to Arizona was delayed for more than five hours on Saturday due to a mechanical issue.

Things look uncertain as Detroit Pistons weigh a crucial decision on Jalen Duren’s future

Jalen Duren delivers a dominant performance as the Detroit Pistons enjoys a preseason win

The franchise player for the Detroit Pistons agreed to co-sign with Jalen Duren. Although Jalen has been improving on his own, it makes sense that there would be some reluctance from the front office's point of view. Jalen is a good player and the Detroit Pistons had defeated the Washington Wizards with his help.According to reports, the Pistons are hesitant to give a big man a figure that is too high in regards to Duren. There is also some anxiety because this player has historically experienced injury problems throughout the years.There are many who doubt that the extensions will be worked out before the deadline on Monday. However, the Detroit Pistons are not anticipated to extend contracts with Jalen Duren, according to The Stein Line. They stated:“Sources say neither first-round pick for the Pistons has generated much momentum on a new deal with Detroit to this point in the process. The sudden announcement this week that Ivey needed a surgical procedure to alleviate discomfort in his right knee isn't expected to require a significant recovery period.”It continued:“But it certainly doesn't make negotiations any easier for the Pistons, who might understandably elect to be cautious. Ivey's camp nonetheless anticipates a promising market next summer even in the wake of last season's left tibia fracture.”For the first time in 20 years, they are on track to become a winning team consistently. According to reports, the Pistons must restore their core and maintain consistency. The length of time that conversations have lasted without a settlement makes sense. The experienced center's rookie-scale deal will expire in the final year.Although no terms have been agreed upon as of yet, the Pistons still have time to offer the veteran center an extension. Free agency is likely in Duren 's future should he and the Detroit Pistons fail to come to an understanding prior to the 2025-2026 season.Thursday saw the Detroit Pistons tie their 2-2 preseason mark as they defeated the Washington Wizards comfortably at Little Caesars Arena. Jalen Duren topped the team with 20 points, 6 boards, and 3 blocks. Duren finished the third quarter with 18 points, demonstrating his continued dominance.He also appeared to be in mid-season form on Thursday, causing all of his damage in just 19 minutes. After playing for just 26.1 minutes per game in nine-category leagues during the regular season, he finished as a seventh-round fantasy value.In 19 minutes of Thursday's preseason victory over the Wizards, Duren scored 20 points, pulled down six rebounds, dished out one assist, stole two steals, and blocked three.Also read: Is Malik Beasley joining New York Knicks?

She gave him the full freedom to choose or do whatever he wants with his life. “What I want for LeBron is his happiness. He loves basketball”, she said. “But I would like to see him graduate with his class from high school, at least. But we'll make a decision when the time comes”, she added further.

Stephen A. Smith questions LeBron James’ selective racial confrontations

Stephen A. Smith said that LeBron James jeopardized his image after Bronny James’ incident

There is an ongoing beef between ESPN’s host and the Los Angeles Lakers legend. That’s right, Stephen A. Smith is not yet over with the dispute between him and NBA legend LeBron James . In a recent interview, Smith said that James had once confronted him, and that did not go well. He also said that James’ attitude towards critics might have something to do with race. Well, both previously had some arguments regarding Bronny James, LeBron James’ son. The Lakers star also criticized Smith for attacking his son during the third quarter of the match. Here’s what the ESPN host has to say about James’ selective racial confrontations:Stephen A. Smith appeared in an interview with Ryan Clark on “The Pivot Podcast”. There, he mentioned some of his interactions with Los Angeles Lakers legend, LeBron James, and his biased confrontations when it comes to critics. He referred to an incident when the NBA legend approached Smith during a match in March.“You ever see LeBron go at a White boy?” Stephen A. Smith said on the podcast. “Let's call it what it is. You ever see him do that? You'll say you saw him come at me”, he continued. He believes that James’ approach towards critics varies with race, and that’s unfair.Stephen A. Smith had already bashed LeBron James once for chasing stats and comparing himself to Michael Jordan. Smith said, “He’s going to be 41, he’s in his 23rd year, stat-padding his way to make ignorant folks out there think that’s going to make him the GOAT over Jordan — not realizing that most of the stuff it took him 20+ years to do, Jordan did in 13.”Stephen A. Smith also fixated on the fact that LeBron James somehow turned tables and blamed him for something that wasn’t even his fault in the first place. “Anybody with professional ethics, who knows sports and knows what comes with it knows that I did not do anything wrong to that young man”, Smith said. “But to paint me as somebody that would attack a child, just because I dislike you, it's low, it's low”.“That wasn’t a basketball player confronting me. That was a parent. That was a father. I can’t sit here and be angry or feel slighted by LeBron James in that regard”. Smith said. “By all accounts, he’s obviously a wonderful family man and father who cares very, very deeply about his son.” Smith also confronted the fact that James is a great father and a family man.Also read: LeBron and Bronny James’ tentative comeback casts a shadow over Los Angeles Lakers’ preseason finale amidst health concerns",Stephen A.

Tennis star Jannik Sinner secured a commanding victory against Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarter-final round of the Six Kings Slam exhibition tournament in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia , but the match witnessed a security incident when a fan breached protocol to approach the Italian.The defending champion needed only 76 minutes to defeat Tsitsipas, dropping just five games in a dominant performance that set up a semi-final clash with Novak Djokovic.The match itself proceeded smoothly until its conclusion when cameras captured an unauthorised spectator rushing onto the court to approach Sinner during his post-match interview.Sinner initially engaged with the individual, shaking hands and attempting conversation, before realising the person was not tournament staff but rather a fan who had managed to bypass security to request his jacket.The situation, while ultimately harmless, ended with security personnel physically removing the intruding fan from the court area.The incident has raised concerns about security standards at the high-profile exhibition event in Saudi Arabia, with tennis fans drawing parallels to the 1993 Monica Seles incident in Hamburg where she was stabbed by an attacker who breached court security.This marks the second recent security-related incident involving Sinner, following a similar occurrence at the US Open where a fan attempted to access his tennis bag while he was signing autographs.Sinner's performance on court demonstrated his continued strong form, showing no lingering effects from his recent withdrawal from the Shanghai Masters due to injury.","Jannik Sinner defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarter-final round of the Six Kings Slam exhibition tournament in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

World No. 204 Valentin Vacherot from Monaco took the tennis world by storm on Saturday, defeating an ailing Novak Djokovic 6-3, 6-4 in the Shanghai Masters semi-finals. The 26-year-old qualifier overcame the 38-year-old Serbian, who struggled with vomiting, leg injuries, and fatigue under 31°C heat and 62 percent humidity, to book a spot in Sunday’s final against either his cousin Arthur Rinderknech or Daniil Medvedev.“I’m trying to pinch myself, is this real?” Vacherot said after his career-defining win. “To have Novak on the other side of the court was first of all an invaluable experience for me. I have a hundred feelings right now.”But who exactly is Valentin Vacherot? Tennis runs deep in his family. Born in 1998, he started playing at a young age and went on to play college tennis for Texas A&M University. Turning professional in 2022, he is coached by his half-brother Benjamin Balleret, who himself is the son of former players Bernard Balleret and Alexia Dechaume-Balleret. Tennis talent clearly runs in the family, as Vacherot’s cousin Arthur Rinderknech is also a former US Open pre-quarterfinalist.Vacherot first came into the spotlight by winning his maiden ATP Challenger title at the Nonthaburi Challenger in 2022. He made his Grand Slam debut last year at Roland Garros, becoming the first player from the Monegasque Tennis Federation to reach the main draw, though he lost in the first round to Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.Against Djokovic, Vacherot’s composure shone through. After Djokovic broke in the opening game, Vacherot immediately broke back. As Djokovic’s physical troubles worsened in the seventh game, requiring medical treatment and repeated stretches, Vacherot seized the moment, breaking again to take the first set with two aces. Despite a brief resistance from Djokovic in the second set, Vacherot held his nerve to serve out the match, denying Djokovic a chance at a fifth Shanghai Masters title.This remarkable victory cements Vacherot’s arrival on the big stage and marks a career-defining moment for the young Monegasque, whose journey from college tennis to shocking one of the sport’s greatest legends will be remembered for years to come.","Valentin Vacherot beats Novak Djokovic 6-3, 6-4 in the Shanghai Masters semi- finals.

Poll Should Sanju Samson bat at No.3 in the Asia Cup 2025? Yes, he has the experience. No, Tilak Varma should take that spot.

Former India batter Mohammad Kaif has backed Sanju Samson to bat at No.3 ahead of Tilak Varma in the upcoming Asia Cup 2025. India will start their campaign on September 10 against the United Arab Emirates, and Suryakumar Yadav ’s side faces important decisions on their batting order. With Shubman Gill included as vice-captain, it is almost certain that the 25-year-old will open the innings alongside Abhishek Sharma.This leaves Samson’s position in the balance. Over the past year, the 30-year-old has often opened alongside Abhishek. Last year, Samson smashed three T20I centuries, one against Bangladesh and two against South Africa. He has also been in strong form in the Kerala Cricket League. After starting the tournament batting lower down the order, Samson returned to the opening position following two quiet innings and immediately found his rhythm.Tilak Varma, however, has also been in fine touch at No.3 for India. The young left-hander scored back-to-back centuries against South Africa last year, making the selection for the Asia Cup a challenging decision for the management.Kaif shared his view in a video on Instagram, saying, “Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill will open in the Asia Cup. For the No.3 spot, I feel Tilak Varma is a youngster and can wait for his turn.Sanju is an experienced batter, and he could be groomed by giving him consistent opportunities at No.3. There is a World Cup after six months, and he deserves a chance.”Kaif added that Samson would be India’s best bet against a team like Afghanistan, especially when facing a bowler of Rashid Khan ’s calibre. “He is among the top 10 six-hitters in the IPL. That is why I believe when Rashid Khan comes to bowl in the middle overs, there cannot be a better player than Sanju, as he can hit sixes down the ground,” said Kaif.The former India batter also highlighted Samson’s consistency in different conditions. “South Africa has one of the toughest batting conditions, and he scored two centuries as an opener there. He plays both pace and spin well, and in the IPL, he scores 400-500 runs every year,” he said.Kaif further emphasised Samson’s experience and current form, making him hard to overlook in the eight-team tournament that starts on September 9 with Afghanistan facing Hong Kong. “Sanju Samson is the most senior member of this Asia Cup squad. He made his debut in 2015 and was part of the T20 World Cup-winning squad in 2024 in Barbados. He didn’t play every game, but when he did, he scored runs at a 180 strike rate. He has scored a truckload of runs and has been in excellent form in the Kerala Cricket League,” Kaif added.","Former India batter Mohammad Kaif has backed Sanju Samson to bat at No.3 ahead of Tilak Varma in the upcoming Asia Cup 2025.

Poll Do you think India's lack of recent T20 matches will disadvantage them in the Asia Cup? Yes, definitely No, they will be fine

'Gill will try to prove a point'

'Rohit wants to continue playing ODIs'

Heading into the Asia Cup 2025, the defending champions India will still start as favourites. Their record in the continental tournament, too, boosts their credentials, having won it a record eight times.Yet the biggest question is: Are India undercooked? Will adapting to T20I conditions in the UAE prove tricky?India last played a T20I at home against England in February, where they won the five-match series 4-1 with ease. Since then, most players have featured in different formats but not in T20 cricket.In fact, apart from Sanju Samson Suryakumar Yadav , Shivam Dube, and Harshit Rana, no other member of the current 15-man Asia Cup squad has played a T20 match in the build-up to the tournament.Samson has been turning out in the Kerala Cricket League, Rinku in the UPT20, and Rana in the Delhi Premier League. Meanwhile, captain Suryakumar Yadav and Shivam Dube kept themselves sharp in Mumbai’s T20 league.The rest, however, will be returning to the shortest format after a significant break.On the other hand, India’s rivals — Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, hosts UAE, Pakistan and Afghanistan — have all played T20I series during this period, giving them more direct preparation and match awareness ahead of the continental competition.Does this three-month gap from T20 cricket put India at a disadvantage? Will they enter the Asia Cup underdone, giving Pakistan, Afghanistan and others the upper hand?Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan doesn’t think so.Irfan believes the defending champions are well prepared regardless of their lack of match practice. Pathan stressed that India have no reason to be concerned about Pakistan, but they must plan carefully for Afghanistan, whose spinners could thrive on the UAE’s slower pitches.""If there’s one team India needs to be wary of, it’s Afghanistan. On slow pitches, their bowlers can cause real trouble and be very effective on those tracks.""Pakistan, on the other hand, are still trying to regroup. They are searching for leadership and looking for players who can step up and play big roles consistently at the top,"" Irfan told TimesofIndia.com during an interaction organised by Sony Sports.""When it comes to Indian cricket, I feel they are always in touch with the game. The NCA has built a very good system. Contracted players can go there anytime, prepare themselves, undergo fitness tests, and even take part in match simulations.""Recently, a fitness test was conducted at the NCA, and the fact that coaches are available there throughout the year ensures that players always have support,"" he said.""Because of these preparations, there is really nothing to worry about. Indian cricket is at a stage where, even if they are slightly undercooked or haven’t played enough T20 cricket in recent times, it might only affect them at the very start of a tournament. As the competition progresses, I don’t see any issues. The level of preparation these days is outstanding, and for that, I give full credit to the NCA,” he said.There has been plenty of discussion around Shubman Gill’s appointment as vice-captain of the T20I side for the Asia Cup.Irfan believes Gill’s elevation as deputy to Suryakumar Yadav will do a “world of good” to the Indian team. The Test captain, fresh from a stellar batting performance in England that helped India draw the series 2-2, will now look to “prove a point” in the shortest format.“This selection of Shubman Gill as vice-captain would not have happened without the consent of Suryakumar Yadav. His (Suryakumar’s) responsibility is not only to perform and look after the team, but at the same time grow leadership, grow the team and he has started doing that. People might think that puts pressure on him, but what he is doing is actually doing a world of good for Indian cricket in the long term, and it will establish Suryakumar Yadav as a proper leader who is respected, especially in the cricketing community,” he said.“What we have seen this season, the way he played, the amount of runs he scored in the last few seasons in the IPL as well. Now the Indian team has moved towards playing at a higher strike rate. They want to be very aggressive. I don’t think there will be an issue for Gill to start playing an aggressive role and do what the team demands of him. More than anyone else in this group, Gill will go there and try to prove a point in terms of playing aggressive cricket. He has the ability and he has got a lot of range,” he added.Pathan revealed Rohit Sharma , who has retired from T20Is and Tests, has expressed his wish to continue playing ODIs for as long as possible but said getting game-time will be a challenge for the former captain and even Virat Kohli.“This new fitness test is obviously not easy, so once you're able to clear it, that means your fitness is top-notch. I had a long call with him as well, just to know about his future plans. He’s very keen. He wants to make sure that he continues playing. As long as the player is fit, age doesn’t matter. But the challenge will be for him to get enough game-time. Playing for India, I don’t think there will be any issues with motivation,"" Pathan said.“Be it Rohit, be it Virat or be it Mohammed Shami as well, the question is how much game-time they will have and how long they can continue playing cricket in whatever form, because they have retired from Test cricket and T20 Internationals as well,” Pathan said.","India last played a T20I at home against England in February. Apart from Sanju Samson Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, and Harshit Rana, no other member of the current 15-man Asia Cup squad has played T20 match in the build-up to the tournament.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123667058,imgsize-189234,width-400,resizemode-4/india-v-england-4th-t20i.jpg"

Poll Do you think bowlers should show more personality on the field? Yes, it's entertaining. No, they should remain professional. Depends on the situation.

Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin commented on the incident, noting that people seemed irritated by Rathi showing personality as a bowler. However, Ashwin praised Rana for the way he handled questions from the media after the match.Speaking on his YouTube channel ‘Ash Ki Baat’, Ashwin said, “I just want to say one thing. In our beloved sport, if a bowler does something and emerges as a character, we are not always willing to accept it. Maybe in this case the fault would lie with the spinner, but the respect for Rana has grown in my eyes.”Ashwin added, “It was Rana’s day. He hit 15 sixes. After the game, he was asked ‘What happened?’ The way he handled it was amazing. He said the fault could have been his or Digvesh’s. But he said he was playing to help his team win, and Digvesh was doing that for his team. That spirit and heat are needed to play this game. It was easy for him to throw dirt on Digvesh Rathi, but he didn’t do it and deflected the question.”Rana also spoke to PTI about the incident. He said, “We were both trying to win the match for our respective teams, but above all, we have to respect the game of cricket.He was the one who initiated things, though I won’t go into how. If someone tries to provoke me, I won’t just take it quietly. That’s how I’ve played my cricket throughout. I can also hit sixes and respond in kind. I’ve been involved in many fights, but I’ve never been the one to start them. However, if someone tries to poke me, I will give a proper response.”The league penalised both players for breaching the code of conduct. Rathi was fined 80 percent of his match fee for a Level 2 breach, while Rana was fined 50 percent for Level 1 breaches. On the field, Rana had the last laugh.His 134 off just 55 balls helped West Delhi Lions chase down 202 and eliminate Rathi’s South Delhi Superstarz. West Delhi then went on to beat East Delhi Riders in Qualifier 2 and defeated Central Delhi Kings by six wickets in the finals.","Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin commented on the incident.

Afghanistan's star spinner Rashid Khan achieved a historic milestone by becoming the leading wicket-taker in T20 internationals as he guided his team to a 38-run victory over the United Arab Emirates in Sharjah on Monday. The 26-year-old claimed figures of 3/21, helping restrict UAE to 150/8 in their chase of 189, while surpassing New Zealand's Tim Southee 's record of 164 T20I wickets.Afghanistan posted a competitive total of 188/4 after being put in to bat, with Ibrahim Zadran scoring a quick-fire 63 off 40 balls and Sediqullah Atal contributing his maiden T20I fifty with 54 runs from 40 deliveries. The pair established a crucial 84-run partnership for the second wicket.UAE captain Muhammad Waseem provided early resistance in the chase with an aggressive 67 off 37 balls, including six sixes and four boundaries, marking his 23rd T20I half-century. However, his dismissal triggered a collapse in the UAE innings.Rashid Khan's record-breaking performance came as he dismissed Ethan D'Souza (12), Asif Khan (1), and Dhruv Parashar (1) in quick succession. His three-wicket haul took his career tally to 165 wickets in 98 T20Is, overtaking Southee's previous record of 164 wickets in 126 matches.The Afghan innings was further bolstered by Karim Janat's explosive cameo of 23 not out from 10 balls, featuring two sixes and two boundaries.

Jannik Sinner, World No. 1, swept into the US Open quarter-finals with a dominant 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 win over Alexander Bublik, the Kazakh who had upset expectations by taking a late-night route to the match.The match lasted just 1 hour and 21 minutes, the second-fastest contest in the men’s singles so far this year. Moments after the defeat, Bublik, seeded 23rd, left a comment reading “AI” on the US Open’s Instagram post announcing Sinner’s win.Bublik is one of only two players to defeat Sinner this season, but the 24-year-old Italian made sure there would be no upset this time in New York.“We’ve had tough battles this year, but we know each other’s games really well,” Sinner said.He has already claimed the Australian Open and Wimbledon titles this year. “He had a tough match in the third round, five sets, finishing late, and he didn’t serve as well as usual. Overall I’m very happy.”With this win, Sinner extended his hard-court Grand Slam winning streak to 25 matches, converting eight of 17 break opportunities.Before the match, Bublik had won all 55 of his service games in the tournament, underlining the challenge he faced.He emphasised holding serve early, but after finishing his previous match around 1:15 a.m. local time, he appeared unsettled.Sinner’s response began with a break in the first game, aided by sloppy groundstrokes and a double fault on break point. From there, Sinner’s athleticism neutralised Bublik’s dropshots and creative serves, while his relentless baseline power kept the pressure high.Bublik fought to stay in it, even managing a smile and a light-hearted exchange with Sinner at the net after defeat, saying, “You’re so good, this is insane. I’m not bad but what the ....”One bright moment for Bublik came as he avoided the fastest loss of the tournament, saving three break points to hold for 4-1 in the final set and lengthen the proceedings slightly past 1 hour 20 minutes—the mark set when Czech 21st seed Tomas Machac defeated Italy’s Luca Nardi in the first round.Sinner will continue his pursuit of another title run as he faces 10th seed Lorenzo Musetti in the all-Italian quarter-final.","World No. 1 Jannik Sinner beat Alexander Bublik 6-1, 6-2, 6 -1 at the US Open.

The long shadow of a decade-old case involving former India fast bowler S Sreesanth has once again reached the Supreme Court , pulling the Rajasthan Royals into the spotlight.Back in 2012, Sreesanth was ruled out of the IPL season after suffering a knee injury during a practice match in Jaipur. The Royals, who had insured their players under a special contingency policy worth over Rs 8.7 crore, filed a claim of around Rs 82 lakh, arguing that the injury left him unfit to participate that year.The insurance company, however, saw things differently. United India Insurance rejected the claim, insisting that Sreesanth was already carrying a toe injury from 2011, which had not been disclosed when the policy was taken. According to them, this prior injury could have affected his availability, making the Royals’ claim invalid.The matter went before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, which sided with the franchise and ordered the insurer to pay. But the company has since appealed to the Supreme Court, where the case is now being revisited.In court, the Royals maintained that the toe injury never stopped Sreesanth from playing and that the only reason he missed the season was the fresh knee injury suffered during the insured period.Their counsel even pointed out that fitness certificates were submitted at the time of insurance, with the next one arriving after the knee injury.The bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta questioned whether the toe injury had been formally disclosed. They also noted that if the insurer had known of the injury, they could have refused coverage or charged a higher premium.For now, the matter remains unresolved. The Supreme Court has asked the insurance firm to produce additional documents, including Sreesanth’s fitness certificates and the original application for the policy. Until then, the decade-old dispute between a cricket franchise and its insurer continues to linger, with the Royals still waiting on an answer to their claim.","Sreesanth was ruled out of the 2012 IPL season with a knee injury.

India’s Gaming Revolution: New Law Changes EVERYTHING

The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has invited bids for the Indian cricket team's title sponsorship after Dream11's withdrawal due to the government's ban on real money gaming. The board has explicitly banned companies involved in real money gaming and cryptocurrency from participating in the bidding process, which comes after Dream11's recent closure of its real money games following the implementation of the 'Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act 2025'.Dream11 and My11Circle had been significant contributors to Indian cricket, jointly providing approximately Rs 1,000 crore through title sponsorship of both the national team and the Indian Premier League.The BCCI has set clear guidelines for potential bidders in its press release: ""Bidder, including any of its Group companies: (i) should not be engaged in online money gaming, betting or gambling services or similar services in India or anywhere in the world; (ii) should not provide any online money gaming, betting or gambling services or similar services to any Person in India; and (iii) should not have any investment or ownership interest in any Person engaged in betting or gambling services in India.The board has established September 12 as the deadline for purchasing the IEOI, with bid document submissions due by September 16.The BCCI further clarified: ""To clarify, a bidder, including any of its Group companies, engaged in any activities/business that is prohibited under the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act, 2025 is not permitted to submit a bid.""The board has also excluded companies dealing in tobacco, alcohol, and content that could ""offend public morals"" from the bidding process.Several brand categories are blocked due to existing BCCI sponsorships, including athleisure and sportswear manufacturers, banking and financial services, non-alcoholic cold beverages, fans, mixer grinders, safety locks, and insurance.Current BCCI partners in these categories include Adidas, Campa Cola, IDFC First Bank, and SBI Life.The board has specifically addressed multiple brand operations: ""Bidder operating or engaged in multiple brand/product categories, one of which falls under either the Blocked Brand Categories or Prohibited Brand Categories, shall not be permitted to submit a bid in respect of such Blocked Brand Categories or Prohibited Brand Categories.""The BCCI has also prohibited surrogate branding: ""Bidders are prohibited from submitting bids through surrogate brands. Surrogate branding refers to any attempt to indirectly submit a bid on behalf of a different entity or Person through the use of a different entity or person. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of different names, brands, identity or logos.""Financial eligibility criteria require bidders to have either an average turnover or net worth of at least Rs 300 crore over the last three years.The BCCI maintains the right to modify or cancel the IEOI process at any stage without explanation.Dream11 had previously secured the rights for USD 44 million (Rs 358 crore) for 2023-2026 but is exiting early with approximately one year remaining.A senior BCCI official, speaking anonymously to PTI, explained: ""The BCCI fully understands one of our sponsorship partner's plight.

NEW DELHI: Bronco Test has created a lot of buzz in the Indian cricket set-up. The introduction of the rugby-style Bronco Test in the Indian cricketing system, by the current Indian Strength and Conditioning coach Adrian Le Roux, has received mixed reactions.Former India off-spinner R Ashwin and legendary South African cricketer AB de Villiers called it a ""big problem"" and said it is going to be very ""demanding"" for the cricketers.""It’s one of the worst you can do,"" de Villiers said on his YouTube channel.

Because I went through a cycle from 2017 to 2019, I was searching for my training schema because I was constantly injured.""The Bronco Test, mainly adopted by rugby teams, consists of repeated shuttle runs over distances of 20, 40, and 60 metres.In the test, the runner sprints from 0 to 60 metres and back, then to 40 metres and back, followed by 20 metres and back -- completing 240 metres in one set. The full test comprises five such sets, adding up to 1,200 metres of continuous running without rest.Ramji Srinivasan, who was India's Strength and Conditioning coach during the 2011 World Cup, feels the Bronco Test was much needed in the Indian cricketing system.""Bronco is a running-based fitness test, basically,"" Ramji tells TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""(It has) Been used for a long time by the rugby teams and mostly rugby teams because it's a continuous, fast, endurance work, which is of good intensity. And you need to cover a distance in a particular time frame. It's a time-trial-based protocol, which is one of the best things to be introduced for cricket, especially for fast bowlers and also for the batters.""It gives you your aerobic fitness value and your fatigue index value, your anaerobic threshold value. But at the same time, it doesn't give you a reading on agility, a reading on your explosive power or reading on your reactive strength, or your flexibility or your balance or stability or your acceleration. It doesn't give you those readings.""And there is no way to cheat in this. You cannot cut corners here. It's all time-bound. Within a certain time period, you have to finish. If you want to be at an elite level of athlete or what a lot of players claim to be at an elite level, you have to finish under 4 minutes 30 seconds, the entire distance, which then you can be calibrated as an elite-level athlete. So, it clearly demarcates your fitness levels, where you need to be, and gives you a very realistic picture of what one player needs to improve on,"" he explains.Former India Strength and Conditioning coach Soham Desai, who was part of the Team India set-up for five years before Adrian Le Roux replaced him, says it is just another fitness test.""In India, there is no set structure or there is no set norm,"" he tells TimesofIndia.com.""Adrian has come in. Now, we cannot blame him or we cannot say that why Adrian has brought a new test. It has been introduced because Adrian is comfortable with that test. In Yo-Yo or Bronco or in a two-kilometre run or in a beep test, all these things are tools.""Bronco is something which is predominantly used in a rugby setting or rugby environment because their game is such, their system is such that they have been doing it for years. And that is something you don't need audio, you don't need any apparatus to conduct that test. You can just put two cones, you have a stopwatch, you are good to go.""So, I have also done that with the boys or even Adrian would have done it with the boys without telling them that it is a Bronco Test, as just a conditioning training session for them,"" he adds.""Adrian is familiar with the test. And he wants to use the test to assess the fitness of a player. There is nothing right or wrong about it.""It is just a question of a coach being comfortable with a particular kind of way. There is nothing to read between the lines or nothing that is leading us somewhere.""Ramji Srinivasan strongly believes the Bronco Test is going to be tough for ageing superstars like Mohammed Shami and Rohit Sharma ""A 19-year-old boy's reading on Bronco will be completely different from a 37-year-old man's (reading),"" he says.""Players who are 35-and-above need to have a different cut-off point, different standardisation. Because over the years they have been playing, they may be carrying niggles, their body may not respond. We have to have a separate standardisation for those people, those who are above 30.""I think it's a good thing to have for a 20-year-old youth, but you cannot compare him to a 40-year-old player,"" he warns.Desai believes the Bronco Test is not going to be a selection parameter, nor was the Yo-Yo test after the 2019 ODI World Cup.""Bronco is not a test in which a player will be selected or not selected. Nor is it the case with Yo-Yo at the moment,"" he says.""During Virat Kohli, Ravi Shastri’s time, they directed Shankar Basu to get fitness to a level leading into the 2019 World Cup.""Those numbers were agreed with all the stakeholders involved and they wanted to keep it a serious affair so that people leading into the 2019 World Cup come to a particular level and then we play the World Cup. That was the whole vision. That's why those numbers were agreed upon and shared and it became a selection criteria.""But after that, we have done the Yo-Yo test three times a year for almost all contracted players every year. But it was never a selection criteria. It is a fitness assessment parameter where we as coaches, as people working in NCA (BCCI's CoE), get an idea, a snapshot about their fitness at that particular level,"" he explains.In a startling revelation, Srinivasan says cricketers won't be able to cheat in Bronco like they used to cut corners in the Yo-Yo Test.""There are so many variables in Yo-Yo,"" says Ramji.""First of all, where you do Yo-Yo, whether you are doing it indoors or outdoors, that is one. Second thing, the ground conditions, which ground, where you are doing. For example, two or three grounds next to each other may have different surfaces. So, what you do in one ground, ground A, next test you go in ground B, the reading may differ. It may be more or it may be less. You cannot standardise that. So, you have to do it on the ground where you have done it to get the standardisation.""Third, the type of surface, whether you are doing it on grass, whether you are doing it on red soil, whether you are doing it on a ground, the basic surface matters.""Fourth is your humidity factor. What is the level of humidity when you are doing the testing? Fifth is your weather, whether you are doing it in the morning, afternoon, evening or late night, those things matter.""And you can steal inches here and there in the Yo-Yo Test. Bronco is really hard-hitting. Unless and until you are at a good level of fitness, when you try to push, you can get injured. You have to be at a good level of fitness to do a Bronco. You know, it is not just a test for weak hearts,"" he continued.","Bronco Test has created a lot of buzz in the Indian cricket set-up. Former India off-spinner R Ashwin and legendary South African cricketer AB de Villiers called it a ""big problem"" The Bronco Test consists of repeated shuttle runs over distances of 20, 40, and 60 metres.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123668945,imgsize-54766,width-400,resizemode-4/indian-team-fitness-test-ig.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A one-minute silence was observed at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium before the start of the Pakistan-Afghanistan Tri-Series match, in memory of the victims of the devastating earthquake in Afghanistan and the floods in Pakistan. Players from both sides lined up solemnly as a mark of respect to those who lost their lives in the twin tragedies.Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan also expressed his grief on social media, posting an emotional message. “Heartbroken for my people in Kunar after the devastating earthquake,” Rashid wrote, as prayers and condolences poured in from across the cricketing world.The 6.0-magnitude earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan late on Sunday, flattening entire villages and leaving widespread destruction in its wake. According to officials, at least 800 people have been confirmed dead, while more than 2,500 others have been injured. The toll is expected to rise as rescue operations continue in remote, mountainous regions.The epicenter was located near Jalalabad, an eastern city of about 200,000 residents, less than 100 miles from Kabul and close to the Pakistan border. The shallow depth of just five miles made the quake particularly destructive.Videos shared on social media showed residents rushing through the night to rescue neighbors trapped beneath collapsed mud and brick houses. The United Nations confirmed that four eastern provinces — Nangarhar, Nuristan, Laghman and Kunar — have been badly affected. Dozens of villages in Kunar were reduced to rubble.Strong tremors were felt across the region, including parts of Pakistan, though no major casualties were reported there. Meanwhile, international aid has been slow to arrive, with only a handful of countries so far offering assistance to the Taliban-led Afghan government.As the cricket went ahead in Sharjah, the sombre scenes served as a reminder of the human suffering unfolding across the border.","A one-minute silence was observed at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium before the start of the Pakistan-Afghanistan Tri-Series match.

NEW DELHI: South Africa produced a clinical performance to crush England by seven wickets in the opening one-day international at Headingley on Tuesday. The contest was effectively decided inside the first half of the day, as the visitors bundled England out for a paltry 131 before racing to victory with almost 30 overs to spare.Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj (4/22) and all-rounder Wiaan Mulder (3/33) ripped through England’s fragile batting line-up after captain Temba Bavuma opted to field under heavy clouds in Leeds.England’s innings never recovered after slipping to 82/2. From there, the last eight wickets tumbled for just 49 runs. Debutant Sonny Baker endured a nightmare introduction to international cricket, falling first ball before conceding 76 runs in his seven overs. Only opener Jamie Smith (54) offered resistance, with Jos Buttler (15) the next-best contributor.South Africa’s chase was led by a blistering innings from Aiden Markram , who smashed a 23-ball half-century and went on to score 86, laced with eight fours and two sixes. He took a particular liking to Baker, dispatching the young pacer all around the ground. Markram eventually fell to a superb diving catch by Smith off Adil Rashid (3/26), but by then the target was in sight.Rashid gave the Headingley crowd a brief lift, striking twice in two balls with the scores level.However, Dewald Brevis ended any hopes of late drama, launching the next delivery for six to seal the win in emphatic fashion.The result brought Harry Brook’s six-match unbeaten run as England’s white-ball captain to a shuddering halt. England also paid the price for lack of preparation, having had no 50-over cricket ahead of this series, while South Africa arrived buoyed by a 2-1 triumph in Australia.Despite the absence of pace spearheads Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen, the Proteas showed their depth, with Maharaj underlining his world No.1 ODI bowler status by closing the innings with successive strikes – trapping Rashid lbw before bowling Baker to finish things off in the 25th over.The three-match series now moves to Lord’s, where England will look to regroup on Thursday.","South Africa crush England by seven wickets in the opening one-day international at Headingley.

Poll Who do you think handled the on-field altercation better? Nitish Rana Digvesh Rathi

Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has commended Nitish Rana for the way he handled himself after an on-field altercation with Digvesh Rathi during the Delhi Premier League Eliminator.The contest between West Delhi Lions and South Delhi Superstarz saw tempers flare when Rana, after hitting Rathi for a six, mimicked the spinner’s signature notebook celebration. Rathi reacted angrily, leading to a heated exchange where both players had to be separated by teammates and officials.Despite the intensity of the clash, Rana refrained from escalating the matter in his post-match comments. He said he would never back down if provoked but stopped short of blaming Rathi directly. Ashwin, speaking on his YouTube channel Ash Ki Baat, lauded this restraint.“I just want to say one thing, in our beloved sport, if a bowler does something, if he emerges as a character, we are not willing to accept that. Maybe in the case of this fight between Nitish Rana and Rathi, the fault would lie with the spinner. But the respect for Rana has grown in my eyes,” Ashwin said.He highlighted how Rana managed the situation after a dominant performance with the bat.“It was Rana's day. He hit 15 sixes. After the game, he was asked ‘What happened?’ The way he handled it was amazing. He said the fault could have been his or Digvesh's. But he said that he was playing to help his team win, and Digvesh was doing that for his team. That spirit and heat are needed to play this game,” Ashwin noted.Both players were fined for the incident, with Rathi losing 80 percent of his match fees, while Rana was docked 50 percent. Still, Ashwin felt Rana showed maturity. “My respect for Nitish Rana has grown multi-fold. As a spectacle, we all like to see this, but the matter of fact is that we don't have to character assassinate anyone. It is very easy to bring someone down when you are in the euphoria of a win. But he chose not to do that,” he said.West Delhi Lions went on to lift the DPL 2025 title.","Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has commended Nitish Rana for the way he handled himself after an on-field altercation with Digvesh Rathi.

NEW DELHI: At just 14, Vaibhav Suryavanshi is already creating waves in the cricketing world. With a baby face but fearless power-hitting, the youngster has stunned everyone with his maturity and skill. The 14-year-old truly announced his arrival on the big stage in the IPL 2025 season, where he smashed a blistering century. His sensational 101 off just 38 balls made him the youngest ever to score a century in the tournament’s history.What made the knock even more remarkable was the pace at which it was scored. That innings went down as the second-fastest century in IPL history, behind only Chris Gayle’s iconic 30-ball hundred.For a teenager to etch his name alongside Gayle in the record books speaks volumes about the kind of prodigious talent Suryavanshi is. His fearless approach and ability to clear the boundary at will have made him an instant fan favourite, with many already touting him as the future of Indian cricket. Nitish Rana , who represents Rajasthan Royals in the IPL and has kept a close eye on Suryavanshi’s progress, couldn’t resist joking about the youngster’s age.“Is Suryavanshi really 14 years old?” he asked with a laugh, capturing the disbelief that many feel when watching the teenager bat.After leading West Delhi Lions, Nitish took part in a rapid-fire round where he was asked several questions, including one about Suryavanshi. Without hesitation, he laughed and said: “Wo 14 saal ka hi hai ki nahi?”When asked to share one thing the world doesn’t know about Sanju Samson , Nitish teased: “Next year wo kaha khelne waala hai?”He also opened up about his Rajasthan Royals teammate Riyan Parag “Jaisa wo dikhta hai wo waise hai nahi. Real life mein wo bahot soft as in bahot achhey se baat karta hai. Uska attitude shayad TV pe galat tarike se dikhta hai. But wo waisa hai nahi,” he said.For Nitish, though, the game itself remains above everything else. “Cricket se bada kuch nahi hai. Game bahot bada hai kisi bhi match se, kisi bhi player se, kisi bhi cheez se. Cricket ko maine waha dekha hai jaha pe na maine apne aap ko dekha hai, na apne khaandaan ko and na kisi aur ko. Cricket mere liye top pe hai,” he said passionately.","At just 14, Vaibhav Suryavanshi is already creating waves in the cricketing world.

Poll Do you believe Rajeev Shukla is the right choice for BCCI president? Yes No

: With the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) Annual General Meeting (AGM) due shortly, the board has got into a huddle to identify a new set of office bearers. The post for president has been left vacant for a couple of months now after Roger Binny turned 70. Incumbent vice-president Rajeev Shukla has been filling in for Binny since. It is learnt that the forces in the BCCI are discussing if Shukla can be formally elevated to the post of president.TOI has learnt that Shukla is a serious contender for the post given his vast experience as a cricket administrator.""Rajeev Shukla stands a very good chance to be elected as the BCCI president in the election due to happen later this month,"" a source told TOI.Shukla had chaired the BCCI's apex council meeting last Wednesday as Binny, who was a part of the Indian team that won the 1983 World Cup, turned 70 - the cut-off date for any BCCI or state association post - on July 19.Shukla, who served as the chairman of the Indian Premier League in 2015, was elected unopposed as the BCCI vice-president in Dec 2020.TOI has also learnt that current IPL chairman Arun Dhumal and former BCCI treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry could be in the fray for the position of BCCI secretary.However, the chances of incumbent secretary Devajit Saikia continuing in that post cannot be ruled out. It is also learnt that Chaudhry ‘s name has also been doing the rounds as a probable candidate to become the IPL chairman. Dhumal became the IPL chairman in 2022 and had served as BCCI treasurer for three years before that. ""Apparently, there's some confusion around whether Dhumal is supposed to serve a cooling period. Things will become clearer in the next few days,"" a source said.Saikia, a former Assam wicketkeeper, was elected as the secretary of the BCCI on Jan 12, 2025. ""Saikia has done a good job so far in the almost nine months that he has been in charge, driving the BCCI efficiently through a period where a lot has happened both on and off the field in Indian cricket. There's no reason to believe that he can't continue as the BCCI secretary,"" say those tracking developments.A seasoned cricket administrator, Saikia was previously the BCCI joint secretary and secretary of the Assam Cricket Association. After the election of the former BCCI secretary Jay Shah to the position of Chair of the International Cricket Council, he also served as the acting interim secretary of the BCCI, before becoming the secretary of the Board.Meanwhile, Goa's Rohan Desai is expected to continue as the joint secretary of the BCCI and Chhattisgarh's Prabhtej Singh Bhatia is likely to stay as the BCCI treasurer.",The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) Annual General Meeting (AGM) due shortly.

Poll How do you feel about the AIFF's ability to handle the upcoming football season? Very confident Not confident They cannot

: The uncertainty surrounding Indian football is expected to end with the Supreme Court directing the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to take necessary measures for start of the season and issue tenders inviting bids for new commercial partners.In April this year, Supreme Court had directed the AIFF “not to enter into any binding contracts till the judgment (on the draft constitution) is pronounced.”The direction brought football to a standstill since the AIFF’s 15-year contract with FSDL, its marketing partners, was to end in December this year. The next edition of the top-tier Indian Super League (ISL) was then kept on hold, prompting three clubs to suspend player salaries. Six others have not yet started pre-season training.On the directions of the Supreme Court, AIFF and FSDL then came up with a consensual resolution which the court felt was “compelling and necessary” to break the impasse.“We direct AIFF to take such measures as may be necessary for timely commencement of football calendar and to maintain competitive continuity for the 2025-2026 season with respect to Super Cup and other competitions under its control,” the Supreme Court said in an order on Tuesday.The apex court also asked AIFF to “issue tenders inviting bids for open, competitive and transparent process for selection of its commercial partner to conduct Indian Super League.”The order issued on Tuesday does not prohibit AIFF from seeking long-term commercial partners, neither does it make a mention of fresh elections, despite arguments from senior lawyers that the “present committee was elected for three months but now it’s been three years.”Former Justice (Retd.) L. Nageswara Rao has been appointed to ensure that the selection process “enures in identifying a competent, reputed and an efficient firm as a commercial partner to conduct ISL, in line with global best practices.”“The Supreme Court order comes as a huge relief for Indian football and we can now begin work on commencing the season,” AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey told TOI on Tuesday. ""For some months now, player salaries were on hold and there was uncertainty too with clubs hesitant to even start pre-season. Now the road is clear. AIFF will ensure that players get enough competitive matches, starting with the Super Cup.”Meanwhile, AIFF is anxiously waiting for the final order on the all-important constitution, a case which is pending in the apex court since 2017, when the court directed formulation of a new constitution.FIFA has given AIFF a deadline of October 30 to secure a definitive order from the Supreme Court approving the revised AIFF constitution and then get it ratified by the general body. Failure to adhere to its obligation, “may result in sanctions outlined in the FIFA and AFC Statutes, including the possibility of suspension.”","Supreme Court orders All India Football Federation (AIFF) to take necessary measures for start of the season and issue tenders inviting bids for new commercial partners.

Poll Should the EFL consider expelling Grimsby Town for fielding an ineligible player? Yes, they should No, it isn't that serious

Grimsby Town have been fined £20,000 (₹ 23,54,698) by the English Football League (EFL) after fielding an ineligible player during their Carabao Cup victory over Manchester United The League Two side stunned United in the second round, winning on penalties after a 2-2 draw in normal time. But their success was overshadowed when it emerged that midfielder Clarke Oduor, who had joined on loan from Bradford City, had been registered one minute and 59 seconds after the competition’s noon deadline.Grimsby admitted the error and self-reported the breach. The EFL confirmed: “The club’s non-compliance was not deliberate with no intention to deceive or mislead.” The Mariners must pay £10,000 immediately, with a further £10,000 suspended until the end of the season.In a statement, Grimsby explained: “The registration was submitted to the EFL at one minute past the deadline and the issue was not immediately identified by the club due to a computer problem being experienced. We accept the fine imposed and fully recognise the importance of adhering to competition rules.”The club added that they had reviewed internal processes: “This mistake was not deliberate, and the club acted transparently by self-reporting the breach as soon as it came to light.Since this incident, we have undertaken a thorough review of our processes and implemented strengthened measures to ensure it cannot happen again. We thank the EFL board for recognising our co-operation and intent.”Manchester United declined to comment on the matter but, under EFL rules, they have until next Monday to appeal the decision. The EFL stressed the fine “followed precedent” after reviewing the case and comparing it with similar offences.On three previous occasions, clubs have been punished but allowed to progress after fielding ineligible players in the League Cup. Liverpool, Accrington Stanley and Sunderland were all fined but not expelled, with each of them having also won their respective ties.David Artell’s Grimsby side will now meet Sheffield Wednesday, who are struggling in the Championship, in the third round later this month.","Grimsby Town have been fined £20,000 by the English Football League (EFL) The League Two side fielded an ineligible player during their Carabao Cup victory over Manchester United.

The 2025 summer transfer window has closed and it’s been a big one. The English Premier League broke its £2.36 billion single-window record from 2023, with Liverpool alone responsible for around £450 million of that, including splashing roughly £130 million on British-record signing Alexander Isak from Newcastle United.Isak’s deal was confirmed on transfer deadline day, while £55 million Brentford striker Yoane Wissa replaced him at Newcastle. But Crystal Palace defender Marc Guéhi did not get his £35 million move to Anfield as it collapsed in the final hours because Palace couldn’t find a replacement.Elsewhere, Manchester United sold Rasmus Højlund to Napoli and Anthony to Real Betis, while bringing in Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens for around £18 million.Chelsea offloaded striker Nicolas Jackson to Bayern Munich and banked a £15 million loan fee, with an option to make it permanent for £56 million next summer. They also signed Facundo Buonanotte on loan from Brighton and sent young winger Tyrique George to Fulham for £22 million, making them the first club to bank over £300 million in player exits in a single window.Tottenham completed a loan deal for PSG striker Randal Kolo Muani, and London rivals Arsenal landed Bayer Leverkusen defender Piero Hincapie on loan, with an option to sign him next year for around £45 million.Manchester City’s £25 million deal for PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma saw Ederson exit for Galatasaray and Inter Milan move for City defender Manuel Akanji on loan, while City midfielder Issa Kabore joined Wrexham on loan.Liverpool saved the biggest transfer until last in its remarkable $570 million summer spree, finally signing Alexander Isak from Newcastle for a British-record fee.The biggest saga of Europe's summer transfer window ended with Isak completing his dream move to the English champion for 125 million pounds ($170 million).One transfer Liverpool failed to get over the line, however, was for England defender Marc Guehi, who will stay at Crystal Palace for the final year of his contract because the London team couldn't secure a replacement.Manchester City have confirmed the signing of Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris Saint-Germain on a five-year contract until 2030, following Ederson's departure. The 26-year-old goalkeeper, standing at 6ft 5ins, brings extensive experience from his time at AC Milan and PSG, where he achieved multiple domestic titles and a UEFA Champions League trophy.Donnarumma spent four seasons in France, helping PSG secure four Ligue One titles, two Coupe de France victories, three Trophee des Champions titles, and their first UEFA Champions League trophy last season.""To have signed for Manchester City is such a special and proud moment for me. I am joining a squad packed with world-class talent and a team led by the one of the greatest managers in the history of football in Pep Guardiola. This is a club every player in world football would love to join,"" Donnarumma said.Manuel Akanji has joined Italian club Inter Milan on a season-long loan deal from Manchester City.The Swiss international moved to City from Borussia Dortmund in September 2022 and has made 136 appearances for the Blues.He won seven trophies during his time at the Etihad Stadium playing a major part in their historic treble during his debut season and the following campaign when they became the first English men’s team to win four league titles in a row.In total, Akanji has lifted two Premier League titles, one UEFA Champions League, one FIFA Club World Cup, one FA Cup, one Community Shield and one UEFA Super Cup during a memorable campaign in Manchester.Former Arsenal and Barcelona star Alexis Sanchez has joined Sevilla from Udinese, the Spanish club said.The announcement came just hours after Udinese said he was leaving the Serie A club by mutual consent.The Chilean, who also represented Manchester United, Inter Milan and Marseille in his career, had returned to Udinese for a second spell a year ago.It will be the 26-year-old's fifth club in two years having moved from Roma to the Turkish side in 2023 before being loaned out to Aston Villa, Atalanta and then Fiorentina.He went on to win La Liga with Barca in 2013, Serie A with Inter Milan in 2021 and 2024, and the FA Cup with Arsenal in 2015 and 2017.Jamie Vardy, the veteran English forward whose goals fired Leicester City to an unlikely Premier League title truimph in 2016, joined newly promoted Serie A side Cremonese.Vardy, 38, a free agent since leaving Leicester in May, put pen to paper on a one-year contract with an option to extend just hours before the transfer window closed.Newcastle signed DR Congo forward Yoane Wissa from Brentford in a £50 million ($67 million) deal after Alexander Isak left St James' Park.Wissa agreed a long-term contract with the Magpies and will wear Newcastle's famous number nine shirt.The 28-year-old's eventual fee could rise to £55 million depending on add-on clauses.Manchester United on Monday completed the deadline-day signing of Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens, also moving on big-money flops Rasmus Hojlund, Antony and Jadon Sancho.Amorim was also keen to boost his goalkeeping options after poor starts to the season for Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.A variety of options were reportedly considered, including Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez, before a deal was done for Lammens for 21 million euros ($24.6 million) plus add-ons.Hojlund has joined Napoli on loan while Sancho has signed for Villa until the end of the season. Real Betis announced the signing of Brazil international winger Antony on a five-year deal.Bayern Munich on Monday announced the signing of striker Nicolas Jackson on a season-long loan from Chelsea, days after it appeared that the Premier League club had cancelled the move.The announcement, coming hours after the transfer window closed, ended days of uncertainty for the 24-year-old Senegal striker.After Jackson arrived in Munich on Saturday, Chelsea decided to cancel the loan deal and recall the player, saying that an injury to forward Liam Delap had forced their hand.Bayern said they would honour Chelsea's request but Jackson refused to return to London, with his agent making several public statements hoping that the move would still go ahead.On Monday, Bayern reportedly agreed to a loan fee of 16.5 million euros ($19 million), 1.5 million higher than the previous arrangement.The loan fee paid by Bayern is the highest in the club's history, eclipsing the 13 million euros paid in 2017 to Real Madrid for James Rodriguez.Jadon Sancho joined Aston Villa on a season-long loan from Manchester United. The 25-year-old has joined Unai Emery's side after spending last season on loan at Chelsea, where he helped the club win the UEFA Conference League.Sancho's move to Villa means he follows in the footsteps of his former Manchester United teammate Marcus Rashford who also made a temporary switch to Birmingham during the second half of the last campaign. Rashford is now at Barcelona.Arsenal signed Ecuador defender Piero Hincapie on a season-long loan from Bayer Leverkusen. Hincapie can make a permanent move to Arsenal for £45 million ($60 million) at the end of the current campaign.The 23-year-old made more than 100 appearances for Leverkusen after joining the German club in 2021 and played a key role in their Bundesliga title victory in 2023-24.Paris Saint-Germain playmaker Marco Asensio has joined Turkish side Fenerbahce. ""Our club has reached an agreement with Paris Saint-Germain for the permanent transfer of Spanish midfielder Marco Asensio,"" Fenerbahce posted on social media, without disclosing the fee paid for the Spaniard.Asensio spent the second half of last season on loan at Premier League side Aston Villa, notching eight goals in 21 appearances in all competitions.","The 2025 summer transfer window has closed and it’s been a big one.

Poll How many trophies do you think Donnarumma will help Manchester City win by 2030? 1-3 trophies 4-6 trophies 7 or more trophies

Manchester City have completed the signing of Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris Saint-Germain, the club confirmed on Tuesday, just hours after announcing Ederson’s departure.The 26-year-old has signed a contract until the summer of 2030, with the move subject to international clearance. Standing at 6ft 5in, Donnarumma arrives at the Etihad with considerable experience at the highest level across Serie A, Ligue 1 and European competitions.He replaces Ederson, who leaves the club as the goalkeeper with the most assists in Premier League history. The Italian, while being a master in the art of shot stopping, is not at the level of Ederson when it comes to using his feet. This transition points to Pep Guardiola's plan to rely more on a traditional keeper rather that the ball-playing keeper and build-from-the-back system seen for the past several years at the club.Donnarumma rose through AC Milan’s academy and made his senior debut at just 16, eventually recording 250 appearances for the club and helping them to the 2016 Italian Supercoppa. In 2021, he joined PSG, where he spent four seasons and was central to their domestic dominance. He lifted four Ligue 1 titles, two Coupe de France trophies, three Trophee des Champions crowns, and most recently, the club’s first UEFA Champions League trophy.Internationally, Donnarumma was Italy’s standout performer at Euro 2020, starring in the penalty shootout victory against England at Wembley. His performances earned him the Player of the Tournament award.Speaking on his move, Donnarumma said, ""To have signed for Manchester City is such a special and proud moment for me. I am joining a squad packed with world-class talent and a team led by the one of the greatest managers in the history of football in Pep Guardiola. This is a club every player in world football would love to join.""He added, ""I have admired watching Manchester City for many years - so to now be able to play for the club is a huge honour and a privilege. I cannot wait to meet my new teammates, the staff and the fans. Playing at the Etihad Stadium will be very, very special for me. I am very excited for what lies ahead and can promise that I will give absolutely everything to try and help the club achieve even more success.""City’s Director of Football Hugo Viana described the arrival as a major boost. ""Gianluigi's pedigree, quality and record speaks for itself, and we are all absolutely thrilled he has joined us here at City,"" Viana said. ""There is no doubt Gianluigi will bring further quality and depth to our top-class goalkeeping department.""","Gianluigi Donnarumma joins Manchester City from Paris Saint-Germain.

The Premier League ’s record-breaking summer transfer window, surpassing three billion euros, has sent shockwaves through German football. Four of the most expensive Premier League signings in September 2025 came from the Bundesliga, impacting clubs including Bayern Munich and sparking debates about the future of German football, including discussions around the fan-favoured 50+1 rule that limits outside investment.Premier League clubs acquired Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, Nick Woltemade, and Benjamin Sesko from Bundesliga teams, spending over 380 million euros, including bonuses, on these four players alone. Liverpool secured two of these high-profile transfers.Bayern Munich CEO Oliver Kahn criticised German football administrators for their approach to competing with the Premier League. “For many, this is normal now. For me, it’s a signal. The league is playing too safe and has forgotten how to take risks,” Kahn wrote on LinkedIn. “The question is whether we want to remain a league that creates talent and loses it or create conditions for talents to stay here.”The 50+1 rule requires German clubs to maintain majority ownership by club members, primarily fans, restricting external investment. Only Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg have exceptions, both of which have won league titles in the past two decades.Leverkusen, champions of the 2023-24 double, lost eight players this summer, with five joining Premier League clubs. Sporting director Simon Rolfes said, “When a domino falls in England, it will fall here. As a club, you have almost no choice but to let the player go.”Several Bundesliga clubs, including Borussia Dortmund, Leverkusen, RB Leipzig, and Stuttgart, each sold at least one player to the Premier League for over 50 million euros. Rolfes added that developing youth academy programs could help offset the Premier League’s financial advantage.Stuttgart benefited from Porsche’s 100 million euro investment for a minority stake in 2024, which helped the club qualify for the Champions League and win the German Cup. They later sold Woltemade for 85 million euros, just one season after signing him on a free transfer.Even Bayern Munich felt the financial strain, missing out on signing Wirtz and Woltemade. Sporting director Max Eberl admitted, “Certain things weren’t possible during the transfer window because we want to be very financially prudent.” Bayern coach Vincent Kompany summed up the league’s appeal in one word: “Money.”Bayern’s historical dominance in German football, built on acquiring top talent from domestic rivals, is now being challenged. Maintaining their traditional strategy of recruiting the best players from Bundesliga clubs has become increasingly difficult in the face of the Premier League’s financial power.","Four of the most expensive Premier League signings in September 2025 came from the Bundesliga.

Poll Do you think Erik Ten Hag deserved more time at Bayer Leverkusen? Yes, he needed more time to build the team No, the results were unacceptable It was too early to judge

Erik Ten Hag’s stint as Bayer Leverkusen manager has come to an abrupt end, with the Bundesliga champions dismissing him after just two league games in charge. The Dutchman, who succeeded Xabi Alonso following his move to Real Madrid, departs less than two months into the job.“This decision was not easy for us. Nobody wanted to take this step,” sporting director Simon Rolfes said in a statement. He added, “The past few weeks have shown that the steps to build a new and successful team have not been effective.”Club CEO Fernando Carro admitted the move was tough but unavoidable. “The decision was painful, but necessary,” he said, as quoted by AFP.The dismissal makes Ten Hag, 55, the coach to be fired the earliest in a Bundesliga season, surpassing the previous mark of five matches.Ten Hag, appointed on July 1, oversaw just three games in total. After a routine 4-0 German Cup win over Sonnenhof Grossaspach, Leverkusen struggled in the league. They lost 2-1 at home to Hoffenheim after leading early and then squandered a two-goal cushion against ten-man Werder Bremen to draw 3-3. His first outing, a friendly against Flamengo’s under-20 side in Brazil, had ended in a 5-1 defeat.Leverkusen had entered the season amid major upheaval, with several key players from last year’s double-winning squad departing, including Florian Wirtz, Granit Xhaka and Jonathan Tah.The club invested heavily in replacements, with summer signings Malik Tilmann, Jarell Quansah and Eliesse Ben Seghir arriving for over €100 million combined.Despite the backing, results failed to materialize, prompting Leverkusen to act swiftly. The club confirmed that training will be handled by assistant coaches until a permanent successor is announced.For Ten Hag, the setback comes less than a year after being dismissed by Manchester United in October 2024, despite winning both the FA Cup and League Cup during his tenure.",Bayer Leverkusen sack Erik Ten Hag after just two league games in charge.

Poll Should there be penalties for players involved in post-match altercations? Yes, but only for extreme actions No, it's part of the heat of the moment

The Leagues Cup final between Seattle Sounders and Inter Miami ended in ugly scenes on Sunday, with Luis Suárez appearing to spit at an opposition staff member during post-match confrontations.Moments after Seattle’s 3-0 victory at Lumen Field, the Uruguayan striker confronted 20-year-old midfielder Obed Vargas and locked him in a headlock, sparking a scuffle that quickly escalated to involve players and staff from both teams. Match officials moved in to break up the fracas, but broadcast cameras appeared to capture Suárez spitting in the direction of a Seattle staff member as tensions boiled over.Inter Miami head coach Javier Mascherano admitted he could not comment directly, saying he was too far away to witness events in detail. “Nobody likes these kinds of actions at the end of a match, but if there’s a reaction, maybe there was provocation,” he told reporters.The trophy ceremony was delayed as tempers simmered, though both sides eventually came together on the pitch. Seattle head coach Brian Schmetzer, however, chose to steer the focus back to his side’s performance. “Unfortunately that is going to take some of the attention away from a great performance by the Seattle Sounders,” he said, as quoted by AFP.He added: “I guess we can take that as a compliment that Miami’s frustrations led to some things happening on the field that shouldn’t happen on the field. I’m going to shut that down because that shouldn’t be the story.”Schmetzer also revealed he shared a quiet exchange with Lionel Messi after the match, saying it was a respectful moment amid the chaos.Despite that, Suárez, 38, is likely to face further scrutiny, with the incident adding to an already controversial career marked by several high-profile disciplinary cases. There is yet to be any official statement on the incident from either side or if any penalty will fall upon the Uruguayan.",Seattle Sounders beat Inter Miami 3-0 in the Leagues Cup final on Sunday.

Poll Did Messi's miss cost Inter Miami the Leagues Cup? Yes No, it was a team loss

The Seattle Sounders delivered a commanding performance to defeat Lionel Messi ’s Inter Miami 3-0 in the Leagues Cup final on Sunday, completing their sweep of major North American trophies before a record crowd at Lumen Field.Osaze De Rosario opened the scoring in the 26th minute with a header from an Alex Roldan cross, sending the 69,314 fans into pandemonium. Roldan himself converted a penalty late in the second half, before Paul Rothrock sealed the victory in the 89th minute to spark celebrations.Seattle’s disciplined back line frustrated Miami’s star-studded attack throughout the contest. Messi saw an early header denied by Jackson Ragen, while another effort sailed over the bar after Luis Suárez created space for him early in the second half. The miss from close range shocked many given the fact that the Argentine is one of the deadliest finishers in the game from near. Miami’s best chance came in the 60th minute when Tadeo Allende missed wide from close range.Despite Miami’s pressure, the Sounders held firm. Ragen, Vargas and García combined to block repeated attempts, while goalkeeper Oscar Ustari was called into action on several occasions to deny further damage.The game reached a flashpoint when Yannik Bright’s challenge on substitute Georgi Minoungou earned Seattle a penalty in the 84th minute. Roldan calmly converted to double the advantage. Moments later, Rothrock’s angled finish completed the upset.The result extended Seattle’s trophy cabinet to include every major title available to an MLS club: two MLS Cups, a Supporters’ Shield, four US Open Cups, a CONCACAF Champions Cup and now the Leagues Cup. Their triumph came despite Miami boasting nearly triple the player wage bill, with the Sounders’ $16.7 million payroll dwarfed by Miami’s $46.8m.It was also a night of records in the stands, as the attendance figure set a new high for a Leagues Cup match and a new mark for any Sounders fixture at Lumen Field.The victory not only secured Seattle the Leagues Cup but also guaranteed direct entry into the round of 16 of the 2026 CONCACAF Champions Cup. Both finalists had already earned qualification for that competition, which will serve as the pathway to the 2029 FIFA Club World Cup.More surprisingly, it was the timing of Inter Miami's final defeat, which came just a week following Cristiano Ronaldo and Al-Nassr's loss on penalties to Al-Ahli in the Saudi Super Cup final.","Seattle Sounders beat Inter Miami 3-0 in the Leagues Cup final on Sunday.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

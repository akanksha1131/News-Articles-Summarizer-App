Former Australia captain Steve Waugh calls Virat Kohli the ODI GOAT

NEW DELHI: Pakistan cricketer Azam Khan has drawn a comparison between Babar Azam ’s impact on Pakistan cricket and Virat Kohli ’s influence on Indian cricket, highlighting how Babar transformed Pakistan’s image from a team known mainly for its fast bowlers to one celebrated for batting excellence — despite not having the same level of support that Kohli enjoyed during his rise.Speaking on the Crickwick podcast, Azam Khan praised Babar for changing the narrative around Pakistan cricket.""Pakistan cricket was famous because of fast bowling. But this guy made it famous because of his batting. There is a huge difference. Like what Virat Kohli did for India,"" Azam said.He went on to point out the contrasting environments in which the two batters developed.""Virat Kohli had someone around him who was a legend at that time. In the era he started playing in, he had VVS Laxman, Sachin Tendulkar , Rahul Dravid , Virender Sehwag, and MS Dhoni. So many big batters. But who was there with Babar? There was no one,"" Azam added.Former Pakistan batter Mohsin Khan also weighed in on the discussion, acknowledging Babar’s batting brilliance but stressing the need for stronger support around him.""Babar isn't a bad batter,"" Mohsin said. ""But you need a clutch of quality players around him to support him. Look at Virat Kohli — in Tests, he had Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, and KL Rahul. In ODIs, he had Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan. A great player is made even greater when surrounded by other strong players.""Mohsin further expressed concern over the heavy burden placed on Babar and Mohammad Rizwan to deliver consistently.""If you are always put under pressure that you have to score centuries every time you step out, they are humans too — hence at times you aren't able to play the game the team requires you to play,"" he said.Reflecting on Pakistan’s rich batting history, Mohsin added, ""During our time, there was Majid Khan, Javed Miandad, Zaheer Abbas, and later Saeed Anwar, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Mohammad Yousuf, and Younis Khan. Teams are built on numbers — you need a group of players who are more or less of the same quality. Right now, there is a big gulf between Babar and the rest.""",Pakistan cricketer Azam Khan has drawn a comparison between Babar Azam ’s impact on Pakistan cricket and Virat Kohli’s influence on Indian cricket.

Suryakumar Yadav and Abhishek Sharma press conference: On touching a trophy, Women's World Cup, more

NEW DELHI: Indian T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav made a subtle reference to the ongoing Asia Cup trophy controversy while celebrating India’s 2-1 series win over Australia, after the fifth and final T20I in Brisbane was washed out. The controversy arose when India refused to accept the Asia Cup trophy from Pakistan Cricket Board chief Mohsin Naqvi following their victory in the final on September 28.During the post-match press conference in Brisbane, Suryakumar expressed his happiness at finally getting to hold a trophy.""It feels great to finally get to touch the trophy. Felt it in my hands, when I was handed over the trophy for the series victory. A few days back another trophy arrived in India our women's team has won the World Cup. That trophy has also arrived back home. It feels great and getting to touching this trophy as well feels good,"" he stated.The Indian team had earlier declined to receive the Asia Cup winner’s trophy from PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi, who also serves as the Asian Cricket Council chairperson, citing his anti-India stance.Efforts are now underway to resolve the trophy dispute, with representatives from both cricket boards having met recently in Dubai. BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia met PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi during an ICC gathering to discuss the issue.""I was a part of both the informal and formal meeting of the ICC.

Suryakumar Yadav and Abhishek Sharma press conference: On touching a trophy, Women's World Cup, more

NEW DELHI: Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav hailed Jasprit Bumrah ’s impact on the team after India sealed a 2-1 T20I series win over Australia, highlighting the senior pacer’s experience, mentorship, and influence on the dressing room atmosphere.Yadav said Bumrah’s presence had instilled a sense of accountability among the bowlers while also creating a strong bond within the group.“From a bowling point of view as well, people are taking responsibility. Having an experienced bowler like [Jasprit] Bumrah around in the team and everyone chatting with him, learning a lot of skills, tricks and trade of the game, I think that's a good thing. So there's good friendship building up in that as well,” Suryakumar told reporters after the series win.The victory marked India’s seventh straight T20I series triumph since their 2024 T20 World Cup win, underlining their continued dominance in the shortest format. The fifth and final T20I at The Gabba in Brisbane on Saturday was washed out due to persistent rain and lightning, leaving India 52 for no loss in 4.5 overs before play was abandoned.India’s openers Abhishek Sharma (23)* and Shubman Gill (29)* had given the visitors a flying start, adding 50 runs inside the Powerplay before the weather intervened.Across the series, Suryakumar praised both departments, appreciating the bowlers’ adaptability and the consistency shown by the top-order batters.“From a batting point of view, definitely what we've been doing in the last six to eight months, I think we're sticking to that, not changing anything. These guys are doing it really well. The way they bat at the top of the order puts a smile on everyone's face when they're batting together,” he said.“So we are trying to get there. There's never anything like all bases covered. We always learn from this game, every game we play. Yeah, till now things look good, touch wood, let's continue that,” he added.Bumrah, who now has 99 wickets in 79 T20Is at an average of 18.11 and an economy of 6.36, is India’s second-highest wicket-taker in the format, behind Arshdeep Singh (105 wickets in 67 matches).Australia had earlier won the second T20I after the series opener was rained out, but India bounced back to clinch victories in Hobart and the Gold Coast before sealing the series with the washed-out finale.",India captain Suryakumar Yadav hails Jasprit Bumrah's impact on the team.

Cheteshwar Pujara retires: India’s ROCK calls it a day! Relive epic quotes by Rohit, Ashwin

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders co-owner Shah Rukh Khan extended remarkable support to cricketer Cheteshwar Pujara during his serious knee injury in 2010, arranging for his surgery in Cape Town after the batter tore his anterior cruciate ligament before even playing a single match for the IPL franchise.The injury occurred during a practice session when Pujara injured himself while attempting a catch, resulting in a ruptured ACL that temporarily derailed his budding career.Pujara’s wife, Puja, recalled the incident in her book The Diary of a Cricketer’s Wife: “Destiny impelled him to dash heedlessly to a ball for a catch that was never there; and the result: a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament, an impending surgery and a temporarily halted cricketing career — all without playing a single game for KKR.”The KKR franchise took full responsibility for his treatment, managing every detail — from medical coordination to passports, visas, and travel. They even arranged for Pujara’s father to accompany him to South Africa.In the book, Pujara’s father recounted Shah Rukh Khan’s generous gesture: “Shah Rukh also told me that Chintu had a great future ahead of him and should have the best available medical treatment. When he realised I was worried about the absence of a support system in South Africa and my faith in Dr Shah’s abilities, he offered to fly him and any family members I wanted with me.”A team representative also assured complete support, saying: “We’ll also fly down anyone you want for the surgery. We’ll pay them here so that you have your own people around you.”The timing of the injury was especially difficult for Pujara, who was then making waves with strong domestic performances. Fortunately, the surgery was successful, enabling him to make a full recovery and resume his cricket career.","Kolkata Knight Riders co-owner Shah Rukh Khan extended remarkable support to cricketer Cheteshwar Pujara during his serious knee injury in 2010.

Inside details of how PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi ran away with the Asia Cup trophy!

All eyes were on the ICC Board meet in Dubai on Friday as the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) secretary Devajit Saikia was expected to raise the Asia Cup trophy matter. The issue, however, was neither raised at the Chief Executives Committee (CEC) meet earlier this week nor at the Board meet. It wasn't part of any official agenda and never came up for a formal discussion during the last few days in Dubai.It is learnt that there were some informal discussions on the sidelines of the Board meet where Saikia pointed out that India, the winners of 2025 Asia Cup, are yet to get the trophy. While Saikia was representing the Indian cricket board, Mohsin Naqvi represented the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).There was a lot of suspense around Naqvi's attendance for the meet but, as TimesofIndia.com had reported earlier , the PCB chief reached Dubai just an hour before the formal Board meet was to get underway. It is further understood that the Board members had lengthy informal discussions before the official session but Naqvi skipped that as he left for Dubai only on Friday morning. He was scheduled to stay in Dubai overnight and the feeling in the room was that the trophy impasse could end soon.""There were no heated arguments or anything. The matter was brought up during an informal discussion and both PCB and BCCI would work towards resolving it at the earliest.Whether it needs intervention from ICC - by forming a committee or something - is not decided at this stage, but it was all very healthy and cordial,"" says an administrator who attended the meetings in Dubai this week.""Yes there were serious doubts whether Mr Mohsin Naqvi would come for the Board meet but once he came, routine followed and the trophy matter was only discussed on the sidelines,"" he added.TimesofIndia.com reached out to BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia for a comment and the story will be updated the moment he responds.",Mohsin Naqvi reached Dubai just an hour before the formal Board meet was to get underway.

Manjurul denies allegations as 'baseless'

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced on Thursday that it will establish a committee to investigate allegations made by fast bowler Jahanara Alam regarding inappropriate behaviour by a former selector during the 2022 ODI World Cup. The board has given the committee 15 working days to submit its findings and recommendations, demonstrating its commitment to addressing the serious nature of these allegations.Jahanara Alam, who currently resides in Australia, revealed in an interview with journalist Riasad Azim that a former selector, who served as both selector and manager of the women's team, behaved inappropriately towards her. She specifically mentioned that the individual asked her lewd questions during their interactions.""I faced several times (indecent proposal), not once. Definitely, when we are involved with the team, we cannot speak out about many things, even if we want to. When it comes to your bread and butter, when you are known by a few people, you cannot say or protest many things even if you want to,"" Jahanara told Azim's YouTube channel.The fast bowler, who has represented Bangladesh in 135 matches, also alleged that multiple BCB officials acted inappropriately with her.She stated that she had reported these incidents to former BCB director Shafiul Islam Nadel and the board's chief executive Nizamuddin Chowdhury.""In 2021, Towhid Bhai approached me through Babu Bhai (Coordinator Sarfaraz Babu). I've said this many times before. I don't know why they misbehaved with me. I tried hard to stay quiet and focus on cricket. But when I tactfully avoided the proposal, Manju Bhai began humiliating and insulting me from the very next day,"" Jahanara said in the video.""Towhid Bhai never spoke to me directly - he sent Babu Bhai instead. After about a year and a half, I submitted an 'Observation Letter' to the CEO, not a complaint, explaining everything. Babu Bhai had told me to 'look after Towhid Sir,' but I replied, 'He's the in-charge, what is there for me to look after?' I deliberately pretended not to understand the proposal. I'm sharing this so that other girls can also protect themselves this way. That's when Manju Bhai's bad behaviour started.""""The second proposal came from Manju Bhai during the 2022 World Cup. I decided to inform the BCB about everything that had happened over the past year and a half. I told Nadel Sir several times - he'd offer a temporary fix, but soon things went back to the same. I even informed the CEO.""Jahanara revealed that Manjurul had the tendency of getting too close to female players. Many of them started avoiding him because of this habit.""During our pre-camp, while I was bowling, he came up and placed his hand on my shoulder. He had a habit of pulling girls close, pressing them to his chest, and talking near their ears. We used to avoid him - even during handshakes after matches, we would extend our hands from a distance so he couldn't pull us in. Among ourselves, we'd joke nervously, 'He's coming, he'll hug us again.'""Narrating an incident, Jahanara said that the former selector came too close and asked about her period cycle.""Once he came near me, held my hand, put his arm on my shoulder, leaned close to my ear, and asked, 'How many days has your period been?' He already knew, since physios track players' cycles for health reasons as per ICC guidelines. I don't know why a manager or selector needed that information. When I said, 'Five days,' he replied, 'Five days? It should've ended yesterday. When your period is over, tell me - I have to look after my side too. ' I just looked at him and said, 'Sorry, Bhaiya, I didn't understand.'""Manjurul has categorically denied these allegations, calling them 'baseless'. ""What can I say apart from terming it as baseless. You can ask other cricketers whether I was good or bad"" Manjurul told Cricbuzz.""It's unfortunate she is dragging a dead man. I just want her to come up with proof instead of making baseless accusations,"" said Babu.""The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has noted with concern the allegations reported in the media made by a former member of the Bangladesh national women's cricket team regarding alleged misconduct by certain individuals associated with the team,"" the BCB stated in their official release.""As the matter is of a sensitive nature, the BCB has decided to form a committee to investigate the allegations thoroughly. The committee will submit its findings and recommendations within 15 working days. The BCB is committed to ensuring a safe, respectful, and professional environment for all its players and personnel. The board takes such matters with utmost seriousness and will take appropriate action based on the findings of the investigation. ""These recent allegations follow Jahanara's previous claims where she accused Bangladesh captain Nigar Sultana of physically abusing her teammates. The BCB had dismissed these earlier allegations as ""baseless.""Jahanara Alam has established herself as a significant player in Bangladesh women's cricket, taking 48 wickets in ODIs and 60 wickets in T20Is throughout her career. Her achievements extend beyond national cricket, as she holds the distinction of being the only Bangladesh player to have participated in both the Women's T20 Challenge in India and the FairBreak Invitational T20.","Jahanara Alam has alleged abuse by ex-Bangladesh selector during the 2022 World Cup.

Former Australia captain Steve Waugh calls Virat Kohli the ODI GOAT

Poll Do you think Virat Kohli's calmness has positively impacted his performance? Yes, absolutely No, his aggressiveness is what sets him apart

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif believes Virat Kohli has become a calmer and more composed cricketer in recent years, crediting his maturity and understanding of the game for the change.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Kaif said he had noticed a clear difference in Kohli ’s approach compared to his early playing days. “Virat Kohli has become a bit calm now. There is a lot of difference between how he was before marriage and how he is after marriage,” Kaif said.Recalling a chat with Kohli during an IPL match, Kaif added that the star batter’s decision-making has evolved. “When I see him playing now… he hit (Kagiso) Rabada for a boundary coming down the ground, maybe he had scored a half-century and won the game. But he was very calm. He told me that if I had not attacked Rabada early on, he would not have let me play. So I wanted to hit him off the first ball,” Kaif said, adding that Kohli’s “understanding of cricket has improved with calmness. ”Kaif, who shared the dressing room with Kohli at Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), said the 37-year-old’s attitude towards people remains unchanged despite his superstar status.“He still wants to improve his game after having played for so many years.And he still meets me the same way even now. If he called you a brother before, he will call you a brother now as well. When you meet him off the field, he will remember that he has played with you and will give you that respect. There is no change there,” Kaif said.Kohli recently featured in the ODI series against Australia, bouncing back with an unbeaten 74 in the final game after consecutive ducks in the first two matches.Addressing speculation about Kohli’s contract situation with RCB, Kaif said the batter was taking a cautious approach amid ownership changes. “There are rumours that the next season might not have the RCB name. Virat Kohli did not sign the commercial contract as he was waiting to see what direction the new owners would take,” he said.",Mohammad Kaif believes Virat Kohli has become a calmer cricketer in recent years.

India's Women's World Cup-winning head coach Amol Muzumdar revealed that his ""seven hours without noise"" speech to the team huddle was unplanned. The speech gained attention and drew parallels to actor Shah Rukh Khan's ""Sattar minute"" speech from the movie 'Chak de India'.During his pre-match talk, Muzumdar delivered an inspiring message to the team.""Seven hours we cut out all the noise. We cut them out of our lives; we create our own bubble here. Seven hours create our own bubble, and we step into it, and we finish that, and we write our own story, no more stories from the outside. We write our own story. You will write your own story. Let's stay in that bubble for the next seven hours. Let's create history,"" he said.Muzumdar emphasised that his speech was genuine and not theatrical. He shared that while he prepared his huddle talks until the semifinals, the final speech emerged naturally.""I am not about dramatics. So I am far away from that. What comes out is very honest, and I speak from my heart. I do not know where the parallels (with SRK's Chak de India speech) have come from. However, I have seen that I use my phone. So I see those things, you know, coming through,"" he noted.The coach further explained his approach to team talks, saying, ""Look, if there are parallels, there are parallels. I cannot help it. Yes, regarding the motivational speeches, until the semifinal one, I always knew what I was going to say in the huddle. I always knew that I would speak this to the players so that they get charged up, so that they set the tone right, right at the start of the huddle. And that's where everything, the energy flows from the huddle. I always knew it.""He described how the final speech came to him, adding: ""But in the finals, about that seven hours thing, it was an absolute impromptu one. I didn't know what I was going to speak about, and that time I just tapped on my own shoulder and said, I'm going to speak about what you feel like over there. And went into the huddle and that thing came up.""Muzumdar identified the match against New Zealand as his most cherished moment of the tournament. After three consecutive losses, India faced a crucial situation.""The day we turned up for the New Zealand game, it was a do-or-die situation. You win the game, and you advance to the semifinals. You lose the game, you're out of the World Cup. And there will be some brick bats after that. So it was on the knife's edge,"" he added.He recalled the partnership that turned the game around: ""And when we entered the ground and when the partnership started to happen, blossom between Pratika and Smriti Mandana, that is a time when I felt we were in control of this. And I will remember that particular day, that particular game against New Zealand, as one of the most cherished one in this tournament.""The coach shared his thoughts on the World Cup victory and future aspirations: ""It was always a dream to, you know, to win the World Cup or to become the best in the world. And it still is a dream. You know, that dream cannot just end with the World Cup. It has to continue. That journey has to continue. There was one dream of winning the 50-over World Cup. There it is. But at the same time, the journey continues.""In the final match against South Africa, India posted 298/7 with Shafali Verma scoring 87 and Deepti Sharma contributing 58.

Poll What was the key factor in Pakistan's win against South Africa? Abrar Ahmed's bowling performance Strong opening partnership Teamwork and collaboration Inexperienced South African batters

NEW DELHI: Leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed ’s magical spell of 4-27 dismantled a fragile South African batting lineup as Pakistan clinched the three-match ODI series 2-1 with a dominant seven-wicket win in the final game at Faisalabad on Saturday.Bowling first after South Africa finally won their first toss of the tour, Pakistan bundled out the visitors for just 143 in 37.5 overs, as the Proteas lost their last eight wickets for a mere 37 runs. Abrar’s career-best figures came on a slow surface where his variations completely flummoxed South Africa’s inexperienced batters.Openers Quinton de Kock (53) and Lhuan-dre Pretorius (39) had given South Africa another strong start of 72 runs, but once Pretorius was caught at long-on off Salman Ali Agha, the innings collapsed dramatically. De Kock, who became the second-fastest South African to reach 7,000 ODI runs after Hashim Amla, was soon trapped lbw by Mohammad Nawaz while attempting a slog sweep — a dismissal that opened the floodgates.Abrar ran through the middle order in a mesmerising two-over burst — bowling debutant Rubin Hermann with a googly, then cleaning up Donovan Ferreira and Corbin Bosch with sharp turn and low bounce. Nawaz chipped in with 2-31, while Shaheen Shah Afridi polished off the tail with two wickets in two balls.“We were probably looking at 250,” South Africa captain Matthew Breetzke admitted. “It was tough conditions and unfortunately we lost too many wickets there … Abrar bowled really nicely.”In reply, Pakistan cruised to 144/3 in 25.1 overs, led by a blazing 77 off 70 balls from Saim Ayub, who struck 11 fours and a six. After Fakhar Zaman fell for a duck, Ayub and Babar Azam (27) steadied the chase with a fluent 65-run stand before Mohammad Rizwan (32) finished the job with ease.Captain Shaheen Afridi, leading Pakistan to victory in his debut ODI series as skipper, lauded his team’s collective effort: “It’s been teamwork across formats. The spinners turned the game around, and everyone took their chances.”With this win, Pakistan capped a successful home season — drawing the Tests 1-1 and clinching both the T20I and ODI series against South Africa.",Pakistan beat South Africa by seven wickets in final ODI in Faisalabad.

MUMBAI: Saturday morning began on a tough note for Musheer Khan. As he was preparing to leave for the MCA ground in BKC to take part in Mumbai's Ranji Trophy match against Himachal, the 20-year-old allrounder learnt that he had lost his 'mamu,' maternal uncle, with whom he developed a great affinity while growing up.It's the sort of time when you can be drowned in memories and emotions. However, the youngster did well to put up a brave show, pulling Mumbai out of the woods as they slipped to 35 for three and then 73 for four, slamming fourth First-class century (112 off 162 balls with 14 fours), and his first since Sept last year, after which he suffered a horrific accident was ruled out of the 2024-25 domestic season.However, once he reached his milestone, which took 143 balls and saw him occupy the crease for a mammoth 263 minutes, Musheer let his emotions out, breaking into tears as he raised his bat towards the dressing room and the spectators in the BKC Clubhouse.“Firstly, this century came after a long time, and also I felt so emotional after losing my mamu (maternal uncle), with whom I have so many fond memories. I have played in his lap,” Musheer said.Usually, whenever Musheer or his elder brother Sarfaraz Khan play in a match in Mumbai, their father-cum-coach Naushad Khan makes it a point to watch the boys in action. However, on Saturday, he had to rush to Azamgarh to be with the grieving family. Overcoming a tough situation, Musheer managed to pay tribute to his maternal uncle with a classy ton.There's a special connection that the young turk has with the MCA ground in BKC. He made his first-class debut for Mumbai against Saurashtra here in Dec 2022. In the next Ranji season (2024-25), Musheer, staging a magnificent comeback into the Mumbai team in the Ranji Trophy knockouts, slammed 203* & 55 against Baroda in the quarterfinal, and then 55 against Tamil nadu in the semifinal, besides taking two for 18 with his left-arm spin.Possessing an unconventional method of charging down to the pacers repeatedly, Musheer knows that there are runs to be plundered at BKC once the early morning moisture dries up. ""In this venue, the morning session always produces two or three wickets. So, we were clear that we did not want to go after runs, just wanted to play well in that session. The BKC is my favourite ground, I have played here since childhood and scored a lot of runs, so I knew the wicket will get easier to bat after lunch,” he said.Displaying oodles of patience during his 157-run partnership with fellow centurion Siddhesh Lad (100 not out off 207 balls), Musheer chose to grind the Himachal bowlers out on a hot day at a venue where he has mastered the art of scoring runs. “I always think that I am starting from zero at the start of every session. So, I try to bat long, try to bat lots of balls. Here, there are two phases. One is in the morning. In the evening as well, with the shade coming off the buildings, sighting gets a bit difficult, especially if the bowler gets some assistance. Once you are set, past your hundred, seeing the ball like a football, then you see the shade, you tell yourself to restart again. So, that’s the mindset I had for morning and evening. I try to play every ball like it is the first ball,” he said.Explaining his unconventional method of frequently charging down the track to even the fast bowlers, Musheer said, “Because if the bowler gets a rhythm, he becomes better. With the new ball too, I try to not overdo it, but once in a over, I try to disturb the length.”""We are very happy (that) Musheer is back in form. We know he has got the potential to score big runs,"" Lad had said on Friday, after Musheer, playing the role of an opener, shrugged off his lean start to the season (0 & 8 vs Jammu & Kashmir) & 12 (vs Chhatisgarh), with scores of 49 & 63 against Rajasthan at Jaipur. Clearly, the Mumbai team is aware of what Musheer can produce once he finds his mojo, as he did on Saturday against Himachal. “First of all, I would like to thank the coaches and the captain, Shardul bhai (Shardul Thakur). He backed me a lot, because in the initial matches, I didn't get a lot of runs.And I would like to thank the Mumbai Cricket Association and the BCCI's CoE, where I underwent rehab, as well,"" he said.Closing in on 1,000 first-class runs-he has got to 960 in his 13th match-Musheer, who scored a match-winning century in the Ranji Trophy, knows the importance of this century, which has come after being on the sidelined due to his neck injury caused by the accident.""I always follow the process. This hundred is important because it gives you confidence early in the season. I came close in the last match but could not because of a lapse in concentration,” he said.Even as Musheer savoured his century, his elder brother Sarfaraz’s poor form continued, as the seasoned campaigner was dismissed for a 57-ball 16. Before he left for the dressing room, Sarfaraz offered a valuable piece of advice for Musheer. “Bhai told me to stay there and keep scoring…” he said.Elaborating on the symphony with Lad, which left the Himachalk bowlers huffing and puffing, Musheer said, ""I like it that our seniors are letting us play our own game. They don't tell us how we have to play, but just tell us to look at the team and the situation. They have given us a free hand. 'They have told us: 'You can hit a six or you can play your own game. But the team comes first.’ We (I and Lad) had thought that unless the bowler bowls an unplayable delivery, we won't throw our wicket. ”","Musheer Khan hits fourth First-class century (112 off 162 balls with 14 fours), and his first since Sept last year, after which he suffered a horrific accident. The 20-year-old allrounder learnt that he had lost his'mamu,' maternal uncle, with whom he developed a great affinity while growing up.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125187532,imgsize-18982,width-400,resizemode-4/musheer-khan.jpg"

Poll Should fast bowlers focus more on pace or technique? Pace is more important Technique is more important Both are equally important

NEW DELHI: Auqib Nabi is 29 years old. Coming from the valleys of Baramulla in Jammu and Kashmir, it has taken quite some time for him to truly understand the art of seam bowling. This season is about him applying everything that he has learned in his journey from playing with the tennis ball till 17 to now becoming the most consistent seam bowler in the domestic circuit.On a nippy Saturday at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, Nabi flaunted his recently-developed skills with the old ball to claim the third fiver of the season to dismiss Delhi for a modest 211 on the first day of their Ranji Trophy . The mild pre-winter chill in the air was bound to assist the J&K seamers. He removed opener Arpit Rana with the new ball before coming back later in the day to polish off Delhi’s lower-middle-order with an exquisite display of reverse swing to return figures of 5/35. He isn’t the sharpest seamer going around but he can cut through batting lineups with ease.Delhi captain Ayush Badoni looked a class apart before left-arm spinner trapped him in front for a fluent 64 off 82. In-form Ayush Doseja looked good for 65 with allrounder Sumit Mathur being the only other batter to show some resistance with an unbeaten 55. That gave Delhi just about enough to stay in the game with pacer Simarjeet Singh picking up three wickets in the last session to reduce J&K to 31/3.The day belonged to the unassuming Nabi. “I’ve worked on my mindset. No matter what the wicket or the conditions are, you have to bowl on the same pitch. I've gradually developed the in-swing,” Nabi said after the day’s play.“I developed the inswing myself . I worked hard on it and did separate drills. After the season, the JKCA camp starts again, and we have coaches with whom we constantly discuss what new things we can do,” he added.He is particularly proud of the reverse swing he is getting with the old ball. Nabi has spent several hours watching the videos of Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami and Mohammed Siraj to develop his skills in these conditions. “No one is better than these bowlers on Indian wickets because fast bowlers don't get much help in India. So, I learn by watching them. I watch their videos to learn how to bowl on flat wickets.” he said.Nabi has seen Umran Malik’s rapid rise from close quarters. Yet, he has resisted pushing himself into bowling fast like Malik. He claims he has realised his strengths and limitations. The extra pace could catapult him to IPL and India contention quicker. He has now learnt to block out the noise. “I don't think too much about speed. You just give your best with the things you have. For example, I have some things (in-swing) that not many people have. So, I don't think that it would be good if I could get that (pace) too. I don't look at the speedometer. Earlier I used to think too much about taking wickets. But now I think about bowling in good areas,” claimed Nabi.He has laid the foundation for J&K to move ahead rapidly in this Ranji Trophy campaign. It’s about finishing the job in the second innings here.",Jammu & Kashmir seamer Auqib Nabi took five wickets on the first day of their Ranji Trophy match against Delhi. Nabi removed opener Arpit Rana with the new ball before coming back later in the day to polish off Delhi’s lower-middle- order with an exquisite display of reverse swing to return figures of 5/35.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125187066,imgsize-19096,width-400,resizemode-4/auqib-nabi.jpg"

Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) have earned a reputation as a preferred franchise in the IPL , known for both their successful history and exceptional player treatment. Many players, including Rinku Singh, remain loyal to the team due to their supportive approach during difficult times.A previously unknown story has emerged about Cheteshwar Pujara 's connection with KKR. In 2009, at age 21, Pujara joined KKR following an impressive domestic season. During a practice match, he suffered a severe anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear in his knee, an injury that typically requires up to a year for recovery and has ended many athletic careers.""Destiny impelled him to dash heedlessly to a ball for a catch that was never there; and the result: a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament, an impending surgery and a temporarily halted cricketing career — all without playing a single game for KKR,"" wrote Puja Pujara, Cheteshwar's wife, in The Diary of a Cricketer's Wife.KKR took immediate action to help Pujara, arranging for his surgery in Cape Town, where specialised sports injury treatment was available. Initially, Pujara's father preferred the surgery to be done in Rajkot, their hometown, but Shah Rukh Khan personally intervened to convince him about the superior medical care in South Africa.The franchise managed all logistics, including passports, visas, and travel arrangements. They also arranged for Pujara's father and family doctor to accompany him.""Shah Rukh also told me that Chintu had a great future ahead of him and should have the best available medical treatment. When he realised I was worried about the absence of a support system in South Africa and my faith in Dr Shah's abilities, he offered to fly him and any family members I wanted with me,"" Pujara's father stated in the book.""We'll also fly down anyone you want for the surgery. We'll pay them here so that you have your own people around you,"" a KKR representative told Pujara's family, as mentioned in the book.The surgery proved successful, allowing Pujara to make a complete recovery. He went on to become a crucial Test batsman for India before his recent retirement.","Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) have earned a reputation as a preferred franchise in the IPL.

Suryakumar Yadav and Abhishek Sharma press conference: On touching a trophy, Women's World Cup, more

Poll Are Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill a good batting pair? Yes, they complement each other well. No, they should change partners. They need more time together.

NEW DELHI: India captain Suryakumar Yadav has come out strongly in support of Shubman Gill , backing the opener’s approach and partnership with Abhishek Sharma , after India sealed a 2-1 T20I series win over Australia.Ever since Gill returned to India’s T20I setup for the Asia Cup 2025, questions have persisted about his strike rate. The 26-year-old, who also leads India in Tests and ODIs, had scored 46 off 39 balls in the fourth T20I — a knock that drew criticism despite setting up India’s win. But in Brisbane, Gill looked back in rhythm, smashing an unbeaten 29 off just 16 balls, laced with six fours, before rain halted play with India cruising at 52 for no loss in 4.5 overs.Suryakumar praised Gill’s intent and chemistry with Abhishek, describing their partnership as pure aggression.“They both are looking to match each other’s strike rates. It’s a combination of fire and fire,” said Suryakumar. “If the wicket is a bit difficult, it’s important to adapt. Today, the wicket was good, so they scored more than 50 in five overs. In the last game, it was important to read the wicket — and these two did just that.Gill showed great maturity. Both have good communication; they complement each other perfectly. ”Since Gill’s return to the T20I fold as vice-captain, Sanju Samson has been pushed down the order, eventually making way for Jitesh Sharma . Yet, Suryakumar’s words reaffirm the team’s trust in Gill’s evolving T20 game.Abhishek, who was named Player of the Series for his 163 runs in five matches, echoed his captain’s sentiment, lauding Gill’s awareness and their long-standing bond.“It’s just fire and fire. We’ve been playing together since U-12 days, so there’s great understanding. I know which bowlers he’s targeting and vice versa. He also guides me on which shots to play,” Abhishek said.","India captain Suryakumar Yadav has come out strongly in support of Shubman Gill.

"Ranji Trophy: Musheer Khan, Siddhesh Lad hundreds lead Mumbai's fightback against Himachal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ranji-trophy-musheer-khan-siddhesh-lad-hundreds-lead-mumbais-fightback-against-himachal/articleshow/125186156.cms,"Siddhesh Lad

MUMBAI: Owing to their wobbly top order these days, Mumbai seem to have developed a habit of staging stirring fightbacks.On Saturday morning, Day One of their Ranji Trophy Elite Group D match against Himachal Pradesh at the MCA ground in BKC, they again fell into a pit after deciding to bat first, slipping to 35 for three and then 73 for four when they lost the key wicket of the out-of-touch Sarfaraz Khan (16, 57b, 2x4).However, Sarfaraz’s younger brother Musheer Khan (112, 162b, 14x4) and seasoned batsman Siddhesh Lad (100*, 207b, 14x4, 1x6), aptly called Mumbai’s ‘Crisis Man’, bailed the hosts out with their brilliant hundreds and a course-changing 157-run partnership for the fifth wicket that stonewalled Himachal for 234 balls.For 39 overs, the Musheer-Lad duo made the Himachal bowlers — initially on top on a pitch that always provides help to seamers in the morning but then eases out — toil for a wicket under the blazing sun. Between lunch and tea, the pair added 116 runs in 28 overs without being separated. After Musheer’s dismissal in the final session, Himachal heaved a huge sigh of relief. However, Lad put on an unbeaten 59-run stand for the sixth wicket in 137 balls with wicketkeeper-batter Akash Anand (26*, 86b, 3x4) as Mumbai finished on a strong 289 for five.It was a gritty effort from Musheer, who had to overcome the loss of his *mama* (maternal uncle) in the morning.The youngster was naturally in tears when he reached his third first-class ton, and his first since scoring 181 for India B against India A in Bengaluru in the Duleep Trophy in September last year. Staying put as Himachal’s seamers made the ball talk and achieved early breakthroughs, Musheer drove, cut, ramped and steered his way to an 86-ball fifty and then a 143-ball hundred — his first since suffering a horrific car accident in September last year that ruled him out of the previous season. Batting on 88, the 20-year-old was struck on the helmet by an Arpit Guleria bouncer, but the young turk soldiered on till he was bowled by left-arm spinner Mayank Dagar.Playing the role of an opener this season, Musheer initially struggled for form and was dismissed for scores of 0 and 8 (vs Jammu & Kashmir) and 12 (vs Chhattisgarh), but found rhythm when he notched up scores of 49 and 63 against Rajasthan in Jaipur.Siddhesh, on the other hand, has been in tremendous touch this season, which has seen the 33-year-old cross the 5,000-run landmark in first-class cricket . In four matches of the 2025-26 Ranji Trophy season so far, Lad, with 333 runs at an average of 83.25 till date, is the highest run-getter for Mumbai. This was his 12th first-class century and his second in this edition of the Ranji Trophy, which too came when Mumbai were looking shaky at 74 for three against Jammu & Kashmir in Srinagar.On Saturday, he looked in smooth flow from the first ball he faced, unleashing his drives, cuts and pulls against the pacers and sweeping and driving down the ground against the spinners with ease.Mumbai suffered early blows as India Under-19 captain Ayush Mhatre, coming off scores of 65 and 6 for India A against South Africa A in the first ‘Test’ at the CoE in Bengaluru, was castled by pacer Vipin Sharma for 9 (8b, 2x4) in just the second over. Barring that one half-century for India A, Mhatre has endured a lean period lately, having had a poor time in Australia with the Colts team and in the Ranji Trophy for Mumbai.The next to go was former Mumbai captain Ajinkya Rahane, who scratched around for two off 17 balls before being caught at slip by Ankit Kalsi off Guleria. Apart from his 159 against Chhattisgarh at BKC, Rahane’s scores this season have been 27 and 0 (vs Jammu & Kashmir), 3 and 18 (vs Rajasthan in Jaipur) and 2 in the first innings of this match.For some reason, Mumbai have shown more faith than necessary in off-spinner Himanshu Singh’s batting by sending him at No. 4 this season. It took just one ball for Guleria to clean up Himanshu’s stumps and expose Mumbai’s decision in poor light.For a while, as the Khan brothers added 35 in 108 balls, Mumbai seemed on the road to recovery before Himachal and Kolkata Knight Riders’ quick Vaibhav Arora trapped Sarfaraz — who is enduring his first poor domestic season, in which his highest score is 42 — lbw while trying to play across.",Mumbai defeat Himachal Pradesh in Ranji Trophy Elite Group D match.

BENGALURU: When Dhruv Jurel was handed the Test cap last year against England in Rajkot, there was no shortage of doubters. After all, he was light on red-ball experience. Coming into the team in the absence of Rishabh Pant and on the back of the decision to switch KL Rahul back as a specialist batter, he made a lasting impression with a patient 46. He's played six more Test matches and has averaged a shade less than 48, yet with Pant back after a three-month injury lay-off, Jurel's keeping gloves will probably be put away.But with the kind of statements he has been making with the bat, it's hard not to look for a place for him in a playing XI.On Day 3 of the four-day game between India 'A' and South Africa here on Saturday, Jurel came out to bat with the hosts at 108/4. KL Rahul was back in the dressing room and Pant, after taking three blows on his helmet, left-arm and abdomen, retired hurt. What followed was a repeat show of the first innings, as the 24-year-old followed up his unbeaten 132 with a classy unconquered 127 (170b; 15x4; 1x6).He found a perfect ally in Harsh Dubey, who scored a well-crafted 116-ball 84 (12z4; 1x6), during their 184-run association for the sixth wicket.India 'A', who started the day on 78/3, declared at 382/7 in 89.2 overs, setting the visitors a target of 417.At the BCCI Centre of Excellence, South Africa 'A' were 25 for no loss in 11 overs at stumps, needing 392 runs on the final day to avoid a 2-0 washout. India' A' won the opening fixture by three wickets.Much like his first-innings performance, Jurel put up a near-flawless show on Saturday. The only chance the away side probably had to get his wicket was when a left-arm spinner, Kyle Simmonds' delivery, scraped the stumps when Jurel was on 49, but the bails stayed intact.Jurel brought up his 50 in 83 deliveries, while Dubey, who was put down at slips off the first delivery he faced, consumed 76 balls. South Africa 'A' finally managed to break the partnership with the new ball as Dubey swung his bat at a Tshepo Moreki delivery, which was taken by Simmonds at first slip.Jurel signalled his 14th first-class century, flicking Tiaan Van Vuuren through midwicket for a four.Pant took three blows on a lively wicket and finally, on 17, the team thinktank asked him to head back. On the fall of Dubey's wicket, he returned, took another hit on the right arm, before switching on his T20 mode. He scored an entertaining 54-ball 65 (5x4; 4x6), before top edging Simmonds to wicketkeeper Connor Esterhuizen. India 'A' declared soon after. He returned to keep wickets and showed no signs of discomfort.India 'A' 225 & 382/7 in 89.2 overs (KL Rahul 27, Rishabh Pant 65, Dhruv Jurel 127 n.o, Harsh Dubey 84; Okuhke Cele 3-46) vs South Africa 'A': 221 & 25 for no loss in 11 overs.","Dhruv Jurel scored 127 not out on Day 3 of India 'A' vs South Africa 'A's Test match. The 24-year-old followed up his unbeaten 132 in the first innings. He found a perfect ally in Harsh Dubey, who scored 84 (12z4; 1x6), during their 184-run association.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125185675,imgsize-110274,width-400,resizemode-4/dhruv-jurel.jpg"

Inside the last hit! How India trained during their final practice session in Australia

Poll Will Abhishek Sharma make the T20 World Cup squad next year? Yes, he deserves it Maybe, depending on future performances

NEW DELHI: Abhishek Sharma ’s breakout series in Australia was no accident — it was the result of months of preparation, focus, and belief. The 25-year-old left-hander, who bagged the Player of the Series award in India’s rain-marred 2-1 T20I triumph, revealed that he had trained “mentally and technically” to take on the challenge of bouncy Australian pitches and world-class fast bowlers.“I have been waiting for this series. When I got to know we’re going to Australia for the T20Is, I was very excited,” Abhishek said after India clinched the series in Brisbane on Saturday. “Throughout my career, I’ve seen that Australia is very batting-friendly, and I wanted to prepare myself for these kinds of bowlers and conditions.”He finished with 163 runs in five outings — a consistent presence at the top even as two games were washed out. Abhishek said his training in recent months focused specifically on handling high pace and bounce.“If you want to play good cricket and do well for your team, you have to face world-class bowlers. I was practicing for these kinds of bowlers because that’s how you improve as a player,” he said, when asked if Josh Hazlewood’s absence in the last three matches made life easier for the Indian batters.The Punjab opener credited India’s think-tank for giving him clarity and the confidence to play with freedom.“The captain and coach have given me the clarity and confidence to just go and express myself. As a batter, when you're scoring 20s and 30s, you know you can go longer, but the clarity to set the momentum for the team has really helped me.”Looking ahead, Abhishek said the series had strengthened his resolve to push for a place in next year’s T20 World Cup squad. “It will be a dream come true if I get to play the World Cup. As a kid, I always dreamt of winning it for India. I will make sure I’m ready for that tournament.”India skipper Suryakumar Yadav lauded the collective effort behind the comeback after losing the second T20I. “The way everyone chipped in and the way we came back from 0-1 down, credit to all the boys,” he said.Australia captain Mitchell Marsh , meanwhile, congratulated India and said, “All in all, it was a great series. India obviously won the games when it mattered — congratulations to them.”",Abhishek Sharma won the Player of the Series award in India’s 2-1 T20I triumph.

PANAJI: Indian football faces possibly its greatest battle for identity and survival, after the tender floated by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) for awarding its commercial rights to run the top-tier Indian Super League (ISL) found no bidders.The start of the league, which kicked off on Sept 13 last year, has already been delayed with the federation mandating the new partners to start the top league in December. But with no bidder stepping forward, further delays are inevitable. There are also doubts whether there will be enough time to complete the 24 league matches in a home and away format, necessary for a continental license.“No bids were received within the stipulated timeframe. The AIFF bid evaluation committee will convene over the weekend to review the situation and deliberate on the future course of action,” AIFF said.“This is bad news for Indian football ,” a senior club official told TOI. “The uncertainty could force clubs to shut down or take drastic measures like cutting budgets and player salaries.”The AIFF’s existing partnership with Reliance-subsidiary Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) ends in a month’s time, on Dec 8. The FSDL was keen on continuing its partnership with Indian football, apparently made inquiries, formally asked over a hundred questions about the tender, but did not submit a bid before the deadline.In fact, the other three companies who attended the pre-bid meeting — FanCode, RAAK Group and a Monaco-based foreign consortium with business in Slovakia — also stayed away, leaving AIFF and Indian football in the dark over not just the future of the top league but also the season. The future of clubs and players’ earnings have been left in great doubt.The absence of any bidders also put a question mark on the credibility on the current dispensation at the helm of the AIFF, with potential corporate partners, if any, hesitant to work with the federation brass. “The model the AIFF has proposed is unsustainable. It has sought to retain control while the company is expected to spend the money,” said the official.","Indian football faces possibly its greatest battle for identity and survival.

Panaji: The national football team could have an entirely different look if, as expected, more players follow in the footsteps of Ryan Williams, who has surrendered his Australian citizenship and taken up an Indian passport to be eligible to represent the country.Coach Khalid Jamil will also have a look at Nepal-born Abneet Bharti, currently plying his trade for Academia del Balompie Boliviano in the Bolivian Premier Division. The players are expected to join the national team camp in Bengaluru, and should they impress the coach, they’ll be on the flight to Dhaka for the AFC Asian Cup final round qualifier against Bangladesh on Nov 18.“The inclusion of these players is a good start,” Jamil told TOI over the phone on Friday. “There are four to five other players who we will call in the future. For now, we will have these two players at the camp.”Given the lack of goalscorers, the inclusion of Williams, a junior international with Australia, and now an established winger will provide more options upfront. The Bengaluru FC captain scored three goals in as many games for his club in the Super Cup, as Jamil watched from the stands in Goa.“Ryan will be useful for the national team. He now has an Indian passport and is into his third season with Bengaluru FC.He is experienced, and his versatility in particular is very good,” said Jamil.Williams, 32, has played once before for the Australian national team against South Korea in a non-competitive game and made a move to Bengaluru, from A-League side Perth Glory, in 2023.Jamil has only watched Bharti’s videos from his recent performances in the Bolivian top division and believes the centre-back, who had a brief spell with Kerala Blasters in the past, can be a good addition to the team.“I have seen his videos (of training) and some games too. Let’s have a look at him (during the camp) and then we can decide,” said Jamil, about the 27-year-old who has had an unconventional career across Asia, Europe, and South America.The inclusion of the new players, particularly Williams, has got Indian football buzzing with former captain Sunil Chhetri among those who believes there can be a new beginning.“We now have No. 9, someone who we can rely on. He’s somebody who has goals in him, an absolutely brilliant boy. I hope he wins the dressing room, and I hope he wins the heart of the Indian people,” said Chhetri.Chhetri, India’s highest goal-scorer and most-capped footballer, said his Bengaluru teammate had told him about wanting to surrender his Australian citizenship for an Indian passport nearly 18 months ago.“At that time, he wasn’t sure that he can play for the country,” said Chhetri. “I asked him, ‘you want to leave your passport?’ He said yes. I told Kalyan da (Kalyan Chaubey, president of the All India Football Federation) let’s take it step by step, give it a push, make it happen. This is the first time in my life that I heard of a player, a foreigner, who wanted to give up his passport and play for India.”","Ryan Williams has surrendered his Australian citizenship and taken up an Indian passport to be eligible to represent the country.

NFL’s emotional tribute to Marshawn Kneeland



More NFL coverage

The NFL community is reeling from the tragic death of Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland, who was found dead on Thursday morning in what authorities described as an apparent suicide. Kneeland, just 24, had been a promising young star for the Cowboys, drafted 56th overall in 2024, and his sudden passing has sent shockwaves across the league. In response, the NFL has taken steps to ensure his memory is honored across all 32 franchises this weekend.According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, the league issued a memo to every team, requesting that Week 10 games begin with a moment of silence for the late Cowboys player. “The NFL sent a memo to all teams Friday, asking them to hold a moment of silence Sunday as part of the pre-game ceremonies in memory of the late Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland,” Schefter reported.Following the moment of silence, every stadium will share a message urging fans to seek help if they’re struggling: “If you or someone you know is struggling or needs emotional support, please call or text 988. The Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is available 24-7 to help.”The powerful message serves as both a tribute and a reminder of the importance of mental health awareness.The Cowboys confirmed the heartbreaking news on November 6, stating, “It is with extreme sadness that the Dallas Cowboys share that Marshawn Kneeland tragically passed away this morning. Marshawn was a beloved teammate and member of our organization. Our thoughts and prayers regarding Marshawn are with his girlfriend Catalina and his family.”According to reports, Kneeland texted his family goodbye before taking his own life. Police later found his crashed vehicle on the Dallas Parkway, only minutes from the Cowboys’ facility. The tragedy came just days after one of the most joyful moments of his young career—his first NFL touchdown on Monday Night Football.Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott , who lost his own brother to suicide, spoke with deep emotion about the loss. “This is a pain that you don't wish upon anybody,” Prescott said. “You wish none of us had to go through this. You wish Marshawn didn't have to go through what he went through.”As the league gathers to remember Marshawn Kneeland this Sunday, the tributes will not only honor a talented young player but also echo a larger message—one of compassion, connection, and the urgent need to talk about mental health before it’s too late.",Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland was found dead on Thursday.

NFL fines Josh Allen and Elijah Moore for 'violent gestures' celebration



More NFL Coverage

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen ’s incredible performance against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 9 came at a small but costly price. The NFL fined Allen $14,491 for unsportsmanlike conduct after what the league described as “a violent gesture. ” His teammate, wide receiver Elijah Moore, was also docked $13,888 for his role in the same celebration.The incident occurred late in the third quarter after Allen’s one-yard touchdown run extended Buffalo’s lead to 28–13. In the moment of excitement, Allen and Moore exchanged finger-gun gestures—a move that seemed harmless but ran afoul of the league’s growing crackdown on “violent gestures” of any kind. Despite the light-hearted nature of the celebration, the NFL’s Office of Gameday Accountability determined it fell under unsportsmanlike conduct.“It’s just one of those areas that the league wants to work actively on,” said NFL officiating and rules analyst Walt Anderson in August. “There are plenty of ways for players to be able to celebrate, and they come up with some very unique and often entertaining ways so we want them to focus on those and not the inappropriate areas.”For Allen, the fine slightly overshadowed what was otherwise a record-breaking outing.The quarterback completed 23 of 26 passes for 273 yards and a touchdown, setting a franchise record with an 88.5% completion rate. He also rushed for 19 yards and two scores, surpassing Cam Newton’s all-time record for rushing touchdowns by a quarterback with his 77th and 78th career runs into the end zone.After the game, Allen reflected on how he felt in rhythm from the very first drive. “To be candid, you feel it in your mechanics sometimes,” Allen said. “Early on in the game, you know when you’re — I call it ‘slotted.’ When the ball is coming out of your hand as good as you really want it. I had a really good feeling early on in this game.”The Bills eventually secured a 28–21 victory, tightening their race with the Patriots for the AFC East crown. Next up, Buffalo travels south to face the Miami Dolphins on Sunday — hoping to keep their momentum rolling, fines or not.",NFL fines Josh Allen and Elijah Moore for 'violent gestures' celebration.

Former NFL player Matt Kalil has unexpectedly become the centre of viral attention after a deeply personal revelation from his ex-wife, influencer Haley Kalil. During a live stream with Marlon Garcia, Haley made headlines by suggesting that the “biggest factor” in their 2022 divorce was her ex-husband’s rather unique anatomy. What began as a candid chat quickly turned into a viral sensation—one that an adult entertainment company now wants to turn into a business opportunity worth $300,000.While the couple had officially cited “irreconcilable differences” in their divorce filings, Haley later admitted that their intimacy struggles played a larger role. “We tried it all: therapist, doctors.

When the New England Patriots visit Tampa Bay this Sunday, fans are bracing for a matchup that feels larger than life. Both teams—Patriots at 7-2 and Buccaneers at 6-2—are in fierce midseason form. Yet what truly makes this contest special is the voice behind the excitement: Tom Brady, the man who defined both franchises. Ahead of the showdown, the seven-time Super Bowl champion shared his anticipation, calling it a potential “Game of the Year alert.”“This team doesn’t always get mentioned in the same breath as the Eagles, the Chiefs, and the Bills, but they should. The Bucs come off their bye week at No. 3, setting up a huge showdown with the Pats in Tampa,” Brady said. “We’ve got two teams who might feel like they have something to prove. Yeah, I like that. And that usually results in a great football game. Game of the year alert? I think so. Just don’t ask me to pick any sides here. ”Tom Brady’s football journey remains unmatched. Over 23 NFL seasons, he became the face of two iconic franchises. For two decades in New England, he turned the Patriots into a dynasty—winning six Super Bowls, earning four Super Bowl MVPs, and claiming two NFL MVP titles.His 219-64 regular-season record and 74,571 passing yards still stand as benchmarks of greatness.When Brady left for Tampa Bay in 2020, many doubted he could repeat his success. Yet, he silenced critics by leading the Buccaneers to a Super Bowl LV win in his debut season, adding a seventh ring and a new chapter to his remarkable story. His two-year stint in Tampa produced 108 touchdown passes and another Super Bowl MVP honor—proof that age could never dull his competitive fire.Now, as a Fox Sports commentator, Brady won’t be calling Sunday’s game—it airs on CBS—but he’s still watching closely. “Just... don’t ask me to pick any sides here,” he joked, a line that reflects his enduring bond with both teams.Whether seen as a Patriot legend or Buccaneer icon, Tom Brady continues to command the spotlight. And as his two former teams collide in Tampa, the football world will once again revolve around the man who defined an era.",The New England Patriots visit the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday. Tom Brady called the game a potential “Game of the Year alert.” The Patriots are 7-2 and the Buccaneers are 6-2 in the NFC South.

Travis Kelce didn’t just step out for date night in New York City, he stepped directly into another viral fashion breakdown that now has Swifties, menswear analysts, and NFL diehards all dissecting what his latest “redwood-coded” outfit really means. With Taylor Swift by his side and the world watching their every quiet move in the wake of their engagement, Kelce’s wardrobe is no longer viewed as a throwaway tunnel walk moment.It has become a conversation piece. It’s intentional branding, fandom signaling, and high-end marketing all happening in real time. And the fact that the Kansas City Chiefs tight end leans into Taylor’s creative universe only intensifies the cultural crossover; sports, fashion, music all merging into one.Travis Kelce’s reddish-brown Tru Kolors corduroy set, which fans instantly linked to “the redwood factor” after Taylor Swift compared his body to the world’s tallest tree in “Wood”, is more than clothing. It’s a wink. A wink at pop culture. A wink at Swift’s new album era. A wink at the idea that what he wears is now part of a bigger storyline.He layered the $80 mechanic jacket with stacked gold chains and paired them with Louis Vuitton x Timberland boots, while Swift matched the vibe with head-to-toe Louis Vuitton, black tights, black ribbed knit, legacy boots, and lipstick red glamour.It’s not try-hard. If anything, it’s almost casual. Two megastars with unimaginable economic reach, intentionally under-doing the match moment while still looking editorial.Their back-to-back date nights this week in NYC line up perfectly with the Chiefs’ bye week, which means Kelce finally has breathing room. And ironically, that’s when his fashion becomes the headline. He doesn’t need the stadium tunnel to go viral anymore, now the sidewalks do it for him.From a business point of view, this is co-branding, not coincidence and both of them know exactly what they’re doing. Ultimately, this isn’t just about clothes, it’s about symbolism, narrative control, and two powerful brands turning casual moments into global talking points. And every subtle outfit choice only tightens the grip they already have on pop culture.","Travis Kelce’s reddish-brown Tru Kolors corduroy set, which fans instantly linked to “the redwood factor” after Taylor Swift compared his body to the world’S tallest tree in “Wood”, is more than clothing.

President Donald Trump’s stadium name push stirs political and sports debate





More NFL coverage

President Donald Trump is reportedly pushing for the Washington Commanders’ upcoming $3.7 billion stadium in Washington, D.C. to bear his name, according to a new report from ESPN. The report claims that “a senior White House source has been in contact with a member of the Commanders’ owners group about the president’s desire. ” Adding to the intrigue, the source told ESPN, “It’s what the president wants, and it will probably happen.”The White House hasn’t confirmed the behind-the-scenes discussions, but Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt didn’t shy away from praising the idea. “That would be a beautiful name, as it was President Trump who made the rebuilding of the new stadium possible,” Leavitt said when asked about the ongoing talks. Her comment, though diplomatic, added more weight to speculation that the administration is actively involved in influencing the stadium’s future.According to ESPN, the final decision on naming the new stadium isn’t solely up to the Commanders. While the team holds the naming rights—typically reserved for lucrative corporate sponsorships—sources indicated that the District of Columbia Council and the National Park Service will have the ultimate say.Both entities are managing the land and leasing terms for the stadium, which will replace the historic RFK site and is slated to open in 2030.The $3.7 billion project, led by the Commanders’ ownership group under Josh Harris, will see $2.7 billion funded privately and around $1 billion coming from public subsidies. Washington D.C. approved the plan in September, marking a major milestone for the franchise’s long-awaited return to the capital.Trump’s involvement in the project isn’t new. Back in July, he publicly threatened to delay the stadium’s progress unless the team reverted to its former “Redskins” name. “The Washington ‘Whatever’s’ should immediately change their name back to the Washington Redskins Football Team. There is a big clamoring for this,” he wrote on Truth Social.Now, as Trump prepares to attend the Commanders’ home game against the Detroit Lions this weekend, speculation is intensifying. Team sources told ESPN that while “no formal discussions” have yet taken place, owners “anticipate possible conversations” with the president during the event.Whether or not the stadium ends up bearing Trump’s name, one thing is certain: his influence on Washington’s football future continues to spark fierce debate across politics, sports, and public opinion alike.","President Donald Trump is reportedly pushing for the Washington Commanders’ upcoming $3.7 billion stadium to bear his name.

Gisele Bündchen seems to be living her happiest chapter yet, and she isn’t hiding it. The Brazilian supermodel recently shared a rare, tender glimpse into her life with boyfriend Joaquim Valente, celebrating his birthday with a message that radiated love and contentment. On Friday, November 7, Bündchen posted on Instagram Stories, writing in Portuguese, ""Feliz aniversário @joaquimvalente! Te amo!"" The photo captured the couple walking hand in hand along a serene beach at sunset, their baby nestled between them—a portrait of calm and joy.The post comes nearly two years after her high-profile divorce from NFL legend Tom Brady, marking how far she’s come since then. Gisele, 45, has found a new sense of peace and fulfillment with Valente, 38, a jiu-jitsu instructor from Florida. Their romance, which began in June 2023, blossomed into a close-knit family earlier this year when they welcomed their first child together.While her past with Brady—father to her two older children, Benjamin and Vivian—remains a significant part of her life, Gisele’s focus today is on wellness, family, and emotional growth. Just weeks before Valente’s birthday, she shared another glimpse of her active lifestyle on Instagram, including moments of her practicing yoga, surfing, cycling, and jiu-jitsu with Valente.Alongside the clips, she wrote, ""If there’s one thing I’d recommend to everyone, it’s this: move your body. Your body is your home — and it was made to move.""The couple’s bond was first built through their shared passion for fitness and martial arts. Valente, who first met Gisele through his Miami-based academy, became not just her coach but her companion through life’s transitions. Their connection, rooted in discipline and mutual respect, evolved naturally over time, long before it became public.For Gisele, this relationship represents healing and renewal. Her posts no longer echo the turbulence of the past but instead reflect calm confidence and gratitude. The woman once caught in the glare of one of the world’s most famous marriages now seems anchored in something much simpler—love, family, and inner balance.With her heartfelt birthday message, Gisele Bündchen didn’t just wish Joaquim Valente well; she reminded the world that she has found peace where it matters most—at home, in her heart.","Gisele Bündchen shared a touching message for boyfriend Joaquim Valente.

Linebacker Trevor Nowaske said, “That’ll be something I’ll be able to tell my kids, I played in front of the president. That’ll be sweet.” Cornerback Amik Robertson added jokingly, “Appreciate him coming out, but I sure hope he ain’t coming out there to see a Washington win. ”The Commanders enter Week 10 facing challenges on the field. The team has lost four consecutive games and will be without star quarterback Jayden Daniels, who suffered an arm injury in Week 9. Daniels is expected to miss at least the next two games, with a potential return following the Week 12 bye. At 3-6, every remaining game is critical for Washington’s hopes of returning to postseason contention.While the Lions aim to secure a win on the road, the presence of President Trump could energize the Commanders and their fans.

Is Kyler Murray DONE at the Arizona Cardinals? 👀 'He's played his LAST SNAP!' - Dan O | First Take

More coverage in NFL:

Kyler Murray’s future with the Arizona Cardinals is now one of the most discussed topics in the NFL. Murray is sidelined with a foot injury, and in his absence, Jacoby Brissett has led the Cardinals offense to surprising success. With Arizona performing well without him, questions are mounting about whether Murray will retain the starting job when healthy. ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports a post-season conversation between Murray and the Cardinals is expected, with a split appearing increasingly likely.Even with inconsistent performances this season, Murray remains a talented NFL quarterback with significant trade value. Cutting him would create a major dead-cap hit for Arizona, making a trade the most realistic scenario. Two teams that could pursue Murray are the Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings, both dealing with uncertainty at quarterback.The Steelers’ interest depends on Aaron Rodgers’ future. At 41, Rodgers has hinted at retirement, leaving Mason Rudolph and Will Howard as unproven options. Acquiring Murray would give Pittsburgh a proven, young starter to lead their offense. Meanwhile, the Vikings are still evaluating J.J.McCarthy. Although McCarthy has shown potential, inconsistency could push Minnesota to explore veteran options, and Murray could fill that role.If a trade happens, it would likely involve Arizona covering part of Murray’s sizable contract. If all conditions align, a move to Pittsburgh or Minnesota is possible. Murray’s potential relocation could reshape the quarterback landscape, giving one of these teams a strong starter while forcing the Cardinals to rethink their offense.Murray is expected to draw interest from other teams as well. His experience and skill make him one of the more valuable quarterbacks available, and any team in need of a proven starter could consider making a move. The Cardinals’ decision will likely have ripple effects across the league, shaping quarterback strategies and offseason plans for multiple franchises.Kyler Murray’s future with the Arizona Cardinals is at a critical point. How the team handles the post-season could change his career and impact quarterback plans for other NFL teams heading into next season.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

NEW DELHI: In a video posted by the Rajasthan Royals on their social media accounts, Vaibhav Suryavanshi is seen clarifying to Punjab Kings' Musheer Khan that he wasn't crying after getting out. He clarified: ""When did I cry? Let me explain. My eyes were hurting a lot. When I got out, I looked at the big screen and the light hit my eyes. So I had to rub my eyes.""Since then, the 14-year-old prodigy has smoked a 35-ball century and a 15-ball 40. But on Tuesday at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi, he showed a different side to his batting.Vaibhav has caught the eye with his shot-making and six-hitting prowess, but against CSK , he showed maturity beyond his age. He put on a 98-run second-wicket partnership with Sanju Samson that kind of sealed the deal for the Royals.Royals batting coach Vikram Rathour hailed Suryavanshi's 33-ball 57 in their six-wicket win over CSK.""Very impressive,"" Rathour told reporters here.""Again, we've been working with him for quite some time now, maybe three to four months. So, we've seen all these aspects, but it's great to see him doing that in a game, in pressure situations, in a big game like even today. The ball was doing a bit when he went in, he hardly got any balls, and didn't get on strike too much in the power play.""But again, the kind of maturity he showed, the kind of temperament he showed, was really good for him. And these kinds of experiences will definitely make him a better player in the coming time,"" said Rathour.Suryavanshi lost opening partner Yashasvi Jaiswal relatively early, having faced only three balls until Jaiswal got out in 3.4 overs. He scored only 12 from his first 10 balls.But Suryavanshi took charge after Jaiswal fell, swinging his 11th ball for six off Noor Ahmed and driving the next two deliveries for four through the covers. He hit two massive sixes over long-on in one over off Ravindra Jadeja and reached his fifty in 27 balls by heaving Noor over square leg for his fourth six.The left-hander was dismissed after 33 deliveries when he played a wild swipe to off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin and was caught at backward point.This time around, he did look dejected and trudged back visibly upset with himself.Suryavanshi made headlines last October when, aged 13, he scored a 58-ball century for India Under-19s in a Youth Test against Australia U-19s in Chennai.Rathour, who was also part of the Team India setup as batting coach, said he was ""sold"" when he first saw Suryavanshi bat in the nets.""There's a team on the back end who watch all the leagues, all kinds of cricket. And they recommended him. He scored that 100 against Australia U-19, I think. So, the recommendation was made. And honestly, when I saw him for the first time, I was sold.""Just with the downswing of his bat, I think he's very, very unique. I haven't seen something like that for a long, long time. And then he's now showing that he's got temperament as well. So, I think he's going to be a very, very special player,"" said Rathour with a beaming smile on his face.Suryavanshi, who only turned 14 last month and was signed at last year's auction for Rs 1.1 crore, became the youngest player to feature in the IPL earlier in April and made an immediate impact by hitting his first ball for six on his debut, which he had predicted in front of a teammate in another video circulating on social media.""We saw him for the first time. He's been batting in the nets, and we saw what he could do. But then, again, to do it in a game situation is something altogether different. But doing it once is, again, something different. But then, scoring runs the last game, and even today's knock was, I think, even better because he showed a different side of his temperament or his batting,"" said Rathour.At the start of the tournament, Suryavanshi was in contention to play. He got the chance only because Rajasthan Royals' skipper Sanju Samson got injured.Royals skipper Sanju Samson, too, has lavished praise on Suryavanshi and was in awe of his maturity after his knock against CSK.""I don't have words for him,"" Rajasthan Royals captain Sanju Samson said at the post-match presentation.""He can hit over the leg side, he can wait and hit slower balls over covers for six. That tells you what kind of talent and temperament he has. Today when the middle overs were going on, he smartly picked his options,"" Samson said.""Today when the middle overs were going on, he smartly picked his options. It shows he is smart as well. That is a stunning combination with the potential, talent, and game awareness. There is something special for Indian cricket.""In his first IPL edition, the boy from Samastipur, Bihar, has shown that age doesn't matter much, because what's beyond doubt is that he is very young, gifted, and has the world at his feet. In seven outings, he scored 252 runs with a strike rate of 206.56.He has shown a teaser to the whole world, and he is only 14. And Royals coach Rahul Dravid has said that the teenager is still an unfinished article, which certainly is not a good sign for the bowlers in the future.",Rajasthan Royals' Vaibhav Suryavanshi scored 33-ball 57 in their six-wicket win over CSK.

We wanted just a good performance. We're trying to string some performances together. The aim was two good performances. Now it'll be one good one to finish. It's probably fitting that we're at the bottom,"" he told reporters after Rajasthan Royals defeated CSK by six wickets on Tuesday evening.""We've played that type of cricket, so you can't hide away from it. But what we do want to do is just put in a much better performance that reflects the ability of the team.""Rajasthan Royals' bowlers executed their plans to perfection in the final overs. They consistently nailed their yorkers, effectively drying up the boundaries and stifling CSK's scoring rate. Shivam Dube (39) and MS Dhoni (16) both departed in the final over, as CSK managed a mere 17 runs in the last three overs, ultimately finishing on 187/8.At one stage, CSK were looking to cross 200, but Dube and Dhoni failed to provide the final flourish.Fleming accepted that it is a worrying sign for CSK that they need to fix in the next season.""Our lower order is not right at this stage, and that is something that we are always looking to rejig. We've got some strong ideas for next year, so that all facets are covered. But that hasn't been possible this year because of the lack of runs at the top.""A lot of the batting positions are determined by how well a start we have, and then guys can fall into line. So we haven't had that. So we've been just patching innings up, really, rather than constructing good innings,"" he said.",Stephen Fleming says Chennai Super Kings deserved to be at the bottom of the points table.

'Chances are still there': Abishek Porel believes in IPL 2025 playoff miracle

NEW DELHI: Indian Test cricket has entered a new era as three of its modern-day greats -- Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , and Ravichandran Ashwin -- have all stepped away from the longest format of the game.While fans continue to process the emotional exits, Rajasthan Royals ' batting coach Vikram Rathour, who is also the former batting coach of the Indian men's cricket team, shared heartfelt thoughts on the matter.“Retirement is a very personal decision,” Rathour said. “I would have loved to see all three of them continue playing. They were phenomenal cricketers and still had so much to offer. But if they've taken this call, we must respect that.”The comments come at a time when India is undergoing a major transition in red-ball cricket, preparing to move into a new World Test Championship cycle without some of its most experienced pillars.Recently, veteran spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, speaking on his YouTube channel, echoed similar sentiments.He acknowledged the reality of the game, saying, “Even someone like Sachin Tendulkar had to retire one day.” Ashwin praised Kohli’s aggression and energy and Rohit’s calm and composed style. “What Kohli achieved, Rohit could have too — if not for that ankle injury early in his career,” he added, referencing a missed Test debut that changed Rohit’s trajectory.As fans reel from these back-to-back announcements, India’s bench strength is now under the spotlight.Meanwhile, in the IPL, a young star is already making waves. Vaibhav Suryavanshi , just 14, top-scored with a brilliant 57 as Rajasthan Royals ended their season on a high, beating CSK by six wickets. Despite individual efforts from CSK batters like Ayush Mhatre and Dewald Brevis, the loss could see MS Dhoni’s men finish last for the first time in IPL history.","Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravichandran Ashwin have all retired from Test cricket.

Greenstone Lobo predicts Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma's ODI future

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings ' struggles while defending a total in IPL 2025 continued, as they lost all five matches this season when batting first. On Tuesday, Rajasthan Royals handed them another defeat, chasing down 188 with six wickets in hand at the Arun Jaitley Stadium.It was Rajasthan’s eighth win in their last ten encounters with CSK since 2020, further highlighting Chennai’s ongoing issues against the Royals.Despite finishing a disappointing season, the Royals found some joy thanks to teenage sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi . The 14-year-old continued to shine, scoring a mature 57 off 33 balls. His knock, filled with confidence and clean hitting, helped RR close their season on a high. Yashasvi Jaiswal gave the team a flying start with a quick 36, while skipper Sanju Samson (41) played second fiddle in a 98-run partnership with Suryavanshi. The Royals looked in complete control for most of the chase.Even when three wickets fell quickly towards the end, Dhruv Jurel (31 not out) and Shimron Hetmyer (12 not out) ensured there were no hiccups, sealing victory with 17 balls to spare.Earlier, Chennai posted 187/8, but their innings was marked by inconsistency.Ayush Mhatre stood out with a blistering 43 off 20 balls, supported by Dewald Brevis (42) and Shivam Dube (39). However, once again, CSK’s middle order faltered, and the team collapsed after a promising start. MS Dhoni couldn’t provide the late flourish, scoring a slow 16 off 17 balls.CSK’s innings was derailed by sharp spells from Yudhvir Singh (3/47) and Akash Madhwal (3/29), who shared six wickets between them.This defeat leaves CSK needing a massive win in their final match to avoid finishing last in the points table for the first time in IPL history. For the Royals, though, this was a night to celebrate their young star and sign off with pride.","Chennai Super Kings have lost all five matches this season when batting first.

NEW DELHI : It was just past 3 pm. The temperature was a harsh 40 degrees Celsius. With the sun beating down, and humidity as well, the heat felt far oppressive. Unmindful, two fans dressed in a yellow No. 7 jersey were spotted on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg. Both were walking towards the Kotla ground like moths towards a flame. The CSK-RR game, scheduled to begin at 7.30 pm, was still over four hours away.It’s the power of being Mahendra Singh Dhoni . His relationship with CSK fans is one of the most enduring love stories of modern sport. And it is a pan-India phenomenon. Virat Kohli too can convert most stadiums across India into a home ground for his team. He is a serving international though. For someone who retired from international cricket five years ago, MSD’s unceasing ability to get jerseys on the back and bums on the seat would make any rock star envious.On Tuesday, it became increasingly evident as time rolled by. What started as a trickle slowly turned into a bustle. Yellow emerged as the dominant colour on the street. Seven was the only number on every CSK back.Before the game, CSK stood last in the IPL 2025 table. But every defeat this IPL season has made it even more apparent that Dhoni fans do not see this relationship through the prism of his performance with the bat. It is the memory of the 5 titles that CSK won under his leadership that’s hardwired into their hearts.It makes him performance-proof. “My love for him has nothing to do with the number of runs he scores,” says software developer Vikash Purbey in a Dhoni tee. And Kailash Chand Jain, who sells IPL jerseys across north Indian cities hosting IPL, says Dhoni still sells more shirts than any player, barring Kohli.On Tuesday too, the Kotla stands were largely an enthusiastic sea of yellow. A poster said, “Abhi na jao chhod kar, ke dil abhi bhara nahi.”That probably is the everlasting emotion of many CSK fans.",MS Dhoni's relationship with CSK fans is one of the most enduring love stories of modern sport.

'Chances are still there': Abishek Porel believes in IPL 2025 playoff miracle

Mumbai: Facing a do-or-die match against Delhi Capitals at the Wankhede Stadium on Wednesday night at the Wankhede Stadium, the Mumbai Indians players and fans are sure to have some jitters. With 14 points in their bag after 12 matches, MI must win their last two matches to secure their passage to the playoffs. Undeterred by the tricky situation, MI coach Mahela Jayawardene was pleased that the five-time IPL champions' fate was, after all, in their own hands.""Our match got pushed back and we had to wait for other results to happen, but I think we were always in contention for the playoffs after we had that run (six straight wins). The guys have been waiting for this (resumption), training has been pretty good and just take one game at a time and see what we need to do. It's (quest for the playoffs) in our control, it's a great position to be in but I can't predict what's going to happen,"" Jayawardene said.""The message from me for the boys was to make sure that we go through our routines, our processes, the way we train, the way we plan and the way we've gone about this tournament. I'm very happy with our intensity, the way they've reacted to certain situations and we just need to do the same, it's that simple. So, I'm not thinking ahead. We've had a good week's preparation and watched what the other teams were doing as well and how they've come about and we just need to go out and express ourselves and play a good game,"" the former Sri Lankan captain said.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Considering the possibility of rain impacting in the remainder of the league, the BCCI has decided to allot an extra couple of hours for each match. ""I mean obviously the weather has been threatening most of the games and it's a decision that they've collectively taken. If it helps, it helps but if you have serious rain, I don't know whether the extra hour is going to help but as long as we can get a game with the extension, everyone wants to play a game of cricket rather than not play,"" said Jayawardene.Sounding cautiously optimistic ahead of the ultra-crucial clash against DC, Jayawardene said, “What we can control is what we were given in preparation and then tomorrow’s game, so just take it that simply. I know you guys might think, how can it be? It’s a big game for us. But it’s still a game of cricket, whether it’s a World Cup final, whether it’s an IPL final. I can’t control the dynamics. I can’t control the fans or how the media is reacting to the whole thing. What I can control is to make sure the guys are focused on playing a game of cricket. It will be for them a normal game of cricket as long as I can get them to think like that. That’s the way forward.”",Mahela Jayawardene says Mumbai Indians' fate is in their own hands.

Viktor Gyökeres' prolific season and Arsenal's interest

Strategic fit and transfer value that make Gyökeres ideal for Arteta’s Arsenal

Arsenal are stepping up their pursuit of a striker this summer, with Sporting CP forward Viktor Gyökeres said to be high on their wishlist.

And manager Mikel Arteta has admitted he is ready to spend big to add to his attacking options, even if it means going over the club’s budget.Gyökeres's style of play suits Arteta's system. A player who is known for his physical approach, pace, and pressing, making him good in the air and pushing defenders to their limit, rendering him a striker capable of occupying the front line by himself. His versatility to adapt and his strong work ethic mean he is a candidate to be added to this Arsenal machine.Sporting CP is demanding €100 million for Gyökeres, but it is believed that they may be willing to come to the table at the €75–80 million level, presumably with payment and or player youth loan clauses. Sporting director Andrea Berta is said to be prioritising a deal for Gyökeres and is eager to get the deal done quickly to see off competition from other clubs such as Chelsea and Manchester United.Also Read: Viktor Gyokeres leads charge as Sporting Lisbon claim Primeira Liga title on tense final day The addition of Gyökeres potentially adds the firepower required for Arsenal’s charge for silverware next season.

Financial challenges and league requirements

Impact on players and future prospects

Blackburn Rovers have confirmed their withdrawal from the FA Women’s Championship due to being unable to fund their squad as a professional side. The club is now in discussions with the FA Women’s National League board regarding the level of the women’s football pyramid that the team will be operating in next season, with a decision to be confirmed in due course over the coming weeks.The move comes after the recent rebranding of the Women’s Championship, which, from next season, will require its clubs to run fully professional sides with increased support and facilities in order to protect player welfare and the integrity of competition. The increased demands on clubs are taking a huge toll financially, especially on smaller clubs.While the effort to save the club is in vain, league officials and other interested parties did what they could to help out Blackburn, who blamed unviable financial pressure for the situation, including ballooning wage bills and reliance on matchday revenue. Rovers cited further problems of stagnant home crowds, despite playing their matches at Ewood Park.There have been some grim reports of the club's financial shortcomings, with players on part-time contracts just being paid the minimum wage, which has brought public criticism from former players and leading figures in the sport. Players were also notified of the withdrawal via WhatsApp, underscoring communication problems in the club.Also Read: FA Cup: Tottenham Hotspur suffer two cup exits in a week after fourth-round defeat to Aston Villa The withdrawal has left players, coaches, and staff in limbo. Defender Niamh Murphy expressed her frustration on social media, revealing that management had issued a seven-day deadline for securing funding and criticizing the ongoing lack of financial support from the club. The team, which is coming off a 10th-place finish in the division despite having one of the smaller budgets, has a proud tradition of developing talents such as Georgia Stanway, Ella Toone, and Keira Walsh.The club's exit from the Championship has come in the wake of a similar announcement from Reading FC Women last year, which also cited financial pressures and an inability to comply with regulations. Such changes highlight the wider pressure point on women's football clubs to remain financially viable with higher professionalisation requirements.","Blackburn Rovers have confirmed their withdrawal from the FA Women's Championship.

It’s a very strong day for our package, which on the other side makes all of us happy.”He appeared calm and composed during the press conference as well. “We could have done things a bit differently to finish the race in first place. So on one side, a bit disappointed, I really wanted to win that race. On the other side, it was a good result for the team P3, strong day for us. It is what it is,” he said.Pascal Wehrlein currently stands second in the Formula E Driver Standings with 84 points.

Oliver Rowland takes over Japan



Nissan driver Oliver Rowland was among the favourites at the recently held Tokyo E-Prix, and it was a heartwarming sight to see him lifting the winner’s trophy with his daughter sharing the podium as he fulfilled the expectations of his fans on Nissan’s home soil. After securing the number two spot on the podium in Round 8, he went on to win the Round 9 race—his fourth victory of the 2025 Formula E World Championship .

His daughter also accompanied him in the paddock when the Qualifying session was delayed due to rain. Fans were charmed by her cuteness, especially when she asked him to show his car.Speaking about his strategy after winning the Tokyo race, Rowland said, “No words! I was not a master of strategy in the first half of the race, I was pretty disappointed in myself. But I figured out that everybody would kind of undercut me so I thought: ‘I’ve got six minutes, I’ll undercut them’ and in the end it worked. I knew they would all react. I just had to make the progress on the first lap so it paid off today, but I was a bit lucky.”Sharing his plan for the road ahead, he added, “I’ve always said that in Tokyo and Shanghai I need to keep pushing to extend the Championship lead.

First ever podium finish for Dan Ticktum

Dan Ticktum couldn’t hide his emotions after securing the first podium finish of his Formula E career, coming home third at the Tokyo E-Prix Round 9 on Sunday. The race was won by Nissan’s Oliver Rowland, who took a significant step closer to clinching the world championship title. Ticktum, driving for Cupra Kiro, was visibly elated after the race and shared a heartfelt message with his team over the radio.“Very good, gentlemen. Great job. Well done, everyone. I am so happy for you guys, I really am. Everyone doubts me, but I’m going to start proving them wrong. That’s nice. Many drivers are giving me thumbs up—how lovely. Right, I want a beer,” he said over the team radio.Sharing his feelings after the podium win, Dan Ticktum said: “It feels pretty good! I’m already like ‘if we had done this or done that’ I could have won, but I’m very happy overall and it’s a big boost for the team. I just don’t feel like we’ve ever had a breakthrough this season and that’s it. We’re really competing consistently at the top now across all conditions and the team executed a pretty flawless weekend - so I’m happy.”Talking further about the Tokyo race, he added, “There’s not a huge amount I could have done, there was quite a long time when I was forced to lead which was obviously not ideal, and then when me and Pascal [Wehrlein] went to take Attack Mode, Oli [Rowland] got in between us. I don’t know what more we could have done from our side really, just different strategies and it didn’t quite work out for P1 or P2, but ‘Driver of the Day’, I’ll take that - I thought everyone hated me! I’m happy, it’s good, thank you to everyone who voted for me, I appreciate it.”Also Read: Tokyo E-Prix Round 8 results: Stoffel Vandoorne clinches long-awaited win in wet conditions; Oliver Rowland finishes second Ticktum secured third place after capitalizing on Taylor Barnard’s late crash, which opened the door for the Briton to seal a well-deserved and memorable podium finish.

Formula E Drivers on racing in wet conditions

The excitement is building ahead of the next Formula E race as Japan gets ready to host the second season of the Tokyo E-Prix. But the weather forecast shows a 100 percent chance of rainfall on both Saturday and Sunday. This is enough to concern the Formula E drivers, as—despite the much-improved Gen3 Evo cars this year running on Hankook tyres—racing in rain comes with hard-to-overcome challenges and risks. However, the rain may skip the Round 9 race Sunday evening. Here’s the complete weather forecast for the Tokyo Formula E race.According to Metcheck.com, the weather in Tokyo is expected to remain pleasant at 21 degrees Celsius on Friday, though it will be a cloudy day. There are only slight chances of rain as the Formula E drivers take part in the First Free Practice session at 4 pm (local time) and 12:30 pm IST.The temperature will remain in the range of 18–20 degrees Celsius on Saturday. However, there is a 100 percent chance of rain throughout the day. Rain in the range of 2.6 mm to 3.3 mm is expected during the Second Free Practice at 8 am (local time) and the Qualifying race at 10:20 am (local time). The rain is expected to be much lighter, at 0.9 mm, during the main Round 8 race at 3:05 pm (local time), which will be broadcast in India at 11:35 am.The temperature will be in the range of 19–20 degrees Celsius on Sunday, while the rain will continue to be as heavy as the day before. There is a 100 percent chance of around 3.8 mm of rain during the Third Free Practice at 8 am (local time) and the Round 9 Qualifying at 10:20 am. But the good news is that no rain is predicted for the main Round 9 race, which will start at 3:05 pm (local time) and 11:35 am IST.Mitch Evans told RacingNews365.com that it was “very, very tricky” to race in wet conditions with the Hankook tyres in the recent races. He said, “In qualifying it was like, I was terrible. Nothing, you can't wake them [the tyres] up. In the race I was way more comfortable from the start, but the pace difference between me and some other guys was huge. So yeah, you can quickly be two, three seconds a lap slower.”Also Read: Tokyo E-Prix 2025: Schedule, timing and where to watch Round 8 and Round 9 Formula E races Nyck De Vries told the portal about racing in wet conditions, ""If it's wet, you're not even reaching full throttle.

All about the Tokyo Street Circuit

The ABB FIA Formula E World Championship returns to Tokyo for Rounds 8 and 9, as the Tokyo E-Prix double header prepares to electrify the city’s street circuit with cutting-edge Gen3 Evo cars this weekend. After making its debut last year, the Tokyo race is back—poised to raise the bar even higher this season. Here's everything you need to know about the circuit set in the heart of Japan’s bustling capital.Formula E’s official X account recently shared a graphic video representation of the Tokyo Street Circuit , offering fans a clear glimpse of the track layout to be used for the upcoming races. The video highlights key features such as the Attack Mode zone, the acceleration zone, and the overtaking zone.Winner Maximilian Guenther had said after winning the Tokyo race last year, “The track is phenomenal. It’s super technical and super challenging for us and the teams to set everything up properly. To get super close to the walls, you have to have good confidence in the car, and there’s even jumps that we have in a lap, so it’s a big mixture of everything! For me that is what Formula E is all about, to race so tight around these street circuits.”Jaguar TCS Racing driver Nick Cassidy, who earned the ABB Driver of Progress Award with 12 overtakes during the race, praised the track as well. Reflecting on his experience, he said, “It was a mega, a proper Formula E track. Bumps, fast corners, on the limit and you’ve really got to attack in qualifying. I thought the track was fantastic.”Set in the heart of Tokyo Bay , the 2.575km circuit features 18 turns and boasts a compact, technical layout that includes three long straights and three chicane sequences. The strategically placed Attack Mode activation zone, located just outside Turn 4, adds a critical tactical element to the race.Also Read: Tokyo E-Prix double header: Race favourites, circuit challenges and what to expect Meanwhile, the tight Turns 1 and 2, along with the demanding Turns 10 and 11, are expected to become prime overtaking opportunities. Adding yet another layer to Round 8, the introduction of the Pit Boost feature will bring significant strategic complexity that could influence the outcome for all 22 drivers.","The ABB FIA Formula E World Championship returns to Tokyo for Rounds 8 and 9.

NEW DELHI: As the clay court season reaches its big stage with Roland Garros , it once again reinforces the point in Indian tennis that the focus is on doubles and not singles. Leading the charge on that front is Yuki Bhambri , who was once the flag bearer in the singles department.The year, though, didn’t begin as Bhambri might have hoped. At the Australian Open, partnering Albano Olivetti, the duo bowed out in the first round.What has followed is a string of partner changes, not by design but by necessity, as Olivetti's injury and the volatile nature of the rankings forced Bhambri to adapt.His journey resumed with Croatian veteran Ivan Dodig at the ATP 250 in Montpellier. Since then, the Indian ace has had to recalibrate often. 2025 has so far witnessed Bhambri partnering with seven different players in 13 tournaments.Despite the instability, the results speak volumes. Bhambri (and Alexei Popyrin) clinched the ATP 500 title in Dubai, made it to the quarters at Indian Wells and Miami, and became India’s No. 1 in doubles last March, overtaking Rohan Bopanna , who had held that position since October 2019.Speaking to TimesofIndia.com before the Madrid Open, Bhambri acknowledged the highs and lows, ""I think it's part and parcel of our tennis, of rankings going up and down. I think tennis rewards you for consistency, and I've had good success over the last few months or so, which has just shown in the rankings.""But now comes another test, the clay. On the red dirt, Bhambri hasn't had the best results in the run-up to the French Open. Four of his last five clay appearances ended in first-round exits, with Robert Galloway being his regular companion in the latest tournaments.The 32-year-old, however, remains undeterred.""When you move on to clay, it's a lot slower. So you have to have a lot more patience. You have to be prepared to hit a lot of balls. You have to be prepared to slide on the court, find your footing, you know, be prepared for the bad bounces at times. So you're playing a very slow and patient game,"" he added.The only exception to Bhambri's clay troubles came in Bordeaux, partnering Galloway again. The pair fought in the ATP Challenger final but fell just short, losing 6-7(1), 6-7(2) to the fourth-seeded pairing of Francisco Cabral and Lucas Miedler.His dethroning of Bopanna ended a 286-week reign, coupled with a steady upward trend in his doubles rankings since the COVID-19 pandemic, signals nothing but sheer improvement.While Bhambri's stay at the top did not last long enough as the old warhorse Boppana has again occupied the India No.1 spot in the latest ATP doubles rankings, the New Delhi-born, who spends his days back in India mentoring kids at Roundglass Tennis Academy alongside his childhood coach Aditya Sachdeva, has grown more stubborn than ever.""I think the ultimate goal is to try and do better from here, to try and compete for more trophies. The French (Open) coming up, Wimbledon coming up soon in July, those would be the two key goals where I would really like to hopefully put my best foot forward and succeed,"" he noted.With Roland Garros just around the corner, the elements of something remarkable are there, but the big question remains: Can Bhambri, amid all the changes and challenges, find the right formula on clay? Indian tennis won’t have to wait long for an answer.",Yuki Bhambri is India's No.1 doubles player. The 32-year-old has had a string of partner changes this year. The Indian ace has had to recalibrate often on the red dirt.

Carlos Alcaraz won the Italian Open on Sunday after beating rival Jannik Sinner 7-6 (7/5), 6-1 in the final and firing a warning shot for Roland Garros .Alcaraz, who will climb to world number two behind Sinner on Monday, won his third title of the season ahead of the French Open which starts next weekend. The Spaniard claimed victory in his fourth final of the season and sent a message to the rest of the men's tour for Roland Garros where he will defend the title.Sinner tops the world rankings but his 26-match winning streak was ended by Alcaraz, also the man who had last beat him in last year's China Open final.Alcaraz is the only man to beat Sinner in a tour final since the start of 2024, when his Italian rival began his rise to the top of men's tennis and three Grand Slam titles.The 22-year-old has had a hugely impressive clay court swing this season even with the thigh injury which cost him the chance to compete at the Madrid Open.Alcaraz won in Rome a second Masters 1000 title of the year to go alongside his victory at Monte Carlo last month. He also reached the final in Barcelona.Finishing runner-up is still a hugely positive result for Sinner in his first tournament since his three-month ban for testing positive twice in March last year for traces of clostebol, a contamination doping authorities accepted was accidental.His progress in Rome also sets up the possibility of another final clash with Alcaraz at Roland Garros, with the two young stars of men's tennis set to be the two top seeds in Paris.Sinner was gunning to become the first Italian man to win at the Foro Italico since Adriano Panatta back in 1976, but he failed to make it a hat-trick of triumphs for home players in the Italian capital.Earlier Jasmine Paolini became the first woman since Monica Seles in 1990 to win the Rome singles and doubles titles when she and Sara Errani beat Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens 6-4, 7-5.Paolini secured that brace of victories a day after overcoming former US Open champion Coco Gauff in straight sets, and becoming the first Italian woman to win the Rome singles title since Raffaella Reggi in 1985.","Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner 7-6 (7/5), 6-1 in the Italian Open final.

NEW DELHI: In a remarkable victory at the Italian Open on Saturday, Jasmine Paolini secured her second 1000 series championship by defeating Coco Gauff 6-4, 6-2, setting a positive tone before Roland Garros this month.The achievement marks Paolini as the first Italian woman to secure the Rome tournament since Raffaella Reggi's victory in 1985, demonstrating her superiority over former US Open champion Gauff.The packed centre court at the Foro Italico witnessed Paolini's triumph, potentially the first of three titles that could be secured by Italian players in this year's Rome tournament.At 29, Paolini has become the oldest first-time Rome champion in the Open Era. Meanwhile, Gauff, who is eight years younger, missed the opportunity to become the youngest victor since Serena Williams' achievement in 2002.Gauff's performance was hindered by 55 unforced errors and seven double faults on serve, similar to her semi-final match against Zheng Qinwen, which simplified Paolini's path to victory.Paolini could achieve additional success in the women's doubles tournament, where she and Sara Errani face Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens in Sunday's final.The last woman to win both singles and doubles titles in Rome was Monica Seles in 1990, whilst Vera Zvonareva remains the sole player to accomplish this feat in a 1000 series tournament at Indian Wells in 2009.The tournament continues with Paolini's fellow Italian Jannik Sinner set to compete against Carlos Alcaraz in Sunday's men's singles final.","Jasmine Paolini defeated Coco Gauff 6-4, 6-2 in the Italian Open final.

Sinner bounces back

Jannik Sinner set up a blockbuster Italian Open final with Carlos Alcaraz by beating Tommy Paul 1-6, 6-0, 6-3 on Friday.World number one Sinner fought back from a set down in front of a packed crowd to continue his march towards a first title at the Foro Italico .After a strangely slow start, Sinner again showed good form on centre court where, since returning to action last week from a three-month doping ban, he has taken his unbeaten run to 26 matches.And the 23-year-old will face down Alcaraz, the last man to beat Sinner in the final at the China Open in early October, with all eyes on another potential final between the pair at the French Open next month.A win for Sinner against his rival would see the men's Rome title go to an Italian for the first time since Adriano Panatta in 1976.""If I want to win Sunday I have to play one of my best tennis for sure,"" said Sinner.""Carlos has played incredible tennis today, so let's see what's coming but from my side you know incredible to be here in the final.""Alcaraz booked his place in the showdown by beating Sinner's countryman Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 7-6 (7/4).The four-time Grand Slam champion overcame Musetti and the windy conditions in just over two hours to reach his fourth final of the season.""I'm going to have dinner, but my phone is going to be there watching (Sinner's) match,"" said Alcaraz after his win.""I have to know against who I'm going to play. I have to watch the match and see how they are going to play.""Musetti was beaten by Alcaraz in the Monte Carlo final last month and fell to his fifth straight defeat to the Spaniard after a frustrating display.And he believes that Alcaraz will have the better of it against Sinner if he brings his top form on Sunday evening.""I really rate Carlos. I think on clay that the best version of Carlos is favourite against anyone... that includes Jannik,"" he told reporters.Paul rattled off the first five games in 21 minutes in a near replica of what Sinner did to Casper Ruud on Thursday, closing out the first set in less than half an hour.The last time Sinner lost a set 6-1 was in the quarter-finals of the US Open against Daniil Medvedev, a match he won on his way to his second Grand Slam triumph.Sinner looked a shadow of the player who dominated tennis throughout 2024 right up to the start of his suspension, which was agreed with the World Anti-Doping Agency in early February.But from nowhere he came roaring back in the second set, finally forcing Paul back with some deep baseline shots of his own and his first aces of the match to win the second set to love and level the match.It was a complete role reversal with Paul now the one being thrown around the court, the world number 12 winning just 12 points in the second set and looking bewildered at how quickly the momentum shifted.Paul then handed Sinner the initiative with his second double fault of the night in game two of the third set. The Italian eventually won nine games in a row and marched on to victory.Earlier, Jasmine Paolini continued her bid to win the women's singles and doubles titles in Rome after reaching her second final of the week, this time alongside fellow Italian Sara Errani .Paolini and Errani, the reigning doubles champions, will meet Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens in the final on Sunday, before which Paolini could already be crowed singles champion.Late bloomer Paolini takes on Coco Gauff on Saturday aiming for her second 1000 series title at the age of 29 and to become the first Italian women to win in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985.","Jannik Sinner will play Carlos Alcaraz in the Italian Open final.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

Gauff joins Paolini

Jannik Sinner marched into the semi-finals of the Italian Open on Thursday after destroying Casper Ruud in straight sets 6-0, 6-1 as Coco Gauff won a marathon three-set battle with China's Zheng Qinwen to advance to the women's final.American Gauff will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's title match after pulling through 7-6 (7/3), 4-6, 7-6 (7/4) in a match that lasted over three-and-a-half hours.Ruud was supposed to be Sinner's toughest test in Rome since he came back from his three-month doping ban, as the Norwegian came into the match in hot form on clay after winning in Madrid earlier this month.In his previous matches Sinner looked to be still finding his feet after his suspension, accepted from the World Anti-Doping Agency for testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year.But the 23-year-old demolished sixth seed Ruud in just over an hour with an ominous display of tennis, his domination such that the home fans at the packed centre court, seemingly out of sympathy, began to cheer the rare points that Ruud won.""I was feeling great on court today. I think we all saw that,"" said Sinner.""How I felt today was very, very positive signs for me... I was serving well and also returning well. Moving great on the court, so I'm very happy about that.""Ruud even got the loudest celebration of the match when he held his serve for the only time, in game three of the second set, holding his arms aloft in ironic joy.""He was just everywhere... it's just like playing a wall that you know shoots hundred miles an hour balls at you all the time,"" said a bewildered Ruud.Tommy Paul, a 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 winner over Hubert Hurkacz in the day's first match, will have wondered what on earth he can do to stop Sinner if the Italian brings that form to Friday's last-four clash.Sinner won the first set in just 27 minutes, giving up only seven points as he stalked the court with intent, dressed all in black as he has been all week.And he then maintained his record of not dropping a set in the tournament to not so much stroll as smash into the last four, and send a message to Carlos Alcaraz.Spaniard Alcaraz, Sinner's key Grand Slam rival ahead of the French Open, will contest the other semi-final with Lorenzo Musetti on Friday afternoon, with the blockbuster final tennis fans wanted still on.Gauff prevailed on a centre court left mostly empty by fans who headed for the exits in large numbers after watching Sinner's tennis clinic.Former US Open winner Gauff won her third straight match against Olympic gold medallist Zheng, after coming through a tie in which she made 15 double faults on serve and there were a combined total of 156 unforced errors.The 21-year-old is looking for her first title of the season after losing the Madrid final to Sabalenka, and against home hope Paolini will find herself in a much fiercer atmosphere than the soporific crowd which stayed till past midnight to watch her reach her second final of the year.""I told myself I'm ready to go home,"" said an exhausted Gauff.""It was tough for me, finding my rhythm especially at night, it was so slow, I just tried to stay in there.""I was frustrated. She forced me to get out of my comfort zone.""Sixth seed Paolini is the third Italian woman to reach the Foro Italico final, and the first since her doubles partner Sara Errani was thumped by Serena Williams in 2014.Late bloomer Paolini, 29, will have a chance to be the first woman from the Mediterranean nation to win in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985, after beating Peyton Stearns 7-5, 6-1.""It's a privilege to be in this position. I matured late as a tennis player but everyone has their own path. Some mature earlier and some later,"" said Paolini.""I'm just enjoying it without thinking too much about the past.""Paolini could yet win both the singles and women's doubles tournaments, with her and Errani taking on Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider in the semi-finals on Friday.","Jannik Sinner thrashes Casper Ruud in straight sets 6-0, 6-1. Coco Gauff beats China's Zheng Qinwen to reach women's final. Gauff will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's title match. Tommy Paul beats Hubert Hurkacz in day's first match.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121200918,imgsize-24478,width-400,resizemode-4/Jannik-Sinner-Rome-AP.jpg"

Poll What do you think about Jannik Sinner's chances at the Italian Open? He will be eliminated early He will reach the finals He will win the title

Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner met with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican City on Wednesday during a break from the Italian Open , presenting the pontiff with a tennis racket and offering to play. The meeting came after the pope, known for his liking towards the sport, had earlier joked about not inviting Sinner, making a wordplay on the athlete's surname.The encounter took place in the Vatican's auditorium reception room, where Sinner arrived with his parents.""It's an honor,"" Sinner said in Italian as he presented the pope with a racket and ball, suggesting a quick volley.The 69-year-old American pope, who hails from Chicago, declined the offer to play, looking at the surrounding antiques and saying, ""Better not.""Leo XIV made a light-hearted comment about his white cassock being appropriate for Wimbledon, referencing the tournament's all-white dress code. The meeting included discussions about Sinner's progress in the Italian Open, where he faces a quarterfinal match on Thursday against Madrid champion Casper Ruud.Sinner is returning to competition after a three-month doping ban, which was determined to be due to accidental contamination.The Italian player is aiming to become the first from his country to claim the Rome title since Adriano Panatta's victory in 1976.During the interaction, Italian Tennis and Padel Federation head Angelo Binaghi presented the pope with an honorary federation card. ""We all felt the passion that Leo XIV has for our sport and this filled us with pride,"" Binaghi stated. ""We hope to embrace the Holy Father again soon, maybe on a tennis court.""The meeting included a photo session featuring the Davis Cup trophy, which Sinner helped Italy secure for the second consecutive year. The Billie Jean King Cup trophy, won by Italy in 2024, was also displayed during the meeting.Earlier in the week, Sinner had responded positively to the pope's initial joke, noting it was ""a good thing for us tennis players"" to have a pope who enjoys the sport.Beyond tennis, Pope Leo XIV is known to be a devoted Chicago White Sox baseball fan, following in the tradition of his predecessor, Pope Francis, who supported the Buenos Aires football club San Lorenzo.","Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner met with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican City on Wednesday during a break from the Italian Open.

Carlos Alcaraz made a triumphant return following his injury recovery, defeating Serbian qualifier Dusan Lajovic 6-3, 6-3 at the Italian Open on Friday.The world number three had previously pulled out of the Madrid Open, citing an upper right leg issue that impacted his performance in the Barcelona Open final, along with a left leg concern.Alcaraz competed against Lajovic whilst wearing a black support that covered his upper right leg, extending just below his knee.""The body felt great,"" Alcaraz said. ""I just moved well. I made a few good sprints today without any pain. ... It was a test for me so I think I passed the test today.""""It was a great performance, great level, which was surprising for me a little bit, but just really happy for that,"" Alcaraz added.After winning the initial four games, Alcaraz lost his serve while attempting to finish the first set at 5-2. He regained control by breaking back, showcasing his court abilities at the Foro Italico with an impressive backhand winner following a drop shot.The second set progressed similarly, with Alcaraz establishing an early advantage.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

Jannik Sinner will delight crowds at the Rome Open this week when the world number one makes his return to tennis, but the Italian's three-month doping ban has allowed other local rising stars to move into the limelight.Sinner was on Monday joined in the top 10 of the men's world rankings by Lorenzo Musetti , who is at number nine after reaching the Monte Carlo final and the last four in Madrid.Meanwhile Luciano Darderi and Flavio Cobolli won tournaments in Marrakesh and Bucharest in April, further underlining the strength in depth that Italian tennis has behind Sinner, a three-time Grand Slam winner.Filippo Volandri , captain of the Italy team which has won the last two editions of the Davis Cup, told AFP that ""Italian tennis is clearly in a golden age"".""But it's been a long time coming, we're seeing the fruits of work which was started some time ago,"" he added.Volandri, who has been in charge of top-level male players for the Italian Tennis Federation (FITP) for the last nine years, showed AFP a graphic which illustrates Italy's recent progress.Between 2005 and 2015 Italian players won eight ATP titles -- with seven of those in the lowest 250 category -- but since 2016 the tally of tournament wins has more than trebled to 31.Five of those 31 wins have come in top-level Master 1000 tournaments, with another three being Sinner's Grand Slam triumphs. Sinner is responsible in total for 19 of Italy's ATP wins since 2016.""Jannik is the product of a movement which had already given us Matteo Berrettini reaching the Wimbledon final (in 2021). He is the result of a system that works,"" said Volandri.Michelangelo Dell'Edera, the director of the FITP's Higher Training Institute, told AFP that the federation runs a geographically-decentralised system which was put in place at the end of the 1990s.""Every province has a coach from the federation for children between 8-10 years old, while each region has a manager in charge of players between the ages of 11 and 16,"" explained Dell'Edera.Players were for a long time obliged to move to the national training centre at Tirrenia, just up the Tuscany coast from Livorno, but that is no longer the case.""Decentralisation means making our skills available to young players and their coaches,"" said Volandri.""We're reaching out to them rather than tearing them away from their families and their lives.""Dell'Edera said the renaissance in Italian tennis has also come via a change in training philosophy and playing style.""To make a comparison with another sport, we've gone from the marathon, where players were slugging forehands and backhands, to the 100m, a sort of 'speed tennis' where the emphasis is on the serve and return, two shots which determine whether a point can be won,"" he said.Every year for the past seven years, just before the Rome Open the FITP invites its 12,000 coaches to a seminar at the picturesque Foro Italico where the major clay court tournament is played.The seminar is held to discuss training, physical preparation and tactics, with guest appearances from big foreign names in the field such as Emilio Sanchez and Brad Gilbert, who were there on Saturday.Gilbert, the former coach of tennis icon Andre Agassi, is impressed with the work being done in Italy.""They're getting to the top, they have Sinner. Sometimes you get to the top and you rest. If anything, they are spending more,"" said Gilbert.""They've made an incredible commitment and they've got a great supporting team. Sinner is the reward.""But they started this thing 10, 15 years ago and they're still producing. I just watched this kid... Federico Cina. He is special.""Cina could have the chance to show how special he is as he will play Sinner in the second round in Rome if he gets past Argentinian Mariano Navone in his opening match.","Italian tennis is in a golden age, according to captain Filippo Volandri. Jannik Sinner will return to action at the Rome Open this week after a three-month doping ban. Lorenzo Musetti and Luciano Darderi are also in the top 10 of the world rankings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120924340,imgsize-23878,width-400,resizemode-4/Jannik-Sinner-Rome-AP.jpg"

Casper Ruud secured his first Masters 1000 title at the Madrid Open on Sunday, defeating Jack Draper in a hard-fought final that lasted two and a half hours with a score of 7-5, 3-6, 6-4. The Norwegian, who had previously been a three-time Grand Slam runner-up, finally claimed victory in his seventh major final at the Manolo Santana stadium.Draper, who will rise to fifth in the world rankings above Novak Djokovic on Monday, was unable to add to his Indian Wells triumph from March.""This was my seventh big final if you count them all, so seven is a lucky number, I guess. So it was worth the wait in the end. I've never really been too close in any of the finals when I look back -- I've lost the majority of them in straight sets,"" Ruud said.The victory marked a significant milestone for Ruud, who had previously struggled in major finals, including a loss to Djokovic in the 2022 ATP Finals.""It is a mix somewhat of a relief and happiness and just pure joy. I know, based on the last years that I've had on tour, how tough it is to do well at the biggest tournaments, and I've never been able to get over the finish line as a champion, but today I was able to,"" Ruud explained.Draper, seeking his first clay court title, acknowledged Ruud's superior performance in crucial moments.""Congratulations to Casper on this win, you really deserve it -- you were braver than me in the key moments. This sport is brutal but I will keep trying, I think this loss will make me better,"" Draper said.The match began with Draper taking an early lead, breaking Ruud's serve for a 2-1 advantage in the first set. However, Ruud fought back to level the set at 5-5 before claiming it as Draper mishit a forehand.Draper dominated the second set, making just one unforced error and successfully breaking Ruud twice to force a deciding set.The final set saw intense competition, with Ruud breaking in the fifth game and consolidating for a 4-2 lead. Despite Draper's resistance and a late surge, Ruud secured the victory on his first match point.The 26-year-old Ruud, ranked 15th, added this Masters 1000 title to his collection of 12 ATP titles at 250 and 500 level.Draper remained optimistic about his future prospects despite the loss.""I honestly feel like I'm at the start of my journey. I'm going to keep on improving and keep on pushing hard and keep these sort of tough moments in my head to keep on driving myself to be better,"" he said.","Casper Ruud beats Jack Draper 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 in Madrid Open final. It is Ruud's first Masters 1000 title. Draper will rise to fifth in the world rankings above Novak Djokovic on Monday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120885402,imgsize-28726,width-400,resizemode-4/Casper-Ruud-Madrid-Open-AP.jpg"

Former England batter Ravi Bopara has weighed in on the India-Pakistan rivalry, saying that while the clash remains cricket’s fiercest contest emotionally, the gap in skill and mindset between the two sides has become too big to ignore.According to Bopara, India no longer see Pakistan as their biggest cricketing threat. Instead, England, Australia, South Africa, and even New Zealand occupy higher positions on their radar.“I don’t think India see Pakistan as a major threat. They might see England as a major threat. They might see Australia or New Zealand or South Africa. Pakistan will be at the bottom of that list,” Bopara said in a podcast ""Beard Before Wicket.""He believes the contrasting conversations in the two dressing rooms sum up the gulf between the sides.“The rivalry will be right at the top of the list, but in terms of cricketing quality, it’s different. I’m pretty sure in India’s dressing room, the talk is something like: ‘Let’s not take them too lightly today, let’s make sure we bury them.’""In Pakistan’s dressing room, it’s probably more like: ‘Hey, one of us has to have a day out today and we’ll win.’”Bopara stressed that Pakistan rely too heavily on individual brilliance rather than a collective plan.“They don’t think they’re going to out-skill India. They just hope that if someone like Fakhar Zaman has a big day, that might be enough. But India’s mindset is completely different,” he added.Despite acknowledging the passion for cricket in Pakistan and the talent emerging through the Pakistan Super League PSL ), Bopara said the national team has been stuck in a prolonged “transition phase.”“It’s been going on for a very long time, actually. A very long time. But PSL has produced good players. I’ve watched guys like Shaheen Shah Afridi since he first came on the scene for Peshawar Zalmi, and they’ve improved a lot. The talent is there, but maybe it’s a discipline issue,” he noted.Bopara underlined that while Pakistan remain Asia’s second-best side, the inability to “get it together” consistently has kept them from challenging India.","Ravi Bopara says India no longer see Pakistan as their biggest cricketing threat.

A Father's Pride: How RR, Dravid & Vikram Shaped Vaibhav Suryavanshi

Vaibhav Suryavanshi is turning heads again, this time on Australian soil. The 14-year-old prodigy smashed a brilliant century in the first Youth Test against Australia U-19, reaching 100 in just 78 balls and finishing with 113 off 86 balls. His innings featured nine fours and eight sixes, and he shared a solid 152-run partnership with Vedant Trivedi. Captain Ayush Mhatre was dismissed for 21, while Vihaan Malhotra fell for 6. Vaibhav’s innings came to an end when he was caught by Alex Lee Young off Hayden Schiller’s bowling.The young Indian star has already made a name for himself across formats. In the Youth ODI series, he broke the record for the most career sixes in Youth ODI cricket, surpassing Unmukt Chand’s previous mark of 38 maximums during India’s second 50-over clash against Australia at the Ian Healy Oval in Brisbane.Vaibhav first drew attention in domestic cricket during the 2023-24 Ranji Trophy season, making his first-class debut at just 12 years and 284 days against Mumbai, becoming the youngest player in the tournament’s history. His rise continued when he became the youngest player to earn an IPL contract, signed by Rajasthan Royals in the IPL 2025 auction at the age of 13.In the IPL, Vaibhav lit up the tournament with a sensational 38-ball 101, smashing records along the way. His 35-ball century is the second-fastest in IPL history, after Chris Gayle’s 30-ball blitz for RCB in 2013, and the fastest by an Indian. From domestic cricket to international youth tests and the IPL, Vaibhav Suryavanshi continues to rewrite the record books, proving that age is no barrier to greatness.",Vaibhav Suryavanshi smashed 113 in the first Youth Test against Australia U-19.

Abhishek Sharma trolls Shaheen Afridi, smashes Pakistan bowlers and dominates

Poll Do you support Suryakumar Yadav's gesture of donating his match fees to the Indian Army? Yes, absolutely! No, it's controversial.

India clinched their second T20 Asia Cup crown with a nail-biting five-wicket win over Pakistan in the 2025 final on Sunday, but the action on the field was only half the story. The post-match statements from both teams took as much spotlight as the cricket itself.Before the final, former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi and Muhammad Yunus had said the team would dedicate the Asia Cup trophy to the Pakistan Air Force if they managed to win. Afridi even revealed that he had personally reached out to players with this suggestion, hoping to inspire them for the big clash.However, it was India who walked away with the title. Chasing 147 after dismissing Pakistan for 146, Suryakumar Yadav’s side got home with two balls to spare. Tilak Varma stood tall with a composed unbeaten 69, supported by Shivam Dube’s 33, ensuring India sealed the contest.This was India’s third win over Pakistan in the tournament, having already beaten them in the league stage and the Super Fours.In the post-match press conference however, it was India captain Suryakumar Yadav that donated his match fees to the Indian Army. “As a gesture, I want to donate my match fees from all the games in this tournament to the Indian Army.I don’t know if people will call it controversial, but for me, it’s the right thing to do,” he said, before exiting.Also read: 'Senseless Pakistan' – Shoaib Akhtar’s emotional outburst after Asia Cup final defeat Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha followed suit in his own way. “We as a team, are donating our match fees to all the civilians who lost their lives during the Indian attack and to our kids who were affected by it.

‘They complement each other perfectly,’ Suryakumar Kumar on Abhishek Sharma-Shubman Gill stand vs Pakistan

Former Indian cricket captain Kris Srikkanth has expressed serious concerns about current T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav 's batting performance following India's Asia Cup victory. Despite leading India to triumph in the continental tournament, Suryakumar's batting form has been a significant issue, scoring only 72 runs throughout the competition and facing criticism for his consistent low scores.Suryakumar Yadav's recent batting statistics paint a concerning picture. In 2025, as India's T20I captain, he has managed only 100 runs in 11 innings, maintaining an average just above nine. His overall performance as captain shows 330 runs in 20 innings, highlighting an extended period of batting struggles.The Asia Cup tournament particularly highlighted these concerns, with Suryakumar recording a series of low scores - 0, 5, 12, and 1 in his last four matches. In the final match, chasing a target of 147 runs, he was dismissed for just 1 run, putting additional pressure on the team.""Suryakumar Yadav let me down. His scores are like a pin code these days. Both batting lineups had several pin codes, with Pakistan being much worse, of course. But yes, Surya's form is very concerning, along with Shubman Gill ,"" Srikkanth said on his YouTube channel.Srikkanth's critique extended to vice-captain Shubman Gill's performance in the T20 format as well.""Shubman Gill doesn't look very deadly in the T20 format. He is fantastic in Tests and ODIs. Though they made him the vice-captain, with the World Cup coming up, we have to see what they do with him. He wasn't even in my team during the initial selection. But they made him the vice-captain as well,"" he added.The 1983 World Cup winner's concerns go beyond individual performances, extending to the overall team composition for the upcoming T20 World Cup. His assessment suggests that while the current lineup might suffice against lesser opposition, it could face significant challenges against stronger teams.""This team is not the right one for the T20 World Cup. It was enough for the below average sides in this tournament. But if we play with this team in the T20 World Cup, it'll be curtains for us,"" said Srikkanth.The statistics from the Asia Cup underline these concerns. Suryakumar's highest score in the tournament came against Pakistan in the group stage, where he managed 47 runs. This was his only innings crossing the 20-run mark throughout the competition.The criticism comes at a crucial time as India prepares for future international competitions. The team's performance in the Asia Cup, while resulting in victory, has raised questions about the batting lineup's effectiveness, particularly in the context of more challenging tournaments ahead.These developments have sparked discussions about potential team composition changes and strategies as India looks toward upcoming international cricket commitments, particularly the T20 World Cup where they will face more formidable opponents.","Former Indian captain Kris Srikkanth has expressed serious concerns about current T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav's batting performance following India's Asia Cup victory.

India’s thrilling five-wicket win over Pakistan in the Asia Cup 2025 final brought jubilation to the team and fans alike, but the celebrations took an unusual turn. With the trophy withheld by Asian Cricket Council president and Pakistan minister Mohsin Naqvi, India’s champions had no silverware to lift. Tilak Varma, however, found a creative way to mark the victory.After returning home, Tilak shared a playful post on Instagram, writing, “Bringing the trophy back to my childhood friends, this one’s for us.” In the video, he celebrated in the style of Rohit Sharma , mimicking the iconic walk from India’s 2024 T20 World Cup triumph, albeit with an imaginary trophy and surrounded by friends. The gesture captured the joy of the moment despite the absence of the official cup.Click here to watch the video After the Asia Cup final, Mohsin Naqvi, ignoring protocol and common sense, insisted on presenting the trophy himself. When India refused, he arrogantly ordered the trophy and medals removed from the stadium and stormed out, leaving players and fans in confusion and spoiling what should have been a celebratory moment.The final itself was a roller-coaster ride. Pakistan got off to a great start, with Sahibzada Farhan bringing up another half-century. From 113 for 1, however, they suffered a monumental collapse thanks to Kuldeep Yadav ’s inspired spell, losing their last nine wickets for only 33 runs.At 107 for 1 after 12 overs, Pakistan seemed in control, but Kuldeep kept striking regularly, including taking three wickets in a single over. The Pakistan innings fell apart in the final five overs, leaving them at 146 all out in 19.1 overs.India’s chase began shakily. In-form Abhishek Sharma fell early, followed soon by Suryakumar Yadav and Shubman Gill. Tilak Varma came to the crease and played a calculated, unbeaten 69, building crucial fifty-run partnerships with Sanju Samson and Shivam Dube.

India vs Pakistan breaks out between journalists in Dubai during Salman Agha press conference

Former Pakistan batsman Ahmed Shehzad has raised serious concerns about Salman Ali Agha’s appointment as Pakistan’s T20I captain, questioning his suitability for the format. Shehzad highlighted Agha’s struggles during the 2025 Asia Cup, where he managed just 72 runs in seven matches at an average of 12 and a strike rate of 80.89. His performance drew criticism as Pakistan lost to India in the final by five wickets.“Salman Ali Agha is a good player, but it is difficult for him to make a place in T20 cricket, yet he has been made the captain,” Shehzad stated during a television appearance. His comments reflect a growing debate within Pakistan cricket circles about whether leadership responsibilities have been placed on a player who has not consistently excelled in the shortest format.Despite his struggles, Salman Ali Agha continues to be part of Pakistan’s cricket setup across formats, maintaining his place in both the shorter and longer versions of the game. His appointment as T20I captain came following Mohammad Rizwan’s replacement during the tri-series against UAE and Afghanistan and the subsequent Asia Cup, but recent results have raised questions about the decision.Adding to Pakistan cricket’s turmoil, Mohsin Naqvi, who holds dual positions as Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board and Interior Minister, has come under intense scrutiny. Critics, including Shahid Afridi , have urged Naqvi to relinquish one of his roles, arguing that both positions require dedicated focus.Following Pakistan’s Asia Cup campaign, where India defeated them in all three encounters, concerns over the board’s leadership and vision have intensified. Afridi emphasized the need for competent advisers who understand the game, noting that Naqvi’s current team of advisers has been ineffective.The combined issues of leadership at both the player and administrative levels have sparked widespread debate. Pakistan cricket now faces pressure to reassess its captaincy choices and the board’s management approach as it prepares for upcoming international commitments.",Former Pakistan batsman Ahmed Shehzad has raised serious concerns about Salman Ali Agha's appointment as Pakistan’s T20I captain.

GUWAHATI: Deepti Sharma starred with an all-round show as India recovered from a middle order collapse to first set Sri Lanka a 271-run target and then skittle the Islanders to 211 with eight balls to spare for a 59-run win in their 2025 ICC Women’s ODI World Cup opener here at Barsapara Cricket Stadium on Tuesday.Sri Lanka had a steady start to their chase as they raced to 80 runs in the 15th over losing opener Hasini Perera to young pacer Kranti Gaud. However, it was Sharma who castled a dangerous-looking Sri Lanka captain Chamari Athapaththu (43 off 47 balls) in the last ball of the 15th over to put the brakes on. She later accounted for Kavisha Dilhari (15) and Anushka Sanjeewani (6) to complete her match figures with 3/54 from 10 overs.Sharma got able support from her tweak colleagues Sneh Rana (2/32) and Shree Charani (2/37) in the middle overs as together they tightened the noose around the Islanders’ chase with seven wickets among them. Medium pacer Amanjot Kaur and Pratika Rawal took a wicket apiece.No. 6 Nilakshika da Silva tried to break the shackles with a 29-ball 35 — studded four boundaries and a maximum — but Rana dismantled her stumps to virtually end Sri Lanka’s hopes of pulling off a memorable win.Earlier, the weather and the course of first innings were both stop-start affairs. However, neither proved a complete spoilsport.Indian innings swayed from a steady start to a middle-over collapse and finally ended with a flourish. Amanjot (57 off 56 balls) and Sharma (53 off 53 balls) shared a 103-run stand for the seventh wicket with some late fireworks from Rana (28 off 15) helping India post 269/8 from 47 overs after Sri Lanka opted to bowl first.Rana played a vital cameo with two fours and as many sixes to take India past the 250-run mark, which looked far off at one point. India’s final score was adjusted to 270 as per the DLS method.It drizzled thrice during the first innings. Twice the rain stopped the proceedings. First, a one-and-a-half-hour stoppage after India reached 43/1 in 10 overs and then a brief eight-minute interruption at the end of 40th over. A passing shower in the 43rd over finally didn’t impede the play but the match was reduced to a 47-over-per-side affair.In-form Smriti Mandhana departed trying to clear the off-side early on in the powerplay but ended up slicing it to deep cover.Harleen Deol joined opener Pratika Rawal to steady the ship with a 67-run stand for the second wicket. Rawal departed to Inoka Ranaweera holing out at deep mid-wicket but it was Deol’s soft dismissal to the left-arm Lankan spinner which sparked a middle order collapse as the Indians went down from 120/2 to 124/6 in two overs.Ranaweera returned Deol, Jemimah Rodrigues and India captain Harmanpreet Kaur in the 26th over and was on a hat-trick as Rodrigues departed with a golden duck. Next over, captain Athapaththu scalped Richa Ghosh as the wicketkeeper-batter returned an easy catch to cover point.As the Indian innings looked to implode against the Islanders, Sharma and Kaur held fort with aplomb. They scored at more than run a ball as the Sri Lankans let go an opportunity of finishing the Indian innings to a below-par score with sloppy bowling and fielding. Without taking away anything from Amanjot, she was given three lives by the Lankans.Record attendance: The official attendance of 22,843 on Sunday was a record at any league match of an ICC Women’s World Cup game, breaking the attendance of 15935 set at the 2024 T20 World Cup game between India and Pakistan in Dubai.","The official attendance of 22,843 on Sunday was a record at any league match of an ICC Women’s World Cup game, breaking the attendance of 15935 set at the 2024 T20 World Cup in Dubai.

Poll What was the highlight of Tilak Varma's performance in the final? His unbeaten 69 runs Maintaining composure under pressure Building partnerships Celebrations after the win

India’s Asia Cup 2025 final hero Tilak Varma paid a visit to Telangana Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy on Tuesday, where he was felicitated for his match-winning performance against Pakistan in Dubai.Reddy praised Tilak's efforts and posed with a cricket bat presented by the young batter, mimicking a shot on the pitch. State Sports Minister Vakiti Srihari and several sports officials were also present during the ceremony.Earlier, speaking to reporters, Varma looked back on his heroics in the high-pressure final. The 22-year-old admitted he had to remain calm under intense pressure, reminding himself that he was batting not just for himself but for the 140 crore people back home.“There was a lot of pressure and nerves in my body. A lot was going on in my mind. In my mind and heart, I thought that whatever I do, I will give my life for the country. If I am under pressure and fail, I am not just bringing myself down, I am bringing down 140 crore people. To do that, I had to stay calm. I have learnt the basics from my childhood, and I have had this habit since I was a kid — to be calm and execute everything in my mind,” Varma said.In the final, India lost key top-order batters Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill, and Suryakumar Yadav early, leaving the team in a tough position. Tilak rose to the occasion, striking an unbeaten 69 to guide India to a five-wicket win and secure their ninth Asia Cup title.Tilak also credited partnerships for India’s recovery, highlighting his stand with Shivam Dube. “The wicket was not that easy for batting. As soon as we came back, we won the game by building a partnership. That is the quality of India,” he said.He also spoke about the distractions during the India–Pakistan clash, saying, “Pakistan always tries to distract the players. A lot of things happened when I was batting, but I can’t tell you on camera. It happens in India-Pakistan matches — we say a lot of things in the middle of the game. But the real answer is when you win the match. That’s what I had to do, and I did it.”The young batter and his post-match celebrations, pumping his fists and passionately shouting after Rinku Singh hit the winning four had immediately went viral after the final.",Tilak Varma met Telangana CM Revanth Reddy after he guided India to the Asia Cup 2025 trophy in Dubai.

Yamal's return

Lamine Yamal returned from injury to help Barcelona beat Real Sociedad 2-1 on Sunday and move top of La Liga by one point.After Real Madrid were thrashed 5-2 by rivals Atletico Madrid in a derby on Saturday, Hansi Flick's side had the chance to claim pole position above Xabi Alonso's side.Alvaro Odriozola gave Real Sociedad the lead against the run of play in the first half but Jules Kounde headed the Spanish champions level.Yamal, who missed the last four games with a groin injury, created the winner for Robert Lewandowski just moments after coming on as a second-half substitute.""I'm very happy for (Yamal), very pleased that he's back on the pitch because we're going to need him,"" Kounde told Movistar.""He showed directly the outstanding strength he has to create chances, to give that last pass,"" said Flick.Barcelona held the game at the Olympic stadium, where they have played for the last two seasons, after the city council refused them a permit to reopen their Camp Nou home earlier in the week.Flick handed 17-year-old attacking midfielder Dro Fernandez his debut, also starting Roony Bardghji on the right wing and bringing in veteran Wojciech Szczesny for injured goalkeeper Joan Garcia.Barcelona dominated the ball in the first half but found it hard to beat Real Sociedad goalkeeper Alex Remiro.The Spain international made a fine save to deny Marcus Rashford in the early stages.On loan from Manchester United, Rashford is finding his footing at Barca and played a superb through ball for Lewandowski, who fired across the face of goal from a tight angle.Real Sociedad hit Barca with a sharp counter-attack to open the scoring after 31 minutes.Former Real Madrid defender Odriozola applied the finishing touch to Ander Barrenetxea's cross.Barcelona stepped up a gear and found the equaliser from a corner before the break.Rashford, who provided an assist from another corner against Real Oviedo in midweek, whipped it to the near post, where Kounde powered home a header.Flick replaced Dro with Dani Olmo at half-time and also brought on Yamal before the hour mark, after the teenager recovered from his groin issue.Voted the second best player in the world at the Ballon d'Or gala on Monday, Yamal made an instant impact.The 18-year-old burst into the box and crossed for Lewandowski to head home off the post, just over a minute after his introduction.""His presence on the pitch is a threat,"" said Real Sociedad coach Sergio Francisco.""Even putting on fresh players against him (doesn't work)... he's showing he's the best player in the world.""Szczesny made a good save from Oyarzabal as La Real gave Barcelona a couple of scares, while Remiro denied Rashford and Olmo with two more good saves.The game grew increasingly chaotic and both sides hit the crossbar in quick succession.Kounde, daydreaming in midfield, was robbed and Real Sociedad worked the ball to Takefusa Kubo, who crashed a shot against the woodwork.Then Barcelona broke away and Ferran Torres teed up Lewandowski, who battered the crossbar when well placed to put the game to bed, but the hosts were not punished.""It was a difficult game, I didn't like our last 25 minutes, we suffered too much,"" added Kounde.""The first 70 minutes I think were quite good, we could have scored more than two... but I didn't like how it ended.""Barcelona host Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Wednesday, also at the Olympic stadium.Real Sociedad have had a tough start to the season, sitting 17th, but have been improving and will take heart from the pressure they put Barca under.""Despite the defeat I'm proud of the team's work,"" said Odriozola.

The victory came amid internal tensions, with manager Unai Emery recently criticizing his players and sporting director Monchi departing the club.John McGinn's strike in the 13th minute proved decisive for Villa. The Scotland international found the bottom corner with a shot from the edge of the area.Ollie Watkins, who started on the bench due to his goalless run this season, missed a penalty in the second half with Łukasz Skorupski making an easy save.Bologna came close to equalizing when Santiago Castro's header hit the crossbar, but Villa managed to hold on for the win, repeating their success against the Italian side from their previous Champions League encounter.""Important to get a win at home after not our strongest start to the season,"" McGinn said. ""We haven't been good enough. We've had a lot of praise the past couple of seasons and we're rightly being criticised at the minute.""Rangers' situation worsened as they played with ten men after Mohamed Diomande's red card before halftime for a dangerous challenge.Former Celtic striker Oh Hyeon-Gyu missed a penalty for Genk in first-half stoppage time but redeemed himself by scoring the winning goal ten minutes into the second half.Martin, who joined Rangers in June, has now gone eight games without a win in both Scottish Premiership and European competitions.In other Europa League matches, Lille secured a 2-1 victory over Norwegian side Brann with Olivier Giroud scoring the winner.American player Tanner Tessmann helped Lyon defeat Utrecht 1-0.Stuttgart emerged victorious with a 2-1 win over Celta Vigo.Porto claimed a 1-0 away victory against RB Salzburg.","Aston Villa secured their first win of the season with a 1-0 victory over Bologna.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

WATCH:

Coco Gauff staged a remarkable comeback to beat Belinda Bencic 4-6, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in a tense China Open round of 16 clash on Tuesday, a match remembered as much for a fiery on-court outburst as for elite-level tennis.The drama unfolded during a changeover in the second set, with Bencic accusing Gauff’s team of deliberately disrupting her focus.“When I’m going to the line ready to serve, they don’t need to cheer,” the Swiss star complained to the chair umpire. The 25-year-old continued, snapping at Gauff herself: “No one’s talking to you. She’s talking to me, okay! I’m too old for these mind games!”Gauff, just a few feet away, tried to interject, but Bencic’s sharp rebuke dominated the confrontation. The tense exchange was captured in a video that quickly went viral, illustrating the psychological intensity of elite tennis.The incident appeared to affect Bencic more than Gauff. After dropping the first set and trailing in the second, Gauff regrouped, winning a tight tiebreak as Bencic double-faulted on set point and hurled her racquet in frustration. The American teenager carried that momentum into the decider, breaking early and racing to a 6-2 victory.“It was a tough match,” Gauff said post-game. “I had chances in the first to close it out, but I’m happy with how I fought. She was really aggressive.”The win not only secured Gauff a spot in the China Open quarter-finals but also confirmed her qualification for the WTA Finals in Riyadh this November. She will next face either Germany’s Eva Lys or fellow American McCartney Kessler.","Coco Gauff beats Belinda Bencic 4-6, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in China Open round of 16 clash.

Poll Which of Nikola Pilic's achievements do you find most impressive? Leading three countries to Davis Cup titles Training multiple Grand Slam champions His own professional tennis achievements All of the above

Croatian tennis legend Nikola Pilic, the pioneering coach who trained Novak Djokovic and the only captain to lead three countries to Davis Cup glory, has died at the age of 86, the Croatian Tennis Association announced on Tuesday. Pilic passed away on Monday in the western Croatian town of Opatija.Born in Split in 1939, Pilic began representing the Yugoslav youth national team just four years after starting tennis. He went on to dominate national competitions, winning five Yugoslav singles titles, seven doubles crowns, and one mixed doubles championship. His greatest achievement on the court came in 1973 when he finished runner-up at the French Open to Ilie Nastase. He also claimed the US Open doubles title in 1970 alongside Pierre Barthes.Pilic was already a prominent figure when tennis turned professional in 1968, becoming one of the first eight men, dubbed the “Handsome Eight,” to sign with Lamar Hunt’s World Championship Tennis tour. He reached a career-high singles ranking of No. 6 and won nine singles titles along the way.Off the court, Pilic’s influence was even greater. After retiring in 1978, he enjoyed a distinguished coaching career, leading Germany to Davis Cup triumphs in 1988, 1989, and 1993, guiding Croatia to victory in 2005, and serving as an adviser when Serbia won in 2010.His academy near Munich nurtured future stars including Michael Stich, Goran Ivanisevic, and Novak Djokovic, who affectionately called Pilic his “tennis dad.” In 1999, Djokovic’s first coach Jelena Gencic sent the young player to train under Pilic, shaping the foundation for his 24 Grand Slam titles.“Nikola Niki Pilic will be remembered as the only captain ever to lead three different nations to Davis Cup titles,” the Croatian Tennis Association said. His contributions were recognised with a Lifetime Achievement Award from Croatia in 2019 and Serbia’s Gold Medal of Merit in 2020.",Croatian tennis legend Nikola Pilic has died at the age of 86.

Taylor Fritz held off Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to seal Team World's triumph in the Laver Cup on Sunday as two wins for Carlos Alcaraz on the final day proved too little for Team Europe.Fritz fired a backhand volley winner on his first match point to give Team World a 15-9 victory over Europe in the global tennis event, sparking jubilant celebrations from his teammates and World captain Andre Agassi at Chase Center -- home of the NBA's Golden State Warriors.""The energy from the team, it just feels the moments of winning feel so much better, the moments of losing feel so much worse because you're doing it for all these guys,"" Fritz said.""It just fires me up so much,"" added the fifth-ranked American, who had beaten Alcaraz on Saturday when Team World swept all four matches to seize a 9-3 lead.Fritz had raced through the opening set against a weary-looking Zverev.The German stepped it up in the second set, but he was down a break and trailing 4-3 before he finally mustered his first break points of the night.He converted his third to level the set at 4-4 to the delight of his Europe teammates and captain Yannick Noah.A quick hold from Zverev left Fritz serving to stay in the set.He held to love and they battled to the tiebreaker, where Fritz took a 3-0 lead only for Zverev to win three straight points before Fritz won four of the final five.Alcaraz, fresh off his sixth Grand Slam title at the US Open, had kept Europe's title defense alive with a blistering 6-2, 6-1 victory over Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo.Alcaraz and Casper Ruud had sliced Europe's deficit with a 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 doubles victory over Reilly Opelka and Alex Michelsen to open Sunday's action.But Australian world number eight Alex De Minaur then beat Czech Jakub Mensik 6-3, 6-4 to push Team World's lead to 12-6, with 13 points needed to claim the Cup and each match on Sunday worth three points.De Minaur, a late replacement on Team World for Frances Tiafoe, had nabbed two wins on Saturday -- beating Zverev in singles and coming through again in doubles.Team World regained the title they surrendered to Europe last year in Berlin.Europe have won five of eight editions of the event co-created by Swiss great Roger Federer , which will be held in London next year.Ruud def.

Former captain Rashid Latif on Pakistan boycotting India T20 World Cup match

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s decision to boycott their Group A match against India at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 has shifted the focus to how such a situation is handled under ICC playing conditions and what India must do to secure a walkover.The boycott was announced through a social media post by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which stated that while the Pakistan team has been granted permission to participate in the tournament, it “shall not take the field” for the match scheduled against India on February 15 in Colombo. Pakistan’s players, who remain cleared to play the rest of the World Cup, learned of the decision through the same government communication.Under ICC playing conditions, a walkover is not granted simply because a team announces it will not play. For a match to be officially forfeited, one side must fail to present itself at the venue at the appointed time for the coin toss. Until that point, the fixture is treated as going ahead as scheduled.As a result, India are required to follow all match-day procedures. India captain Suryakumar Yadav is expected to arrive at the ground on time and walk out for the toss at the scheduled hour.If Pakistan do not appear for the toss, the match referee will formally award India a walkover, which carries two points in the group standings.India’s preparations will therefore mirror those for a normal fixture. Only the match referee has the authority to call off the game and confirm the walkover.The ICC, meanwhile, has acknowledged the Pakistani government’s statement but said it is still awaiting official communication from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). In its response, the ICC noted that selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the principles of global tournaments, which are built on fairness, consistency and sporting integrity. It also warned that such a move could have wider implications for Pakistan cricket.Despite those concerns, the immediate process remains procedural rather than political. Unless Pakistan’s position changes before match day, the outcome will hinge on a single moment — whether their team appears for the toss. If they do not, India will be awarded the match without a ball being bowled, in line with ICC regulations.","Pakistan's decision to boycott their Group A match against India at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 has shifted the focus to how such a situation is handled under ICC playing conditions.

T20 World Cup: Squads, Full Schedule, Venues and Key Details Explained

NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has responded to Pakistan’s decision to boycott its February 15 match against India at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, calling the move a serious concern for the global game.In an official statement, the ICC acknowledged the announcement made by Pakistan’s government but made it clear that selective participation does not fit with the core idea of an international tournament.“The ICC notes the statement that the government of Pakistan has made regarding the decision to instruct its national team to selectively participate in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026,” the statement said.The ICC added that it is still waiting for formal communication from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).However, it stressed that skipping a scheduled match goes against the basic principles of a world event.“This position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule,” the ICC added.The governing body underlined that ICC tournaments are based on fairness and integrity.“ICC tournaments are built on sporting integrity, competitiveness, consistency and fairness, and selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competitions,” it stated.While respecting the role of governments, the ICC said the decision hurts the sport and fans. “While the ICC respects the roles of governments in matters of national policy, this decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan,” the statement added.The ICC also warned about long-term consequences. “The ICC hopes that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country,” it said, pointing out that such actions affect the entire cricket ecosystem.The council stressed its main goal. “The ICC's priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup,” and it expects all members, including the PCB, to help find “a mutually acceptable resolution.”Earlier, Pakistan’s government confirmed it would allow the team to travel to Sri Lanka but instructed it not to play India.",ICC responds to Pakistan's decision to boycott its February 15 match against India.

Chennai Crowd Standing Ovation to Pakistan Cricket Team. Chennai Test 1999. Amazing sportsmanship

For those who have begun watching India vs Pakistan cricket only in recent times, it can be easy to assume that matches between the two sides have always been dominated by politics, hostility, aggression from crowd, and the absence of even basic sporting courtesies.While there have always been some kind of political context to their encounters, and an ""at your face"" approach whenever both sides faced each other, there was some kind of respect for the players and the great game that they were playing, to not let politics or jingoism take over the sport. Perhaps nothing captures it better than the Chennai Test of 1999, which India lost, after a batting masterclass by Sachin Tendulkar.The political atmosphere was high then, too. Pakistan arrived in India for the first Test between the two arch-rivals in nine years, but the venue for the first match of the series had to be changed as, weeks before the series was set to kick off, some extremists dug up the pitch at the Firoz Shah Kotla Stadium in Delhi, the original venue for the first Test.Chennai's MA Chidambaram Stadium, which originally was due to host the second Test, was then selected to host the first match as venues for the first and second Test matches were swapped.The outrage by some fringe extremist groups continued, and against this backdrop, the first Test of the series began on January 28, 1999, at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. The Stadium was guarded by 3,000 police and military officials.Pakistan captain Wasim Akram won the toss and opted to bat first as India handed Sadagoppan Ramesh his Test debut. Pakistan were once struggling at 91-5 as Kumble and Srinath sent Saeed Anwar, Shahid Afridi, Ijaz, Inzamam, and Saleem Malik back to pavillion. However, Moin Khan (60) and Mohammad Yousuf (53) fought back to guide the visitors to a first innings score of 238.Debutant Ramesh and VVS Laxman put on a brisk 48 for India on the evening of day one, but both were dismissed by Wasim Akram within half an hour of play resuming. Then Saqlain Mushtaq took the first of his 20 wickets in this series when his tantalising length accounted for Tendulkar; the batsman dashed down the wicket, mis-hit and scooped a catch to backward point for a third-ball duck. But Dravid and Ganguly helped India towards a narrow 16-run lead before the spinners finished them off.By the end of Day 2, Pakistan were 34/1 and day three belonged to Shahid Afridi as he struck 141 off 191 balls, hitting 21 fours and three sixes. He got ample support from Inzamam ul-Haq (51), and Saleem Malik (32) as Pakistan finished their second innings at 286. Venkatesh Prasad took 6 wickets in the innings as India were set the target of 271 to chase in the fourth innings on a tough Chennai pitch.India finished day 3 at 40/2, with both openers, Ramesh and Laxman, back in the hut. On the day 4 morning, Akram removed Dravid thanks to an absolute peach of a delivery. Then Saqlain Mushtaq got the better of India captain Mohammad Azharuddin (5) and Sourav Ganguly (2). At 82 for 5 before lunch on the fourth day, 271 looked distant for India, and a defeat inevitable. But Sachin Tendulkar stood firm and tall, despite battling a back injury.Saqlain Mushtaq and Wasim bowled in tandem after lunch. Facing them, Tendulkar and Mongia. India didn't lose a wicket between lunch and Tea.Pakistan took the new ball in the third session with 95 needed and Sachin and Mongia still on the wicket for India. Tendulkar's back had ""all but given up"" on him. The next five overs brought 33.India were still 53 short when Mongia slogged Wasim across the line and got the top edge, ball went straight to Waqar Younis at covers.Still, Tendulkar kept going, despite a back strain. At 254 for 6 on the day 4 afternoon, India needed only 17 to win with Tendulkar still at the crease, batting at 136 off 273 balls. But then he mistimed a lofted drive off Saqlain Mushtaq, and Wasim Akram caught him at mid-off.Commentator Harsha Bhogle called it on air: ""Oh dear… he's got the leading edge… man's under it… it's taken… what have we got here… Sachin Tendulkar's knocked on the door… it's still closed…""Tendulkar walked out of the ground after a masterful innings, and with him went India's hope as Wasim Akram and Saqlain Mushtaq ran through India's lower order, taking the last 3 wickets for just 4 runs. India were out for 258, and Pakistan clinched a historic victory by 12 runs. Saqlain Mushtaq took 10 wickets in the match.Pakistani players bowed to the ground in prayer and embarked on a lap of honour. Instead of hostility, they were met with a standing ovation from the Chennai crowd.Bhogle, on air, said he had never seen ""a stronger statement in favour of sport than this."" ""We’ve had a fascinating game of cricket, but this is the best sight you will see anywhere in the world. Pakistan are going on a victory lap and the crowd here in Chennai are standing up and applauding them. If you ever wanted to see a victory for sport, here it is on your television screens, in your drawing rooms. Pakistan are taking a victory lap far away from their homeland, here in Chennai in India, and they are getting a rousing reception,"" Bhpgle said.""I’ve never seen a stronger statement in sport than this. This crowd has been absolutely fantastic. Pakistan realizes that. There has been no jingoism. The spectators have supported the home team as they must, but they have also appreciated everything that has happened in this match. If this isn’t what sport stands for, I don’t know what is.""The match ended on this day, January 31, in 1999.","Sachin Tendulkar scored 273 not out in the first Test against Pakistan in Chennai in 1999. The match was played at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, which was guarded by 3,000 police and military officials. India lost the Test by 16 runs, and Pakistan won the series 1-0.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127823603,imgsize-82656,width-400,resizemode-4/lkj-28.jpg"

Shivam Dube press conference: On mindset shift, reading bowlers and dominating middle overs

Poll Do you believe Shivam Dube will significantly impact India's performance in the upcoming T20 World Cup? Yes, definitely Maybe, depends on form No, unlikely

It’s hard to find positives in a 50-run loss in a T20I game but the Indian team won’t be too unhappy with what transpired in the fourth T20I in Vizag. The 23-ball 65 by Shivam Dube after a top-order wobble was a reminder to opposition teams about the dynamite batter India will have up their sleeve in the middle order in the T20 World Cup starting next month.IPL watchers will know that teams are wary of using spin against Chennai Super Kings ’ Dube after the 10th over. In CSK, where the gentle giant has been playing since 2022, Dube has flourished in this role.Incidentally, Dube had made his T20I debut for India before he played for CSK. But in the 13 T20Is that he played before that as a middle-order batter who could bowl medium-pace, the left-hander failed to carve his niche. CSK first took note of him during an inconsequential IPL game in Abu Dhabi in 2021, when they had already qualified for a top-two finish.In that match, Dube was playing for Rajasthan Royals. Chasing 190, Dube came up with a 42-ball 64 which led to CSK’s defeat. MS Dhoni and CSK coach Stephen Fleming identified the talent that Dube had against spin and in the auctions for the 2022 edition, he was picked for Rs 4 crore.Still, Dube wasn’t a sure-fire selection. Before the IPL, five-time champions CSK had a training camp in Surat.During that camp, Dube’s over-boundaries, using his long levers against spin, were often beating MS Dhoni’s sixes by 20-30 metres. Some of those sixes even broke the window panes in the fourth-tier balconies of the stadium.That show convinced the management of his big-hitting abilities but Dube’s CSK stint hadn’t started on a happy note. He had given away 25 runs in the 19th over against LSG in Mumbai and had become a bit of a villain for the fans of the ‘Yellow Army’. But Dhoni stressed that bowling wasn’t the reason CSK had bought Dube and persisted with him purely as a batter.The temperamentally sound southpaw eventually announced himself with a 46-ball 95 against RCB in Mumbai, when he took down the likes of Wanindu Hasaranga and Glenn Maxwell. He hasn’t looked back since and despite several attempts by other franchises to lure him out of CSK, the team management has stuck with him, making him one of their highest-paid retainees for Rs 12 crore.While Dube has gone from strength to strength with his performances against spin, sometimes his technique against genuine pace has been a bit of a worry. The short ball has troubled him on and off but Dube has worked on it. These days, he is quite effective against medium-pacers, as was evident on Wednesday when he took on the likes of Zak Foulkes and Jacob Duffy.But during his four-year stint in CSK, one area that has been neglected a bit is his bowling. Due to the impact player rule, the think-tank hasn’t found the necessity to give him enough overs. But the Indian team management wants to use his bowling skills as well and in the Asia Cup final against Pakistan in Dubai last year, he was given the responsibility of opening the attack in spinfriendly conditions.Dube has developed a clever change of pace and the occasional wide yorker. One feels he isn’t too far behind with the ball to Nitish Reddy, who is being prepared as a back-up mediumpace allrounder for Hardik Pandya .",Shivam Dube has flourished in the middle order for Chennai Super Kings.

NEW DELHI: Former India men’s hockey team coach Michael Nobbs, who reintroduced Aussieslike aggression and counter-attacking styles of field play after the team had fallen into the rut of European defensive skill sets, passed away at his home in Melbourne on Thursday after losing a long-running battle with lung cancer, which was first detected in March 2020.Nobbs, who coached the Bharat Chettri-led men’s side at the 2012 London Olympics, was 72. Nobbs’ India coaching stint lasted from June 2011 to July 2013.Nobbs was a member of the Australian team at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. His subsequent transition to full-time coaching made him one of the most respected tacticians in world hockey.He focused on counter-attacking strategies inspired by Australian methods and relied on a scientific approach. Nobbs successfully defeated cancer when it was initially diagnosed five years ago but suffered a relapse earlier last year.Nobbs took over the reins of the Indian men’s team at a particularly tough time. The highlight of Nobbs’ tenure was India’s qualification for the 2012 Olympics in London after the Beijing fall without losing a single match (six in total) during the qualifiers. However, India had a disappointing campaign in London, where the Chettri-led side finished last among 12 nations.",Former India men's hockey team coach Michael Nobbs has died at the age of 72.

‘Have to pick spinners who can pick fivers’

Thakur to return for Ranji quarters

Karnataka overhaul 250 in 27.5 overs, reach quarters

Bengaluru:

Brief scores:

In Mumbai: Delhi 221 & 407/6d in 105 overs (V Kandpal 61, A Doseja 159*; H Singh 3/86) drew vs Mumbai 317;

In Mohali: Punjab 309 and 256 (U Saharan 44, Prasidh 3-44) lost to Karnataka 316 & 252/5 (D Padikkal 120*) by 5 wickets.

MUMBAI: Delhi may have crashed out of the Ranji Trophy at the league stage this season, finishing without an outright win in seven matches (they drew six out of them) but in young talented batting guns Ayush Doseja and Sanat Sangwan, they seem to have discovered two red-ball gems.On Sunday, Doseja, stepping in as the captain of the team at the last minute after Ayush Badoni had to report for India A duty, slammed his fourth century of the season, a gallant, unbeaten 159 (230b, 11x4, 2x6), after resuming from his overnight score of 62 to help Delhi finish at 407 for six and earn a hard-fought draw against Mumbai in their last league match of the Ranji Trophy at the MCA ground in BKC.When the players shook hands at 2.10pm, Doseja, who has taken to first-class cricket like duck to water, finished his debut season with 949 runs in seven matches@105.44-an incredible feat indeed by the 23-year-old. In fact, if Delhi weren’t knocked out of the tournament, the lad from Rohini, the highest run-getter in India after the league stage of the Ranji Trophy, would’ve earned a rare distinction of scoring 1,000 runs in his debut first-class season.Immediately after the proceedings ended, the young left-hander and his teammate Sanat Sangwan, who slammed a superb century (118) in the first innings, approached Mumbai’s in-form batter Sarfaraz Khan -a domestic run-machine-for some tips on playing on red soil-something that he doesn’t get to do often as back in Delhi, he gets to play on black soil pitches. “He is a big player in domestic cricket. So, I asked him how I can be better while playing on red soil wickets. I am trying to be a three-format player. Sarfaraz. He told me that on red soil wickets, it would be better if I keep my head down while batting. You will then hit less ‘casual shots,’ because I survived two-three dropped catches, as the ball bounces a bit on red soil. He was saying that if I was having a bad day, those catches would’ve been taken. He said that I could change my game according to whether I play on a back soil or red soil pitch,” Doseja told reporters.Indeed, Doseja was dropped thrice, once by substitute fielder Akhil Hewadkar on 99 at short extra cover off Himanshu Singh, and later by substitute fielder Sairaj Patil at deep mid-wicket off Shams Mulani and then on 158 by Mulani at lone slip of Himanshu again. It must also be said thatMumbai, having already qualified for the knockouts, didn’t exert themselves. However, all this should take anything away from his gallant effort and fabulous consistency.Doseja slammed centuries (104* & 129) in each innings against Chhattisgarh at the BCCI’s centre of Excellence in Bengaluru and 209 against Hyderabad in Hyderabad on his first-class debut, but he rates his match-saving century against Mumbai in Mumbai as his “best” of his nascent career so far. During the Vijay Hazare Trophy, modern-day cricket legend Virat Kohli advised Doseja to give his “200%” in every match, and the youngster is sticking to that mantra from the maestro.Asked on where Delhi failed to make it to the KOs of the Ranji Trophy despite he and Sangwan (828 runs in seven matches@69.00) being the top two run-getters in the league phase of the 2025-25 Ranji Trophy season, Doseja pointed out to the lack of good spinners in the side.“I was talking to the coach, our spinners and fast bowlers can be better in red-ball cricket. When we come to play the Ranji Trophy next season, we will have to work on our bowlers. We will have to pick spinners who can take five wickets. We had this problem the whole season. We didn't have spinners who can take 10 (opposition) wickets. In this match also, it was a seaming wicket, and we thought that if the spinners stopped runs from one end, the fast bowlers could have taken wickets from the other. But the runs didn't stop (leaking), otherwise we would have won the match on the first innings lead.”Mumbai, who finished the league stage as Group D toppers with 33 points in seven matches, will be boosted by the return of captain Shardul Thakur , who has recovered from calf injury, for the Ranji Trophy quarterfinals, which start from Feb 6. Thakur bowled in the nets at BKC during the Delhi versus Mumbai game.Sunday evening will be remembered for one of the finest knocks by young captain Devdutt Padikkal and a chase for the ages as Karnataka scripted a memorable win in their fixture against Punjab in Mohali.Needing a win to qualify for the quarterfinals, they were set a target of 250 in 40 overs. Padikkal led from the front with an unbeaten 120 off 85 balls (6x4; 5x6), guiding Karnataka to a five-wicket victory in just 27.5 overs despite fading light and mounting pressure.",Ayush Doseja scores unbeaten 159 as Delhi draw with Mumbai in Ranji Trophy. Delhi finished without an outright win in seven matches (they drew six out of them) Sanat Sangwan scored 118 in Mumbai's first innings. Sangwan is the top run-getter in the league phase of the Ranji trophy.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127852005,imgsize-151682,width-400,resizemode-4/ranji-trophy-delhi-vs-mumbai.jpg"

Delhi Capitals had to grind it out but eventually crossed the line, beating UP Warriorz by five wickets in a low-scoring contest to book their place in the Women’s Premier League Eliminator on Sunday.The victory, achieved with eight balls remaining, also ended the defending champions Mumbai Indians ’ campaign, knocking them out of the playoff race.Delhi, who have reached all three WPL finals so far without lifting the trophy, will now face an in-form Gujarat Giants in the Eliminator at the Baroda Cricket Association Stadium on Tuesday. The winner of that clash will take on Royal Challengers Bengaluru on Thursday.Chasing a modest target of 123, Delhi were well placed at 84 for one before a sudden slide saw them lose four wickets for 17 runs. They eventually finished on 126 for five in 18.4 overs. Captain Jemimah Rodrigues held her nerve at the end, finishing unbeaten on 34 off 18 balls with five boundaries, alongside Niki Prasad, who remained not out on four.At the top, Shafali Verma contributed a patient 29, while Laura Wolvaardt anchored the chase with a composed 47 off 36 deliveries, striking seven fours. The pair added 73 runs for the second wicket after Delhi lost Lizelle Lee early for 10.Despite the presence of quality spinners Sophie Ecclestone and Deepti Sharma, UP Warriorz lacked runs to properly pressure Delhi. A brief wobble late in the chase raised hopes, but Jemimah’s back-to-back boundaries off Deepti in the penultimate over settled the contest.Earlier, Delhi’s bowlers laid the platform by restricting UP Warriorz to 122 for eight. Marizanne Kapp led the effort with figures of 3 for 30, while Chinelle Henry chipped in with 2 for 25.UP Warriorz endured a poor start, losing captain Meg Lanning on the first ball, and never found momentum. Kapp removed Deepti Sharma, Charli Knott and Deandra Dottin, while Henry dismissed Simran Shaikh just as she threatened to revive the innings. Deepti’s 24 and an unbeaten 23 from Shikha Pandey were the only notable contributions in an otherwise disjointed batting effort.Brief Scores: UP Warriorz 122/8 in 20 overs (Deepti Sharma 24, Shikha Pandey 23 not out; Chinelle Henry 2/25, Marizanne Kapp 3/30) lost to Delhi Capitals 126/5 in 18.4 overs (Shafali Verma 29, Laura Wolvaardt 47, Jemimah Rodrigues 34 not out; Deepti Sharma 2/27) by five wickets.","Delhi Capitals beat UP Warriorz by five wickets to reach Women's Premier League Eliminator.

Pakistan produced a commanding performance to hand Australia its heaviest ever defeat in T20 cricket, sealing a 3-0 series sweep just five days ahead of the T20 World Cup. On Sunday, the hosts defeated the Australians by 111 runs in the third and final match at a ground where spinners once again dominated. The victory surpassed Australia’s previous largest T20 loss, a 100-run defeat to England at Southampton in 2005.Electing to bat first, Pakistan posted a daunting 207-6, their highest-ever T20 total against Australia. Opener Saim Ayub contributed 56 off 57 balls, while Babar Azam , batting at the new No.4 position, anchored the innings with an unbeaten 50 off 36 deliveries. Shadab Khan then blazed 46 off 19 balls, hitting five sixes to take Pakistan past the 200-run mark.Australia’s struggles against spin continued as left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz claimed a career-best 5-18 on a slow wicket. Earlier, Shaheen Shah Afridi cleaned up Australia’s top order, dismissing captain Mitchell Marsh and Matt Renshaw in his first two overs. Nawaz later removed Marcus Stoinis , Cameron Green , Josh Philippe, and Cooper Connolly to complete a five-wicket haul, leaving Australia all out for 96 in just 16.5 overs.Captain Salman Ali Agha praised his team’s performance. “From the last two days, we have been excellent in all departments, I can’t find any mistakes.We dominated them. I am in a great frame of mind right now. I know how to handle the captaincy when I go out to bat and I really want to do that in the World Cup as well,” he said.Australia captain Marsh admitted the visitors were outplayed throughout the series. “Chasing is hard on that surface… we will take learnings from that. We will certainly address this series and look forward to the World Cup,” he said.Pakistan had won the first two matches by 19 and 90 runs, respectively, and now enter the T20 World Cup on a dominant note, having shown both batting firepower and spin mastery.","Pakistan beat Australia by 111 runs in the third and final match of the T20 series.

Sanju Samson or Ishan Kishan? | Greenstone Lobo predicts the ideal player for T20 World Cup

Thiruvananthapuram: Opportunity in international cricket rarely arrives gift-wrapped. More often, it comes on the back of someone else’s misfortune, demanding to be seized without hesitation. Tilak Varma’s injury did precisely that for Ishan Kishan Given a full series to press his claim, Kishan turned every outing into a statement. A brutal 76 off 32 in Raipur set the tone, a whirlwind 28 off 13 in Guwahati kept the momentum, and then came the crescendo at Thiruvananthapuram — a thunderous 103 off 43 balls — his maiden T20I century on Sanju Samson ’s home turf. By the time the series against New Zealand was wrapped up, Kishan wasn’t auditioning anymore; he was occupying the role.In a format where hesitation is fatal, Kishan’s decisiveness is his biggest strength.There is, of course, a caveat. If he opens with Abhishek Sharma at the showpiece event, it would mean two left-handers at the top, potentially leaving India with six left-hand batters in the top eight if Tilak Varma, Rinku Singh, Shivam Dube and Axar Patel all play. On paper, that imbalance matters. In practice, the gulf between Kishan and his competitors has grown too wide for it to be a deal-breaker.The subtext told its own story. In the fifth T20I, Kishan walked out wearing the wicketkeeper’s gloves. Captain Suryakumar Yadav clarified it was pre-planned. “We had decided before the series that Sanju would keep in three games and Ishan in two,” he said. But optics matter in elite sport.Kishan had an off day behind the stumps, but it didn’t hurt India in Thiruvananthapuram.In contrast, Samson’s walk back after a six-ball stay on Saturday had a familiar air of disbelief — the bat dangling, the eyes searching for answers.Over time, his footwork has drifted into a pattern that is now being ruthlessly exposed. Where modern greats like Rohit Sharma press forward — a subtle front-foot trigger that keeps both sides of the field in play — Samson does the opposite. Instead of going back and across, he goes back and towards the leg side.This movement narrows his options. By setting up so leg-side dominant, Samson is effectively preparing for one half of the field. Anything on his pads, anything he can whip or flick. But when the ball is delivered on middle and off, he’s suddenly chasing it, bat fishing outside the line of his body.That’s when timing deserts him. Control goes missing. And the outside edge comes into play. Lockie Ferguson didn’t need trickery. Extra pace, a hard length, and a ball angled outside off. Samson, already moving leg-side, had to manufacture a shot. The result was predictable: a thick edge and a forlorn walk back to the pavilion. Forty-six runs from five games tell a sorry tale.Kishan, meanwhile, has marched straight through, having all but sealed the wicketkeeper’s slot for the T20 World Cup.","Ishan Kishan has all but sealed the wicketkeeper’s slot for the T20 World Cup.

India head into the T20 World Cup 2026 on home soil carrying the weight of expectation, widely viewed as the team to beat. After lifting the trophy in 2024, Suryakumar Yadav ’s side has been backed by many to defend the title and script history by becoming the first team to win the T20 World Cup across three editions. Former India captain Sourav Ganguly also counts India among the frontrunners, though he has sounded a note of caution ahead of the marquee event.Speaking in a video shared by the Cricket Association of Bengal on Instagram, Ganguly underlined the importance of timing form correctly at major tournaments. “What’s important in these big tournaments is to peak at the right time and play well during the tournament,” he said.The former skipper was quick to reiterate his faith in the current squad, pointing to the balance and depth across departments. “India is a very strong team and I think they are at their best at the moment. The batting, the spin department, the seam bowling led by (Jasprit) Bumrah. So, there is a lot of quality in the side,” Ganguly said.While acknowledging that past results offer no guarantees, Ganguly remained optimistic about India rising to the occasion.“I know past has got no meaning but, they will peak at the big tournament and I think they will be one of my favourites,” he added.India’s confidence is underpinned by a dominant run in T20I cricket. Since winning the 2024 World Cup, they have not lost a bilateral T20I series under Suryakumar Yadav’s leadership. Individually, Abhishek Sharma sits atop the ICC T20I batting rankings, while mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy leads the bowlers’ list.In the group stage of the T20 World Cup 2026, India will face USA, Namibia, the Netherlands and Pakistan, with the top two teams progressing to the next round.","India head into the T20 World Cup 2026 on home soil carrying the weight of expectation.

Pakistan spinner Usman Tariq found himself at the centre of attention following the second T20I against Australia in Lahore, responding pointedly on social media after an on-field moment involving Cameron Green sparked debate.The episode unfolded at the Gaddafi Stadium on Saturday during Australia’s run chase. Green, attempting an attacking stroke in the 11th over, was dismissed by Tariq. As the Australian all-rounder headed back to the dressing room, television cameras caught him making a hand movement that many viewers interpreted as an insinuation about the legality of Tariq’s bowling action. The clip spread rapidly online, triggering intense discussion and even calls from some quarters for action against the Pakistan spinner.A day later, Tariq appeared to hit back without naming names. He shared a meme on Instagram on Sunday, implying that the reaction stemmed from frustration after being dismissed. While no direct reference was made to Green, the post was widely viewed as a response to the incident from the previous night.Tariq’s bowling action has long drawn scrutiny due to its unconventional nature, which includes a noticeable pause before the ball is released. During his career, he has twice been reported for a suspect action in the Pakistan Super League . On both occasions, he subsequently underwent testing and was cleared.He was also caught up in a similar controversy ahead of the ILT20 final in the UAE, where he defended his action by stating it remained within the permitted 15-degree limit for elbow extension.On the field, Pakistan dominated the contest. After choosing to bat first, they racked up an imposing 198 for 20 overs, built around a commanding 76 from captain Salman Agha and a fluent 53 by wicketkeeper-batter Usman Khan. Australia’s reply never gained momentum, and they were bowled out for 108 in 15.4 overs, with Green the only batter to get past 30.

Arsenal settled any fears of a wobble in their pursuit of a first Premier League title in 22 years by winning 4-0 at Leeds on Saturday.The Gunners' advantage over Manchester City and Aston Villa, who are both in action on Sunday, stretches to seven points as Mikel Arteta 's men took another step towards the title at Elland Road.A first home defeat of the season last weekend to Manchester United capped a run of just two points from a possible nine in Arsenal's previous three league games.After finishing runners-up for the past three seasons, questions were raised over the mentality of Arteta's men to get over the line in a title race.The visitors were dealt another blow before kick-off as Bukayo Saka was injured in the warm-up.But his replacement Noni Madueke played a major part in inflicting just a second defeat in 12 games on Leeds.Madueke's cross was headed in by Martin Zubimendi to open the scoring.Leeds goalkeeper Karl Darlow could then only parry another dangerous delivery from the England winger into his own goal before half-time.Despite a fine run of form, Leeds remain only six points above the relegation zone.Their first defeat at home since November was confirmed when the much-criticised Viktor Gyokeres latched onto Gabriel Martinelli's cross to blast in his 11th goal since joining Arsenal from Sporting Lisbon.Gabriel Jesus came off the bench to round off the scoring with a blistering strike four minutes from time.Arsenal will be hoping local rivals Tottenham can do them a favour when City visit north London, while Villa host Brentford on Sunday.Chelsea can climb into the top four later should they maintain their bright start under Liam Rosenior against West Ham at Stamford Bridge.Liverpool are aiming to ease the pressure on Arne Slot at Anfield in Saturday's late kick-off when they host Newcastle.Everton snatched a 1-1 draw at Brighton thanks to Beto's 97th-minute equaliser in a result that does little for either side's aspirations of European football next season.Pascal Gross' first goal since returning to the Seagulls from Borussia Dortmund put Brighton in front.Bournemouth ended any remaining worries of being dragged into a relegation fight as goals from Eli Kroupi and Alex Scott earned a 2-0 win at bottom-of-the-table Wolves.The Cherries climb up to 12th and 13 points clear of the relegation zone.",Arsenal beat Leeds 4-0 at Elland Road to extend their lead to seven points.

The German football federation has ruled out a boycott of the World Cup despite calls from within to send a message to U.S. President Donald Trump “We believe in the unifying power of sport and the global impact that a FIFA World Cup can have, the federation said in a statement issued late Friday. “Our goal is to strengthen this positive force — not to prevent it. ”The federation, known as the DFB, said its executive committee met and discussed the option of a boycott of the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico, a consideration first proposed last week by DFB vice president Oke Göttlich.Göttlich, who is also the president of Bundesliga club St. Pauli, referred to Trump's recent actions and statements and said it was time to “seriously consider” a boycott.In what appears to be a public rebuke to Göttlich, however, the DFB said “debates on sports policy should be conducted internally and not in public.”The DFB said a boycott “is not currently under consideration. The DFB is in contact with representatives from politics, security, business, and sports in preparation for the tournament” from June 11-July 19.Trump has sowed discord in Europe with his takeover bid for Greenland and threats to impose tariffs on European countries that opposed it, while U.S.actions in Venezuela and at home in dealing with protests in American cities have also raised alarm.Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter last week advised fans to stay away from the tournament.When president, however, Blatter opposed calls to boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia over concerns about Ukraine.“Football can not be boycotted in any country,” he said at the time.Ahead of this summer's tournament, fans have concerns about high ticket prices, while travel bans imposed by the Trump administration could also prohibit supporters from some competing nations from attending.Germany’s team, at least, will be there.“We want to compete fairly against the other qualified teams next summer,” the DFB said. “And we want fans worldwide to celebrate a peaceful festival of football in the stadiums and at fan zones — just as we experienced at the 2024 European Championship in our own country.”","The German football federation has ruled out a boycott of the World Cup despite calls from within to send a message to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Poll How do you feel about the crowd's behavior during the African Cup final? Completely unacceptable A result of passion Somewhat understandable

Africa’s football governing body has handed down fines exceeding $1 million and imposed multiple bans following a chaotic African Cup final that descended into protests, crowd trouble and ugly scenes on and off the pitch.The Confederation of African Football (CAF) announced the sanctions on Wednesday in response to the disorder-marred final between Senegal and hosts Morocco on January 18, a match that featured a dramatic walk-off protest, fans attempting to storm the field and even scuffles involving journalists. Crucially, CAF clarified that the bans apply only to African competitions and will not affect the upcoming World Cup in June, for which both Senegal and Morocco have already qualified.CAF fined the Senegalese Football Federation $615,000 and the Moroccan federation $315,000 for unsporting and improper conduct by players, coaching staff and supporters. Senegal coach Pape Thiaw received the heaviest individual punishment — a five-match ban in CAF competitions and a personal fine of $100,000 — after leading his players off the pitch in protest at a late penalty awarded to Morocco.The final was halted for around 15 minutes following the walk-off.When play resumed, Morocco missed the penalty and Senegal went on to clinch the African title with a 1-0 win after extra time.The fallout extended far beyond the walk-off. Supporters tried to breach the pitch, players from both teams clashed on the sidelines, and reporters from Senegal and Morocco were involved in fights in press areas. One of the most bizarre flashpoints came when Moroccan ball boys attempted to snatch a towel from Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy, apparently to distract him. That incident alone resulted in an additional $200,000 fine for Morocco’s federation.Morocco coach Walid Regragui later described the spectacle as giving African football a “shameful” image, a comment that resonated as scrutiny intensified on the country, which will co-host the 2030 World Cup with Spain and Portugal and hopes to stage the final at the 115,000-capacity Hassan II Stadium currently under construction.CAF also banned Senegal’s Iliman Ndiaye and Ismaila Sarr for two matches each, while Morocco’s Achraf Hakimi received a two-match ban with one suspended. Ismael Saibari was hit with a three-match ban and a $100,000 fine for unsporting behaviour.An appeal by Morocco to have the result annulled and the title awarded to them was dismissed. The match even strained diplomatic ties, though Senegal Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko later played down the fallout, calling the reaction “emotional outbursts produced by fervor” rather than a deeper rift.","Africa's football governing body hands down fines exceeding $1 million.

The Chinese Football Association (CFA) announced Thursday that 73 people, including former national team coach Li Tie, have been banned for life, and 13 professional clubs have been fined for match-fixing and corruption.The punishments come as part of a wider anti-corruption campaign under President Xi Jinping, which has removed several CFA officials and banned dozens of players for match-fixing and gambling.The statement did not say when the most recent match-fixing occurred or give details of the cases.The punishments were made after a ""systematic review"" and were needed ""to enforce industry discipline, purify the football environment, and maintain fair competition"", the CFA wrote on its official social media account Thursday.Li Tie, a former Everton player who coached China’s national team from 2019 to 2021, is already serving a 20-year prison sentence for bribery, after being sentenced in December 2024.Chen Xuyuan, former CFA chairman, is also serving a life sentence for accepting $11 million in bribes.Of the 16 teams in the 2025 Chinese Super League, 11 will face point deductions and fines.Tianjin Jinmen Tiger and last season’s runners-up Shanghai Shenhua will each lose 10 points and pay a one million yuan ($144,000) fine when the 2026 season begins.Shanghai Port, champions for the past three seasons, and Beijing Guoan will each lose five points and pay a 400,000-yuan fine.","73 people, including former national team coach Li Tie, have been banned for life. 13 professional clubs have been fined for match-fixing and corruption.

Real Madrid dropped into the Champions League knockout playoffs after losing 4-2 at Benfica on Wednesday, finishing ninth in the 36-team league standings. Despite scoring twice through Kylian Mbappé, Madrid slipped out of the top eight and missed direct qualification to the round of 16.Benfica secured the final playoff spot in 24th place on goal difference after scoring in the eighth minute of stoppage time. Goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin scored with a header after Madrid had been reduced to nine players following red cards for Raul Asencio and Rodrygo. Benfica’s progress eliminated Marseille, which fell to 25th after a 3-0 loss at Club Brugge.“This victory is historic and important,"" Mourinho said, adding of his goalkeeper: ""We knew that he could do it. You have to put the ball there, but it’s an amazing goal for the guy.”Trubin said it was a “crazy moment. I’m not used to scoring. I’m 24 years old and it’s the first time.”Madrid fell to ninth place after Sporting Lisbon scored in stoppage time to win 3-2 at Athletic Bilbao.“They have outplayed us,"" Real Madrid coach Álvaro Arbeloa said of Benfica.

Poll Are you excited for the start of the 2025-26 Indian Super League season? Absolutely! Somewhat Not Really Not at all

The 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season is tentatively scheduled to get underway on February 14 with a double header featuring Mohun Bagan Super Giant vs Kerala Blasters at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata and FC Goa vs Inter Kashi at Fatorda in Goa. The fixtures, running until May 17, are provisional as the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is looking to find a broadcaster to showcase India's top-division football.The AIFF is in the process of finding a suitable bidder to produce and broadcast the 91-match competition. If and when the bidder is found, the fixtures could be jiggled to meet the broadcasters' criteria.Four entities - FanCode, Sony Sports Network, Zee Sports and UK-based Two Circles - had attended the pre-bid conference. There is a possibility that more could throw their hat in the ring before the February 1 final date for submission of bids.As the process continues to unravel behind the scenes at the Football House (AIFF's headquarters) in New Delhi, there are a couple of questions that remain unanswered. Chief among them is the relegation clause.Promotion has been a part of the ISL since the 2022-23 season with Inter Kashi the latest team to come up the ladder from the I-League. Relegation, however, has never been a feature of the league that began in 2014.After Football Sports Development Limited's (FSDL) contract to run the ISL expired in December 2025, it is the first time that the AIFF are in charge of operating the ISL. The position on relegation gets trickier because of the Supreme Court-ratified Constitution.As per the Constitution adopted in October 2025, AIFF have the control over relegation rule. As per Article 63, ""Without prejudice to the foregoing, the AIFF shall have the right and discretion to take all decisions of any nature pertaining to any aspect of any competition. While exercising such discretion, the AIFF shall have due regard to the interests of the sport of Football in India and shall not be bound by any request or demand of any third party in this regard. If any of its powers or functions are delegated to third parties, such delegation shall be done in good faith and also ensuring that the AIFF retains primacy on all Essential Aspects.""A closer look at the definition of ""Essential Aspects"" explains it as ""preservation of the sanctity of promotion and relegation, and ensuring of compliance with FIFA/AFC statues with respect to the sport of football.""In essence, promotion and relegation are mandatory from the 2025/26 season onwards in the ISL.An AIFF insider told TimesofIndia.com that the relegation rules will be followed as per what is written in the Constitution.However, a majority of ISL clubs are not happy with the idea. With the season already starting five months late and to be played in a truncated format, the clubs are expecting minimal revenue. The financial strain has forced the clubs to reduce costs through operational cutbacks and salary corrections. A few clubs even paused first team operations before a headway arrived on January 6 courtesy Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya's intervention.One ISL club official has even asked AIFF to take cognisance of the situation and invoke force majeure, which is possible as per the AIFF Constitution.Article 78 reads: ""The General Body shall have the final decision on any matters not provided for in this Constitution and Regulations, or in cases of force majeure. General Body shall be competent to decide whether a situation amounts to force majeure scenario or not.""As things stand, AIFF has not approached the Supreme Court seeking a one-time relaxation from relegation for the 2025-26 ISL season. With two weeks to go into the start of the season, it remains to be seen if they will go against not just the Constitution but also the AFC Statutes.","The 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season is tentatively scheduled to get underway on February 14.

Miami Dolphins quietly preparing to move on from Tua Tagovailoa

The Miami Dolphins did not just change coaches this winter. Instead, they reset their direction. What once looked like a long-term partnership with Tua Tagovailoa now feels fragile, uncertain, and possibly near its end.Currently, two separate updates have sparked doubt about Tagovaila’s time in Miami. One came from inside the building, where new head coach Jeff Hafley refused to guarantee Tagovailoa’s job. While the other came from league insiders who claim Miami has already decided to move on. Together, they have created the biggest quarterback storm the franchise has faced in years.The sudden shock came when Hafley appeared on The Jim Rome Show.Asked directly if Tagovailoa would be his starter, Hafley avoided the label.“I had a good conversation with Tua,” Hafley said during the radio interview. “We talked about a lot of things, but ultimately, this is going to come down to whoever we believe gives us the best chance to win.”Days earlier, Hafley told NFL Network what he wants in a quarterback. “I want a winner. I want a guy who has it mentally. He’s gotta have it physically,” he said during the network segment.“I want a guy who can walk into a room, and everyone says, ‘That’s our quarterback.’”He further added, “I want a guy who's got it up here (pointing to his head). And I want a guy who's got it in his heart,"" Hafley told NFL Network. ""And I want a guy who's going to be able to walk into a room, and everyone will just say, 'That's our quarterback.'""Hafley didn't name a replacement, but Bolavip's latest reports allude that former NFL executive Joel Corry believes the Dolphins have already made their decision.“The Miami Dolphins appear to have already made a definitive decision regarding Tua Tagovailoa and his situation as the starting quarterback for 2026,” Corry said, according to the report. “It is only a matter of when he will be released.”Tagovailoa is entering the third year of his four-year, $212.4 million contract, which he signed in July 2024. But the numbers from 2025 told a rough story. He threw for 2,660 yards, 20 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions. Miami finished 7-10. Owner Stephen Ross fired Mike McDaniel shortly after the season ended.Health remains another toll. Tagovailoa has suffered five concussions between college and the NFL, including one in 2024 that kept him out for four weeks.With Hafley and new GM Jon Eric Sullivan now in charge, Miami is expected to explore free agency and the draft. One name already linked is Malik Willis, who played under Green Bay’s system.For now, Tagovailoa remains on the roster. But the language has changed. The tone has shifted. And in Miami, that usually means a bigger move is coming.",Tua Tagovailoa's future with the Miami Dolphins is uncertain. New head coach Jeff Hafley has refused to guarantee the quarterback's job.

Ryan Clark weighs in on Kwesi Adofo-Mensah situation and the expectations inside the NFL



The Minnesota Vikings surprised many across the NFL on Friday by firing general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah after four seasons in charge. The team did not provide a clear reason for the move, which quickly led to speculation around the league. Adofo-Mensah had been seen as part of the Vikings’ long-term plan, making the decision stand out even more in a league where front office stability is rare. As conversations grew, former NFL safety Ryan Clark emerged as one of the strongest voices reacting to the situation, offering a blunt take that reflected football’s long-standing mindset.As more details surfaced over the weekend, the discussion moved away from football decisions and toward a personal moment from Adofo-Mensah’s time in Minnesota.Reports revealed that he had taken a two-week paternity leave in 2023 following the birth of his son. While the leave was short, it reportedly surprised some within NFL circles and became a talking point among executives and coaches, highlighting how uncommon such breaks remain in professional football.Former NFL safety Ryan Clark reacted strongly to the reports, offering a blunt explanation that reflected his own experience inside the league.Clark did not focus on the Vikings’ decision itself. Instead, he spoke about the culture that has shaped football for decades and continues to influence how players, coaches, and executives are judged.“This one is tough, but it’s the culture of football,” Clark said. “Players miss births, birthdays, holidays, funerals and coaches to the same. It may not be right, but that’s what it is. There is no paternity leave for people who contribute to wins and losses! Probably a pretty unprecedented decision.”To support his point, Clark referenced Joe Brady, now the head coach of the Buffalo Bills, who previously admitted missing his child’s birth because of a game. The comparison showed how deeply these expectations are rooted across the sport.The reaction to Adofo-Mensah’s paternity leave has now sparked a wider conversation. Beyond one executive’s exit, Clark’s remarks have drawn attention to whether the NFL is ready to rethink its long-standing views on work, family, and leadership in today’s game.","The Minnesota Vikings fired general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah on Friday.

"Joe Burrow lands Pro Bowl honor despite missing half the season, igniting NFL debate",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/joe-burrow-lands-pro-bowl-honor-despite-missing-half-the-season-igniting-nfl-debate/articleshow/127850784.cms,"Joe Burrow lands Pro Bowl honor despite missing half the season, igniting NFL debate (Getty)

Joe Burrow was limited this season because of injury, but his Pro Bowl selection brings him to the spotlight.



Much like Shedeur Sanders, Joe Burrow was out of weekly matchups for most of the season. For a long stretch, the Cincinnati Bengals looked like a team searching for its identity without its franchise quarterback. Cincinnati adjusted under Joe Flacco’s presence, but could not book its spot in the Super Bowl. Just when it seemed the season would be defined by what Burrow missed, the NFL delivered news that no one saw coming.Just days before the Pro Bowl, Burrow’s name suddenly reappeared on one of the league’s biggest stages, setting off confusion, debate, and fresh conversation about how late-season performances are valued.The NFL confirmed on Sunday that Burrow had been added to the AFC roster for the 2026 Pro Bowl Games, scheduled for Tuesday, February 3, at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. As per Insider Mike Petragalia’s X post:“Joe Burrow will join Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins at the Pro Bowl Games in SF,”The timing raised eyebrows across the league, especially because the announcement arrived just one day after veteran quarterback Joe Flacco earned his first career Pro Bowl selection.The star QB was out for 9 straight games from Week 4 through Week 12 with a toe injury that forced the Bengals to rework their O-line and rely on other QB’s. By the time voting for the Pro Bowl likely closed, Burrow had barely returned, which left him buried in the early rankings and seemingly out of contention.Over the last six weeks of the season, Burrow produced one of the most reliable stretches by any QB in the league. He led the NFL with 152 completions, tied for second in TD passes with 15, ranked third in passing yards with 1,620, and finished fifth in completion percentage at 68.2 per cent and passer rating at 102.2.Throughout the season, the star QB completed 173 of 259 passes for 1,809 yards, 17 TD, and five interceptions, finishing with a 100.7 passer rating in just eight starts. The production, coupled with his late surge, made his omission impossible to justify once roster spots opened.Cincinnati now sends four players to the Pro Bowl. Along with Burrow and Flacco, wide receivers Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins earned selections after anchoring a passing attack that stayed competitive despite constant changes under center. Chase finished with 125 receptions for 1,412 yards and eight touchdowns, while Higgins posted 59 catches for 846 yards and 11 scores, despite working with three different quarterbacks.Burrow’s selection marks his third Pro Bowl appearance, following honours in 2022 and 2024. He now joins Ken Anderson, Andy Dalton, and Boomer Esiason as the only Bengals quarterbacks to reach that milestone.","Joe Burrow was out for 9 straight games from Week 4 through Week 12 with a toe injury.

Kristin Juszczyk sparks Super Bowl chatter while Drake Maye injury concern lingers



Kristin Juszczyk enters Super Bowl week as an unexpected name in the buildup, linking fashion buzz with football tension as the New England Patriots prepare for their season finale against the Seattle Seahawks. With the championship game set for February 8 at Levi’s Stadium, attention is split between off-field intrigue and on-field concern surrounding quarterback Drake Maye’s health.The Super Bowl always stretches beyond football, and this year feels no different. As fans finalize rituals and teams lock in last details, the Patriots’ camp is balancing excitement with caution. The spotlight has widened to include those closest to the players, turning small social media moments into talking points just days before kickoff.Kristin Juszczyk, known for her close ties across NFL circles, added fuel to the Super Bowl conversation with a simple Instagram story. She shared a photo of Drake Maye’s No. 10 Patriots jersey and tagged Ann Michael Maye, Drake’s wife. The post did not include a caption, but the timing spoke loudly. With Ann confirmed to attend the game in Santa Clara, the image hinted at shared plans and possibly a coordinated Super Bowl outfit moment that fans quickly picked up on.Fashion aside, New England’s on-field identity is already set. The Patriots finalized their Super Bowl look and will wear white jerseys with white pants. As reported by The Athletic’s Chad Graff, “A look at the patches and all white uniforms the Patriots will wear at the Super Bowl, via Devin McCourty’s IG. The Patriots are technically the home team, but wanted to embrace their “road warriors” mentality with the white jerseys after going 9-0 on the road,” The Athletic’s Chad Graff REPORTED. The same combination brought success in the AFC Championship win over Denver, a gritty 10-7 result that reinforced the team’s confidence in that choice.Yet, nothing matters more than Drake Maye’s status. He has driven New England’s offense all season and remains the engine behind their Super Bowl run. A recent injury report caused brief anxiety when Maye was listed as a limited participant. Context eased those fears. The designation was procedural since the team did not practice that week. There is no current indication that Maye will miss the Super Bowl, but the mention alone reminded fans how fragile championship hopes can feel.As kickoff approaches, the Patriots carry belief, superstition, and cautious optimism. From Kristin Juszczyk’s subtle tease to Drake Maye’s watchful recovery, Super Bowl week has already delivered its drama before a single snap is played.",Kristin Juszczyk shared a photo of Drake Maye’s No. 10 Patriots jersey and tagged Ann Michael Maye.

New England Patriots Super Bowl LX return sets stage for Seahawks rematch



The New England Patriots' Super Bowl LX journey officially began on Sunday as the franchise arrived in California with history, expectation and momentum in tow. Touching down at San Jose Mineta Airport after departing Rhode Island, the Patriots marked the start of Super Bowl Week with a clear mission. Preparation now takes priority as New England sets up camp at Stanford University, one week out from the NFL’s biggest stage.This return carries weight. It is the Patriots’ first Super Bowl appearance since 2019 and their 12th overall, more than any team in league history. Head coach Mike Vrabel and quarterback Drake Maye led a focused group into a cloudy Bay Area afternoon, fully aware that another Lombardi Trophy would further strengthen a legacy already etched into NFL lore.The Patriots will face the Seattle Seahawks at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, a matchup that revives memories of Super Bowl XLIX. That game ended with Malcolm Butler’s goal line interception, sealing one of the most dramatic finishes the sport has seen. This time, Seattle enters favored by 4.5 points, seeking redemption against a franchise that has so often denied it.New England’s path back to the Super Bowl has been anything but routine.After consecutive 4 and 13 seasons, the Patriots authored a remarkable turnaround. They eliminated the Los Angeles Chargers in the Wild Card round, shut down the Houston Texans and their top ranked defense in the Divisional round, then stunned the Denver Broncos on the road in the AFC Championship Game. The run restored belief inside a locker room that blends youth with championship expectations.The Patriots’ Super Bowl history reads like a timeline of the modern NFL. From their first title in Super Bowl XXXVI to back to back wins in Super Bowls XXXVIII and XXXIX, New England defined an era. They later added unforgettable moments, including a last second win over Seattle in Super Bowl XLIX and the largest comeback ever against Atlanta in Super Bowl LI. A sixth title came in Super Bowl LIII, tying the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most championships all time.Health will be closely monitored this week. Maye is managing a shoulder issue, while Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold has dealt with an oblique injury. Neither is expected to miss the game. With both teams intact, Super Bowl LX shapes up as a defining test of resilience, preparation and legacy.","The New England Patriots arrived in San Jose, California on Sunday.

McCarthy amid quarterback debate and Seahawks success (Getty Images)

Justin Jefferson subtly weighs in on Vikings quarterback decision as Sam Darnold dominates with Seahawks



Sam Darnold sits at the center of a debate Minnesota never planned to revisit, yet Justin Jefferson brought it roaring back into focus. The Vikings star wide receiver openly questioned whether the franchise’s recent direction at quarterback cost them a Super Bowl chance, and his words cut through a season filled with uncertainty and missed margins. When asked if Minnesota could have gone further with Darnold still in purple, Jefferson offered no hesitation, only clarity.""Yeah, for sure. Definitely,"" Jefferson said in a recent interview with USA Today.That answer lands heavily in a city still processing a 9-8 finish, a playoff miss, and the stunning firing of general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah just months after his extension. Meanwhile, Darnold is preparing for Super Bowl LX, thriving in Seattle, far removed from the stopgap role he once held in Minnesota.The question of why Minnesota moved on from Sam Darnold starts with timing and ends with consequence. Darnold arrived as insurance while rookie J.J. McCarthy recovered from knee surgery. When McCarthy went down for the season, Darnold steadied the offense, delivered over 4,300 passing yards, tossed 35 touchdowns, earned a Pro Bowl nod, and guided the Vikings to a 14-3 record in 2024. It was the most complete stretch of his career and one of the league’s most efficient offenses.Still, the long-term plan never shifted. Minnesota handed the offense to McCarthy in 2025, and the stability vanished. Injuries and uneven play forced Carson Wentz and rookie Max Brosmer into extended action. The offense slipped from ninth to 26th in scoring. Even a late five-game surge could not erase earlier damage, and the Vikings fell short when the stakes peaked.Jefferson framed the issue as familiarity, not blame.""Everyone knows the difficulty of the quarterback position this year, of how we were dealt it,"" Jefferson said. ""But having a quarterback that already had a season under his belt with us, knew the plays, knew the playbook, knew the players -- throwing to me, Jordan Addison, T.J. Hockenson, all these guys -- I definitely feel like we would have done better. But it is what it is. It's on to new and better things, but I'm definitely happy and proud for him that he was able to reach it this year. ""Seattle chose continuity. The Seahawks signed Darnold to a three-year deal, watched him earn another Pro Bowl selection, and rode that trust to a franchise-record 14 wins. After the NFC Championship, Darnold deflected praise toward his teammates.“It’s amazing, to be able to do it with these guys though, in this locker room, with this coaching staff, that’s why it means the world to me,” Darnold said. “I take it one day at a time, every single day, and like I said, to be able to do it with these guys out here, this locker room, it’s a special group, and I wouldn’t want to do it with anyone else.”For Jefferson, watching that success stings, even as pride outweighs regret.""It's definitely tough. It's tough to watch,"" Jefferson said. ""I love that he's in the Super Bowl. I'm happy for him, I want nothing but the best for him, especially the way his journey was at first, people doubting him and people not giving him the respect. Now they're giving him the respect. Now they're seeing that he's a top-tier quarterback in this league. Of course, selfishly I wish he had done that for us last year, but to see him blossom and bounce back right after last year and make it this year, I'm happy for him and I hope he wins. ""Seattle enters Super Bowl LX as 4.5-point favorites over New England. Minnesota, meanwhile, is left with an answer it never wanted to hear spoken aloud.","Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson appears to back Sam Darnold over J.J. McCarthy.

Tom Brady shares his own list of NFL 2025 season awards



Tom Brady 2025 NFL awards list explains his bold Coach of the Year vision



Tom Brady's 2025 NFL awards list dropped like a midweek shockwave across the league, not because of controversy, but because of conviction. The Fox Sports analyst and Las Vegas Raiders minority owner publicly shared his personal ballot for the season’s biggest honors, offering rare insight into how the greatest quarterback of his era sees today’s NFL hierarchy.What stood out immediately was not star power alone, but intent. Brady’s choices blended dominance, timing, and trust in players who shaped winning moments. His list ignored consensus thinking in spots and leaned into performance over popularity, which explains why fans and insiders alike paused to look twice. Matthew Stafford topped Brady’s Player of the Year list, a nod that mirrored the Rams quarterback’s command of the season.Stafford’s case hardly needed decoration. He was sharp, durable, and decisive when it mattered most. Brady doubled down by making it clear that if he holds an MVP vote again, Stafford would be his pick, just as Brady backed Lamar Jackson last year before Josh Allen won.The Offensive Player of the Year selection came split between Rams receiver Puka Nacua and Seahawks wideout Jaxon Smith-Njigba. It was a rare dual honor that highlighted how both players redefined their offenses in different ways.Defense brought less debate. Myles Garrett earned Defensive Player of the Year after rewriting the single-season sacks record, a milestone Brady treated as automatic.Rookie awards added intrigue. Carolina receiver Tetairoa McMillan took Offensive Rookie of the Year, while Seattle defensive back Nick Emmanwori edged out favorite Carson Schwesinger for Defensive Rookie of the Year, a pick that raised eyebrows and conversations.Brady’s most unconventional move came with Coach of the Year. Instead of one name, he chose four. Mike Vrabel led the group after guiding New England from 4-13 to a 14-3 record, an AFC title, and a Super Bowl 60 appearance. Brady’s praise carried humor and history.“They go from 4-13 to playing in the Super Bowl. Vrabes, you’re like my brother. I love you. I’m so proud of you,” Brady said in the video posted to X by FOX Sports. “Even though you went to Ohio State. ... You became a great teammate of mine and a Super Bowl champion. And not to mention a great goal line — and I’m just going to mention the goal line receiver that you were. You didn’t do anything outside the 1-yard line. So you’re not that good of a receiver, but you’re a hell of a coach. ""Chicago’s Ben Johnson, Seattle’s Mike Macdonald, and Jacksonville’s Liam Coen joined Vrabel on Brady’s list, all finalists alongside Kyle Shanahan. The only lingering question is philosophical. Should a minority owner hold an awards vote at all? Brady’s list did not answer that, but it certainly fueled the debate.","Tom Brady's 2025 NFL awards list dropped like a midweek shockwave across the league.

Justin Herbert’s quiet pre-Grammy appearance sets off fan speculation

The photo was supposed to be glamorous. Instead, it became a Rorschach test for NFL fans still processing another Chargers playoff exit. When Justin Herbert appeared at a pre-Grammy gala alongside his girlfriend, Madison Beer, one frozen moment hijacked the internet’s attention.Herbert stood still, face unreadable. Beer smiled. That contrast was all it took. Within minutes, fans began projecting the weight of January football onto a February red carpet. For a quarterback whose season ended quietly and painfully, the image felt louder than any stat line.The Chargers had bowed out of the playoffs after a bruising loss to the Patriots, and Herbert had largely vanished from public view. His sudden reappearance, framed by flashing cameras and couture, reopened unfinished conversations fans were not ready to close.On X, speculation moved fast and without mercy. One fan wrote, “Bro probably still seeing ghost,” turning a single expression into a postseason diagnosis. Another added, “That's tough. Playoff loss stings,” echoing a familiar ache shared by franchises that live close to contention but not quite past it. ""Herbert a fraud,"" another commented.The commentary sharpened from there. “If you combined Justin Herbert and Josh Allen into one Super QB they'd still have 0 Super Bowl appearances,” a third post read, dragging legacy debates into a moment that had nothing to do with football.Yet not every reaction leaned cynical. Some fans pushed back on the armchair psychology. “Justin won even after losing,” one wrote, reframing the night as a personal milestone rather than a professional failure. Another disagreed bluntly. “No, he isn't.” A final voice offered a simpler explanation. “He's not, he just hates cameras.”The divide says more about the fan base than the quarterback. Herbert finished the season with strong numbers and no shortage of expectations. Until those expectations meet postseason results, every glance will be analyzed.For now, the image remains just that. A still photo. Everything else is noise fans bring with them, shaped by hope, frustration, and a season that ended too soon for Los Angeles Chargers supporters.","Justin Herbert’s quiet pre-Grammy appearance sets off fan speculation online.

Bill Belichick to be celebrated with private summer party after Hall of Fame snub

The Hall of Fame spotlight may have shifted elsewhere this summer, but inside Bill Belichick’s inner circle, the response has been anything but quiet. As disbelief rippled through the NFL after the legendary coach failed to earn first-ballot induction, a different kind of headline began forming away from Canton.Rather than dwell on the snub, Belichick’s girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, is planning what insiders describe as a statement celebration. The timing is deliberate. The guest list is intentional. And the message is clear. Legacy does not wait for votes.According to sources, Hudson is organizing a large summer party scheduled for the same day as the Pro Football Hall of Fame ceremony. The date is no coincidence. Many of the expected attendees had already planned to travel in support of Bill Belichick, making the gathering both symbolic and personal.“Jordon is planning to throw Bill a huge bash on the same day as the Pro Football Hall of Fame ceremony,” the insider revealed.The invitation list reads like a roll call of NFL royalty. Tom Brady, Jimmy Johnson, Bill Parcells, and others who believed Belichick’s induction was inevitable are all expected to attend. The source added that “many of the outspoken supporters from the wake of Belichick’s HOF snub” will also be present.The goal is not protest. It is perspective. “The purpose of the bash is to celebrate alongside all of his people,” the insider said.That support has been loud. Brady did not hide his frustration, saying, “I don't understand it. I mean, I was with him every day. If he's not a first-ballot Hall of Famer, there's really no coach that should ever be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, which is completely ridiculous because people deserve it.”Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes also said in a post on X, “Insane… don’t even understand how this could be possible,"" while football coach Sanders, 58, called the snub ""straight out IGNORANT,"" writing on X that Belichick is ""arguably the BEST NFL COACH TO EVER COACH THE GAME!""Belichick will not be eligible again until 2027, but the celebration suggests something bigger than timing.

Jaxson Dart girlfriend Marissa Ayers offers a rare look at life away from the spotlight

Jaxson Dart girlfriend Marissa Ayers is showing fans what life really looks like beyond the bright lights of the NFL. The New York Giants quarterback, drafted 25th overall in the 2025 NFL Draft, has faced a demanding rookie season filled with pressure and promise.What changed this week was how openly that story was shared. Ayers, a model and digital creator, posted a TikTok video that pulls back the curtain on their relationship. Instead of curated glamour, the clip leans into honesty. It answers the what and why with ease, showing how two young people navigate life together while one of them adjusts to the toughest league in football.The video arrives at a telling moment. Dart’s rookie year has been a test of patience and growth, and Ayers has been present through the grind.Her TikTok does not chase drama. It focuses on everyday scenes like shopping runs, shared meals, casual laughs with friends, and quiet travel moments. The timing matters too. Their relationship became public in early January 2026, months after they began dating in October 2025.Ayers confirmed the romance on Jan. 9, 2026, with an Instagram post captioned, “rumor has it…” Dart’s reply followed quickly and said, “in a movie w you.”The exchange felt simple yet revealing. It framed their bond as something personal, not performative.The TikTok also highlights how they use travel to reset. Short getaways, city walks, and relaxed downtime reflect a balance between Dart’s high-pressure job and normal life. In the caption, Ayers shared an unfiltered thought that resonated with fans. “I have been totally off grid but feeling like the happiest girl in the world,” she wrote. That single line captured the mood of the entire video.Ayers is no stranger to attention. Since starting on TikTok in 2018 and Instagram in 2020, she has built a following of more than two million. Brand partnerships, courtside Knicks appearances, and trips like the Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix have followed. Yet this post felt different. It stripped away polish and replaced it with warmth.For Giants fans, the video adds context to Dart’s world. It shows a quarterback grounded by someone who understands the value of quiet moments. As his career unfolds in New York, this softer side may matter more than any stat line.","New York Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart's girlfriend Marissa Ayers posted a TikTok video.

“Fix these problems”: Travis Kelce charity backlash sparks debate as expert says critics are missing the real problem,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/fix-these-problems-travis-kelce-charity-backlash-sparks-debate-as-expert-says-critics-are-missing-the-real-problem/articleshow/127841310.cms,"Travis Kelce faced intense online backlash after reports questioned how his Eighty-Seven and Running Foundation spent its funds. A nonprofit attorney argued that social media is missing the larger point, saying reporting errors and lack of expert oversight, not bad intent, fueled the issues. He stressed that athletes rely on advisors and need proper nonprofit guidance to avoid reputational damage.

Nonprofit attorney says social media is focused on the wrong problem

Public debate around athlete philanthropy often moves fast and rarely slows down for nuance. That reality collided head on with Travis Kelce in recent days, as online criticism framed his Eighty-Seven and Running Foundation as a failed charity effort. Message boards and gossip sites labeled it a scam, pushing a narrative that quickly overshadowed context, intent, and the realities of nonprofit operations tied to professional athletes.The scrutiny intensified because Kelce is not just a Super Bowl winning star for the Kansas City Chiefs but also a public figure engaged to Taylor Swift, whose charitable giving is widely praised. That contrast fueled viral outrage.But according to nonprofit experts, the loudest voices may be missing the real issue entirely.Nonprofit oversight attorney Andrew Morton stepped in to reframe the conversation, pushing back on what he described as an incomplete public narrative. “I’m Andrew Morton. I wanted to jump into the fray with respect to all the internet chatter around Travis Kelce and his foundation, Eighty-Seven and Running,” he said.Morton acknowledged the reported figures, adding, “Quick background: It was reported that according to IRS tax records, the foundation dedicated around 41 cents per dollar on charitable work and paid significant amounts of compensation to Kelce’s business managers.”However, he stressed deeper issues were being ignored. “What’s not being reported are two things. One, is that a lot of the problems don’t have to do with the amount that they were dedicating to charity. It has to do with not having an accountant who understood how to report properly so that it accurately reflected what the foundation is doing.”He also challenged the tone of online outrage. “The second thing is that I feel like social media is missing the larger point around how to fix these problems, so I just want to offer a different perspective.”Morton emphasized that athletes are not trained nonprofit executives. “Let’s be clear. Kelce’s job is to catch passes and set blocks and score touchdowns.” He added that leagues, agents, and advisors must take responsibility by surrounding players with the right experts. “Find a nonprofit expert and these problems are going to go away.”In short, the conversation may be less about bad intentions and more about poor structure. And that distinction matters.",Nonprofit attorney says social media is focused on the wrong problem.

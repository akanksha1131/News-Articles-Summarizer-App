Andy Flower reveals how he is scouting for RCB | Massive role of ILT20

NEW DELHI: India’s largest airline, IndiGo , is facing intense scrutiny after massive flight disruptions left thousands of passengers stranded — including 1983 World Cup-winning cricketer Madan Lal , whose ordeal has now gone viral.Madan, stuck for 12 hours at Mumbai airport, voiced his frustration publicly, amplifying outrage around the situation.""My flight was delayed by 12 hours from Mumbai. Nobody cares in our country for the people. The airport was like a fish market,"" he posted on X, triggering a wave of reactions from travellers facing similar chaos.The disruption stems from new pilot rest regulations which mandate 48 hours of weekly rest — 12 hours more than before — and limit night-time landings from six to two per week. IndiGo admitted to “misjudgment and planning gaps” while adjusting to the rules.More than 1,000 flights were cancelled on Friday, with CEO Pieter Elbers calling it the airline’s “most severely impacted day.” The situation remains tense, with fewer than 1,000 flights expected to be cancelled on Saturday, signalling slow improvement.In a public message, Elbers apologised and outlined the airline’s response efforts.""Firstly, customer communication and addressing your needs. For this, messages have been sent on social media. And just now, a more detailed communication with information on refunds, cancellations, and other customer support measures was sent,"" he said.IndiGo, which operates around 2,300 flights daily, anticipates “full normalisation” between December 10 and 15, though it cautioned recovery will be gradual due to the scale of operations.Meanwhile, visuals of long queues, overcrowded terminals and frustrated travellers — led by Lal’s criticism — have intensified calls for accountability and better contingency planning.""Full normalisation is expected between December 10 and 15, though IndiGo cautions that recovery will take time due to the scale of operations,"" Elbers reiterated.","More than 1,000 flights were cancelled on Friday, with CEO Pieter Elbers calling it the airline’s “most severely impacted day” The disruption stems from new pilot rest regulations which mandate 48 hours of weekly rest. 1983 World Cup- winning cricketer Madan Lal's ordeal has now gone viral.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125798855,imgsize-68326,width-400,resizemode-4/indigo-0612-sds.jpg"

‘Hardik will decide India’s World Cup fate’

Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has offered a blunt explanation for Rinku Singh ’s surprise exclusion from India’s T20I squad for the upcoming five-match series against South Africa.Just months ago, Rinku grabbed headlines for calmly striking the winning boundary in the Asia Cup final against Pakistan. He was also part of the Indian squad that toured Australia for the T20I series, but persistent rain in Brisbane meant he never even got a chance to bat in the only match he was selected for.Despite those credentials, the selectors opted for Washington Sundar instead, signalling head coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Suryakumar Yadav ’s clear inclination towards strengthening India’s all-round options.Pathan said Rinku’s omission was inevitable the moment Hardik Pandya returned from injury.“Hardik Pandya is back so Rinku Singh is out. It’s unfortunate but expected. This group is 90–95 percent of the squad India will take to the 2026 T20 World Cup,” Pathan said on his YouTube channel.Pathan also gave a detailed view of India’s T20 blueprint heading into the next World Cup. He pointed out that clarity is still needed around the pace combination, the all-round group and the three frontline spin options — Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy.According to him, India’s progress at the global event will revolve around one man.“Hardik Pandya’s role will be the most crucial for India in T20s and at the World Cup. Him and the second finisher playing alongside him will be the biggest influencers in whether India lift the trophy again,” he said.",Rinku Singh has been left out of India's T20I squad for the series against South Africa.

Alarm bells before ODI decider? India coach warns South Africa: 'We’re desperate',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-south-africa/alarm-bells-before-odi-decider-india-coach-warns-south-africa-were-desperate/articleshow/125790264.cms,"India's Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Kuldeep Yadav (PTI Photo/Kunal Patil)

Harbhajan Singh lashes out at Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma critics

Team India Assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate admitted on Friday that they are carrying a sense of desperation into the series-deciding third ODI against South Africa after a disappointing Test tour and a mixed start to the one-day leg.India were swept 2-0 in the preceding Test series, and the ODI contest now stands evenly poised at 1-1. Speaking on the eve of the final match in Vizag, ten Doeschate said the players fully understand the weight of responsibility they carry, even though the limited-overs squad features different personnel. KL Rahul ’s team opened the series with a 17-run victory in Ranchi, but South Africa levelled things with a four-wicket win in Raipur.“When results start going against you and performances fall below our standards, there is naturally a bit of desperation from a series perspective,” ten Doeschate said. “But the group is used to operating under pressure. It never really leaves this team. A bilateral decider brings its own pressure and we try to focus on our processes, work out what a good score is, and let the batting group chase that target.”The former Netherlands all-rounder also pointed out that dew has had a major say in the first two ODIs and could once again be a defining factor on Saturday.He noted that while India have improved their defence when bowling second, adjusting to the conditions remains crucial.“The dew is huge here. It’s not something we can control, but it’s on us to adapt. This is a high-scoring ground with small boundaries, and the real challenge is managing the difference between batting first and chasing,” he said.Asked whether the 1.30 pm start could reduce the dew’s influence, ten Doeschate agreed that the idea had merit but conceded that broadcast requirements leave little room for change.He added that India have already attempted to prepare for heavier scoring demands during training, especially given how quickly totals escalate once the ball gets wet. “In the first game we revised our thinking from 320 to around 350. Even with the ball coming on nicely, getting to that score took a big effort,” he said. “You always want more runs. We have spoken a lot about how to maximise totals, even when conditions don’t make it easy. The responsibility is to find solutions.”","Assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate says India are carrying a sense of desperation into the series-deciding third ODI against South Africa.

NEW DELHI: Out-of-favour India pacer Mohammed Shami delivered another strong performance in domestic cricket, taking 4 for 13 to help Bengal beat Services by seven wickets in a Group C match of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy in Hyderabad on Thursday.This was Bengal’s fourth win in five matches in the tournament. The team, led by Abhimanyu Easwaran, moved to the top of the points table with 16 points and is in a good position to reach the knockouts.Easwaran, who is also trying to strengthen his case ahead of the IPL auction, scored 58 off 37 balls. Bengal chased 166 in 15.1 overs. Abhishek Porel, representing Delhi Capitals in the IPL, scored 56 off 29 balls. The pair added 93 runs for the second wicket in 8.2 overs, which set up the chase.The platform was created by Shami, who was named Player of the Match for his figures of 4/13 in 3.2 overs, and India pacer Akash Deep, who took 3/27. Services were bowled out for 165 in 18.2 overs.Shami picked two wickets in his first spell, dismissing openers Gaurav Kocchar (0) and Ravi Chauhan (26 off 9). Mukesh Kumar, on his return, gave away 53 runs in three overs. Writtick Chatterjee (2/32) and Akash Deep removed key middle-order batters before Shami ended the innings by taking the final wickets.Shami’s strong domestic performance comes when India’s pace-bowling options for the South Africa series are being discussed. Prasidh Krishna conceded 85 runs in the second ODI, even though he took two wickets, which led to debate about Shami’s absence. Harbhajan Singh also questioned the decision.""Where is Shami? I don't know why Shami is not playing. I get it, you have Prasidh, he is a good bowler, but he still has a lot to learn. You had good bowlers, and you have slowly sidelined them. With Bumrah, this is a different bowling attack, and without Bumrah, it is entirely different attack altogether.

WPL Auction 2026: Full Breakdown of Every Major Number

NEW DELHI: MS Dhoni 's impact at Chennai Super Kings has long been hailed for its calmness, loyalty and unmatched leadership — but former CSK star Mike Hussey has now lifted the curtain on a lesser-known side of the franchise: the off-field bonding culture built around Dhoni's open-door hospitality.In a fascinating revelation on The Overlap Cricket podcast, Hussey said Dhoni's room effectively became CSK's unofficial team lounge during every IPL season. Players drifted in and out at all hours, discussing cricket, bantering, sharing meals — and for some, unwinding with shisha.“Dhoni is just the most amazing guy. His room is available open 24 hours a day. Anyone can go up there and just sit. He has got his lounge room, players just sit around, they start talking cricket, some of them like the shisha, you know, the flavoured tobacco stuff. That is their way of socialising. Credit to Dhoni, he opens his room up — lots of players go up, they bring food up, it is fantastic,” Hussey said, offering a glimpse into the camaraderie that defined CSK's IPL dynasty.The anecdote echoes former CSK batter George Bailey 's earlier revelation that Dhoni often hosted relaxed hookah sessions to help younger players settle into the team.Bailey had said Dhoni's informal approach broke down hierarchy and helped create a sense of belonging — a trademark CSK value over the years.Hussey also shared a surprising detail about Dhoni's preparation habits: despite being one of the game's greatest wicketkeepers, he almost never practised the skill in training.“I think the only time I've seen him catch a ball was when we wanted to knock in a new pair of gloves. I've never seen him practise his keeping ever. But he bats a long, long time — he hits thousands and thousands of balls,” Hussey revealed.With Dhoni set to return for IPL 2026 after being retained by the five-time champions, stories like these underline why CSK players past and present continue to call the franchise a “family” — one built on trust, comfort and a legend whose door was literally always open.",Mike Hussey reveals MS Dhoni's open-door hospitality at Chennai Super Kings.

Kobe Bryant childhood friend claims NBA star didn’t help family or friends





A new claim is stirring conversation about Kobe Bryant ’s personal life. An alleged childhood friend of the late NBA legend has said that Kobe “wasn’t a good person” and “didn’t help his own family and friends.” While these allegations are gaining attention online, it’s important to look at the full picture. Kobe Bryant was a complex individual; fiercely driven, sometimes distant, but also known for acts of generosity and mentorship throughout his life.According to the report, the alleged friend says he asked Kobe for help during a difficult period, hoping for support or opportunities. The friend claims Kobe promised to assist but never followed through, leaving him disappointed. The person also alleged that Kobe didn’t support members of his family financially or personally, despite his reported $500 million fortune. These statements are entirely the friend’s perspective and have not been independently verified.Kobe himself admitted in interviews that he was not always a great friend, explaining that his relentless focus on basketball and career left him little time for personal relationships.He had strained ties with some family members and was known to be selective about where he invested his personal energy. At the same time, Kobe had a reputation for helping others outside of his immediate circle. He participated in numerous charity projects, mentored young athletes, and even helped strangers in unexpected situations, showing a more generous side of his personality.The news has sparked a mix of reactions online. Some fans expressed sympathy for the childhood friend, acknowledging that public figures can sometimes neglect personal relationships. Others defended Kobe, citing his generosity, mentorship, and larger contributions to the basketball community. Social media is buzzing with debates, highlighting how complex and multifaceted Kobe’s legacy remains.Kobe Bryant was an intensely driven athlete and a global icon. Public figures often have conflicting personal and public personas, one person’s negative experience doesn’t define the entirety of a life or legacy. While the alleged friend’s claims suggest disappointment and a sense of betrayal, there are numerous verified stories of Kobe’s generosity and mentorship. His legacy continues to inspire millions, even as these new allegations spark discussion.The allegations from Kobe Bryant’s alleged childhood friend highlight one perspective of the basketball star’s personal relationships, but they do not define his full story. Kobe’s life included both challenges in personal connections and countless acts of generosity, mentorship, and inspiration that impacted people around the world. His journey was complex, shaped by ambition, pressure, triumph, and personal growth. As fans and observers, it’s important to consider multiple perspectives and remember that a legacy is rarely simple especially for someone as high-profile, influential, and intensely driven as Kobe Bryant.Also read - Klay Thompson names his boat “SS Stallion” after Megan Thee Stallion — fans lose their minds","Kobe Bryant’s alleged childhood friend claims NBA star didn’t help family or friends.

Still have doubts? Virat Kohli blows World Cup trumpet with another masterclass

Poll Who do you think is primarily responsible for India's decline in Test cricket? Players Team Management Both equally External Factors

NEW DELHi: Former head coach Ravi Shastri has delivered one of his most pointed critiques yet of India's dramatic fall in Test cricket, declaring that both players and the team management must take responsibility for the decline. The former India head coach, who oversaw the team's successful run alongside Virat Kohli, said he is deeply hurt by the sight of a side that once dominated home and away now suffering whitewashes against New Zealand and South Africa at home.Shastri, speaking to Prabhat Khabar in a podcast teaser, was visibly frustrated while recalling India's collapse in the Guwahati Test. “You tell me. What happened in Guwahati – from 100/1, you skip to 130/7? This team is not that bad either. They have this much talent at least. The players should take some responsibility too. You have played spin since you started playing cricket,” he said.Asked whether he was defending new head coach Gautam Gambhir , Shastri was blunt. “I'm not protecting [him]. One hundred per cent he is responsible too. When am I saying anything otherwise?” he said.Then came his most striking comment. “Agar yeh mere saath hota, main pehla responsibility leta (Had this happened with me, I would have been the first one to take responsibility). But then, I wouldn't have spared the players either in the team meeting.”The frustration stems from high standards Shastri's own tenure had set. Between 2017 and 2021, India became the world's best travelling Test side, winning two historic series in Australia, staying No. 1 for 42 months and losing only two matches at home under Kohli.While Rahul Dravid revived the team after a slow start, leading India to home series wins and a second WTC final, that trajectory has stalled under Gambhir.

A decade-long wait ends

BRISBANE: Joe Root finally broke his long-awaited century jinx in Australia on Thursday, but the loudest sigh of relief didn’t come from England’s dressing room — it came from Matthew Hayden’s house. And more specifically, from his daughter, Grace.Root’s fluent 135 on Day 1 of the pink-ball Ashes Test at the Gabba not only ended 10 years of Australian heartbreak but also saved Hayden from fulfilling a bizarre promise. The former Australia opener had jokingly vowed to “walk naked around the MCG” if Root failed to score a hundred this series.The moment Root reached three figures off Scott Boland, social media exploded — and Hayden’s daughter stole the spotlight with a cheeky Instagram story. Posting a selfie, Grace wrote: “Root, thank you, you’ve saved all our eyes.” The hilarious post instantly went viral, turning Root’s milestone into an internet spectacle.Hayden himself quickly posted a congratulatory video shared by England Cricket on X, laughing at his own wager while praising Root’s perseverance.""Congratulations mate on a hundred here in Australia. Took you a while and there was no one that had more skin in the game than me, literally.I was backing you for a hundred in a good way. So congratulations, ten fifties and finally a hundred. You little ripper mate. Have a beauty and bloody enjoy it,"" Hayden joked.Root’s ton was his first in Australia after 16 matches, 30 innings, and four Ashes tours. He brought calm to a tense English innings and climbed to 40 Test hundreds — just one behind Ricky Ponting (41) and trailing only Sachin Tendulkar (51) and Jacques Kallis (45).At stumps, England were 325/9, with Root unbeaten on 135 and Jofra Archer on 32.While Australia dropped regular captain Pat Cummins again and shockingly benched Nathan Lyon for Michael Neser, it was Root’s history-making innings — and Grace Hayden’s viral punchline — that ruled the day.For Root, it was a career milestone.

Bowling isn’t threatening

VIZAG: A wave of excitement has gripped this port city on the eve of the series-deciding third One-day International between India and South Africa. With the three-match series locked one-all, a lot is at stake at the ACA-VDCA Stadium on Saturday. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli’s presence has added to the excitement as this could probably be their final dance on these shores.While Kohli is back at his fluent best, scoring back-to-back centuries in the first two ODIs, it will be a homecoming of sorts for Rohit, whose mother hails from this city. Rohit too has a hundred and two fifties in his last four outings.India recorded a nervy 17-run win in the first ODI, defending a 350-run target, thanks largely to Kohli’s record 52nd ODI ton. They had to survive Marco Jansen’s (70) and Corbin Bosch’s (67) onslaught to go 1-0 up.However, South Africa bounced back in style, successfully chasing a joint-highest 359-run target against the hosts in the second ODI to draw level with a four-wicket win.This was despite Kohli’s 84th international ton and Ruturaj Gaikwad’s maiden century. The visitors rode on a brilliant 98-ball 110 from Aiden Markram that set up the chase before the consistent Matthew Breetzke’s 68 and Dewald Brevis’ 34 ball 54 put paid to India’s hopes.India will once again look to Rohit and Kohli to fire here, since opener Yashasvi Jaiswal has got starts but is yet to fire. His weakness against left-arm quicks has been exploited by pacers Jansen and Nandre Burger in this series. That he’s succumbed to the cut shot off left-armers on 30 occasions (9 in Tests, 19 in T20Is and 2 in ODIs) is a problem the think-tank should fix, especially with a special ist opener Gaikwad in the mix.Gaikwad adapted well at No. 4 while skipper KL Rahul is in good touch, having hit back-to-back fifties. However, India have failed to find a finisher who can boost the total with those crucial 20-30 extra runs in the end that always prove vital. Washington Sundar and Ravindra Jadeja need to excel in that role. India also have the exciting option of fielding Tilak Varma or Rishabh Pant in place of Washington.The bowling department looks less threatening in the absence of Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj. Arshdeep Singh has been impressive but Prasidh Krishna has been found wanting. To be fair to them, the pacers have had to bowl with a lot of dew around, making things difficult for them. On both occasions, India lost the toss and had the disadvantage of bowling with the wet ball. Prasidh has conceded 133 runs in 15.4 overs while questions are being raised over role clarity for all rounder Washington, who bowled only seven overs in two matches.Meanwhile, the South African batting lineup is brimming with confidence after the last win. Though Quinton de Kock is yet to find form, Markram, captain Temba Bavuma, Brevis and a consistent Breetzke pose a serious threat. The abilities of Jansen and Bosch with the bat only compounds the problems for the hosts. Having already suffered an embarrassing 0-2 loss in the Test series, it is imperative that the hosts win the ODI series to keep the outside noise at bay.The last time India lost both the Test and ODI series in a bilateral tour was in South Africa in 2021-22. At home, India haven’t lost both the series of a tour since Pakistan won 1-0 in Tests and 5-1 in ODIs in 1986-87. With the batter-friendly conditions and dew in the evening, the toss will once again be crucial. India have won seven of their 10 ODIs here since 2005 but the last one against Australia ended in defeat.","The third One-day International between India and South Africa is on Saturday.

#KKR #IPL2026 trades, retentions, releases, squad update: Are they missing Gambhir?

Why KKR released Russell

A long, emotional relationship

How the ‘Power Coach’ role was born

Kolkata Knight Riders CEO Venky Mysore has opened up on the dramatic behind-the-scenes process that led to Andre Russell being released from the squad and immediately offered a brand-new role as the franchise’s “Power Coach” for IPL 2026 — an idea he says was born in an instant and finalised after discussions with team owner Shah Rukh Khan.Russell, who retired from the IPL on 30 November, will now join KKR’s support staff even as he continues featuring in T20 leagues around the globe. During his illustrious IPL run, the Jamaican powerhouse played 140 matches, smashed 2,651 runs with 12 fifties, collected 123 wickets, and won two MVP awards (2015, 2019). He was a key part of KKR’s title wins in 2014 and 2024.Speaking to ESPNcricinfo, Mysore revealed that the decision was not purely cricketing but heavily influenced by the auction rules. Though Russell’s contract value was ₹12 crore, retaining him would have cost KKR a purse deduction of ₹18 crore, since he was the franchise’s “Player 1” ahead of the previous season. Releasing him immediately added that full amount back to the purse for the upcoming mini-auction.Mysore admitted that the choice was emotionally tough, calling it “strange” for both sides as Russell had never been sent back to the auction pool before.The all-rounder, he said, was hit with the realisation only days later, even confessing to “sleepless nights” after the initial discussion.The CEO also noted that Russell, who will be 38 when IPL 2026 begins, had privately started thinking about life after playing professional cricket. When Mysore shared this with SRK , the KKR owner encouraged the idea of retirement, saying it might be the right time for Russell to transition.Mysore revealed the depth of their bond, joking that over 11 years he had probably spoken to Russell “more than to my own wife.” The franchise backed him through his highs and lows — including a year-long anti-doping suspension in 2017, during which KKR even sent support staff to help him train and stay mentally strong.Despite age and injuries slowing him in recent seasons, Mysore praised Russell’s unmatched athleticism and recalled moments of sheer power, including sixes that crashed into the sight screen.Mysore said the idea emerged spontaneously while discussing Russell’s next chapter. They settled on a role that mirrors the traits that made him one of the IPL’s most feared cricketers — finishing games, bowling as an enforcer, and fielding with raw explosiveness.“What you gave us was power,” Mysore told Russell — therefore, “Power Coach” felt like the perfect title.Russell instantly loved it, revealing that the role gave him a sense of purpose and excitement. His new job will also involve mentoring players who take up similar responsibilities in the side, sharing insights into his mindset — including how he calculated six-hitting possibilities when walking into tense chases.Mysore believes the transition suits both the franchise and Russell, concluding that the former star is now “completely at peace” with his decision and ready to give back in a new avatar.",Andre Russell retired from the IPL on 30 November.

The Indian cricket team faces a do-or-die clash as they take on South Africa in the third and final ODI on Saturday, December 6, with the series currently tied 1-1. All eyes will be on Virat Kohli , who has been in sensational form with back-to-back centuries in the series.KL Rahul, leading the side in the absence of injured Shubman Gill, guided India to a 17-run victory in the series opener. However, the Proteas bounced back in the second ODI in Raipur, winning by four wickets despite strong knocks from Kohli and Ruturaj Gaikwad.Ahead of the decider in Visakhapatnam, India might make a few changes. Washington Sundar , who struggled with both bat and ball in the first two games, could make way for Rishabh Pant, providing India with more finishing fire in the death overs. Alternatively, Tilak Varma could get his chance, having not featured so far.On the bowling front, in-form Nitish Kumar Reddy may replace Prasidh Krishna, who leaked 80 runs in 8.2 overs in the second ODI, making him India’s most expensive bowler. Reddy’s inclusion could strengthen India’s lower-order batting and give KL Rahul the option of a third seamer, while also adding a local touch to the squad.This series decider promises to be a thrilling contest, with India aiming to seal the series at home while South Africa looks to snatch victory in Vizag.","India take on South Africa in the third and final ODI on Saturday, December 6.

Harbhajan Singh lashes out at Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma critics

Former India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has called on head coach Gautam Gambhir to provide Washington Sundar with clear direction ahead of the third and final ODI against South Africa in Vizag. The three-match series has seen Sundar struggle to make any meaningful impact, raising fresh concerns over how the team management intends to use him.Sundar has been shuffled around the batting order in the first two games, walking in at No.5 in the series opener before being pushed down to No.6 in the second match. The uncertainty has been reflected in his returns: scores of 13 and 1, and a combined seven overs with the ball, without a wicket. His limited involvement has added to the debate surrounding his place in the XI.Ashwin , speaking on his YouTube channel, said Sundar needs to be handled as a primary bowler who can contribute with the bat, not the other way around.“Once you decide to play Washington Sundar, you must treat him as a bowler who can bat,” Ashwin said. “He needs to get his full set of overs. Only then will he think like a bowler who can bat. If he’s just batting and bowling a few overs, he’ll keep searching for who he is. Don’t leave him in that space. Give him proper role clarity.”Ashwin also highlighted India’s lack of finishing power with the bat. Despite being 284 for 4 after 40 overs in the second ODI, India ended with only 358.He questioned whether the team might be better served with a fast-bowling all-rounder such as Nitish Kumar Reddy in Sundar’s place.“India haven’t finished well in both games,” he said. “Without someone like Hardik Pandya, why wasn’t a powerful finisher like Nitish Kumar Reddy tried? I’m not sure if they see Rishabh Pant as a finisher. India are missing that punch at the end. Should a fast-bowling all-rounder play instead of a spinning one?”Ashwin added that, with India’s bowling resources depleted, this team may regularly need an extra 30–40 runs to feel safe, particularly if Jasprit Bumrah is not available.“We’ve lost many experienced bowlers in Tests and white-ball cricket,” he said. “The X-factor is Bumrah. If he isn’t a full-time part of the squad, India must score 30 to 40 extra every match.","Ravichandran Ashwin has called on head coach Gautam Gambhir to provide Washington Sundar with clear direction ahead of the third and final ODI against South Africa.

Australia tightened their grip on the second Ashes Test in Brisbane, finishing Day 2 with a handy 44-run lead after powering their way to 378 for 6 under the lights at the Gabba. Jake Weatherald and Steve Smith set the tone with composed half-centuries, ensuring the hosts surged past England’s first-innings 334 in front of a lively crowd on a humid evening. The advantage could prove vital with the pitch expected to wear as the match moves into its later stages.Alex Carey survived two early chances to remain unbeaten on 46 at stumps, while Michael Neser closed the day on 15. England’s seamers caused some trouble under the lights, yet the visitors lacked consistency and paid for a series of loose balls and dropped catches.

He cracked 12 fours and a six in a brisk innings before Jofra Archer pinned him lbw with a clever yorker. Marnus Labuschagne continued his strong run of domestic and international form, striking 65 before edging Ben Stokes to wicketkeeper Jamie Smith.Australia were comfortably placed at 291 for 3 when Brydon Carse sparked an unexpected swing in momentum. In the space of four deliveries, the fast bowler removed Cameron Green for 45 and then delivered a huge moment for England by dismissing Smith on 61. Will Jacks held the catch at backward square after Smith miscued a hook shot.Travis Head, who blasted a match-winning century in Perth during the first Test, was far more controlled this time. He scored 33 before falling to Gus Atkinson via Carse’s bowling late in the afternoon session.England began the day at 325 for 9 and were dismissed within minutes of play resuming. Joe Root added nine more runs to finish unbeaten on 138, completing a superb innings that rescued England after they collapsed to 5 for 2 on Day 1. Jofra Archer’s spirited 38 ended when Labuschagne completed a diving catch in the deep to wrap up the innings. Mitchell Starc led Australia’s bowling effort with 6 for 75.Weatherald launched Australia’s reply with a flurry of attractive drives as the fast outfield rewarded clean striking. He reached fifty from just 45 deliveries, capitalising on England’s erratic lines before Archer’s yorker ended his stay.Labuschagne picked up where the opener left off, pushing Australia forward with another polished half-century featuring ten boundaries. Smith then kept the scoreboard moving, bringing up his 44th Test fifty with a range of well-timed strokes.

Rajasthan Royals trade, releases, IPL squad retention: Crucial auction for Sanju Samson-less RR

With Sanju Samson ’s stunning trade to Chennai Super Kings ahead of IPL 2025, Rajasthan Royals suddenly find themselves searching for a new leader. And the name at the top of the list is Riyan Parag , who captained RR in eight matches last season when Samson was injured.Riyan is aware that he is one of the frontrunners, but the 24-year-old insists he isn’t letting the captaincy talk cloud his head. “I captained in seven to eight matches in the IPL last season. In the dressing room, when we would analyse decisions, I have done things right 80 to 85 per cent,” he said in an interaction with Sportstar.He added that the Royals management has not finalised anything yet. “Manoj [Badale] sir has said the decision [on captaincy] will be taken after the auction. If I think about that now, I will ruin my mental space. If the team management feels I am the right fit for captaincy, I am ready to put my hand up. If they feel that, as a player, I can contribute more, I am ready for that also.”Riyan also opened up on the unseen workload that comes with leadership in the IPL. “Everyone has the misconception that captaincy is easy. Yes, there is an element of fame in captaincy, but it reduces the element of cricket to 20 per cent.You have to attend all the meetings, attend sponsor shoots, and answer the media. I need to develop these things as a person.”As he gears up to join the senior leadership group of the Royals, Riyan admitted that Samson’s exit will leave a void on and off the field.“I don’t want to think about his [Samson’s] absence, because then I will feel bad. I was very close to Sanju bhaiya when I came into the team. He never let me feel that I was a 17 or 18-year-old boy from Assam. He also came from that background, at 16-18, and helped me the way he would have been helped at that time. In the last two years, he would give me vice-captaincy in Jos bhai’s absence. He would ask me to talk to the bowlers and attend team meetings, and take the lead. ”Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings pulled off one of the biggest trades in IPL history, sending Samson to CSK in exchange for Ravindra Jadeja and Sam Curran .Samson had been retained for INR 18 crore, and he joins CSK on the same fee. CSK had kept Jadeja for INR 18 crore earlier, but his fee has now been reset to INR 14 crore as part of the trade. Curran’s 2.4-crore deal remains unchanged.",Riyan Parag captained Rajasthan Royals in eight matches last season. The 24-year-old is one of the frontrunners to replace Sanju Samson.

NEW DELHI: Twelve Indian Super League (ISL) clubs have approached the All India Football Federation (AIFF) with urgent concerns about the domestic football crisis.

This revenue stream has historically been the principal source of income that enabled clubs to manage salaries, infrastructure, and sporting operations.""With the expiry of the MRA and the consequent absence of a commercial rights holder, central revenue has ceased entirely.The uncertainty has also caused local sponsors to withdraw or pause commercial commitments, leaving clubs with no viable income whatsoever, despite ongoing obligations.""The clubs have recommended that AIFF collaborate with the government to address these issues. They suggest submitting proposed actions to sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya before December 8 to inform the Supreme Court about remedial measures.""... time is now of the essence. The viability of the clubs and indeed the future of the ISL and the Indian football ecosystem depends on immediate steps being placed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. It is, therefore, imperative that the report of the Union of India and/or the AIFF on the actions proposed to be taken in respect of the issues highlighted herein be filed on or before 8 December 2025, so that the Court is apprised of the remedial pathway and commercial certainty can be restored without further delay,"" it added.The clubs expressed concern that any delay beyond the specified date could severely damage the football ecosystem developed over the past decade.AIFF responded by confirming they would forward the concerns to the Ministry of Sports and engage KPMG to develop solutions, including a possible re-tender.""The AIFF shall also put in all possible effort as per our AIFF Constitution to ensure ISL gets a long-term sustainable model for growth and development of Indian football.

A previous tender for selecting a new ISL commercial partner was unsuccessful.The clubs have suggested forming a consortium to operate the league if a new tender fails to attract suitable partners.""Such an approach is consistent with global best practices and reflective of the long-term commitment of the Clubs to Indian football,"" the clubs stated.""It must be conducted within a strict and non-extendable timeline, such that the process is completed well before the end of this month. Only a hard time-bound tender window of this nature provides any realistic opportunity to stabilise the commercial structure of the league and salvage the current season.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw ceremony will take place in Washington on Friday at the Kennedy Center, featuring U.S. President Donald Trump receiving the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize. The ceremony, starting at 1700 GMT, will include American sports stars and entertainment celebrities for the first-ever 48-team World Cup finals to be hosted across North America from June 11 to July 19.The expanded tournament will include 16 more teams than the 2022 Qatar World Cup, making it the most logistically complex World Cup in history. The matches will be played across 16 venues, with 11 in the United States, three in Mexico, and two in Canada.FIFA President Gianni Infantino has established a close relationship with Trump, who will receive the FIFA Peace Prize during the ceremony. According to Infantino, the award is ""to recognize the enormous efforts of those individuals who unite people, bringing hope for future generations.""Trump, who recently became chairman of the Kennedy Center, has made the World Cup a centerpiece event of both his second presidency and the 250th anniversary of U.S.independence next year.

Inter Miami, led by Lionel Messi , will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the Major League Soccer championship final on Saturday at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, where four World Cup winners including Messi, Thomas Mueller, Sergio Busquets, and Rodrigo De Paul will compete for domestic glory.The 38-year-old Argentine has guided Miami through an impressive playoff run, with the team scoring 17 goals in five games.Vancouver presents a formidable challenge with German star Thomas Mueller, who joined in August, enhancing their attacking prowess.Mueller has dismissed suggestions of a personal rivalry with Messi ahead of the final.""It's not about Messi against Thomas Mueller,"" Mueller stated after Vancouver's 3-1 victory in the Western Conference final. ""It's Miami against the Whitecaps.""Miami's journey to the final appeared unlikely in April when Javier Mascherano's team managed only two wins in eight games, including a 5-1 aggregate loss to Vancouver in the CONCACAF Champions Cup.At that time, broadcast analysts criticized the team harshly: ""They can't run, they can't defend, and there's not a balance in the team.""Miami has since undergone a remarkable transformation, strengthened by De Paul's addition in midfield and Mascherano's decision to start 19-year-old Mateo Silvetti over veteran Luis Suarez.Whitecaps coach Jesper Sorensen downplayed the significance of their earlier victories against Miami.""It almost seems like it was last season, right?"" Sorensen said. ""It's a new game. It's two teams that approach the game in their way, and we will see who comes out on top come Saturday.""Messi expressed confidence about playing the final at home in a rare interview with ESPN Argentina.""We're in a very good moment, the team is solid and excited,"" Messi said. ""Playing at home is a plus. Even though we went through a stretch where we were very inconsistent and struggled to win back-to-back games, at home we always stayed strong.""Mueller, who has historically dominated encounters with Messi, winning seven out of their ten meetings, including the 2014 World Cup final and Bayern Munich's 8-2 victory over Barcelona in the 2020 Champions League.""I look back in the past and I feel very comfortable with that, because that's already in the books, and I had a lot of great experience in these games with my teams, so it was fun,"" Mueller reflected on his previous matches against Messi.

LIVERPOOL: Virgil van Dijk says Mohamed Salah 's omission from Liverpool's team for a second successive match shows no player at the club has ""unlimited credit"".

""It's not like you have unlimited credit, everyone has to perform.""Mo has been doing that but the manager made that decision in the last two games. We all want the best for the club.""I am pretty sure Mo will still be a big part of what we are trying to achieve because he is an amazing player and he has shown it consistently.""Van Dijk praised playmaker Florian Wirtz, whose shot deflected in off Sunderland defender Nordi Mukiele for a late Liverpool equaliser that left them eighth in the table.The German, who joined Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer transfer window for £116 million ($155 million), is showing encouraging signs after a tough start to life at Anfield.""There's a very good reason why a club like us bought him,"" said Van Dijk.

Leeds stun troubled Chelsea

Liverpool frustrated; Villa rise again

Arsenal tightened their grip at the top of the Premier League with a 2-0 win over Brentford on Wednesday, restoring their five-point cushion on a night that delivered shockwaves elsewhere. Chelsea slumped to a damaging 3-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Leeds, Liverpool were held again at Anfield, and Aston Villa’s remarkable rise continued with a 4-3 thriller at Brighton. Mikel Arteta ’s side were far from vintage at the Emirates Stadium but did enough to edge another step towards a first league title since 2003/04. Mikel Merino justified the decision to keep him in the starting XI ahead of a returning Viktor Gyokeres, powering in Ben White’s cross for his 11th goal of the season.“It’s unbelievable what he has done again today,” Arteta said. “The goal is magnificent — the movement, the quality, the finish… It’s phenomenal.”Bukayo Saka came off the bench on the hour mark to make sure of the win, delivering a fierce stoppage-time strike that Caoimhin Kelleher could not keep out.Leeds boss Daniel Farke entered the match under intense scrutiny after four straight defeats, but his side responded with a passionate, clinical display to climb out of the relegation zone. Jaka Bijol headed them ahead early, before Ao Tanaka lashed in a superb drive from the edge of the area.Pedro Neto offered Chelsea brief hope early in the second half, but a defensive calamity sealed their fate as Tosin Adarabioyo was dispossessed inside his box, allowing Dominic Calvert-Lewin to score. “A very poor night,” admitted Blues manager Enzo Maresca. “They deserved to win. They were better than us in all aspects.”Liverpool’s frustrations deepened as they were held 1-1 by Sunderland despite needing a late own-goal to salvage a point.

Kylie Kelce didn’t hold back when she spoke about her husband’s parenting skills during a recent event in New York City. The mother of four offered a warm and genuine glimpse into life inside the Kelce home, where questions never seem to end and patience becomes the real measure of strength. In a room filled with athletes, families and supporters of an important cause, Kylie made it clear that Jason’s quiet effort at home deserves just as much applause as his celebrated NFL career.Instead of giving a broad overview, Kylie went straight into acknowledging the everyday moments that shape their family life. Her words highlighted the kind of father Jason is when the cameras are off, especially when he sits with their daughters and answers every curious question that comes his way.Parents everywhere understand that kids rarely stop asking questions, and Kylie Kelce knows this better than most. While attending the luncheon at Cipriani 42nd Street, where Jason received the March of Dimes Sports Achievement Award, she took a moment to praise his ability to stay present with their daughters Finnley “Finn,” Bennett, Elliotte, and Wyatt. She shared that listening to the organization’s mission reminded her of how deeply Jason connects with the idea that “every family deserves support,” saying, “And after hearing more about the mission of the March of Dimes, I realized just how aligned he is with this work.The idea that every family deserves support, that every baby deserves a strong start, and that no parents should ever have to face fear or uncertainty alone.”Kylie then shifted to what life looks like behind closed doors. She said, “Jason carries [that] not just publicly but personally every day with our girls and within our community.” She added, “What most people never see are the private moments, the time he gives, the conversations he has, because there’s a lot of why in our house right now and he has the patience to answer ‘why, why, why.'”“He doesn’t do it because anyone’s watching,” Kylie said. “He does it because it’s who he is at his core. It doesn’t just make him a great athlete, but a great man.”Jason has also admitted that “being a father is by far the biggest highlight” of his life and that spending time with his daughters brings him joy every single day.Also Read: Jaxson Dart romance rumors explode as Marissa Ayers is spotted hanging out comfortably with his mom Kara","Kylie Kelce spoke about her husband Jason's parenting skills during a recent event in New York City.

Jaxson Dart dating news takes a new turn



Well it seems like the NFL’s most eligible bachelor is no longer living the single life. New York Giants heartthrob quarterback Jaxson Dart appears to be officially off the market, and the evidence is only growing stronger. The rookie quarterback who has already captured the attention of fans with his poise on the field is now making headlines for something far more personal. His rumored romance with influencer and model Marissa Ayers has shifted from speculation to something that looks very real.The pair were first linked after being spotted together at a Halloween party, a moment that sparked plenty of conversation among fans. Now there is a new photo that adds fuel to those rumors. Ayers was seen at the Giants’ Monday Night Football game against the New England Patriots, a tough 33-15 loss, standing in the crowd with Dart’s mom, Kara. She has gone viral throughout the season for her vibrant presence, and seeing Ayers by her side signals a major step. If someone is spending time with mom at a game, it usually means things are serious.NFL fans had once imagined Dart with another celebrity altogether after he openly shared that popstar Madison Beer was his celebrity crush.The quote spread quickly and led many to link the two, even though Beer is in a committed relationship with Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert. The chatter never stopped, but it now seems clear Dart has found someone outside that fantasy storyline.Kara Dart has also gained attention this season for her game day fashion and the way she supports her son. With Ayers now entering that spotlight, the excitement around upcoming Giants games is set to grow. Social media loves a rising duo, and this pairing fits the bill.Ayers, 22, is a model, influencer, and ring girl with roots in the SEC as an Alabama Crimson Tide alum. Dart’s own rise came under Lane Kiffin at Ole Miss, which gives the couple a shared southern tie that fans will surely talk about.At this point, the only step left is for Dart and Ayers to make things Instagram official. The only challenge may be choosing a photo that does not allow Kara to steal the spotlight once again.Also Read: Molly Qerim drops unexpected Instagram update, fueling fresh intrigue over her surprising ‘First Take’ departure","New York Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart has been linked to model Marissa Ayers.

Suggs suggested that Canton might delay Brown's induction until his attempted murder charge is resolved, drawing a parallel to a past controversial enshrinement. Brown's impressive on-field stats are undeniable, but his off-field conduct could significantly impact his Canton fate.

Terell Suggs hints Canton may delay Antonio Brown because of current legal turmoil

The debate around Antonio Brown’s Hall of Fame future has always felt complicated, but former Baltimore Ravens star Terrell Suggs just threw gasoline on it. While many football purists argue that Brown’s résumé, seven Pro Bowls, four First-Team All-Pro selections, historic receiving numbers, makes him one of the greatest wideouts of his era, Suggs isn’t convinced the Hall of Fame voters will overlook the chaos that followed Brown off the field.Speaking on the Prizepicks podcast, he didn’t simply question whether Brown would be a first-ballot pick; he reached back into Hall of Fame history to imply that Canton has already dealt with similar scandals and regretted it.Terell Suggs made it clear that on-field dominance alone won’t guarantee Brown walking into Canton with a gold jacket. The linebacker acknowledged Brown’s unguardable talent from his Steelers days, saying, “He tortured me during his duration in Pittsburgh… We can never really get ahold of him.” Suggs then shifted the focus to Brown’s legal situation, predicting the Hall won’t welcome him while his case remains active. “That off field, they’re going shy away from that probably until it gets resolved,” Suggs warned.Then came the bombshell comparison: “They let another murderer in the nineties. I bet you if they would’ve waited, I bet you if they could, they would’ve waited.” The remark stunned NFL fans, hinting that Suggs believes voters have learned from past mistakes and won’t rush with a controversial figure again.Brown’s case looms large over his football legacy. He faces a second-degree attempted murder charge tied to a shooting outside a Miami boxing event. After being arrested in Dubai and extradited to Florida, Brown pleaded not guilty and remains monitored with a GPS device as he awaits trial. With eligibility set for 2027, his stats scream Hall of Fame, but as Suggs asked, “Is he a first ballot guy?… We might not want to put this guy in this fraternity just yet. ”Numbers may define greatness, but in Canton, character might decide Brown’s fate.Also Read: “Mentally off”: Fans erupt after Jordon Hudson files FOIA request on behalf of Bill Belichick amid Pablo Torre controversy","Terell Suggs suggested that Canton might delay Antonio Brown's induction until his attempted murder charge is resolved.

His comments, delivered with characteristic flair, drew significant attention, overshadowing the global football event and prompting discussions about renaming the NFL.

Donald Trump’s push to rename American football adds drama to World Cup excitement

The 2026 World Cup draw had barely begun before President Donald Trump turned the global spotlight into another commentary on American sports culture. On a stage meant to celebrate nations, balls, brackets, and international football royalty, Trump instead took aim at the country’s most powerful sports league.With a grin and a dramatic pause, he questioned why the United States calls its most popular sport “football” at all, given that the rest of the world reserves that name for soccer. His comments echoed through a crowd already hyped for the country’s first co-hosted World Cup, drawing cheers and social media buzz before a single match was discussed.The President’s words landed with the kind of theatrical flair usually reserved for primetime NFL broadcasts. “When you look at football in the U.S., soccer in the U.S., we seem to never to call it that because we have a little bit of a conflict with another thing that's called football,” Trump said. “But when you think about it, shouldn't it really be called football? We have to come up with another name for the NFL.”For a nation preparing to welcome 48 teams across three host countries, Trump’s comment instantly sparked debate: is it time for the NFL to surrender the term “football,” or was this another headline-grabbing showmanship moment? For decades, Americans have defended their version of football with near-religious loyalty, especially as the league dominates television, culture, and holiday traditions.Trump’s history with the sport makes the remark even more intriguing. Reports earlier this year claimed he wanted a new Washington Commanders stadium named after himself, showing he’s no stranger to inserting personal branding into gridiron conversations. Now his playful challenge brings new attention to a World Cup already projected to break attendance and viewership records as the U.S. draws a group featuring Australia, Paraguay, and a European playoff winner.Whether his suggestion sparks genuine change or remains just another viral soundbite, Trump managed to do what the NFL itself does best: command attention, even on a global soccer stage.Also Read: “Mentally off”: Fans erupt after Jordon Hudson files FOIA request on behalf of Bill Belichick amid Pablo Torre controversy","President Donald Trump questioned why American football is called 'football' when the rest of the world uses the term for soccer.

His girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, has filed a Freedom of Information Act request against UNC. This action aims to disprove reports claiming she was barred from team facilities. The move has divided fans, with some supporting her defense and others fearing it damages Belichick's coaching transition.

Fans call Jordon Hudson “toxic” as legal tension spills into Belichick’s coaching transition

Bill Belichick’s first year at North Carolina has already come with harsh critiques, a disappointing 4–8 record, and a media feud but it’s his girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, who has unexpectedly taken center stage. The model and influencer has become a polarizing figure within Tar Heels circles after a viral report claimed she was barred from team facilities.Now, she has escalated the situation by filing a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request against UNC on Belichick’s behalf, aiming to prove that those allegations are false. The move has college football fans divided, with some applauding Hudson for defending her partner and others calling her involvement deeply damaging for the new head coach.Hudson’s FOIA request targeted UNC communications and athletic leadership, reportedly in an effort to uncover internal communication surrounding her name. The request follows reporter Pablo Torre’s claims that Hudson had behaved disruptively and was restricted from entering football facilities.Hudson responded by threatening legal action against Torre, insisting the report was fabricated. On social media, reactions were instant and vicious.One fan wrote, “B**ches be crazy. But, this b**ch is mentally off her rocker.” Another said she seemed “totally, intentionally, and indisputably toxic.”Many fans fear her actions could affect Belichick’s credibility as a college coach, especially after a rough debut season. Comments like “Someone got to rescue Bill.

Lamar Jackson injury update: Ravens fear a setback as quarterback misses practice before must-win Steelers game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/lamar-jackson-injury-update-ravens-fear-a-setback-as-quarterback-misses-practice-before-must-win-steelers-game/articleshow/125788130.cms,"Lamar Jackson's health is a major concern for the Baltimore Ravens ahead of a pivotal AFC North clash with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Jackson has missed practice due to an ankle issue, raising alarms about his availability and the team's offensive consistency. The Ravens also signed tight end Mark Andrews to a contract extension amidst this uncertainty.

Ravens weigh risk as Lamar Jackson’s slump, health concerns, and Mark Andrews contract shape the season’s future

The Baltimore Ravens are suddenly staring at a pivotal AFC North showdown without their franchise quarterback. Lamar Jackson, already navigating a season full of nagging ailments, missed practice again this week, turning a minor concern into full-blown panic ahead of Sunday’s clash against the Pittsburgh Steelers. What was initially treated as a cautious, mid-week recovery day has escalated into a major storyline that could decide the Ravens’ postseason fate.Both teams sit at 6-6, making this matchup feel more like a playoff elimination game than a regular-season meeting. Baltimore’s offense has struggled for consistency, and Jackson’s health could now determine whether the Ravens stay in the hunt, or slide toward a crisis that derails their year.Jackson was limited on Wednesday due to an ankle issue, but his absence from Thursday’s session raised alarms. The frustration extends beyond this week’s game, injuries have kept him from completing a full week of practice since Week 10, and the inconsistency is showing on the field. He has completed 64.8% of his passes for 1,841 yards, with 15 touchdowns and four interceptions, yet the bigger concern is that he has not thrown a touchdown in three straight games, marking the worst stretch of his career.If Jackson can’t suit up, Tyler Huntley would be tasked with leading Baltimore in a game that could make or break their postseason hopes. Huntley is 1-3 against Pittsburgh, and even his lone involvement in a win in 2022 came with injury concerns. The stakes couldn’t be higher: Sunday’s loser falls below .500 and faces a steep uphill battle to re-enter playoff contention.In the midst of the uncertainty, Baltimore made a surprising move by locking in one of Jackson’s most trusted targets. The team signed tight end Mark Andrews to a three-year, $39.3 million extension with $26 million guaranteed. As Adam Schefter reported, “Ravens and TE Mark Andrews reached agreement on a three-year, $39.3 million extension…”The decision signals long-term investment, but it also fuels speculation about Isaiah Likely’s future, with the young tight end set for free agency in 2026.For now, though, one question looms larger than any contract decision: Will Lamar Jackson take the field on Sunday? For the Ravens, the answer may define their season.Also Read: “A trail of blood”: Aaron Rodgers accused of emotional abuse as Danica Patrick claims he left her ‘in pieces’","Lamar Jackson missed practice on Thursday due to an ankle issue.

Drake Maye’s love story with wife Ann Michael Hudson warms NFL fans

New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye may be the NFL’s newest breakout star, but away from the tunnel and highlight reels, his love story has captured just as much attention as his clutch performances. While Maye’s 2025 season has fans and analysts praising his poise under pressure, his personal life showcases a different kind of consistency, a decade-long romance with his childhood sweetheart, Ann Michael Hudson.Their journey isn’t wrapped in celebrity spectacle or red-carpet glamour. Instead, it reflects a rare kind of loyalty that began in a small North Carolina classroom when they were just 12 years old. As Maye earns comparisons to icons like Tom Brady, it’s this grounded, real-world partnership that has NFL followers equally intrigued.Long before the NFL spotlight found him, Drake Maye and Ann Michael Hudson were just classmates navigating adolescence together. Their friendship eventually turned into love during middle school, followed by attending William A. Hough High School together. Even after Maye transferred to Myers Park, the relationship endured, strengthened by their shared college experience at the University of North Carolina.Hudson’s background fits naturally into Maye’s sports-driven world; her father played college football, while her brother, Tad Hudson, shared the field with Maye at UNC. She also built her own athletic identity through softball, cheerleading, and even serving as an assistant softball coach for young girls.Their fairytale took a meaningful step forward in January 2025 when Maye proposed in a serene beachside moment. His heartfelt caption summed up years of companionship: “Love doing life with you. Can’t wait to marry you!” The couple tied the knot on June 21, 2025, at the Grandfather Golf and Country Club in North Carolina.What truly moved fans, however, was the couple’s post-wedding choice. Rather than enjoy wedding gifts valued at nearly $100,000, they quietly donated everything to local shelters. Without fanfare or press, they sent gifts and donations directly to organizations in their hometown, inspiring admiration across the league.As Patriots supporters cheer Maye’s rise, the quarterback’s biggest win may just be the life he’s building off the field, one marked by gratitude, loyalty, and purpose.Also Read: Drake Maye’s wife Ann Michael becomes the new Patriots darling as fans poke fun at Gisele Bündchen","New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye and Ann Michael Hudson have been together for 10 years.

Justin Baldoni’s accusations highlight power struggles, influence, and an odd claim about circumcision

The drama surrounding It Ends With Us has taken a sharp, personal turn, and the fallout now stretches far beyond a film set. Director Justin Baldoni , already under scrutiny for alleged misconduct during production, is being accused of weaponizing personal narratives, even dragging global superstar Taylor Swift into his ongoing feud with Blake Lively The dispute began with on-set tension, but has evolved into a legal battle that is now headed to trial in 2026. As fan culture collides with courtroom strategy, the controversy mirrors the type of public i nfl uence that often surrounds Swift herself, a pop powerhouse whose every decision sparks headlines, and whose NFL romance with Travis Kelce continues to dominate entertainment and sports conversations alike.Court filings reveal that Baldoni feared Lively could “play the victim,” telling a friend group that if she refused to promote the film, “she can leak that I’m a bad person or that she felt unsafe with me and all the stuff she has on me. Then she’s the victim. It’s the Taylor Swift playbook.”In a separate statement, he admitted he believed Lively held a “nuclear bomb” of influence, not just through her fame, but through her high-profile circle with Swift and Ryan Reynolds, whom he referred to as her “dragons.”Beyond the power narrative, the deposition also exposed bizarre conversations Baldoni allegedly had with Lively about her baby’s circumcision and even his own.When questioned, Baldoni responded “yes” to discussing both topics, yet failed to explain why he disclosed personal details to a colleague.Lively is seeking more than $160 million in damages, claiming severe financial, business, and reputational losses. Her team insists this is “not… a story of minor annoyances,” but a toxic work environment that warrants a trial.As Swift’s name unexpectedly becomes part of this Hollywood controversy, the optics only intensify, proving the cultural weight of her brand, just as her headline-making relationship with Travis Kelce continues to demonstrate how influence in 2025 can reach far beyond one industry.Also Read: Blake Lively believes Taylor Swift will ‘come running’ back after her lawsuit win hopes it leads to a Kelce wedding invite","Director Justin Baldoni accused of weaponizing personal narratives in legal battle with Blake Lively.

Trey Hendrickson Week 14 update: Bengals edge rusher ruled out against Bills



The Cincinnati Bengals are entering a crucial stretch of the 2025 season as they try to bounce back from a 3-8 start. Their recent Thanksgiving night win over the Baltimore Ravens has given the team momentum, but they face a tough challenge this week on the road against the Buffalo Bills, a team also fighting to stay competitive this season.Joe Burrow’s performance and Cincinnati’s offense will be key in this matchup. While Burrow has a 2-0 record against Josh Allen in his career, the Bengals will need more than past results to overcome a Bills defense that is strong and well-prepared. Week 14 promises a high-stakes game for both teams.NFL insider Tom Pelissero reports that Bengals edge rusher Trey Hendrickson will not play in Sunday’s game against the Bills. Hendrickson has been sidelined since Week 8 due to a hip/pelvis injury. In seven games this season, he has recorded four sacks and three tackles for loss, making his absence a significant setback for Cincinnati’s defense. His ability to pressure opposing quarterbacks and disrupt offensive schemes will be sorely missed as the Bengals head into a critical matchup.The Bengals, currently allowing the most yards per game in the league, will need other defenders to step up and fill the void.Players like Sam Hubbard and Cameron Sample will likely see increased snaps, with pressure on the linebackers and secondary to contain Josh Allen and limit Buffalo’s big-play opportunities. The defensive line will need to generate consistent pass rush and force turnovers to give Cincinnati’s offense the chance to control the game.On the offensive side, Joe Burrow will be tasked with leading the team efficiently, balancing the passing game with strategic runs and protecting the ball. Play-calling and execution will be vital, as the Bengals cannot afford costly mistakes against a Bills team capable of quickly turning momentum in their favor.With both teams needing a win, Week 14 represents a crucial test of Cincinnati’s competitiveness this season. Every drive, every defensive stop, and every turnover could play a crucial role in shaping the outcome. How the Bengals respond to Hendrickson’s absence and adjust their game plan will likely define their performance in this matchup.Also Read: George Pickens fires back at Richard Sherman’s harsh effort criticism after Cowboys’ Week 14 loss to Lions",Bengals edge rusher Trey Hendrickson ruled out for Sunday's game against Bills.

buy out another couple’s wedding date

What the Taylor Swift wedding date snatching rumor actually claims and why fans are confused

How the Rhode Island venue responded with a denial and why the buyout story doesn’t add up

does not permit

Okay, the internet has fully lost its mind over this one. One minute, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are living their fairytale romance, and the next, the timeline is screaming that she tried toat a luxury Rhode Island venue. Like imagine waking up and hearing that Taylor Swift wants your wedding day? The rumor spread so fast that even people who don’t believe in astrology were suddenly analyzing June 13 energy. But just when the drama peaked, the venue stepped in with a big fat denial, sending fans into even more chaos.The viral rumor started with reports claiming Taylor Swift wanted June 13, 2026, a date already booked by a regular couple at a high-end Rhode Island venue. Of course, Swift’s fans immediately clocked that 13 is her number, so the theory felt almost too poetic to ignore.According to gossip outlets, Taylor allegedly offered the couple a hefty payoff to move their date so she could secure the venue for her own wedding to Travis Kelce. That alone was enough to send fans and Swift haters into a frenzy. Some people said, “Of course she did,” while others defended her like she was on trial at The Hague.The rumor spread like wildfire because it played right into the intense worldwide obsession with Swift’s private life. But as spicy as the story sounded, things got messy quickly.Once the headlines exploded, the venue in question reported to be the Ocean House in Westerly, Rhode Island stepped forward and shut the whole thing down.They said no, Taylor Swift didn’t buy out anyone’s wedding date.And no, it wouldn’t even be allowed under their contract rules.Their spokesperson stated that the venuewedding date takeovers or buyouts. Once a couple books, that date is locked. Period.So either the rumor was exaggerated, or someone in the gossip chain made a huge leap. Either way, the venue’s denial hit just as the story was reaching its peak.Honestly, the reason this blew up so dramatically is simple: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s wedding is basically a cultural event people are trying to predict.Neither Swift nor Kelce has commented.The allegedly displaced couple hasn’t spoken publicly.The venue denies the buyout rumor and no actual contract or receipt has surfaced.So for now, the “wedding date snatching” story remains pure celebrity-gossip chaos fun to watch, but not confirmed.Until Taylor or Travis actually drops real wedding details, these rumors will keep spiraling. Fans want answers, the internet wants drama, and celebrity gossip will always fill in the blanks.Also read - Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce rumored to have multi-day wedding at Rhode Island mansion: What we know so far","The viral rumor started with reports claiming Taylor Swift wanted June 13, 2026, a date already booked by a regular couple at a high-end Rhode Island venue.

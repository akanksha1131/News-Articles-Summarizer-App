Ben Stokes press conference: On handshake controversy, India fightback, his own fitness

NEW DELHI: India's head coach Gautam Gambhir has confirmed that star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant has been ruled out of the fifth and final Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy due to a foot fracture — an injury he astonishingly batted through during the fourth Test in Manchester.Pant, who retired hurt on Day 1 after being struck on the foot while attempting a reverse sweep off Chris Woakes, was seen being carted off the field in visible pain. However, in a remarkable display of grit, he returned to bat on Day 2 and scored a half-century while limping, earning widespread admiration.“It's been declared that he's out of the series,” Gambhir said after the drawn fourth Test at Old Trafford. “But one thing I want to say is that the character and the foundation of this team will be built on something Rishabh did for the team and for the country as well.”“Any amount of praise is not enough for him — especially batting with a broken foot. I think the generations to come will talk about it and the generations coming forward should talk about it.”Pant's injury reopened the debate around substitution rules in Test cricket.Though Pant was replaced behind the stumps by Dhruv Jurel, there was no provision for a full injury replacement — a rule Gambhir feels should be implemented.“Absolutely, I'm all for it,” he said. “If the umpires and match referee feel there's a major injury, it's important to have a rule that allows for a substitute. Especially in a series like this. Imagine if we had to play with just 10 players against 11 — how unfortunate would that be?”England captain Ben Stokes, however, was firm in opposition. “I think it is absolutely ridiculous that there is a conversation around injury replacements,” he said. “You pick your 11 for the game, injuries are part of it. That conversation should be shut down.”Pant was not required to bat in India's second innings as centuries from Shubman Gill, Ravindra Jadeja, and Washington Sundar ensured a draw. However, his courage while injured has become one of the defining moments of the series.With England leading 2-1, the final Test at The Oval begins Thursday.",Gautam Gambhir confirms wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant has been ruled out of the fifth and final Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.

POST-MATCH

GILL EXPLAINS

NEW DELHI: Ravindra Jadeja Washington Sundar , and Shubman Gill struck brilliant centuries as India battled their way to a morale-boosting draw in the fourth Test on Sunday. Starting their second innings 311 runs behind, India defied the odds on a fifth-day pitch, thanks to Gill (103), KL Rahul (90), Jadeja (107*), and Washington (101*), who all stood tall with the bat.With the series now standing at 2-1 in England’s favour, the fifth and final Test will be played at The Oval in London from July 31.While India’s gritty batting display took centre stage, the match wasn’t short on drama—especially the series of ‘handshake’ incidents that stirred controversy on the final day.In the final hour of play, England skipper Ben Stokes offered a handshake, effectively suggesting the match be called a draw.Indian batters Ravindra Jadeja (on 89) and Washington Sundar (on 80) declined the offer.The refusal frustrated Stokes and several England players.Stokes approached the umpire with the suggestion, but Jadeja and Sundar, both nearing centuries, chose to continue batting.Moments later, stump mics caught a verbal exchange between Harry Brook , Zak Crawley, and Jadeja.Crawley and Ben Duckett were seen questioning India's intent to play on.Stokes sarcastically asked Jadeja, “Do you want to score a hundred against Harry Brook?”Jadeja calmly responded, “I can't do anything.”Despite the remarks, Jadeja stayed composed and continued batting with a smile.In what seemed like a mark of protest, Stokes handed the ball to Harry Brook.Jadeja responded by smashing Brook for a six to reach his third Test century.Washington Sundar soon followed, bringing up his maiden Test hundred.Their centuries capped off a remarkable comeback and helped India draw the Test.Despite the earlier tension, Stokes eventually shook hands with both Jadeja and Sundar after the match ended in a draw.Shubman Gill later revealed that the decision to bat on came from Jadeja and Sundar themselves.“They batted brilliantly and were in their 90s. We felt they deserved their hundreds,” said Gill.He added, “Every match going till the last session on the last day. So many learnings. Each Test teaches you something new.”","Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, and Shubman Gill hit centuries as India battled their way to a morale-boosting draw in the fourth Test on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: India skipper Shubman Gill has backed Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar's decision to delay the handshakes on Day 5 of the drawn fourth Test at Old Trafford, saying both batters deserved their centuries. The Test ended in a draw, but not before a brief flare-up between the Indian and English players over the decision to continue batting after England offered to end the match early.Speaking at the post-match presentation, Gill said the mood in the dressing room felt like a win: “The kind of position that we were in yesterday in the morning, it definitely feels like a win. Especially losing those two early wickets... the way we showed grit and determination, it was just very pleasing to watch.”India were 0/2 chasing down a 311-run deficit but finished strong at 425/4, thanks to unbeaten centuries from Jadeja (107*) and Sundar (101*), who added a 203-run partnership.As for the last-hour drama, Gill gave a blunt explanation: “I think both the batsmen batted brilliantly and were in their 90s. And a Test hundred is a Test hundred at the end of the day.Washington's first, and from the situation we were in, they deserved it.”His comments came after England captain Ben Stokes expressed frustration over India's refusal to shake hands despite being well past saving the Test. A visibly irritated Stokes even asked sarcastically, “Do you want to score a hundred against Harry Brook?” — after bringing on the part-time bowler in protest.Yet Jadeja maintained composure, calmly replying, “I can't do anything,” before launching Brook into the stands to bring up his hundred.Gill praised both Jadeja and Sundar's composure: “It's all about taking the wicket out of the equation. Day 5 wicket, every ball is an event. We just wanted to go ball by ball and take it deep. They did that perfectly.”The five-match series now heads into a decider at The Oval, with England leading 2-1.","India skipper Shubman Gill backs Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar's decision to delay the handshakes on Day 5 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford.

NEW DELHI: Ravindra Jadeja has etched his name into cricketing folklore by equalling an iconic record held by the legendary Sir Garfield Sobers. On Day 5 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, the Indian all-rounder brought up his fifth 50-plus score of the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy 2025, matching Sobers' 1966 record for the most 50+ scores at No.6 or lower in a Test series in England.Both Jadeja and Sobers achieved the feat in eight innings, underlining the consistency and impact of the Indian all-rounder in the lower-middle order. Jadeja’s performance has now firmly placed him alongside the West Indian great in multiple elite lists.Jadeja also became the joint-most prolific visiting batter in England with nine fifty-plus scores at No.6 or lower — a record he now shares with Sobers. Furthermore, he is one of only two visiting cricketers to score over 1000 runs at that position in England, the other being Sobers again.Adding to his all-round dominance, Jadeja has now taken 34 wickets in England, making him only the third visiting player to score 1000+ runs and take 30+ wickets in a country, after Sobers and England great Wilfred Rhodes (in Australia).In the fourth Test, Jadeja’s unbeaten 107 was part of a heroic rearguard that saw India claw back from 0/2 to finish at 425/4, securing a hard-fought draw against England's massive 669-run first innings.Jadeja’s five fifty-plus scores in the current series is the most by any Indian batting at No.6 or lower in a single Test series, equalling VVS Laxman ’s record from 2002 in the West Indies.With 12 fifty-plus scores in SENA countries while batting lower down the order, Jadeja is now second only to MS Dhoni (13), and he’s done it in just 47 innings — an astonishing strike rate for someone long considered a bowling all-rounder.Jadeja’s current series scores — 89, 69*, 72, 61*, 20, and 107* — highlight not just consistency, but the ability to shape match outcomes under pressure. He remains central to India’s hopes ahead of the final Test at The Oval, with England leading the series 2-1.","Ravindra Jadeja equalled Sir Garfield Sobers' record for most 50-plus scores at No.6 or lower in a Test series in England.

Ben Stokes press conference: On handshake controversy, India fightback, his own fitness

Poll Do you agree with Ravindra Jadeja's decision to continue batting despite the draw offer? Yes, it was a brave decision No, they should have accepted the draw

India battled their way to a hard-fought draw on Day 5 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, but it was Ravindra Jadeja ’s refusal to settle for a draw despite a mutual offer from England that triggered a stir.As the final hour approached, with the match meandering towards a draw, England captain Ben Stokes offered a handshake to close out the contest. But Jadeja, fresh off leading a resilient fightback alongside Washington Sundar, declined the offer and pressed on. His determined century, under immense pressure after an early collapse (India were 0/2 in their second innings), became the turning point in India’s bid to save the Test.While Stokes later said his gesture was driven by practicality, India skipper Shubman Gill and head coach Gautam Gambhir stood firmly behind Jadeja’s call to continue batting. Adding weight to that view, former England captain Alastair Cook backed Jadeja's decision as the right one.“It was the right decision for them to carry on, for the momentum they’re getting from it,” Cook said on BBC Sport. “When you’re out in the field for 140 overs, you get frustrated.It’s a little bit of frustration for England, but I understand why India do it.”Cook added, “Five years down the line, you look at the scorecard, you see two brilliant hundreds to save the game—plus obviously Gill’s as well—so it will be forgotten about Harry Brook's 37-mile-an-hour ball.”With the five-match series poised at 2-1 in England’s favour, the final Test now becomes a must-win for India. Given how they clawed their way back into this one, India will head into the decider with renewed confidence and momentum.","India battled their way to a hard-fought draw on Day 5 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford.

Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar has lambasted England captain for his conduct after he called for a draw before the final hour in Manchester.""Ben Stokes behaved like a spoiled kid,"" Sanjay Manjrekar said on JioHotstar.Former England cricketer Jonathan Trott, however, defended Ben Stokes.""Common practice in England, and Ben Stokes' mentality is that there are no personal milestones.

Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba of Inter Miami have been suspended by Major League Soccer for missing Wednesday's All-Star game, making them ineligible for Saturday's match against FC Cincinnati. The league announced the suspension on Friday, enforcing its policy that requires selected players to participate in the All-Star game unless they have valid reasons for absence.The duo withdrew from the showcase event early Wednesday without revealing their reasons.

I don't think there's a player -- or anyone -- who has done more for Major League Soccer than Messi.I fully understand, respect, and admire his commitment to Inter Miami, and I respect his decision.

The All India Football Federation may not have found its next head coach yet, but the hiring process has already delivered an unexpected twist in Xavi Hernandez. The iconic Spanish midfielder and former Barcelona manager, was among the 170 applicants for the job.The application, sent from Xavi’s personal email and highlighted in green in the official shortlist, took officials by surprise. “Yes, Xavi’s name was there. The application was emailed to the AIFF,” national team director Subrata Paul told TOI earlier. However, the technical committee did not pursue his candidacy further due to the significant financial implications.Beyond Xavi, the federation received interest from a mix of coaches with some well-known in Indian circles and others with global pedigree. The list included former India coach Stephen Constantine, Slovakia’s Stefan Tarkovic, Liverpool legend Harry Kewell, ex-Blackburn boss Steve Kean, and familiar ISL faces such as Kibu Vicuna, Eelco Schattorie, and Khalid Jamil. Of those, Constantine, Tarkovic, and Jamil have been shortlisted, with Jamil being the lone Indian contender.Xavi’s CV speaks for itself. A product of Barcelona’s famed La Masia academy, he made over 700 appearances for the club, winning eight La Liga titles, four Champions League crowns, and playing a key role in Spain’s World Cup win in 2010 and Euro triumphs in 2008 and 2012.As a coach, he won league titles with both Al Sadd in Qatar and Barcelona, including the 2022–23 La Liga and 2023 Spanish Super Cup before stepping down in 2024.While the AIFF couldn’t afford him, Xavi’s application is seen as a sign of the growing international appeal of Indian football.

NEW DELHI: All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Kalyan Chaubey on Thursday assured franchises, players, coaches and other stakeholders that the Indian Super League (ISL) would take place this season, potentially with a slight delay due to ongoing litigation in the Supreme Court.Chaubey also said that a new head coach for the Indian men’s football team would be named within the next 10 days after the technical committee submits the names of three shortlisted candidates – GreekCypriot Stephen Constantine, Slovakia’s Stefan Tarkovic and home-grown Khalid Jamil – to the AIFF’s executive committee (EC) on Wednesday.“If the league doesn’t take place, not only footballers but the people who are associated with football will be affected. Thousands of people will be affected. So, we will put our best effort to ensure that the league happens,” Chaubey said.Earlier this month, Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), the body that owns and organises ISL, had written to the AIFF and the clubs stating that the league had been kept on hold.In May, the apex court instructed the AIFF and FSDL not to enter into any negotiations until the final verdict on the AIFF constitution comes.ISL typically runs from Sept to April.“As and when the court’s decision comes, the AIFF will take a call, sit with all the stakeholders and ensure how smoothly these tournaments, including ISL, can be conducted,” Chaubey concluded.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Kalyan Chaubey on Thursday assured franchises, players, coaches and other stakeholders that the Indian Super League (ISL) would take place this season.

TOI

The technical committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) rubbed their eyes in disbelief when they saw the long list of candidates for the India coaching job.There were the familiar names like former national team coach Stephen Constatine, Liverpool star Harry Kewell, former Blackburn Rovers manager Steve Kean, India’s own Khalid Jamil, and coaches like Kibu Vicuna and Eelco Schattorie, whose work is known in the country. But at the bottom of a list prepared by AIFF’s national team director Subrata Paul, there was Xavi Hernandez.Marked in green, the former Barcelona coach and legend, someone who made more than 700 appearances for the Spanish giants, was shown to have sent the application from his own email ID. Unlike other shortlisted applications, the contact number column was blank.“It’s correct that Xavi’s name was there,” Paul toldon Thursday. “The application was emailed to the AIFF.”According to sources, the technical committee did not consider Xavi for the final shortlist due to the high financial cost. As player, the Spanish midfielder enjoyed a historic career, winning the FIFA World Cup in 2010 and two European championships. With Barcelona, he became the symbol of the club’s possession-based style of football and won 25 trophies, which includes eight La Liga titles and four Champions Leagues.Xavi kickstarted his coaching career with Al Sadd in Qatar, then returned to Barcelona as coach, but left after guiding the club to two trophies in two and a half seasons in charge, including the 2022-23 La Liga title.“Even if Xavi was genuinely interested in Indian football and could be convinced to take up the job, we would need a lot of money,” said a member of the technical committee who attended the virtual meeting on Wednesday.In a previous interview with The Athletic, Xavi said he “sometimes (follows) the Indian League because many Spanish coaches are there.”The technical committee has recommended three names to the AIFF executive committee to replace Manolo Marquez, who quit early this month. Jamil is the lone home-grown coach in the list, which also has Constantine, hoping for a third stint with the national team, and former Kyrgyzstan and Slovakia head coach Stefan Tarkovic.The shortlist was finalised by the technical committee chaired by former India captain IM Vijayan. Paul, and technical director Syed Sabir Pasha, were also in attendance, while inputs were sought from Dronacharya awardees Armando Colaco and Bimal Ghosh, who are advisors to AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey.",Xavi Hernandez is on the shortlist of candidates for the India coaching job.

Nick Cassidy takes third spot in Driver Standings

N ick Cassidy seems to have all the luck on his side as he went on to win his third race of the season, just days after announcing his exit from Jaguar TCS Racing at the end of this season. The New Zealander won the London E-Prix Round 15 race at the ExCeL Arena on Saturday. He himself called the win “unbelievable,” which was also witnessed by his grandmother at the circuit. Not only that, he also secured a front-row start for the Round 16 race on Sunday.Nick Cassidy himself was in disbelief over his third win and said, “It’s unbelievable! To win here at home for Jaguar and our team, in front of a lot of our friends, family, and partners who are here today, is incredible.”Talking about their strategy and the car, he said, “I wasn’t the happiest guy this morning, but that was for a reason, and I knew we had good potential in the car. In that race, I was able to show that, which is pretty cool.To be honest, it was a little bit fluid — a huge shoutout to my strategy team. I was really scared about not coming out of the pits after Pit Boost in the lead of that second group, and it was tight, but I was able to hang on there, and that’s what made the race.It meant that we could do the Attack Modes later, which was really powerful.”Nick Cassidy also shared a video montage of his podium celebration, where he sprayed champagne and celebrated with his team and family. He wrote, “Parked it in Victory Lane in London! That was incredibly special and will take a while to sink in. One more race today to finish off the season @jaguarracing.”The official social media pages of Formula E also shared a video featuring Cassidy’s grandmother, who witnessed his victory at the London E-Prix.

Kush Maini is a pro when it comes to cricket knowledge

Who is Kush Maini?

Mahindra Racing’s Indian Formula 2 champion Kush Maini is not just an impressive presence on the track but also well-versed in his country’s favourite sport — cricket. The racer from Bengaluru recently took a cricket quiz and nearly scored a perfect 10/10, answering almost every question with precision. He is the only Indian to have won a Formula 2 race in Monaco and recently delivered an impressive performance at the Berlin Rookie Test, finishing among the top three in both sessions.A video of Kush Maini’s cricket quiz shows him getting momentarily confused with the first question, though he gave the correct answer initially. When asked about the number of players in a cricket team, he initially said “eleven” but changed it to “twelve” after counting the number of openers and following players.After that brief hiccup, Maini breezed through the quiz like a pro. He correctly answered questions about the criteria for a four and a six, and explained terms like LBW, duck, and clean bowled. He also knew the number of overs bowled in T20, One-Day, and Test matches.When asked which team Virat Kohli represents in the IPL, Maini confidently replied, “RCB… that’s me, can’t get that wrong.” He also tackled a question about the British singer who joked about not understanding cricket despite coming from the country that invented it.Maini answered “Ed Sheeran” — and was pleasantly surprised to learn he was right. He also knew that David Beckham was the English footballer who once played a friendly match with Sachin Tendulkar.Watch Kush Maini’s candid video here Kush Maini moved to England at the age of 13–14 to pursue racing. Originally from Bengaluru, he now spends more time abroad than in India. He became the first Indian to win the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix in Formula 2 earlier this year.He recently showcased his racing talent during the Berlin Rookie Test, representing Mahindra Racing. He finished second in the morning session and third in the afternoon. Speaking after the test, he said, “In the morning, we focused on 350kW runs, and in the afternoon, more on race runs. Whatever the run, we were always in the top three and really fast, so a good step was made.

FIA and Formula E comment on agreement extension



In good news for Formula E, a multi-year agreement extension has secured the rights to the FIA Formula E World Championship for an additional 10 years from 2038, when the current agreement ends. This ensures a long and thrilling future for the FIA Formula E World Championship. The long-term extension will enable Formula E to grow further, build strategic long-range partnerships, and drive greater fan engagement.At present, Formula E continues to focus on its phased development strategy for its racing cars — delivering faster top speeds, greater acceleration, enhanced aerodynamics, and improved tyre performance. These developments highlight the series' increased relevance to consumers and the wider EV market, with greater “race to road” technology transfer.With electric vehicle sales projected to rise to over 40% of global vehicle sales by 2030, and global lithium-ion battery production expected to triple by 2030, the relevance of Formula E and its technological advancements is more critical than ever. The Formula E GEN3 Evo already represents a step-change in performance: 0–60 mph in just 1.82 seconds (30% faster than a current Formula 1 car), a 200 mph top speed, and nearly 50% of the energy needed to complete a race regenerated during the event.It is designed with sustainability at its core and includes tyres made with 35% recycled materials and bodywork incorporating recycled carbon fibre and natural fibres.Formula E sees the participation of major automotive manufacturers including Porsche, Jaguar, Nissan, Maserati, Stellantis, Mahindra, and Lola-Yamaha. Since its first race in Beijing in 2014, Formula E has grown by 20% year-on-year, reaching around 400 million fans globally and attracting a television audience of approximately half a billion.The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the global governing body for motorsport and mobility organisations, has announced a multi-year extension to its agreement with Formula E Holdings Limited (majority-owned by Liberty Global).Mohammed Ben Sulayem, President at the FIA, said, “The extension of the agreement governing the FIA Formula E World Championship is a fantastic outcome for the sport and a clear reflection of our ongoing strategy at the FIA to foster long-term stability, innovation, and growth across all areas of motorsport.”He further said, “This milestone reaffirms our commitment to innovation, sustainability, and technological progress, which are all central to the Championship’s unique identity and purpose. It also aligns with our broader goal of increasing global participation and driving more accessible motorsport for all. We are delighted to be continuing this journey with Formula E, and I look forward to seeing it grow even further, both on and off the track, in the years to come. ”FIA Chief Commercial Officer Craig Edmondson, said, “Formula E has not only demonstrated impressive growth since its inception, but has also led the way on sustainable innovation in our industry. This is a landmark agreement for the FIA and Formula E, and we are excited to be working with the Championship in the years to come.”Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries said, “We’ve believed in Formula E since day one, and this extension reaffirms our confidence in where it’s headed. This is the motorsport of the future - a championship that combines the very latest technology, close-combat racing, and a mission that really matters.“With the FIA’s continued backing, we can now take the next big steps - scaling the sport, growing its global fanbase, and continuing to push the boundaries of what electric racing can achieve. With this new agreement in place, Formula E is now positioned better than ever to define the future of motorsport - more innovative, more inclusive, more sustainable - and to inspire the next generation of fans, drivers, and partners around the world. ""Also Read: Formula E London E-Prix 2025: Pascal Wehrlein tops FP1, Jake Dennis finishes second Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds also added, “Formula E’s growth since its inception has been nothing short of extraordinary, with hundreds of millions of fans and world-class teams and drivers deciding to choose highly competitive electric racing. This long-term extension of the partnership enables us to continue building the brand, investing in the product and delivering some of the most captivating racing that has made us famous. With this long-term extension, the opportunity that Formula E now has to impact world motorsport will be truly transformational.”","The FIA Formula E World Championship has been extended by 10 years.

Obviously, in the race, it was changeable conditions. I think the team really managed the strategy well. I had some problems after the pit stop, which allowed Pascal (Wehrlein) to get closer to me.”""So once it happened, I thought I might have to stop in the race, and I was just kind of like, well, that just sums up my season. Luckily, I was able to juggle both things and bring them home, but it just wasn't expected. I'm just very happy for my side of the garage, for the team — you know, it's been a good day for what's been a really difficult season,"" he added.Also Read: Berlin E-Prix 2025 Results: Mitch Evans clinches second win of season, Pascal Wehrlein closes points gap with Oliver Rowland After regaining his confidence, Mitch Evans will now be competing in London, where he is tied for the most number of podiums — five in total.

Other Formula E initiatives

Formula E has several initiatives running under its sustainability campaign. Among them is a youth education program called Driving Force, supported by PIF E360. It aims to teach children between the ages of 8 and 18 about science, technology, and sustainability. The goal is to reach over 50,000 students worldwide by the end of 2025.The Driving Force initiative comes at a time when there is expected to be a massive demand for 200,000 skilled workers in the UK for green jobs by 2030, according to PwC.Driving Force helps students learn about clean energy and the environment. It also introduces them to role models from the fields of science and technology, helping them gain the knowledge and confidence needed to consider careers in these areas. These workshops use fun and practical activities to show how what students learn in school can lead to exciting real-world careers in racing, clean energy, engineering, and more.On July 16, over 90 students participated in Formula E’s Driving Force workshop at Hammersmith Academy in London. The session was one of five workshops held at schools across London in July, near the London E-Prix race site in East London and Formula E’s headquarters in Hammersmith.Earlier this year, similar workshops were also held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and Miami, USA, during Formula E race weeks.Julia Pallé, VP of Sustainability at Formula E, said, ""A survey in 2024 of more than 7,000 UK secondary school students reveals a worrying downward trend in both their involvement in and their ambition to pursue STEM subjects — a stark wake-up call for educators and policymakers alike.""""Teachers are being asked to make stronger connections between subjects and careers, but they need support from employers to do that effectively.

The Greek tennis star, now ranked 29th globally, is returning to work with his father Apostolos following poor results and public criticism from the Croatian about his fitness levels.Tsitsipas confirmed the split through a statement, saying, ""Working with Goran Ivanišević was a brief but intense experience and a truly valuable chapter in my journey.""Ivanišević, who previously coached Novak Djokovic, toldthat the split was amicable. He supported Tsitsipas's decision to return to his father, noting, ""He had his best results with his father, his father knows him the best so I agree that is the right decision.""Their partnership started during the French Open but quickly soured. Under Ivanišević, Tsitsipas won only one match at the Halle Open before losing to Luciano Darderi. He then retired with a back injury in the first round of Wimbledon against Valentin Royer.The relationship became strained when Ivanišević publicly criticised Tsitsipas's fitness. ""I was shocked. I have never seen a more unprepared player in my life. With this knee, I am three times more fit than him. This is really bad,"" the Croatian coach toldTsitsipas later hinted at his dissatisfaction, telling, ""It is very difficult to have dictators and people who speak negatively and you don't feel like they are close to you like family.""The 26-year-old has struggled to maintain his form over the past year. He removed his father from his coaching team last August after losing to Kei Nishikori, then ranked 576th. He's also made equipment changes and tried new tactics but continues to struggle against the evolving playing styles of younger stars like Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz.Tsitsipas's ranking has dropped out of the top 20 for the first time since 2018.","Stefanos Tsitsipas has ended his brief coaching partnership with Goran Ivanisevic.

Poll What do you think is the biggest factor in Alcaraz's decision to withdraw? Wimbledon fatigue and recovery Injury concerns

World No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz has pulled out of next week’s ATP Canadian Open in Toronto, citing the need to recover after his run to the Wimbledon final earlier this month. Tournament organisers confirmed the Spaniard’s withdrawal on Monday.Alcaraz, a five-time Grand Slam singles champion, lost to world No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the Wimbledon final on July 13. The 22-year-old had been aiming for a third consecutive Wimbledon title.""I'm really sad to have to miss the National Bank Open in Toronto,"" Alcaraz said in a statement. ""I tried my best to be ready for the tournament as it's one I really enjoy playing, but it comes just too soon for me as I recover after Wimbledon. I wish the event well and look forward to being back on the Canadian courts next year.""Alcaraz reached the quarter-finals in his best run at the Canadian Open in 2023, where he was beaten by American Tommy Paul.Tournament director Karl Hale said losing a player like Alcaraz was disappointing.""It's disappointing to lose a player of Carlos' quality, as we know our fans were looking forward to watching him,"" Hale said. ""Although he has been on the scene for a while, he's still at the beginning of his career and there will be plenty of opportunities for Canadians to see him again in the future.""American Sebastian Korda (world No. 33) and Poland’s Hubert Hurkacz (world No. 38) have also withdrawn due to leg and knee injuries, respectively.",World No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz pulls out of ATP Canadian Open in Toronto.

This comes right after other big names dropped out of the ATP Masters hardcourt tournament.“After many consecutive weeks of competition without rest, I will not be able to play in Toronto this year,” Alcaraz wrote on X. “I have small muscle issues and I need to recover physically and mentally for what comes next. To the tournament and to my fans in Canada I am very sorry, I will see you next year!”Sinner, who beat Alcaraz at Wimbledon, won't defend his Toronto title due to an elbow injury from a fall at the All England Club. ""Winning that title in Toronto two years ago was the start of a really special moment for me, but after speaking with my team, I have to recover,"" Sinner explained.The tournament took another hit when Djokovic, a four-time champion, backed out citing a groin injury. Britain's Draper also withdrew to heal his injured forearm.The women's tournament in Montreal hasn't been spared either, with world No. 1 Sabalenka joining the list of absentees.Both tournaments will kick off with qualifying rounds this weekend, though they'll now be missing many fan favourites.

If

How do you, when beaten to the ground, bruised and busted, get back on your feet? Jannik Sinner knows.The 23-year-old wore his pain plainly in Paris, seated at his court side space, having finished at the wrong end of the five-hour 29-minute epic against Carlos Alcaraz.Five weeks later, on a dazzling Sunday in July, he punctuated a five-match losing streak against his arch nemesis, and brought a rivalry to life on Wimbledon ’s lawns. No tennis player has crossed the channel with greater purpose than Sinner, turning the Paris heartbreak to a memorable hurrah, his fourth Major title, and first in this leafy London suburb.The mental miles the 23-year-old Italian covered in the five weeks must anoint him as the sport’s newest mentalist.On the wall of the players’ entrance to Centre Court are the words from, a Rudyard Kipling poem: “If you can meet with triumph and disaster/ And treat those two impostors just the same.”In terms of expression, Sinner doesn’t give much away, no passionate celebration like Alcaraz on Paris’ red clay, just a smile that sparked his eyes. The turnaround was scripted during a stretch that features a diabolic switch of surfaces, from stubborn red clay to slick grass.It was when the Italian picked himself up, and in washing away the stains of squandering three successive match points, he underlined the size of his fight.There were big questions surrounding Sinner’s morale coming into Wimbledon. “This is the part I’m the proudest of because it has not been easy,” said Sinner, who tried to take positives from his loss in Paris. “It’s much better that you lose a Grand Slam final that way than someone kills you, you make two games.”The Italian’s coaches — Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi — discussed Roland Garros threadbare with Sinner for about 24 hours after the final but didn’t bring it up again thereafter.“For us it was important to move forward as quickly as possible,” Cahill said. “The week leading to Wimbledon was the best practice week we’ve ever had as far as attitude and form. We knew we had something special coming in. We knew that he had already put Roland Garros behind him. He was playing with real purpose. You could see that from the first match that he played, he wasn’t carrying any baggage from Roland Garros.”Following his win on Sunday, the world No. 1 leaves London with a hefty 3,430-point lead over Alcaraz.Sinner’s struggles of the last six months — when he served a three-month doping ban (February to May) for testing positive for anabolic agent clostebol — included the reactions of the locker room, most of who weren’t supportive of the Italian. A large section of the players thought the four-time Major winner had been treated favourably, add to that the vitriol directed at him on social media, and he was wading through murky waters.The 23-year-old, a methodical creature, turned to work, shrugging the weight off his shoulders. “We’ve tried to push at every practice session, I was struggling at times mentally,” Sinner explained. “Maybe even more in practice sessions because I feel when I play the match, I can switch off and just play.”Sinner’s win on Sunday was significant as much for himself as for this young rivalry. While the Italian is obviously too good a player to never beat the Spaniard again, the five successive losses across a near two-year stretch was beginning to gnaw. Sinner said, “When you lose several times against someone, it’s not easy.”Cahill pinned Sinner’s victory to the details. “You saw a bit more energy from him in the big moments, a bit more focus to knuckle down and make sure that when he had his nose in front, he kept on closing the door against Carlos,” the Aussie said.Vagnozzi added, “He was brave today, in the important moments he was really brave.”Alcaraz, the charismatic Spaniard, now leads the rivalry 8-5, but these numbers become irrelevant on the court where the margins are infinitesimal. Also, Sinner and Alcaraz are a level above the rest of the field.“Our level is really high, we don’t watch a level like this when other players are playing against each other,” Alcaraz said. “This rivalry is becoming better and better. We’re building a really great rivalry, we’re playing in the finals of Grand Slams, Masters, the best tournaments in the world. It’s going to get better and better.”That’s the bargain the Italian spent a little over three hours on Sunday signing on.",Jannik Sinner beat Carlos Alcaraz to win Wimbledon men's singles title.

Poll Will Sinner's Wimbledon victory change the future of Italian tennis? Yes, it will inspire future generations No, it won't have a significant impact

Jannik Sinner whipped a forehand cross-court that had Carlos Alcaraz scrambling to his right. The energetic Spaniard was on it in a flash. Two shots later, it was Alcaraz's turn to have Sinner on the run - moving to his right on a short, angled ball. The Italian responded with a cracking forehand down the line that looked destined to be a winner. In most cases, against most opponents, that would have been a winner or at least forced an error. Instead, Alcaraz took a couple of steps to his left, flung his backhand with some spin, and it landed in - much to everyone's surprise. The crowd on Centre Court was up on its feet.Still, 44 minutes into the Wimbledon final, Jannik Sinner could be forgiven for thinking about yet another title clash he had let slip. Just four weeks ago, Sinner was two sets up against Alcaraz in the French Open final. The Italian had three championship points, and failed to capitalise. Alcaraz went on to turn the match around to clinch his fifth major title.The script was turning out to be quite similar so far. Sinner led 4-2 in the first set and hadn’t put a foot wrong. Yet, Alcaraz elevated his level to bag four games in a row, including that seemingly unwinnable point, to take the opener.The turning point came a game later. It wasn’t a stellar shot, or a crucial juncture in the contest, or one of the many dramatic points played between these two new rivals in men’s tennis. It was a routine forehand that Alcaraz sent long at 30-40 in the second set. It gave Sinner the service break and the momentum, which he never let go of.Forty-eight minutes after seeing that ball land in, dropping the first set and possibly getting those flashes of Paris, it was Sinner’s turn to hit a remarkable shot to clinch the second set. The 22-year-old Spaniard’s angled backhand pushed Sinner to his left. The 23-year-old went down the line before Alcaraz forced him into covering the vacant court. On the run – seemingly with sliding shoes on – Sinner threw the kitchen sink at it, firing a forehand cross-court winner. “Unbelievable,” chimed the commentator. The crowd, on its feet, felt similarly, with the decibel level rising.The dramatics of that Paris evening on June 8 were not repeated – even if there were hints of it. In the fourth set, having taken the third, Sinner broke early like he had in Paris. But he never gave it back – unlike Paris. There was a whiff of danger as two break-point chances came and went for Alcaraz at 4-3.There were no signs of nerves, either, as Sinner closed out the match to win his first Wimbledon title with a 137mph serve his fastest of the day.“He needed that win today,” Sinner’s coach Darren Cahill said. “So he knew the importance of closing this one out when he had the opportunities. I think you saw a bit more energy from him in the big moments and a bit more focus to knuckle down and make sure that when he had his nose in front, that he kept on closing the door against Carlos.”The emotions at the end showed how much it meant to him. He raised both arms before going down on his haunches in the middle of the court and tapping the grass, as the applause grew bigger and louder. The top-ranked player then made his way to his coaches, his family, and friends including his brother, who didn’t miss it this time for a Formula 1 race!Sinner’s ability to out-hit opponents cannot be doubted. As he became the first Italian to win a singles title at Wimbledon, his mental fortitude stood out as well.“It’s the part I’m most proud of because it hasn’t been easy. I always try to be honest with myself. Things can happen. If you lose a Grand Slam final that way, it’s much better than losing where someone kills you by losing two games,” he said of bouncing back from the disappointment of losing the French Open final. “That’s why I said after Roland Garros that it’s not the time to put me down because another Grand Slam is coming up – and I did great here,” he added.Sinner had the champagne cork between his fingers during the second set as an overzealous fan popped some bubbly at SW19. At the time, all the Italian did was usher it to the ball girl, who got rid of it. “Only here at Wimbledon – but that’s exactly why we love playing here,” he said after the match when asked if he’d ever had that happen before. “It’s a very expensive tournament, you know,” he added to laughs.At the time, getting his hands on some champagne was premature. Now, with the job done, and deservedly so, he got his hands on the champagne, the trophy, and £3,000,000 in prize money.",Jannik Sinner beat Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets to win Wimbledon men's singles title.

Indian-American Ronit Karki may not have cleared the final hurdle in the Wimbledon junior boys event on Sunday, but the 17-year-old has done enough these last two weeks working his way through the qualifying draw and making the title round -to show that he’s a talent to watch out for.Karki went down 2-6, 3-6 to world No.6 Ivan Ivanov, the 16year-old from of Bulgaria, in the boy’s final. Earlier in his run to the final, Karki, ranked 52, took down No.9 Yannik Alexandrescou of Romania, No. 8 Jack Kennedy of the United States, No.14 Alan Wazny of Poland, and No. 12 Alexander Vasilev of Bulgaria. Karki played the J300 at Roehampton two weeks ago, making the third round, when competing for the first time on grass.The New Jersey-born teen, who trains in Florida, was just one out of the main draw, but said he wouldn’t change a thing about playing the qualifiers. “Everything is connected, so maybe playing the qualifying draw was a good thing, and maybe the reason why I’m here right now,” he said.Karki, whose family home is in East Brunswick, New Jersey, took to tennis because his father Trilok started playing the sport when he lived in New York with his wife Kanchan. “My sister (Naomi) started playing tennis too, then I just picked it up because my sister and my dad played it,” Karki said, “My dad is the reason I play tennis.”","Ronit Karki, 17, lost 2-6, 3-6 to world No.6 Ivan Ivanov in the Wimbledon junior boys final.

After dropping the first set, the Italian bounced back gracefully to win the title in style: 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.

This is my first tennis tournament, and that too, Wimbledon. The passion everyone here has for tennis is great to see,” said the athlete, speaking to Star Sports.“Roger Federer has been a very tough competitor during his days. The way he has carried Switzerland’s flag in the field of tennis, especially at Wimbledon—I have met him, and the way he has maintained himself, his brand value, and his family, it speaks a lot about that person,” Neeraj added, highlighting his admiration for the most successful player at Wimbledon.Besides Neeraj, another popular personality from the world of sport made her way to Wimbledon. Preity Zinta, co-owner of Punjab Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL), also appeared at the event.

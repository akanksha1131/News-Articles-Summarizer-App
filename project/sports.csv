Poll What did you think of Mohammed Shami's performance on his return to First-Class cricket? Outstanding Improving Disappointing Too early to judge

East Zone restricted North Zone to 308 for six on day one of the Duleep Trophy quarterfinals in Bengaluru on Thursday, with Mohammed Shami making his first First-Class appearance since November 2024 and young spinner Manishi delivering key strikes. Middle-order batter Ayush Badoni scored a quick 63 off 60 balls on a favorable pitch.Shami, who missed the recent Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy in England due to concerns about his ability to handle long spells, showed steady improvement throughout the day. His initial spells lacked sharpness as he adjusted to long-format cricket.The veteran pacer's first morning spell read 5-2-10-0, followed by a second spell of 3-0-10-0. North Zone openers Ankit Kumar and Shubham Khajuria handled these spells comfortably.Shami found better rhythm in his post-lunch spell of 4-2-9-0, testing batters outside the off-stump with occasional in-dippers that troubled Badoni and Nishant Sindhu.A missed opportunity came during Shami's fourth spell when Kumar Kushagra dropped Kanhaiya Wadhawan at long-on. However, Shami soon claimed his first wicket when Sahil Lotra edged behind.The 34-year-old pacer completed 17 overs with figures of 1/55, demonstrating his ability to manage multiple spells without significant discomfort.Ayush Badoni impressed with his aggressive batting style, particularly his drives. Fresh from a successful Delhi Premier League campaign, he adapted well to red-ball cricket before falling to pacer Mukhtar Hussain while attempting a pull shot.Several North Zone batters made promising starts but failed to convert them into substantial scores. Khajuria scored 26, Ankit made 30, Yash Dhull contributed 39, and Nishant added 47.The day saw a brief concern when India pacer Mukesh Kumar left the field for nine overs between sessions to address a hamstring issue. He returned during the middle session.North Zone scored briskly in the first phase, reaching 139 in 34 overs despite losing three wickets. All three dismissals came from 21-year-old Jamshedpur spinner Manishi, who capitalized on the batters' mistakes.The match's opening day highlighted East Zone's bowling effort, particularly from young spinner Manishi, while also marking Shami's return to long-format cricket ahead of the upcoming home Test series against West Indies.North Zone batters maintained a good scoring rate throughout the day after East Zone chose to bowl first, though they couldn't convert their starts into bigger scores.The pitch played true, offering little assistance to the bowlers, but East Zone's disciplined bowling, particularly from Manishi and Shami's improving spells, kept North Zone in check.",East Zone restricted North Zone to 308 for six on day one of the Duleep Trophy quarterfinals in Bengaluru.

Former India bowling coach Bharat Arun has made a startling revelation about Mohammed Shami, who in 2018 wanted to quit cricket after he failed the fitness test and was going through a rough phase in his personal life.""When Shami was going through trauma and a crisis in his personal life, Ravi (Shastri) spoke to him and told him, ‘Any support you need, please feel free to ask,’"" said former India bowling coach Bharat Arun in conversation with K. Shriniwas Rao, Head of Content (Sports), Times Internet, in the latest episode of Bombay Sport Exchange.""And in 2018, just before the tour of England, we had a match against Afghanistan (Test match in Bengaluru). Shami failed the fitness test and he was dropped from the team.""He was very dejected. He was at the peak of his personal problems as well. So he came to my room and said, '' (I will quit cricket).""So I asked him, 'What are you going to do after quitting cricket? Whatever you are and whatever you have achieved is because of cricket.' He said he was angry. I took him to Ravi.""Ravi said, 'If you are angry and you have the ball in your hand, show your anger with the ball. You want to quit cricket because your body is not fit?'""We sent him to the NCA and the only instruction was to work on him physically, no bowling. Three weeks after we sent him to the NCA, he called me and said: '' (I am running like a horse).""That is how Mohammed Shami regained his confidence and he played those five Test matches in England. In the fifth Test match, after tea time on the last day, he bowled a spell at 140 kmph — that was his fitness level.

Poll What do you think is Rohit Sharma's greatest strength as a player? Calmness under pressure Ability to score big runs Leadership skills Consistency across formats

Indian ODI captain Rohit Sharma celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi with his parents and brother, soaking in the warmth of tradition with his loved ones. The festival has always been close to the heart of the Mumbai cricketer, who grew up witnessing the city’s vibrant devotion to Lord Ganesha. This year, though, the celebrations carry deeper meaning, coming just a few months after Rohit stepped away from Test cricket in May 2025.Rohit’s Test journey was a fascinating one. He played 67 matches, scoring 4,301 runs at an average of 40.57, including 12 centuries. Though his red-ball career had its ups and downs, it was marked by memorable knocks at the top of the order and leadership moments that shaped Indian cricket.He had already drawn curtains on his T20I career in 2024, signing off on the highest of notes by leading India to the T20 World Cup crown. Over the course of 159 T20Is, Rohit scored 4,231 runs at an average of 32.05, with five centuries — the most by any batter in the format along with Glenn Maxwell.The ODI format is now Rohit’s sole focus. Having played 273 matches so far, he has amassed 11,168 runs at an impressive average of 48.76, with 32 centuries to his name.His calm presence at the top and ability to rise on the biggest occasions have made him one of India’s greatest white-ball batters.Away from the numbers, Ganesh Chaturthi offers Rohit a chance to reconnect with his family and faith. Fans caught a glimpse of him celebrating quietly at home, surrounded by his parents and brother, far from the spotlight of packed stadiums. It is this balance between his professional achievements and his simple family traditions that makes Rohit a figure of admiration.","Indian ODI captain Rohit Sharma celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi with his parents and brother, soaking in the warmth of tradition.

PANAJI: FIFA, the governing body for world football, and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), has reiterated that the “current elected executive committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is entitled to complete its full term from 2022 to 2026. ”The letter signed by Elkhan Mammadov, FIFA’s chief member associations officer and Vahid Kardany, deputy general secretary, member associations, AFC, was emailed to AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey on April 29 earlier this year.This letter, along with a recent FIFA-AFC communication dated August 26 which threatened to suspend India if there’s no definitive order from the Supreme Court and ratification of the Constitution by the general body before Oct 30, was submitted before the SC by AIFF’s lawyer Siddhesh S Kotwal on Thursday.In its letter, FIFA has drawn AIFF’s attention to a communication from Justice L. Nageswara Rao dated July 25, 2023, regarding the draft of the new AIFF Constitution. Justice Nageswara Rao was appointed by the Supreme Court and given the mandate to draft the AIFF Constitution in consultation with various stakeholders prior to its submission to the court.“According to the above-mentioned letter and following several meetings, notably the meeting held on July 12 (2023) at the FIFA headquarters in Zurich which was attended by representatives of FIFA, the AFC, the AIFF together with Justice L.Nageswara Rao, it was clearly stated and agreed, as mentioned in point “e”, that the AIFF executive committee elected in 2022 would serve its full term through to 2026 and that upon the completion of the mandate, elections of a new executive committee shall take place as prescribed in the amended Constitution. This was agreed following the decision of Justice L. Nageswara Rao to remove the specific transitional provision which was originally proposed in the draft confirming this matter,” the letter states.FIFA also said the draft constitution ratified by Justice L. Nageswara Rao’s office and submitted to the Supreme Court on July 31, 2023, states that the current AIFF elected executive committee is entitled to complete its full term.Point “e” referred to by FIFA in its communication to Chaubey is the ""transitional provisions pertaining to the application of the provisions of the amended Constitution” in Justice Nageswara Rao’s email to Nodar Akhalkatsi, FIFA’s director of strategic projects and member association governance, on July 25, 2023.“Upon deliberations and post our discussion and basis FIFA/AFC’s proposal for the same, it has been decided that the existing AIFF executive committee who were elected to their posts shall stay in power for the duration of their term. However, upon completion of the same, elections shall take place as prescribed in the amended Constitution and a new executive committee shall be elected.“Therein, it has been finalised that there shall be no provision pertaining to the same that is necessary as an addition to the amended Constitution. However, the same shall be accounted for and will find mention in my report which shall be submitted to the Hon'ble Supreme Court along with the draft Constitution. FIFA's concern with respect to the transition between Constitutions therein stands addressed,” said Justice Nageswara Rao.","FIFA has reiterated that the ‘current elected executive committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is entitled to complete its full term from 2022 to 2026’ The letter signed by Elkhan Mammadov, FIFA’s chief member associations officer and Vahid Kardany, deputy general secretary, member associations, AFC, was emailed to AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey on April 29 earlier this year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123573597,imgsize-411471,width-400,resizemode-4/indian-football.jpg"

Poll Should AIFF prioritize completion of its constitution over starting the new league season? Yes, constitution first No, league season is a priority

: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has submitted before the Supreme Court that it proposes to kickstart the season with the Super Cup or another domestic competition, while the “new league season” is expected to commence from December.Whether the new league continues to be the top-tier Indian Super League (ISL) will depend on Football Sports Development Ltd (FSDL), a subsidiary of Reliance and AIFF’s current marketing partners, taking part and winning the “open, competitive and transparent tender for selection of a commercial partner to conduct the ISL in line with global best practices.”AIFF has told the Supreme Court that it will conclude the process of finalising a marketing partner by October 15.FSDL’s 15-year contract with AIFF ends December 8, 2025, and the marketing partners have agreed to advance the final tranche of the rights fee of Rs 12.5 crore. The company has crucially also waived its contractual Right of First Negotiation and Right to Match.“This collaborative framework represents a significant step forward in the evolution of Indian football as it ensures that no disruption is caused to the footballing ecosystem, that all stakeholders are given clarity, and that the governance of the sport proceeds in conformity with national and international norms,” AIFF and FSDL said in a joint submission before the SC on Thursday.All parties have been asked by the SC to “reflect” on the proposals, and if agreeable, the court will pronounce judgment on Monday.The crucial matter of AIFF’s constitution, with FIFA, the governing body of world football, threatening to suspend India if there’s no definitive order from SC and ratification by the general body before October 30, is also expected to be finalised next week.The AIFF constitution case has been in the apex court since 2017, when the court directed formulation of a new constitution, one that was submitted by former SC Judge Justice L. Nageswara Rao in 2023.For AIFF, its marketing partners waiving its contractual Right of First Negotiation and Right to Match was a big step forward.""As soon as the order is out, we will appoint one of the big five companies to oversee the tender process and float the tender by September 15,” said a senior official.“A month later, we will have the marketing partners in place, and they will be asked to start the league in December. FSDL giving up its right to match was a big win (for an open and transparent process). If they could match, there was no point in issuing a global tender since not many would have participated.”","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has submitted before the Supreme Court that it proposes to kickstart the season with the Super Cup or another domestic competition.

The Champions League draw for the 36-team league phase will take place in Monaco on Thursday, with defending champions Paris Saint-Germain looking to retain their title after their historic 5-0 victory over Inter Milan in last season's final in Munich. The new format, introduced last season, replaced the traditional group stage with a single league where teams play eight different opponents.PSG finished 15th in the league phase before going on to win the tournament, defeating first-placed Liverpool on penalties in the last 16. They went on to become only the second French team to win the trophy after Marseille's 1993 triumph.""Last season we fulfilled the objective which everybody connected to the club had been dreaming about. But we want to keep on making history and now that would mean winning two Champions Leagues in a row. That is our objective. Last season nobody thought we were capable of winning it and we showed that we were. The dream is to win it again. We know it will be very difficult, but we are delighted to have that as a dream,"" said PSG coach Luis Enrique.PSG's victory ended a 20-year dominance by teams from England, Spain, Germany, and Italy.These four nations still maintain their strong presence with 19 of the 36 teams, including six English clubs thanks to Tottenham Hotspur's Europa League victory.The competition now features teams from only 16 countries out of UEFA's 55 member associations, with three teams coming from France.Only half of the teams in Thursday's draw participated in last season's league phase, bringing fresh faces to the competition.Kairat Almaty from Kazakhstan qualified by defeating Celtic in the play-offs, becoming only the second team from their country to reach the Champions League proper after Astana.Norwegian club Bodo/Glimt qualified for the first time, marking Norway's return to the competition since Rosenborg's appearance in 2007/08.Union Saint-Gilloise secured their first-ever Champions League qualification after winning their first Belgian title in 90 years.Cypriot champions Pafos, featuring former Chelsea and PSG defender David Luiz, also qualified for the first time.""We are the black sheep of the Champions League and the expectation is that we will suffer and lose games, but we will fight, compete and just enjoy the journey,"" said Pafos coach Juan Carlos Carcedo.While Liverpool's top finish in the league phase didn't lead to ultimate success, the next three teams - Barcelona, Arsenal, and Inter - all reached the semi-finals.The financial rewards for Champions League participation have reached new heights, with UEFA projecting total prize money of nearly 2.5 billion euros.Winners can earn over 100 million euros in prize money alone, with additional millions from television rights and coefficient ranking. PSG reportedly earned close to 150 million euros from their victory last season.The final will be played in Budapest, which lies 5,800km west of Almaty by land.The Champions League draw will take place on Thursday August 28, 2025. It will be held in Monaco.The Champions League draw will take place at 9:30pm IST (6pm CET/11pm ET/4pm GMT/5pm UK).Last year the entire draw and award ceremony took 75 minutes to complete so brace yourself as 36 teams get their place in the league phase draw.Each team will be drawn to play eight fixtures, facing two opponents from every pot.Teams from the same country cannot face each other, so Real Madrid cannot play Barcelona.There can be at most two matches against clubs from the same country. For example, Liverpool could be drawn against Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich, but would then be ineligible to face Eintracht Frankfurt.Pot One: Paris Saint-Germain (FRA) - reigning champions, Real Madrid (ESP), Manchester City (ENG), Bayern Munich (GER), Liverpool (ENG), Inter Milan (ITA), Chelsea (ENG), Borussia Dortmund (GER), Barcelona (ESP)Pot Two: Arsenal (ENG), Bayer Leverkusen (GER), Atletico Madrid (ESP), Benfica (POR), Atalanta (ITA), Villarreal (ESP), Juventus (ITA), Eintracht Frankfurt (GER), Club Brugge (BEL)Pot Three: Tottenham Hotspur (ENG), PSV Eindhoven (NED), Ajax (NED), Napoli (ITA), Sporting (POR), Olympiakos (GRE), Slavia Prague (CZE), Bodo/Glimt (NOR), Marseille (FRA)Pot Four: FC Copenhagen (DEN), Monaco (FRA), Galatasaray (TUR), Union Saint-Gilloise (BEL), Qarabag (AZE), Athletic Bilbao (ESP), Newcastle United (ENG), Pafos (CYP), Kairat Almaty (KAZ)The Champions League draw will be LIVE on Sony Network on TV in India and on SonyLiv for live streaming.",UEFA Champions League draw will take place on August 28. 36 teams will be drawn to play eight matches in the league phase.

AFC seeks factual report on ISL

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) is hoping the Supreme Court on Thursday will help break the impasse that has brought Indian football to a standstill, with a threat of FIFA suspension looming.The world governing body and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) jointly sent a letter to AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey on Tuesday expressing “profound concern” at the continued failure to finalise and implement the revised constitution, “a matter that has remained under consideration since proceedings before the Supreme Court of India in 2017.”Despite repeated assurances, the letter notes, “the absence of a clear and compliant governance framework has now created an untenable vacuum and legal uncertainties at the heart of Indian football.”FIFA has given AIFF a deadline of Oct 30 to secure a definitive order from the Supreme Court approving the revised AIFF constitution and then get it ratified by the general body. Failure to adhere to this schedule “may result in sanctions outlined in the FIFA and AFC Statutes, including the possibility of suspension.”AIFF has also been reminded of its “obligation to manage its affairs independently and without any undue third-party influence, including government bodies.”Should FIFA suspend India, it will be the second such ban in three years. The world body also suspended India on Aug 16, 2022, for third-party influence because a SC-appointed committee of administrators was running the federation. The ban was lifted 10 days later, paving the way for elections in which Kalyan Chaubey defeated former India captain Bhaichung Bhutia for the top post.Suspension means the national team will be barred from international tournaments — crucially the Asian Cup 2027 final-round qualifiers — while clubs like Mohun Bagan Super Giant and FC Goa will be scratched out midway into the group stages of the AFC Champions League Two, Asian football’s second-tier club competition.“At the last hearing in the Supreme Court, it was mentioned that the order (on the draft constitution) is ready, but it was not pronounced to ensure that it’s in sync with the recently-enacted National Sports Act. We are hoping it’s only a matter of time before the order is out,” said a senior official.Once the Supreme Court gives the order, the AIFF will ensure that it aligns with mandatory provisions of FIFA and AFC Statutes and regulations. According to sources, the federation is expected to convene a general body meeting to ratify the constitution on Oct 14, when India hosts Singapore in the AFC Asian Cup 2027 final-round qualifiers.In a letter to AIFF deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan, AFC general secretary Datuk Seri Windsor John has sought a factual report on the top-tier Indian Super League (ISL), clarifying the status of commercial negotiations with its marketing partners, the timeline of Supreme Court ruling, impact on affected clubs and stakeholders, and concrete measures being taken to resume the league and safeguard stability.The AFC has said the indefinite suspension of India’s top league is “deeply concerning.”","FIFA has given AIFF a deadline of Oct 30 to secure a definitive order from the Supreme Court approving the revised AIFF constitution.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor. Massive congratulations. You are the future of this sport.”Recalling Barnard’s maiden pole, a fan also wrote, “Fantastic season, Taylor, we'll never forget that Monaco pole.”Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Barnard claimed five podiums in his first full season in Formula E.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

Jelena Ostapenko (L) and Taylor Townsend (R) had a heated exchange after their second round match at the US Open. It spilled over into the press and social media.

Jelena Ostapenko lost her cool and waded into her opponent Taylor Townsend after the American put her out of the US Open.“She told me I have no education, no class, and to see what happens if we play each other outside of the US. I said, ""I'm excited, bring it,” said the left-hander, ranked 139 in singles and No.1 in doubles. “I've never been one to back down from anything like that. If I show respect to you, I expect respect as well. It was unfortunate, but it's something I can put on my TikTok!”The heavy-striking Latvian took exception to Townsend not apologizing for a net cord.It all happened out on Court No.11 after the 29-year-old knocked out Ostapenko 7-5, 6-1.Townsend was all smiles when she came into the press. “Hi everybody! This is the type of day y'all live for,” she said.Ostapenko, the 25th seed, and Townsend have clashed twice in singles and a bunch of times in doubles. Most recently in the Wimbledon semi-finals, where Townsend and Katerina Siniakova, the top-seeds, were edged out. Their singles head-to-head coming into Wednesday’s meeting was locked at 1-1.After the match Ostapenko took to Social Media to make her point.“Today after the match I told my opponent that she was very disrespectful as she had a net ball in a very deciding moment and didn't say sorry. Her answer was that she doesn't have to say sorry at all.” Ostapenko added, “In the beginning of the match all players are supposed to start warming up (from) the baseline. This opponent starts the warm up at the net which is very disrespectful. ”Townsend pointed out that while she was stumped by the net cord herself, this is the way she always warms-up.“I stood up for myself,” said Townsend, the mother of four-year-old Adyn Aubrey. “I (was conscious) of how I (came across) and if my son were to see this interaction, how he would view it. I think he would be proud of the way I handled the situation. The thing that I'm the most proud of is that I let my racquet talk.”Townsend’s mixed-doubles partner Ben Shelton applauded her. “Not the smartest thing to say to an American in New York City,” he said.Words like ‘sore loser’, ‘poor sportsmanship’ floated around the grounds, fingers pointing at the mercurial Ostapenko.World No.1 Aryna Sabalenaka, while not making excuses for the 28-year-old, threw her arms around Ostapenko, saying she can lose control over her emotions.“She has some struggles she is facing. Sometimes when you struggle in life, it can reflect in your tennis, on the court you're more unstable,” said Sabalenka, who made time to speak to the Latvian. “I was just trying to help her to face it in a mature way. So she has someone she could speak to and let it out.”Carlos Alcaraz’s mixed-doubles partner Emma Raducanu weighed in on tennis’ NewsHour debate on the Spaniard’s clipper cut.“He owns it, I think he pulls it off,” the Briton said. “If you own a haircut like that, it can work.”Raducanu, 22, said reactions to the cut were a mixed field.“But whatever he does, it's not going to affect what he does on the court,” she said. “I'm just happy to see him having fun with whatever.”Alcaraz’ rival and world No.1 Jannik Sinner thinks everything suits the Spaniard.“It grows very fast, it's going to be all aligned in two days,” the 24-year-old Italian said. “But it suits him. Even like this, it looks good. When he has longer hair too, it suits him.”Meanwhile Frances Tiafoe flipped things around and joined the list of people who like Alcaraz’s haircut.“It looks better today,” Tiafoe said. “His hair does grow really fast. But at this point it's just comedy. It's just pure comedy, and I hope it continues, the back and forth. Again, as I said, that's my guy.”","Jelena Ostapenko lost her cool and waded into her opponent Taylor Townsend after the American put her out of the US Open.

Ruud falls

Poll Do you think Novak Djokovic can regain his top form at the US Open? Yes, he will bounce back No, his best days are behind him

The precision remains – 10 aces and 48 winners in his second round outing -- but the spark that once lit Novak Djokovic ’s challenge feels faint.The Serb may have won his opening two matches at the US Open, but the No. 7 seed looked oddly flat, disconnected from the vibrant current that powers his game. He wasn’t at war with his box -- though he did gesture in their direction. It was the same with the crowd, he wasn’t sparring with them, or the umpire, with whom there was brief exchanges. It’s not so much about his groundstrokes -- still solid, the backhand especially, bruising when he’s letting it rip from the corners – it’s about his energy.At times, between points or when seated during changeovers, it appeared as if the 24-time major winner was reminding himself of who he is and where he was.The Serb, tennis’ Greatest Of All Time, clarified, motivation wasn’t a factor.“I’m a bit frustrated with my game, because of which I go through stuff internally,” he said. “I'm just trying to be locked in, trying to solve the riddle once I'm on the court. It's not like I'm not finding joy on the court competing.I enjoy competing, but I don't enjoy not playing well.”On Sunday night, in his first match since the Wimbledon semi-finals, playing the 19-year-old American Learner Tien, Djokovic struggled with his footwork. Two days later, when he opened the day session on Ashe, the 38-year-old’s focus wavered against American qualifier Zachary Svajda. Djokovic did enough to seal a 6-7(5), 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 win to advance to the third round of a Grand Slam for a record 75th time.“Today was a little bit of a struggle to find rhythm,” Djokovic said of his clash against Svajda, who was treated by the trainer after the second set. “That's why maybe you haven't seen me be so pumped after winning points and stuff.”“It's about trying to make the most of that day and find a way to win. You have days like this where you're not playing at your best, but you just kind of find a way,” the four-time US Open champion said. “Not to get too philosophical about it, I still love the feeling of competition, the drive that I feel on the court. I get really hard on myself a lot of the time because I expect myself to always play at the highest level.”He added, “I still have the desire to compete with the young guys. Otherwise I wouldn't be here playing.”Next up for Djokovic, looking for a historic 25major title, is Briton Cameron Norrie.Casper Ruud, a three-time Grand Slam finalist, including a run to the US Open final in 2022, is grappling with confidence issues.The 26-year-old, led by two-sets-to-one, and won 11 points more than his opponent in the total count, but ultimately fell to Belgium’s Raphael Collignon 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 5-7 in three-hours and 34-minutes.“The feeling of miss-hitting a lot of shots, hitting a lot of frames on my forehand which is supposed to be my best shot. It’s not a good feeling,” the 12seed said. “When you hit three frames out of five shots, you are not bursting with confidence playing the sixth shot. It’s a little bit that and my shots don’t go where I want them to go. I don’t have a bigger explanation than that.”He added, “I don’t play with much confidence these days.”Meanwhile the fifth seed Jack Draper withdrew from the tournament. Draper, semifinalist in 2024, arrived in New York having not played a match since Wimbledon due to bone stress and bruising in his left humerus. His opponent Zizou Bergs moves into the third round of the US Open for the first time.","Novak Djokovic beats American qualifier Zachary Svajda 6-7(5), 6-3, 6-1, 6 -1.

What else happened at the US Open on Day 4?

Lets start with what happened on the court. On Day 4 of the US Open, Aryna Sabalenka drew play to a close with a straight sets win over Polina Kudermetova. The Belarussian's 7-6, 6-2 win extended her tiebreak record this year to 19-1.“I was super tight. Glad I was able to handle the pressure and put it back to her. The second set I felt much better on the return game and I’m glad I stayed really strong. I try to stay aggressive. I try to fight for every point,” she said on her mindset.The defending champion will next face 2021 US Open finalist Leylah Fernandez. They had met in that edition with the Canadian winning their semi-final. However, a lot has changed since then.A lot has changed for Novak Djokovic also. For the second straight round he appeared sluggish, bit off the mark, touch slow. But for a second straight round, he found an answer, solved the puzzle and progressed to the third round Four-time US Open champion Djokovic improved to 36-0 across the first and second rounds in New York by coming from a set down to beat 145th-ranked American qualifier Zachary Svajda 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-3, 6-1.Carlos Alcaraz was apologetic after his second round win as the quick match - just an hour and 36 minutes worth - robbed the fans more time to marvelled by his exquisite skills.Alcaraz, who could meet Djokovic in the semi-finals, blew away Italy's Mattia Bellucci 6-1, 6-0, 6-3. The Spaniard produced 32 winners in a one-sided contest that gave away nothing. USA's Taylor Townsend and Latvia's Jelena Ostapenko had a terse exchange following their contest on Court 11. Shortly after Townsend won 7-5, 6-1, the 2017 French Open champion Ostapenko reportedly told the American that she has ""no class"" and ""no education.""""She told me 'I have no education', no class, and to see what happens if we play each other outside of the US. I said, I'm excited. Bring it.' I've never been the one to back down from anything like that,” said Townsend in the press conference.A reporter then asked Townsend, who is Black, whether she thought there were racial undertones to it.“I didn't take it in that way, but also, you know, that has been a stigma in our community of being not educated' and all of the things, when it's the furthest thing from the truth,” Townsend responded. “So whether it had racial undertones or not, that's something she can speak on.""And speak on it Ospatenko did. In an Instagram Story, Ostapenko said she received “many messages ... that I am a racist.”“I was NEVER racist in my life and I respect all nations of people in the world. For me it doesn't matter where you come from,” she continued.The bone of contention, as per Ostapenko, who wagged her finger at Townsend as they spoke at the net, was that the top-ranked doubles player was ""disrespectful"" for not saying ""sorry"" after being helped by a net cord during a point.“There are some rules in tennis which most of the players follow and it was (the) first time ever that this happened to me on tour,” Ostapenko posted. “If she plays in her homeland, it doesn't mean that she can behave and do whatever she wants.”As far as mic drop moments go, though, Townsend saved it for the last. “The thing that I'm the most proud of is that I let my racket talk. Because ultimately, I'm the one here, sitting in front of you guys, moving on to the next round, getting the next check. (While) She's packed up and she's gone.”It was inevitable. It had crossed a line and even other 'bad boys' of tennis agreed . Daniil Medvedev was fined $42,500 - more than a third of his $110,000 tournament prize money for a massive meltdown on Day 1 of the US Open.Tournament referee Jake Garner fined Medvedev $30,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct and another $12,500 for racket abuse.The Russian was incensed when a photographer walked onto the court during the match. He berated chair umpire Greg Allensworth for giving Benjamin Bonzi a first serve on match point as the cameraperson interrupted play by walking on court.The 2021 US Open champion spurred the crowd into loud jeers that resulted in an over six minute delay.“He (chair umpire) wants to go home, guys. He doesn’t like to be here. He gets paid by the match, not by the hour,” Medvedev shouted into the microphones behind the chair.Eventually, when the match ended, Medvedev repeatedly smacked his racket against the chair, destroying the equipment.Carlos Alcaraz has made more headlines with his haircut than with his tennis this week. His buzz cut on Sunday has divided opinions. Frances Tiafoe didn't like it. Naomi Osaka was non-commital. Golfer Rory McIlroy said he 'liked it.'Emma Raducanu became the latest to offer her opinion. “I think Frances was harsh on him. I think the fact that he does it with confidence and owns it… I think he pulls it off. I’d say support him,” said Raducanu with a laugh after her second round win “If you can own a haircut like that you can make it work. Mixed field, but whatever he does, it’s not gonna affect what he does on the court. I’m just happy to see him having fun with whatever,” she continued.Fifth seed Jack Draper, a semifinalist in 2024, withdrew because of a lingering injury to his left arm. Other noteable winners included: Jessica Pegula, Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, Frances Tiafoe, 2021 champion Emma Raducanu, Emma Navarro while Casper Ruud bowed out.Belgium's Raphael Collignon, who had never won a match at a major before this, beat Ruud 6-4, 3-6, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5. It was also 107th ranked Collignon's first-ever five-setter.",Aryna Sabalenka and Carlos Alcaraz advanced at the US Open on Day 4. Novak Djokovic overcame a slow start to reach the third round.

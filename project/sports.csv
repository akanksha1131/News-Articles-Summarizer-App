NEW DELHI: Grandmaster R Praggnanandhaa won the Tata Steel Masters chess event on Sunday in Wijk Aan Zee, Netherlands, after rallying from behind to defeat world champion D. Gukesh 2-1 in the tiebreaker.After finishing the 13th and final round of the competition tied for first place with 8.5 points apiece, there was the usual drama that comes with two young players trying to win every tiebreak match.Both of the young players lost shockingly in the last round after captivating the chess enthusiasts with their aggressive and inventive play over the past few days to lead the group.Praggnanandhaa also suffered a surprising setback against Germany's Vincent Keymer, while Gukesh lost to fellow countryman Arjun Erigaisi. However, they both managed to maintain their joint-leading position with 5.5 points apiece.In the opening game of the tiebreak, Praggnanandhaa met Benoni in reverse colors, and it appeared that he had easily equalized in the middle game. But Praggnanandhaa made a mistake that cost him a full rook, and Gukesh had other ideas as he continued to try and prevailed.Praggnanandhaa used the Trompowsky opening in the second game of the tiebreaker, which Gukesh had to win, and this time he had a small edge with his black pieces.By simply holding his position, Praggnanandhaa calmly waited and took advantage of an unintentional mistake made by his opponent to first knock down a pawn. His technical skills were subsequently sufficient to win the typical blitz games 1-1.Praggnanandhaa drew white as a result, and Gukesh once again outplayed him with some creative play on the queen side, winning him a pawn. This put the match in sudden death.Praggnanandhaa attempted to defend a weaker ending despite the sudden-death having a time limit of two minutes and thirty seconds for white and three for black.Gukesh lost total control in the battle of nerves and lost a piece and then his lone knight just as the position appeared to be absolutely drawn and another game was imminent.With flawless technique, Praggnanandhaa won his first Masters title and the entire point.Gukesh lost the tiebreaker after tying for top place for the second consecutive year.

NEW DELHI: The Dubai Capitals defeated the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders by an incredible 26 runs on Sunday at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, thanks to David Warner 's brilliant batting, which sent them into the ILT20 Season 3 playoffs. The Dubai Capitals secured their playoffs berth with the victory, making them the fourth and final team to do so.In his season-opening game, Warner was the game-changer, leading the Dubai Capitals to their sixth victory in seven games against the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders with an incredible undefeated 93.The Knight Riders had a difficult time chasing a high total of 218 because they needed to win the match outright to be in the running. Their batters started off cagey, but once they got going, they were unstoppable. At the conclusion of the powerplay, Andries Gous led his team to 50/0 after smashing six boundaries in 11 deliveries. Kyle Mayers put some clutch boundaries after setting the pace for the chase.The Knight Riders appeared well-positioned at 89/0 at the midway point, with both batters blazing, and Gous and Mayers formed the cornerstone of their pursuit. But Gulbadin Naib outwitted Mayers with a brilliant bowling change, giving the Capitals a way back into the match. Naib bounced back from being struck for a huge six in the previous ball to deceive Mayers with a slower delivery, preventing the West Indian from reaching 50 after falling for an incredible 42 off 29.Gous was on 55 when Joe Clarke joined him, and the American stepped it up. The Knight Riders reached 122/1 in 13 overs and required 96 runs from the last 42 deliveries when he hit two consecutive sixes off Ahmad, the first over long-on and the second straight over the bowler's head.The big-hitting Andre Russell took Clarke's place after he retired injured shortly after smashing an incredible 91-meter six over long-on. But following a brilliant 17th over from Dushmantha Chameera , the Knight Riders unexpectedly had two fresh batters at the crease, and the momentum shifted in the Capitals' favor. The first player out was Gous, who was caught at mid-wicket for a 78 off 47 while attempting to reach a maximum. The West Indian was out on his first ball, proving that the Knight Riders' plan to retire Clarke and bring on Russell was a failure.The Knight Riders were stuck at 153/5, requiring 65 runs in 18 balls, and David Willey was dismissed after making only one run, giving the Capitals even more cause to celebrate. The Dubai Capitals won by a resounding 26 runs, proving that it was too huge a target to pursue. At the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, this was the first time in seven games that the team batting first had won.Shai Hope and Warner, the Dubai Capitals' openers, both appeared to be in excellent form as they got off to a fast start. Despite Willey's incredible stretch in which he conceded just 11 runs in three overs, the Capitals rushed to 43/0 inside the powerplay as the pair alternated in hitting the boundaries.When Warner holed out in the seventh over, the Knight Riders came very close to winning, but Russell was unable to hold onto the catch. To get underway, Warner took advantage of the reprieve by smashing Gudakesh Motie for four boundaries in the following over. After that, Hope hit two sixes before being bowled by Roston Chase, ending the opening wicket stand at 82 runs.Warner went on to reach his half-century in 33 deliveries, surpassing all other batters in the world with the 116th 50+ score of his career in Twenty20 cricket. The Capitals had 111 runs after 12 overs when the daring Australian attacked the opposition spinners, striking Sunil Narine for a huge six. They were headed for a 200+ total with a good 9+ run rate.Naib raced to 27 runs off 15 deliveries with a couple of huge hits, keeping the scorekeepers busy. Due to poor fielding by the Knight Riders, Alishan Sharafu dropped Naib in the fifteenth over. The Afghan player then hit two huge sixes off Jason Holder to help his team approach a huge total.Naib was removed for an incredible 47 off 25 balls as Narine immediately returned to the attack. After only two deliveries, Rovman Powell was replaced by Dasun Shanaka, who helped the Capitals score even more runs. The Sri Lankan made a spectacular cameo, scoring 17 runs off of only seven balls before destroying Holder in the last over to help the Capitals to a huge 217/4. The Capitals scored the best total in the history of the competition in Dubai, and Warner remained undefeated at 93.","Dubai Capitals defeated the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders by an incredible 26 runs on Sunday at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.

Five-star Arsenal crush woeful Manchester City to keep title bid alive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/five-star-arsenal-crush-woeful-manchester-city-to-keep-title-bid-alive/articleshow/117872856.cms,"NEW DELHI: With a 5-1 thumping of a miserable Manchester City on Sunday, Arsenal maintained their hopes of winning the Premier League title, while the struggling champions suffered yet another setback in their terrible season.Following Liverpool's 2-0 victory over Bournemouth on Saturday, which put them nine points ahead of the Gunners, Mikel Arteta 's team had no room for mistake in the title fight.After 103 seconds at the Emirates Stadium, Martin Odegaard's first goal emboldened them to go on a spectacular display.Shortly after halftime, Erling Haaland scored his 25th goal of the season across all competitions to tie the score for City.However, when Thomas Partey took advantage of Phil Foden's shoddy pass to put Arsenal back ahead, the thoughtless errors that have plagued City over a lackluster season proved to be the difference.Kai Havertz and Ethan Nwaneri's late goals and Myles Lewis-Skelly's debut goal for Arsenal completed a brilliant performance that saw the Gunners get within six points of Liverpool.Although Arsenal's strong performance increased their undefeated streak to 14 games and demonstrated their desire to fight the Reds to the end, Liverpool's game in hand maintains them comfortably in charge of the title race.City's six-game winning streak in the top tier came to a cruel end, and they have now lost all four of their league encounters with Arsenal.After their miserable season, City's hopes of winning a fifth straight crown were long since dashed, and now Pep Guardiola's fourth-place team is concentrating on making it to the Champions League However, unless Guardiola can address the glaring gaps in his defense and the lack of energy in his midfield, even that might be beyond them, let alone defeating Real Madrid in this season's playoff round.Abdukodir Khusanov, a former Lens defender who made a clumsy start against Chelsea last weekend, was replaced by John Stones by Guardiola.Stones, however, was a part of the disastrous defense that gave Arsenal the lead in the second minute.Stones put his fellow defender in a tight spot with a pass to the marked Manuel Akanji.Leandro Trossard robbed Akanji right away, and with City's defense in disarray, Kai Havertz picked out Odegaard, who then slotted home from ten yards out.Guardiola marched thunderously back to the bench, already fearing the worst.The frustrated Guardiola made a variety of furious gestures as a result of City controlling possession but being toothless for extended periods of time.During the tempestuous 2-2 draw earlier this season, Haaland infuriated Arsenal by instructing Arteta to ""stay humble"" and hurling the ball at Gunners defender Gabriel Magalhaes.Unsurprisingly, Haaland scored City's equalizer in the 55th minute.Haaland had the opportunity to sneak in front of William Saliba and bury his close-range header after Savinho's excellently weighted cross.However, it only took Arsenal two minutes to make Haaland stop smiling.After Partey intercepted Foden's pass, the Ghanaian midfielder launched a strong long-range shot that struck Stones with a deft deflection.In the 62nd minute, Lewis-Skelly went for the kill as Arsenal smelt blood.The 18-year-old left-back cut inside the City area and curled a beautiful finish into the far corner with elegance that belied his inexperience.Lewis-Skelly mimicked the City star's contemplative celebration by sitting down with his legs crossed to mark the goal in a playful jab at Haaland.The much-maligned Havertz scored in the 76th minute, adding to the suffering of shell-shocked City.After stomping through City's flimsy defense, Gabriel Martinelli set up Havertz for a clinical 10-yard finish.Nwaneri, a young forward, struck the final punch deep into stoppage time with a brilliant goal into the far corner from a sharp angle.For the second time in a humiliating day, City had no answer to the taunts of ""you're getting sacked in the morning"" from Arsenal supporters directed at Guardiola.","Arsenal maintained their hopes of winning the Premier League title with a 5-1 thumping of a miserable Manchester City. City's six-game winning streak in the top tier came to a cruel end, and they have now lost all four of their league encounters with Arsenal.

Playing with the white pieces, the Indian youngster opened with a King’s Pawn, leading to a classic Italian Game. The early exchanges were sharp, with both players castling by move five.A major turning point came when Gukesh sacrificed Wei’s queen with Qxd8, forcing an immediate response (Rfxd8) from the Chinese grandmaster.As the game approached the endgame phase, both players had a rook each — Gukesh relied on his bishop, while Wei Yi looked to create complications with his knight.However, neither could break through, leading to a handshake and a draw.With this result, Gukesh maintained his position at the top of the Masters standings as the sole leader with 8/11 points.The biggest shock of the round came when Praggnanandhaa outplayed top-seed Caruana in a masterful display. Playing with the black pieces, Pragg responded to Caruana’s English Opening with the Agincourt Defense, gradually seizing control of the board.The battle remained evenly poised until Caruana’s misstep on move 32 (Qe3), which allowed Praggnanandhaa to unleash a devastating knight manoeuvre.Within just five more moves, Pragg had sealed a stunning 37-move victory, handing Caruana another shocking defeat in what has been a topsy-turvey tournament so far for the American.With the aforementioned results on Friday, Gukesh overtook Caruana in the live ratings, securing the World No. 3 spot with 2793.2 Elo points, while Caruana slipped to 2792.4.One of the day’s most intriguing results saw Leon Luke Mendonca secure his first win of the tournament by toppling Vladimir Fedoseev of Slovenia.Fedoseev, having gained popularity as the ""giant killer"" after beating Arjun Erigaisi, Caruana, Vincent Keymer, and Pentala Harikrishna, found himself on the receiving end this time.

NEW DELHI: Railways pacer Himanshu Sangwan became an overnight sensation after dismissing superstar Virat Kohli in a Ranji Trophy match against Delhi at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Friday. In the first session on Day 2, Sangwan bowled a brilliant delivery that shattered Kohli's off-stump, sending the cricketing world into a frenzy.Kohli, who was making his return to domestic cricket after 12 years, had faced 15 balls and scored 6 runs. The delivery from Sangwan was a perfect in-swinger that breached the gap between bat and pad, resulting in the stumps being uprooted.After the game, the fast bowler displayed his admiration by approaching Kohli to take his autograph on a cricket ball. Sangwan later posted this moment through a video on his Instagram handle.This was not the first time Sangwan has showcased his talent. In a 2020 Ranji Trophy match, he dismissed Ajinkya Rahane . His list of high-profile wickets also includes Rinku Singh, Prithvi Shaw, Krunal Pandya, Rajat Patidar, and Devdutt Padikkal.Beyond his on-field achievements, Sangwan balances his cricketing career with his job as a ticket collector at New Delhi Railway Station. He has refined his skills under the mentorship of Australian legend Glenn McGrath at the MRF Pace Academy.""I have never witnessed such a crowd at a Ranji Trophy match, and it was all because of Virat Kohli. People came in huge numbers - it felt nothing short of an international match. The buzz was incredible. Usually, fans come to cheer for players like Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Rohit Sharma, and Virat Kohli. But this match was just about Virat. All I could hear for three days was 'Virat! Virat! Kohli! Kohli!',"" Sangwan told TimesofIndia.com in an interview.""Getting Virat Kohli's wicket was a huge moment for me. I can talk about it, but the feeling is beyond words - I simply can't express it. My aggression was natural. A bowler, especially a fast bowler, never likes when a batter hits him for a four or a six. He played a superb straight drive. As a bowler, I was disappointed.

'One of the worst rules in the game': Sunil Gavaskar on concussion substitute rule,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/england-tour-of-india-2025/one-of-the-worst-rules-in-the-game-sunil-gavaskar-on-concussion-substitute-rule/articleshow/117854690.cms,"NEW DELHI: The selection of Harshit Rana as a concussion substitution for Shivam Dube during the fourth Twenty20 International in Pune, according to legendary Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar , was not like-for-like and detracted from the hosts' victory.Harshit, who is mainly a pacer, took Dube's place after the all-rounder had a concussion while batting in the last over after Jamie Overton struck him on his helmet.Rana, who made his T20I debut, took 3-33 in his four overs and was instrumental in India defending 182 and taking unbeatable series lead. The England captain, Jos Buttler , too voiced his displeasure with the Dube-Rana swap.""In the Pune game, Dube batted right till the end after having got hit on the helmet earlier, so clearly, he was not concussed. So, allowing a concussion substitute itself was not correct. Yes, there could have been a substitute in case he had strained a muscle while batting, but that would have been only for fielding and he could not have bowled.""Even by the most generous stretching of the like-for-like term, there was nothing such between Dube and Rana. With tongue firmly in cheek, one can say that they are the same height and have the same standard in fielding.""Otherwise, there's nothing like-for-like as far as they are concerned. England have every reason to feel done in. This Indian team are a superb team and doesn't need its wins to get tarnished by such acts,"" wrote Gavaskar in his column for mid-day on Sunday.India will look to win the series 4-1 against England in their fifth and final T20I at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.""The recovery from a dire situation to a match-winning score with that partnership between Hardik Pandya and Dube showed why this team are one which will never give up and keep fighting till the end.""If Rana had not taken three wickets and England had gone on to win even then the substitution was wrong and should never have been allowed. It has taken the gloss off the win and India must win in Mumbai to show that they are indeed the better team,"" added Gavaskar.The rule 1.2.7 of ICC's Men's T20I playing guidelines says, ""the ICC Match Referee should ordinarily approve a Concussion Replacement Request if the replacement is a like-for-like player whose inclusion will not excessively advantage his/her team for the remainder of the match.""Sub-sections, 1.2.7.4 and 1.2.7.5, further say, ""in assessing whether the nominated Concussion Replacement should be considered a like-for-like player, the ICC Match Referee should consider the likely role the concussed player would have played during the remainder of the match, and the normal role that would be performed by the nominated Concussion Replacement.""""If the ICC Match Referee believes that the inclusion of the nominated Concussion Replacement, when performing their normal role, would excessively advantage their team, the ICC Match Referee may impose such conditions upon the identity and involvement of the Concussion Replacement as he/she sees fit, in line with the overriding objective of facilitating a like-for-like replacement for the concussed player.""Gavaskar signed off by saying the concussion substitute is 'one of the worst rules in the game'. ""The concussion substitute, which allows teams to bring on a like-for-like replacement on the field, is one of the worst rules in the game. It rewards ineptitude.""If a batter can't play a bouncer and gets hit on the helmet and goes off the field and the team doctor thinks he needs to rest because of concussion, then someone else who is not in the XI who does pretty much what the concussed guy does can replace him. Firstly, if you can't play the bouncer then don't play at the highest level.""Play weekend club cricket and smash the bowlers all round the park to your heart's content. Secondly, if someone breaks a finger or a wrist and obviously cannot take any further part in the game is not allowed a like-for-like replacement, then why allow one for some guy who gets hit on the helmet,"" he concluded.","Harshit Rana took 3-33 in his four overs and was instrumental in India defending 182 and taking unbeatable series lead.

NEW DELHI: Team India on Sunday rewrote the record books by registering their highest-ever Powerplay total in T20Is, smashing 95/1 against England during the fifth and final match at the Wankhede Stadium .The blistering start surpassed their previous best of 82/2 against Scotland in Dubai during the 2021 T20 World Cup.England skipper Jos Buttler won the toss and put India into bat as the tourists look for a consolation win in the fifth T20 international.Right from the first over, Indian openers, Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma , came out with an aggressive intent, taking full advantage of the batting-friendly conditions.The English bowlers had no answers to Abhishek's onslaught, as boundaries flowed freely in all directions. Despite losing Samson (16) early, India kept the momentum going, ensuring their most dominant six-over performance in T20I history.Abhishek's blistering 58 runs off 21 balls in the Powerplay is now the highest by an Indian batter in a T20I, surpassing Yashasvi Jaiswal 's 53 against Australia in Trivandrum in 2023.With the modern T20 game evolving rapidly, such high-scoring starts are becoming a crucial factor in determining the outcome of matches. As Team India continues to dominate the shortest format, their ability to make the most of the Powerplay overs will remain a key strength.Earlier, the visitors made one change in the playing XI following their previous loss, which handed India an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match T20I series.Speedster Mark Wood replaced Saqib Mahmood, despite Mahmood’s impressive performance in the last match, where he took three wickets in his first over without conceding a run.India also made a single change, bringing in fast bowler Mohammed Shami in place of left-arm quick Arshdeep Singh, as they aim to end the series on a high before heading into the three-match ODI series.","Team India register their highest-ever Powerplay total in T20Is, smashing 95/1 against England during the fifth and final match at the Wankhede Stadium.

MUMBAI: Abhishek Sharma isn't yet the darling of corporate companies in terms of endorsements, but his T20 batting graph has risen so sharply since the last IPL that someone will soon queue up at his door step. One just hopes it's an insurance firm, who can secure his sublime hands and quick eye.The Punjab southpaw's rasping bat speed that aids the delicious flow of his willow was on full show on Sunday as a packed Wankhede was treated to surreal batsmanship in the fifth T20I against England.Abhishek's thrill-a-second 135 (54 balls, 7x4, 13x6), the highest by an Indian in T20Is and his second in the format, ensured that hosts, who were put into bat by Jos Buttler got a substantial 247 for 9, despite a wobble in the middle-order.He later came on to bowl and tormented the visitors with a double strike to dismiss Brydon Carse and Jamie Overton as the scoreboard pressure was just too much and England collapsed to 97 all out in 10.3 overs to give India victory by 150 runs, their second biggest in terms of runs in T20Is.During England's chase, Varun Chakravarthy struck twice to end with 14 wickets and be the Player of the Series. The lone spark with the bat for England was provided by Phil Salt , who belted 55 (23 balls, 7x4, 3x6).But it was Abhishek who was the show-stealer. Mentored by one of India's greatest white-ball match winner, Yuvraj Singh, Abhishek has picked up several traits of the former World Cup winner.He times the ball well, picks up length quickly, maintains a steady base and doesn't know the meaning of inhibition. One wonders whether anyone in this Indian T20I team does. Fearlessness runs through their veins. Sanju Samson showed that when he deposited Jofra Archer into the mid-wicket stand off the first ball of the game and repeated the dose three balls later. But the pull shot has been Sanju's bane and Mark Wood got him out to the pull for the fifth time in the series. Rinse and repeat!Abhishek then took over and owned the stage. The faster England bowled, the faster it seemed to ping off the lefthander's bat, especially through the off side.He charged at both Archer and Wood as if they were bowling medium-pace when in reality they were hurling 145-plus rockets.He laced them through cover and point and even lofted them over those regions for maximums. They focused on getting the other batters out after Abhishek blazed away to a 37-ball ton, the second fastest for India.","India beat England by 150 runs in the fifth T20I at Wankhede. Abhishek Sharma scored 135, the highest by an Indian in T20Is. Varun Chakravarthy took 14 wickets and was Player of the Series.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117873761,imgsize-63900,width-400,resizemode-4/117873761.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Falcon Risers Hyderabad secured a thrilling victory in their recent match, thanks to the exceptional performance of their costliest player and renowned death-over specialist , Irfan Umair .Despite facing financial hardships and living at train stations in his pursuit of a cricketing career, Irfan's resilience and hard work paid off as he restricted the opposition to just three runs in the final over, sealing a dramatic win and sparking celebrations in the Hyderabad camp.Irfan's brilliant spell of 2 overs -- 2 wickets for 12 runs earned him the prestigious Gully to Glory Award, helping the Falcons secure their third win in the second edition of the Indian Street Premier League ( ISPL ). Hailing from Ranchi, Jharkhand, Irfan worked odd jobs, including waiting tables and being a sushi chef, to support himself while chasing his cricketing dream.Despite missing ISPL Season 1, Irfan secured a Rs 16.5 lakh contract on his debut in Season 2 after refining his death-over skills during the lockdown while playing tennis-ball cricket for financial stability. Vishal Kalyankar , Falcon Risers Hyderabad's Assistant Coach, discovered Irfan's talent while attending the Delhi Dhamaka Tournament as a Chief Guest, continuing the team's tradition of identifying and elevating tennis-ball cricketers to the top stage at the ISPL.Reflecting on his match-winning final over, Irfan said, ""I am known as a death-over specialist in my team, and my strength remains the same. I trust my game, and I was confident that if my wide-yorker lands well, it's hard to hit. I had full confidence in defending 10 runs. I thank my owners, my team, and the entire performance staff for placing their trust in me. I'm grateful for the opportunity and will continue to give my best in the upcoming matches. As a team, we don't focus on individual performances but on winning together and carrying that momentum forward. Lastly, thanks to my family for their support. To the fans—stay disciplined, work hard, and believe in yourself. There are no shortcuts to success.""A frequent net bowler for MS Dhoni in the past, Irfan now aims to cement his place in professional cricket, proving that resilience and hard work always pay off.After being asked to bat first, Hyderabad overcame a shaky start to post a competitive 84/9, anchored by Vishwajit Thakur's resilient 26 off 19 and Jonty Sarkar's steady 15 off 16. The duo steadied the innings with a crucial 46-run stand after Hyderabad stumbled to 10/4 within the first two overs. Skipper Bablu Patil added late fireworks, ensuring a fighting total.Chetan Padiyar, Head Coach of Falcon Risers Hyderabad, asserted, ""Irfan showed exactly why he is one of the best in high-pressure situations. His ability to execute wide yorkers consistently makes him a game-changer. The way he defended 10 runs in the final over speaks volumes about his mental strength and skill. This win was a total team effort, and we are looking forward to keeping the momentum going.""Vishwajit Thakur, during the post-match presentation after earning his second consecutive Man of the Match award, said, ""I'm really pleased with my performance tonight. The turning point came from Vicky Bhoir's precise bowling, and opting for the 50-50 over in the 7th over was the right call.

Dejected fans leave the stadium after Virat Kohli's early dismissal

NEW DELHI: Abhishek Sharma 's extraordinary performance of 54-ball 135 set new benchmarks, achieving the second-fastest century and highest score by an Indian in T20Is, as India overwhelmed England by 150 runs in the fifth T20I, securing the series 4-1 on Sunday. After England chose to field, Abhishek's aggressive batting propelled India to their highest T20I total against England at 247/9. England collapsed for a mere 97 in 10.3 overs.This victory margin of 150 runs stands as India's second-largest in T20Is, following their 168-run victory over New Zealand in 2023.Despite Phil Salt 's aggressive 23-ball 55, featuring seven fours and three sixes, England's batting lineup faltered at the Wankhede Stadium.Key England batsmen performed poorly, with Ben Duckett (0), Buttler (7), Harry Brook (2) and Liam Livingstone (9) collectively scoring just 18 runs on an excellent batting surface.The lower order offered little resistance. Abhishek continued his dominance by claiming two wickets (2/3) in his sole over, removing Brydon Carse (3) and Jamie Overton (1).Mohammed Shami secured 3/25, Shivam Dube took 2/11, Varun Chakravarthy claimed 2/25, and Ravi Bishnoi finished with 1/9.Abhishek dominated the match with exceptional batting against both pace and spin, establishing multiple records. The 24-year-old achieved his century in 37 balls, making it the second-fastest for India, after initially reaching his fifty in 17 balls.He surpassed the Indian record for most sixes in a T20I innings, hitting his 11th six off Brydon Carse (3/38) in the 17th over, ultimately finishing with 13 sixes.His remarkable innings of 135, including seven fours, surpassed Shubman Gill's previous Indian record of 126 not out against New Zealand at Ahmedabad in 2023.Abhishek's contribution helped India post their highest T20I score against England, exceeding their previous best of 224/2 at Ahmedabad in 2021.This total ranks as India's fourth-highest in T20Is.The left-handed batsman displayed excellent off-side play, consistently finding gaps in the field.He confidently faced Jofra Archer (1/55), playing aggressive shots while maintaining control throughout his innings.A notable moment came when he reached his fifty with a six off Overton's full toss, contributing to India's highest powerplay score of 95/1.Overton's fifth over proved costly, conceding 25 runs including three sixes and a four to Abhishek.While Sanju Samson (16) and Suryakumar Yadav (2) struggled, Tilak Varma (24) and Shivam Dube (30) provided solid support to Abhishek.Varma supported Abhishek in a 115-run second-wicket partnership off 43 balls, while Dube contributed to a quick 37-run fourth-wicket stand off 18 balls.Samson began promisingly, hitting two sixes off Archer in the first over, scoring 14 runs.However, he fell to a short ball from Mark Wood, attempting a pull shot for a 6-ball 16, caught by Archer at backward square leg.Team captain Suryakumar's homecoming at Wankhede Stadium proved disappointing, as he was caught by Phil Salt while attempting his signature leg-side shot.","India beat England by 150 runs in the fifth T20I at the Wankhede Stadium.

BENGALURU: Brownie points rarely sit well on competitive teams and when Karnataka and Haryana shook hands at the stroke of tea, signaling an end to their final league engagement in the Ranji Trophy , it was an affirmation that Karnataka truly deserved to go deeper in this championship.Forces beyond their control in the first phase of the league had conspired to stymie Karnataka’s progress, and while Haryana moved into the quarterfinals as Group C toppers, it was the end of the season for Mayank Agarwal & Co.The last time Karnataka failed to qualify for the knockouts was in 2015-16 when they were two-time defending champions. This season, they were a far better team but still have scope for improvement and growth some of which may have manifested had they continued onward. The spin department will continue to be their biggest worry, and their need to manage talent and resources will remain a challenge.On Sunday, at the M Chinnaswamy stadium , the two sessions of the day largely belonged to one youngster — R Smaran — who is a classic blend of old-school technique and youthful elan. The 21-year-old did his growing reputation no harm by standing tall and anchoring Karnataka to safety of a draw with an unconquered century (133; 127b; 14x2; 2x6). After conceding the first innings lead, the home side finished with 294/8 in 89.5 overs. Karnataka remained fourth in the group with 20 points.Resuming from an overnight 108/3 and still 30 runs in deficit to Haryana’s first innings total of 450 the danger of losing outright was all-pervasive. Karnataka needed the likes of overnight bats Devdutt Padikkal (43), Smaran, KL Shrijith (2) and Hardik Raj (40) to dig deep.Padikkal, who had essayed deft strokes the previous day, was the first to perish, falling in the fifth over of the day. Much like his first innings, the southpaw was again adjudged leg-before. With the disciplined Anshul Kamboj bowling around the wicket, Padikkal played a delivery late and across to end his 40-run association with Smaran. KL Shrijith (2) followed, with Kamboj setting him up beautifully and inducing an uppish drive which went to Yuvraj Singh at covers.Smaran, though, was all intent and focus in the face of Haryana’s determined pursuit of victory. Their bowlers rarely strayed, but Smaran found the gaps and delighted with his sweetly timed cuts and drives. He leaned in to dispatch a delivery through point for a four for his second century of the season. It came off just 149 deliveries.All-rounder Hardik Raj (40) proved an invaluable ally and their defining 98-run association for the seventh kept Haryana from steamrolling the home side.Later reminiscing on what could have been, Agarwal said, “The first two games were washed out leaving us with a point from each. We did our best. I feel that there are a lot of positives (from the season). Yere (Goud, coach) sir and I had a long discussion, and we feel Karnataka is heading in the right direction.”",Karnataka drew with Haryana in their final Ranji Trophy match. The hosts were bowled out for 450 in their first innings. R Smaran scored 133 not out as Karnataka finished on 294/8 in 89.5 overs. Mayank Agarwal's side remained fourth in the group with 20 points.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117860990,imgsize-36630,width-400,resizemode-4/117860990.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Liverpool on Saturday secured a 2-0 victory at Bournemouth with Mohamed Salah 's disputed penalty, extending their lead to nine points in the Premier League The opening goal came through Salah's penalty after Cody Gakpo appeared to fall over his own feet rather than from Lewis Cook's challenge.The decision sparked outrage from Bournemouth after referee Darren England's initial call was supported by VAR.""The referee's call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR – with the challenge deemed to have been a trip by Cook on Gakpo.

Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane has criticised Marcus Rashford , stating that the forward ""must be ashamed"" of his current situation under manager Ruben Amorim .The 27-year-old has not played for United in seven weeks, and Amorim has made it clear that Rashford ""has to change"" if he wants to have a future at Old Trafford. Despite training with the squad ahead of Thursday's Europa League match against Romanian side FCSB, Rashford was left out of the traveling squad.With the transfer window closing at 23:00 GMT on Monday, Rashford has been linked with a potential loan move to Barcelona, but time is running out to finalize a deal.Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane expressed his frustration over Rashford’s situation:""I can't get involved in the conversation, I still can't understand at any level. Whatever's going on with players leaving, months left on contracts, a player who doesn't train properly... I don't understand it.You might as well leave me out of this conversation. Especially if you think he wants to move, which is more of a reason to train properly so when you go to a new club you're up to speed and when you leave the club at least you showed a decent attitude. He must be ashamed.""Fellow United legend Wayne Rooney also shared his thoughts, recalling a recent visit to United’s Carrington training facility :""I went into Carrington on Sunday to take my kids to game day, and Marcus Rashford was out on the training pitch with the fitness coach, but he was right over towards where the parents were walking past for the kids' games.I looked at him thinking how embarrassing it must be for him as parents walk past.""Rooney admitted he had spoken to Rashford and advised him to leave Manchester United in order to revive his career:""I've spoken to Marcus a couple of times and I've given him my thoughts and feelings that he needs to leave the football club because whatever is going on in his life and at Manchester United, he's not the same. For him to have a fresh start, he needs to leave the club.""A product of United’s youth academy, Rashford has scored 138 goals in 426 appearances for the club, including seven goals in 24 games this season. However, a potential move remains complicated due to his reported £300,000-a-week ($374,000) contract, which runs until 2028.",Marcus Rashford has not played for Manchester United in seven weeks.

Manchester City led the way last season with 28 goals in their entire Champions League campaign, including knockout games.7: Liverpool's winning streak stopped at seven games with a 3-2 loss at PSV Eindhoven. That loss meant there were no unbeaten teams in the league phase. Six teams qualified unbeaten from their groups last season.23: The number of games won by a margin of four goals or more. Bayern Munich's 9-2 win over Dinamo Zagreb on the opening night set the tone as one-sided games were more common. Last year only four group games were won by four goals or more.

The hosts, who had taken a commanding 2-0 lead by winning the first two singles on the opening day of the tie on Saturday, completed the formality with two dominant wins - in doubles and singles - on Sunday. The fifth rubber was not played. The World Group 1 tie would be played in September later this year and the name of their opponents would be announced later.The doubles pair of Sriram Balaji and Davis Cup debutant Rithvik Bollipalli put the hosts ahead in the fourth game when they broke M'lapa Akomlo, the substitute for regular player Thomas Setodji who pulled out with an injury. Akomlo proved to be the weak link as the Indians, playing some smart tennis with clever ball placement and strong net presence, broke his service to take the set 6-2. The second set was even shorter as the Indians broke Akomlo and his partner Isak Padio once each to claim the set 6-1. The match lasted 57 minutes.With the tie secured, India gave rookie Karan Singh his Davis Cup debut in the dead rubber and the 21-year-old did not disappoint as he beat Isak, whom Togo fielded in place of original choice Setodji. The 20-year-old in fact put up the best show by a Togolese player on the trip as he stretched most of the games. He even managed to break Singh once in the second set as India won the match 6-2, 6-3 - the first instance when Togo won three games in a set on this tour.""I started playing tennis when I was an 11-year-old and I had no idea how far I would go.

It's a little bit different from the regular matches that we play.""'Grooming future captain'Interestingly, once India won the doubles match and the Playoff, regular captain Rohit Rajpal took a backseat and allowed Mukund Sasikumar occupy the captain's chair during the fourth rubber, played by Karan Singh. The captain's chairs are placed next to the chair umpire so that the players could consult with the captains during game breaks. ""I always do that. Sometimes it's as important as grooming players. Sitting on that chair has a different kind of pressure you need that experience. It's good for them. They'll be the future captains. We'll come and go as seniors, but these guys are here to stay,"" Rajpal said.","India return to the Davis Cup World Group 1 with a comprehensive 4-0 win over Togo in the Playoff.

Elise Mertens secured her first WTA title in 17 months on Sunday, defeating unseeded Ann Li in straight sets to claim the Singapore Tennis Open.The second-seeded Belgian, who had fallen to McCartney Kessler in the Hobart International final last month, showcased her dominance at the Kallang Tennis Centre , winning 75 percent of her first-serve points to overpower the American 6-1, 6-4.Li had not dropped a set en route to the final but struggled with her serve early on, allowing Mertens to capitalize with three service breaks to wrap up the opening set in just 26 minutes.The American was broken again at the start of the second set but responded by breaking Mertens for the first time in the following game, settling into a better rhythm on serve.However, serving to stay in the match at 4-5, Li committed a pair of unforced errors, handing Mertens the victory after one hour and 22 minutes. The win marked Mertens' ninth career WTA singles title and her first since triumphing at the Monastir Open in Tunisia in October 2023.In the doubles final, second seeds Desirae Krawczyk of the United States and Giuliana Olmos of Mexico clinched the title with a commanding 7-5, 6-0 victory over the third-seeded Chinese duo of Wang Xinyu and Zheng Saisai.","Elise Mertens defeated Ann Li 6-1, 6-4 to win the Singapore Tennis Open.

NEW DELHI: N Sriram Balaji and Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli secured India's place in the Davis Cup World Group I with a commanding straight-set victory , handing the hosts an unassailable 3-0 lead against Togo in the play-off tie on Sunday.With a 2-0 advantage, India needed to win just one of the three matches, and the duo of Balaji and Bollipalli accomplished the task in the opening contest against M'lapa Tingou Akomolo and Hod'abalo Isak Padio, winning 6-2, 6-1 in just 57 minutes at the DLTA Complex .Togo replaced their top player, Thomas Setodji, with M'lapa Tingou Akomolo due to an arm injury, which proved detrimental as Akomolo struggled to hold serve throughout the match. Balaji's serving was exceptional, losing only one point on his serve during the entire contest.The Indians gained their first break when Akomolo served in the third game, and from there, it was a one-sided affair. Bollipalli, making his debut, overcame initial nerves and settled into the match, contributing significantly to the victory.The pair's experience of winning a Challenger together last year proved advantageous, as they displayed a straightforward and efficient performance. India is likely to give young Karan Singh a debut in the dead rubber match.Balaji and Bollipalli's convincing straight-set victory sealed India's place in the Davis Cup World Group I, showcasing their dominance and leaving Togo with little chance for a comeback.","N Sriram Balaji and Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli secured India's place in the Davis Cup World Group I with a commanding straight-set victory.

They were tamed in front of 1500-odd fans by India's Mukund Sasikumar and Ramkumar Ramanathan in less than two hours of p lay, in just 29 games, on the DLTA hard court.The contest looked on for the first three games of the first match when Mukund was tested by Liova Ajavon, who even came close to breaking the Indian in the third game.

The captain, however, did not reveal the nature of injury and whether the player would be available for his Sunday's doubles and reverse singles matches.""We played unforced, error-free tennis for the most part,"" Mukund later said.

I stuck to the plan, kept things very simple and did the job that I was supposed to do.""Ramkumar was happy with his service game. ""It was a good serving day. I didn't expect it to be,"" he quipped.

On Sunday:

NEW DELHI: Sasikumar Mukund is set to make a significant return to the Davis Cup as India prepare to face Togo in the World Group I Play-off starting Saturday.Once hailed as a promising talent by tennis legend Leander Paes, Mukund's career faced setbacks due to injuries and controversies, including an unannounced suspension following his Davis Cup debut in September 2023. Now 28 and primarily training in Austria, Mukund is eager to secure his first Davis Cup victory in the absence of Sumit Nagal India enter the tie as firm favorites against the lower-ranked Togo team. Mukund will commence the singles matches against Liova Ayite Ajavon, while Ramkumar Ramanathan is set to face Thomas Setodji, who holds an ATP ranking of 1256.Despite the apparent disparity in rankings, Mukund remains cautious, reflecting on past experiences:""Morocco was not an easy experience and hopefully tomorrow is the chance to redeem myself, and I can get to the finish line. It has been a while since I played in Morocco and I am much fitter and a better player now. I have put in a lot of hard work, in general.""Togo has demonstrated resilience, winning 10 of their last 11 ties, though they have yet to face higher-caliber teams like India. Indian captain Rohit Rajpal emphasizes the importance of not underestimating the opposition:""It's a format based on merit. India had reached the final without being a seeded team. If they have reached the Playoffs, it means they have played at a good level.""In doubles, debutant Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli , who recently entered the top 100 in doubles rankings and competed in the Australian Open, will partner with N. Sriram Balaji. Balaji speaks highly of his partner:""Playing with Rithvik suits me. He will play on the deuce side and I on the ad court side. I like his work ethics.

Subsequently, Warner, who has retired from international cricket, has been appointed the captain of his Big Bash League ( BBL ) team, Sydney Thunder .""Captaining the Thunder again this season means a lot to me,"" said Warner.

MADRID FALTERING

OTHER RESULTS

European heavyweights Real Madrid and Manchester City both suffered big defeats in the Champions League on Tuesday.Defending champions Madrid were humbled 3-1 at home by AC Milan , while Erling Haaland missed a penalty and City squandered a fourth-minute lead as they lost 4-1 at Sporting Lisbon , whose coach will soon take charge of its crosstown rival.It was a much better evening for Liverpool , as Luis Diaz scored a hat trick and Cody Gakpo grabbed another goal in a 4-0 win over German champion Bayer Leverkusen at Anfield that marred Xabi Alonso’s return to his old home.The Leverkusen coach was given a warm welcome on his return to the club where he became a fan favorite as a player over five seasons between 2004-09. Alonso won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2005.Liverpool moved to the top of the league phase table with four wins from four games, followed by Sporting and Monaco, both on 10 points after three wins and a draw. Under the new 36-team format introduced by UEFA this season, the top eight teams advance directly to the next round, and those from ninth to 24th enter playoffs to reach it, while the bottom 12 are eliminated.Before their game, Sporting fans displayed a huge tifo thanking Ruben Amorim in his last home game before he takes over Manchester United.Phil Foden then got City off to a flying start in the fourth minute, only the second goal Sporting have conceded in four games of the competition.But Swedish forward Viktor Gyokeres scored a hat trick as Sporting came roaring back. Gyokeres first equalized in the 38th after a perfect through ball from Geovany Quenda, before Maximiliano Araújo made it 2-1 right after the break. Gyokeres then made it 3-1 from the penalty spot after Josko Gvardiol was penalized for a shove on Francisco Trincão in the area.Haaland’s penalty hit the crossbar, before Gyökeres showed the Norwegian how it’s done with another spot kick at the other end to complete the scoring.It is the first time since 2018 that City have lost three straight games, coming off a defeat to Tottenham in the English League Cup and a loss to Bournemouth in the Premier League.“In my seven and a half years at the club, I don't remember losing three games in a row,” City midfielder Bernardo Silva said.In Spain, Christian Pulisic sent in a corner for Malick Thiaw to head Milan into a 12th-minute lead, ensuring Madrid trailed in a third straight game in the Champions League this season. The 15-time champions had already lost to surprise team Lille in their second game.Vinícius Júnior equalized from the penalty spot in the 23rd after he’d been tripped, but Álvaro Morata pounced on the rebound after Andriy Lunin saved Rafael Leão’s shot to restore the visitors’ lead against his former club.Morata had already been given a hostile reception from the home fans, who evidently remember the goal he scored to take Juventus through to the 2015 final at their team’s expense.Tijjani Reijnders scored Milan’s third goal as the home fans made their frustrations known at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.“The last two defeats are inexplicable. We have to analyze and react quickly,"" Lunin said, referring to Madrid's 4-0 loss to Barcelona in their previous Spanish league game.It's the first time since 2009 that Madrid have lost two successive games at home with at least three goals conceded in each, according to Opta.“We have to get back on track,” Lunin said.German forward Nicolas Kuhn scored twice as Celtic defeated Leipzig 3-1 at home, and Juventus drew 1-1 at Lille.Lille midfielder Edon Zhegrova eluded two defenders before playing a perfect pass for Jonathan David, who fired inside the far post, but Dusan Vlahovic equalized with a penalty for the Italian club.Donyell Malen scored late for Borussia Dortmund to beat Sturm Graz 1-0 at home, and Thilo Kehrer did likewise for Monaco to win at Bologna 1-0.United States midfielder Malik Tillman scored one goal and set up another as PSV Eindhoven beat Spanish team Girona 4-0.Dinamo Zagreb dealt Slovan Bratislava their fourth straight defeat in the competition as the visitors came from behind to win 4-1 in Bratislava.",Real Madrid lose 3-1 at home to AC Milan.

#IPL Retentions: Why No Shreyas Iyer in KKR Doesn't Come As a Surprise

A very charming speaker, Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan is known for his excellent communication skills but the same cannot be said for his Indian Premier League ( IPL ) franchise Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). Even days after the IPL franchises submitted their list of retained players to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), Australia bowler Mitchell Starc is yet to hear from KKR.“I still haven’t heard from them (KKR)...,"" said Mitchell Starc to Australia's Picked up at the mini-auction for Rs 24.75 crore in December 2023, the speedster was Player of the Match in the IPL 2024 final for his spell of 2/14 versus Sunrisers Hyderabad but surprisingly hasn't had any dialogue with the defending champions.TimesofIndia.com reached out to KKR CEO Venky Mysore for a comment but the top boss didn't respond to a text message and chose to press the block button on Whatsapp. KKR's silence towards Starc shouldn't come as a surprise considering the franchise followed a similar approach with captain Shreyas Iyer too.As we had reported last week , KKR had their first chat with Shreyas only three days before the IPL retentions deadline. Prior to the chat on October 27, no one at KKR had reached out to the player who led them to their third IPL title.Word on the street was that Shreyas was looking at a high retainer fee but even for that to happen, the two parties had to engage in timely discussions but that wasn't the case. KKR were always looking at the likes of Andre Russell (Rs 12 crore) and Sunil Narine (Rs 12 crore) as first choices and they got the second-best price tag. Rinku Singh was top retention at Rs 13 crore and uncapped players Harshit Rana and Ramandeep Singh were retained for Rs 4 crore each.KKR CEO, in an interaction with the team's official website, maintained they ""engaged in conversations"" but latest revelation by Starc and the Iyer episode suggest otherwise.""First and foremost, I think our approach has always been to maintain transparency and have proper conversations with everyone. I've not only had conversations with the six we have retained, but I have also engaged in conversations with the ones we couldn't retain. Obviously I am aware of some of the narratives that have been going around. It’s sufficient to say that, we always engage in talks with everyone and most people understand our position,"" Mysore was quoted by KKR.in. Shreyas will now enter the IPL mega auction and is already attracting a lot of interest from leading franchises for a leadership role.",Mitchell Starc is yet to hear from Kolkata Knight Riders. Starc was Player of the Match in the IPL 2024 final for his spell of 2/14. KKR's silence towards Starc shouldn't come as a surprise considering the franchise followed a similar approach with captain Shreyas Iyer too.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114972089,imgsize-118360,width-400,resizemode-4/114972089.jpg"

MUMBAI: In a controversial, yet audacious decision, Mumbai have dropped opener Prithvi Shaw on ""fitness grounds"" during their ongoing campaign in the Ranji Trophy The 24-year-old batsman, who recently uploaded a video of himself toiling in the gym, was given a 'break' for the last match against Tripura at Agartala, and will also remain absent from the defending champions' next fixture against Odisha at the Sharad Pawar Cricket Academy in BKC from Wednesday. It's understood that Shaw has been prescribed a rigorous regimen to reduce excess weight.Following Mumbai's practice session at BKC on Tuesday, Mumbai's bowling mentor, former India pacer Dhawal Kulkarni emphasised that despite his omission, the team maintains faith in the swashbuckling batsman's ability. ""Yes, fitness is paramount. We, as a team, want to see him flourishing, and it's beneficial for himself that he's working on his fitness. He's one of the finest players Mumbai has ever produced. And he's steadily progressing (fitness),"" Kulkarni told TOI.In a match they must win to maintain their knockout prospects, Mumbai will be strengthened by the return of batsman Shreyas Iyer , after he bypassed the Tripura match to rest his shoulder. During his last appearance at BKC, Shreyas had notched his maiden century against Maharashtra last month.""Certainly, Shreyas' return is a significant boost for us. He scored a hundred at this venue. He's back and batting splendidly in the nets,"" Kulkarni said.Positioned fourth in a relatively modest Elite Group A, Mumbai has experienced an inconsistent Ranji campaign thus far. They began with a setback against Baroda on a spinning track in Vadodara, before vanquishing Maharashtra at home at BKC and then unexpectedly drawing their match against Tripura at Agartala. With nine points accumulated, they're earnestly hoping for two outright victories against Odisha at home and subsequently against Services at the Palam ground in New Delhi from November 13, before the Ranji pauses for the Mushtaq Ali T20 and Vijay Hazare Trophy tournaments.""Indeed, it's been an erratic campaign. As champions, we invariably aim to finish atop. Home fixtures are crucial for outright wins. We consider this a vital game. There's another match afterwards, followed by SMAT. Hence, it's essential to conclude strongly in the next two matches. If we excel here, and players maintain form, that advantages us heading into SMAT,"" Kulkarni said.According to sources, MCA's BKC curator Nadim Memon has prepared a greenish wicket, suggesting Mumbai's pacers Shardul Thakur, Mohit Avasthi, Royston Dias and possibly Juned Khan will be expected to deliver, reminiscent of their performance in March during the Ranji Trophy semifinals at this venue, when they dismantled Tamil Nadu for 146 on Day One.Confronting Mumbai in Mumbai presents a huge challenge for Surendra Bhave coached Odisha, currently occupying the 7th position in Elite Group A. However, their captain, Govinda Poddar, remained undaunted.""There are several prominent names in the Mumbai team, including Shreyas Iyer, Shardul Thakur and Ajinkya Rahane . But notably, we defeated Mumbai in the Vijay Hazare Trophy at Bengaluru last year. Undoubtedly, in the Ranji Trophy, in red-ball cricket, Mumbai are formidable. However, the superior team on match day will prevail,"" Poddar asserted.",Mumbai drop Prithvi Shaw on 'fitness grounds' in Ranji Trophy. The 24-year-old batsman was given a 'break' for the last match against Tripura. He will also remain absent from the defending champions' next fixture against Odisha at the Sharad Pawar Cricket Academy in BKC.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114999486,imgsize-27722,width-400,resizemode-4/114999486.jpg"

With his legbreak, he not only picked up four wickets against Haryana but also troubled the Karnataka batters and got rid of players like Mayank Agarwal and Manish Pandey among others.However, the visitors won’t be in any mood to make it easy for the hosts.

Rajasthan Cricket Association bows to Deepak Hooda’s demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/rajasthan-cricket-association-bows-to-deepak-hoodas-demand/articleshow/114988976.cms,"JAIPUR: The issue of team selection has sparked internal conflict between Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) ad hoc committee and captain Deepak Hooda . What became the point of contention was the committee's stance on Hooda’s choice of players, particularly Kunal Singh Rathore who was left out of the team for the fourth match.Displeased with the 16-member squad announced on late Monday evening, Hooda and vice-captain Deepak Chahar resigned from their positions. As the situation took a more serious turn, the management was forced to beat a hasty retreat and conceded to Hooda’s demand by including Rathore in the squad on the eve of their Elite Group B Ranji Trophy match against Hyderabad at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium here on Wednesday.It has been learnt that Hooda communicated to the management that he is unwilling to lead the side but he was requested by the ad hoc panel to continue at least for the game against Hyderabad.“The senior players disapproved of certain players and it has been learnt that the squad released was not the same as it was discussed by the selectors and the captain. There are a few names which have made a back door entry in the squad and that did not go down well with the senior players. It's a good sign that this time all the seniors have raised their voice against such corrupt practices which are not new at the RCA. I hope Hooda and Chahar continue as the captain and as the vice-captain and the matter is addressed by the state sports minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore,” said a source privy to the development.Ad hoc committee member Dharmveer Singh Shekhawat denied receiving resignation from both Hooda and Chahar.”Nothing like this happened. Yes, Rathore was not included in the official squad because he doesn’t have any performance to show. So we thought of giving another wicketkeeper batsman Rajkumar Saini a chance who has done well in the Challenger Trophy and Colvin Shield,” he said.Shekhawat added that on Hooda’s request they added Rathore back as the skipper did not want to experiment with any player at this stage of the tournament.“Hooda told us that the fourth game is a crucial one and he can’t afford to bring in a new batsman. He added that he won’t be able to captain the side if his choice of players are not there. Hooda also said that he is looking for stability in the side. I feel he is right in his thinking,” Shekhawat stated.Ad hoc panel coordinator Jaideep Bihani also cited lack of runs to justify initial exclusion of Rathore from the squad.Moreover, a similar story unfolded in the previous match against Gujarat when middle-order batsman Salman Khan failed to find a place in the squad, but was later included after the captain’s insistence.The entire functioning of the RCA ad hoc panel also reflects poorly on the selection committee which is apparently being arm-twisted by ‘the people at the higher level’.In this backdrop, how the team will gather itself to face Hyderabad will be interesting to see. Rajasthan are currently placed fourth in their group with 10 points that includes two draws and a solitary win.Squad: Deepak Hooda (captain),Deepak Chahar (vice-captain), Mahipal Lomror, Bharat Sharma, Abhijeet Tomar, Ram Mohan Chauhan, Kanhaiya Lal Swami, Ajay Singh Kookna, Arafat Khan, Aniket Choudhary, Zuber Ali, Rajesh Bishnoi (Junior), Shubham Garhwal, Sahil Dewan, Rajkumar Saini, Rajveer Singh and Kunal Singh Rathore.","The issue of team selection has sparked internal conflict between Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) ad hoc committee and captain Deepak Hooda. What became the point of contention was the committee's stance on Hooda’s choice of players, particularly Kunal Singh Rathore who was left out of the team for the fourth match.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114988956,imgsize-63002,width-400,resizemode-4/114988956.jpg"

After three rounds of Ranji Trophy matches this season, Assam are languishing at the bottom of Group D with just a point in their kitty. Hence, any hopes of qualification for the knockouts will require the Denish Das-led team to get their act together when Tamil Nadu come calling in their fourth fixture in Guwahati, starting Wednesday.While the hosts lost their last two matches against Delhi and Chandigarh respectively, their only point is courtesy a hard-fought draw against Jharkhand.On the other hand, Tamil Nadu clinched a spot in third position on the group table after allrounder Vijay Shankar ’s 10th first-class century earned them a crucial draw against Chhattisgarh in their third-round encounter.With it, the Sai Kishore-led visitors to Guwahati now have 11 points, with Railways and Chandigarh the two teams placed above them.In absence of India international Riyan Parag, who is currently undergoing treatment at BCCI Centre of Excellence for a chronic injury to his right shoulder, the home team will have their task cut out against their heavyweights opponents in this round.Making up for Parag’s absence in the squad is Sumit Ghadigaonkar who held fort for Assam in both innings against Delhi, despite his 162 in first innings and an unbeaten 76 in the second going in vain.The 32-year-old is originally from Mumbai and has plied his trade as an overseas professional in Sri Lanka’s domestic cricket in the 2019-20 season.His foray into Indian domestic cricket came as late as last season when the Reserve Bank of India employee began playing for Assam, where he has been based for the last two years for his job.His presence has proved to be a boon for Assam this season, although he has failed to get his teammates’ support to turn his knocks into victories for his team.

"New Zealand’s 3-0 victory in India driven by preparation and adaptability, says Ajaz Patel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/new-zealand-in-india/new-zealands-3-0-victory-in-india-driven-by-preparation-and-adaptability-says-ajaz-patel/articleshow/114987227.cms,"Ajaz Patel (X Photo)

New Zealand's cricket team achieved a historic win against India, securing a 3-0 victory in their Test series. This marks the first time a visiting team has defeated India in a Test series played on Indian soil. Ajaz Patel , a key player in the New Zealand team, shared his thoughts on this victory, emphasizing the team's comprehensive preparation. He highlighted their focus on adapting to various playing conditions, a crucial aspect of their success.“We had a great winter back home where we prepared on turning wickets. We made sure we had different surfaces that we tried and practiced on, so we were, I guess, conditioned to bowling on different surfaces as well,” Patel told ICC.Patel explained that their rigorous training included practicing on different types of turning pitches, preparing them for the challenges of playing in India. This strategy proved effective as the team seamlessly adjusted to the varying conditions encountered during the series.Patel further elaborated on the distinct challenges posed by the pitches in Bangalore, Pune, and Mumbai, emphasizing the need for adaptability. He highlighted that adjusting to changing conditions is a significant challenge for teams touring the subcontinent.“It's been three different surfaces and three different games, and we’re well aware that one of the challenges of going to Asia is that the conditions are going to change all the time and you have to be adaptable and even within the game the conditions change very quickly.“I mean even in this Mumbai Test, I was bowling in the first innings and I felt like I was bowling really well, but the wicket wasn't really turning and then (when) I came back after Lunch, all of a sudden everything started happening.”The Mumbai Test held special significance for Patel, as it was at Wankhede Stadium that he achieved a remarkable feat in 2021.He became only the third bowler in Test cricket history to claim all 10 wickets in an innings, joining the ranks of Jim Laker and Anil Kumble . This accomplishment further solidified his reputation as a skilled spin bowler.Patel discussed the art of spin bowling, emphasizing the importance of versatility and adaptability. He stressed the need to quickly assess the playing surface and adjust one's bowling technique accordingly.“It's also reading the surface quickly because the conditions, as I say, do change at a constant (rate). Sometimes the conditions in the morning can be very different from the conditions in that middle session, and so as a spinner, it's about knowing how to get the most out of that. How to change your pace, how to go up and down while still having the ball shape,” said Patel.He explained that the ability to decipher the nuances of the pitch and adapt to changing conditions is crucial for spin bowlers to succeed.New Zealand's triumph in India followed a contrasting outcome in their previous series against Sri Lanka, where they experienced a complete reversal of fortune, losing all matches.Despite the contrasting results, Patel asserted that the team's overall performance remained consistent. He attributed the differing outcomes to factors like luck, especially the toss, which plays a crucial role in determining the course of a match, particularly in subcontinent conditions.“From Sri Lanka to here, I don't think we were too much different. I think we played some really good cricket in Sri Lanka, but unfortunately (lost the series). When you come to the subcontinent, the toss is so important and bowling in the last innings in comparison to bowling in the third innings, especially on a turning wicket, can sometimes be the difference as spinners,” Patel said.“While the results didn't go our way in Sri Lanka, I don't feel like we played too poorly or anything like that. Even from a batting department, we still put runs on the board. It was just a matter of, you know, having a bit of luck our way as well in the series,” Patel added.He acknowledged that while they faced setbacks in Sri Lanka, their overall performance was not drastically different. He emphasized that luck, particularly winning crucial tosses, can significantly influence the outcome of matches played on turning pitches, as is often the case in the subcontinent.","New Zealand's cricket team achieved a historic win against India, securing a 3-0 victory in their Test series.

On whether Spain are moving away from tiki-taka style

On Bagan's disqualification from ACL Two

have got 22 yellow cards in just 6 games so far in this ISL. Is discipline a worry for you so early in the season?

Jose Molina loves to live in the present. This is the byword for his life.The Mohun Bagan Super Giant coach's 'weltanschauung' or world philosophy may have been influenced by a personal battle to overcome cancer 22 years ago.Even a long-term contract is not something the 54-year-old Spaniard pines for. ""For me it's a piece of paper I need to sign. I'm here because Mohun Bagan wanted me and I wanted to come. But if any one of the parties is not happy, the best thing is to shake hands and leave,"" he said rather nonchalantly.His mind is now preoccupied with the catastrophic floods back in Spain. ""I live in the north of Valencia and floods have devastated the south. All my family and friends are okay. But it's a terrible catastrophe to have happened in Spain,"" he remarked, now with a serious, somber note.Molina - a former Spanish goalkeeper who's still regarded as a hero at Atletico Madrid - is not new to Indian football. By his own admission, since guiding now defunct ATK to the 2016 ISL title, he continued to be sounded out by several Indian clubs until he said yes to Bagan's call this year.During an exclusive chat with a select media persons, including TOI, at the Mohun Bagan tent on Tuesday, Molina opened up on several key chapters of his career, from playing with the likes of Diego Simeone and Lionel Scaloni to serving the Spanish football federation as its sporting director.I was a goalkeeper but made my debut for Spain as a left-winger! During the match against Norway (a friendly held in Oslo in 1996), the coach (Javier Clemente) used up all his substitutions and when another player got injured, I was given two options - either staying on the bench or coming on as a left-winger. I played for 16 minutes. (It was) not my position but an amazing experience.My last game (he played 9 matches in all for La Roja) was also against Norway (in Euro 2000). As a goalkeeper I made a mistake and we lost 1-0. The coach (José Antonio Camacho) said after the game that I would no longer play. As a player I had to accept the coach's decision. We all make mistakes and that decision still hurts me. Because I believe that I had the talent to play for Spain longer.I was also in the 1998 World Cup squad and (Andoni) Zubizarreta was No. 1 goalkeeper. We lost the first match 3-2 to Nigeria and Zubizarreta made mistakes. But the then coach (Clemente) decided that Zubizarreta stayed in the XI. That was not the case with me in 2000.Was it the best experience for me as a player? No. Every time I win any title that is the best experience. To win the ISL in 2016, the title in the Hong Kong league (with Kitchee). These are all parts of my best experiences.That was an amazing moment. Everyone at Real Madrid was preparing to celebrate the occasion by winning that match (Copa del Rey) since it was their centenary year and they were hosting the final at Estadio Santiago Bernabéu. It was more special because of my Atletico past. Day before the final, some of my friends at Atletico came over to me and wished me luck. People still talk about that match in La Coruna.When you are a player, you never know what will happen to you in future. Simeone and Scaloni - they too didn't know their future at that time. Even I wasn't sure about my future. I live in the present. Maybe my illness has helped me understand the value of enjoying my present as much as I can.One of the first things I did as a technical director (of Spanish football) was to look for more balance in our style and the kind of players suitable for this so that we could create a winning team. Football is a constant evolution. Spain has not changed tiki-taka style. But it's a process of evolution. Tiki-taka is still there, but sometimes you need to be more direct in your approach to the game.I am not happy with the AFC's decision. I would prefer my team to play in Asia. Now, you have to forget about the AFC and focus on ISL. We'll try to win it and play in the AFC next year to prove that an Indian team can be strong in Asia tournaments as well.Not at all. The yellow cards are the referee's decisions and they can be right or wrong. But Mohun Bagan have brought me here not to win the Fair play trophy but the title. If both are achieved, it's better, but the aim is always to win the championship.","Mohun Bagan coach Jose Molina is a former Spanish goalkeeper.

JFC suffer consecutive 5-goal hammering,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/jfc-suffer-consecutive-5-goal-hammering/articleshow/114964574.cms,"It proved to be another nightmare for Jamshedpur FC at JRD Tata Sports Complex on Monday as they were made to endure a 1-5 loss to Chennaiyin FC after their five-goal defeat in the last Indian Super League game.Jamshedpur's former Shield-winning coach Owen Coyle dealt a blow on Khalid Jamil's hosts with his new wards - with youngster Irfan Yadwad playing a lead role - as the visitors climbed two spots to sixth on the ISL table even as Jamshedpur held on to their fourth position after seven games with a number of seventh round fixtures still to go.The onslaught started as early as in the sixth minute when Pratik Chaudhary, in his bid to clear a Vinci Barretto cross from the left of the box, actually made a perfect finish into his own goal to the disappointment of his helpless goalkeeper Albino Gomes.Although Vishal Yumnam was a bit wide in putting in the ball in the 20th minute, Chennaiyin were gifted their second juts two minutes later. This time, it was the pace, skill and power of Yadwad as he vindicated the trust shown in him by veteran Coyle with a defence-splitting turn in the midfield that began the build-up to his first goal. The 23-year-old then made a run into the Jamshedpur box that could not be contained by the defenders led by Jamil's go-to man and captain Ashutosh Mehta as his shot at goal took a slight deflection en route the goal.There was no respite for Jamshedpur's weary defence, and Jamil at the stands, as two minutes later, in the 24th minute, Yadwad turned provider to Connor Shields - who had been missing his first goal of the season - with a pass outside the box that the Scottish shot into the right of the goal with Mehta at the other end.There was, however, no improvement in Jamshedpur's game as every trick in Khalid's book looked to have backfired in absence of defensive talisman Stepehn Eze, missing the match with a red card in the last game at NorthEast United.The script stayed the same after the change of ends as Chaudhary lost the ball a little outside the box to a Yadwad charge at him from the left in the 54th minute. It was Wilmar Jordan Gill who landed the pass from Yadwad and with only the goalkeeper to beat, made no mistake in adding the fifth to his goal tally this season.With both Jordan Murray and Javier Siverio having a bad day in office, and Jamil's 4-4-2 formation failing to stop the visitors' march, it was only a matter of time before Chennaiyin scored again and delivered a back-to-back five-goal assault on the Men of Steel. It was Lucas Brambilla's swerving solo effort from outside the box that left Gomes in another no position for a save.The hosts, with fans already leaving the Furnace, got a consolation goal after earning a controversial penalty kick from a Yadwad hand ball in the box - that was preceded by an offside call against Jamshedpur. Veteran Murray made no mistake to send in the spot kick but it was too little to ease the team and coach Jamil's disappointment after a great start to the season.",Jamshedpur lost 1-5 to Chennaiyin FC at JRD Tata Sports Complex on Monday.

Coco Gauff posted a rare victory over Iga Swiatek to punch her ticket to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals in Riyadh on Tuesday, ensuring Aryna Sabalenka will finish the year as the world number one Swiatek, the defending champion, was in a direct battle with Sabalenka for the top spot this week but needed a win over Gauff to keep her chances alive of leapfrogging her Belarusian rival.Gauff, 20, entered the contest having lost 11 of her 12 previous meetings with Swiatek, with the American's sole victory coming in Cincinnati last year.But she turned the tables on Swiatek on Tuesday, defeating the second seed 6-3, 6-4 to make it two straight-sets wins from two round-robin matches in Riyadh this week.""It feels great. I knew going into the match that despite our head-to-head I had a lot of confidence going in,"" said Gauff, who hit 11 double faults during the one-hour 48-minute showdown.With the exception of the opening game of the match, Gauff had break point opportunities in every Swiatek service game in the first set.The American third seed made her move in game seven, breaking for 4-3, and she closed out the set with a second break of serve, taking the lead in 49 minutes.Swiatek needed six break points in a marathon third game of the second set to finally take down the Gauff serve but she couldn't consolidate her advantage.They traded breaks again, as Gauff's double-fault tally went up to double digits and Swiatek racked up the errors.It was Gauff who eventually steadied the ship, and wrapped up the victory on Swiatek's 47th unforced error of the match.Swiatek, a five-time major champion, admits her two-month break between the US Open and the WTA Finals and the fact she is playing her first tournament with her new coach Wim Fissette have made things ""a bit more tricky and different than usual"".""But I'll force myself to work even better in the next match,"" the Pole added.Earlier in the day, Barbora Krejcikova ended Jessica Pegula's chances of qualifying for the semi-finals, defeating the sixth-seeded American 6-3, 6-3.A runner-up at the WTA Finals last year, Pegula suffered her second straight-sets defeat of the week and enters her final round-robin match against Swiatek on Thursday anchoring the Orange Group with zero sets won.Eighth-seeded Krejcikova bounced back from her opening loss to Swiatek to keep her hopes of making the final four alive.""I was fighting for every ball and I felt that I really have to play my best tennis and I was trying to be really solid and trying to put as many balls to the other side as I could,"" said Krejcikova, who picked up just her 20th match win of the season.""I'm definitely proud.

PARIS: Germany's Alexander Zverev won the Paris Masters on Sunday by defeating home hope Ugo Humbert 6-2, 6-2 in a dominant display by the new world number two.Zverev, 27, now boasts seven ATP 1000-level titles over the course of his career, following two wins in Rome and Madrid, as well as victories in Montreal and Cincinnati.It was a happy return to Paris for Zverev, after he lost the French Open final in five sets to Carlos Alcaraz in June. Four years ago he lost the 2020 Paris Masters championship match to Daniil Medvedev.His victory in Saturday's semi-final meant the current world number three will overtake Spain's Alcaraz in the new updated rankings.The German will next play the ATP Finals in Turin from November 10-17, where he will seek to emulate his past successes in 2018 and 2021 at the Tour's season-ending showpiece.And Zverev will head into the event as the player with the most wins this year as Sunday's victory in the French capital was his 66th in 2024, taking him one ahead of world number one Jannik Sinner.For 26-year-old Humbert it was a chastening experience at the end of a week that will live long in his memory as he reached his career-first Masters final on home soil.The world number 18 stunned four-time Grand Slam winner Alcaraz in the last 16 as he delighted the vocal home crowds on his way to becoming the first French finalist at the indoor event in 13 years.If Humbert had any nerves at the start of his first 1000-level title match, he did not show them as he held serve in the opening game with a sublime forehand passing shot at full stretch.But the sheer power of the German soon wore him down as Zverev forced a break point in the third game, which he converted as Humbert netted.A second consecutive break for Zverev handed him a 4-1 lead and with that the first set.Zverev was firmly in control of the match, making just four unforced errors to his opponent's 17 in the opener.And as if to compound this, Humbert started the second set with a double fault as Zverev immediately moved into a 1-0 lead.Zverev continued to grind his opponent down with his big serve and punishing groundstrokes, despite the efforts of the partisan crowd to boost Humbert.But the Frenchman could make no headway on the German's service games, winning only four points on return in the second set, and did not manage to hold one of his own until the fifth game.Zverev then served out to claim his second Masters trophy of the season, after victory on the clay of Rome in May.",Alexander Zverev beats Ugo Humbert in straight sets to win Paris Masters. The 27-year-old now boasts seven ATP 1000-level titles over the course of his career.

Pat Cummins-led Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) will take on Hardik Pandya 's Mumbai Indians in match no 41 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad on Wednesday.With only two wins in seven outings, Pat Cummins ’ side is under immense pressure to turn things around. Their campaign has been riddled with inconsistency, especially in the batting department which, despite boasting of explosive names, has flattered to deceive. The bowling unit too has lacked bite, and the combination of both has left SRH languishing in the bottom half of the table.On the other hand, the Mumbai Indians arrive in Hyderabad riding high on momentum. After a shaky start to the season, the five-time champions have bounced back emphatically with three consecutive wins, the latest being a dominant nine-wicket victory over Chennai Super Kings. Chasing 180 on a flat surface, MI romped home with more than four overs to spare — a statement win that underlined their return to form.The pitch at Hyderabad is likely to be a belter. There have been four scores of 240-plus this season in eight innings so far, so expect a lot of runs. Hyderabad as a ground has the highest strike-rate amongst batters and also the place where most sixes have been hit this season.Ryan Rickelton, Rohit Sharma, Will Jacks, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Naman Dhir, Mitchell Santner, Deepak Chahar, Trent Boult, Jasprit Bumrah, Karn SharmaVignesh PuthurTravis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen, Aniket Verma, Pat Cummins, Harshal Patel, Zeeshan Ansari, Mohammed Shami, Eshan Malinga, Abhinav ManoharWiaan Mulder241014It's going to be a warm evening after a hot day, where the max temperature is forecast to be 38° C in Hyderabad.The SRH vs MI match will be available on Star Sports network with livestreaming on JioHotstar.Pat Cummins (c), Ishan Kishan (wk), Atharva Taide, Abhinav Manohar, Aniket Verma, Sachin Baby, Smaran Ravichandran, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Travis Head, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Shami, Rahul Chahar, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan Ansari, Jaydev Unadkat, Eshan Malinga.Hardik Pandya (c), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Robin Minz, Ryan Rickelton (wk), Shrijith Krishnan (wk), Bevon Jacobs, Tilak Varma, Naman Dhir, Will Jacks, Mitchell Santner, Raj Angad Bawa, Vignesh Puthur, Corbin Bosch, Trent Boult, Karn Sharma, Deepak Chahar, Ashwani Kumar, Reece Topley, VS Penmetsa, Arjun Tendulkar, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Jasprit Bumrah.",Mumbai Indians take on Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.

Poll Who do you think was the standout player in the match between Delhi Capitals and Lucknow Super Giants? Axar Patel Mukesh Kumar Abishek Porel KL Rahul

Huge prediction! KL Rahul would play in place of Rishabh Pant in 2026 T20 World Cup

NEW DELHI: After a rollercoaster run in their last three IPL 2025 fixtures — a loss to Mumbai Indians, a nail-biting Super Over win against Rajasthan Royals, and a defeat to Gujarat Titans — Delhi Capitals finally found stability, cruising to a dominant eight-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow.The spotlight was firmly on KL Rahul , facing his former team for the first time, and the elegant right-hander delivered with trademark composure and class. Rahul played a match-winning knock, anchoring the chase with an unbeaten 57 off 42 balls, laced with four boundaries and three sixes. His fluent innings was a statement — not just against his former side, but also to those questioning his T20 credentials.Adding to the occasion, Rahul reached a monumental personal milestone — becoming the fastest Indian and the second-fastest overall to 5000 IPL runs, achieving the feat in just 130 innings. He surpassed the likes of Virat Kohli (157 innings), AB de Villiers (161), and Shikhar Dhawan (168), while trailing only David Warner, who took 135 innings.Rahul found a reliable partner in Abishek Porel, who stole the early show with a classy 51 off 36 balls. The pair shared a century stand that effectively took the game away from LSG. Porel’s positive intent and timing set the tone in the powerplay, while Rahul played the perfect anchor.Earlier, Mukesh Kumar’s brilliant spell set up the victory. The right-arm pacer wreaked havoc in the middle overs, scalping 4/34 in four overs, including the key wickets of Mitchell Marsh, Abdul Samad, Ayush Badoni, and Rishabh Pant . His strikes derailed LSG’s charge just as they looked to push past 180.Despite a solid foundation laid by Aiden Markram (52 off 33) and Mitchell Marsh (45 off 36), LSG stuttered in the death overs to end on 159/6. Axar Patel and Mitchell Starc supported Mukesh with tight spells, while Kuldeep Yadav chipped in with one wicket.Chasing 160, DC lost Karun Nair early, but the Rahul-Porel partnership took control, and Axar Patel’s unbeaten 34 off 20 applied the finishing touches. Rahul fittingly sealed the win with a towering six over mid-wicket off Prince Yadav.With this win, Delhi Capitals solidified their second spot on the points table with 12 points from 8 matches — six wins and just two losses.","Delhi Capitals cruise to eight-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants.

Gujarat Titans bolstered their chances of qualifying for the IPL 2025 playoffs following their convincing 39-run win against Kolkata Knight Riders at the Eden Gardens on Monday night. The win maintained GT's foothold at the top of the IPL points table with 12 points from eight matches - winning six and losing two.Delhi Capitals, Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Punjab Kings occupy the remain three playoff spots.KKR, meanwhile, remain seventh as they picked up their second straight loss in the season. They are on six points after eight matches - winning three and losing five. They are still in contention for playoffs but will have to pull up their socks if they are to go through without a hiccup considering the table is tight above them with four teams on 10 points and Mumbai Indians on eight points.Captain Ajinkya Rahane emerged as KKR's primary fight, scoring a determined 50 off 36 balls with five boundaries and a six as they chased 199 runs. His innings concluded when Washington Sundar had him stumped in the 13th over.The middle order's collapse followed quickly as Venkatesh Iyer and Rahane followed in quick succession followed by the same episode with the wickets of Andre Russell and Ramandeep Singh.Prasidh Krishna delivered a double strike in the 17th over, removing both Ramandeep Singh and Moeen Ali, further diminishing KKR's chances of victory.In the first innings, GT skipper Shubman Gill led the scoring with a brilliant 90 runs off 55 balls, helping GT set a challenging total of 198/3 in 20 overs.On a slow surface, GT struggled initially, managing only 45 runs in the powerplay, but they accelerated their scoring afterward. Gill and B Sai Sudharsan, who scored 52, formed a formidable opening partnership of 114 runs.Jos Buttler added a quick 41 not out from just 23 deliveries, capitalising on some fielding mistakes by KKR. However, it raised questions about GT's risk management, as they could only muster 59 runs in the last five overs.","Gujarat Titans remain top of the IPL 2025 points table following their win against Kolkata Knight Riders at the Eden Gardens on April 21.

NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma publicly thanked his long-time friend and personal mentor Abhishek Nayar on Monday, days after the BCCI terminated Nayar’s tenure as the national team's assistant coach.Also visit: KKR vs GT, IPL Live Score In a heartfelt Instagram post following his unbeaten 76-run knock for Mumbai Indians in the IPL , Rohit shared a photo celebrating his return to form and tagged Nayar with a simple yet powerful message: ""Thanks bro @ABHISHEKNAYAR.""Rohit and Nayar go back a long way, having played together for Mumbai in domestic cricket. In recent years, whenever Rohit returns home, Nayar has quietly taken on the role of his personal coach, helping the India skipper refine his game through one-on-one sessions.Nayar's influence extends well beyond Rohit. KL Rahul , after a match-winning knock for Delhi Capitals, had recently acknowledged Nayar's support, stating, ""Big shoutout to Abhishek Nayar. I've worked a lot with him ever since he came into the Indian team.""Despite his sacking — alongside fielding coach T Dilip and strength and conditioning coach Soham Desai — Nayar has swiftly returned to the IPL circuit. He has rejoined the Kolkata Knight Riders setup, a franchise he previously helped to the IPL title in 2024. Though KKR has yet to officially announce his designation, his quiet but impactful return could once again prove decisive.","Rohit Sharma thanks Abhishek Nayar on Instagram for his support.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

The competition for a spot in the IPL 2025 playoffs is heating up massively, with teams looking to pull off dominant wins in order to boost their NRR. Gujarat Titans (GT) are currently on top of the table with 12 points in eight matches and a NRR of +1.104. Delhi Capitals (DC), Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Punjab Kings (PBKS) occupy the second, third and fourth positions. DC have accumulated 10 points in seven matches at a NRR of +0.589. RCB and PBKS currently have the same number of points as the Axar-Patel-led side. However, their NRR stands at +0.472 and +0.177, respectively.Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), Rajasthan Royals (RR), SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) occupy the last four spots on the points table. KKR are the best placed with six points while the other franchises have won only four points so far. However, every side currently has a chance of making it to the IPL playoffs. Here's a look at what the teams need to do to qualify for the playoffs:Winning two out of their remaining six matches should prove enough, considering they have the best NRR currently. Sai Sudharshan and Prasidh Krishna are the current Orange and Purple cap holders showcasing their dominance across all departments. The Gujarat-based franchise have bounced back incredibly this season following an underwhelming performance last year. GT face RR, SRH, MI, DC, LSG and CSK in their remaining matches.The Axar Patel-led side will need to win three out of their remaining seven matches, having played one game fewer than GT. DC's NRR is the second-best in the league which will definitely play a crucial role with regard to sealing a spot in the playoffs. DC face LSG, RCB, KKR, SRH, PBKS, GT and MI in their remaining matches.The Rajat Patidar-led side has accumulated 10 points in eight matches, making three wins in the remaining six matches sufficient with regard to securing a spot in the playoffs. RR, DC, CSK, LSG, SRH and KKR are the teams they will be facing in their remaining games.Both teams will look to win three out of their last six matches in order to stay in contention for the playoffs. However, they have an inferior NRR in comparison to RCB's +0.472. While PBKS have a NRR of +0.177, LSG's NRR stands at +0.088 with 10 points in hand. Dominant wins will hold both teams in good stead, considering the immense competition. PBKS face CSK, LSG, DC, MI and RR in their remaining matches. DC, MI, PBKS, RCB, GT and SRH will be LSG's opponents.The Hardik Pandya-led side will need to win four of the remaining six matches. MI currently have eight points as well as a NRR of +0.483. They will face SRH, LSG, RR, GT, PBKS and DC in their upcoming encounters.The defending champions are in a tough position following their defeat by 39 runs against GT. The Ajinkya Rahane-led side will need to win five out of their remaining six matches to remain in contention for a playoff berth. KKR are set to face PBKS, DC, RR, CSK, SRH and RCB.CSK and RR need to win their remaining six matches while SRH require six wins in their remaining seven games. The poor NRR of these teams could well prove to be a stumbling block. RR will face RCB, GT, MI, KKR, CSK and PBKS in their last six matches. CSK's upcoming matches will be against SRH, PBKS, RCB, KKR, RR and GT.

Rishabh Pant-led Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) will lock horns against Axar Patel 's Delhi Capitals (DC) in match No 40 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow.With five wins in seven games, DC are placed at the second place on the points table, whereas LSG are at fifth position with 10 points in eight games.For Lucknow the poor form of their captain Rishabh Pant is a big worry. He has merely 106 runs from eight games and 63 of those came in a single match. His strike-rate of 98 is also a tad worrisome.On the other hand, Axar too will have some concerns about their skipper -- Axar Patel. Axar has led well and made 140 runs at a strike-rate of 159, but those improvements have masked his diminishing returns as a bowler -- just a solitary wicket from seven matches at an economy of 9.36.This season, LSG have played four matches at home, two each on black and red soil surfaces, respectively. The black soil pitches have favoured the team’s strengths and brought two victories, while the team has lost both matches played on the red soil pitch, which will be used for Tuesday’s game. Rishabh Pant and Co. will be keeping their fingers crossed heading into this one.LSG predicted XI: Aiden Markram, Mitchell Marsh, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh Pant (c & wk), Ayush Badoni, David Miller, Abdul Samad, Shardul Thakur, Avesh Khan, Ravi Bishnoi, Prince YadavDigvesh RathiAbhishek Porel, KL Rahul (wk), Karun Nair, Axar Patel (c), Tristan Stubbs, Ashutosh Sharma, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Mukesh KumarDonovan FerreiraAccuWeather forecasts a temperature drop from 36°C at the start of the match to 29°C by the end, with no rain expected.Catch the match between LSG vs DC on the Star Sports Network on TV, with livestreaming available on JioHotstar from 7:30 PM IST onwards.Rishabh Pant (wk/captain), Aiden Markram, Mitchell Marsh, Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, Abdul Samad, David Miller, Shardul Thakur, Avesh Khan, Akash Deep, Digvesh Singh Rathi, Ravi Bishnoi, Prince Yadav, Shahbaz Ahmed, Matthew Breetzke, Himmat Singh, Shamar Joseph, Manimaran Siddharth, Aryan Juyal, RS Hangargekar, Yuvraj Chaudhary, Akash Maharaj Singh, Mayank Yadav, Arshin Kulkarni.Axar Patel (c), Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, Karun Nair, KL Rahul(w), Tristan Stubbs, Ashutosh Sharma, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Mukesh Kumar, Sameer Rizvi, Darshan Nalkande, Donovan Ferreira, Tripurana Vijay, Dushmantha Chameera, Faf du Plessis, T Natarajan, Ajay Jadav Mandal, Manvanth Kumar L, Madhav Tiwari.","Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) take on Delhi Capitals (DC) in match No 40 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

The writing on the wall seems to getting clearer for defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders . The Knights are precariously placed, having won just three games out of eight. They face an uphill task to make the playoffs from here.Just a fortnight ago, KKR’s highest-paid player Venkatesh Iyer , explaining the team’s gameplan, had said, “We want to be a team which understands the pitch and conditions quickly, to assess the par score and try to make 20 runs above par. That’s what aggression means for KKR.” It hasn’t exactly worked out that way.Things changed quickly thereafter and former KKR skipper captain Eoin Morgan hit the nail on the head when he said after Monday’s loss to Gujarat Titans, “They (KKR) had the same failures they’ve shown throughout the tournament.” The problem is there for all to see, as skipper Ajinkya Rahane and mentor Dwayne Bravo both admitted.“We bowled really well, we faltered with our batting,” Rahane said after the side’s 39-run loss to GT at home. “I think the bowlers, first of all, did a fantastic job restricting them to under 200,” Bravo said. “When you are chasing 199, you expect a good start, That’s what we’re struggling (with) throughout this tournament.”KKR’s winning template last season was based on the blistering starts provided by Sunil Narine and Phil Salt. They’ve tried replicating that impact with three different opening partnerships this season, but with little success. No wonder their openers have the worst batting average this season (19) so far.“IPL is a tough tournament, and when you don’t start well, batsmen go into a period where they lose confidence,” Bravo said. “Form brings confidence. And we, at the moment, to be honest, don’t have that confidence,” a candid Bravo explained.Although doubts were raised about the forms of KKR’s retained trio Rinku Singh , Andre Russell and Ramandeep Singh, Bravo felt slowing down in the middle overs is leaving too much for the finishers to achieve. “Russell is not the only one who is struggling at the moment.When Russell walks in to bat every time, the run-rate is at 14-15. So the work needs to be done on top so that we give him a chance to finish off games like he is accustomed to doing over the years for KKR,” Bravo stated.The team also does not seem to arrive at a settled batting order, with impact player Angkrish Raghuvanshi, one of their in-form batters, coming at No. 9. “We tried to create a left-right combination,” Bravo said trying to explain the batting order.But at the same time he indicated some changes in the coming days. “There is a fine line between backing a player and trying to come up with the best combination. We can try to make some changes, some necessary adjustments to give the team the spark that is missing,” the West Indian saidAlso Watch:",Defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders have won just three games out of eight.

Hyderabad: When SRH host MI on Wednesday, local lad Tilak Varma will garner much attention despite being in the opposition camp. The 22-year-old lefthander considers playing at home a “special moment”.“It’s an emotional moment to play at the home ground. It is a special moment for me,” Varma said here on Tuesday. He is, naturally, pleased that Mumbai Indians are on a roll. “It’s not easy to win three games (in a row), but I would say it’s a long tournament, so we just want to follow our basics and be calm.We want to do the right thing at the right moment. Though we lost four games in the first five matches, the team atmosphere is good and there is belief that we can do better now.” Speaking about the Uppal pitch, he said, “The Hyderabad wicket is always good to bat on, so we’re hoping that it will be a big scoring game again.There are two wickets — one is flat, the one that was used in the last game, and the second wicket is slightly tricky. It takes a little time to get going. We’re ready for both.”Sunrisers Hyderabad ’s assistant coach Simon Helmot said that they are raring to go against Mumbai Indians. “We are a very positive team. We have lots of self-belief. Yes, we’d like the win-loss ratio to be slightly different, but the camp is in a very positive frame of mind.”","Tilak Varma says playing at home is a'special moment' for him.

They have raised expectations only to falter. The fine run that culminated in a runners-up finish last season was rooted in home domination — the Sunrisers had won five of their seven matches at home, losing only one, while a match against Gujarat was abandoned.This season, SRH have won two and lost two at home and also lost all three away games so far. The team seems to be struggling on many fronts, from the indifferent form Travis Head to their inability to cope with slow surfaces.If inspiration is what they need to better their standing of 14 defeats in 24 encounters against MI, SRH need to look no further than their rivals, who have improved their position with three straight wins.

Huge prediction! KL Rahul would play in place of Rishabh Pant in 2026 T20 World Cup

NEW DELHI: Opener Abishek Porel and KL Rahul struck confident half-centuries and shared a 69-run partnership as Delhi Capitals thrashed Lucknow Super Giants by eight wickets in an Indian Premier League match on Tuesday. Chasing 160 for victory, Porel scored a fluent 51 off 36 balls, while the in-form Rahul remained unbeaten on 57 off 42 deliveries, guiding DC to a comfortable win in 17.5 overs. Skipper Axar Patel added the finishing touches with an unbeaten 34 off just 20 balls. Rahul also reached the 5,000-run milestone in IPL, becoming the fastest Indian to do so.With this win, Delhi Capitals remained second place on the points table with 12 points from 8 matches, having won six and lost two.

Huge prediction! KL Rahul would play in place of Rishabh Pant in 2026 T20 World Cup

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

Poll How confident are you about India's chances of winning the 2026 T20 World Cup? Not confident at all Not very confident Somewhat confident Very confident

NEW DELHI: Astrologer Greenstone Lobo has made a bold prediction, suggesting that KL Rahul will replace Rishabh Pant in India's squad for the 2026 T20 World Cup . Lobo also highlighted young players who could step in for the retired Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, strengthening India’s future lineup.The 2026 T20 World Cup, scheduled to take place from February to March 2026, will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.India, the defending champions after their victory over South Africa in the previous edition, are expected to field a rejuvenated squad, with new talent ready to shine on the world stage.""I'm going to talk about some future superstars who could break into the Indian cricket squad — players who are currently showcasing their skills in the IPL. We'll start with the top order, move into the middle order, and then discuss the bowlers. I’ll be looking at potential replacements for the T20 World Cup,"" Lobo told TimesofIndia.com.""Let’s begin with two iconic players — Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli — who have now retired. So, who are the potential candidates in the current Indian setup? One name that stands out to me is Abhishek Sharma. He was part of the squad earlier but couldn’t get a chance to play for the country in the T20 World Cup. He definitely looks like a very important replacement. Born in the year 2000, he has a phenomenal horoscope. He’s what I call a ""Grey Lizard."" Grey Lizards are players born between 1999 and 2001 who have Pluto positioned between 8 and 14 degrees in their charts. These individuals tend to be extremely destructive on the field — and Abhishek is certainly one of them.""Now, who will partner him? Another Grey Lizard — Shubman Gill. Shubman Gill also has a fabulous horoscope. I believe these two Grey Lizards at the top of the order can be a very destructive opening pair.""Now, the man who I believe could make a comeback into the T20 World Cup team is KL Rahul. He's been part of many squads before but hasn’t yet been part of a title-winning team. Of course, he recently won the Champions Trophy, but he often gave up his spot to others — one of them being Rishabh Pant. Pant hasn’t been performing well lately, and I’ve always championed KL Rahul. I’ve said this in my book Howzat: 50 Predictions on Indian Cricket, even back in 2019 — around the time of the infamous coffee controversy. Even when people said he didn’t have the game for T20s, I maintained he’d make a strong comeback. And he has. He’s silenced his critics, and I believe he’ll definitely be in the squad — possibly even replacing Rishabh Pant.""Then there's Suryakumar Yadav — he’s the captain and is obviously going to be part of the team. And what a journey it has been for Axar Patel. From being just a bowler to becoming a reliable all-rounder and now a captain — he's grown from strength to strength and will undoubtedly be a part of the squad. See, the entire crux of the team — the entire core — looks very, very powerful because a lot of players were born between 1992 and 1994. These years are significant because Pluto was very close to 0 degrees, and Neptune was very close to 25 degrees. Now, these are the deepest exaltation points, and since Neptune and Pluto are the topmost planets, when they reach their deepest exaltation, they create legends.""So we’re looking at a list of legends here. For instance, Axar Patel — I’d include him. KL Rahul is definitely there. I’d also include another name — Shreyas Iyer. Shreyas Iyer, in fact, could potentially replace Shivam Dube. Shivam Dube, born in 1993, has done very well for the country. But Shreyas Iyer, born in 1994, has not only Pluto and Neptune in deep exaltation, but also Chiron — another very powerful planet — in a strong position. He has been showing his mettle, not just as a player but also as a captain. And all those critics who spoke about his issues with the short ball — well, in the Asia Cup, he shut them all up. So, he's definitely a very strong contender for the middle order. And of course, there's Hardik Pandya — another 1993-born — he picks himself, no questions there.""One interesting name I want to mention is Vipraj Nigam. Now, I don't know if he’ll be an immediate replacement, but he can definitely be a long-term one for Ravindra Jadeja. Born in 2004, Vipraj has a phenomenal horoscope, with Pluto at 25 degrees — that’s powerful. And he’s as good an all-rounder as Jadeja, which is quite interesting. Then there’s Kuldeep Yadav. If you're looking for a solid spinner, he’s your man. Born in 1994 — again, just look at how many key players we have from 1992, 1993, and 1994. Phenomenal. This Indian team is looking very, very polished and strong for the next World Cup.""As for Arshdeep Singh — yes, he’s in the mix — but I’d say Mayank Yadav isn’t a replacement; they’re both young and can play together. If you want to really stun the opposition with sheer pace, Mayank is your guy.""Mayank Yadav has a very good horoscope. Born in 2001, he was born when Uranus had just entered deep exaltation. And Uranus is the planet of sudden impact — it brings magic, surprise, and power. Mayank has it in him to jolt the opposition. But of course, fitness is key — he must maintain that. And finally, Jasprit Bumrah. Born in 1993 — again, just look at this team! So many born in that golden period. Bumrah has already played one ICC trophy and missed another. That’s okay — we don’t need him to play every ICC event. What we need is a fully fit Bumrah for the next 50-over World Cup. Even if he skips some matches or series, that’s fine. Because he has the horoscope to win both the T20 and the ODI World Cups. Jasprit Bumrah is definitely going to be there.""Now, looking at long-term replacements for the team — I’d throw in two names.

CHENNAI: After a nightmarish Indian Super League campaign, where they did not even come close to qualifying for the playoffs, Chennaiyin FC will be eager to salvage some pride in the Super Cup in Bhubaneswar. Chennaiyin will begin their run with a challenging round-of-16 fixture against ISL big gun Mumbai City FC on Wednesday.The knockout tournament offers CFC another opportunity to end a long wait – while Chennaiyin have not won silverware since their 2017-18 ISL triumph, they have not been at the continental level since the 2018-19 season. For CFC to pose a threat, they will have to stay “consistent”, a quality that head coach Owen Coyle believes they lacked in the ISL.“When we are at our best, we can stand toe-to-toe with the best teams. The cup competition is a great opportunity for everybody, because there is an AFC spot up for grabs. There is an incentive for everyone to go and win the cup,” Coyle said.“We started the ISL season well and finished strongly. We had a poor middle section of the season. For sure, there is added motivation to finish the season on a high. We were very inconsistent in the ISL; that is what cost us a place in the top-six. We have to get back to giving good performances consistently,” added Coyle.Chennaiyin should show drastic improvement in the defensive department, after keeping only four clean sheets in the league stage of the ISL. The luxury to use both Ryan Edwards and Elsinho at the heart of defence at the same time – a club can field a maximum of six foreigners – could solve some issues for the chief coach.Coyle acknowledged that there is a huge scope for improvement in defence but stressed that the team would not get into a shell for the sake of a clean sheet. “That (poor defending) was the biggest thing that hurt us in the ISL; we did not defend well enough. But in cup competitions, you have to win games. We will certainly not be seeing a more defensive approach; we will see a team going out to win games,” said Coyle.What should give CFC a bit of hope for Wednesday’s game is the fact that Mumbai could miss a few key players due to different reasons (injuries, rehabilitation and personal situation). While Jon Toral and Jayesh Rane have been ruled out of the tournament, Yoell van Nieff, Jeremy Manzorro and Prabir Das are doubtful starters for the clash on Wednesday.Asked if CFC will have the upper hand, Coyle replied: “We are under no illusion; Mumbai are a wonderful side. Van Nieff and Manzorro could probably make it to the game. They have many good Indian players like Lallianzuala Chhangte, Vikram Pratap Singh and Mehtab Singh who add to the mix.”",Chennaiyin FC face Mumbai City FC in the Indian Super League (ISL) Super Cup.

Liverpool are on the verge of securing their second Premier League title, needing just three points from their remaining five matches to become champions. Arsenal's victory over Ipswich Town has pushed the earliest possible title confirmation date to Wednesday (April 23), when Arsenal face Crystal Palace.Liverpool currently sit at the top of the Premier League table with 79 points after 33 games played, holding a commanding 13-point lead over second-placed Arsenal, who have 66 points.The Reds require only three points from their available 15 to mathematically secure their 20th overall league title. Even if Arsenal win all their remaining matches, they can only reach 81 points, while Liverpool would have 82 points with just one more victory.The title race could be decided as early as Wednesday if Arsenal lose to Crystal Palace at home. In this scenario, Arsenal would remain on 66 points with only 12 points left to play for, making it mathematically impossible to catch Liverpool.Should Arsenal defeat Crystal Palace, Liverpool could still clinch the title on Sunday (April 27), with a victory over Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield. This would put Arne Slot's team 13 points ahead with only four matches remaining.The current Premier League standings show Liverpool in first place with 79 points and a goal difference of +44, while Arsenal occupy second position with 66 points and a +34 goal difference. Third place follows with 60 points and a +14 goal difference.Arsenal's win at Ipswich Town on Sunday eliminated the possibility of Liverpool securing the title that day, shifting the focus to the upcoming midweek fixtures as the next potential title-deciding moment.The title race has now entered its final phase with just five weekends of action remaining in the 2024/25 Premier League season. Both teams have challenging fixtures ahead as they navigate through the closing stages of the campaign.This upcoming period will determine whether Liverpool can maintain their substantial lead and secure their second Premier League title, or if Arsenal can mount an unlikely late challenge in the remaining matches.","Liverpool currently sit at the top of the Premier League table with 79 points after 33 games played.

Trent Alexander-Arnold fired Liverpool to the brink of the Premier League title as his late strike sealed a 1-0 win that relegated Leicester after Arsenal's 4-0 rout of Ipswich delayed the leaders' coronation on Sunday.Arne Slot's side could have clinched a record-equalling 20th English title with a combination of an Arsenal loss and a victory at the King Power Stadium.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Liverpool fulfilled their half of the equation, but second-placed Arsenal were not so obliging earlier in the afternoon.The Gunners' stroll at Portman Road meant Liverpool kicked off still needing six points from their last six games to seal a first title since 2020.Thanks to Alexander-Arnold's match-winning contribution after coming off the bench, Liverpool are 13 points clear of Arsenal with five games left for both teams.The Reds will seal the title if Arsenal lose at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday or if they beat Tottenham at Anfield on April 27.It looked like being a frustrating day for Liverpool as second-bottom Leicester kept them at bay despite a host of chances for the visitors.Slot's men finally made the breakthrough in the 76th minute when Alexander-Arnold lashed home the rebound from close-range after Mohamed Salah and Diogo Jota both hit the crossbar.With speculation mounting that Alexander-Arnold will join Real Madrid when his contract expires at the end of the season, it was notable that the England right-back embarked on a wild celebration of his winner.Alexander-Arnold earned a booking for ripping off his shirt and planting it on the corner flag after he sprinted to 3,000 jubilant Liverpool fans in one corner of the King Power.""It took us a long time and, of course, a great moment for Trent after working so hard to come back. To score the goal that makes a lot of difference is very special,"" Slot said.""It's never hard to dream (of the title) but you see we are really focused on playing Tottenham.""Liverpool's title celebration is only a matter of time but Leicester will spend next season in the Championship after their woeful one-year stay in the top tier came to an end with a 23rd defeat in 33 league games.Fresh from a famous victory over Real Madrid on Wednesday to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time since 2009, Arsenal ensured Liverpool would not be able to start their party this weekend.Mikel Arteta made only three changes from the 2-1 win in the Spanish capital and was rewarded with a dominant display to kill the game off inside half an hour.""All we can do is delay that moment (Liverpool win the league) from our side to earn the right to finish as high as possible,"" Arteta said.Leandro Trossard was one of those recalled by Arteta and prodded in his eighth goal of the season to open the scoring.A flowing move saw Bukayo Saka's cross flicked by Mikel Merino into the path of Gabriel Martinelli to finish to double the Gunners lead.Moments later, Saka was chopped down by an awful challenge from Leif Davis that saw the Ipswich left-back shown a straight red card.Trossard fired in his second after a well-worked corner before Ethan Nwaneri's deflected effort rounded off the scoring.Defeat realistically ends third-bottom Ipswich's hope of maintaining their Premier League status as they are 15 points adrift of safety with five games remaining and have a significantly poorer goal difference than West Ham.Chelsea needed two late goals at Fulham to revive their chances of Champions League football next season with a dramatic 2-1 victory.Alex Iwobi opened the scoring on 20 minutes and Chelsea were meandering towards a damaging defeat until 19-year-old substitute Tyrique George fired in a snap shot from the edge of the box on 83 minutes.Pedro Neto then completed the comeback with a stunning strike in stoppage-time to secure Chelsea's sixth win in their last 17 league games.Fifth-placed Chelsea moved above Nottingham Forest, who travel to Tottenham on Monday.

Barcelona staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Celta Vigo 4-3 at home on Saturday, extending their La Liga lead to seven points over Real Madrid. After trailing 3-1 with less than 30 minutes remaining, Barcelona's Dani Olmo and Raphinha , who scored twice including a 98th-minute penalty, secured the crucial victory.Barcelona took an early lead through Ferran Torres in the 12th minute, who scored from the edge of the box after finding space in Celta's defence.Celta Vigo responded quickly, with Borja Iglesias equalising three minutes later. Pablo Duran's cross found Iglesias, who scored into an empty net after goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny failed to intercept.Barcelona's attempts to regain the lead saw Raphinha sending a free-kick over the bar and Robert Lewandowski missing the target. Szczesny made important saves from Ilaix Moriba and Iker Losada at the other end.Iglesias put Celta ahead early in the second half, capitalizing on Frenkie de Jong's error to score past Szczesny. He later completed his hat-trick after being set up by Sergio Carreira, taking advantage of Barcelona's high defensive line.""This is football, we really wanted to win, maybe we weren't at our best but the response from the team, and the fans pushed us on... we deserved it,"" Olmo told DAZN. ""These are three points that take us closer to our objective, they're important and we have to continue.""Barcelona coach Hansi Flick had initially rested 17-year-old Lamine Yamal for the first time in 2025 but brought him on after Iglesias' third goal.The comeback began when Raphinha assisted Olmo, who beat goalkeeper Vicente Guaita. Raphinha then scored himself, heading in Yamal's cross from the right.Celta missed a chance to secure the win when Oscar Mingueza headed wide from close range in the 90th minute.The decisive moment came in the 96th minute when VAR review led to a penalty after Yoel Lago fouled Olmo. With Lewandowski substituted, Raphinha converted the spot-kick into the top-right corner.""It's a bittersweet feeling... we scored three, which few teams can do here, but it feels bad,"" said Celta's Duran. ""We have to be proud of our team, we came here with personality, played well, had a good plan and carried it out -- but for small details it got away from us.""The victory maintains Barcelona's strong position in the title race, with Real Madrid set to face Athletic Bilbao on Sunday and a Clasico matchup scheduled for May.Celta Vigo, currently seventh in La Liga and competing for European qualification, showed attacking prowess throughout the match despite the eventual defeat.","Barcelona come from behind to defeat Celta Vigo 4-3 in La Liga.

""After the 4-3, the penalty from Bruno, you feel that you can change the game.""The Red Devils sit 14th in the English top flight and defeat would have almost certainly meant missing out on European football entirely next season.Instead they are just three games away from a European trophy and the lifeline of direct access to the riches of the Champions League next season.""Everybody in this moment believes it is possible,"" added Amorim.""One moment can change a lot of things in the players' minds.""United's history is built on dramatic late fightbacks, but few have been more remarkable than this to leave Lyon shellshocked.The home side got off to a flying start thanks to a fine team goal as Fernandes released Alejandro Garnacho down the right and his cross picked out Ugarte to slot in just his second goal since joining the English giants from Paris Saint-Germain.Amorim's decision to restore Andre Onana in goal was under scrutiny.The Cameroonian had been dropped for Sunday's 4-1 thrashing at Newcastle after two costly errors that led to both Lyon's goals in last week's 2-2 first leg draw.Those mistakes came after a war of words with former United midfielder Nemanja Matic, who labelled him ""one of the worst goalkeepers in United's history"".The 29-year-old rewarded his manager's faith with a couple of important stops to prevent Lyon levelling through Paul Akouokou and Rayan Cherki.At the other end, a United side that have often looked laboured and lacking in ideas all season, suddenly clicked into gear in the first 45 minutes.United doubled their lead in first-half stoppage time when Maguire's long ball was expertly controlled by Diogo Dalot, who then fired in off the inside of the post.Garnacho should have killed the tie off within minutes of the restart for the second half when he shot straight at Lucas Perri with Fernandes begging for a pass for a tap in.But the defensive deficiencies and mental fragility of Amorim's side were exposed in a collapse that threatened to cap a miserable campaign.Alexandre Lacazette flicked on Moussa Niakhate's header and Corentin Tolisso swooped to head in and give the visitors a lifeline.Nicolas Tagliafico then prodded in at the back post despite Onana's attempt to scoop it off the line.Just as Lyon were in the ascendency Tolisso gave them a mountain to climb again with a soft second yellow for a trip on Casemiro.Yet, it did not initially matter as Cherki confirmed his status as one of Europe's rising stars with a powerful drive that left Onana motionless.Lyon's other prized asset, Malick Fofana, was then chopped down by Luke Shaw inside the area and Lacazette confidently dispatched the resulting spot-kick.Another penalty at the other end, though, kickstarted the fightback as Fernandes fired home after a VAR review for a foul on Casemiro.Substitute Mainoo showed why he had been thrust in an unfamiliar forward role with a composed finish to level on 120 minutes.Barely 60 seconds later Maguire completed the comeback with a towering header at the back post.""In this moment it is difficult to believe what has just happened,"" said Lyon coach Paulo Fonseca.It is the first time ever in European competition that five goals have been scored in extra-time.",Manchester United came from 4-2 down in extra-time to beat Lyon 5-4 in a remarkable Europa League quarter-final to progress 7-6 on aggregate.

NEW DELHI: Arsenal secured a historic 2-1 victory against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday, advancing to the Champions League semifinals for the first time since 2009 with a 5-1 aggregate score.The match featured crucial VAR interventions in two penalty decisions, with Arsenal maintaining their impressive first-leg advantage of 3-0 from London.Arsenal will now face Paris Saint-Germain in the semifinals, while Inter Milan, who defeated Bayern Munich, will meet Barcelona in the other semifinal matchup.Real Madrid, the defending champion and 15-time European winner, failed to produce one of their trademark comebacks at the Bernabeu, falling short of the last four for the first time since 2020.""There was a lot of talk coming here about (Real Madrid) coming back, because they've done it so many times before, but we had so much belief and confidence from that first game to come here and win the game,"" said Arsenal's Declan Rice, who had scored twice in the first leg through free kicks. ""We knew we were going to suffer, but we knew we were going to win. We had it in our minds and now we've done it in real life.""The match's momentum shifted early when VAR overturned a penalty for Real Madrid following a hold on Kylian Mbappé, after a five-minute review with the score at 0-0.Arsenal had earlier missed their own VAR-awarded penalty when Bukayo Saka failed to convert from the spot.Saka later redeemed himself by scoring in the 65th minute after receiving a pass from Mikel Merino, though Madrid quickly equalized through Vinícius Júnior following a defensive error by William Saliba.Gabriel Martinelli sealed Arsenal's victory with a stoppage-time goal, assisted by Merino.""This is one of the best nights in my football career, for sure,"" Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta said. ""It's a really special one against a team that has been an inspiration for a lot of us in this competition. To win this tie in the manner that we have, we can be very proud.""Mbappé's substitution in the 75th minute due to an apparent injury drew jeers from some Bernabeu supporters, marking another disappointing Champions League campaign for the French star.""It's a tough moment,"" Madrid's Lucas Vazquez said. ""We tried but in the end we couldn't achieve our goal. We'll come back stronger. Madrid always does.""Real Madrid's task was challenging from the outset, facing an Arsenal team that hadn't lost by a three-goal margin in nearly three years. Only four teams in Champions League history had overcome a three-goal first-leg deficit at home.The match began with early drama as Madrid had a goal disallowed after two minutes when Mbappé was caught offside.Arsenal maintained their unbeaten record against Real Madrid, extending it to four matches, including their previous Champions League knockout stage victory in 2005-06.The game featured significant VAR involvement, with Arsenal's penalty awarded after review showed Raúl Asencio holding Mikel Merino during a corner kick.Another VAR review led to the reversal of Madrid's penalty claim after initially being awarded for a hold on Mbappé by Rice.The victory marks Arsenal's return to the Champions League semifinals after a 15-year absence, with their last appearance ending in elimination by Manchester United in 2008-09.",Arsenal defeat Real Madrid 2-1 in Champions League quarterfinals.

Formula E driver Norman Nato is back from Italy after participating in the World Endurance Championship . He took part in the 6 Hours of Imola race, where he finished in tenth position while driving for Hertz Team Jota . After the Sunday race, he penned a note reflecting on his experience in Imola. He also shared a series of candid pictures from the track, including some behind-the-scenes moments — one of which resembled a recent post by F1 driver Alex Albon.Taking to Instagram, Norman Nato posted a few pictures from Italy and wrote a caption summarizing his experience at the 6 Hours of Imola. He wrote: “Difficult weekend in Imola with P10 in race. Still early process with our new team, we keep learning. As always after a difficult one, we gonna analyse and make progress to come back stronger for the next one in Spa @cadillacvseries @jota_sport.”Encouraging him, Cadillac’s official Instagram page commented: “Building and growing,” along with clapping emojis. A person he apparently met in Imola responded to the post: “What a weekend, still enjoyed it a lot! Thanks for taking so much time to chat, greatly appreciate it!”Fans also chimed in with their support: “It'll be much better in Spa, keep pushing,” said one. Another wrote, “Superbe mon Nono,” praising his efforts. One quirky comment read: “Waiting for Norman to play padel with Max & Charles,” along with tennis, racing car and hour glass emojis.In another light-hearted moment on Instagram, Norman shared a selfie taken by one of his teammates on his phone, captioned: “When you leave your phone in the garage while driving.” It echoed a recent post by Formula 1 driver Alex Albon, who had shared selfies taken on his phone after accidentally leaving it behind at a press conference.Also Read: Formula E Drivers Norman Nato and Nyck De Vries compete in FIA World Endurance Championship: Here's how they qualified for 6 Hours of Imola Currently, Norman is recuperating in Andorra, Western Europe.

With five rounds now complete in the 2024–25 Formula E World Championship, there are still 11 races to go before the season concludes in July. In Miami, it was Tag Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein who took the top podium spot. However, despite the win, the German-Mauritian driver currently sits third in the overall drivers' standings.Current driver standings for this seasonLeading the championship is Nissan’s Oliver Rowland with 69 points. Rowland had a tough outing in Miami, finishing 10th and earning just one point. But his overall journey this season has been inspiring—starting the Sao Paulo E-Prix in December with zero points, he bounced back impressively. He clinched victory in the Mexico E-Prix (25 points), finished second in Jeddah Part 1 (18 points), and won Jeddah Part 2 (25 points). Thanks to this strong mid-season performance, his lacklustre Miami result hasn’t dented his lead.In second place is Tag Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa with 54 points. He finished runner-up in both the Sao Paulo and Mexico E-Prix races. While his performance dipped in the Jeddah double-header, he recovered well by finishing third in Miami and collecting 15 crucial points.Close behind is his teammate, Pascal Wehrlein, with 51 points. Wehrlein had a disappointing start in Sao Paulo but bounced back with a third-place finish in Mexico. Although his results in Jeddah were average, his win in Miami has significantly boosted his title hopes. A strong showing in Monaco could push him past Da Costa into second place.Also tied at 51 points is the youngest driver on the grid, Taylor Barnard. He impressed with a third-place finish in Sao Paulo and podiums in both Jeddah races—third in Part 1 and second in Part 2.

Miami E-Prix

Formula E drivers Norman Nato and Nyck De Vries are currently in Italy for the second round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC).

Nato finished 9th, while De Vries secured 5th place in the session.Norman Nato, who races for Nissan in the Formula E Championship, represents Cadillac Racing in collaboration with Hertz Team Jota in the Hypercar category of the Endurance Championship. Nyck De Vries, from Mahindra Racing’s Formula E team, finished 5th in the Imola qualifying. He competes for Toyota Gazoo Racing in the WEC, alongside teammate Ryo Hirakawa, who placed 4th in qualifying.Calling it his best effort on track, De Vries told Toyota Europe Newsroom: “As a team, I think we can be fairly satisfied with qualifying fourth and fifth here. We maximised our package, as you can see from the tiny gap between the two cars. I don’t think we could have done much better than that; we did a strong job to execute a clean qualifying. The gap to the front cars looks quite big over one lap, but we will do our best with race pace, tyre management, and strategy to challenge for the podium.”Both drivers are now set to compete in the final race of the 6 Hours of Imola on Sunday, scheduled from 1 PM to 7 PM local time.In their last Formula E outing at the Homestead-Miami Speedway, Nato faced heartbreak after losing what looked like a sure win due to post-race penalties. Although he clinched pole and crossed the line first at the Miami E-Prix, he was relegated to 6th place in the revised results.De Vries had qualified 5th in Miami but ultimately dropped to 11th in the final standings after penalties were applied.Following this, they’ll shift focus to Round 6 of the Formula E World Championship—the highly anticipated Monaco double-header on May 3 and 4.

His last podium came in Season 9, when he was part of Mahindra Racing.The 40-year-old shared his journey to the podium after the win. He said, “It’s very hard to start the project from zero so in the four races, I had four critical problems that pretty much didn’t allow me to finish the race. So I was like, it’s extremely (tough), you need to have a lot of discipline to be able to continue the work and continue to push when you have bad results.”“When you have good results, it’s very easy. But when you have bad results, to go back home, keep the focus, keep the head down and keep doing the work that you do that at one point it’s going to pay off. It’s hard because you work, it doesn’t. Then you work again, it doesn’t pay off again. And then you keep working until it pays off. And today was a day it paid off. So I am very happy.”It was also emotional to see Di Grassi’s wife, Bianca Diniz Caloi, and their young children standing alongside him on the podium as they popped the champagne. Buzzing with confidence, the driver is now aiming to keep the momentum going at the next race in Monaco.

How Nico Mueller secured the top spot

Andretti driver Nico Mueller and his race engineer Bertrand Mermine have surged to the top of the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard following a dramatic Miami Grand Prix, where post-race penalties reshuffled the final standings in Mueller’s favour. Though he originally crossed the line in 10th, Mueller was promoted to 4th, thanks to a well-timed strategy and a dash of late-race chaos. His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace. The season concludes with an award for the top-ranked pairing.After Round 5 in Miami, the leaderboard has Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne and his race engineer Thibault Arnal on number 2. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries and race engineer Tom Bayles are in third position in the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard.The FIA Formula E Instagram account also shared the update, posting:“@nico.mueller51 overtaking his way up the rankings! With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued. Drivers including Norman Nato, Robin Frijns, Oliver Rowland, Sam Bird, and Taylor Barnard were penalized 10 seconds each for misuse of Attack Mode, while Nick Cassidy received a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits.Also Read: Formula E Miami E-Prix 2025: Jake Hughes crashes at chicane, here’s how the multi-car collision changed the outcome.

He faced a penalty for misuse of the Attack Mode and was disqualified from the race, while Pascal Wehrlein of TAG Heuer Porsche was declared the winner. However, the decision was soon changed, with Nato being pushed back to sixth position, bringing a slight breather for the Nissan driver.Nato had been missing from the scene ever since the terrible fate he suffered at the iconic Homestead-Miami Speedway.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Irfan Pathan has offered a blunt critique of Virat Kohli 's recent performances, particularly his persistent issues with shots outside the off-stump. Speaking on Star Sports after India's heavy 184-run defeat to Australia in the Boxing Day Test, Pathan highlighted Kohli's struggles as a key factor in India's underwhelming display.""Both the seniors (Rohit and Virat) did not meet expectations. They did not meet their own expectations at all. They are making mistakes,"" Pathan said, addressing the form of both Kohli and skipper Rohit Sharma Focusing on Kohli's long-standing tendency to chase deliveries outside the off-stump, Pathan expressed frustration over the lack of correction in the batter's technique.""The shot by Virat Kohli - this is neither the first nor the last time. He is not letting go of the temptation to drive outside the off-stump,"" Pathan remarked, adding that the issue has plagued Kohli for years.Pathan also questioned why Kohli, renowned for his off-field discipline and meticulous preparation, has struggled to bring the same focus to his batting.""We all talk about his discipline - why can't he bring that discipline onto the field?"" Pathan asked, highlighting a puzzling inconsistency in Kohli's approach.Kohli's scores of 36 and 5 in the first and second innings, respectively, were emblematic of India's broader batting failures as they fell to a 2-1 series deficit in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy .With just one Test remaining in Sydney, India face an uphill task to reclaim the series and maintain hopes of qualifying for the ICC World Test Championship Final.",Former Indian cricketer Irfan Pathan criticises Virat Kohli's recent performances.

NEW DELHI: The Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) ended in high drama, with Australia clinching a 184-run victory over India in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25. Former India head coach Ravi Shastri pointed to Rishabh Pant 's dismissal as the pivotal moment that swung the match in favour of the hosts.""The wicket of Rishabh Pant was crucial,"" Shastri stated during post-match analysis on Star Sports. ""Once India lost three wickets by lunchtime, their chances of winning were slim. The only hope was for a strong platform to be set, and when Pant got out after tea, it gave Australia the lift they needed. That was the opening they were waiting for, and they capitalised on it.""India's hopes rested on a determined 88-run partnership between Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) and Pant (30) for the fourth wicket, which kept the visitors in contention during the final day. However, Pant's dismissal, caught off Travis Head's part-time spin, marked a turning point. Moments later, Jaiswal's controversial dismissal via a TV umpire review added to India's woes.The Australian attack, led by Player of the Match Pat Cummins (3/28) and Nathan Lyon (2/37), ensured no further resistance, with Lyon claiming the final wicket of Mohammed Siraj to spark jubilant celebrations among the 74,000-strong crowd.The victory handed Australia a 2-1 lead in the five-match series, putting them in prime position to reclaim the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and secure a place in the ICC World Test Championship Final at Lord's in 2025. For India, the loss leaves their qualification hopes hanging by a thread, with a must-win situation in the series finale in Sydney.Australia's victory was a testament to their collective effort, but as Shastri emphasised, the decisive blow came when Pant departed.

NEW DELHI: India's chances of qualifying for the World Test Championship final for the third consecutive time suffered a major blow as they lost the Boxing Day Test against Australia by 184 runs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Monday. Chasing a record 340-run target, India were all out for 155 in the final session of the fifth and final day of the fourth Test.Meanwhile, Australia have bettered their chances to face South Africa in the WTC Final at Lord's next year with the win. The Proteas have booked their spot in the WTC final after a thrilling two-wicket win over Pakistan at SuperSport Park, Centurion on Sunday.With the victory, Australia also took an unassailable 2-1 lead in the five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy series, with the final Test scheduled to start from Friday, January 3, at the Sydney Cricket Ground.Young opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rishabh Pant kept India's hopes alive till tea break on the final day, but one false shot from the latter triggered a batting collapse which resulted in the visitors losing seven wickets for just 34 runs in the end.As India lost the plot in the WTC Final race, let's recap how they suffered the big defeat at the MCG:Australia promised to throw something different at India with the inclusion of batting prodigy 19-year-old Sam Konstas in the playing XI for the MCG Test and it turned out to be true. Konstas came out of syllabus for the Indian attack on the opening day of the Test after Pat Cummins opted to bat first after winning the toss.Konstas attacked Indian bowlers, including the impressive Jasprit Bumrah , and set the tone for the Australian innings. The youngster smashed 60 off 65 balls, with the help of two sixes and six fours, and added a quick 89 runs for the opening wicket in just 19.2 overs. His pyrotechnics helped the hosts top-order batters, who were out-of-form in the series, to get back into the groove as they fired in unison.Konstas' opening partner Usman Khawaja scored 57, off 121 balls, and No.3 batter Marnus Labuschagne contributed 72, off 175 balls. India fought back a bit in the final session of the opening day by taking four wickets, but Australia finished the day at 311 for 6 with Steve Smith batting on 68* along with Cummins (8*).The second day, especially the first session, belonged to Australia's batting maestro Steve Smith. Smith completed his 34th Test hundred in the morning and set a new record of most centuries against India in Test cricket history. It was his 11th Test hundred against India, one more than the previous record of 10 he shared with England's Joe Root. Smith scored a majestic 140, off 197 balls, which included three maximums and 13 fours before he was clean bowled by Akash Deep. By then Australia had breached the 450-run mark in their first innings.Smith added a valuable 112 runs for the seventh wicket Cummins (49 off 63) to lead the Australian innings. And the duo played a big role in Australia posting a mammoth 474 runs in their first essay.India started their first innings on the wrong foot again. Captain Rohit Sharma decided to promote himself to the opening spot, but failed to contribute. Two early wickets and India were reeling at 51/2 at tea on Day 2. Jaiswal and Virat Kohli steadied the innings and rebuilt it to a comfortable 153/2, before a big mix-up between the youngster and the veteran batter ended the former's stay in the middle.Jaiswal walked back after a brilliant 82, off 118 balls, and seven balls later Kohli's patience broke as he edged one to keeper Alex Carey off Scott Boland. India's situation worsened when nightwatchman Akash Deep too fell in the penultimate over of the day as India were reduced to 164/5 at stumps.Rishabh Pant (28) and Ravindra Jadeja (17) got the start but failed to play a longer innings and India were on the verge of follow-on again, at 221/7, when Nitish Kumar Reddy was joined by Washington Sundar in the middle on Day 3. India needed 54 more to make Australia bat again in the match. But what happened next was pure magic for India.Nitish Reddy and Sundar kept the Aussie attack at bay with some prolific batting as the duo helped India avoid follow-on first and frustrated the hosts with a century partnership. They added a terrific 127 runs for the 8th wicket to take India to a comfortable 348/8 when Sundar was dismissed by Nathan Lyon. Sundar scored a patient 50 off 162 balls.Then Nitish Reddy scored his maiden Test hundred in his debut series, with No.11 batter Mohammed Siraj keeping one end intact to the amusement of the crowd at the MCG. Reddy's hundred took India to 358/9 at the close of the third day's play.After India finished at 369 all out with the dismissal of Nitish Reddy on day four at 114, Australia made a cautious start after getting a 105-run first innings lead.Bumrah came to the fore for India in the second session of the fourth day with his record breaking 200th wicket, making him the only bowler with sub-20 average among those with 200 or more wickets in Test history. And along with Mohammed Siraj, who came back to wicket-taking ways, India grabbed four Australian wickets in the mid session of Day 4 to reduce Australia 91/6. But dropped catches began to hurt India as Jaiswal missed three big chances in the hosts’ second innings.Riding on the chances provided by the drop catches, Labuschagne (70) and Cummins (41) stretched Australia's lead to past the 250-run mark with a 57-run stand for the seventh wicket. After that Australia's last wicket partnership of 61 runs between Lyon (41) and Boland (15 not out) set India a target of 340 on the final day.India's run chase started on a disastrous note, as they lost three batters for 33 at lunch on the final day. Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul and Virat Kohli failed to put up any fight against the Aussie pacers in the morning session. With the visitors in dire situation after the top-order failures, Jaiswal and Pant put up a fightback to keep India's hopes alive.The duo played out the entire second session, scoring 79 runs in it. But the start of the final session saw Pant going for a pull shot off Travis Head only to be out caught in the deep by Mitchell Marsh. The end of the 88-run stand triggered the familiar India batting collapse as they were all out for 155 from a comfortable position of 121 for 3 in the final session.Jaiswal top-scored for India in the second innings with 84, off 208 balls, before falling to a controversial third umpire decision. While Pant contributed 30, no other batters managed to reach double figures as India suffered a humiliating 184 runs defeat in Melbourne.","India's chances of qualifying for World Test Championship final suffered a major blow as they lost the Boxing Day Test against Australia by 184 runs.

However, Saikat ruled the decision in the favour of the bowler, leaving Jaiswal shocked.The batter, who had scored 82 in the first innings, was visibly unhappy and walked up to the umpires on the field to check.

South Africa secured their spot in the World Test Championship (WTC) final after a thrilling two-wicket victory against Pakistan in Centurion.This makes them the first team to qualify for the final, scheduled to be held at Lord's next June.Three teams—Australia, India, and Sri Lanka—are vying for the remaining spot.

NEW DELHI: India skipper Rohit Sharma voiced concerns over Jasprit Bumrah 's heavy workload and lack of bowling support following India's 184-run defeat in the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.Bumrah, India's pace spearhead, delivered a masterclass with match figures of 9-156, including a five-wicket haul in the third innings, taking his series tally to 30 wickets. His exceptional performance also saw him become the fastest Indian pacer to 200 Test wickets and the first bowler in history to maintain a sub-20 average among bowlers with 200 or more Test scalps.However, Bumrah's herculean efforts were not enough to secure victory, as Rohit highlighted the physical toll on the pacer and the absence of adequate support from the other end.""There is a risk of over-bowling Bumrah, but when someone is in form, you tend to bowl him more,"" Rohit admitted during the post-match press briefing, reflecting on the pacer's workload.Rohit had relied heavily on Bumrah throughout the match. Bumrah's exhaustion was evident by the end of Day 4, when the pacer was heard telling his captain, ""Bus ab, ab bilkul dum nahi lag raha (No more. I can't put in any more effort).""The skipper also lamented the lack of support for Bumrah, which he felt had been a persistent issue.""Absolutely brilliant. We've been watching him for so many years now, coming here and getting the job done. He's not a statistical person. He just wants to play for the country and do well for the team, but unfortunately, he's not got a lot of support from the other side,"" Rohit said, praising Bumrah's selfless approach.Team India's chances of qualifying for a third consecutive World Test Championship final took a significant hit with the defeat. Chasing a challenging target of 340 runs, India faltered to 155 all out, losing seven wickets for just 34 runs in the final session.Young opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rishabh Pant kept India's hopes alive until tea with a gritty partnership, but the collapse that followed underscored the team's vulnerabilities.With the series now 2-1 in Australia's favour and the final Test set to begin at the Sydney Cricket Ground on January 3, the pressure is on India to manage Bumrah's workload effectively and find the much-needed support for their ace pacer.","India skipper Rohit Sharma voiced concerns over Jasprit Bumrah's heavy workload and lack of bowling support following India's 184-run defeat in the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.Bumrah delivered a masterclass with match figures of 9-156, including a five-wicket haul in the third innings.

India, chasing a target of 340, adopted a cautious approach during their innings. Australia's bowlers maintained consistent pressure with high-quality deliveries, forcing Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal to restrain their attacking instincts. This allowed Australia to establish a dominant rhythm.Speaking exclusively on Star Sports, former Indian head coach Ravi Shastri shared his thoughts on Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma's performances in the ongoing series.""Virat batted well in the first innings. He'll be disappointed with the way he's getting out because there's a pattern—driving outside the off stump. He could leave those deliveries. As far as Rohit Sharma goes, at times we've seen in the series that his front foot isn't really moving towards the ball as much as it should. There’s a trigger movement, but then the leg stays planted. Mitchell Starc set Virat Kohli up beautifully. An over before that, there were some good leaves from Virat, but they were challenging the off stump. And here, he floated one outside, tempting Virat—'should I leave it, should I play'—just before lunch. Virat would have been very disappointed,"" Shastri said.Rohit Sharma's attempt at an aggressive shot led to his dismissal. Aiming to whip a Pat Cummins delivery through the leg side, he edged the ball to gully, departing for nine runs off 40 balls.On the final ball of the same over, KL Rahul edged a back-of-a-length delivery from Cummins to second slip and was dismissed for a five-ball duck.Just before lunch, Kohli attempted an expansive drive off Mitchell Starc's full-length delivery and was caught at first slip for five off 29 balls.Shastri then expressed his opinion on Rishabh Pant, saying, ""I think the turning point was the wicket of Rishabh Pant. They knew they couldn't win the game by lunchtime once they lost three wickets. The only chance you have of winning is if there’s a platform set, exactly what Rohit said in the press conference. And then, when Rishabh Pant got out after tea, that lifted the Australians. That was the opening they were looking for, and they made sure to capitalise on it."" he concluded.Rishabh Pant and Yashasvi Jaiswal forged an 88-run partnership for the fourth wicket. Pant contributed 30 runs from 104 balls, while Jaiswal's crucial innings yielded 84 runs. Their partnership provided a glimmer of hope for India in their challenging chase.With India seemingly aiming for a draw, Pant's aggressive approach led to his dismissal. Attempting a powerful shot off Travis Head's bowling, he was caught at long-on, handing Australia a crucial breakthrough at 121-4.Following Pant's dismissal, India lost three wickets in quick succession for just nine runs. Scott Boland dismissed Ravindra Jadeja, caught behind, and Nitish Kumar Reddy edged a Nathan Lyon delivery to slip.Yashasvi Jaiswal, who had anchored the Indian innings, eventually fell for 84, dismissed by Pat Cummins. His patient knock provided resistance but ultimately couldn't prevent India's collapse.Scott Boland further deepened India's woes by dismissing Akash Deep and later Jasprit Bumrah .

'ROHIT KNEW YASHASVI WAS INDIA’S FUTURE'

NEW DELHI: Disappointment and frustration were clearly visible on Yashasvi Jaiswal 's face as he fell victim to a controversial dismissal during the final session of day five in the Boxing Day Test at the MCG. The third umpire overturned the on-field not-out decision for a caught-behind, even though the Snickometer showed no edge.Yashasvi, who was anchoring the innings brilliantly and batting on 84, attempted to hook a bouncer from Australian skipper Pat Cummins . He missed the shot entirely, and wicketkeeper Alex Carey claimed the catch. While Carey and Cummins celebrated exuberantly, on-field umpire Joel Wilson initially ruled it not out. Cummins, however, immediately opted for a review.The Snickometer displayed a flat line as the ball passed the bat, regular replays showed a noticeable deflection. Third umpire Sharfuddoula ultimately declared Jaiswal out, to the batter’s disbelief.The decision sparked widespread debate among former cricketers and fans alike. However, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma addressed the controversy during the post-match press conference, seeking to put the matter to rest.""I don't know what to make of that because the technology didn't show anything, but with the naked eye it seemed like he did touch something,"" Rohit told reporters after the match.""I don't know how the umpires want to use the technology, but in all fairness, I think he did touch the ball,"" he said.Yashasvi's childhood coach, Jwala Singh, who was at the MCG to witness the high-stakes match, expressed his shock over the incident but said he found clarity after Rohit addressed the matter.""I was shocked, actually. The umpires took time to make that decision, and there was doubt. So, if there was doubt, the benefit of doubt should have been given to the batter. But if Rohit Sharma, the captain himself, said that there was a deflection or that the ball touched the bat or gloves, then Yashasvi is out. Because the captain knows better than anyone else. I will go with Rohit,"" Jwala told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.Jwala is well aware of Yashasvi's state of mind following the controversial dismissal but remains confident that Rohit, who has been a guiding figure throughout Yashasvi's career as a senior Mumbai teammate and now as India’s captain, will support the youngster through this challenging phase.""Rohit has given him a lot of opportunities and chances. Rohit has backed Yashasvi a lot. He has been his senior in the Mumbai team, and now he is the captain. Yashasvi has learned a lot from Rohit and continues to do so. Yashasvi was very disappointed, and any batter would be disappointed after such a decision. He needs to move on. Rohit will talk to him. Whenever Yashasvi is down or disappointed, Rohit is always there to motivate him and talk to him. He will ask him to move on. Not just Rohit, (Gautam) Gambhir also talks to him and motivates him. Rohit and Gambhir will help Yashasvi overcome this on-field disappointment,"" Jwala said.Yashasvi has been a standout performer in Tests in 2024, amassing 1,478 runs at an average of 54.74, including three centuries and nine fifties in 15 matches (including the MCG Test). His highest score this year was an unbeaten 214 against England.The youngster also surpassed Virender Sehwag’s 2008 tally of 1,462 runs to record the best calendar year for an Indian opener. He now ranks fourth on the all-time list for openers, topped by Graeme Smith’s 1,656 runs in 2008.Jwala recounted a story where Rohit had predicted Yashasvi's bright future for India.""I will share an incident when Yashasvi scored a double century in the Vijay Hazare Trophy some years back. Rohit was present there, and he appreciated Yashasvi and told everyone that this guy has got a bright future and will play for India. Yashasvi became emotional and worked really hard to reach this level. Rohit has always given Yashasvi a lot of support and helped him grow as an international cricketer,"" the coach said.""Yashasvi is a player to watch out for in the future. He was looking good, and I was confident he would take India to a draw or maybe even a win if he had good support from the other end. He was in good touch, but the controversial decision ended his innings. I am happy for him but also unhappy because he missed out on hundreds in both innings. He had a great opportunity to score centuries in both innings,"" he added.",Yashasvi Jaiswal was out for 84 on Day 5 of the Boxing Day Test at the MCG. The third umpire overturned the on-field not-out decision for a caught-behind.

Late Drama and Rain-Shortened Day

Looking Ahead

The first Test between Zimbabwe and Afghanistan in Bulawayo ended in a thrilling draw on Monday, with both teams achieving record-breaking feats.Zimbabwe's first innings saw them amass a colossal 586 runs, surpassing their previous highest Test score of 563/9 against the West Indies in 2001. Afghanistan responded with an even more remarkable 699 all out, establishing their own record for the highest innings total, beating their previous best of 545/4, also achieved against Zimbabwe in 2021.The Afghan innings was highlighted by captain Hashmatullah Shahidi 's historic 246, a national record, and Rahmat Shah's 234. Together, they forged a massive 364-run third-wicket partnership, the highest in Afghanistan's Test history for any wicket. Shahidi’s 246 eclipsed his previous best of 200 against Zimbabwe in Abu Dhabi. Wicketkeeper Afsar Zazai also contributed a maiden Test century with 113 runs, further solidifying Afghanistan's dominance in their first innings.Zimbabwe's Brian Bennett, a 21-year-old spinner in only his second Test, showcased his all-around brilliance. Bennett took a career-best 5/95 in Afghanistan's innings and earlier contributed an unbeaten 110 with the bat in Zimbabwe's first innings.Afghanistan’s innings ended in a collapse, with the last six wickets falling for just 20 runs in four overs, largely due to Bennett's spin. In their second innings, Zimbabwe reached 142/4, avoiding further damage thanks to an unbroken 54-run partnership between veterans Sean Williams (35) and Craig Ervine (22).The match's conclusion was impacted by mid-afternoon rain, which caused a delay of over an hour. Zimbabwe showed resilience, with debutant Ben Curran impressing with 41 runs before a run-out, and opener Joylord Gumbie contributing 24.The second and final Test of the series begins Thursday, also in Bulawayo, with both teams eager to build on the momentum from this high-scoring encounter.For context, Sri Lanka still hold the record for the highest-ever Test innings score with 952/6 declared against India in Colombo in 1997.","The first Test between Zimbabwe and Afghanistan in Bulawayo ended in a thrilling draw on Monday.

It doesn't happen like this that you go there (Australia) and win every time. I think we had an overestimation of our team and we got a reality check,"" Wassan told ANI.India's significant defeat contrasts sharply with their previous tour of Australia. They had secured a 2-1 series victory during that tour.This time, Australia hold a 2-1 lead. The final Test is scheduled to begin in Sydney on Friday.Australia's commanding victory in Melbourne significantly hampered India's chances of reaching the World Test Championship (WTC) final at Lord's.Australia set a challenging target of 340 runs for India on the final day. India were unable to achieve this target, being bowled out for 155 in the 80th over. The Australian bowlers delivered some compelling spells, contributing to India's collapse.Although the game was decided by small margins, Australia dominated India in all aspects of the game. India's first innings struggles at the MCG were followed by a more resilient second innings performance.India's pace attack, led by Jasprit Bumrah , put Australia under pressure, reducing them to 91/6. However, dropped catches and missed opportunities allowed Australia to recover.India's hopes of limiting Australia's lead to 250 runs diminished. Nathan Lyon and Scott Boland's 61-run partnership further solidified Australia's advantage. This partnership ultimately set a 340-run target for India.India's batting lineup struggled to cope with the Australian bowling attack, resulting in their substantial defeat.

A thrilling first Test match between Afghanistan and Zimbabwe ended in a draw after a rain-affected final day in Bulawayo. Both teams showcased impressive batting performances, resulting in record-breaking innings. Hashmatullah Shahidi , the Afghanistan veteran, etched his name in the record books with a monumental 246 runs. Zimbabwean rookie spinner Brian Bennett also shone, claiming five wickets in an impressive spell.Zimbabwe's first innings total of 586 was a national record. Afghanistan responded with an even more remarkable 699, also a national record. Zimbabwe finished their second innings at 142-4, leading Afghanistan by a slender 29 runs.The partnership between Sean Williams (35 not out) and Craig Ervine (22 not out) proved crucial for Zimbabwe. Their unbeaten stand stabilized the innings after Zimbabwe found themselves in a precarious position at 88-4, trailing by 25 runs.Shahidi's marathon innings finally came to an end when he was trapped leg before wicket by Bennett. Bennett's figures of 5-95 were the best among the Zimbabwean bowlers.Shahidi's 246 runs came off 474 balls and included 21 fours. His remarkable innings lasted for 694 minutes at Queens Sports Club.Shahidi's partnerships with Rahmat Shah (364 runs) and Afsar Zazai (211 runs) were instrumental in Afghanistan gaining a substantial 113-run first-innings lead.Shahidi's previous highest Test score was 200 not out, also against Zimbabwe in Abu Dhabi three years ago.Afsar Zazai, the Afghanistan wicketkeeper, celebrated his maiden Test century, scoring 113 before being dismissed. He was caught at backward point by substitute fielder Johnathan Campbell.Shahidi's dismissal triggered a mini-collapse for Afghanistan. The last six wickets tumbled for a mere 20 runs in just four overs, with Bennett's off-spin proving particularly destructive.Bennett, playing in just his second Test, twice came agonizingly close to a hat-trick. He took two wickets in consecutive deliveries on two separate occasions.Bennett also contributed significantly with the bat, scoring an unbeaten 110 in Zimbabwe's first innings. Zimbabwe captain Craig Ervine had won the toss and elected to bat first.In their second innings, Zimbabwe were progressing steadily at 73 runs before Joylord Gumbie (24) edged the ball to Shahidi in the slips.Rain interrupted play shortly after Gumbie's dismissal, causing a one-hour delay.Ben Curran, making his Test debut, impressed with a well-made 41 before being run out. He is the son of the late Kevin Curran, a former Zimbabwe coach, and the brother of England internationals Tom and Sam Curran.Zimbabwe lost three quick wickets – Gumbie, Curran, and Takudzwanashe Kaitano (5) – within the space of just 14 balls.

NEW DELHI: Indian captain Rohit Sharma 's clarification that Shubman Gill was not dropped for the Boxing Day Test against Australia did not sit well with legendary Sunil Gavaskar , who asserted that the decision could only be described as a drop.The decision to drop Gill and accommodate all-rounder Washington Sundar, aimed at strengthening the lower middle-order batting depth, drew criticism.

You need to take decisions based on that, but you left him (Gill) out of the team, you can only call it dropped in whichever language you might speak,"" Gavaskar said.""You can say you omitted or dropped him, both are the same. Omit looks different, drop looks different, and left out looks different. I am talking about English but in the end, that guy was sitting in the dugout and was not on the ground,"" he added.Sundar bowled just 19 overs in the match, taking one wicket across two innings. With the bat, he contributed a responsible 50-run knock in India's first innings and remained unbeaten on five in the second.Chasing a target of 340 on the final day of the fourth Test, the Indian batters struggled once again, with only Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) standing out.

Australian captain Pat Cummins commended Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah , emphasising his significant impact on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series. Cummins hailed Bumrah as India's 'most influential player.'Australia secured a commanding 184-run victory over India in the Melbourne Test , taking a 2-1 lead in the series.Bumrah's bowling prowess was once again on display. In the first innings, he claimed three quick wickets, revitalising India's chances when Australia seemed to have the upper hand. Bumrah continued his impressive form in the second innings, finishing the match with figures of 9/156.He currently tops the wicket-takers' chart in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with 30 wickets at an average of 12.83.During the post-match press conference, Cummins acknowledged the challenges Bumrah posed for Australia throughout the series.“Obviously, a really good bowler in great form. You know, he's been their most influential player. He's made it difficult for us at times. I thought all their bowlers bowled really well yesterday.

Pat Cummins on India’s approach on Day 5, Rishabh Pant’s shot and Travis Head’s celebration

NEW DELHI: Former cricketers and experts have touted Shubman Gill as the next big thing ever since he announced his arrival on the international scene. But a string of promising starts lately that he hasn't been able to convert into big innings has probably left India's chief coach frustrated, feels former England spinner Monty Panesar Gill, who averages 35.76 for his 1860 runs across 57 innings in 31 Tests, was dropped from the Melbourne Test for off-spin all-rounder Washington Sundar. Though Sundar did play his part with the bat scoring 50 in a 127-run partnership with centurion Nitish Reddy (114), the move to drop Gill and move KL Rahul to No. 3 so that Rohit can return as opener didn't help sort India's batting woes.India's first-innings total of 369 in Melbourne was only made possible by the knocks played by all-rounders Reddy and Sundar while the specialist batters, barring Yashasvi Jaiswal, failed once again. In the second innings, India could muster only 155.Chasing 340 to win, India's last 7 wickets fell for just 34 runs despite Jaiswal following up his 82 in the first innings with 84 in the second.Will that mean Gill returning to the top order for the last Test in Sydney, which India need to win to make it 2-2 and retain theBorder Gavaskar Trophy ?""Gill hasn't performed like he needs to as a number three. I think he gets (good) starts and then gets out,"" said Panesar talking to""I think he is promising, but hasn't really kicked...averages like 36 (in Tests). To be honest, that needs to be like 45 (with) the talent that he has.""Gill has featured in just two of the four Tests played so far in this Border Gavaskar Trophy. He missed the first Test in Perth with a thumb fracture and was dropped for the fourth in Melbourne. In between, his three innings brought him just 60 runs with knocks of 31, 28 and 1.He got off to good starts in the pink-ball Test at Adelaide but failed to make it count.""Sometimes he gets a little bit lazy or lethargic with his footwork, just gets out when he makes a good start,"" Panesar analysed. ""India are in a nice position and then he just gets out. I think Gambhir is probably frustrated with that thing. Enough's enough,"" felt Panesar.He added that getting dropped from the Melbourne Test should work as a ""wake-up call"" for Gill.""He's a better player than that. He shouldn't be averaging just 36 in Test cricket. He's had a lot of chances and he's getting a little bit complacent, you know, thinking that 'Oh, I have the talent, I'll just keep playing, I'll keep getting better'."", the former left-arm spinner said.Interestingly, Rohit was asked how he views the situation with the 25-year-old Gill, especially after India's big 284-run defeat in Melbourne.""I had a chat with him...and the chat was clearly (that) he was not dropped. We just wanted to have that extra bit of cushion in the bowling and hence we opted for an allrounder (Sundar), which would not weaken our batting lineup. Compromising a batter for a bowler was not something that I wanted to do,"" said Rohit.""With him, there was never a doubt that he was not batting well or he was not scoring runs or anything like that. It was just to get that combination where we can cover both bases - batting and bowling. We opted for that option, of course,"" the skipper added.The fifth and final Test in Sydney begins on January 3.",Shubman Gill was dropped from the Melbourne Test for off-spin all-rounder Washington Sundar.

Former Indian all-rounder Irfan Pathan has expressed concerns regarding India’s Test captain, Rohit Sharma ’s position in the team, given his ongoing poor form. This follows India’s 184-run defeat in the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Pathan suggests that Rohit’s place in the team is primarily due to his captaincy, rather than his batting performance.Rohit’s struggles with the bat have become a talking point, particularly after a series of low scores in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy. His poor form is considered a major contributing factor to India’s disappointing performance against Australia.In five innings, Rohit has scored a mere 31 runs, averaging 6.20, including two ducks. This is the second-lowest series average for an Indian top-six batter in Tests played in Australia.His difficulty in converting starts and apparent lack of rhythm against Australia’s bowling attack have placed him under significant pressure. On Day 5, Rohit faced 40 balls, scoring only nine runs before being dismissed by“A player who has made about 20,000 runs—yet the way Rohit is struggling now, it seems his form is not supporting him at all. What’s happening now is that he is the captain, so he is playing. If he were not the captain, he might not be playing right now. You would have had a set team. K.L. Rahul would have been playing at the top, Jaiswal would have been there, Shubman Gill would have been there. If we talk about reality, considering how he is struggling with the bat, there might not have been a place for him in the playing XI,” Irfan Pathan told Star Sports.Pathan believes that without the captaincy, players like KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal , or Shubman Gill would be more likely to open the innings, given their current form. He contends that Rohit’s position is secured by his captaincy, especially with India needing a win to draw the series.“But because he is the captain, and you want to win the next match to draw the series, he stays in the team. But his form is so poor. Even in India, even before coming here, he wasn’t scoring runs, and he still hasn’t scored runs. This is a very disappointing scene when I see Rohit Sharma batting. Because whenever I see Rohit Sharma batting, I always want to see him bat, whether it is Test cricket or one-day cricket. But now, his form, the way he is going forward, whether it is his mindset or the coordination with his body, I can’t see that at all,” he added.Rohit’s performance in early 2024 against England, where he scored 455 runs, presented a stark contrast to his current struggles. The series against England fuelled hopes of a Test resurgence, but his form has since declined significantly.The Boxing Day Test highlighted Rohit’s vulnerabilities against the Australian attack. Despite occasional displays of resilience, he failed to make a substantial contribution. His longest innings in the series, a 40-ball, nine-run effort, epitomises his difficulties throughout the tour.","Former Indian all-rounder Irfan Pathan has expressed concerns regarding India’s Test captain, Rohit Sharma ’s position in the team, given his ongoing poor form.

'Clear evidence he hit it': Pat Cummins on Yashasvi Jaiswal's dismissal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/clear-evidence-he-hit-it-pat-cummins-on-yashasvi-jaiswals-dismissal/articleshow/116800374.cms,"Rohit Sharma press conference: On his batting, captaincy, future, Rishabh Pant’s shot and more

Pat Cummins on India’s approach on Day 5, Rishabh Pant’s shot and Travis Head’s celebration

Australian captain Pat Cummins discussed the contentious dismissal of Yashasvi Jaiswal and Australia's victory in the fourth Test against India. He addressed the technology used in the decision and praised his team's performance.Cummins stated his certainty about Jaiswal's edge, despite the lack of a clear spike on the Snicko technology. He pointed to other evidence supporting the decision.He highlighted the visible deviation of the ball and the audible noise upon impact. He also mentioned Jaiswal's reaction, suggesting the batter himself knew he had edged the ball.""Oh look, I think it was just clear that he hit it. We heard a noise, saw a deviation, so it was absolutely certain that he hit it. As soon as we referred it, you could see him drop his head and basically acknowledge that he hit it. On the screen you can see he hit it,"" Cummins said at the post-match press conference.Despite his confidence in the decision, Cummins expressed reservations about the reliability of the Ultra Edge technology. He acknowledged the lack of a definitive spike on the Snicko. However, he felt other evidence sufficiently supported the umpire's decision.""Ultra-edge… I don't think anyone has complete confidence in it and didn't really show much but fortunately there's enough other evidence to show it was clearly out,"" he added.Shifting his focus to the match, Cummins lauded his team's bowling performance, particularly in the first session. He described their effort as near perfect, highlighting their ability to restrict India's scoring opportunities.He specifically mentioned the dismissals of key Indian batsmen Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli , and KL Rahul early in the innings. This, he believed, significantly hampered India's ability to mount a comeback.""To be honest, I reckon that the first session was close to perfection from a bowling point of view. I thought we were excellent.""All the guys didn't really give any bad balls away. I didn't know what their plan was going to be but honestly I don't think we really gave them the chance to to fight back at us too much,"" the skipper said.Cummins compared the significance of this victory to Australia's win against England at Edgbaston in the 2023 Ashes series. He considered both wins equally important.""I reckon this (victory) is right at the top. Yeah, Edgbaston (2023) was pretty special and I reckon this is pretty much on par,"" he added.Looking ahead, Cummins emphasized the importance of rest and recovery before the final Test match in Sydney. He acknowledged the short turnaround time between matches.He indicated the team would celebrate their victory but also prioritize recovery to prepare for the next challenge. He suggested a mix of celebration and rest for the players.""Yeah, you know it's a short turnaround so yeah I think we'll definitely save you this one. You work so hard over five days to win a Test match like this and I'm sure there'll be a lot of sitting around tonight and a couple of boys might have a beer,"" he said.""Some others might not have, you know, water and some protein shakes and an early night but we'll save this for a couple hours at least and then it'll be recovery for the next few days.""I'm sure the batters will have a hit, the bowlers I dare say will be very light on and then you gear up again for the last Test of the summer. So, mix of happiness and rest I reckon the next three days,"" he noted.",Australia captain Pat Cummins discussed the contentious dismissal of Yashasvi Jaiswal and Australia's victory in the fourth Test against India. He addressed the technology used in the decision and praised his team's performance.

Nitish Reddy reveals Virat Kohli’s special words for him after hundred at MCG

London: Liverpool moved a step closer to a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title as a 5-0 thrashing of West Ham opened up an eight-point lead at the top of the Premier League Luis Diaz , Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah , Trent Alexander-Arnold and Diogo Jota were on target for the rampant Reds in east London as they ended the year as huge favourites to deliver just a second league title in 35 years.Nottingham Forest are the surprise closest challengers in second, but Arsenal and Chelsea can close the gap when they are in action later in the week.Arne Slot has repeatedly stressed nothing can be won yet with Liverpool still one game shy of the halfway mark in the Premier League.But the Dutchman's succession of Jurgen Klopp continues to look flawless after a 23rd win in 27 matches in all competitions.""I enjoyed it a lot because it doesn't happen many times that I could just sit back and enjoy,"" said Slot.Diaz had been rested for the 3-1 win over Leicester on Boxing Day and it was the Colombian who opened the floodgates on 30 minutes at the London Stadium.His intended pass into Curtis Jones rebounded back into his path off a West Ham defender and he dispatched his shot low into the corner.Mohammed Kudus was inches away from an equaliser when his effort came back off the post.But another heavy home defeat puts Hammers boss Julen Lopetegui back under pressure after a four-game unbeaten run.""We are talking about the best team in the Premier League and around the world, but at home and in front of our fans, I am very sorry about this,"" said Lopetegui.Two goals in four minutes just before half-time killed the game as a contest.Salah's delightful turn helped tee up Gakpo to roll in his ninth goal in 14 games.The Egyptian then curled in at Alphonse Areola's near post, with some help from the West Ham goalkeeper, to hit the 20-goal mark for the eighth consecutive season since joining Liverpool in 2017.Speculation over Alexander-Arnold, Salah and Virgil van Dijk's futures has not derailed Liverpool's flying start under Slot.All three could discuss a move to a foreign club on a free transfer next season within days, but remain focused for the moment on winning a second Premier League title together.""The only thing in my mind is that I want Liverpool to win the league and I want to be part of it,"" said Salah.""That is the only thing I have focused on. I will do my best to win the trophy. We are in the right direction but there are other teams trying to catch up with us. We just need to stay humble and go again.""Rumours over Alexander-Arnold's potential move to Real Madrid have resurfaced again in the Spanish media over the past week and the England international showed why he is a man in demand with a thunderous strike that deflected in off Max Kilman.Jota's appearance as a substitute was further evidence of the extra firepower Liverpool enjoy over their title rivals.The Portuguese set the seal on a dominant win with the finish for the fifth goal, but had another sumptuous Salah assist to thank for it.Salah jinked his way beyond three West Ham defenders before laying the ball to Jota for his 13th Premier League assist of the season to go with 17 goals in 18 games.","Liverpool thrash West Ham 5-0 at the London Stadium.

NEW DELHI: Pep Guardiola 's Manchester City secured a much-needed 2-0 victory over Leicester City on Sunday, ending a run of eight away games without a win.The victory provided some relief for the crisis-hit English champions , who have been struggling with a remarkable slump in form.The first half saw City take the lead through Savinho's strike, but Leicester squandered several chances to equalize, with Jamie Vardy and James Justin missing golden opportunities.After the break, Erling Haaland doubled City's lead with a powerful header, scoring his 19th goal of the season and ending his four-game goal drought.Despite the win, City's performance was still far from the standards they have set in recent years, having won an unprecedented four consecutive English top-flight titles.However, the celebrations after Haaland's goal showed that the three points were all that mattered for the visitors, temporarily halting their slump.The victory lifted City to fifth place in the Premier League table, but they remain 11 points behind leaders Liverpool , who have two games in hand. For Leicester, the defeat leaves them rooted in the bottom three, adding to their struggles this season.While City's performance was not at their usual level, the win provides a much-needed boost for Guardiola's side as they look to regain their form and mount a challenge for the title. However, with Liverpool's lead and games in hand, City face an uphill battle to defend their crown.","Manchester City beat Leicester City 2-0 on Sunday.

Lautaro back in the goals

Atalanta kept hold of top spot in Serie A on Saturday after escaping Lazio with a 1-1 draw which kept Inter Milan at bay but ended their club-record league winning streak at 11 matches.Marco Brescianini tapped home into an open goal with two minutes remaining to snatch a point from the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, where a passionate crowd thought a big win was coming their way.Instead Atalanta will end a historic year a point ahead of Inter, who have a game in hand, after the champions briefly drew level on points with a 3-0 win earlier at Cagliari .Europa League holders Atalanta will lead the league even if Napoli beat Venezia on Sunday and draw level on 41 points with Gian Piero Gasperini 's side who have a significantly better goal difference than the 2023 champions.Should two teams finish level at the top of Serie A come the end of the season they will face off in a single match to decide the destination of the Scudetto, which Atalanta have never won.""We struggled for long periods in the first half, but we were much better in the second,"" said Atalanta coach Gasperini.""This year has been the best year in Atalanta's history, let's hope we can make 2025 the same.""Atalanta showed great character to battle back from Fisayo Dele-Bashiru's 27th-minute goal which came in an intense opening period from Lazio.The away side were initially blitzed by Lazio, with Marco Carnesecchi making two sensational stops before Matteo Guendouzi curled a great strike off the post in the 11th minute.But as the match wore on, Atalanta, who were without injured star striker Mateo Retegui, grew into the game and deservedly drew level in front of a boisterous and hostile crowd in the Italian capital.Brescianini netted his third goal of the season thanks largely to Ademola Lookman, who made up for earlier missing from yards out by beating Lazio's offside trap, meeting Nicolo Zaniolo's hooked pass and rolling across to his teammate to salvage a precious point.Next up, Atalanta travel to play the Italian Super Cup in Saudi Arabia, where they will face Inter on Thursday.Lautaro Martinez ended an eight-match scoring drought at Cagliari, netting the second in an engaging contest in Sardinia which Inter won with second-half goals from the Argentina striker, Alessandro Bastoni and Hakan Calhanoglu.Inter have won their last five in Italy's top flight, scoring 19 and conceding just once, a burst in form which has re-established Inter as favourites to retain the Scudetto.The only thing missing for Inter were goals from captain Martinez, who hadn't scored since November 3 before he prodded home Nicolo Barella's cross in the 71st minute on Saturday.""The most important thing is that Inter win. If I get a goal too, then that's a bonus,"" said Martinez.""We work hard every day to win trophies and anyone who sets foot on the pitch will give their all for the team. We've just got to keep going and make 2025 like this year.""Inter could have won by an even more convincing margin had captain Martinez not wasted great chances in each half and Cagliari goalkeeper Simone Scuffet not pulled off superb saves to deny Marcus Thuram and Barella.But Martinez did net his seventh goal this season in all competitions and seven minutes later Calhanoglu made absolutely sure of the points from the penalty spot.Cagliari are just inside the relegation zone after a fourth consecutive defeat for Davide Nicola's side, a point behind Verona and Como who both play on Monday.",Atalanta draw 1-1 with Lazio at Stadio Olimpico in Rome.

NEW DELHI: 22-year-old Ivory Coast forward Amad Diallo has expressed his determination to ""make history"" with Manchester United despite the club's recent struggles under new manager Ruben Amorim .United have lost five out of Amorim's first 10 games in charge across all competitions, with recent defeats to Wolves, Bournemouth, and Tottenham increasing the pressure on the Portuguese manager ahead of Newcastle's visit to Old Trafford.Despite the team's dismal form, which has seen them languish in 14th place in the Premier League , just eight points above the relegation zone , Diallo has been one of United's few bright spots.He scored a late winner in the recent derby against Manchester City and has contributed two goals and six assists in the league this season.Diallo, along with other young players like Alejandro Garnacho, Kobbie Mainoo, Joshua Zirkzee, and Rasmus Hojlund, has set his sights on taking United back to the top.""We are part of the project, we have so many young players for this club, especially Garna (Alejandro Garnacho), Kobbie (Mainoo), Joshua (Zirkzee), Rasmus (Hojlund), me, we are young players who want to make history for this club,"" Diallo told MUTV.""We want to do our best every game. Sometimes it cannot work, but you can see in the pitch we are very focused to do our best for this club, because we want to bring back this club to the level it was before.""So, for the young lads, we just have to keep going, work hard and the most important thing is to listen to the old men, the old players, learn every day.""We have now a new manager, he likes to work with young players, and he brings a new system, so we just have to follow it and try to do our best every game.""""In football this can happen,"" he added.

NEW DELHI: Pep Guardiola has affirmed his commitment to Manchester City , dismissing speculation about his departure amidst the club's recent struggles.Guardiola recently extended his contract for two more years.Despite City's current poor form, Guardiola is determined to remain at the Etihad Stadium. The team has experienced a significant dip in performance, losing nine out of their last thirteen matches.The slump has led to questions about Guardiola's future with the club. Some have suggested he might leave if he can't reverse the team's fortunes.However, Guardiola, who has guided City to six Premier League titles in seven seasons, insisted he remains motivated to turn things around.""I will try, I will keep going. Sometimes you think the bad run will be ended earlier or it would be easier to fix it, but it takes more time,"" he said.""I will not give up. I want to be here. I want to do it and, with the situation that we have, we have to do it.""Of course I want it, everyone wants it. I don't want to disappoint my people in terms of the club, the fans, the people who love this club.""I think all of us in our job want to do it well and please the people. That is undeniable, not a question mark.""The biggest test is to come back again, but we have done that before.""Injuries have significantly hampered City's performance, contributing to their current seventh-place standing in the Premier League. Key players have been sidelined due to various injuries.Rodri, the Ballon d'Or winner, is recovering from a long-term knee injury. Other key players, including Ruben Dias, John Stones, Ederson, Kyle Walker, Jack Grealish, and Matheus Nunes, missed the recent draw against Everton.Even Erling Haaland, typically a prolific goal scorer, has struggled recently. He missed a penalty in the Everton match, extending his recent goal drought.Haaland has scored only once in his last seven games, but Guardiola refused to single him out for criticism. He emphasized his philosophy of not assigning blame to individual players.""I don't have it in my education to start complaining, to point at people. It's happened, it's life, it's football, so let's try it again,"" he said.""That's why we have had success, because always it is never enough, we will try it again and again and again. That's why we won a lot of titles.""Every three days it was a game and win, win, win for many, many months and years. Now we have to do the same when results are not good.""As City prepares to face Leicester City, several players are still recovering from injuries. Guardiola acknowledged the impact of injuries on the team's performance.""Sometimes you have injuries,"" Guardiola said. ""For how many years we were incredibly consistent but now, yes, we're a little bit down and the main reason is having so many important players injured.""But I saw the team spirit, how we trained this week, how focused they are, how they try to practise.""","Guardiola recently extended his contract for two more years.

The strike from Kai Havertz proved decisive as Arsenal secured a 1-0 victory against Ipswich , advancing to second position in the Premier League standings, while Bukayo Saka remained absent after his hamstring injury in the match against Crystal Palace last weekend.Arsenal's win reduced Premier League leaders Liverpool 's advantage to six points on Friday, as they capitalised on Chelsea's unexpected 2-1 loss to Fulham on Thursday to emerge as Liverpool's nearest rivalSaka, meanwhile, might not return until March due.Arsenal's manager opted to position Gabriel Martinelli on the right flank, typically occupied by Saka, whilst maintaining Gabriel Jesus as the central striker following his impressive tally of five goals in the previous two matches.Despite controlling much of the ball, the hosts struggled to create significant opportunities until the last 15 minutes of the contest.Arsenal experienced relief when Havertz scored at 23 minutes, following their previous frustrating 0-0 draw against Everton at the Emirates.Havertz netted his 12th goal of the season by directing Leandro Trossard's low cross into the upper part of the goal. But Jesus's strike with a clever shot through Arijanet Muric's legs from a difficult position was ruled as offside.Despite their well-known effectiveness from set-pieces, Arsenal failed to capitalise on their corner opportunities.Gabriel Magalhaes missed a straightforward chance when his header struck the outside of the post from close range.Ipswich displayed increasing ambition in the latter half, which also provided Arsenal more opportunities to counter-attack.Havertz squandered an excellent opportunity to score his second goal, whilst Muric produced another save from Mikel Merino's effort, ensuring a tense conclusion.Ipswich continue to occupy the penultimate position in the table, with a three-point gap separating them from safety.","Arsenal defeated Ipswich 1-0 in their Premier League clash. Kai Havertz scored the only goal of the game in the 23rd minute. The result moves Arsenal to second in the table, six points behind Liverpool.

Tough Start for Ruud

NEW DELHI: Germany made a strong start on Sunday in defending their United Cup title, with world number two Alexander Zverev and Laura Siegemund securing victory over Brazil, eliminating the South Americans from the mixed-team tournament.Zverev sealed the win with a commanding 6-4, 6-4 performance against Thiago Monteiro, following Siegemund’s gritty 6-3, 1-6, 6-4 triumph over Beatriz Haddad Maia, who is ranked 17th, 63 places above her.The result in Perth knocked Brazil out of group play after an earlier defeat to China.Germany now faces China on Monday, with the winner advancing to the quarter-finals.In Sydney, women’s world number four Jasmine Paolini cruised past Belinda Bencic 6-1, 6-1 in just 57 minutes, ensuring Italy’s victory over Switzerland.Meanwhile, men’s world number six Casper Ruud endured a tough battle against Tomas Machac but couldn’t prevent Norway’s loss to the Czech Republic.Zverev set the tone against Monteiro by breaking serve in the opening game of each set, wrapping up the 80-minute contest without facing significant pressure. It marked an unusual position for Germany, who often relied on deciding mixed doubles matches in last year’s tournament.""This is the first time we've ever been up 2-0,"" Zverev said. ""Last year, I played deciding (mixed doubles) matches every time.""It's nice to have this (tie) in the bag.

She overpowered Bencic, who is making a comeback after maternity leave.""I played a really good match. Today everything worked really well,"" said Paolini.""I was serving and returning well, and I think that was the key.""Earlier, Flavio Cobolli defeated Dominic Stricker 6-3, 7-6 (6/2), giving Italy an initial lead.Meanwhile, Ruud, the highest-ranked Norwegian in history, faced a grueling match against Machac.

Machac and Muchova capitalized, defeating Viktor Durasovic and Ulrikke Eikeri 6-4, 6-4 to secure the Czech Republic’s win.""You kind of hope that it won't be that tough, but what a way to start the new season,"" said Ruud, who banked 2024 tournament wins at Geneva and Barcelona.""If every match is going to be this tough, it's going to be a tough (season).""Ruud’s concern may grow as he faced nine break points during the match, despite his early control in the third set.","World number two Alexander Zverev and Laura Siegemund secure victory over Brazil.

She anticipates playing on hard courts again.“Even though I got injured in Beijing, which was my last tournament, I feel pretty optimistic about how that match would have turned out (against Coco Gauff) and I am excited to play on hardcourt again.”Osaka has won the Australian Open twice (2019 and 2021) and the US Open twice (2018 and 2020). She affirmed her continued passion for tennis despite recent setbacks due to injuries.“I've been playing tennis since I was three, and a huge part of that I owe to my parents, but I never really saw my life doing anything else.”Osaka spoke about her lifelong involvement with tennis, attributing much of it to her parents' influence. She realized her deep love for the sport after exploring other possibilities.“Then, when I sat there and had the opportunity to do other things, I realized that I'd rather be playing tennis.”This realization reinforced her commitment to tennis.“So it was kind of one of those realization moments where you feel like you thought you were forced to do something, but in actuality you very much truly loved it.”Osaka's first-round opponent at the ASB Classic will be Lina Glushko of Israel.",Naomi Osaka is scheduled to compete in the ASB Classic in Auckland on Monday.

IPL retentions, releases and trades: The burning questions before deadline





Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) are facing criticism for their decision to retain fast-bowler Yash Dayal for IPL 2026. The franchise has kept him on their roster despite pending abuse allegations against him.RCB released six players before Saturday's deadline but chose to maintain Dayal's annual contract worth Rs 5 crore. This decision comes amid two ongoing criminal cases against the player.Dayal faces separate criminal cases in Ghaziabad and Jaipur, with FIRs filed in both cities. As a result, he has been banned from participating in his state's local competition, the Uttar Pradesh T20 League.The Ghaziabad case involves allegations from Dayal's former long-term partner. She accused him of sexual and financial exploitation under marriage promises, along with physical violence and mental harassment when she questioned his motives.The case was registered in July 2025 under Section 69 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). While police continue their investigation, the Allahabad High Court has granted Dayal interim protection from arrest.The Jaipur case presents more serious accusations. A woman alleged that Dayal repeatedly raped her over two years, starting when she was 17. She claimed he manipulated her with promises of helping her cricket career and assaulted her in a hotel during IPL events.Given the complainant's age at the time of the alleged incidents, the FIR includes sections from both the POCSO Act and the BNS.While teams are not legally required to release players facing criminal charges, sporting organisations typically avoid retaining athletes under investigation for serious crimes like rape and domestic assault.And thus, social media has erupted after noticing that RCB have continued to keep Dayal under their wing.RCB's complete squad for IPL 2026 includes Rajat Patidar as captain, along with Virat Kohli, Jitesh Sharma, Devdutt Padikkal, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Rasikh Salam, Suyash Sharma, Yash Dayal, Abhinandan Singh, Swapnil Singh, Tim David, Phil Salt, Jacob Bethell, Romario Shepherd, Josh Hazlewood, and Nuwan Thushara.The team's decision has sparked significant backlash on social media, with fans expressing their disappointment over the retention of Dayal despite the serious nature of allegations against him.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) are facing criticism for their decision to retain fast-bowler Yash Dayal for IPL 2026.

'Control your temptations': Jasprit Bumrah reacts after stunning fifer against South Africa in 1st Test

Poll How do you think Suryavanshi should handle high expectations as a young player? Ignore them and play his game Use them as motivation to improve Convey them to his parents for support





A recently released video on the BCCI website has offered fans a closer, more personal glimpse into Vaibhav Suryavanshi’s life away from the field, highlighting the teenager’s grounded approach despite a record-breaking performance in India A’s opening match of the ACC Men’s Asia Cup Rising Stars 2025.The clip captures a video call between Suryavanshi and his father, Sanjeev Suryavanshi, shortly after India A’s win over the UAE. The conversation begins with a simple greeting, followed by his father mentioning that he had been watching the match from the start. What stood out was the light-hearted yet immediate shift from admiration to analysis of his game.Suryavanshi's father offered a piece of technical advice, telling his son, “Had you played that shot a bit higher over the covers, it could’ve been a six.”Suryavanshi responded with a smile, saying, “Couldn’t connect properly, the ball was slower.”His father then congratulated him for the innings, after which Suryavanshi explained the contrasting ways his parents react to his performances.“Dad is not easily impressed. Even if I had scored 200 today, he would still feel like I could have scored more,” he said.He added that his mother responds differently, saying, “Even if I score a 100 or 0, she is always happy and tells me to keep doing well.”Despite his 32-ball century and a stunning 144 off 42 balls in an an innings featuring 15 sixes and 11 fours, Suryavanshi spoke with restraint about his own role.“I don’t try to do anything extraordinary. I just back my game and work hard. If I try something too different, it will neither help myself or the team,” he said.Reflecting briefly on the innings, he added, “If I had batted a little longer, we could have added 20-30 runs more and it could have been some sort of a personal record too.”The match itself was dominated by his explosive batting, which propelled India A to 297/4, with captain Jitesh Sharma contributing a quickfire half-century.Last season, Suryavanshi had made headlines in the IPL with one of the fastest hundreds in the tournament’s history, and the campaign concluded with him emerging as one of the breakout performers.Looking ahead, he said that the focus remains on starting well in the competition and contributing regardless of the opponent.The video, however, offered a reminder that behind the exceptional numbers is a young player who balances high expectations in the public eye and backed constant encouragement at home.","Vaibhav Suryavanshi scored a record-breaking 144 off 42 balls in India A's opening match of the ACC Men’s Asia Cup Rising Stars 2025.

'We need to determine how he got it': Morne Morkel on Shubman Gill's injury & pitch quality at Eden Gardens





Kolkata: Shubman Gill went low for a sweep against South Africa’s off-break bowler Simon Harmer . He connected beautifully and the ball raced to the boundary. He stood up with a satisfied look but suddenly froze, reached out for the nape of his neck and grimaced. Soon, he was seen walking out of the field with the physio. Gill did not return to the ground on Saturday and Rishabh Pant captained the side during South Africa’s second innings.It will be difficult to determine whether Gill’s discomfort is a result of his immense workload across formats or just an accidental injury, like a neck spasm you might experience after waking up. The flamboyant sweep off Harmer could have exacerbated the stiffness he was carrying, but is there a deeper issue?The Indian cricket board (BCCI) is taking no chances and the skipper was said to have been taken for a precautionary scan, although an official statement will be released only on Sunday.“We first need to determine how he got the neck stiffness, maybe just a bad night’s sleep,” Morkel said. “I don’t think you can put it down to Shubman’s workload. He looks after himself very well and it is quite unfortunate that he woke up this morning with a stiff neck and that carried on for the entire day. It’s just bad timing for us.”Earlier, while warming up before the day’s play, the India skipper was seen repeatedly feeling the nape of his neck and even having a chat with the physio while slowly massaging the area.Gill, who plays in all formats, has been extremely busy since the Asia Cup. “I’m trying to figure out how to manage the workload,” he said on the eve of the Eden Test.","Shubman Gill went low for a sweep against South Africa’s off-break bowler Simon Harmer.

Kolkata: This is turning out to be a bowler’s paradise, thanks to the pitch. By stumps on Saturday, the second day of the first India–South Africa Test at the Eden Gardens here, 26 wickets had fallen in six sessions.Given the wicked variable bounce on offer, batters were often left wondering whether they should come forward or stay back. If one stayed low, the next one rose sharply. This is clearly not the kind of wicket where runs can flow freely and where survival instincts have to be at their best. It showed in the scores.India, chasing South Africa’s first-innings score of 159, managed 189 without skipper Shubman Gill , who had to retire hurt with a neck spasm after facing just three balls. He did not come back for the rest of the day. In a low-scoring match, even a small lead can be the decisive factor, and India’s 30-run advantage gave them the edge.When South Africa came in to bat for the second time, erasing this lead would have been top of their agenda. They did go past it in due time, losing both their openers in the process to India’s spinners.That milestone was hardly noticed as South Africa continued their edgy quest to merely survive, an exercise severely dented by Ravindra Jadeja , with help from the team’s other spinners. Jadeja made the red ball bite as South Africa’s vulnerability to spin was left exposed.Jadeja so far has four scalps in South Africa’s 93/7, with Temba Bavuma holding one end up at 29. The one that got Tristan Stubbs perhaps best exemplifies South African batters’ confusion. Jadeja had one land on middle stump, move out just enough to hit the off stump, and Stubbs was left wondering what had happened. Wily Jadeja had delivered another masterful display.Gill’s retirement proved crucial for India on a wicket that was never easy to bat on. With the South African bowlers getting as much purchase as the Indians did, Gill’s technique would have been paramount. In fact, the sweep he played, which resulted in the neck spasm flaring up, was picture-perfect.With his departure, India were effectively 3/79, having lost Washington Sundar a little earlier. The onus fell on KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant to repair the innings. Although Rahul was cautious, waiting for the right ball, Pant batted like there was no tomorrow. Clearly, Rahul’s scalp had to be earned, while Pant was always in danger of gifting away his wicket.It needed a great catch from Aiden Markram at slips to send back Rahul after a patient, well-grafted 39. Pant could have avoided going for a pull off Corbin Bosch given the circumstances, and only managed to balloon an easy catch to wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne. His 24-ball 27 would have looked good in a T20 match, but in a Test match, where staying put was the order of the day, Pant’s talent was perhaps wasted.South Africa off-break bowler Simon Harmer troubled India, who are playing with six left-handers, the most. The left-handers were finding him difficult to read. On top of that was the inconsistency in bounce.Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel are good on batting wickets, but on surfaces where a lot of unknowns seem to be lurking, they are not the best choices to pull the team out of a rut. Both contributed, but not enough to put India in a commanding position. Now it’s about Bavuma’s grit against India’s relentless spin attack.","26 wickets had fallen in six sessions on the second day of the first India–South Africa Test at the Eden Gardens.

With the IPL 2026 mini auction just a few weeks away, all ten franchises have confirmed their updated squads, marking out who has been retained and who has been released.

Here’s a reworked look at the purse remaining for every side, listed from the biggest spenders to those entering the auction with bare pockets.Kolkata Knight Riders will walk into the IPL 2026 mini auction with the largest purse of all, a massive Rs 64.3 crore in hand. A refreshed support group led by head coach Abhishek Nayar, with Shane Watson and Tim Southee alongside, faces the major task of reshaping the squad ahead of the new season.Chennai Super Kings have the second-biggest budget to work with at Rs 43.4 crore.

SPIN FRIENDLY





HUBBALLI: Karnataka will be eyeing a win as they meet struggling Chandigarh in their last Ranji Trophy league engagement before the break for the white-ball competitions.The Mayank Agarwal-led side, with 14 points from four matches so far, is currently placed second in Group B behind Madhya Pradesh (15).Karnataka began their campaign by conceding a first-innings lead to Saurashtra, before securing three points from their drawn match against Goa. They then defeated Kerala by an innings-and-164 runs, before picking up three points by virtue of a first-innings lead in their drawn engagement with Maharashtra. Hence, consistency will be on their minds.Karun Nair, who returned to the Karnataka fold this season after a two-year hiatus, is their leading run-getter with 507 runs, including a double ton and a century — well ahead of his teammates. However, in the match against Maharashtra in Pune last week, the 33-year-old could manage only 4 and 15.Against Chandigarh, who are at the bottom of the table with three defeats, Karun will look to regain his form.After totalling just 99 in four innings, skipper Agarwal struck form in Pune with scores of 80 and 103. K V Aneesh, who replaced Nikin Jose as Agarwal’s opening partner after two games, will be looking to come good with the bat after totalling just 34 in three innings.R Smaran, whose potential is highly spoken of in the domestic circuit, struck an unbeaten 220 against Kerala and half-centuries against Saurashtra (77) and Maharashtra (54), but needs to build on the starts more consistently.The same applies to wicketkeeper-batter K L Shrijith as well.The brightest spark for Karnataka this season is all-rounder Shreyas Gopal . Apart from claiming 17 wickets in four matches, the 32-year-old has delivered under pressure with the bat. With 227 runs thus far, he has been a vital cog in the middle order.Although there is a healthy coat of grass on the surface at the KSCA Stadium here, the blazing sun could favour spinners from Day 2. In such a scenario, the hosts would be tempted to play two specialist pacers -Vidwath Kaverappa and Abhilash Shetty and field three spinners, with Mohsin Khan and Shikhar Shetty joining leggie Shreyas.In a season where heavy defeats have been the order for them, Chandigarh will take positives from the form of 24-year-old Arjun Azad, who is their leading run-getter with 394. Apart from Azad, the only other batter to put some decent runs on the board has been Ankit Kaushik.The visitors will look forward to their seasoned skipper Manan Vohra to lead from the front.The surface could help the Chandigarh bowling attack, led by Vishnu Kashyap and Nishunk Birla, with spin being the visitors’ strength.","The Mayank Agarwal-led side, with 14 points from four matches so far, is currently placed second in Group B behind Madhya Pradesh (15) Karun Nair is their leading run-getter with 507 runs, including a double ton and a century.

'We need to determine how he got it': Morne Morkel on Shubman Gill's injury & pitch quality at Eden Gardens





NEW DELHI: India bowling coach Morne Morkel acknowledged that the team was ""surprised"" by how quickly the Eden Gardens pitch ""deteriorated"" after a dramatic second day that saw 15 wickets fall and the opening Test tilt strongly in India’s favour.Resuming at 37 for 1, India were bowled out for 189, but Ravindra Jadeja (4/29) and Kuldeep Yadav (2/12) put South Africa under severe pressure at 93 for 7, with only captain Temba Bavuma (29 off 78) showing resistance as the visitors held a slender lead of 63 runs.Morkel admitted the team did not anticipate such rapid wear and tear.""Yeah, look, I mean, to be honest with you, even we didn't expect a wicket to deteriorate so quickly... we all thought when we watched that first couple of hours that it was a good wicket, so it did deteriorate quite quickly, which was unexpected,"" he said after stumps.He added that such unpredictability is what makes playing in India demanding.""That's the beauty sometimes of playing in the subcontinent... you need to be able to adapt and react to conditions quite quickly and that's the sort of challenge that we're facing here at the moment.""Despite the surface behaviour, Morkel emphasised that India had backed their strengths.“We've got quality with seam and spin... we cover both bases. For us it's just a matter of what is in front of us and to play that as best as possible.”He said the pre-match conversation had labelled the pitch as “a good wicket,” with the focus instead on attacking South Africa’s batting.“The conversation leading up to the game was that it's going to be a good wicket and it's going to be hard work... so we planned more on how we were going to attack and target the South African batting line-up. We took the thought of the conditions out of the equation.”The plan, he said, was to adjust session by session.“We thought it was going to deteriorate as the match goes on... we would adapt on the day and play it session by session.”Pointing to Bavuma’s composure, Morkel said runs were still gettable.“Temba showed tonight that it is battable if you can rotate strike and have a solid game plan.”He noted that batting would require surviving difficult spells.“I thought this morning it was going to be a surface where it's tough to score in stages, but then over two or three overs you can get a couple of runs. It's just about fighting through those little tough periods.”KL Rahul’s 39 remains the top score in the match, and Morkel said there is no single method that will work on this surface.“I don't think there's a set format where you just survive. You need to transfer a bit of pressure onto the bowler, look to rotate strike and be busy at the crease,” he said.“Everybody’s got different strength... it’s up to the batter to work out his best way of scoring whether to be attacking, sweep, or just rotate strike.”He felt India finished below par in the first innings.“We all agree we could have scored 50-60 more... rotating strike is tricky. Unfortunately, Shubman going down early (retiring hurt) meant another new batter at the crease.”With Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant both taking charge over the course of the innings, Morkel said leadership remains a collective effort.""From the outside it's calmer... we can throw out suggestions on how we think we can squeeze more or take wickets. At the end of the day, we win together, lose together and plan together,"" he said.""Everybody’s got their way... there’s never a wrong or right way. You reflect after the game, look to get better and find your path to a win.""Even with the pitch surprising both sides, India’s selection — four spinners with Sai Sudharsan omitted for Axar Patel — suggested a better read of the conditions. But Morkel insisted this won’t become a set pattern.""We'll take it Test by Test... pick the best XI that we feel can get the win. Not looking too far ahead. Play this game well, take learnings, then arrive in Guwahati and see what we get,"" he added.","India bowling coach Morne Morkel says the team was ""surprised"" by how quickly the Eden Gardens pitch ""deteriorated"" after a dramatic second day.

'We need to determine how he got it': Morne Morkel on Shubman Gill's injury & pitch quality at Eden Gardens





India Test captain Shubman Gill was taken to a hospital in Kolkata after there was no relief from the neck pain. It is understood that Gill had a neck brace on when he left the Eden Gardens with the Indian cricket team’s doctor. The 26-year-old was in considerable pain and underwent scans and routine assessment at the medical facility. His vitals are in order at the moment, and the BCCI medical team is waiting for reports to decide the future course of action.The youngster will stay under observation overnight.Gill lasted just three deliveries in the middle, as he experienced severe pain moments after hitting a boundary and was immediately off the field. The Indian cricket board confirmed that he had a neck spasm.While walking back to the change room, the right-hander kept rubbing the back of his neck. All stakeholders are currently focused on the cricketer’s well-being, and there are no discussions around him taking the field at the moment.At the end of the day’s play, India bowling coach Morne Morkel revealed that India’s No. 4 woke up with a “stiff neck” and downplayed the workload chatter.“Gill is a very fit guy, he looks after himself very well, so it’s just unfortunate this morning that he woke up with a stiff neck and that carried him into the day, which was crucial for us,” said Morkel.“Another sort of partnership with him batting around was going to be needed for us at the time and... just bad timing,” he further added.Gill’s father is in Kolkata for the Test match and is by the Indian captain’s side.","India Test captain Shubman Gill was taken to a hospital in Kolkata after there was no relief from the neck pain.

Poll Do you think the pitch at Eden Gardens was suitable for Test cricket? Yes, it's part of the game. No, it was unplayable.





The surface at Eden Gardens once again became the centre of conversation, overshadowing the cricket on display during the first India–South Africa Test.With the match racing towards an early finish by the second evening, the pitch a lot of criticism from former and current cricketers, turning the focus away from the contest itself.South Africa were blown away for 159 in their first innings, and India managed only a slender 30-run lead in reply. By Stumps on Day 2, the visitors were struggling at 93 for 7, and their their advantage was a minor 63-run lead.Pacers controlled the first session of the Test, while spinners took control afterwards, sharing 12 of the 17 wickets to fall across two innings as the pitch continued to offer unpredictable bounce and exaggerated turn.Harbhajan Singh was among those who sharply expressed his displeasure with the surface. Writing on X, the former India off-spinner said the match had made the longest format unrecognisable.“Test cricket india vs South Africa the game almost over on 2nd day isn’t finished yet . What a mockery of test cricket #RIPTESTCRICKET,” Harbhajan posted. Michael Vaughan joined the discussion with a blunt assessment, calling it an “Awful pitch in Kolkata … #INDvSA.”Australian former captain Aaron Finch also weighed in, but with a slightly different perspective. He invited his followers to share their views on the turning track, adding that he enjoys the challenge posed by such surfaces.“What are your thoughts on the type of wicket we are seeing in kolkata? I love seeing fielders crowding the bat and the ball spinning big, makes for great viewing,” Finch wrote.Ravichandran Ashwin responded by defending the nature of the pitch and pointing instead to batting technique. He highlighted Temba Bavuma’s patient unbeaten stay as an example.“Hey Finchy, Bavuma clearly showed that this pitch was manageable with his sound defensive technique… not picking length as a batter is recipe for disaster,” Ashwin said.As the Test moves to its final phase, the debate over the surface is likely to continue, with the spotlight firmly fixed on how conditions shaped the match rather than the cricket alone.","The pitch at Eden Gardens in Kolkata has been at the center of discussion, but for the wrong reasons.

‘Thakur a selfless captain’



Rahane to miss clash due to 'back spasms'



Poll Do you think Sarfaraz Khan will bounce back and score a century this season? Yes, definitely! No, I doubt it. He might score a fifty, but not a century.





: This is turning out to be an indifferent season for Sarfaraz Khan . For a man who has scored 16 hundreds in first-class cricket and boasts of an average of 63.10 and a run tally of 4796 runs in 59 matches, the 28-year-old is yet to cross fifty so far in this Ranji Trophy season, having made severely underwhelming scores of 42, 32, 1, 15, 5 not out & 16 in four matches. Overall, Mumbai’s domestic run-machine has scored just 111 runs in four matches at the rate of 22.20 this season.In contrast, Sarfaraz’s teammate Siddhesh Lad, with 360 runs in four matches, at a 72.00 strike rate, including two hundreds (127 in this match) and a fifty, is the top run-getter for Mumbai so far. Sarfaraz’s younger brother Musheer Khan has made scores of 112, 49 & 63 in his three innings.However, the batter doesn’t seem flustered by his rare average run in domestic cricket.“You can’t score runs in every match. I scored so many runs in the last four seasons. Sometimes, you go through a period when you lose your wicket despite playing well. Everyone in our team is scoring runs and taking wickets, doing well. The important thing is that we’ve to win the Ranji Trophy,” Sarfaraz told reporters at the Wankhede Stadium here on Saturday, a day before Mumbai take on Pondicherry at the venue in an Elite Group D clash.Is he frustrated due to lack of runs of late? “I’m not frustrated at all. If you see my record, I’ve scored a lot of runs. People enjoy a 1000-run season once in four years..in the last four-five yearsrun(I’ve scored plenty of runs in the last four-five years.) It’s just that I haven’t scored too many runs in two-three matches. That doesn’t make a difference,” Sarfaraz said.Exuding confidence in his playing style, Sarfaraz said, “I don’t think that I need to change anything (in my batting), because I’m doing good. I’m just trying to do what I’ve always done-practice hard.”Sarfarz was all praise for Mumbai’s captain this season, India all-rounder Shardul Thakur, who he felt “keeps team before himself,” a quality the batter said marks the pacer out from the other Mumbai captains he has played under.“We’ve a very good captain. Shardul bhai is doing a great job. I’m very happy that Mumbai has got a captain like Shardul, who is selfless and keeps the team before himself. If he notices that a wicket isn’t helpful for the pacers, he wouldn’t insist on bowling himself, since he’s the captain, or he too has to look after his career. He doesn’t think like that at all. He prioritises the Mumbai team over his personal goals. I’ve been playing in the Ranji Trophy for the past 10-12 seasons now, and have played under a lot of captains, but I’ve noticed that difference in him: He prioritises Mumbai cricket over himself. ”“At the back of your mind, you want to take more opportunities, do well and play at a higher level. However, Shardul doesn’t think like that. The Mumbai team comes first for him,” the batter complimented.Illustrating his point about Thakur, Sarfaraz said, “If you notice, he has batted as low as No 8 or No 9 this season. After bowling just two overs, he takes himself off the attack because he knows that it isn’t a wicket conducive for the fast bowlers. It shows that there’s just one thing in his mind: ‘How to win the Ranji Trophy.’ I’m enjoying playing under such a captain.”Opening up on the bonding in the Mumbai team, Sarfaraz said, “I wasn’t playing for Mumbai in the past two years as I was in the Indian team. Our team is very united. We train together. Even we play in Mumbai, we stay in a hotel together, rather than in our homes.”Sarfaraz seemed excited by the fact that Mumbai will playing at the Wankhede for the first time in 19 months-they last turned out at the Wankhede in the Ranji Trophy final against Vidarbha in March 2024, which they won by 169 runs to clinch their 42nd title. Since the last two seasons, Mumbai have preferred to play on the turning track at the MCA ground in BKC.“We are playing at the Wankhede after a long time, so I’m feeling good. It’s a nice green top wicket, and we’ll be playing on such a pitch after a long time. Our team is playing very well. We have accumulated 17 points in four matches, and scored outright wins in two games (over Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal). We plan to continue this momentum,” Sarfaraz said.Two of Pondicherry’s players-their captain-cum-coach-cum mentor, veteran left-arm spinner Sagar Udeshi, who plays for Parsee Gymkhana in local cricket, and batter Aman Khan, are former Mumbai cricketers. “We’ve played a lot against each other and we know each other well. I’ve practiced against Udeshi at Azad maidan and at Fort Vijay,” Sarfaraz said.Meanwhile, former captain Ajinkya Rahane will miss the clash against Pondicherry due to a back niggle, TOI has learnt. ""Rahane is resting from this match as he is suffering from back spasms. In fact, his back was stiff during the previous match too,"" a source revealed.Rahane is likely to be replaced at the No 3 spot by opener Akhil Herwadkar. Rahane has scored 209 runs in four matches at a 34.83 strike rate in the 2025-26 edition of the Ranji Trophy so far, with 159 against Chhattisgarh being his highest score. The 31-year-old Herwadkar has scored 2483 runs in 41 first-class maches at the rate of 36.51, with seven hundreds and 10 fifties. The left-hander played for Chhattisgarh in the 2022-23 season, before moving back to Mumbai.With 17 points in four matches, Mumbai are topping the eight-team Group D. They thrashed Himachal by an innings & 120 runs in their last match at the MCA ground in BKC last week.","Sarfaraz Khan has made scores of 42, 32, 1, 15, 5 not out & 16 in four matches.

AHMEDABAD: India’s age-level footballers need to play more competitive games to be able to challenge strong Asian footballing countries like Japan, said U-17 boys’ coach Bibiano Fernandes.“We need competition, and the competition is tough. Games competition improves players. So, a U-19 footballer from Japan plays 600 matches, while a U-19 footballer from India has played only 200 competitive matches. So, if we can cover up those games and get close to where Japanese players are, like at least 500 competitive matches by 19, then we can match in Asia,” Fernandes said ahead of the U-17 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers here next week.The U-17 team is here from Nov 1 as prep for the AFC U-17 Asian Cup qualifiers. Hosts India are clubbed with Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, and Chinese Taipei, and begin against Palestine on Nov 22, before taking on Chinese Taipei on Nov 26. The hosts then take on Lebanon on Nov 28, before a final clash against Iran.","India’s age-level footballers need to play more competitive games to be able to challenge strong Asian footballing countries like Japan, says U-17 boys’ coach Bibiano Fernandes. “We need competition, and the competition is tough.

Ronaldo Drops STUNNING Trump Claim in New Interview: What He REALLY Said | WATCH





France have secured their spot in the 2026 World Cup, with Kylian Mbappé leading the charge. Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo faces a potential ban from Portugal's opening match if his team manages to win their European qualifying group.France achieved qualification with a convincing 4-0 victory against Ukraine at home, highlighted by Mbappé's double contribution. Portugal's path hit a roadblock after a surprising 2-0 defeat to Ireland in Dublin, where Ronaldo received his first-ever international red card.The French dominance continued in the second half as Michael Olise and substitute Hugo Ekitiké added to the scoresheet.At Parc des Princes in Paris, Mbappé opened the scoring with a penalty in the 55th minute. Olise extended the lead with a curling shot in the 76th minute, followed by Mbappé's close-range finish in the 83rd. This brought Mbappé's international goal tally to 55, just two behind Olivier Giroud's national record.""The French national team will always be better with him in it. He makes things easier for us. He performed his role perfectly this evening, as both a player and the captain of the national team,"" said coach Didier Deschamps about Mbappé.Mbappé nearly completed his hat-trick but missed a clear opportunity shortly after his second goal.France lead Group D with 13 points, while Ukraine and Iceland share seven points each, setting up a crucial match for second place on Sunday.Portugal's situation became complicated when Ronaldo received a red card for elbowing Ireland's Dara O'Shea after an hour of play. The initial yellow card was upgraded to red following a video review.""I thought it was a bit harsh. He has never been sent off before in 226 games,"" Portugal coach Roberto Martinez commented on the incident.Ronaldo will miss Portugal's match against Armenia due to the mandatory one-game suspension. FIFA rules may extend this to at least two matches for serious foul play.Ireland's victory came through Troy Parrott's two goals.

Poll Should the ISL, I-League, and I-League 2 be managed under one commercial framework? Yes, it will promote parity No, each league should have its own management

Amid the ongoing turmoil in Indian football, Union Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya met representatives of I-League clubs in New Delhi on Thursday to discuss their concerns and explore possible solutions to the escalating standoff between the All India Football Federation (AIFF), the Indian Super League (ISL), and I-League teams.The meeting, attended by seven representatives from among the 14 I-League clubs, was also joined by Sports Secretary and SAI Director General Hari Ranjan Rao and Joint Secretary Kunal. According to a senior official present, Mandaviya “gave a patient hearing to the I-League representatives” and urged the Sports Authority of India to mediate discussions going forward for the time being.“The minister gave a patient hearing to the I-League representatives and for the time being instructed SAI to step in and engage with the stakeholders.He wants a constructive dialogue between officials of the AIFF, the Indian Super League (ISL) and I-League,” a source told PTI.The intervention from the ministry comes a day after I-League clubs boycotted a meeting convened by the AIFF to address the deepening crisis triggered by the federation’s inability to secure a new commercial partner.The fallout of the AIFF’s failed renewal with Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), which had managed the ISL and related commercial activities, has left domestic football in uncertainty.With the partnership collapsing ahead of its December expiry, the 2025–26 ISL season remains on hold, and top I-League clubs, including defending champions Mohun Bagan, have suspended training sessions.The I-League clubs have demanded that all tiers of Indian football, namely the ISL, I-League, and I-League 2 be managed under a single commercial framework to ensure parity and stability.The AIFF’s search for a new partner is being monitored by the Supreme Court, which approved a revised constitution for the federation in October.The ministry is expected to facilitate further discussions between the AIFF, ISL and I-League representatives in the coming days to help break the deadlock.","Union Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya met representatives of I-League clubs in New Delhi on Thursday.

Poll Should Oscar consider retiring to prioritize his health? Yes, absolutely No, he should continue playing if possible





Former Chelsea and Brazil midfielder Oscar was taken to hospital after suffering a heart-related issue during a pre-season training session with São Paulo. The club confirmed that the 34-year-old is in stable condition and under medical observation.According to reports in Brazil, the incident occurred during fitness tests on an exercise bike when Oscar collapsed and briefly lost consciousness. He was attended to immediately by medical staff before being transported to hospital in an ambulance.São Paulo released an official statement confirming the episode and the player’s current status. “During tests carried out on Tuesday morning, at SuperCT, as part of pre-season preparation, athlete Oscar presented a complication with cardiac changes, and was promptly treated by the club's professionals and the medical team from Einstein Hospital Israelita, who were present at the scene,” the club said.It further added: “The player was then taken to the hospital, where he is clinically stable and remains under observation for further tests to clarify the diagnosis.”Oscar, who returned to his boyhood club São Paulo on a free transfer last December, has a contract with the team until 2027. He had spent several years playing in China before his return to Brazil.The midfielder was a key figure at Chelsea between 2012 and 2017, winning two Premier League titles and a Europa League crown during his time in England.He left the London club midway through the 2016–17 season to join Shanghai for a reported $73 million fee, becoming one of the highest-paid players in the Chinese Super League.Oscar also represented Brazil at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, playing alongside Neymar Jr, scoring the team’s only goal in the 7–1 semifinal thrashing to eventual champions Germany.Further medical updates on his condition are expected as São Paulo continue to monitor the midfielder closely.There are also reports that the player is considering retirement after his condition came to light. In 2021, Argentina's Sergio Aguero called time on his career after heart related issues after joining Barcelona on a free transfer from Manchester City.","Oscar was taken to hospital after suffering a heart-related issue during a pre- season training session with São Paulo.

Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has urged Ireland fans to boo him when Portugal take the field in Thursday’s World Cup qualifier in Dublin. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, the 40-year-old said he hoped the home supporters’ focus on him might ease the pressure on his teammates as Portugal look to secure qualification for the 2026 World Cup.“The stadium will boo me, I’m used to it, I certainly hope they do — maybe it will take the pressure off other players,” Ronaldo told reporters in Dublin. Portugal sit five points clear at the top of Group F with two games left, and a win over Ireland would seal their spot in next year’s World Cup. Ronaldo, who is aiming to feature in his sixth edition of the tournament, said he expects a tough contest against an Irish side that will likely defend deep.“It will be a difficult match,” he said. “Ireland will sit back and make it hard for us to find space.”The Al Nassr forward was also asked about the possibility of scoring his 1000th career goal in the World Cup final, which he dismissed with a laugh. “You’ve been watching too many movies, that would be too perfect,” Ronaldo joked. “It’s always good to score goals — that’s my job. I want to play in this next World Cup, otherwise I wouldn’t be here, but let’s take it step by step.”Ronaldo has scored 953 career goals and holds the record for the most goals in men’s international football with 143. While he hinted earlier this week that the 2026 World Cup could be his last, Ronaldo chose not to dwell on his future this time.“There’s no point in being repetitive and losing focus,” he said. “Maybe later I’ll speak more clearly about what I think for the future, but right now, the goal is qualification.”","Cristiano Ronaldo has urged Ireland fans to boo him when Portugal take the field in Thursday's World Cup qualifier in Dublin.

It was a busy day at the Football House in New Delhi as the All India Football Federation (AIFF) convened back-to-back meetings with multiple stakeholders in order to address the current predicament facing Indian football.AIFF called for interactions on short notice with Executive Committee members, Indian Super League (ISL) captains, club CEOs and I-League owners on Wednesday (November 12). ISL clubs and captains - except that of Mohun Bagan Super Giant and East Bengal - explored the possibility of putting in all their resources to make the top-tier tournament happen.Eight I-League clubs, meanwhile, stayed away from the meeting and are due to meet Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Thursday.“Keeping in mind the fundamental importance of a multi- tier league National structure for the development of the football in the country (Tier 1-2-3), we suggest that all the three leagues in this case ISL, I League and I League-2 should be managed by one common league partner. This shall ensure long term holistic growth and sustainability to the National league ecosystem of the country,” the I-League clubs reportedly wrote to AIFF deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan.I-League clubs gave AIFF the ultimatum of announcing the new season in the next 10 days with kick-off by December 15 and not later than January 5, 2026 with matches to be broadcast live on two of the biggest properties - Star Sports and JioHotstar; Sony Sports Network and SonyLiv.AIFF had asked for all the stakeholders to join in consecutive meetings on less than three-hour notice. The desperate move was necessitated by the impending Supreme Court hearing where Chairperson of the Bid Evaluation Committee, Justice (Retd.) L.

When the football federation put the tender publicly, four bidders showed initial interest, before pulling out as request for proposal (RFP) wasn't considered to be ""commercially viable.""Meanwhile, with the season in serious threat and their livelihoods on the line, the players came together as one.“To put it simply,” said the players in a statement that was later shared on social media, “we want to play, and now.”“This is a plea to all those involved in running our sport in the country, to do whatever it takes to get the football season underway,” the statement read.“India needs its competitive football now more than ever. As for us, we remain committed, professional and ready to walk out of that tunnel and onto the pitch the moment we're told we can. All we ask of those running our beautiful game, to match our desperation with honest intent. We've found ourselves in a very dark tunnel for long. We could do with a little light.”The statement was shared by some of Indian football's biggest names - Sunil Chhetri, Sandesh Jhingan, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, Rahul Bheke, Lallianzuala Chhangte. The foreign players, too, followed suit.","Three of India's top football clubs have halted operations amid uncertainty over the future of the sport in the country.

Justin Tucker faces uncertain NFL return after serving suspension

Justin Tucker’s name is back in NFL conversations, but not because of a game-winning kick. The former Baltimore Ravens star has completed his 10-game suspension and is finally eligible to return. Now the league waits to see if any team is willing to sign him after months of headlines, allegations and intense scrutiny. His return window is open, yet his future remains uncertain as front offices weigh talent against controversy.Tucker, once viewed as one of the most reliable kickers in football, is now trying to rebuild his career at a time when several teams are desperate for stability. He has served his full punishment under the NFL’s personal conduct policy, and his reinstatement clears the path for a comeback. Whether that comeback actually happens will depend on who is willing to take the risk.Justin Tucker can return to the field if he signs with a team. His 10-game suspension for violating the NFL’s personal conduct policy is complete, and he is now free to join any roster. The Ravens released him in May after allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced. Sixteen Baltimore-area massage therapists accused him of inappropriate behavior between 2012 and 2016.As the claims spread, Tucker and his wife, Amanda, denied the accusations. He said, “It devastates me to know that anyone I have worked with would not have felt respected. To anyone who has felt otherwise, I am sorry.”The NFL launched its own investigation and suspended him in June. He served the suspension as a free agent, officially becoming eligible to return on Nov. 11. Despite the controversy, NFL Network reported earlier that he had interest from several teams.Tucker’s resume is still impressive. He is a seven-time Pro Bowler and five-time All-Pro with an 89.1 percent career accuracy rate, ranking him among the best kickers in league history. He also set the 66-yard field goal record in 2021 before it was topped this season. But his final year in Baltimore raised concerns. He hit just 73.3 percent of his attempts and went 6 of 11 from 50 yards or more.Teams like the Rams, Falcons and Packers have struggled with consistency this season, making Tucker a possible option despite the backlash that may follow. As the playoff push intensifies, reliability becomes priceless. That might give Tucker the opening he needs, even if the decision comes with consequences for whichever team signs him.",Justin Tucker can return to the field if he signs with a team.

Antonio Brown’s possible future now looks far more serious than most expected. What many believed was a 15-year maximum sentence linked to a second-degree attempted murder charge in Miami has now expanded into something much heavier. As new legal details continue to surface, the former NFL star faces a scenario that could reshape the rest of his life. The realities of Florida law, especially the strict rules tied to violent offenses involving firearms, now place him at the edge of decades behind bars. With his arraignment set for Monday, the true weight of the case is beginning to settle in.A legal source familiar with Florida’s criminal procedures has confirmed that Brown could receive up to 30 years in prison, with a mandatory minimum of 20. This development shifts the conversation around his situation, raising questions about how the case reached this point and what may unfold next. The charge moves into steeper territory because prosecutors allege he discharged a firearm, which activates Florida’s “10-20-Life” law and elevates the punishment to the level of a first-degree felony.The key factor is the accusation that Brown fired a gun during the confrontation at a celebrity boxing event in Miami in May 2025.According to investigators, the encounter escalated quickly after Brown allegedly struck a man, grabbed a firearm from a security guard, and ran after the victim before firing two shots. Newly obtained video cited by The Washington Post reportedly shows Brown sprinting toward the man moments before the gun was fired. The victim later told authorities that the bullets grazed his neck during the struggle.After the incident, Brown left the scene and soon slipped out of the country. He later appeared in Dubai, where he continued to post online as Miami authorities searched for him. Earlier this month, officials located him, arrested him, and brought him back to the United States to face the charges.This week, Brown pleaded not guilty and was placed on house arrest while he waits for trial. Monday’s arraignment is expected to highlight the full scope of what he faces. For a player once known for his athletic talent, the path ahead now appears far more uncertain, with the possibility of a decades-long sentence shaping his future.",Antonio Brown's possible future now looks far more serious than most expected.

Kayla Nicole seems to never escape the storm that follows her name online. The former longtime girlfriend of Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce is once again pulled into a new wave of backlash, and this time the conversation is not only about what she said years ago. It is also about how she chose to respond now. What began as a resurfacing of decade-old tweets has turned into a much louder debate about authenticity, accountability, and the growing suspicion around the use of artificial intelligence in public apologies.The SportsRush reported that some online users accused Nicole of using ChatGPT or another AI tool to craft her apology for her old offensive tweets. That accusation has created a second controversy, with people now questioning whether her regret was genuine or written by a machine.The situation first ignited when users dug up tweets Nicole posted between 2010 and 2014, long before she became a public figure. Those posts contained racial remarks, homophobic language, and stereotypes aimed at Asian and Indian communities. As screenshots began circulating at high speed across social media, Nicole took down her X account and later addressed the issue on Instagram. In her statement, she wrote that she was ""ashamed"" of her past language and stressed that her current beliefs ""are rooted in love, respect, and empathy.Her apology was expected to settle the matter, but instead it sparked more frustration. Some users copied her message into online AI-detection tools, which labeled it as “100% AI-generated.” According to The SportsRush, this result encouraged critics to argue that Nicole relied on ChatGPT to form her apology. The allegation quickly became louder than the apology itself as many claimed the tone felt calculated rather than heartfelt.For some people, the possibility of an AI-written apology suggested that she did not hold true remorse. They viewed it as an attempt to escape accountability through polished language.Others pushed back, saying that AI accusations felt like an unnecessary distraction. They argued that using detection tools to delegitimize her apology only added noise to an already tense situation. Instead, they believe that the focus should remain on acknowledging harm, understanding growth, and recognizing that people can evolve from the mistakes they made in their past.","Travis Kelce’s ex faces new scrutiny as fans claim her heartfelt apology shows signs of AI-generated scripting.

Swifties think Taylor Swift’s ‘The Fate of Ophelia’ is aimed directly at Joe Alwyn

More coverage on NFL:





Taylor Swift’s latest track, “The Fate of Ophelia,” is sparking a fresh wave of online theories and Swifties are convinced she’s weaving real-life heartbreak into a Shakespeare-inspired narrative. The song, featured on The Life of a Showgirl, flips the tragic Ophelia storyline into one of revival, and fans immediately tie the imagery to Taylor’s emotional journey after her six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn.With lyrics that feel pointed, timing that feels deliberate, and symbolism that leans heavily into themes of rescue, rebirth, and choosing a new path, this track has become the latest cultural flashpoint as listeners dissect what Taylor may be saying between the lines.Swifties didn’t waste time pulling receipts. The lyric “dug me out of my grave” is being hailed as a symbolic nod to Travis, the man fans believe helped lift Taylor from the emotional stagnation she experienced during her long romance with Joe. And the shade? It’s there in sharpened form.When Taylor sings, “All that time, I sat alone in my tower / You were just honing your powers,” listeners immediately connected it to Joe’s famously private lifestyle and his recent role in a new Hamlet film.The overlap between Ophelia, Hamlet, and Taylor’s real-life history is simply too on-the-nose for fans to ignore.What makes this moment hit even harder is how openly Taylor seems to be reclaiming her narrative. Rather than turning her breakup into bitterness, she’s framing it as the final chapter of a darker era, one that allowed her to rise stronger and choose a love that fits her world rather than hides from it. Joe, for his part, has subtly signaled he’s over the conversation, reportedly saying he’s moved on and suggesting fans do the same. But Swifties aren’t budging.For Taylor, this track feels like a mic-drop: a poetic goodbye to the past, a wink at the present, and a reminder that she’ll always turn heartbreak into art, even if some people would prefer not to be name-checked in her mythology.","Taylor Swift's new song, 'The Fate of Ophelia,' is fueling fan theories linking it to her breakup with Joe Alwyn.

Doctors previously described the early prognosis as “positive,” and the new video confirms that his recovery is trending in the right direction.The Cam Skattebo injury was one of the most severe of the season. He suffered with a dislocated ankle, an open tibia fracture and a ruptured deltoid ligament.An open fracture, where the bone breaks through the skin, increases the risk of infection and makes the recovery much longer.It also requires immediate surgery, ligament repair, fracture stabilization, and months of follow-up care.This is why the Giants ruled him out for the rest of the year shortly after the injury.The short answer: No.According to the latest Cam Skattebo injury update, he is officially out for the remainder of the 2025 season. Experts believe the earliest realistic return for Skattebo is sometime in 2026, depending on how his rehab progresses.

Michael Penix Jr., the rookie quarterback of the Atlanta Falcons, became the center of an online conversation on Wednesday after a simple answer in his midweek press conference was taken the wrong way. He was asked where he goes for advice, and he mentioned his fiancée and his quarterback coaches back home. Some fans online claimed this meant he was not getting help from the Falcons staff, even though he never suggested that.On Friday in Atlanta, head coach Raheem Morris stepped forward to defend Michael Penix Jr. and shut down the idea that the rookie was criticizing his coaching staff. Morris spoke before Sunday’s home game against the Carolina Panthers and called the online reaction “overblown” and unfair. His comments made it clear he did not want the rookie dealing with a story that he believes was created out of nothing.During his Friday press conference, Raheem Morris spoke strongly about the way people reacted to Michael Penix Jr.’s comments.He told reporters, through Marc Raimondi of ESPN.com, that the whole situation was “a joke.” Morris said people were trying to stretch a harmless clip into something that it was never meant to be.He added, “Stop looking for stuff on a young man. You don’t need this stuff on him.” He also said he felt bad that Penix had to answer for something that was “not real.”When reporters asked Michael Penix Jr. if he wanted to explain his comments again, he declined and said everyone inside the building already knows the truth.Morris backed that up by naming everyone who works closely with the rookie every day.He said Penix has support from offensive coordinator Zac Robinson, quarterbacks coach D.J. Williams, passing game coordinator T.J. Yates, senior offensive assistant Ken Zampese, and veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins, who serves as the team’s No. 2 quarterback.D.J. Williams also spoke on Friday and said he talks to the quarterbacks more than he talks to his own children.Also Read: Bad Bunny’s Huge Latin Grammy Win Now Puts Massive Pressure And Hype On His 2025 Super Bowl Stage He said he never brought up the comments with Penix because they were never seen as a problem inside the team.The Falcons head into Sunday’s game with a 3-6 record after a season full of ups and downs.They have strong wins over the Minnesota Vikings and Buffalo Bills but bad losses to the Carolina Panthers and Miami Dolphins. Another loss to Carolina on Sunday would drop Atlanta to 3-7 and make their playoff chances even harder.","Michael Penix Jr. was asked where he goes for advice and he mentioned his fiancée and his quarterback coaches back home.

How Tyreek Hill’s injury and cryptic bio update sparked questions about his next destination





Tyreek Hill Will Be Back For Start Of 2026 After Devastating Knee Injury?! | Pat McAfee

More coverage in NFL:





Tyreek Hill’s 2025 season ended far earlier than anyone expected, and now his future in the NFL is suddenly one of the league’s most talked-about mysteries. The Miami Dolphins star, long known for redefining speed on the field, is now confronting a reality that few elite athletes truly prepare for: what comes after the spotlight. A dislocated knee suffered in late September not only removed him from the season, but it also forced him into deep reflection about what he still wants from the game and whether his next chapter might unfold away from football.In the weeks following the injury, Hill has offered more hints than answers. A surprising update to his Instagram bio with just one word, “unemployed,” sent shockwaves across social media. Combined with his recent comments about contemplating retirement, the focus has quickly shifted from when he will return to whether he will return at all.Hill’s turning point came in Week 4 against the Jets, when an awkward sideline tackle left his leg visibly crooked. Instead of panic, the 31-year-old felt gratitude. Speaking on Terron Armstead’s “The Set” podcast, he shared how the moment brought his entire football journey into perspective. He admitted that while he still loves the game, the physical and mental grind has taken a heavy toll and that he would be at peace if this chapter ended sooner rather than later.The Dolphins’ situation adds even more complexity. Hill may have updated his bio, but he remains under contract with Miami on a deal restructured last year worth $90 million over three seasons. Still, with his 32nd birthday approaching, a major knee injury behind him, and a looming $51.9 million cap hit in 2026, Miami faces difficult decisions. Cutting him next year would save the team nearly $24 million in cap space, making him a realistic candidate for a move regardless of intent.Meanwhile, Hill appears to be exploring life beyond football. After hinting on the podcast that retirement was on the table, he recently announced his new side career as a DJ, another signal that he’s thinking about the next phase of his life.As speculation swirls, one question remains at the center of it all: Where is Tyreek Hill really headed next? Whether it’s a comeback with Miami, a fresh start elsewhere, or a full transition into life beyond the NFL, his next move may define one of the most surprising turns of the 2025 season.","Tyreek Hill’s 2025 season ended far earlier than anyone expected, and now his future in the NFL is suddenly one of the league's most talked-about mysteries.

Los Angeles Lakers pulled into federal spotlight as NBA widens probe into illegal sports-betting scandal





The Los Angeles Lakers have apparently been included in the ongoing federal investigation into sports betting and illicit gambling by prominent athletes. Six league sources told The Athletic that as part of its investigation into illicit sports gambling, the NBA has reportedly requested records and other property from many teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers.Lakers associate trainer Mike Mancias and executive administrator Randy Mims are two of the staff members who have previously cooperated and willingly turned over their mobile phones to investigators, according to league sources.As part of its efforts to comply with the federal authorities about the probe, the NBA reportedly requested that the Lakers and other teams turn over papers and personal belongings, including cell phones, according to The Athletic.Under congressional scrutiny, the league is requesting additional information regarding the criminal charges filed by the Department of Justice last month. Following the arrest and charges of Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups last month, House and Senate committees questioned the NBA about why it failed to find reliable evidence that players and coaches were involved in a plot to use personal information to help bettors win money.Announcing the news, the Athletic shared on X:“BREAKING NEWS: The NBA has asked multiple teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers, to hand over documents and other property as part of its investigation into illegal sports gambling, six league sources told The Athletic… The league, under scrutiny from Congress, is seeking new information based on the federal charges brought last month by the Department of Justice.”NBA officials started contacting clubs through the outside legal firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, requesting access to cell phones, among other things, after arguing to a congressional committee that the league was taking the accusations seriously.According to league sources who spoke to The Athletic, Wachtell investigators are anticipated to request documents from at least ten Lakers employees due to the charges brought against Damon Jones. He is a former NBA player and LeBron James ' former shooting coach who had special access to the Lakers.This happened after the NBA has been rocked by a comprehensive federal investigation that was made public in October 2025. It claims that current and past players, coaches, and organized crime networks are involved in a large-scale illicit sports-betting and money-laundering operation.Key players indicted include Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups, who is accused of being involved in a mafia-backed underground poker operation, and Miami Heat forward Terry Rozier, who is accused of telling acquaintances that he would leave a game early to influence prop bets. Some insiders are accused of exploiting confidential injury, lineup, and performance data to make fraudulent bets on NBA games.Also read: Terry Rozier net worth: Miami Heat player's NBA journey takes an unexpected turn as he finds himself at the center of a gambling storm","Lakers associate trainer Mike Mancias and executive administrator Randy Mims are two of the staff members who have previously cooperated and willingly turned over their mobile phones to investigators.

Memphis Grizzlies rattled as star Ja Morant’s latest setback casts a shadow over an already fragile season





Ja Morant, a star player for the Memphis Grizzlies, was removed from the injury report and cleared to play in Saturday's game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. However, he has since exited the game with another problem. On November 15, with 6:01 remaining in the first quarter of the Cleveland Cavaliers game, Morant left the game and went to the locker room.The team said that he will not be returning because of right calf pain. Due to a painful right ankle from a loss to the New York Knicks on November 11, Morant was unable to play for the Grizzlies against the Boston Celtics on November 12. Before he left the game, he had seven points and two assists in six minutes.Due to right calf pain, Morant missed the rest of Saturday's game against the Cavaliers. The Murray State product's availability has steadily declined after he played a career-high 67 games in the pandemic-shortened 2019–20 season due to health and suspension concerns. Over the previous two seasons, he appeared in a total of 59 games.

The Stein Line announced the same on X and wrote:“Memphis' Ja Morant did play today in Cleveland but is now ruled out for the rest of the game with right calf soreness…”Due to Morant's absence, Cam Spencer, Cedric Coward, and Vince Williams will play larger roles and receive greater playing time for the rest of the season.

Willie Green ’s Tenure and Contributions to the New Orleans Pelicans

Issues That Led to Willie Green’s Firing

Was Moving On From Willie Green the Right Decision?

James Borrego Steps In: What the New Orleans Pelicans Can Expect

Impact on the Pelicans’ Title Aspirations

A New Chapter for the Franchise





The New Orleans Pelicans’ decision to dismiss Willie Green after a disastrous 2-10 start to the 2025-26 NBA season was a shocker for the league. What was once viewed as a promising coaching partnership quickly unraveled amid mounting losses, internal dissatisfaction, and ongoing concerns about the team’s lack of structure. The firing represents a major turning point for the franchise - a move signaling urgency, accountability, and a desire to salvage a season threatening to slip away early.This moment is especially crucial because the New Orleans Pelicans entered the year with high aspirations. With Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram healthy, the addition of veteran depth, and a revamped basketball operations department led by Joe Dumars, expectations were higher than ever. Instead, a string of early-season blowouts and visibly fractured team chemistry pushed the organization toward a difficult but necessary reset. Against this backdrop, the New Orleans Pelicans are now trusting James Borrego as interim head coach to stabilize the locker room and revive a roster loaded with talent but starved of direction.Willie Green arrived in 2021 with optimism surrounding his experience as a key assistant during the Phoenix Suns’ Finals run.Early signs were encouraging. Green guided the New Orleans Pelicans to noticeable progress, culminating in a franchise-best 49-win season, two playoff appearances, and improved consistency after years of instability. His coaching philosophy embraced a modern, perimeter-heavy offense, with New Orleans attempting over 32 three-pointers per game - an approach aligned with league-wide trends.Green also excelled in developing young players. Josh Hart and Trey Murphy III became essential rotation pieces under his guidance, and his leadership helped the team find success when Zion Williamson remained healthy. In fact, the Pelicans’ winning patterns strongly correlated with Zion’s availability, supporting the belief that Green could build around his stars when the roster was intact. For several seasons, it appeared he was laying the foundation for long-term competitiveness and internal growth.Despite that early promise, Willie Green’s tenure grew increasingly turbulent. Major concerns centered on his in-game adjustments, which were frequently criticized as too slow, reactive, or ineffective. The New Orleans Pelicans suffered repeated blowouts, often by margins exceeding 30 points, highlighting a troubling lack of composure and strategic adaptability. These issues intensified during the start of the 2025–26 campaign, where New Orleans endured three 30-point losses within its first six games - an unprecedented stretch in franchise history.Rotations and lineup decisions added further frustration. Players and fans questioned the lack of consistency in roles, while defensive breakdowns and poor transition effort led to widespread doubts about the team’s overall discipline. Although injuries to Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram played a role in some losses, the New Orleans Pelicans struggled to find alternative scoring options or reliable schemes to compensate for their absences. Reports also emerged of friction between the coaching staff and front office, alongside dissatisfaction in the locker room regarding minutes and role clarity. These combined issues created an environment that management could no longer overlook.Given the trajectory of the franchise, the decision to part ways with Willie Green appears warranted. He was given more than four seasons to solidify his coaching philosophy, build a cohesive system, and guide the New Orleans Pelicans deeper into the playoffs. Instead, the team plateaued and eventually regressed - significantly so at the start of the current season. Joe Dumars, now overseeing basketball operations, opted to begin the year with Willie Green in place, suggesting that the firing was not impulsive but rather a last resort after extensive evaluation.Ownership, led by Gayle Benson, had previously expressed public confidence in Willie Green but ultimately deferred to Dumars’ judgment. Firing him early in the season opens the door for a new coach to address systemic issues with enough time to potentially salvage playoff hopes. In this context, the move reflects a broader organizational acknowledgment that the Pelicans needed a new voice and a fresh strategic direction.With James Borrego now serving as interim head coach, New Orleans Pelicans are expected to undergo immediate stylistic and tactical shifts. Borrego, known for his experience developing young players and implementing structured offensive and defensive systems, brings a steady hand to a locker room in need of clarity. His focus will likely center on establishing stronger rotations, defining roles more clearly, and enforcing defensive accountability - all areas where the Pelicans struggled under Willie Green.If Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram can stay healthy, Borrego has a chance to reinvigorate a talented core that has underachieved. A balanced approach - maintaining the three-point emphasis but integrating more interior scoring and consistent defensive schemes - could help the team climb back into contention. While a coaching change alone won’t produce immediate championship results, it could provide the spark needed for the New Orleans Pelicans to regain traction and re-enter the playoff race.The Pelicans’ title odds may receive a modest boost following the coaching change, largely due to the expectation of improved structure, decision-making, and locker room stability. However, realistic championship contention remains tied to several variables: roster health, in-season trades, and the synergy between Borrego and the front office. A revitalized team identity and better in-game adjustments - two areas of weakness under Willie Green - will be crucial in determining whether New Orleans can make a late push.Ultimately, while Borrego’s arrival brings hope, long-term success will depend equally on front office support and the continued development of the roster. The team’s path to title relevance hinges on decisive and aligned leadership both on the court and behind the scenes.Willie Green’s dismissal is more than a coaching change as it shows the New Orleans Pelicans’ heightened expectations and refusal to waste another season with a talented roster. Willie Green’s strengths in player development and culture-building were undeniable, yet his inability to adapt strategically limited the franchise’s upward trajectory. With Borrego stepping in, there is cautious optimism that New Orleans can regain momentum, restore defensive identity, and piece together a playoff campaign.Also read: New Orleans Pelicans cut ties with Willie Green after a brutal 2-10 collapse The coming months will determine whether this coaching shift becomes the catalyst for sustained success or simply another chapter in the New Orleans Pelicans’ ongoing search for stability. What remains clear is that the organization is committed to reshaping its future - and this move marks the first decisive step toward that goal.","Willie Green was fired as head coach of the New Orleans Pelicans after a disastrous 2-10 start to the 2025-26 NBA season.

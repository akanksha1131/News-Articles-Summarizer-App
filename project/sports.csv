India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak shares key update on Shubman Gill's fitness ahead of second Test in Guwahati

NEW DELHI: India Test captain Shubman Gill has been released from the squad ahead of the Guwahati Test and has already left for Mumbai on Friday. The youngster travelled with the side on November 19 but didn't turn up for training on November 20. It is learnt that he will be resting in Mumbai for the next two-three days before seeking specialist opinion from Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala. As of now, there is no trip planned to the BCCI Centre of Excellence (CoE) and more clarity is expected in the coming days.In Gill's absence, Pant will lead the side in the crucial second Test vs South Africa starting November 22. The team management will have to take some tough Playing XI calls and as TimesofIndia.com had reported, Sai Sudharsan and Nitish Kumar Reddy are frontrunners to be picked with Axar Patel likely to return on the bench. In the training session on eve of the match, only KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sudharsan turned up as the rest took it easy.India lost the first Test at the Eden Gardens inside three days and a lot of focus has been on the playing surface since then. While Eden wasn't the ideal surface, Guwahati is expected to roll out a red soil pitch which will offer both turn and bounce. It may not be as unplayable as Eden but will keep the spinners in play.India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak spoke at length about the pitch for the opening Test and felt it wasn't something they expected.""See, in the last match wicket, Gautam said that he took all the blame on himself. He said that he took the blame because he felt that he should not put the blame on the curators,"" Kotak said. ""Now, what happened in the last match, after a day, it felt like it was crumbling. There was a little bit of soil [that came up after the ball pitched]. All of you can see that. That was not expected. Even if the spin was expected, it was after 3 days or on the third day in the evening. Sometimes, the weather, sometimes, even the curators did not want it. I am telling you the truth. No one wanted it to be like this.""",India Test captain Shubman Gill has been released from the squad ahead of the Guwahati Test.

'Tighter jeans this time': Magnus Carlsen reignites 'fashion war' with FIDE ahead of World Rapid & Blitz 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/tighter-jeans-this-time-magnus-carlsen-reignites-fashion-war-with-fide-ahead-of-world-rapid-blitz-2025/articleshow/125476484.cms,"Returning to the World Rapid & Blitz Championship in Doha, Magnus Carlsen isn't holding back – he has playfully resurrected the 'jeansgate' drama from last year in a recent social media post. With a nod to 'viral rage moments' and a commitment to tighter jeans, he teases a fun and defiant stance towards FIDE’s attire rules.

Poll Do you think FIDE's dress code policy is outdated? Yes, it needs revision. No, rules are important.

NEW DELHI: Magnus Carlsen has reignited his long-running feud with FIDE in trademark style, firing off a cheeky yet brutal jab at the chess world’s governing body soon after his participation in the World Rapid & Blitz Championship 2025 was confirmed. The Norwegian superstar, who tops the list of 360 registered players, took to social media to remind everyone — especially FIDE — that he has not forgotten “jeansgate,” the controversy that rocked last year’s championship.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Carlsen, disqualified in 2024 for wearing jeans in violation of the federation’s dress code, was fined $200 and asked to change. Instead, he famously walked out of the rapid event before later returning for the blitz section only after FIDE softened its stance and allowed “appropriate jeans.” The dramatic standoff divided the chess world, with critics accusing Carlsen of leveraging his influence and others defending his right to dress comfortably.On Thursday, as FIDE announced the player list for Doha 2025, Carlsen responded with a tweet dripping in sarcasm and defiance. “Nine years ago, I left the world rapid and blitz in Doha with two near misses and some viral rage moments,” he posted. “This year, I hope to improve on the former… Also, I’ll be grinding at the gym to fit into tighter jeans than last time.”The message instantly went viral, signalling that the five-time world champion is prepared to relive — and perhaps escalate — the fashion-fuelled conflict that dominated last year’s headlines.Carlsen’s participation had been uncertain due to his ongoing clash with FIDE over the Freestyle Chess Grand Slam and the fallout from his disqualification. But his tweet not only confirmed his return; it delivered another sharp poke at the federation’s authority.For context, the jeans Carlsen wore during the 2024 controversy were later auctioned for Rs 31 lakh ($36,100), turning the moment into one of the most bizarre chapters in modern chess history.With Carlsen promising “viral rage moments” once again, the Doha championship may have already found its biggest storyline before a single piece has been moved.",Magnus Carlsen will play in World Rapid & Blitz Championship 2025 in Doha.

Gautam Gambhir under fire: 'Were we wasting time with Karun Nair or Sai Sudharsan?' - Ex-India cricketer questions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-south-africa/gautam-gambhir-under-fire-were-we-wasting-time-with-karun-nair-or-sai-sudharsan-ex-india-cricketer-questions/articleshow/125475956.cms,"Kolkata: India's Sai Sudharsan with head coach Gautam Gambhir (PTI Photo/Swapan Mahapatra)

Why coach Gautam Gambhir can't continue with his IPL ways in Test cricket

India’s evolving approach to their batting order has once again raised eyebrows, with head coach Gautam Gambhir and the team management making another unexpected shuffle during the first Test against South Africa at Eden Gardens. In a move that surprised many, India fielded four frontline spinners and sent Washington Sundar in at number 3, a slot previously occupied by Sai Sudharsan in the West Indies series earlier this year. Before that, both Sudharsan and Karun Nair had been used at the same position during the tour of England.Former India batter Aakash Chopra voiced his concerns over the continuous reshuffling and questioned whether the team was lacking clarity in its long-term plans.“Washington Sundar has presented himself as a phenomenal option who can bat at the top of the order, and of course is a more than handy bowler. The bigger question that Gautam and the team management need to answer is are we going to keep changing goalposts after every series?” Chopra said during a JioStar media day interaction.Sudharsan, who made scores of 7, 87 and 39 against the West Indies, found himself out of the XI for the opening Test against South Africa. Sundar replaced him at number 3 and made 29 and 31 in the match.“You’re well within your rights to go with Washington, but if Washi is your long term choice, then were we just wasting time with Sai Sudharsan or even Karun Nair to bat at 3?” Chopra asked.He stressed that India’s top order must prioritise pure batting attributes above all else.“You would first want to prioritise the batting capabilities, not only the skill but also the temperament and the patience and the ability to bat time. That is why you look for the purest specialists who have only one job to do. Your top 4 or 5 are there just to bat and nothing else.”Chopra added that if Sundar is indeed being groomed primarily as a batter, the last several months of experimentation may have served little purpose.“If you choose Washington Sundar as a batter, fair enough, but it just feels like the last six or seven months were futile and you didn't really gain anything from it,” he said.He also questioned the messaging to Sudharsan, who performed reasonably well but still lost his place.“What message do you give to Sai Sudharsan that we gave you a chance, you scored the runs, but we had a change of heart. Transition gives you the chance to experiment, but what makes it easier is clarity and consistency,” Chopra concluded.",India's evolving approach to their batting order has once again raised eyebrows.

'When you don't play well, this is what happens': Gautam Gambhir reacts to 1st Test defeat, points out what India lacked

India head into the second Test against South Africa at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati knowing that nothing less than a win will keep the series alive. After the heavy defeat in the first Test, the pressure is immense, and much of it rests on Rishabh Pant ’s shoulders. The dynamic wicketkeeper-batter, currently one of India’s most influential Test players, is set to take on a bigger role than ever before.With Shubman Gill unlikely to feature due to the neck spasm he picked up in the opening Test, Pant will step in as captain, marking his debut as India’s Test skipper. This promotion places him alongside one of the greatest names in Indian cricketing history. Once he leads the side out in Guwahati, Pant will become only the second wicketkeeper to captain India in Test cricket, following MS Dhoni , who last led the side in his final Test in 2014. Pant will also enter the record books as India’s 38th Test captain.The match in Guwahati will also come with a unique change in timing. In most Indian venues, a traditional Test day starts at 9.30am, with lunch and tea breaks following the usual pattern. But Guwahati, sitting on the far eastern edge of the country, sees daylight arrive and disappear earlier than most parts of India. With no daylight saving system in place, the early sunset can squeeze playing hours.To accommodate local conditions, the BCCI has adjusted the schedule for this Test. Play will begin 30 minutes earlier than usual. The opening session will be followed by a shorter tea break instead of lunch, and the longer lunch interval will be pushed to early afternoon, around 1.30pm local time. The rearranged timings are aimed at maximising available daylight and ensuring a full day’s play.With history beckoning for Pant and India fighting to avoid another home setback, the second Test in Guwahati promises high stakes, new challenges and a fresh storyline.",Rishabh Pant will captain India in the second Test against South Africa.

Steve Smith fires back

Sandpapergate: The controversy Panesar referenced

Australia’s stand-in Test captain Steve Smith delivered a scathing and unexpected response to Monty Panesar after the former England spinner urged Ben Stokes and the English media to target him over the 2018 Sandpapergate scandal during the upcoming Ashes series.Smith, who confirmed Australia’s XI for the Ashes opener in Perth, was asked about Panesar’s provocative remarks — and he did not hold back. Rather than engaging on the subject of ball-tampering, the Australian star went straight for Panesar’s credibility by revisiting his infamous 2019 appearance on the UK quiz show Celebrity Mastermind.In recent comments, Panesar had urged England to use psychological pressure against Smith.“Ben Stokes and the England team have got to make Steve Smith feel guilty and play on that,” Panesar said while referring to Sandpapergate.He added that England should sledge Smith by questioning his ethics and captaincy: “Say something like, ‘I don’t think it’s ethical that he’s the captain.’ Really get into him and make him feel guilty… Use it as a way to help England.”Panesar went further, saying the UK media should pile on as well: “If it were the opposite, the Australian media would be all over it… ‘the cheaters have arrived’, right?”Smith’s response at the press conference ahead of the Perth Test left the room stunned.“I’m going to go off topic for a second here,” he began. “Who in the room has seen Mastermind with Monty Panesar on it? Any of you?”Smith then encouraged everyone to watch Panesar’s clip, describing it as “pretty comical.”Highlighting the former spinner’s notorious mistakes on the quiz show, Smith continued:“Anyone that believes Athens is in Germany, that Oliver Twist is a season of the year, and that America is a city… those comments don’t really bother me. That’s as far as I’ll go with that one.”The swipe landed hard — a calculated dismissal of Panesar’s stance without even engaging with the actual cricketing criticism.The Sandpapergate saga dates back to 2018 when Cameron Bancroft was caught using sandpaper on the ball during a Test in South Africa. Smith admitted he was aware of the plan and received a one-year captaincy ban along with a playing suspension, while David Warner was handed an even harsher penalty, as he would never again be considered for a leadership position within the Australia team.Though the scandal remains a talking point overseas, Smith has rebuilt his career and continues to be one of Australia’s most important Test batters.",Steve Smith responds to Monty Panesar's comments on Sandpapergate.

A season poised for more milestones

The stage is set for another thrilling chapter of franchise cricket as the International League T20 gears up for Season 4, beginning on Tuesday, December 2 - a date that coincides with UAE National Day. The six-team, 34-match tournament promises a spectacular opening and will culminate with the final on Sunday, January 4, 2026.As excitement builds, it’s the perfect time to revisit the standout bowlers and defining spells that have shaped the ILT20’s first three seasons - performances that have elevated the league into one of the most competitive and talent-rich T20 spectacles in world cricket.The ILT20’s bowling charts are headlined by Afghanistan’s rapidly rising pace star Fazalhaq Farooqi, who last season became the first player in league history to reach 50 wickets. With 50 wickets in 29 matches for MI Emirates, Farooqi’s ability to swing the new ball and strike in the death overs has made him one of the most influential bowlers in the tournament.Following him is Wanindu Hasaranga , the Sri Lankan spin ace who has been at the heart of the Desert Vipers’ bowling unit. Hasaranga has taken 39 wickets in 26 matches, operating at a superb economy rate of 6.38, the best among frontline bowlers in the league.Rounding off the top three is England’s seasoned T20 specialist Chris Jordan, who has delivered consistently for the Gulf Giants.His 35 wickets in 24 matches, combined with his composure in pressure situations, have made him a key figure in their success.While consistency has defined the top wicket-takers, individual brilliance has created unforgettable moments in the league’s history.Farooqi again leads the way with the best bowling figures in ILT20 history - a stunning 5/16 against the Dubai Capitals in Season 3. His combination of swing, pace variation, and relentless accuracy dismantled the opposition, cementing his status as one of the tournament’s premier bowlers.In Season 1, the Gulf Giants’ David Wiese produced a superb spell of 5/20 against the Sharjah Warriorz, showcasing his knack for breakthroughs at crucial junctures. That same edition saw Naveen-ul-Haq etch his name into the record books with the league’s first-ever five-wicket haul - a fiery 5/38 against the Gulf Giants.With the ILT20 entering its fourth season, the league is primed for new records, breakout stars, and fierce competition between some of the world’s best T20 bowlers.From blistering pace to crafty spin and clutch death bowling, the tournament continues to raise the bar for franchise cricket in the region.Season 4 promises more magical spells, more landmark performances - and perhaps, new names etched into the record books.","MI Emirates’ Fazalhaq Farooqi is the leading wicket-taker in ILT20 history.

IPL 2026 retained players: Who stayed where and for how much

Poll Do you think Punjab Kings will repeat their success from last season? Yes, they will repeat their performance No, they will struggle this season

Punjab Kings co-owner Ness Wadia says the franchise is in such a stable position after the IPL 2026 retentions that the upcoming auction may hold little more than formality for them.After years of constant rebuilds, PBKS head into December’s event in Abu Dhabi with only four slots to fill and Rs 11.5 crore available, which is in stark contrast to last season, when they retained just two players and entered the auction with Rs 110.5 crore.Much of that stability has come under the captain-coach partnership of Shreyas Iyer and Ricky Ponting, who guided PBKS to their first IPL final in 11 years.The overhaul last year, including the mega auction in Jeddah, has left the side with a settled core.Speaking to PTI, Wadia said the franchise finally has the balance it long sought.“We don't even really need to go into the auction. But we will to see how to solidify what we already have, which is a very solid team,” he told PTI, while crediting the leadership group for the shift.He added that the build-up over the past year was key.“The mega auction for us in Jeddah last year was very crucial. Now that we have Ricky and Shreyas working together with all their very valuable support staff, we're very comfortable with where we are,” Wadia said.PBKS released Glenn Maxwell as expected, while Josh Inglis was let go due to his unavailability for most of the upcoming season. Praveen Dubey, Kuldeep Sen and Vishnu Vinod also exited, none of whom were part of the XI.Wadia stressed that the target remains unchanged despite last season's strong run. “The job is not done yet as the goal was always to win the IPL,” he said.Repeating last season’s performance, he said, will be the bigger test. “Season one, we've done it. We have to repeat that again and make sure that we do that consistently,” Wadia said.The PBKS co-owner also pointed to the admiration following the team earned with their aggressive cricket. “They brought a different new game and backed their instincts and it was fun to watch… They captured the minds and hearts of everyone,” he said to PTI, before adding, “Having said that, nothing succeeds like winning.”","Punjab Kings reached the 2025 IPL final after a strong run, but fell to RCB.

Australia’s Border Force has taken a dig at England through a post on social media on the eve of the Ashes, using the Jonny Bairstow stumping from the 2023 series to send a pointed message to English supporters arriving for the first Test in Perth.The post came just as England are set to take on Australia for the first Test in Perth, along with a public service announcement aimed at the 40,000 English fans expected to travel for the tour.The Australian Border Force posted a picture of Bairstow’s controversial stumping at Lord’s, which ignited Ashes series of 2023 in England.""On the eve of the Ashes, we're back with another friendly PSA for our international travellers.

Bairstow ducked, the ball bounced twice to reach Aussie keeper Alex Carey, and the wicketkeeper immediately underarmed it back onto the stumps. Bairstow had wandered out of his crease without waiting for the ball to be declared dead, with neither umpire having called ‘over’.

Poll Should Australia aim to provoke Ben Stokes during the match? Yes, it could be an advantage. No, it's too risky.

Australia’s stand-in captain Steve Smith has singled out England skipper Ben Stokes as the key figure his side must contain when the Ashes opens at Perth Stadium on Friday. With Pat Cummins ruled out through injury, Smith steps in for his 41st Test as leader and made it clear that Stokes remains England’s biggest influence across formats.Speaking on the eve of the match, Smith underlined Stokes’ impact. “He (Stokes) has done a terrific job with England over the last couple of years,” Smith said. He added that the all-rounder is not someone Australia wants to provoke, noting, “Potentially, he’s someone who you don't want to get riled up. He has had a few performances against us where he's either taken the game away from us or pulled it back (for England). ”Smith described Stokes as a constant presence in the contest: “He's a quality performer, whether it's bat, ball, or in the field. He's always in the game, giving his 110%. Hopefully, we can keep him quiet.”England arrive confident under the Stokes–Brendon McCullum pairing, whose aggressive style has defined their recent Test cricket. Smith said Australia will have to manage the tempo carefully. “I think it's just playing the tempo of the game that needs to be played at each certain time,” he explained.He added that there will be phases when England score quickly, during which Australia may need to hold back before choosing moments to counterattack.The opening Test will also mark debuts for Jake Weatherald and Brendan Doggett. Weatherald is set to open with Usman Khawaja after a strong domestic run. Smith praised the left-hander’s preparation, saying, “I watched him bat in the nets pretty closely… He took it on and got in really good positions… He has been selected for his performances in the last 18 months in particular.”Smith said Weatherald’s rise has been earned through consistency. “I'm really excited for him… he has worked hard for a long period of time, and he is going to complement Usman Khawaja pretty well up top,” he added.Australia have a strong record at the venue but were beaten there by India last summer. Smith said conditions look familiar, adding, “It looks like a good wicket… It's going to have some decent pace and bounce in it.”With large crowds expected, Smith said the atmosphere will lift the contest: “This series has been on people's radar for a long time. I think it's a nice place to start the summer.”","Steve Smith has singled out England skipper Ben Stokes as the key figure his side must contain when the Ashes opens on Friday.

Poll Do you think Scotland can make a significant impact in the 2026 World Cup? Definitely! Maybe, with the right preparation Unlikely, not strong enough I have no opinion

Scotland captain Andy Robertson revealed emotional thoughts about his late Liverpool teammate Diogo Jota after Scotland secured qualification for the 2026 World Cup by defeating Denmark 4-2 on Tuesday, marking their first World Cup appearance since 1998.Scotland's victory came through goals from Scott McTominay, Lawrence Shankland, Kieran Tierney, and Kenny McLean in the match against Denmark at their home ground.Robertson shared his deep emotional connection to the achievement, particularly thinking about his former teammate Jota, who died at 28 in a car accident in July.""I've hidden it well, but today I've been in bits,"" Robertson told the BBC. ""I know the age I'm at, this could be my last chance to go to the World Cup. I couldn't get my mate Diogo Jota out of my head today.""""We talked so much about going to the World Cup because he missed the last one with Portugal and I did with Scotland. I know he'll be smiling down on me today. I'm so glad it's ended up this way.""""This group of boys, this group of staff – it's the best group I've been involved in. The manager's speech before the game was unbelievable. We were quite emotional. To do it for him, the staff, and all our families, it'll go down as one of the greatest nights of my life.""Jota had missed the 2022 World Cup in Qatar due to a calf injury, and the two players had shared dreams of making it to the tournament with their respective countries.McTominay opened the scoring for Scotland with a spectacular bicycle kick goal three minutes into the match, exciting the home crowd.McLean sealed the victory with an impressive strike from the half-way line in the final moments of the game, securing Scotland's place in the North American World Cup.Portugal, Jota's national team, had also secured their qualification for the 2026 World Cup with a 9-1 win over Armenia on Sunday.The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be hosted jointly by the United States, Canada, and Mexico.","Scotland secured qualification for the 2026 World Cup by defeating Denmark 4-2 on Tuesday.

FIFA Shuts Down Trump's 2026 World Cup 'Unsafe Cities' Threat With Bold Remark

Poll Do you think Curacao's qualification for the World Cup will inspire other small nations in football? Yes, definitely! Possibly, but it depends on circumstances. Not really, it's a unique case. No, small nations face too many challenges.

In one of the most extraordinary nights in CONCACAF football history, the tiny Caribbean island of Curacao — home to just 156,000 people — scripted an unprecedented chapter by becoming the smallest country ever to qualify for the FIFA World Cup . Their tense 0-0 draw against Jamaica in Kingston on Tuesday was enough to secure passage to the 2026 finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico.The result capped a dramatic, nerve-wracking finale to the qualifiers, where Curacao survived relentless pressure from Jamaica — who struck the woodwork three times in the second half — and escaped a last-minute penalty scare. Salvadoran referee Ivan Barton initially pointed to the spot after Jeremy Antonisse clipped Dujuan Richards inside the box, but VAR overturned the call in a stunning twist that preserved Curacao’s historic dream.Coached by veteran Dutch tactician Dick Advocaat, who missed the clash due to a family emergency, the ‘Blue Wave’ finished atop Group B with 12 points from six matches, one clear of Jamaica. Curacao now surpass Iceland (population ~350,000 in 2018) as the smallest nation to ever reach a World Cup — a milestone made possible in the first edition featuring 48 teams.Elsewhere, the night produced more fairytale scenes. Haiti, forced to play “home” matches in Curacao due to political unrest, sealed their first World Cup appearance since 1974 after a crucial 2-0 win over Nicaragua.Goals from Louicius Don Deedson and Ruben Providence, combined with Honduras’ goalless draw against Costa Rica, lifted Haiti to the top of Group C with 11 points.Meanwhile, Panama secured the final automatic CONCACAF berth with a dominant 3-0 win over El Salvador, extinguishing Suriname’s hopes despite their qualification for the playoffs.For Curacao, the smallest of football nations, a World Cup dream once thought impossible is now gloriously real — a landmark for the island, the Caribbean, and world football itself.","Smallest nation to qualify for the World Cup, Curacao, beats Costa Rica 1-0. First time in history that two nations have qualified for the same tournament. The first time that two teams from the same country have done so.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125426769,imgsize-106144,width-400,resizemode-4/curacao.jpg"

Kieran Tierney and Kenny McLean scored spectacular injury-time goals to give Scotland a dramatic 4-2 victory over Denmark on Tuesday, sealing their qualification for the 2026 World Cup. Spain also confirmed their spot after a 2-2 draw with Turkey. Belgium joined them with a 7-0 demolition of Liechtenstein, while Switzerland and Austria both secured their places after picking up draws. All five nations will feature at the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico next year.Scotland’s late surge in Glasgow ensured Steve Clarke’s team reached the World Cup for the first time since 1998. With the match tied at 2-2 beyond the 90th minute, Denmark were on course to progress as Group C winners until Tierney curled in a superb long-range strike three minutes into stoppage time. McLean settled the contest deep into added time, lofting the ball over Kasper Schmeichel from the halfway line in the 98th minute after spotting the Danish goalkeeper far off his line.“That just sums up this squad,” captain Andy Robertson told the BBC. “Never say die. We just keep going right to the end and one of the craziest games. We put the country through it, but I’m sure it’s worth it. We’re going to the World Cup.”Scotland made the perfect start when Scott McTominay scored with an overhead kick in the third minute.Rasmus Hojlund equalised for Denmark from the penalty spot just before the hour, but the visitors were reduced to 10 men soon after when Rasmus Kristensen received a second yellow card. Hampden Park erupted again in the 78th minute as Lawrence Shankland tapped in from close range, only for Patrick Dorgu to level four minutes later. Tierney and McLean then delivered the decisive blows. Denmark now head to Thursday’s draw for the European play-offs, scheduled for March.Switzerland booked their sixth straight World Cup appearance after a 1-1 draw in Pristina against Kosovo. Needing only to avoid a heavy defeat, they stayed in control for most of the match. Ruben Vargas put them ahead early in the second half, before Florent Muslija equalised.Spain, the Euro 2024 champions, also needed to avoid a seven-goal loss in Seville against Turkey and never looked in danger. Dani Olmo opened the scoring, though Deniz Gul and Salih Ozcan found the net for Turkey to hand Spain their first goals conceded in qualifying. Mikel Oyarzabal equalised after the hour to preserve Spain’s unbeaten run. “We wanted to finish with a win and a clean sheet, so it’s bitter-sweet... but we’re happy to qualify for the World Cup,” Olmo told TVE.Austria snatched a place at their first World Cup in 28 years after a 1-1 draw with Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to Michael Gregoritsch’s 77th-minute equaliser. Haris Tabakovic’s early strike had threatened to upset Ralf Rangnick’s side before the leveller sent Bosnia into the play-offs. “I can’t believe it; we made it! I have been trying to reach the World Cup for 18 years. Finally now, at the end of my career, we got there. I can’t wait,” said 36-year-old Marko Arnautovic, via UEFA.com.Belgium, semi-finalists in 2018, eased into the World Cup draw with a dominant win in Liege. Jeremy Doku scored twice, Charles De Ketelaere added a brace of his own and Hans Vanaken, Brandon Mechele and Alexis Saelemaekers also found the net. Wales matched that scoreline in Group J, beating North Macedonia 7-1, with Harry Wilson recording a hat-trick from set pieces. North Macedonia will still feature in the play-offs thanks to their Nations League ranking. Romania, who defeated San Marino 7-0, will also head to the play-offs after finishing third in Group H, and Sweden secured their own spot with a 1-1 draw against Slovenia.The European play-offs will feature 16 teams and offer four additional berths for next year’s World Cup in North America.","Kieran Tierney and Kenny McLean scored spectacular injury-time goals to give Scotland a dramatic 4-2 victory over Denmark on Tuesday.

A Women's Super League referee Lisa Benn told a London employment tribunal that she lost her international position after reporting that a referee coach pushed her during a game in March 2023. She claimed the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) gave her lower recommendations after she complained about coach Steve Child's conduct, BBC reported.The incident occurred at a PGMOL tournament focused on video assistant referee (VAR) training. After a delay due to an injury, Benn says Child grabbed her arm and pushed her onto the pitch to start a game.During the match, Child told a fourth official to instruct Benn to ""kill the game."" Benn responded by saying ""don't tell me how to referee"" and used an expletive towards Child.""I am a trusted referee, I referee at the highest level - this was an under-19s game,"" Benn told the panel.""He felt superior, he felt like he could come on and tell me how to referee, he manhandled me on to the field of play - he would never have done that to a male referee,"" she stated.When questioned if she had witnessed Child behaving similarly with other referees, Benn responded: ""I have to female referees, yes.I haven't to male referees.""Benn claims Child approached her after the game, grabbed her arm and said ""your card has been marked.""""He was so angry his eyes were bulging out of his head,"" she told the tribunal, as cited by BBC.PGMOL's representative Jesse Crozier suggested Child may have simply guided her to the pitch, but Benn rejected this explanation.Crozier stated: ""If you had been dragged, grabbed and pushed at a training tournament with dozens and dozens of people, someone would have seen it."" Benn disagreed with this assessment.A PGMOL investigation determined Child's actions did not warrant disciplinary measures. Benn claims that while PGMOL's chief refereeing officer Howard Webb and his wife Bibiana Steinhaus-Webb, then head of women's referees, assured her she would not face consequences for reporting the incident, the organization subsequently reduced their support for her.Benn states this reduced support resulted in her losing a position on FIFA's international referee list.The tribunal proceedings are ongoing.",Lisa Benn told a London employment tribunal that she lost her international position after reporting that a referee coach pushed her during a game in March 2023.

Poll Who do you think is in the right in the PSG vs Kylian Mbappe feud? Kylian Mbappe Paris Saint-Germain Both sides equally Neither side is right

The long-simmering feud between Paris Saint-Germain and Kylian Mbappe erupted into a full-blown legal and financial battle on Monday as both sides arrived at an industrial court with staggering monetary demands — together exceeding €700 million.The French superstar, who joined Real Madrid on a free transfer in the summer of 2024, claims PSG owes him more than €260 million. This includes unpaid wages, bonuses, severance, and damages, all stemming from his argument that his fixed-term contract should be reclassified as a permanent one — a technical shift that would entitle him to compensation for unfair dismissal.Mbappe had earlier demanded €55 million in unpaid wages. His new claim now encompasses much more, including allegations of moral harassment, undeclared work, and breaches of PSG's duty of good faith and workplace safety.“Kylian Mbappe is not asking for anything beyond what the law provides; he is simply seeking the enforcement of his legal rights, as any employee would,” his advisers said in a statement. The forward did not attend the hearing in person.PSG responded with an even larger counter-claim: €440 million. The club argues that Mbappe's refusal to extend his contract — while also rejecting a €300 million offer from Saudi side Al-Hilal in 2023 — cost them a massive “loss of opportunity” to secure a record transfer fee. The Ligue 1 champions also seek compensation for alleged breaches of good faith, reputational harm, and image damage.The club said it presented evidence that Mbappe acted “disloyally” by hiding his decision not to extend his contract for nearly a year — from July 2022 to June 2023 — leaving PSG powerless to negotiate a transfer.PSG further accused the striker of reneging on an August 2023 agreement involving a salary reduction should he leave on a free transfer. Mbappe's camp insists such an agreement never existed, and says PSG failed to provide proof.The forward has also accused the club of “lofting” — a French term describing the isolation of a player from the main squad. Mbappe was excluded from the preseason tour to Japan and South Korea and initially left out of Ligue 1's opening match after informing the club he would not trigger his extension clause.PSG has denied any harassment or mistreatment, insisting Mbappe featured in “more than 94%” of official matches that season under a coach who went on to win the Champions League.The court's ruling is expected next month, with both sides bracing for one of football's most financially explosive verdicts.","Kylian Mbappe claims PSG owes him more than €260 million.

Nick Woltemade headed the opener in the 18th minute, and once Serge Gnabry doubled the lead, the hosts never looked back. Leroy Sane struck twice before half-time, with Ridle Baku and Assan Ouedraogo completing the rout after the break.“We’re relieved. It’s a great moment,” a jubilant Woltemade told ZDF. “I’m playing, I’m scoring goals and I’m hopefully playing at the World Cup.”Elsewhere in Group A, Northern Ireland beat Luxembourg 1-0 but remained third.However, their Nations League ranking guarantees them a place in March’s 16-team European play-offs.In Amsterdam, the Netherlands delivered a high-tempo masterclass that thrilled more than 50,000 fans. Lithuania were pinned deep from the start, with Tijani Reijnders finishing off a neat move initiated by Frenkie de Jong to open the scoring. A superb first-half display by goalkeeper Edvinas Gertmonas delayed the inevitable, but Cody Gakpo’s 58th-minute penalty unlocked the floodgates. Xavi Simons and Donyell Malen struck in quick succession as Koeman’s men cruised.Reijnders, who did not debut until after the 2022 Qatar World Cup, savoured the moment. “I watched it at home, on the couch, with my Oranje shirt on,” he said. “This time it’s going to be very different for me… I’m really looking forward to taking part for the first time.”In other matches, Croatia—already assured of Group L’s top spot—fought back to beat Montenegro 3-2, while the Czech Republic thrashed Gibraltar 6-0. Poland survived a scare in Malta, edging out a chaotic 3-2 encounter but finishing second in Group G behind the Dutch.","Germany and the Netherlands have clinched their World Cup berths.

Hailee Steinfeld stays hidden in plain sight to keep the focus away from herself

Hailee builds connection behind the scenes instead of seeking on-camera moments

Hailee Steinfeld’s marriage to Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen put her directly in the NFL spotlight, yet fans rarely see her on game days. Even when she is inside Highmark Stadium, Hailee manages to stay unnoticed, avoiding cameras and blending into the background. This pattern often sparks questions from fans, but her low visibility is intentional and part of a routine she has created for the season.Hailee attends more games than most people realize, but she prefers privacy over attention. She does not share stadium photos, does not appear in crowd shots and does not look for moments that could draw media interest. The NFL season becomes a time for her to focus on presence and stability while allowing Allen to remain the center of the football narrative without added celebrity noise around him.Hailee’s quiet approach is not accidental. She chooses to stay off social media on game days and avoids the camera zones that usually highlight celebrity guests. Heavy.com captured this habit clearly, writing, “Steinfeld never posts photos from Highmark Stadium and successfully avoids the jumbotron.” Her silence during games keeps the attention where she believes it belongs.Hailee has spoken openly about how she manages her schedule during the NFL months.In an interview this October, she said, “What we do is so unpredictable, and his job is on such a strict schedule. So it’s actually a blessing, I try to organize my time so I can be where he is. This time of year, I get to hunker down, slow down, support him, and live life. When the offseason rolls around, it’s go-time for me.” Her routine is built around consistency and support rather than visibility.Even without being seen in the stands, Hailee is part of the Bills’ inner social circle. Allen and the quarterbacks often share weekly dinners with their spouses, creating strong personal bonds away from the field. Mitchell Trubisky explained it clearly, saying, “We’re able to break bread, spend some time together outside of football, continually get to know each other and just build that trust and camaraderie. The relationships here go beyond the football field and it’s something that’s really special. ”Hailee’s lowkey presence is not absence. It is a choice that keeps her grounded, keeps Allen supported and keeps their game-day life free from unnecessary attention.Also read: Isaac Rochell’s wife Allison Kuch’s genuine reaction to Ja’Marr Chase’s spitting incident leaves fans surprised",Hailee Steinfeld stays hidden in plain sight to keep the focus away from herself.

"Tyrell Shavers steals the spotlight for Buffalo Bills, outplaying Keon Coleman and catching a 44-yard touchdown from Josh Allen",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tyrell-shavers-steals-the-spotlight-for-buffalo-bills-outplaying-keon-coleman-and-catching-a-44-yard-touchdown-from-josh-allen/articleshow/125475063.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Tyrell Shavers dominates Buffalo Bills offensive snaps against Tampa Bay Buccaneers

The Buffalo Bills’ wide receiver lineup is in disarray, and the key question is who will rise to the occasion. With Dalton Kincaid out for Week 12 due to a knee issue and Curtis Samuel out with a hamstring injury, Buffalo has turned to a blend of veterans, rookies, and practice squad call-ups. Keon Coleman, the 2024 second-round draft pick from Florida State, had a standout Week 1 with 112 yards, but he’s been lackluster since, averaging just 27.3 yards per game and catching only 57.5 percent of his targets. On top of that, Coleman’s professionalism has slipped, as he arrived late to a team meeting last Friday and was a healthy scratch for the second consecutive week against the Houston Texans.This created an opportunity for Tyrell Shavers, a 26-year-old wide receiver who went undrafted and spent two seasons quietly on the Bills’ practice squad. Shavers took full advantage, showcasing a 90-yard, one-touchdown game in Week 11 while sharing the “X” receiver role with Gabe Davis. Buffalo's head coach Sean McDermott emphasized that playing time is something you earn, not something that’s just handed out. Shavers’ ascent highlights the importance of accountability, preparation, and how the Bills recognize players who come ready to play.Shavers' impressive performance against the Buccaneers wasn't just luck; it was the result of steady preparation and dependable special teams that built his credibility.In that match, he was on the field for 54 percent of the offensive plays, topping all Bills wide receivers with seven targets. His four catches featured the game-clinching 43-yard touchdown in the second quarter, where Allen rolled to the right, dodged pressure, and threw a deep pass that Shavers caught while falling into the end zone.ESPN's game recap on November 17, 2025, described the play: ""A perfectly placed 43-yard deep ball that Tyrell Shavers hauled in while tumbling into the end zone.""Shavers' influence went beyond just scoring a touchdown. He also made catches of 20 and 25 yards, contributing to Buffalo's total of 412 passing yards—their best performance since Week 1. Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady commended Shavers during a post-game press conference on November 16, sharing with reporters, ""Tyrell stepped up big time—those guys [Shavers and Davis] earned their reps,"" according to the official Bills website transcript.This performance shot Shavers into the talk for a starting spot. As we head into Week 12, his season numbers are 11 catches for 172 yards and one touchdown across 10 games, according to NFL.com. On the other hand, Coleman has 32 catches for 330 yards and three touchdowns in just nine games, but his lack of consistency got him benched.Bills beat writer Matt Parrino from Syracuse.com shared on November 16 through X that the active receivers were Shavers, Gabe Davis, Joshua Palmer, Khalil Shakir, and Mecole Hardman—clearly leaving out Coleman and Elijah Moore. Parrino's post confirmed that Shavers has stepped up into a key role.Also Read: Bryce Dunlap cause of death.

The piece, which referenced inherited CTE in hypothetical children, has drawn condemnation from fans and health experts alike for spreading dangerous misinformation and trivializing a serious neurological condition. The article link has since been removed online.

Taylor Swift Reveals Favorite Track, Talks Travis Kelce And New Album “The Life Of A Showgirl”

Vulture faces backlash after Swifties accuse ‘Stupid Issue’ article of using ableist jokes

A recent article published in New York Magazine’s Stupid Issue has put Vulture at the center of a growing backlash, after Taylor Swift fans and health experts condemned the piece for making what they describe as ableist, misogynistic, and scientifically misleading remarks. The article, which attempted to mock themes from Swift’s album The Life of a Showgirl, crossed a line for many readers when it referenced chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) while discussing hypothetical children Swift might have with her fiancé.What was intended as satire quickly became a flashpoint for criticism, especially as the comments involved a serious neurological condition and misrepresented its causes. As online outrage escalates, Vulture has quietly deleted the article link on X, but has yet to publicly address the controversy.The most inflammatory line from the article read, “It’s not just that the album also features the line ‘Did you girlboss too close to the sun?’ and a startling, detailed account of how she plans to start a neighborhood full of children with inherited CTE with the help of her fiancé’s gigantic football d*ck.”The mention of “inherited CTE” immediately drew fire, as critics argued it trivialized a life-altering condition linked to repeated head impacts, most commonly seen in contact sports. Fans also argued the remark targeted Swift’s hypothetical children in a cruel, sexist way, turning a health condition into a punchline.One reaction that went viral said, “we’ve reached a point where ‘cultural criticism’ means inventing hypothetical children with neurological diseases just to attack taylor”. Another added, “What an utterly bizarre and cruel thing to say, making sweeping ableist statements and attacking Taylor Swift’s unborn children”.The backlash extended beyond Swift’s fanbase. A public health professional warned that presenting CTE as genetic spreads dangerous misinformation, stating, “the suggestion that CTE can be passed from parent to child is dangerous misinformation… & should never have passed review.”Vulture’s decision to delete the link without explanation has only intensified frustration, leaving readers demanding accountability for a piece many believe crossed the line between satire and harm.Also Read: “She doesn’t want to see him”: Taylor Swift refuses Joe Alwyn’s plea for closure as she happily moved on with Travis Kelce","Vulture is facing severe criticism for an article in its 'Stupid Issue' that made ableist and misogynistic remarks, particularly concerning Taylor Swift.

What happened to Keon Coleman and why is the Bills rookie a healthy scratch for the second straight game?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/what-happened-to-keon-coleman-and-why-is-the-bills-rookie-a-healthy-scratch-for-the-second-straight-game/articleshow/125474795.cms,"Buffalo Bills benched rookie receiver Keon Coleman for the second consecutive week due to tardiness, despite team injuries. Coach Sean McDermott emphasized accountability, stating the team's standards remain firm even for talented players. This discipline comes as the Bills face receiver depth issues, highlighting the importance of off-field conduct alongside on-field performance.

Keon Coleman’s discipline issue continues as Bills navigate injuries and reshuffle their receiving group

The Buffalo Bills made headlines once again on Thursday night when wide receiver Keon Coleman was ruled inactive for their matchup against the Houston Texans, a surprising development considering he was fully healthy. For the second straight week, the rookie standout was benched after showing up late to a team meeting before Buffalo’s game against Tampa Bay.Amid the Bills’ playoff push and with injuries piling up at the receiver position, Coleman’s absence became even more noticeable, prompting questions about accountability within the locker room and how coach Sean McDermott plans to balance discipline with the team’s immediate needs. Coleman’s situation highlights how easily a promising season can be derailed if expectations aren’t met on and off the field.Sean McDermott confirmed that Coleman’s benching remained a direct consequence of his tardiness. “He was inactive for last weekend's game against Tampa Bay as punishment,” McDermott said, reiterating that the young receiver must meet the team’s standards. This wasn’t Coleman’s first infraction, he was previously benched for the opening series against New England in Week 5 after being late to another meeting.Coleman’s on-field performance makes the discipline sting even more. With 32 receptions, 330 yards, and three touchdowns this season, he has been one of the more reliable young targets for Buffalo. Yet the Bills chose to maintain their stance, even as they faced depth issues at receiver.Earlier in the day, Buffalo placed recently signed veteran Mecole Hardman on injured reserve after he suffered a calf injury in his team debut. Hardman’s setback removed a key piece of depth the Bills hoped to lean on late in the season. To fill the gaps, the team elevated Gabe Davis and tight end Keleki Latu from the practice squad.Meanwhile, the Texans entered the matchup with their own challenges. Quarterback C.J. Stroud and safety Jalen Pitre were ruled out for a third consecutive game due to concussions, while kicker Ka’imi Fairbairn returned from a quadriceps injury.For the Bills, Coleman’s situation now becomes a test of maturity and discipline. His talent is undeniable, but proving he can uphold team expectations is the next step in his development and Buffalo’s decisions make it clear that the standard won’t bend, even for a rising star.Also Read: Where is Khalil Shakir?

Jackson didn’t hesitate to embrace the long-running fan theory. “I can't not be a Falcon fan, but I cheer most for the Baltimore Ravens because Lamar Jackson is my [bastard] son.

His wife announced the birth, ending fan speculation about his health. Despite the temporary leave for this major life event, Shakir continues his standout season, leading the team in receptions and yards.

Khalil Shakir’s absence explained as family joy takes priority during a milestone moment

Khalil Shakir’s name appearing as a non-participant on the Buffalo Bills’ injury report sparked immediate concern among fans, especially heading into a short Week 12 turnaround. As the team prepared for a crucial matchup against the Houston Texans, Shakir was listed as a DNP on both Monday and Tuesday, an unusual sight for one of Buffalo’s most consistent offensive playmakers.With no injury disclosed and the Bills staying quiet early in the week, speculation quickly spread across social media. But by Tuesday evening, the mystery was solved in the most heartwarming way possible, revealing that Shakir’s absence had nothing to do with health issues and everything to do with a major life milestone.The answer came directly from Shakir’s wife, Sayler, who shared a photo on Instagram announcing the arrival of the couple’s newborn daughter. “11/17/25, Sunny Haven Shakir, you are oh so loved already,” she wrote, instantly making it clear why the Bills’ leading receiver stepped away from the field. The post not only ended the uncertainty but also prompted an outpouring of congratulations from Bills fans and teammates.Shakir becomes the second Bills player this season to welcome a child, joining long snapper Reid Ferguson, who celebrated the birth of his third baby in September. For Shakir, the timing may have pulled him away from practice, but it hasn’t slowed his standout season.Through Buffalo’s first 10 games, he leads the team with 46 receptions and 454 yards, production that reflects both his growing chemistry with Josh Allen and the momentum he has carried into 2025 after signing a long-term extension through 2029.With the Bills returning to practice on Wednesday for their final session before heading to Houston, Shakir is expected back in the building. Whether he sees his full workload on Thursday remains to be seen, but his absence had nothing to do with injury concerns, just the joy of becoming a new father.And for a Buffalo team gearing up for a pivotal stretch, having Shakir’s talent and positive energy back on the field will be welcomed just as warmly as baby Sunny was into the world.Also Read: Russell Wilson and Ciara celebrate a Hollywood milestone as their first major film breaks into the year’s top 100","Khalil Shakir was listed as a non-participant on the Buffalo Bills' injury report on Monday and Tuesday.

Randi Mahomes opens up about tough hike as Chiefs' pressure grows

Randi Mahomes is no stranger to high-energy days, cross-country travel, or the nonstop rhythm that comes with being the mother of one of the NFL’s biggest stars.

After completing a demanding Colorado hike with her daughter, Mia Randall, Randi revealed that the adventure left her barely able to walk, an honest, lighthearted confession that immediately caught attention online.Her post wasn’t a sign of illness or injury, but rather a glimpse into her adventurous spirit and willingness to push herself beyond what’s comfortable. As Patrick Mahomes faces mounting pressure in Kansas City, his mom’s viral moment stood out as a reminder that even the strongest supporters have their own battles, joys, and challenges.Randi’s message on X said it all: “I feel like I’m at top of the world.. almost.. however i may not be able to walk this week. Great hike! 1st real deal hike. #bucketlist.” Her words, paired with a breathtaking summit photo, revealed that she had conquered Boulder’s Royal Arch Trail, a steep, rocky 3.2-mile climb with nearly 900 feet of elevation.The adventure became a full family moment, with Randi later sharing clips of the trek, from trailhead to summit, complete with peanut butter and jelly sandwich breaks and playful flexing with Mia.“It was an absolute blast climbing to the top of Royal Arch with my @miablissss! Cherishing these sweet memories with my girl always ❤️⛰️,” she wrote, capturing the heart behind their mother-daughter getaway.But while Randi enjoyed a rare escape into nature, the atmosphere in Kansas City shifted dramatically.

Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bündchen reflected on the turbulent years when depression and panic attacks took over her life,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-bradys-ex-wife-gisele-bndchen-reflected-on-the-turbulent-years-when-depression-and-panic-attacks-took-over-her-life/articleshow/125465588.cms,"Supermodel Gisele Bündchen revealed her early 20s were plagued by severe panic attacks and depression, a stark contrast to her public image. Constant travel, poor sleep, and unhealthy habits fueled her struggles. A naturopathic doctor's advice to address her lifestyle, including diet and sleep, initiated a profound transformation, leading her to prioritize well-being and share her journey through her cookbook.

How Gisele Bündchen rebuilt her mind and body after hitting her lowest point

In one of her most candid conversations, Gisele Bündchen looked back on a period that many fans never knew she struggled through. Long before she became one of the world’s most recognizable supermodels, Bündchen’s early 20s were marked by overwhelming panic attacks, exhaustion, and what she now recognizes as “severe” depression.In 2024, speaking on The View, she described those years as “one of the worst times in my life,” a stark contrast to the glamorous image the world saw. In retrospect, she realizes the chaos of constant travel, poor sleep, processed food, and relentless pressure created the perfect storm. But what ultimately changed everything and led her toward a healthier life, was finally understanding the connection between her lifestyle and her mental health.During her modeling rise, Bündchen was thrust into independence early, traveling from Brazil to Japan and then to New York while still a teenager. She recalled feeling grateful at the time, but her nonstop schedule gradually became destructive. “I wasn’t really paying attention, I was just going, like a hundred miles an hour,” she told the hosts. She admitted she had “no idea that it was correlated with my lifestyle and food was a big part of it.That realization came only after she sought help and spoke with a naturopathic doctor. When she openly described her daily routine, “I drink, I smoke, I have coffee”, the specialist immediately pointed out the core issue. “He said, ‘Listen… stop right there.’ He says, ‘You’re not sleeping. You’re in different time zones all the time. You’re eating, like, terrible all day.’”What followed was a complete reset. With guidance, she began eating intentionally, getting consistent sleep, and exercising daily. Within about 18 months, she said, “everything changed.” Meditation, yoga, and breath work soon became part of her routine, helping her rebuild her mental and emotional foundation.Two decades later, Bündchen is sharing those lessons through her cookbook Nourish, hoping others won’t wait as long as she did to prioritize their well-being. “Let the food be your medicine,” she said, a simple philosophy born from one of the hardest chapters of her life.Also Read: Why Gisele Bündchen reportedly grew tired of Tom Brady resurfaces in old divorce insights","Supermodel Gisele Bündchen revealed her early 20s were plagued by severe panic attacks and depression.

Antonio Brown’s 5-word Charlie Kirk remark sends shockwaves amid attempted murder case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/antonio-browns-5-word-charlie-kirk-remark-sends-shockwaves-amid-attempted-murder-case/articleshow/125461213.cms,"Antonio Brown's return to the U.S. for extradition on an attempted murder charge was immediately overshadowed by a viral livestream. During the broadcast, he made a controversial remark referencing Charlie Kirk, drawing parallels to his own serious legal situation. Brown faces significant prison time for allegedly firing shots after a boxing event, a stark contrast to his celebrated NFL career.

'Rooftop Blind Spot Left Open': Kirk's Security Chief Reveals Utah Cops Were Warned Of Gaps But...

Antonio Brown’s livestream appearance added fuel to an already high-stakes legal situation

Antonio Brown’s return to the United States in late 2025, following his extradition from Dubai, instantly reignited public attention, not for football, but for the mounting legal turmoil that has reshaped his post-NFL life. The former Pittsburgh Steelers star, once celebrated as one of the most dominant wide receivers of his era, now found himself navigating accusations that threatened to eclipse every highlight of his career.As he reappeared in Miami, still facing an attempted murder charge tied to a disturbing May incident, Brown’s next move wasn’t a press conference or a legal statement. Instead, he jumped straight into an attention-grabbing livestream with Adin Ross, N3On, and rapper 6ix9ine, a decision that would quickly spark another wave of national conversation.During the livestream, Brown delivered the moment that instantly went viral. After joking with Ross, he dropped a line that stunned everyone watching, “Nobody gonna Charlie Kirk me.” Ross’s reaction, “Oh my God”, captured the internet’s collective disbelief as the clip exploded across X. The remark referenced the September shooting of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, creating a jarring parallel to Brown’s own case.Authorities allege Brown grabbed a gun from a security staffer and fired two shots at Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu during a confrontation after Ross’s celebrity boxing event. One bullet reportedly grazed Nantambu’s neck, prompting Brown’s extradition and a potential sentence that could reach 30 years due to firearm enhancements. As Assistant State Attorney Stephanie Cruz noted, Florida’s laws could impose a 20-year mandatory minimum if he is convicted.Rather than distancing himself from controversy, Brown appeared energized by the online attention, playing football on the grass, interacting with streamers, and leaning into the unpredictability that has defined his public persona.Yet behind the viral moment lies a far heavier reality. Brown’s legendary NFL career, 928 catches, more than 12,000 yards, 88 touchdowns, and a Super Bowl ring, now stands in stark contrast to the criminal charges threatening his future. With a hearing scheduled for December 22, the stakes continue to rise, and the football world is watching closely as a once-unstoppable star faces consequences that could change his life forever.Also Read: Ja’Marr Chase’s bizarre excuse for spitting on Jalen Ramsey fuels heated league-wide debate as suspension appeal looms","Antonio Brown's return to the U.S. for extradition on an attempted murder charge was immediately overshadowed by a viral livestream.

“She doesn’t want to see him”: Taylor Swift refuses Joe Alwyn’s plea for closure as she happily moved on with Travis Kelce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/she-doesnt-want-to-see-him-taylor-swift-refuses-joe-alwyns-plea-for-closure-as-she-happily-moved-on-with-travis-kelce/articleshow/125461032.cms,"Nearly two years after their breakup, reports resurfaced detailing Joe Alwyn's desire for a final conversation with Taylor Swift to find closure. However, Swift had already processed her emotions through music and moved on, finding healing and new love with Travis Kelce. Her friends supported her decision to avoid revisiting the past, prioritizing her current stability and future.

Why Taylor Swift chose not to revisit the past despite Joe Alwyn’s request

Nearly two years after Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn ended their long-term relationship, old reports resurfaced describing a quiet emotional divide between the former couple, one that never found a final conversation. At the time, insiders claimed Joe Alwyn was searching for a private and heartfelt sit-down with Swift, hoping to understand the unraveling of their six-year partnership.He reportedly wanted clarity, peace, and the ability to “finally shut the door on the past.” Meanwhile, Swift had already begun channeling her heartbreak into music and transitioning toward a very different chapter of her life, one that would eventually include Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce.Back in early 2025, sources close to Alwyn described a man still sorting through unresolved emotions. Though the actor publicly maintained that the breakup was “a hard thing to navigate,” he continued to process unanswered questions behind the scenes. For him, closure seemed tied to one more conversation with the woman he once expected to build a future with.For Swift, however, the healing process had already taken shape through artistry, reflection, and new love.Insiders at the time said she felt no need to revisit the breakup face-to-face, believing that distance was healthier for everyone involved. “She expressed her feelings in her album and got a lot out of her system,” one source shared, emphasizing that reconnecting with Alwyn would only open emotional wounds she had already worked hard to close.Her friends reportedly supported that choice, especially as her budding romance with Travis Kelce began to reshape her life. Their relationship rapidly became one of the year’s most-watched celebrity stories, and Swift’s inner circle felt revisiting an old chapter could derail the stability she had found. As one insider put it, “She wishes him well, but she doesn’t want to see him.”While Joe Alwyn continued focusing on his acting career, whether he ever found the closure he hoped for remains unclear. What was clear even then, though, was that Taylor Swift had already moved firmly into her next era, one defined by creative freedom, emotional clarity, and a future centered around Travis Kelce rather than the past she chose to leave behind.Also Read: ""Blake misses her"": Taylor Swift and Blake Lively rumored to be reconnecting as legal tensions fade and her wedding with Travis Kelce nears","Joe Alwyn reportedly wanted a final conversation with Taylor Swift to find closure.

On Wednesday night, he reshared the post to his Instagram Stories with the caption, “Tell swift put me on a song RIGHT NOW.”Swifties had a strong reaction to this post, and some even called the move disrespectful.

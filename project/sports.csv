Why Team India came to Manchester from London via train and walked in rain

In a major development, the organisers of the World Championship of Legends (WCL) have officially called off the much-anticipated India vs Pakistan fixture, issuing a public apology for hurting public sentiment and causing discomfort to Indian cricket legends.In a formal statement, WCL said the decision to schedule an India-Pakistan game was inspired by a recent friendly volleyball encounter between the two nations, aimed at creating ""happy memories"" for fans.However, the organisers admitted that the announcement ended up ""hurting the feelings of many"" and caused unease among Indian players. “We deeply regret the emotional distress caused and apologise for the inconvenience,” WCL said, confirming that the match has been scrapped.The move follows strong resistance from Indian cricketers. Former India cricketer Shikhar Dhawan shared a statement on social media platform X, reaffirming his decision to not play against Pakistan. He also posted an email he had sent to WCL organisers on May 11, clearly communicating his refusal to participate due to the prevailing geopolitical tensions.“Jo kadam 11 May ko liya, uspe aaj bhi waise hi khada hoon. Mera desh mere liye sab kuch hai, aur desh se badhkar kuch nahi hota (I stand by the decision I took on May 11.My country is everything to me, and nothing is above the nation),” Dhawan wrote. Suresh Raina also echoed the same stance, while sources suggest that other Indian legends had privately communicated similar concerns to the organisers.Adding to the chorus, WCL sponsor EaseMyTrip issued a strong statement distancing itself from any fixture involving Pakistan. “Despite entering into a 5-year sponsorship agreement, EaseMyTrip will not associate with or participate in any WCL match involving Pakistan,” the travel-tech portal said. The company reiterated its full support to the India Champions and emphasised, “Bharat First. Always.”WCL 2025, sanctioned by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), is set to run from July 18 to August 2 at four UK venues - Birmingham, Northampton, Leicester, and Leeds - with retired international stars participating.",World Championship of Legends (WCL) has officially called off the much- anticipated India vs Pakistan fixture.

He took five wickets in the two games.Last season, the Karnal-born pacer created history after he became only the third cricketer after Bengal’s Premangsu Chatterjee (1956–57) and Rajasthan’s Pradeep Sundaram (1985–86) to take all ten wickets in an innings in the Ranji Trophy.Kamboj burst onto the scene when he took 17 wickets in ten games and helped Haryana lift the Vijay Hazare Trophy in 2023. On the back of that performance, he bagged an IPL contract with Mumbai Indians and played three games.In IPL 2025, the Haryana seamer was part of the Chennai Super Kings outfit.

In a Vitality Blast match at Trent Bridge, Nottinghamshire defeated Lancashire despite early struggles. The game stood out for exceptional performances from 17-year-old Farhan Ahmed , who took a hat-trick and five wickets, and Tom Moores, who scored a match-winning 75 runs. Lancashire were bowled out for 126, but Notts initially struggled before securing victory with 28 balls remaining.The young sensation Farhan Ahmed has continued his remarkable rise in cricket. Last season, he became Britain's youngest player to take ten wickets in a first-class match. His five-wicket haul, including a hat-trick in the final three balls, proved crucial in restricting Lancashire.Lancashire's innings started promisingly with 38 runs from 19 balls. However, their momentum quickly faded as Notts' spinners, including Farhan and Patterson-White, struck early. The batting side tumbled to 53 for 5 in eight overs. A 62-run partnership between Matty Hurst (36) and Chris Green (29) provided some resistance but wasn't enough.Notts' chase got off to a shaky start. They were reeling at 14 for 4 after Tom Hartley's double strike in the second over.Then came Tom Moores' game-changing innings. He smashed 75 off 42 balls, forming a crucial 81-run partnership with Lyndon James (20). Despite Moores' run-out near the end, Notts reached their target of 127 with plenty of balls to spare.The victory was bittersweet for Nottinghamshire. Their poor net run rate meant they missed the quarter-finals for the third time in four seasons. Meanwhile, Lancashire had already secured their quarter-final spot, maintaining their unique record of reaching the T20 knockout stages for eight consecutive seasons.",Nottinghamshire defeated Lancashire in a Vitality Blast match at Trent Bridge. 17-year-old Farhan Ahmed took a hat-trick and five wickets for Notts.

Poll Who do you think will win the series? India England

In a striking assessment of the ongoing India-England Test series, former England captains Nasser Hussain and Michael Atherton have likened the drama and intensity of the five-match contest to the legendary 2005 Ashes. With England leading 2-1 and two Tests remaining, both cricket pundits believe the series is brewing into something special - tense, dramatic, and unforgettable.Speaking on the Sky Sports Cricket Podcast, Hussain didn’t mince words: ""You have got it as the next 2005 Ashes."" The tight finish at Lord’s - where India fell short by 22 runs despite Ravindra Jadeja ’s heroics and Mohammed Siraj ’s gritty resistance - brought back vivid memories of the Edgbaston epic from 2005. Then, too, the Test ended with heartbreak for the visitors and a quiet show of sportsmanship between battered warriors.""Well, actually, there was a similarity that struck me when Siraj went down on his haunches at the end,"" said Atherton, recalling how English players, including Zak Crawley and Joe Root, came over to console Siraj. ""There were some similarities,"" he added, pointing to that emotional Flintoff-Lee moment at Edgbaston two decades ago.Hussain emphasised the ""bit of niggle"" and ""evenly matched"" nature of the sides, saying: ""There’s now a bit of tension in the series and still all to play for.""One such flashpoint came during Day 3 at Lord’s when Crawley and Duckett tried to slow things down before stumps. India responded aggressively, leading to an on-field flare-up that saw Siraj shouting in Duckett’s face the next day after dismissing him.""I think Siraj is a better cricketer when he is fired up,"" Hussain noted. ""You would love to have Siraj in your side. I didn’t think he should have been fined. He went close to the line - but didn’t cross it. It’s a game of emotion. You don’t need 22 robots.""Atherton, meanwhile, believes this bubbling tension will only enrich the remainder of the series. ""That’s the beauty of a five-Test match series - it allows subplots, personal rivalries and animosities to develop. They wouldn’t be forgetting what was said on the field.""With matches at Old Trafford and The Oval still to come, the battle is far from over - but one thing is certain: the fire is well and truly lit.",Former England captains Nasser Hussain and Michael Atherton have likened the India-England Test series to the legendary 2005 Ashes.

Poll Should Karun Nair be replaced in the playing eleven for the fourth Test? Yes, he should be replaced No, he should be given another chance

Former India wicketkeeper Farokh Engineer has expressed concerns over Karun Nair's performance in the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, highlighting the batsman's inability to convert promising starts into substantial scores for the Shubman Gill-led Indian team, with pressure mounting for his spot in the playing eleven ahead of the fourth Test in Manchester starting July 23.Nair's current form in the series has been a matter of concern, managing only 131 runs across six innings at an average of 21.83, with his highest score being 40 in the first innings of the third Test at Lord's.The team's failure to chase down a target of 193 at Lord's has put additional scrutiny on the batting lineup, particularly on Nair's position at number three.""Karun Nair has been getting brilliant 20s and 30s. He's (Nair) scored beautiful 30 runs, beautiful cover drives and all that. But a beautiful 30 is not expected from a No. 3. You've got to get a not-so-beautiful 100. You need runs on the board. You need (to score) bigger. The expectation should be much higher,"" Engineer told TimesofIndia.com.Sai Sudharsan, who played in the first Test at Headingley at number three position, showed promise despite getting out for a duck in the first innings and scoring 30 runs in the second innings before being dismissed.Also Read: A Thursday with Farokh Engineer: Of BBQ, Sachin Tendulkar's Old Trafford hundred and the wait for Sunil Gavaskar The team management opted to drop Sudharsan for the second Test, prioritizing bowling options by including all-rounders Nitish Kumar Reddy and Washington Sundar ""We should pick the best XI.

England level series after rain-hit win

Controversy unfolded at Lord’s during the second Women’s ODI between India and England, that tipped in the hosts' favour this time around following a win for India in the 1st. In the fifth over of England’s innings, Deepti Sharma bowled a fuller delivery to Tammy Beaumont . The English opener drove it towards Jemimah Rodrigues at short midwicket. Rodrigues dove to her right, stopped the ball, and threw it back towards wicketkeeper Richa Ghosh.Beaumont, whocut short her run after opting against a quick single, was walking back to the crease. After placing her left foot inside the crease, with her right leg, she appeared to attempt kicking the ball away. Though she didn’t make contact, it appeared that she had tried to stop the ball with her foot before it reached Ghosh.The visitors appealed without fail, gesturing to the umpires that Beaumont had tried to interfere with the throw. The umpires had a long discussion and opted for a review. After watching a few replays, the third umpire decided Beaumont was not out.However, according to the laws, there is no exemption that protects a batter from being given out for Obstructing the Field even if they are back inside the crease. The ball was still in play at the time, which is clear from the fact that it was moving towards the India wicketkeeper.Additionally, it has been mentioned in another clause that the batter will not be out if they Obstruct the field accidentally, to avoid injury or in the case of a second/subsequent strike made to guard the wicket lawfully (for a striker).However, the not out decision didn’t hurt India much in terms of runs conceded, given that Beaumont was batting on 25 off 16 balls at the time and was later dismissed for 34 off 35 by Sneh Rana in the 11th over.In the match itself, England bounced back to win the second ODI by eight wickets in a rain-shortened game at Lord’s.

Poll Do you believe there was ever a genuine rift between Ashwin and Harbhajan? Yes, definitely No, it was all speculation Not sure

Former India off-spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Harbhajan Singh confronted each other about their careers, rivalry, and the jealousy factor that reportedly created a rift between the duo.Over the years, comparisons between Ashwin and fellow Indian spin legend Harbhajan Singh were frequent. Speculation about a rift between the two spinners has often surfaced, suggesting strained relations.In the explosive teaser of Season 3 of Kutti Stories with Ash, India's two great spinners can be seen clearing the air about the speculated rift between them.""This whole jealousy bit. Before I allow you to answer that, let me clarify something. People look at everything from their perspective. For example, if they are passing a comment on me, they believe that others would see the world through their eyes. This comment that you are jealous of this person who is interviewing you today — what would that..."" Ashwin asked Harbhajan.Harbhajan replied, ""Do you think I am jealous of you? You are sitting with me today, and we have spoken at length. Do you think I am that kind of person?""Ashwin, in a very nonchalant way, replied, ""Even if you are jealous at one point, it is justified. That is my point. I would never take it the wrong way because we are all human.Naturally, it is bound to be like that.""Ashwin also cleared the air about his retirement.""Some people believe I retired because of Washington Sundar. He is in the thick of things now. All of this is the perspective of others,"" he said.Ashwin picked up 765 wickets in international cricket in 379 innings, while Harbhajan scalped 707 wickets in his illustrious career.After Ashwin's retirement from Test cricket, Harbhajan had already dispelled such rumours, asserting that there is no truth to claims of discord between them.""I read social media only as much as I need to. If there is a standoff between me and Ashwin, or if there was ever any fight, quarrel or disagreement, I would be the first person to go up to him and ask what the issue is,"" Harbhajan Singh said on his YouTube channel.""But it was never like this, and it will never be like this, because whatever is in his destiny, he will get it, and I got whatever was in my destiny.

NEW DELHI: In the wake of India’s contrasting fortunes under Gautam Gambhir across formats, former India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh has advocated for a split-coaching system, suggesting that separate coaches for red-ball and white-ball cricket could be beneficial for the national team.Gambhir, who took charge as India’s head coach following the T20 World Cup 2024, has found early success in the shorter formats. India clinched the ICC Champions Trophy under him and have recorded 13 wins and two defeats in T20Is since he took over. However, the same success has eluded the team in Tests, where they are currently trailing 1-2 in the five-match series against England, following a whitewash by New Zealand and a series defeat to Australia.Speaking to India Today, Harbhajan Singh made a compelling case for format-specific coaching roles.""I feel if it can be implemented, there is nothing wrong in it. You have different teams and different players for formats. If we can do it, it’s a good option. It will reduce workload for everyone, including the coaches,"" Harbhajan said.He further explained that even coaches require time and mental space to prepare adequately for different formats, and managing all three consistently can be overwhelming.""Your coach also needs time to prepare for a series. Like five Tests against Australia, then in England, then elsewhere. So the coach can prepare and set out what his team should be. The same goes for a white-ball coach. He will need time to prepare as well,"" he added.Highlighting the personal toll coaching can take, he emphasised: ""If you overwork one coach for the whole year, he, too, has a family and responsibilities. Traveling constantly with family isn’t easy. So yes, if you ask me, splitting red-ball and white-ball coaching is a good move.""","Gautam Gambhir has found early success in the shorter formats. India clinched the ICC Champions Trophy under him and have recorded 13 wins and two defeats in T20Is since he took over.

Poll What aspect of Shubman Gill's performance is most crucial for India's success in the fourth Test? Batting performance Captaincy and leadership Fielding and tactics

India may have lost the third Test at Lord’s in a tight finish, but the team remains hopeful ahead of the fourth match at Old Trafford, starting July 23. A key figure under focus is captain Shubman Gill , who has impressed with both the bat and his leadership.Despite a quiet outing at Lord’s, where he scored just 16 and 6, former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar feels Gill has what it takes to bounce back in Manchester.Looking back at Gill's display in the previous Test, Manjrekar said, ""His role is important, but India will also reflect on the fact that in the third Test match at Lord's, there was no contribution from Gill with the bat. Despite that, India's batting line-up still managed to challenge England. So, that's a good takeaway - we are not completely dependent on Gill.""Gill came into the Lord’s Test on the back of three centuries in the series, including a career-best 269. He has scored 607 runs so far, with two Tests left in the series.Manjrekar believes the break between matches will help Gill reset. ""I believe he has the ability to carry forward his form,he told JioHotstar.Referring to the captain’s mindset, Manjrekar added,During this break, perhaps with some introspection and conversations with his friends and father about the recent altercation. He just needs to focus on his captaincy, fielding, tactics, and batting. If he does that, I believe the run-making machine that was once in motion is well-oiled and will start running again at Old Trafford.""India trail the five-match series 2-1, making the fourth Test in Manchester a must-win to stay in contention.","Shubman Gill has impressed with both the bat and his leadership.

Poll What do you think is the biggest issue in international cricket today? Players prioritizing domestic leagues Unequal distribution of funds among cricket boards Lack of loyalty to national teams

International cricket as a whole, has its own flaws and challenges. From players preferring to focus their careers on domestic leagues and competitions across countries over donning the jersey of the national team, to stars retiring early from international duty, the current scenario is far from ideal. In an earnest discussion about the current state of the sport, cricket legends Brian Lara Alastair Cook , David Lloyd, Phil Tufnell and Michael Vaughan debated what could potentially fix the current predicament.Speaking on the ""Stick to Cricket"" podcast, the legends mulled over what the most 'annoying' thing in the modern game is at the moment, with all of them taking turns. ""That playing for your country isn't the biggest thing,"" said Cook, eliciting sharp reactions from the rest of the legends. Brian Lara sided with the former England skipper.In a long rant about how the money is not shared equally between the various cricket boards across the world, Vaughan said, ""I think the thing that annoys me most about the game is the pie's not split right. There's so much money in the ICC. Seriously, that's wrong. That is my biggest frustration. If we want to get to a stage—and it might be two tiers of cricket—the only way that's going to be fair is if the pie’s—I'm not saying it has to be exactly the same—but the likes of the West Indies, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, New Zealand—they've got to get more of the pie.The legend argued that paying players better will directly result in them playing for their countries for a longer period of time. A recent instance of the same could be seen in the retirement of Nicholas Pooran, aged 29 from international cricket.""So you can pay your players a nicer sum of money that they will stay playing for their country for longer. That's my biggest bugbear,"" exclaimed Vaughan.On the same, Lara said, ""The truth is, I don't think the West Indies Cricket Board or the administration has done anything meaningful to keep players loyal to West Indies cricket, unlike what boards in countries like England, Australia, or even India have done.""","Cricket legends Alastair Cook, David Lloyd, Phil Tufnell and Michael Vaughan debated what could potentially fix the current predicament.

Why Team India came to Manchester from London via train and walked in rain

England bounced back strongly in the second Women’s ODI, easing past India by eight wickets in a rain-affected clash at Lord’s on Saturday. Opener Amy Jones led the way with an unbeaten 46, helping the hosts chase down a revised target of 115 with ease to level the three-match series 1-1.After India’s dominant chase of 259 in the first ODI, their batting faltered in the second as they posted a modest 143/8 in the 29-overs-a-side contest. Smriti Mandhana top-scored with 42, but found little support from the rest of the batting lineup.England’s chase began smoothly, with Jones and Tammy Beaumont (34 off 35) adding 54 for the opening stand. Off-spinner Sneh Rana broke the partnership by trapping Beaumont lbw with a reverse sweep gone wrong. Jones then combined with skipper Nat Sciver-Brunt (21) to take the hosts within 42 runs of victory before rain interrupted play.When action resumed, England’s revised DLS target was 115 in 24 overs. Though Kranti Gaud bowled a peach to dismiss Sciver-Brunt, the result was never in doubt. Sophie Dunkley sealed the win with a boundary in the 21st over, completing a dominant performance from the home side.A minimum of 20 overs was required for a result, and the Lord’s ground staff worked swiftly to ensure enough overs were bowled for DLS to come into play—ensuring the match didn’t end in a no-result.Earlier, India never got going with the bat. After losing debutant opener Pratika Rawal in the second over to Em Arlott (2/26), Mandhana and Harleen Deol (16) added 40 for the second wicket to steady the innings.However, Deol’s dismissal—caught and bowled by Sophie Ecclestone—triggered a collapse. The left-arm spinner was once again England’s standout, claiming 3/27 as India lost four wickets for just 26 runs in the middle phase. Mandhana, who had earlier been dropped on two, was eventually dismissed for 42, chipping Linsey Smith (2/28) to Charlie Dean inside the circle.At 98/6, India were staring at a sub-120 total, but Deepti Sharma (30*) and Arundhati Reddy (14) added 26 crucial runs for the seventh wicket to give the score some respectability. However, Reddy’s dismissal ended that resistance, and India fell well short of a par score.The third and final ODI will now be played in Durham on July 22, with everything to play for.","England beat India by eight wickets in second Women's ODI at Lord's.

Why Team India came to Manchester from London via train and walked in rain

Arshdeep’s bowling hand well protected

The Indian cricket team arrived in Manchester via train this afternoon and was greeted by a steady drizzle. The team, however, took a last-minute U-turn and didn’t take the planned route of exiting the platform where the train had arrived.They instead snuck out from a back door, and the players were made to walk 300m, mostly in the rain, to board the team bus. Captain Shubman Gill was spotted with the team as others rushed into the bus because of the rain.India stayed back in London after the heartbreak at Lord's and even had a training session in Beckenham. Every player except KL Rahul was in attendance, and while the likes of Rishabh Pant , Akash Deep, and Mohammed Siraj took it easy, the rest operated at full intensity.There was a cause for concern as Arshdeep Singh, who is yet to play a game, injured his bowling hand.The side will now begin preparations at the Old Trafford Ground in Manchester with sessions tomorrow, the day after, and on the eve of the match.The first session will be behind closed doors without any access to the media, just like it happened for two sessions in Birmingham, and doors will be opened for the morning session on July 21 and the afternoon hit on July 22.The Indian team will find the city very pleasant compared to London as it is much cooler and there has been consistent drizzle for the last few days. Even the match days have forecasts of rain, but it hasn't been threatening so far.An odd spell of light showers here and there shouldn’t really be a cause for major concern. The weather, however, can play funny tricks in England, and Manchester is unlikely to be any different in the coming week.Arshdeep Singh, who got hit in the nets, got stitches on his bowling hand and is unlikely to be available for selection for the fourth Test. He travelled with the rest of the team to Manchester but will find it tough to be ready for Old Trafford. It is understood that Arshdeep received the stitches on the day he was hit in the nets.“We have to see how bad the cut is,” said India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate.“Obviously, the medical team is taking him to see a doctor. And whether he needs stitches or not is going to be important to our planning for the next few days,” he added.The fourth Test between India and England will be played at Old Trafford in Manchester, starting July 23.","The Indian cricket team arrived in Manchester via train this afternoon.

Poll Do you believe Arsenal will maintain their dominance in women's football with this signing? Definitely Maybe, but it's not guaranteed No, other teams are catching up

Arsenal have completed a historic £1 million transfer of Canadian forward Olivia Smith from Liverpool, marking the first seven-figure transfer in women's football. The 20-year-old's move to the European champions surpasses the previous record of £900,000 paid by Chelsea for American defender Naomi Girma from San Diego Wave in January.The milestone transfer comes 44 years after Trevor Francis became the first male player to command a million-pound fee when he moved from Birmingham City to Nottingham Forest in 1979. Arsenal secured Smith's services after successful negotiations with Liverpool, who initially were reluctant to let go of their player of the season.""It's my dream to compete for the biggest titles here in England and in Europe and I'm excited to get started and contribute to doing that here with Arsenal,"" Smith said in a statement.Smith demonstrated her value at Liverpool last season, scoring nine goals and earning the club's player of the season award despite the team's struggles. Her versatility allows her to play both as a forward and on the wing, making her an attractive signing for Arsenal.Arsenal's director of women's football, Clare Wheatley, expressed enthusiasm about the signing: ""We're thrilled to bring Olivia to Arsenal. She's one of the most talented young players in the game and has huge potential for further development here.""Smith's journey in football began with her becoming the youngest player to represent Canada at age 15. She then moved to Sporting Lisbon in 2023, where she scored 16 goals in 28 games before joining Liverpool.""It's a privilege and an honor to sign for Arsenal. The atmosphere the supporters create at Emirates Stadium is incredible and I can't wait to have that behind me now,"" Smith stated.The transfer represents Arsenal's ambition to strengthen their position in women's football, following their Champions League victory. The club, which holds the distinction of being the most decorated in English women's football, has also secured the services of winger Chloe Kelly, Taylor Hinds, and Anneke Borbe on free transfers for the upcoming season.Liverpool, who finished seventh last season, plan to use the transfer fee to reinforce their squad. The record-breaking transfer signifies Arsenal's intent to maintain their dominance in the league while setting a new benchmark for women's football transfers.The transfer marks a significant moment in the development of women's football, establishing a new financial milestone that reflects the growing investment and commercial value in the women's game.

PANAJI: Three months after the All India Football Federation (AIFF) declared Churchill Brothers FC as the I-League winners and hastily handed over the trophy during a ceremony in Goa, the federation announced Inter Kashi FC as the new champions on Friday.The announcement follows orders from the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), after the Switzerland-based tribunal set aside the AIFF appeals committee decision, which had adjudged that the re-registration of Mario Barco by the Varanasi-based club made him an ineligible player. Points were forfeited following a protest by three clubs – Churchill Brothers, Namdhari and Real Kashmir -- leaving them lower in the table.The CAS panel, an independent international body that settles disputes related to sport through arbitration, however set aside the appeals committee decision issued on May 31 and ordered AIFF to “adjust the points table of the I-League and declare Inter Kashi as champions.”The final points table leaves Kashi at the top with 42 points, two more than second-placed Churchill.Real Kashmir finished third with 37 points.“We won on the pitch, fair and square, but many could not accept that,” said club president Prithijit Das. “Our club is barely two years old, which played the I-League with heart and grit. Maybe because we weren’t part of the old order, false cases were filed, our integrity questioned, our name dragged. We didn’t give up. We went all the way to CAS, fought steadily, and won.”Significantly, this was the second win for Kashi at CAS in as many months after the Swiss body had previously overturned the appeals committee decision of taking away three points that were awarded by the disciplinary committee as Namdhari fielded an ineligible player (Cledson da Silva)“This win is not just ours. It’s a reminder of what sport should stand for; passion, fairness, and honesty, not politics,” said Das.AIFF was quick to readjust the league points table and officially declare Kashi as the new champions.“CAS has ruled that the AIFF shall declare Inter Kashi as winners of the I-League 2024-25. The AIFF congratulates Inter Kashi on being adjudged champions,” AIFF said in a statement.With the CAS order and AIFF’s statement, the I-League title race has now finally concluded, more than three months after the teams had played the last round of matches. On the final day, Churchill had their chances to settle the race on the ground itself but only ended up drawing 1-1 against Real Kashmir in Srinagar.Kashi, who were almost out of the race, turned the standings on its head after scoring twice in four stoppage-time minutes for a 3-1 win against Rajasthan United. The players celebrated at their home ground, believing they had come from behind not just for a win but also a memorable triumph.“It was a very difficult time for everyone at the club but in the end, victory is ours. We have won not just the I-League title, but our name and respect as well,” said Das.","Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) overturns AIFF decision to declare Churchill Brothers the I-League champions. Kashi FC are now the new champions of the Indian Premier League. The final points table leaves Kashi at the top with 42 points, two more than second-placed Churchill.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122777780,imgsize-212032,width-400,resizemode-4/122777780.jpg"

Why was the ban imposed in first place?

Poll What is your main concern regarding the return of away fans? Increased violence and incidents Allocation of police resources General public safety

Argentina's football federation has announced plans to gradually lift a 12-year ban on away fans in local leagues, which was originally implemented to curb stadium violence but proved ineffective.The first test of this new policy will occur during the Clausura tournament's second matchday when Lanús hosts Rosario Central.""It's a day that marks a before and after in our league,"" Argentine Football Association president Claudio Tapia said. ""It's the kind of football (with visitors) we all grew accustomed to since we were kids. We have to get back to that path. Clubs that are in a position to host visiting fans can do so.""The ban was initiated in 2013 following two tragic incidents: a Lanús fan's death during a police intervention in a clash with Estudiantes supporters, and the deaths of two Boca Juniors fans in a faction-related shootout.The restriction began in Buenos Aires province before expanding nationwide. However, violence persisted with continued deaths among ""barrabravas"" groups.Under the new protocol, 6,500 Rosario Central supporters will be permitted in the Lanús away section. The plan includes strict security measures and designated tickets for proper fan identification.""The idea isn't to go back to what we had before because the visitors were kicked out for a reason,"" Buenos Aires security minister Javier Alonso said. ""We have to eradicate the culture of violence. It's sad to see 10-year-olds singing about drugs or that someone needs to be killed. It has to be a family celebration, with flags and drums.""The initial implementation will be limited to Buenos Aires province, though other provinces have expressed interest in joining the initiative.The plan has faced opposition from some quarters in Buenos Aires. Critics argue that allocating police resources to protect visiting fans could compromise general public security amid rising crime concerns.The away fan restriction only applied to professional league matches and other divisions in Argentina, while international tournaments like Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana continued to allow visiting supporters.""This is what football fans and society want. Many matches have been organised with two sets of fans, and that's why we decided to announce the start of the return of visiting fans,"" Tapia added.",Argentina's football federation has announced plans to gradually lift a 12-year ban on away fans in local leagues.

After 17 unforgettable years, I'm retiring from professional football with deep gratitude and pride,"" Aditi wrote in a social media post on Thursday.""This game gave me more than just a career; it gave me an identity. From chasing a dream in Delhi to carving out my own path all the way to the UK, where I pursued my Master's in Sports Management and played for West Ham United – I walked a road with no clear map.""I never had to choose between education and passion. I fought hard to do both, and that balance has defined me.""Aditi represented India 57 times and was part of three SAFF Women's Championship winning teams in 2012, 2016, and 2019.""I gave everything to the game — my focus, my fire, my body — all in pursuit of that No. 1 jersey for India.

She further wrote.""And then, the injuries. Coming back not once, but twice from ACL injuries, I believe I set an example for other players that one could overcome anything with mental courage. The pain, the doubt, the silence - it was a battle I had to win from within.""Her European journey included two seasons with West Ham before she returned to India in 2018.She later joined Gokulam Kerala FC, winning two Indian Women's League titles in 2019-20 and 2021-22.""What I'm most proud of as a professional athlete is the consistency. Across 17 years, I kept coming back, through setbacks, through injuries, through every doubt, and earned the No. 1 spot time and again.""""My parents stood by me, picked me up when I needed, pushed me when I slacked a bit. Everything that I am, the things I've been able to achieve have been possible because of my mom, who's quietly just ridden this crazy ride with me and I can't thank god enough for giving her as my mom.""In her final season, she played for Sribhumi FC, helping the Kolkata team secure third place in the IWL.""As I now step into life beyond the pitch, I carry that belief with me – not as a player anymore, but as someone committed to building a stronger pathway and ecosystem for the next generation.""My second half is about giving back to the game that gave me everything.""The formula remains the same: dream big, believe in yourself, and put in the work.""","Aditi Chauhan, the first Indian woman to play professional football in Europe, has announced her retirement after a 17-year career.

It’s not unusual for teams to introduce new designs for special Formula E races, be it for livery or driver suits. While Nissan’s cherry blossom livery at the Tokyo E-Prix was a hit and now NEOM McLaren will be racing in a striking white and blue livery, the Lola Yamaha ABT team did something absolutely unexpected at the Berlin E-Prix. Drivers Lucas Di Grassi and Zane Maloney literally wore Superman bodysuits for the race at the Tempelhof Airport Circuit. And just one glimpse of the same wouldn’t be enough.Ahead of the Berlin race, Lucas Di Grassi shared some interesting pictures to introduce his Superman bodysuit. He was seen jumping up in the air while sporting the bodysuit. He captioned it, “No CGI or AI involved. Driver was ok(ish) after the jumps.”A fan wrote, “Even the suit is made as Superman! Man, I love this season.” Another called it, “Sensacional!” A fan also praised “The verticality” in the picture.Lola Yamaha ABT had introduced him and Zane Maloney with the caption: “The beacons of hope. @zane.maloney and @lucasdigrassi are wearing bespoke race suits in a specially wrapped car this weekend, to celebrate our partnership with @warnerbrosde and the new Superman movie. Up, up and away!”The drivers posed enthusiastically on their Formula E Gen3 Evo cars and even jumped from them to get some perfect pictures to suit the Superman theme.However, Lola Yamaha ABT didn’t have a very good race at the Tempelhof Circuit. Lucas Di Grassi suffered a crash in FP3. Neither of the two drivers could bring in any points for the team. Di Grassi finished 18th and 12th in the Round 13 and Round 14 races, respectively. His teammate Zane Maloney finished 16th and 18th in the two races at the double-header.After the race, Di Grassi shared a post on Instagram in which he wrote, “We are one… team.

He had held third place in the Formula E Driver Standings for a long time but has now slipped to fourth. NEOM McLaren’s Taylor Barnard delivered a strong performance in Berlin and replaced Da Costa in the top three.

Those who support me through the good times, but mostly the bad… you guys who are tireless and show me how strong our Portuguese race is.”He further added, “The dream of the championship ended last week, I dreamed, I dreamed big and so did you. Apparently it was the year of “2nd places”. Seems like I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time too often. 3 wins lost in the last laps because of safety cars, a few mistakes my mixture, the season could have been so different, but that's what it is in sport, and the bad moments, if used well, are the best thing we have.

Oliver Rowland’s journey in Formula E was full of ups and downs

Oliver Rowland shares his happiness on Formula E championship win

Things weren’t always well-planned for Oliver Rowland, who has just clinched the Formula E World Championship. The 32-year-old Nissan driver took major risks throughout his career, including walking away from a team without another offer in hand. He describes that time as one of the toughest periods of his life. But Rowland eventually bounced back, joining a new team and going on to win the championship this season.Oliver Rowland made his one-race debut in Formula E with Mahindra Racing at the 2015 Punta del Este ePrix, replacing the injured Nick Heidfeld. He quickly disappeared from the scene afterward.Reflecting on that strange start in Formula E’s second season, Rowland told Formula E’s official website, “If you go back to Punta del Este, I remember having no idea about anything when I arrived and leaving thinking, ‘I'm not sure I want to do that again, because it was pretty tough.’”He eventually returned as a full-time Formula E driver with Nissan e.dams in 2018. After delivering notable performances over a few seasons, he switched to Mahindra Racing in 2021. However, midway through the 2023 season, Rowland made another bold move — quitting the team without a confirmed offer elsewhere. Nissan brought him back the following season, leading to two remarkable years that culminated in him winning the Season 11 championship.Speaking about his decision to leave Mahindra Racing in 2023 after two seasons, Rowland said, “I took a huge risk for my career and for my family because my contract is what keeps us all fed and watered, so walking away from that was a really, really tough period in my life. I remember not sleeping for like, two, three weeks at some point. To kind of write the story and come out on the other side with the team that I started in Formula E with is just perfect. ”He added, “As a racing driver, a lot of days are bad, and you have to keep believing in yourself — that you're capable of doing it. Going into this year, I was confident that we would have a good chance.”Now, Oliver Rowland has become the Formula E World Champion in just his second year back with Nissan. “The moment I arrived in the championship and looked at the caliber of drivers here and the previous World Champions, it's such a good achievement for me to become World Champion. To be part of that is incredible,” he said.Also Read: Oliver Rowland’s rise to champion: Rare childhood moments highlighted in touching video Rowland will now race in front of his home crowd in London, where he’ll lift the World Championship trophy.

How Taylor Barnard surpassed Antonio Felix Da Costa in Driver Standings

This is 21-year-old Taylor Barnard’s first full-fledged season as a rookie driver, and the NEOM McLaren racer has achieved what many of his peers couldn’t. At the recently held Berlin E-Prix, Barnard put up a strong performance on the track, managing to surpass Antonio Felix Da Costa and take the third spot in the standings. With two races remaining, Barnard still has a chance to overtake Pascal Wehrlein for the second place.Taylor Barnard outperformed TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix Da Costa in Berlin. Da Costa, who had been comfortably sitting in third, has now slipped to fourth in the standings.Taking to Instagram to reflect on his Berlin performance, Barnard wrote, “Reflecting on Berlin. Definitely a weekend of what could have been, but we scored good points across both races, closing the gap to P2 in the standings. An unfortunately timed SC on Sunday cost us the chance of going for the win, but we will maximise our efforts to go into London as strong as possible.Taylor Barnard finished fourth in Round 13 and sixth in Round 14 race at the Berlin E-Prix, collecting a total of 20 points. In comparison, Da Costa finished 10th and 8th in the two races, scoring just 5 points — enabling Barnard to leap ahead of him in the standings.Currently, Oliver Rowland has sealed the Formula E Championship title with 184 points.Pascal Wehrlein holds second place with 125 points, while Barnard trails closely behind with 112. A strong performance in London could be enough for Barnard to overtake Wehrlein and claim second place in the championship.So far this season, Barnard has secured five podium finishes — one each in Sao Paulo, Tokyo, and Shanghai, and two in Jeddah — though he is yet to clinch his first Formula E race win.Barnard will now race on home soil in London alongside his McLaren teammate Sam Bird. The duo will sport a new blue-and-white livery and race suits.

Oliver Rowland was worried after how Round 13 turned out in Berlin

Formula E Berlin Round 14 – 60‑Second Blitz!

Pascal Wehrlein’s Round 14 performance sealed Oliver Rowland’s championship win

Oliver Rowland looking forward to his home race now



Oliver Rowland’s fans kept their fingers crossed and waited with bated breath for the Nissan driver to seal his Formula E World Championship at the Round 13 race in Berlin on Saturday. But the day ended on a sad note for the driver as he failed to even finish the race, while his closest competitor, Pascal Wehrlein, clinched second spot on the podium, closing the gap between them in the Formula E Driver Standings. Rowland has confirmed that he did doubt his championship win when things didn’t play out well that day.There was reason to be worried for Nissan driver Oliver Rowland when TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein closed the gap between them in the Driver Standings to 50 points. He was second in the Formula E Driver Standings and could have changed the championship outcome with two more races remaining in the season.Sharing his fears in an interview with Formula E, he said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday) I was more worried that it might never come.”Pascal Wehrlein ended 15th in the Round 14 race on Sunday despite starting from pole position.Rowland eventually bounced back to finally seal his championship win by finishing fourth in the race. He missed out on the podium, which had Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy as the winner, but his 12 points, along with his closest competitor Pascal Wehrlein’s disappointing performance, were enough for him to clinch the championship.“I wasn't aware of where Pascal was at all. My engineer came on, I think with four or five laps to go, and said ‘P4 is good,’ and I thought that's a bit weird. Then I looked at the TV screen, and I got to about eighth, and I thought, ‘Oh, he's not in the top eight then.’ The next time I came around looking again, I found him when I started from the bottom. I didn't know if he'd had a problem, so then I was aware that fourth would be enough if Wehrlein didn't score, so I knew that myself. I didn't want to ask, because I didn't want to jinx anything,” he said.Oliver Rowland took to Instagram on Wednesday to share a post to mark his Formula E Championship win. Sharing a few pictures of his celebrations with his team, the Nissan driver wrote: “2025 FIA FORMULA E WORLD CHAMPION! It still hasn’t quite sunk in what we have achieved this season. I couldn’t have imagined being in this position 2 years ago! Thank you to my incredible team @nismo & everyone that’s supported me!

The race was won by Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy, while DS Penske’s Jean-Eric Vergne finished third.Sharing a picture of the champagne celebrations on the podium at the Tempelhof Airport Circuit, Dennis wrote on Instagram: “P2!!

World champion looks good on you!”Speaking after the race, Dennis reflected on his recent struggles, having finished 17th in consecutive races leading up to Berlin.“We had a really good race car and the strategy we took into the race was perfectly executed. I had every opportunity to win this race, and we got pretty close. I’m not too surprised to be up here — I’m just super happy for myself and for the team. We’ve been on a real bad luck streak recently, so to reward them with a P2 is the least I could do,” he said.Looking ahead to his home race in London, which also serves as the Season 11 Formula E finale, Dennis said, “I’m excited to have this little boost going into the final stretch, my home race in London. It’s needed. It’s more for morale. Oliver [Rowland] has already won the championship, so massive congratulations to him. I’m super happy for him, he’s a good friend of mine.”Also Read: Nick Cassidy on Berlin E-Prix win: “I don’t want to take the moment from Oliver Rowland” Jake Dennis currently sits tenth in the 2025 Formula E Drivers' Standings with 77 points.

Pascal Wehrlein clinches podium in Berlin Round 13

Pascal Wehrlein fights to secure his position in Formula E Driver Standings

It was a special day for German driver Pascal Wehrlein at his home race, the Berlin E-Prix, on Saturday. Despite facing a three-place grid penalty, the TAG Heuer Porsche driver delivered a stellar performance to reach the podium. Wehrlein, driving car No. 94, finished second in Round 13 at the Tempelhof Airport Circuit and celebrated the moment with his daughter on stage.Pascal Wehrlein secured his fifth podium of the season at the Berlin E-Prix on Saturday, overcoming a grid penalty received for colliding with teammate Antonio Felix Da Costa during FP1 on Friday. He also earned extra points for setting the fastest lap in the race.After the event, Wehrlein shared several photos on Instagram, including a heartwarming one of him holding his daughter. He captioned it: “I promised you a trophy. P2 at our first home race of the season. Grateful to have family and friends here to share the moment. Let’s go again tomorrow.”The achievement was even sweeter as it helped Wehrlein close the gap with championship leader Oliver Rowland to just 50 points. Rowland failed to finish Saturday’s race and retired early. However, on Sunday, fortunes reversed — Wehrlein couldn’t convert his pole position into a podium, while Rowland finished fourth, securing enough points to clinch this year’s Formula E World Championship.Sharing his thoughts after the Round 13 race, Wehrlein said, “It was an important day and a good race, starting from P9. Finishing second is a good result, but we had a small taste of the victory. I think pace-wise, we were the quickest, so I tried really hard and it was close in the end. I think we can be happy with today, good points for the team, good points for the championship. Every race is all-in and we try to maximise every one. ”His second-place finish also gave a crucial boost to TAG Heuer Porsche in the Teams’ and Manufacturers’ Championship.Following Sunday’s race, where Pascal Wehrlein failed to score and Oliver Rowland picked up 12 points, Wehrlein remains second in the Formula E Drivers’ Standings with 125 points.

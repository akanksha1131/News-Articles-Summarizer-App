Virat Kohli and his love for Adelaide

Nitish Kumar Reddy's Test debut was a memorable one. He contributed significantly to the team's 295-run victory over Australia in Perth. His scores of 41 and 38 not out, along with a wicket, were instrumental in the youngsters' success.Reddy received his debut cap from his idol, Virat Kohli . He was at the crease when Kohli scored an unbeaten century in the second innings. Reddy recounted the journey from taking a selfie with Kohli and Anushka Sharma at the 2018 BCCI awards to sharing the playing eleven with him.""This was a safety photo, at the time he (Virat Kohli) was so famous. I felt that if I don't get a photo chance, let's take a picture now. It's reminding me of my childhood memories. From childhood, I was a huge fan of Virat bhaiya. I used to watch every match of his, so that he scores a hundred and celebrates it. I liked his celebration a lot ‚Äì at that time, I used to calculate my age so as to see if he doesn't retire when I make my debut for India.""Reddy described watching Kohli approach his century. He was so focused on Kohli's achievement that he almost forgot he was nearing a half-century himself.""Now playing with him and I was seeing him close to ten runs, then five runs and I was thinking, he's close to getting his hundred. Even, I didn't realise that I was close to getting my fifty ‚Äì it would be my first fifty in Tests if I scored 12 runs. I was so pumped up when he got his 81st hundred and it was a great moment to see,"" said Reddy in a video posted on bcci.tv.Having made his T20I debut in October, Reddy reflected on his cricketing journey. He recalled his father's sacrifice in leaving his government job to support his career in Visakhapatnam.""To be honest, I was not that serious when I was young. My father left his job for me. There has been lots of sacrifice in my story.""Reddy described a turning point in his career. Witnessing his father's emotional distress due to financial difficulties spurred him to take his cricket more seriously.""One day I saw him crying due to financial problems he had, and it felt like I had to do the hard work. Like, your father did this sacrifice and you are just enjoying cricket by playing it for fun. So that time, I took it seriously and suddenly in one year, I got the growth, did the hard work and it paid off.""Reddy expressed pride in his father's happiness and acknowledged the recognition his father received for his son's achievements. He presented his first jersey to his father as a token of gratitude.""Everyone said, 'Mutyala Reddy, you made your son go this far'. As a son of a middle class family, I am so proud that my father is so happy now and I gave my first jersey to him, where I saw happiness in his face and felt immensely proud.""Reddy also shared how KL Rahul's advice helped him during his debut in Perth. He felt comfortable approaching Rahul for guidance.""I was a bit nervous at first on how I will interact with players, who I have seen on TV while growing up. So, if I have any problems, I just want to go & talk with KL bhai. I somehow feel good vibes from him, whatever suggestions he gives that works for me.""Rahul's advice to slow down the game proved beneficial for Reddy, who felt things were moving too quickly in his first match.""He once said, 'Macha, when you go out in the centre, everything is going so fast. Don't go so fast, just slow down the game'. It's because my first match went in that way; everything happened so fast in seconds and that really helped me before going out to bat in my debut match.""Reddy highlighted the importance of shadow practice in his preparation. He visualized facing different bowlers and planning his shots based on the situation.""I do like doing a lot of shadow practising. At that time, I visualise bowlers who are going to bowl to me and what all shots I can play to them as per the situation. When you actually face them in the centre, it will be like 'Arey, you already practiced against them in shadow practice'. So, that's how I keep my routine simple.""Looking ahead to the second game in Adelaide, Reddy expressed his excitement about playing with the pink ball. He had a glimpse of this during the tour match against Prime Minister's XI, where he scored 42.""I am so excited, I had a good debut and I just want to continue my contribution to the team. With the pink ball, I want to see how much swing I can get as a fast-bowler. When I faced the first ball (in the practice match), I left it and saw how it behaved.""Reddy aims to maintain his hunger for good performances. He believes in his all-round abilities and wants to contribute to the team in any way possible.""I just want to maintain my hunger for good performances. I personally feel I do good in three dimensions, and want to help the team whatever they want from me, so that's what I want to just focus on.""","Nitish Kumar Reddy made his Test debut against Australia in Perth.

Kohli's love affair with Adelaide

Historic win

NEW DELHI: With an astounding victory in the first Test against Australia in Perth, the Indian cricket team is on a high. But now that's in the past and the second Test is set to get underway at the Adelaide Oval from December 6.The day/night Test could well be the toughest game for India on the tour as Australia are yet to taste defeat with the pink ball here and the visitors don't have fond memories from their last fixture in 2020. India were bundled out for just 36 in their second innings and registered their lowest total in the format.Overall, India have played 13 Tests at the Adelaide Oval and have won only 2, lost 8 and managed to draw 3 matches.India played their first Test at Adelaide in January 1948 under the captaincy of Lala Amarnath and despite centuries by Vijay Hazare in both the innings, they lost the match by an innings and 16 runs.India's second Test at Adelaide in December 1967 saw them losing the match by 146 runs. The third Test at Adelaide in January 1978 saw India fighting hard but the Aussies ended up victorious by 47 runs.After three consecutive defeats at Adelaide, the visitors finally managed to draw a Test at the venue in January 1981 under the captaincy of the great Sunil Gavaskar. The result was possible due to Sandeep Patel who smashed 174 despite batting in the Test after sustaining injuries to his head, inflicted by bouncers from Australia's fast bowlers during the first Test at Sydney.Four years later, the legendary Kapil Dev led from the front as captain by taking 8 wickets in Australia's first innings and Gavaskar hit a brilliant 166 in the first innings total of 520 as India drew the December 1985 fixture at the venue.More disappointment was in store in 1992 as chasing 372, captain Mohammad Azharuddin hit 106 but India were bowled out for 333 runs to lose their next Test by 38 runs.During India's 1999 tour to Australia under the captaincy of Sachin Tendulkar , the first Test was played at Adelaide. Chasing 396, India lost the Test by 285 runs.India, however, made history in their next Test at Adelaide in December 2003 and took a 1-0 series lead against Australia in Australia for the first time ever.The Aussies racked up 556 and India were 85/4 but Rahul Dravid (233) and VVS Laxman (148) put up a 303-run stand for the fifth wicket. Ajit Agarkar then took 6/41 and Dravid hit an unbeaten 72 as India won the match by 4 wickets.India's next tour to Australia came in 2007-08 when all hell broke loose due to the Monkeygate scandal. By the time the teams reached Adelaide for the fourth and last Test of the series in January 2008, the Aussies already had an unassailable lead in the series.Sachin Tendulkar hit 153 in the first innings and it was Virender Sehwag 's 151 in the second essay which ensured a draw.For the next tour of Australia in 2011-12, some seniors left for Australia early to acclimatise to the conditions but even that couldn't prevent India losing the series 0-4.In the fourth Test of the series in Adelaide in January 2012, a young Virat Kohli roared to his maiden Test century. Although India lost the match by 298 runs, Kohli's hundred established him as a key player in India's Test line-up and marked the beginning of a prolific Test career.Kohli continued his love affair with Adelaide when India next toured Australia, hitting twin hundreds on captaincy debut in December 2014. India came close to an improbable victory but fell short, losing by 48 runs.India's victory in Adelaide in December 2018 during the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy was a historic moment in Indian cricket as it set the tone for India's maiden Test series win on Australian soil.Cheteshwar Pujara scored 123 but India were bowled out for 250. The bowlers did well to earn a crucial 15-run lead and the visitors set a challenging target of 323 for Australia. Jasprit Bumrah (3/68), Mohammed Shami (3/65), and Ashwin (3/92) starred with the ball as Australia were bowled out for 291 for a 31-run victory.This was India's first Test win in Adelaide since 2003 and marked the beginning of India's historic 2-1 series victory, the first-ever Test series win by an Asian team in Australia.India's next tour of Australia began on a disastrous note as the infamous 36 all out in Adelaide occurred during the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in December 2020.Captain Virat Kohli left the series after the Adelaide Test for the birth of his child, handing the reins to Ajinkya Rahane.From thereon, India made an incredible comeback by winning the Melbourne Test under Rahane's leadership, drew the Sydney Test in heroic fashion and clinched the series 2-1 with a historic victory at the Gabba in Brisbane.The 36 all out remains a stark reminder of cricket's unpredictability and resilience as India transformed their fortunes dramatically in the same series. It now remains to be seen what Adelaide has in store for India.","India have played 13 Tests at the Adelaide Oval and have won only 2, lost 8 and managed to draw 3 matches.

Why Rohit Sharma's decision to play KL Rahul as opener makes sense,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/why-rohit-sharmas-decision-to-play-kl-rahul-as-opener-makes-sense/articleshow/116004524.cms,"KL Rahul and Rohit Sharma (Julian Finney/Getty Images)

India vs Australia: Unleash Rohit Sharma in middle order

""He ( KL Rahul ) will open the innings. I will play somewhere in the middle... "" Rohit Sharma ended the suspense when he confirmed India's openers for the Adelaide Test vs Australia from December 6. Rahul did a phenomenal job with the bat in both innings of the Perth Test and continued with his good touch during the practice fixture PM XI in Canberra.Even after Rahul's returns with the bat, there was no clarity whether he would continue in the opening position especially after Rohit rejoined the squad after missing the series opener due to the birth of his second child.The Indian captain, however, chose to stick with the successful combination at top of the order and feels Rahul deserves that spot.""We want result, we want success. Those two guys at the top they batted brilliantly in Perth. I was watching from home. Rahul was brilliant to watch. He deserves that place at this point in time,"" says Rohit.The skipper further adds that the move to bat down the order will not be an easy one for him but it's in the larger interest of the team.""There is no need to change that now, may be things will be different in future. Personally not easy for me (to move down) but for the team it made a lot of sense,"" explains Rohit while adding that he will bat somewhere in the middle.Rahul, who has faced significant criticism recently for underperforming, got an opportunity to open the innings for India in the first Test against Australia, and he did not disappoint the fans as he scored crucial 26 in first innings and gave India a solid start in the second innings to score 77 runs.The right-handed batter, often considered one of the most technically sound players playing for India, has not had a consistent run with the bat in the longest format. He has been moved up and down the order, across formats, and the lack of consistency in the batting position could well be the reason behind his inconsistent returns.Despite having played 233 innings for India across all formats, KL Rahul still lacks a fixed batting position. The 32-year-old has already amassed over 8,200 runs, including 17 centuries for India. Among these, he has scored more than 3,000 runs in Tests, including 8 centuries.Rahul has already scored centuries in SENA countries, demonstrating his ability to perform on tracks with extra bounce and pronounced swing while also excelling against spin in subcontinental conditions. Rahul‚Äôs flexibility to bat anywhere often works for the team, but it also leaves him vulnerable to criticism.Rohit Sharma's Test career took off after he was given a permanent opening slot, allowing him to operate with the mindset of an opener for a long period. KL Rahul too hasn't had a bad run at top of the order. In 77 innings as an opener, he has scored 2654 runs with seven centuries and 13 half-centuries, averaging 40, and a highest score of 199.However, when moved down the order, Rahul's performance drops. In the 16 innings he has played in other positions, he has managed just 430 runs, including one century. As the team looks to groom younger players, the 32-year-old Rahul still awaits stability in his batting position.While Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal have established themselves as India‚Äôs premier opening pair in Tests, Rahul‚Äôs performances as an opener have been noteworthy. During India‚Äôs England tour 2021-22, Rahul emerged as India‚Äôs third highest run-scorer of the series, behind Rohit and Rishabh Pant With form on his side and Rohit's recent struggles vs pace as he was dismissed by New Zealand pacers four times in six innings during a Test series, Rahul is set to get an extended run at top of the order. It makes sense for now, a lot of sense. But it remains to be seen whether Rahul will find the consistency which everyone expects from him.","KL Rahul and Rohit Sharma confirmed as openers for Adelaide Test.

India vs Australia: KL Rahul keeps his batting position for Adelaide Test vs Australia a SECRET!

NEW DELHI: The much-anticipated second Test between India and Australia at the Adelaide Oval is set to be an intriguing encounter, featuring the unique challenge of a day-night pink-ball contest. With India leading the series 1-0 after a commanding victory in Perth, this match carries high stakes for both teams.While India welcomes back skipper Rohit Sharma, who confirmed he will bat in the middle order to allow KL Rahul to continue opening, Australia will look to capitalize on their impressive record in pink-ball Tests at home.Weather conditions could play a significant role, particularly on the opening day, where forecasts indicate a 40% chance of rain and potential thunderstorms on Friday.As per AccuWeather.com, the forecast on Friday is particularly bad in the afternoon -- 'cloudy with 47% chance of rain at 12 pm, and thunderstorms with 51% chance of rain at 1 pm.'But it gets better at the time of toss, 2 pm local time, with the forecast of 'cloudy with 15% chance of rain.' The forecast gets better after that, with rain forecast decreasing every hour.The weekend and the following days appear more favorable for uninterrupted play, though some light showers could appear on the fifth day, should the match stretch that far.The Adelaide Oval pitch promises a balanced contest. Traditionally known for its coarse, mat-like grass and low clay content, it offers assistance to fast bowlers early in the match, especially during the twilight and night sessions when the pink ball tends to swing and seam more. As the game progresses, the pitch usually flattens, allowing batters to score more freely if they can settle in. Spin is also expected to play a role, particularly in the later stages, with the dry surface aiding turn and grip.India will rely on their bowlers to exploit the conditions under lights, while their batters, bolstered by the form of Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul, aim to build solid partnerships. Australia, with their formidable pace attack led by Mitchell Starc and the ever-reliable Nathan Lyon in the spin department, will seek to make the most of the conditions.The last time India played at this venue, they endured their infamous 36 all-out collapse. However, this team has grown significantly since then, boasting a strong record in day-night Tests. For Australia, the Adelaide Oval remains a fortress in pink-ball cricket, adding to the intrigue of this high-stakes clash. Weather permitting, fans can expect an enthralling contest between two evenly matched teams.","The much-anticipated second Test between India and Australia at the Adelaide Oval is set to be an intriguing encounter.

How a change in batting position could well help Rohit Sharma in Tests

Rohit Sharma: 'KL Rahul to open, I will bat somewhere in the middle'

NEW DELHI: Back to lead India in the day/night Test against Australia at the Adelaide Oval , Rohit Sharma was a picture of confidence and looked relaxed during his press conference on Thursday.India lead 1-0 in the five-Test series after a thumping 295-run victory in Perth under the captaincy of Jasprit Bumrah , the Test that Rohit missed due to the birth of his son.Going into the second Test, the biggest question India faced was the batting position of KL Rahul after he put up a brilliant 201-run opening stand with Yashasvi Jaiswal in the second innings of the Perth Test.When asked about his batting position in the second Test, Rohit confirmed Rahul's batting spot.""KL will open the innings and I will play somewhere in the middle. Not easy for me but it's the best for the team,"" Rohit told reporters on the eve of the second Test.Rohit's Test career took a turn for the better after he began opening in 2019.""What KL has shown outside India, he deserves that place (opening slot),"" Rohit added.Rohit said he decided to change his batting position keeping the team's interests in mind.""We want result, we want success. Those two guys at the top they batted brilliantly in Perth. I was watching from home. Rahul was brilliant to watch. He deserves that place at this point in time.""There is no need to change that now, may be things will be different in future. Personally not easy for me (to move down) but for the team it made a lot of sense,"" said Rohit adding that he will bat somewhere in the middle.In India's remarkable Perth win, Rahul - opening for the first time since February 2023 - chewed up 74 balls as India collapsed for 150 in 298 balls in their first innings. He then stayed put for 176 balls in a 201-run opening stand as Jaiswal scored 161.Even though Rohit was elated following their triumph in Perth, he acknowledged that it would be difficult to play with a pink ball under lights at Adelaide Oval.Australia had bundled out India 36 in their second innings to inflict an eight-wicket defeat in 2020 and they have won all seven of their day-night Test matches at the venue.""You are so used to playing with a red ball and the pink ball certainly does a little bit more than the red ball,"" Rohit said.""At the same time we have been training here for the past three days and I certainly felt that the more time you spend playing the pink ball, it gets a little easier.""The pink ball will have its challenges under lights, during the day as well -- you just have to find your own way of dealing with it.""",Rohit Sharma confirms KL Rahul will open for India in second Test against Australia.

Loud taunts, players heckled during Team India nets in Adelaide

New Zealand's captain, Tom Latham , agrees with England skipper Ben Stokes , regarding concerns about current over-rate rules in Test cricket . They believe a review is needed, especially for matches dominated by seam bowling. This follows penalties imposed on both teams for slow over-rates during the first Test match in Christchurch, which England won.Current International Cricket Council (ICC) rules mandate 15 overs per hour. Both teams received fines and lost World Test Championship (WTC) points despite the match ending two days early.""The frustration stems back to the Ashes,"" Stokes said in Wellington ahead of the second Test.Stokes has been openly protesting by refusing to sign over-rate sheets. He voiced his frustrations in Wellington before the second Test.""It‚Äôs been over a year since I raised this issue, and we‚Äôve heard nothing back from the ICC. There‚Äôs never an over-rate issue in Asia because of the heavy use of spin. There needs to be consideration for seam-dominant matches,"" Stokes said.England's over-rate penalties have already eliminated them from next year's WTC final contention. New Zealand's slim hopes of qualifying were also hampered by the three-point deduction from theChristchurch Test .Latham admitted the difficulty of maintaining the required rate when seam bowling is prevalent. He pointed out that this isn't a problem in subcontinental conditions where spin bowling is more common.""It‚Äôs certainly a challenge to get through 15 overs an hour, especially when the ball‚Äôs flying to the boundary,"" he said.He suggested a review of the regulations, emphasizing that no team wants to be penalized for slow over-rates.""In subcontinental conditions, where spin dominates, this isn‚Äôt an issue. Perhaps it‚Äôs time to review the regulations, as no team wants to fall behind on over-rates,"" Latham added.The second Test at the Basin Reserve presents a similar challenge. Both teams have primarily seam bowlers, with only one specialist spinner between them. This increases the likelihood of further over-rate issues.","New Zealand captain Tom Latham agrees with England skipper Ben Stokes.

NEW DELHI: A tragic stampede at a football stadium in southern Guinea resulted in 56 fatalities and numerous injuries following fan clashes, as announced by the Guinean government on Monday.The government has initiated an investigation to identify those responsible for the Sunday incident, according to Communications Minister Fana Soumah 's televised statement.Local media and political groups reported that children were among those who lost their lives, reported news agency AP.The incident occurred on Sunday afternoon at Nzerekore stadium during a local tournament final between Labe and Nzerekore teams, organised to honour military leader Mamadi Doumbouya , as stated by Prime Minister Amadou Oury Bah on X.Bah confirmed casualties without providing specifics, noting that regional authorities were working to stabilise the situation.According to local reports, security forces deployed tear gas to control the chaos that erupted after a contested penalty decision.Media Guinea reported that the disputed penalty sparked supporter outrage, leading to stone-throwing and subsequent tear gas deployment by security forces. The outlet noted that children were among the deceased, with several critically injured victims receiving treatment at a regional hospital.Video footage from the venue showed supporters protesting referee decisions before conflicts erupted, with spectators spilling onto the pitch.The recordings captured people fleeing the stadium, with many scaling the high perimeter fence.Additional footage showed numerous casualties on a hospital floor surrounded by people providing assistance to the wounded.The National Alliance for Alternation and Democracy opposition group demanded an inquiry, criticising the tournament as a vehicle for promoting the military leader's ""illegal and inappropriate"" political aspirations.Guinea has been under military governance since the 2021 coup that removed President Alpha Conde. It joins other West African nations, including Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, where military takeovers have delayed civilian rule restoration.Doumbouya, who led the coup three years ago, claimed to prevent national chaos and criticised the previous administration's unfulfilled promises, though he faces criticism for not meeting public expectations.","A tragic stampede at a football stadium in southern Guinea resulted in 56 fatalities and numerous injuries.

Clashes erupted at a football match in N'Zerekore , Guinea , on Sunday, leaving many dead.According to hospital sources quoted by AFP, ""There are bodies lined up as far as the eye can see in the hospital. Others are lying on the floor in the hallways. The morgue is full.""""There are around 100 dead"", said one doctor, while another said there were ""dozens of dead"".According to witnesses, the anger was fueled by a referee's decision that was contested, after which the fans invaded the pitch and later also set the N'Zerekore police station on fire.Media reports indicated that the game was organised as part of a tournament dedicated to Guinea's current president and junta chief, Mamadi Doumbouya , who took control through a coup in 2021.In Guinea, these tournaments have become increasingly prevalent as Doumbouya appears to be positioning himself for the anticipated presidential elections next year, whilst political alignments continue to develop.In September 2021, Doumbouya, then serving as a colonel, led a successful coup against President Alpha Conde. Ironically, Conde had previously appointed Doumbouya to lead an elite unit responsible for protecting the president from such takeovers.Despite international demands and his initial commitment to transfer authority to civilian leadership by December 2024, Doumbouya has since reversed his stance and indicated he will retain power.","Clashes erupted at a football match in N'Zerekore, Guinea, on Sunday, leaving many dead.

I kept on fighting,"" said Berrettini.Kokkinakis clung on to take the first set to a tie-break which he shaded.Berrettini claimed the second with a break in the eighth game, which he served out.Kokkinakis survived two break points in the first game of the third set and no others emerged in an even battle until the 11th game when he conceded two more.Berrettini capitalised on the first and clinched the set with an ace to delight thousands of Italian supporters at the Martin Carpena arena.""I felt I was playing an away tie, it was tough on Australia -- we were playing in Spain but I thought we were in Italy,"" said Kokkinakis, echoing prior Australian complaints about the revamped Davis Cup format.""Once again we're a long way from Australia aren't we?"" said captain Lleyton Hewitt.""It will be nice when they take our bid seriously to host the finals, Australia will put on a bloody good event.""",Italy beat Australia 2-0 in Davis Cup final in Malaga.

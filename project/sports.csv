Alcaraz vs Sinner or Federer vs Nadal?





: Coming into the French Open final, the one question that had not been answered in the bubbling rivalry between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner was how would they hold up with a major title on the line. They had showcased their class progressionally in the Round of 16, the quarters and the semi-finals.On Sunday, they took that up multifold with a five-hour 29-minute classic that became the longest Roland Garros final in the Open Era. A running forehand down the line winner later, it was Alcaraz who kept his flawless record in major finals alive.The Spaniard came from two sets down to win 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 to stage a comeback for the history books. In what transpired as the second-longest Grand Slam final since 1968, when the Open Era began, Alcaraz saved three championship points while serving at 3-5 (0-40) in the fourth set.In the decider, Alcaraz led 5-3, got broken, and needed a super tie-break to become only the third man this century - after Gustavo Kuerten and Rafael Nadal - to defend the French Open title. He also became just the third man in the Open Era - after Gaston Gaudio and Novak Djokovic - to save a championship point enroute to a Grand Slam title.The match of extremely small, razor thin margins had Sinner win 193 of the 385 total points while Alcaraz, who won his fifth Grand Slam title, had one less.""This was the most exciting match that I've played so far without a doubt,"" said Alcaraz. ""I think the match had everything.""""Today was all about believing in myself. Never doubted myself today and I tried to go for it,"" he said. ""Real champions are made in those situations,"" he added.After two hours and 12 minutes, Sinner led the match by two sets and the points breakdown by nine (82-73).As the match progressed, ticking past the four-hour mark, another powerful stat emerged. Sinner had never won a match that went past four hours (0-5). At the other end, Alcaraz had never won after losing the first two sets (0-8). One of the two were primed to end that drought with blows from the back getting fiercer and touches at the net getting silkier.You could not put this past Alcaraz who has had bad starts in major finals before only to win the tournament anyway. He trailed Novak Djokovic in the 2023 Wimbledon final and Alexander Zverev here last year.And that streak continued in Paris on Sunday as the 22-year-old banked on the crowd and his typical never-say-die attitude to reel off four straight games in the third set to relegate Sinner to his first set dropped in the tournament.Then, again, standing a point away from defeat, Alcaraz polished off five straight points to hold serve at 3-5 in the fourth set. He then broke Sinner's serve with the Italian attempting to clinch his third straight major title.The crowd vehemently supported Alcaraz as he bagged the tiebreak in the fourth set and forced a decisive fifth set. The Spaniard's racket, masquerading as a magic wand, started to produce astounding drop shots from deep with cross-court forehands landing in with plenty of zip and accuracy.In a match of unending twists, it was Sinner's turn to add some drama to the mix with Alcaraz broken at 5-4 when serving for the title. The World No. 1 picked three games in a row to overturn a 3-5 deficit into a 6-5 lead.In the 10-point tiebreak that followed, Alcaraz showed the three C's that have been passed on from his grandfather - cabeza (head), corazon (heart) and cojones (balls). He didn't shy away from referring to all three in the aftermath.""To put it to words was just happened is really difficult honestly. Two sets down against the World No. 1, with the level that he was playing. I just put my heart into it and tried to keep it going. Never gave up. I was just fighting. Point after point. In the end it was all heart,"" he said on Eurosport.""I played with my grandfather's three Cs. My grandfather is proud. After the match I played, I think I can say that (cojones),"" he added.Two weeks ago, it was Nadal who was feted on Court Philippe-Chatrier. For his 14 titles here and a jaw-dropping 112-4 win-loss record. Alcaraz was one of the thousands in attendance then, beaming, all smiles as his idol was celebrated.In a full circle moment, a fortnight later it was another Spaniard who was celebrated and feted for a trophy run. It was Alcaraz who stood atop the podium with the Coupe des Mousquetaires in tow.His trophy count in Paris may only read two, dwarfed by Nadal's superhuman tally, but the signs of a legend are there. At 22 years, 1 month and 3 days, Alcaraz has won his fifth Grand Slam title - the EXACT same age as Nadal when he achieved the same feat.There have been only 12 matches in this Alcaraz vs Sinner rivalry with the Spaniard leading by 8-4 having polished off the last five matches. The duel between them is eerily similar to that of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal's historic tussles.Federer, who had a positive head-to-head record against much of the tour during his prime, only struggled to fend off Nadal with their rivalry finishing off at 24-16 in favour of the Spaniard.Sinner can relate with that stat. Since 2024, his win-loss record stands at 91-8. Remove Alcaraz out of that equation and it gets refreshed to 91-3. The last time the 23-year-old had a win over Alcaraz was back in September 2023.Even if the rivalry looks skewed on paper, on court, where it all matters, the margins, like on Sunday, is just a point. And we're here for it - and Carlos agrees.""This is the first match in a Grand Slam final. Hopefully not the last time,"" said Alcaraz.""Because I mean, as I said many times, every time that we face against each other, we raise our level to the top.""","Carlos Alcaraz has successfully defended his French Open crown with the win over Jannik Sinner in the final. The Spaniard came from two sets down to win 4-6 6-7, 6-4, 7-6,7-6 to stage a comeback for the history books. He also became just the third man in the Open Era - after Gaston Gaudio and Novak Djokovic - to save a championship point enroute to a Grand Slam title.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121716126,imgsize-155532,width-400,resizemode-4/121716126.jpg"

Football legend and Portugal icon Cristiano Ronaldo added a third international trophy to his cabinet as he led his side to the summit of the UEFA Nations League on Sunday at the Allianz Arena in Munich. Coming up against a Spain team that hadn't lost a single away game in their last 10 outings in the competition, the inaugural Nations League winners showed incredible resilience to force the game to extra-time and ultimately seal the win on penalties.As Portugal claimed victory from spot kicks, Ronaldo took center stage for his emotional reaction. The 40-year-old, overcome with passion, let the tears flow as he dropped to his knees the moment Ruben Neves' kick went in.Akin to his reaction in the 2016 UEFA Euro final against France, Ronaldo broke down in tears as he added another trophy to his long list of honours. The win meant that Portugal became the first team in the history of the Nations League to win the competition twice.Ronaldo's involvement in the game was not limited to that, as he scored the all-important equalizer to pull his team back into the game, halfway through the second half.Ronaldo's goal came in the 61st minute, when a deflected cross from goal scorer Nuno Mendes fell invitingly in front of the forward who had placed himself at the far post. Beating his marker with ease, the No 7's volley found its way into the back of the net.Ronaldo was then taken off in the 88th minute owing to an injury and was replaced by PSG forward Goncalo Ramos. Ronaldo's teary-eyed reaction to winning the final has gone viral on social media, with fans pouring in messages of support and congratulations for the five-time Ballon d'Or winner.Up next, the Portuguese talisman will look to earn his side qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.",Portugal beat Spain 1-0 on penalties to win the UEFA Nations League.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 6: Harish Thawani on cricket's TV market and the watershed moments





Cricket’s unpredictable nature was on full display during a Big Cricket League (BCL) match in Surat, Gujarat, as a rare and bizarre moment involving batter Chirag Gandhi went viral on social media. The incident, which occurred on December 15 last year during a match between UP Brij Stars and MP Tigers, left players, umpires and fans in disbelief - and laughter.The dramatic moment came when Gandhi, batting on 98, dragged a delivery from spinner Pawan Negi onto his stumps. The off-stump visibly shifted and leaned toward the middle stump, prompting the fielding side to erupt in celebration. But what happened next stunned everyone: the bail remained perfectly balanced on the stump, defying the laws of physics - and cricket.Even the on-field umpires were caught chuckling at the surreal scene as Gandhi calmly pointed to the bail still in place. The moment has since gone viral, with one fan aptly captioning it, “I’ve never seen better luck than this in cricket.”Despite this stroke of fortune, Gandhi’s team could not chase down MP Tigers’ mammoth 239-run total.UP Brij Stars finished at 168/5 in their 20 overs, with Gandhi staying unbeaten on 101 off 58 balls - a valiant knock that featured 12 fours and four sixes. His partnership of 112 runs with Aryan Kumar (42) was the only bright spot in an otherwise one-sided contest.The Yusuf Pathan-led MP Tigers dominated the game, thanks to Saket Sharma’s 101 off 52 balls and a blazing unbeaten 87 from Pawan Negi, the bowler who was denied Gandhi’s wicket in comical fashion.As the video continues to spread across cricket circles, it stands as yet another reminder: in cricket, the game truly isn’t over until the last bail falls.","Chirag Gandhi was dismissed by Pawan Negi during a Big Cricket League match in Surat, Gujarat.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 6: Harish Thawani on cricket's TV market and the watershed moments





NEW DELHI: Batting legend Sunil Gavaskar has voiced strong criticism of the Indian Premier League ’s (IPL) growing tendency to prioritise raw, untested talent over consistent domestic performers.In his column for Mid-Day, Gavaskar argued that franchises must shift their scouting focus from state-level T20 leagues and U-19 tournaments to more competitive platforms like the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.“This year’s IPL proved once again that relying on the performances of the state T20 leagues is not the way to go into the auction,” Gavaskar wrote. “It’s far better to go by the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy deeds as these games are a lot more competitive.”The former India captain also highlighted a worrying trend among younger players, suggesting that early fame and financial rewards might be affecting their motivation. “Many of the youngsters not used to so much money lose the motivation and are quite content just to be around rather than perform,” he said.Gavaskar emphasised the importance of temperament and match awareness over flashy, short-term impact. “What is needed is to see when the batting and bowling performances came,” he noted. “The runs and the wickets have to come when it matters.”He also questioned the obsession with strike rates, saying: “Some will justify scoring 15 in five deliveries as it’s a strike rate of 300, but maybe it was important that they batted another 15 deliveries and got 40 to take the team to a win.”Slamming many so-called “six hitters” who dazzled in smaller leagues but flopped on the big stage, Gavaskar concluded that “temperament and timing” must be valued as much as power and potential.","Sunil Gavaskar criticises Indian Premier League's tendency to prioritise raw, untested talent over consistent domestic performers.

Former South African cricketer Heinrich Klaasen announced his retirement from international cricket at age 33, citing coaching changes and inability to reach an agreement with Cricket South Africa regarding his participation in major T20 leagues alongside international commitments. Klaasen had initially planned to continue playing white-ball cricket until the 2027 Cricket World Cup in South Africa.The departure of Rob Walter as coach and appointment of Shukri Conrad to lead the white-ball side led to uncertainty in Klaasen's career plans. Despite being South Africa's top ODI run-scorer since 2023, he was left out of the central contract list in April.Klaasen has been a dominant force in T20 cricket since 2022, amassing 3,833 runs in 145 appearances for South Africa and various franchises. He maintained an impressive average of 35.49 and a strike rate of 158.19, including three centuries and 25 fifties.In ODIs since 2023, Klaasen scored 1,345 runs in 30 matches at an average of 51.73 and a strike rate of 135.58, with three centuries and seven fifties. He had previously retired from Test cricket after playing four matches between 2019 and 2023.""I felt for a long time that I did not really care about any of my performances and whether the team won or not.That is the wrong place to be,"" Klaasen told Rapport.""I had a long conversation with Rob before the Champions Trophy, and I told him I did not feel good in my heart about what was going on. I was not enjoying it that much. We talked nicely, we planned everything nicely up to and including the World Cup in 2027. So when he finished as coach and the [contract] negotiations [with CSA] did not go as planned, it made my decision a lot easier,"" he added.The negotiations with Cricket South Africa failed as Klaasen's participation in Major League Cricket and The Hundred would have prevented him from playing in the Zimbabwe-New Zealand tri-nation series and the white-ball tour to Australia.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Family considerations also played a role in his decision. ""Now I can spend six or seven months at home. My family needs it. It has been a long four years with a lot of travel. I need a little rest,"" said Klaasen, who has a two-and-a-half-year-old daughter.Throughout his career, Klaasen was known for his signature whip-pull shot against spinners.

He had previously retired from Test cricket after playing four matches between 2019 and 2023.

South African batsman Aiden Markram expressed confidence that his team will overcome past tournament failures when they face Australia in the World Test Championship final at Lord's on Wednesday. Speaking to reporters at Lord's on Sunday, Markram addressed concerns about previous defeats, including last year's T20 World Cup final loss to India in Barbados.South Africa's previous heartbreak in the T20 World Cup final saw them fall short despite needing just 30 runs from 30 balls with six wickets in hand against India.Markram, who captained the T20 team and is one of five players from that match in the current WTC final squad, believes the Test team under Temba Bavuma 's leadership will approach this challenge differently.""This team is a bit different. The few of us that have been a part of previous events that didn't go our way have dealt with it, have obviously chatted to each other and made sure we've buried it nicely and taken some good lessons from it. But besides from that now, it's more about the excitement of having another opportunity to actually do the job. So that's pretty much where the mind is at the moment.""As an opener, Markram will face Australia's formidable bowling attack, while South Africa counters with their own impressive pace attack led by Kagiso Rabada ""When you're opening the batting, obviously your responsibility is to get the team off to a good start and get us ahead of the game. So that's the challenge, that's what excites us. But when you're preparing against your bowlers, who are world-class, it can only help you as a batter, as uncomfortable as it can be at times.""South Africa's qualification for the final came after winning seven consecutive Tests, mostly in short series formats.""A lot of our series have been two-game series. So in order to win that series, you can't start slow. There's no second dip at it, so we're going to have to make sure we hit the ground running and are nice and sharp come day one.""The 30-year-old Markram, with 45 Test matches under his belt, anticipates the historic opportunity to play at Lord's.""To play in a Test match here is really special and then obviously for it to be a final is probably the cherry on top.""When asked about what makes Lord's memorable, Markram responded: ""Probably just the history...You know how many of the greats of the game have played here. For us to have that opportunity to play on the same field and share that changing room that they once sat in is quite a cool thought.""",South Africa face Australia in the World Test Championship final at Lord's.

South African spinner Keshav Maharaj and Australian spinner Nathan Lyon exchanged mutual admiration ahead of their upcoming ICC World Test Championship final at Lord's on June 11. The two veteran spinners, considered among the best in modern cricket, shared their respect for each other's achievements and impact on the sport, particularly in finger spin bowling.Maharaj revealed he had personally congratulated Lyon when the Australian reached his 400th Test wicket milestone, acknowledging his influence on the sport.""I have always been a huge fan of Nathan Lyon. Huge respect, I think, when he got his, was it 400th? I sent him a DM on Instagram saying, you know, thank you for leading the way with regards to fingerspin and making youngsters believe that it is not only leg-spinners that are wanted out there. I mean, what he has done for Australian cricket and to that bowling lineup is probably beyond words,"" Maharaj stated.Lyon reciprocated the appreciation, praising Maharaj's bowling technique and expressing mutual respect.""Yeah, that is obviously very kind words from him. I have had some great chats with Keshav, and the respect goes both ways. Each and every one has got their own journey and the way Maharaj goes about it and the shape that he puts on it is incredible in my eyes,"" Lyon responded.Lyon holds an impressive record as Australia's third-highest wicket-taker with 553 wickets in 136 Tests, maintaining an average of 30.19. His best figures stand at 8/50, with 24 five-wicket hauls and five ten-wicket hauls in his career.Maharaj commended Lyon's cricket intelligence and bowling technique, while Lyon acknowledged Maharaj as an underrated threat in international cricket.""To be honest with you, I think he is actually a massive threat that doesn't get spoken about. I think he is invaluable for Australia,"" Lyon said about Maharaj.Maharaj stands on the brink of two historic achievements. He needs just two more wickets to become the first South African spinner to reach 200 Test wickets and six more to achieve 300 international wickets.The South African spinner has claimed 198 wickets in 57 Tests at an average of 29.68, with his best figures being 9/129. He has also secured 11 five-wicket hauls during his Test career.Quiz: Who's that IPL player?

NEW DELHI: Prior to the ICC World Test Championship final against Australia, AB de Villiers , the former South African batter, has advised the Proteas batting lineup to maintain consistent respect for bowlers throughout all stages of the match at Lord's.The upcoming one-off Test match from June 11-15 marks South Africa's debut appearance in a World Test Championship final against Australia. Their historical record at Lord's spans 18 Tests, resulting in six victories, eight losses and four stalemates.""Lord's is a tricky ground to play at. You've got the ball moving around more than most grounds in the world for a longer period of time. You're never in, and that's probably my best advice to the batters, to sort of respect the bowlers, whether it's the first over or the 67th over. You're never in, so just respect the game,"" de Villiers told Star Sports.""Lord's, you generally want to be a bit fuller as a seam bowler and try and get the best out of the conditions. There's always a bit of seam movement for the seam bowlers. So I would probably urge my bowlers to bowl full and straight for as long as possible,"" he added.Under Temba Bavuma 's leadership, South Africa secured the top position in the 2023-25 WTC rankings, achieving seven consecutive wins against West Indies, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, resulting in a 69.44 points percentage.Lord's will be the third English venue to host the WTC finals, following Southampton's Rose Bowl (2021) and London's The Oval (2023).A reserve day has been allocated for June 16 to compensate for any potential time lost during the scheduled five-day match.","South Africa face Australia in the ICC World Test Championship final at Lord's.

Former England cricketer Alec Stewart has praised young Indian batter Sai Sudharsan's potential for Test cricket, highlighting his quick learning ability and diverse shot selection as key attributes that could help him succeed in the longer format following Virat Kohli's retirement.Sudharsan, who has already represented India in ODIs and T20Is, is eyeing his Test debut during India's upcoming five-Test tour of England starting June 20, which marks the beginning of India's World Test Championship 2025-27 cycle under new captain Shubman Gill.Sudharsan's first-class cricket record shows 1,957 runs in 29 games at an average of 39.93, including seven centuries and five fifties. His highest score stands at 213.His recent performance in the Indian Premier League strengthened his credentials, where he claimed the Orange Cap and Emerging Player of the Season award with 759 runs in 15 matches at an average of 54.21.Surrey's association with Sudharsan began in 2023 when he had played fewer than 10 first-class games and was yet to make his international debut. Before his Surrey debut against Northamptonshire, he played for the team's second XI at Guildford to familiarize himself with English conditions and the Dukes ball.""Sai came as an unknown, and his experience of the English game was very limited. Vikram Solanki was massive in recommending him to me, and I have so much respect for Vikram. From his first training session, you could see that he was a special talent, and he has not looked back. He loves to bat - whether in the nets or the middle - and just fitted into our set-up perfectly,"" Stewart said.Stewart specifically noted Sudharsan's technique in handling English conditions. ""If you go too hard and get too far out in front of yourself, when the ball seams, you are not in control, then your bat can get outside of your eyeline, whereas he plays it under his eyeline, plays it under his eyes, and plays it late. And even if he does nick it a little bit, like Kane Williamson, for example - you can nick it, but it still falls short of slip and that again is a real attribute of Sai's. ""Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Regarding Sudharsan's ability to play on English pitches, Stewart added: ""The pitches are quicker here, certainly at The Oval, and to succeed, you have to be able to play off the back foot. You have got to be selective to pull, hook, cut or let go. He gets out of the line of the short ball well but can also play the uppercut over the slips. He has got a full array of shots, and he gets them in the right order.""Sudharsan's dedication to improvement was evident when he took some Dukes balls back home after his county stint. Stewart commented on this, saying: ""I did not charge him for them and just let him have them. But, no... he had that forward-thinking mindset and trained with those balls, so that when he comes back to us, or hopefully is picked for India on tour, he will have had nice practice against the Dukes cricket ball as well. Some of those will probably be worn out by now because I gave them to him last year, but he is a quick learner and he practises with a purpose. Yes, he likes volume, but he also likes to improve.""Stewart advised Sudharsan against trying to be the next Virat Kohli, suggesting instead that he focus on being the ""best version of Sai Sudharsan.""The five-Test series in England will run from June to August 2025, with matches scheduled across Leeds, Birmingham, London, and Manchester.India's Test squad for the England series includes Shubman Gill as captain, Rishabh Pant as vice-captain, and players like Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Karun Nair, Nitish Reddy, Ravindra Jadeja , Dhruv Jurel, Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, Arshdeep Singh, and Kuldeep Yadav.",Former England cricketer Alec Stewart has praised young Indian batter Sai Sudharsan's potential for Test cricket.

NEW DELHI: After years of near-misses in ICC knockouts, South Africa now have their eyes on history as they prepare to face Australia in the World Test Championship (WTC) Final at Lord’s from June 11.The Proteas bounced back strongly after a shaky start to the WTC 2023-25 cycle, losing three of their first four Tests. However, they turned things around with consistent performances to top the table with eight wins and 100 points.South Africa’s campaign kicked off at home against India, splitting the series 1-1. Dean Elgar’s 185 and a dominant pace attack gave them a crushing win in the first Test, while India hit back in Cape Town after collapsing SA’s batting lineup. Elgar retired after the series.The away tour to New Zealand was a setback. Fielding a second-string side, SA lost 0-2. Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson’s heroics overshadowed performances from Bedingham and Piedt, who still managed individual highs.In the Caribbean, South Africa fought back. A drawn first Test was followed by a thrilling 40-run win in the second. Wiaan Mulder starred with both bat and ball, while Keshav Maharaj claimed the Player of the Series award with 13 wickets.Bangladesh proved a happy hunting ground as SA swept the series 2-0. Rabada was sensational with 14 wickets, while de Zorzi and Kyle Verreynne impressed with the bat. This marked SA’s first Test series win in Asia in a decade.Back home, South Africa dominated Sri Lanka with back-to-back wins.

So, who can Spurs bring in as Ange Postecoglou's replacement?

Poll Do you think Ange Postecoglou deserved the sack despite winning the Europa League title? It's a mistake, he should have stayed. It was the right decision, time for a change.

Mauricio Pochettino is not considering a return to former club Spurs at the moment (Image via X)





Ange Postecoglou, despite his heroics in the UEFA Europa League, leading Tottenham Hotspur to the trophy over rivals Manchester United, has been relieved of his duties. The Australian manager took charge of the club in 2023 and helped them end a 17-year wait for silverware with the win in the Europa League. However, it was not enough to keep him at the club as the club announced its decision to sack their manager.As Postecoglou leaves upon fulfilling a promise - that he usually wins things in his second season - there is discussion on who the club should hire as his replacement. Among his potential replacements is a familiar name in Mauricio Pochettino. The Argentine was in charge of the club from 2014 to 2019, during which he led them to a Champions League final in 2019. Amidst rumors of a return to his former club, the current United States Men's National Team head coach said that a return at this point in time is unrealistic.""Today it's not realistic,"" said Pochettino, 53. ""Look where I am. Look where we (his backroom staff) are. The answer is so clear,"" said the 53-year-old. His current responsibilities and the fact that the USA is preparing to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Mexico and Canada further rules out a surprise return.Thomas Frank : The Brentford head coach is the frontrunner to join Spurs as their new manager. After a series of impressive seasons with The Bees and leading them to two top 10 finishes in the Premier League, the manager has garnered attention from several top clubs.As per reports, the club has already made initial contact to inquire about the 51-year-old. Frank's contract with Brentford runs until the summer of 2027.

Legendary French forward and former Bayern Munich star Franck Ribery took shots at Portuguese skipper Cristiano Ronaldo as the latter made a comment on who he thinks should win the 2025 Ballon d'Or. In a press conference ahead of the UEFA Nations League final, Ronaldo expressed his opinion that the individual honour should be handed to a player whose team participated in the UEFA Champions League final.Ronaldo's comments were in response to a question that sought to elicit the veteran's take on who should win the Ballon d'Or between FC Barcelona's Lamine Yamal and Paris Saint-Germain's Ousmane Dembele. Another frontrunner for the award is Barcelona forward Raphinha, who also leads the tally in goal contributions across Europe's top five leagues.However, Ronaldo's comment was enough to provoke Ribery into a heated reaction, as the Frenchman took to Instagram. ""So you NEED to win the Champions League to win the Ballon d'Or?"", wrote the 42-year-old on his Instagram story.His reaction alludes to the fact that he missed out on the same award despite being part of a Bayern Munich squad that won the treble. In the title-winning campaign, Ribery led the charge alongside Arjen Robben and Mario Mandzukic. Despite a brilliant season, Ribery saw Ronaldo lift the Ballon d'Or after voting for the same was extended.This helped the Portuguese attract more votes owing to his hat-trick against Sweden as his team qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.However, Ronaldo's comment is in contradiction to his own Ballon d'Or triumph, where his side fell in the Champions League 3-4 on aggregate to Borussia Dortmund. Ronaldo's five Ballon d'Or wins are second only to rival Lionel Messi, who has lifted 8 till date.After suggesting that Lamine Yamal should not win the Ballon d'Or, Ronaldo will take him on in the final of the UEFA Nations League as Spain face Portugal at the Allianz Arena in Germany.",Franck Ribery took to Instagram to respond to Cristiano Ronaldo's Ballon d'Or comments.

TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein gained no points on Day 1 of the Shanghai E-Prix last weekend. However, the Formula E driver was able to turn the tables in a rainy race the next day and claim second place on the podium.

The two had started in the same positions on the grid but in reverse order. It was, nevertheless, a double gain for Porsche on Sunday.Talking about the Round 11 race, Wehrlein said, “Very tricky conditions especially in the beginning, I think it got a little bit better towards the end, but our pace was good. Not good enough for P1, but quite far ahead of the guys behind. Personally I’m very happy about the result today because today was the first time that I felt like we were very competitive in the wet, which wasn’t the case in Tokyo and Monaco. I think we’ve found a good way there and in the end a happy ending for us. ”The two also scored double podiums at the Mexico E-Prix and then again in Miami, where Wehrlein won. He earned another podium at the Tokyo E-Prix.With such a strong performance this year, Wehrlein currently holds second place in the Formula E Driver Standings with 103 points.“It was a very strong result today in very tricky and challenging wet conditions,” Porsche Formula E boss Florian Modlinger stated after the double podium in Round 11.

We'd like to address those comments that he made I believe on the team radio. Number one, thank you for the free publicity. We'll take that any day of the week.

He was “all smiles after Race 1” and shared proof of his happy pictures with the trophy on Instagram.Talking to Formula E about the race, Taylor Barnard said, “Honestly, my main emotion is that I’m a bit confused! I was sitting at the back for a very long time; I was quite good on energy but I didn’t understand how the race was playing out. The team did a great job with the strategy because I came out of the pit lane in sixth so I thought, ‘now I can fight!’, but I need to look at the race after to understand a little bit better what’s actually happened. I was really struggling with energy on the last couple of laps so I did my best in the last few corners. I’m super happy to get another podium, another 15 points in the bag.”On Sunday, Barnard finished tenth in the second race of the Shanghai double-header but was glad he finished it safely as he raced on a wet track in the rain.

NEW DELHI: Mohammed Shami 's eagerly awaited return was further postponed as the Indian bowler was left out of India's starting eleven for the opening Twenty20 International match against England because the team management didn't think he would fit in with the lineup given the Eden Gardens track's characteristics.After 14 months, everyone was expecting Shami to return to the national team, but when captain Suryakumar Yadav revealed at the toss that he would not be playing, it stoked rumors that the national selectors were not confident in his fitness. Abhishek Sharma explained after the game that the veteran bowler was benched due to the circumstances and the combinations that the team management deemed suitable.""I feel it's the decision of the team management and they thought it's a better option keeping in mind of these conditions,"" Abhishek said at the post-match press conference in Kolkata.The fresh look of India The T20 team is entirely Gautam Gambhir 's creation, and it has performed remarkably up to this point by concentrating on role-specific conditions rather than celebrity culture conformity.'GamBall' against 'Bazball' was the result of not choosing a bowler of Shami 's caliber, assessing the track, and selecting three specialized spinners and one frontline pacer. It's safe to assume which philosophy won.T20Is haven't been his finest suit, as evidenced by his 11-year international career, in which he played 23 of them with 24 wickets and an economy rate of almost nine runs per over.Gambhir didn't want to put a veteran who had just returned from a 14-month forced international break in a situation where Jos Buttler and company could have considered his length to be cannon fodder.Ironically, the 34-year-old pacer, who appeared to be fully recovered, bowled for about 30 minutes at the side nets, aiming for stumps, while Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav chose to bowl at the toss and declared the playing XI without him.Shami had bowled full throttle at the India nets in every session, despite having a hefty strapping on his left knee.Although Abhishek, one of the younger players in the national team, discussed combination, it is still unclear if the senior pacer is still having issues with a swollen left knee following each demanding practice.Given that captain Suryakumar had voiced confidence in Shami's inclusion during the pre-match media conference, there didn't appear to be any serious concerns regarding his fitness.""It's always good to have an experienced bowler in your side, and he is making a comeback after over a year. I am really excited to see him. I have witnessed his journey-what he did at the NCA, how he focused on his bowling and recovery. It's great to see him fit and back in the side,"" Suryakumar said on Tuesday.Shami himself expressed his desire to make a comeback, highlighting the effort he made to demonstrate his fitness by representing Bengal in all three domestic formats, first with the Ranji Trophy , then the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s, and ending with the Vijay Hazare Trophy.""The hunger to play for the country should never end. If you love it, you will always fight back, no matter how many injuries you face,"" Shami said at a Cricket Association of Bengal event.""No matter how many matches I play, it always feels like less. Once I leave cricket, I may never get this chance again,"" he added during CAB's felicitation ceremony for the victorious Under-15 women's cricketers at Eden Gardens on Monday.Since Sunday, when the camp started, Shami has also been bowling at full throttle after a demanding three-phase exercise that lasted more than an hour.He returned to bowling full force on the eve of the game on Tuesday without experiencing any discernible discomfort.Even though his left knee was always strapped, neither the strength and conditioning coach nor the physiotherapist needed to attend to him.There was only a faint trace of discomfort as he made his way back to the dressing room, taking slow, deliberate movements and appearing to be aware of his left leg.With star pacer Jasprit Bumrah facing a fitness cloud after suffering a back niggle during the fifth Test in Sydney, Shami's return has garnered a lot of attention in the run-up to the Champions Trophy. Ajit Agarkar , the chairman of selectors, also emphasized Shami's importance during last week's Champions Trophy selection announcement in Mumbai.""I don't think his fitness issues were related to white-ball cricket. We were trying to get him to Australia. Unfortunately, his knee didn't allow him to play four-day or five-day cricket.""With white-ball cricket, he has played most of the Syed Mushtaq Ali games and some of the Vijay Hazare games. With uncertainty around Jassi (Bumrah), if Shami is fit and playing regularly, his quality and experience are invaluable,"" Agarkar said.As India look to strike the correct balance before the Champions Trophy, Shami's next chance to demonstrate his preparedness is probably going to come later in the series.","Mohammed Shami was left out of India's starting eleven for the opening Twenty20 International match against England.

NEW DELHI: Abhishek Sharma led an outstanding effort and hit India's second-fastest fifty (in terms of balls faced) against England in the Twenty20 International format at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata.The love affair between Indian left-handers and English bowlers in the Twenty20 International format gained notoriety thanks to Yuvraj Singh 's performances during the 2007 T20 World Cup.Abhishek, who was coached by Yuvraj, demonstrated his power hitting prowess against the English tearaways in the first game of the series. India successfully chased down 133 with more than seven overs remaining thanks to his quick 79 from just 34 deliveries.Abhishek celebrated reaching 50 in just 20 balls during his blitzkrieg, which was the second-fastest score by an Indian during a Twenty20 International match against England.Yuvraj, Abhishek's mentor, is the record holder for the fastest fifty, having reached it in just 12 deliveries in Durban in 2007.

Striking at 232.35, he hit a staggering eight maximums and five fours.After being dropped twice during the game, he was undoubtedly fortunate. During his daring performance, he fired a barrage of boundaries and celebrated his fifty with a spectacular six.He was dropped a second time until his luck finally ran out. His spectacular innings of 79 (34 balls) came to an end when Harry Brook caught him at long-off as he tried to loft a delivery from Adil Rashid.India managed to chase down a meager 133-run mark with 43 balls remaining due to Abhishek's efforts. With the most balls left, this is India's fastest and most successful chase against England in men's Twenty20 Internationals.The fastest successful chase in India with the most balls remaining was in 2012, prior to the record-breaking performance in Kolkata. In Pune, the hosts reached the 158-run mark with 13 balls remaining when India set out to chase it.",Abhishek Sharma hit 79 from just 34 deliveries against England.

NEW DELHI: India captain Suryakumar Yadav commended his team's zeal for being excellent in every facet of the game after they crushed England by seven wickets to take a 1-0 lead in the five-match T20I series .The bowlers put up an incredible display at the Eden Gardens on Wednesday, bowling out England for 132, highlighted by Varun Chakaravarthy 's 3-23. Abhishek Sharma 's 79 in the reply enabled India to reach the 133-run target inside 13 overs.""The energy after we won the toss set the benchmark.

We did the same in South Africa, Hardik had a responsibility to bowl new ball so cushion to play the extra spinner.""""Varun's preparations are on point, and Arshdeep is taking the extra responsibility. There's a lot of freedom given, we want to play a bit different. The fielding is one area we've been working really hard. Let's take those half chances and make a difference,"" said Suryakumar after the match ended.This was the beginning of England's new white-ball era under coach Brendon McCullum , although it ended poorly. Jos Buttler , the captain, acknowledged that the batting performance was not what they had anticipated.""There was a little bit in the wicket early on, probably didn't expect that. It looked like a really good wicket, they found a little bit of movement and we lost a couple of wickets. But if you come through that phase, it's a pretty good pitch and obviously a fast-scoring ground.""""Some really good players in there, we wanted to enforce the game that we want to play and we weren't quite capable of doing that today against some good bowlers but we're better for the run-out and we're looking forward to the next one.""Asked about Jofra Archer 's 2-21, Buttler said, ""He (Jofra Archer) always looks good, he's a superstar, he looked threatening. Thought he could have had a few more wickets there. Mark Wood was bowling fast as well.

We are up against a team who are ultra-aggressive as well, so it's really exciting.""""Venue to venue, you got to assess the conditions and play well. I am really enjoying the environment.

Mohammad Amir 's four-wicket haul and Fakhar Zaman 's undefeated 71 helped the Desert Vipers sail to a decisive victory that solidified their top spot in the rankings.Alex Hales got the Desert Vipers off to a terrific start with a barrage of boundaries, and they wasted no time in their pursuit. Within the first two overs, the team sped to 20/0 after he hit Adam Milne for a maximum and then clobbered Tim Southee for three fours.With some clean hitting, Zaman stepped in, taking aim at Bangladeshi pacer Junaid Siddique in his opening over. He sliced him away for a boundary after crossing the stump, and then he hit a stunning pull shot for four more.Zaman appeared to have a straightforward goal: to prevent the bowlers from settling in. He was in his rhythm. He pursued Ashton Agar and used a huge slog sweep to strike him for a huge six.The Desert Vipers scored 47 runs after five overs when the Pakistani batsman sprinted down the track for the following delivery and smashed it clean past the pitcher. The Sharjah Warriorz were 18/4 at the same point in the first innings.As the required run rate fell below three runs per over and the Desert Vipers' batters reveled in the middle, the disparity in batting became apparent.

NEW DELHI: India spinner Varun Chakravarthy was still eager to get better even after he played a game-winning effort against England in the first Twenty20 International.After being left out of India's Champions Trophy squad, Chakravarthy, the local hero of Kolkata, came back to Eden Gardens to reveal his enigmatic variants against England.By cheaply dismissing the opening combination of Ben Duckett and Phil Salt in the first innings, Arshdeep Singh created the ideal environment for Chakravarthy to express himself.He had plenty of time to con the hard-hitting English middle-order by using techniques from his mystery box. Chakravarthy quickly realized that bounce, not turn, was the key to success on a surface where he has bowled numerous times.""I am used to seeing such pitches in the IPL. I know that it is for the seamers, but I know there are certain lengths which are helpful for me. What I realised was I can't beat batsmen with a side-spin. The only way I can beat the batsmen is through bounce,"" Chakravarthy said after winning the Player of the Match award.His effectiveness was also attributed to keeping the ball away from the hitting arc in addition to removing bounce from the surface. Along with Harry Brook and Liam Livingstone, Chakravarthy caught the big fish during his successful outing: England captain Jos Buttler Chakravarthy performed a counterpunch flawlessly when England threatened with a partnership between Buttler and Brook that looked promising.Livingstone followed young sensation Brook in the dressing room with a two-ball duck in the same over after Brook was initially dismissed for 17.Only how long Buttler could stay on the crease would determine England's chances of reaching the 150-run milestone. Buttler knew he had to monitor the boundary rope as the first innings came to a head.Buttler's innings ended on 68(44) after Nitish Reddy charged in to make a wonderful catch when he attempted to draw the ball away towards deep square leg. Following the captain's dismissal, India easily overtook England, who had crawled up to 132.Chakravarthy returned with astounding figures of 3/23 from his four-over performance, with Buttler's wicket being his last wicket of the game. Despite his game-changing performance that helped India win by seven wickets, he believes more work needs to be done.""I am trying to keep it away from their arc, it was holding a bit. Every over, bowling in Eden is challenging. To bowl to batsmen like Jos and other guys is definitely challenging. The last over was very tricky and challenging, but by God's grace, I was successful. I'm still 7 on 10, still more work to do,"" he added.","India spinner Varun Chakravarthy played a game-winning effort against England in the first Twenty20 International.

The rhythm is very important, everything in life has a flow. Whatever it is, your fitness, mindset and skill is important for bowling. Same goes for the kite as well.""Since playing in the ODI World Cup 2023 final against Australia in Ahmedabad, Shami has not been a part of India's pace attack. After undergoing surgery for an ankle ailment, he missed a year of cricket action.Shami made a spectacular comeback to competitive cricket in the Ranji Trophy last year, helping Bengal win with an inspiring 7/156 against Madhya Pradesh.Shami continues in the video, ""Doesn't matter if it is flying a kite, bowling or driving a car, if you are strong and believe in yourself, then I don't think you will find any difference. Look, even after 15 years, I am able to fly this kite. Hence confidence is important for any task.""The Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and the Vijay Hazare Trophy helped Shami recover his rhythm and convinced the selectors to pick him back for India.Also See: Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 In the Vijay Hazare Trophy, Shami took five wickets in three games, and the seasoned pacer concluded SMAT 2024 with 11 wickets in nine games at an average of 25.36.Shami adds in the video, ""When you are scoring runs and taking wickets, everyone is with you. But the real test is to realize who is with you during your tough times. I waited for an entire year and I worked very hard. There was a sense of fear even while running. It's difficult for any player to get injured after being in full flow, go to the NCA for rehabilitation and then make a comeback. When you go through injuries, I feel you grow stronger as an athlete, because you have to repeat a lot of things while being mentally strong. Whatever is done, it is done. I have crossed that phase. If you work hard, you will get the result. That's what I believe in. Even if we fall, we have to get up and walk again, the same applies to sports too.

NEW DELHI: In light of India's declining performance, Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Snehasish Ganguly supported head coach Gautam Gambhir and believes he should be given more time.The Indian squad has been in ruins ever since Gambhir took over as head coach and started the era with his regime selections, particularly in the Test format.It all began when, for the first time in 27 years, India lost a bilateral ODI series to Sri Lanka. After defeating Bangladesh in the home series, India enjoyed a little breather, but things quickly deteriorated.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 When New Zealand arrived in India, they stunned the hosts with an incredible display. On paper, India was expected to easily defeat the Kiwis in red-ball cricket, particularly at home. However, the home citadel was breached, and India experienced a historic whitewash for the first time in 24 years.A further blow to India's already open wounds was the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .

The duo, who excelled as India’s top run-getters in the 2023 ODI World Cup , remain pivotal to the team’s success despite nearing the twilight of their careers.""Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli holding the tricolor, that picture is etched in my mind,"" Kaif recalled, while speaking on his YouTube channel. ""They looked determined after losing the ODI World Cup final and went on to win the T20 World Cup . You need them for the Champions Trophy . One is 37 years old, another is 36.

NEW DELHI: India's No. 1 Arjun Erigaisi suffered his third defeat during the fourth round of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 in Wijk aan Zee on Tuesday. With only 0.5 points out of the inaugural four rounds, Arjun finds himself at the bottom of the Masters leaderboard, alongside compatriot Leon Luke Mendonca.Playing with the white pieces against Russia’s Vladimir Fedoseev, Arjun opened with the Queen's Gambit Declined (QGD) in a Classical variation. Despite a strong start, Arjun lost the momentum on the 15th move with a costly blunder, Ne2, allowing Fedoseev to seize a pawn with fxg4.A series of three suboptimal moves from Fedoseev briefly gave Arjun hope of a comeback. However, Arjun’s decision to capture a pawn on f5 with his knight proved fatal, as Fedoseev countered with Qxf5, netting a decisive advantage. With 10 minutes still on the clock, Arjun resigned on the 39th move, with Fedoseev up a knight.While Arjun's poor run in the tournament continued at one end of the room, Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu showed no hints of slowing his impressive run, becoming the sole leader of the tournament with a dominant victory over Leon Luke Mendonca. This marked Praggnanandhaa's third win, all against his fellow Indians — Pentala Harikrishna, Arjun Erigaisi, and now Mendonca.In a game featuring the Ruy-Lopez (Spanish Opening), Praggnanandhaa displayed exceptional precision, playing with a remarkable 94.3% accuracy.In a daring sequence, he sacrificed his queen with Rxe4, decisively dismantling Mendonca's defensive setup. Leon eventually resigned on the 46th move as Praggnanandhaa's relentless play left him with no hope of recovery.With this win, and a draw between Nodirbek Abdusattorov and Wei Yi, Praggnanandhaa now leads the tournament standings with 3.5/4 and climbs to World No. 8 in the live rankings.Pentala Harikrishna had a quick and efficient day, finishing his game in just 23 moves against the Netherlands’ Max Warmerdam.Despite a misstep on the 21st move (Rf3+), which briefly handed the advantage to Max, a subsequent blunder by Warmerdam (Kg6) sealed his fate, allowing Harikrishna to claim the win. Harikrishna’s performance was nearly flawless, with a 92.9% accuracy score.In another encounter, World No. 2 Fabiano Caruana, playing white, and Dutch No. 1 Anish Giri battled to a subtle 36-move draw. Meanwhile, D. Gukesh played out a gruelling 70-move draw against Alexey Sarana in an intense battle.In the Challengers section, Vaishali Rameshbabu scored a comfortable victory against Nodirbek Yakubboev. Divya Deshmukh, playing with the white pieces, displayed her attacking acumen to secure her first win of the tournament against Ediz Gurel.After struggling in the initial rounds, this win raises the question of whether Divya can turn her campaign around in the upcoming games.Elsewhere, 15-year-old Miaoyi Lu held Irina Bulmaga to a draw, maintaining her position at the top of the table along with Thai Dai van Nguyen and Erwin l'Ami.",India's No. 1 Arjun Erigaisi suffered his third defeat during the fourth round of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 in Wijk aan Zee on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: India batter Sanju Samson came out all guns blazing in pursuit of 133 in the first T20I against England at Eden Gardens , unleashing a blistering assault on Gus Atkinson and scoring 22 runs off his first over with four fours and a magnificent six.The first delivery was short, and Samson was ready. He leaned back slightly, pulling it with finesse behind square for a boundary. The crowd erupted. Atkinson's next ball, a good length outside off, was met with a perfectly timed on-the-rise drive, racing through extra cover for another four.The third ball of the over was the only dot delivery, with Samson slashing hard for a cut but missing as the ball bounced over the blade.Atkinson, visibly under pressure, overcorrected his length on the fourth ball. Samson seized the opportunity, stepping forward and throwing his bat at the ball. The sound of the bat meeting the ball was crisp, and it soared over the covers for a magnificent six.Determined to recover, Atkinson tried a back-of-a-length delivery outside off. Samson slashed hard, but the ball zipped over his blade. Atkinson seemed to regain his footing for a moment.But Samson wasn't done. A fuller delivery followed, and Samson whipped it to the right of mid-on, showcasing his elegant wristwork as the ball sped to the fence. Atkinson's final delivery strayed onto the pads, and Samson glanced it delicately past short fine leg, leaving deep square leg with no chance.However, Samson failed to keep the momentum going as he perished for 26 off 20 balls.Earlier, India bowled out the tourists for 132 as England skipper Jos Buttler played a lone hand with his 68.Left-arm fast bowler Arshdeep Singh removed both openers early and spinner Varun Chakravarthy claimed three wickets after India elected to field first in Kolkata.","Sanju Samson scored 22 runs off his first over with four fours and a magnificent six.

Already employed with Delhi Audit , and with ITI. He was one of the first players to be signed on contract by the Bangalore outfit as it rejigged its rules to allow for two outstation players, or ‘guest players’ as they were officially labelled.It was here that a tweak was made to his positional nature that would immediately further his prospects as a footballer. Partly due to a crowded midfield at ITI, and largely due to his left-footed passing and fondness for playing from the deep, Rishi was converted into a defender at left-back. It may have stifled a bit of his creativity, but his game-reading lent solidity to the defence. His performances at ITI led to Mohun Bagan taking notice.“We’ve lost a very good player today. This is no time to go,” Debjit Ghosh, teammate when Bagan won the title in 2002, told TOI from Kolkata. “When we first saw him at ITI, he was playing as left-back and he really impressed our coach, Subrata Bhattacharya. Much later after we signed him, we realized that he was a natural playmaker, but we needed him in defence. He and I struck up a very fine understanding on the field,” said the ex-India player.Former India international Renedy Singh too recalled their days together at Bagan. “Back then, it was normal that the clubs would never pay us on time. We would seldom have money, but we loved the local kebabs. I remember Rishi, Lolendra (Singh) and me literally scrounging money from here and there just to go Eliot Road and have kebabs,” said Renedy, “He was a very forthright person, probably that may have rubbed some people the wrong way but I remember him very, very fondly.”Despite a national title and the promise of further professional exposure, Rishi left Bagan to return to Delhi’s Hindustan. “He stayed just a few seasons with us. He wanted to return to keep his job,” remembered Ghosh. It was perhaps this mindset – of saving the job -- that probably cost the Delhi footballer an India call-up. Stephen Constantine, the then India coach, was impressed by Kapoor’s versatility on the left channel, but chose to ignore him because he rightly felt that Delhi’s football didn’t offer a high level of intensity and competitiveness.With his job safe, Kapoor enjoyed brief stints with Salgaocar and Sesa in Goa but always returned to establish himself as an Ambedkar Stadium fixture. A decade later, after his first move, as Delhi football would change character, moving away from the Walled City into the suburbs, Rishi Kapoor would be the symbol of change. Playing for newly-formed Delhi United, he would toy with much-younger footballers, effortlessly doing it even at 35.","Rishi Kapoor, the first Delhi footballer to win a national football league title, passed away in a city hospital on Monday. He was 49 and had reportedly been suffering from liver-related issues.Primarily a left-footed midfielder with fine passing ability and a thunderous shot, Kapoor spearheaded Hindustan FC’s rise.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117404699,imgsize-19072,width-400,resizemode-4/117404699.jpg"

""Today he put his mark on the game.""Liverpool also have a game in hand over the injury-hit Arsenal, whose title hopes took another blow at the Emirates Stadium.Gabriel Martinelli's effort crossed the line despite Emi Martinez's efforts, giving Arsenal a deserved first-half lead.Kai Havertz's shot also found the back of the net, despite Martinez getting a touch on it.However, Villa staged a comeback through Youri Tielemans' header, and the Belgian midfielder nearly leveled the score moments later when his shot hit the post.Ollie Watkins equalised for the visitors 22 minutes from time, cushioning in Matty Cash's cross off the underside of the crossbar.""Today we cannot concede the two goals we did after everything we did,"" said Arteta. ""That line is so thin.

Griezmann blows penalty

Barcelona were held to a 1-1 draw by Getafe in La Liga on Saturday, failing to make up ground on the top two teams in the Spanish title race.Jules Kounde gave Barcelona an early lead, but Mauro Arambarri equalised for Getafe in the first half, and the Catalans were unable to break down Jose Bordalas' well-organised team.The draw leaves Barcelona in third place, five points behind league leaders Atletico Madrid, who suffered a 1-0 defeat at Leganes earlier in the day.Despite winning the Spanish Super Cup last week and thrashing Real Betis in the Copa del Rey, suggesting a return to form after a slump in late 2024, Barcelona dropped two points on the road in their first league match of 2025 against 16th-placed Getafe.""It's not done yet, we still have some matches to play and as I said before, we will fight until the end,"" Flick told reporters.""Today it's one point more, not two points less. We missed (out on) two points, but we have to look forwards and make it better next time.""Flick fielded his strongest side in recent weeks, hoping to secure a result at Getafe, where Barcelona had failed to score in their previous four away visits.The Blaugrana ended that streak in the ninth minute when Kounde, who also scored in the midweek Copa del Rey win against Real Betis, was cleverly set up by Pedri and scored on the rebound after David Soria saved his initial effort.However, Barcelona faced the same difficulties they have often encountered at the Coliseum, with Getafe digging in and denying top scorer Robert Lewandowski any space.Getafe equalized in the 34th minute when Coba's shot was parried by Barcelona goalkeeper Inaki Pena, and Arambarri pounced to score.The hosts maintained their tight defensive setup in the second half, making life difficult for Barcelona.Raphinha missed a golden opportunity to win the game for Barca in the closing minutes, hitting the side netting from close range after being found by Lamine Yamal's cross.""It was a shame, the match, we had control of the game and with one chance they scored one goal against us, it's a shame,"" Kounde told Movistar.After the match, Barcelona defender Alejandro Balde reported being subjected to racist abuse from some home supporters during the first half.On Sunday, Spanish and European champions Real Madrid, currently second in La Liga, host Las Palmas with the aim of moving to the top of the table.In another surprise result, league leaders Atletico Madrid suffered a shock defeat at Leganes, ending their club record run of 15 consecutive victories.Matija Nastasic headed Leganes in front early in the second half, and Antoine Griezmann missed a late penalty, dragging his effort wide, as Atletico fell to their second league defeat of the season.""I thought we were low on energy, it wasn't enough from us,"" Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak told DAZN.""We'll keep our head up after (winning) 15 games, we lost this one and we have to keep going forwards... unfortunately the streak is over.""Leganes, 15th in the table, defended well to keep Atletico at bay in the first half, with Julian Alvarez and Griezmann hitting the woodwork.Nastasic's header from a corner put Leganes ahead early in the second half, and they protected their lead without much trouble until controversially conceding a penalty for a debatable handball by Sergio Gonzalez.Griezmann took responsibility from the spot but rolled his 90th-minute effort wide of the goal.Atletico must now regroup in the Champions League, where they aim to reach the knockout rounds, as they face Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday.""They were 15 extraordinary games, I feel enormously proud at having set the (consecutive) winning record in Atletico's history,"" Atletico coach Diego Simeone told DAZN.""We have to accept that defeat is part of the game and prepare ourselves for Tuesday.""","Barcelona held to a 1-1 draw by Getafe in La Liga on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Darwin Nunez delivered a late heroics to fire Liverpool back into Premier League title contention with a dramatic stoppage-time brace, securing a hard-fought 2-0 victory over Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium on Saturday.Liverpool entered the match desperate to end a run of two consecutive league draws, and Nunez, who had struggled for form with just four goals in 26 appearances this season, emerged as the unlikely hero. The Uruguayan's double lifted the Reds seven points clear of second-placed Arsenal, though the Gunners have an opportunity to close the gap with a win over Aston Villa later in the day.The result provided a massive boost to Arne Slot ’s side, who remain in control of their title destiny with a game in hand. It also marked Liverpool’s first league win in three games, after a series of disappointing results that included a draw against Nottingham Forest and a League Cup semi-final first-leg defeat to Tottenham.Brentford, boasting the joint-best home record in the Premier League, made life difficult for the visitors early on. The Bees nearly took the lead when Mikkel Damsgaard failed to convert Mads Roerslev's inviting ball across the six-yard box. Bryan Mbeumo also tested Alisson Becker with a fierce drive from the edge of the area.Liverpool, meanwhile, created a host of chances but were thwarted by Brentford’s resilient defense and in-form goalkeeper Mark Flekken. Dominik Szoboszlai came agonizingly close to breaking the deadlock, smashing a 25-yard strike against the crossbar, while Cody Gakpo and Luis Diaz both missed opportunities to find the net.In the second half, Brentford continued to threaten on the counter, with Alisson twice denying Mbeumo and Nathan Collins making a crucial goal-line clearance to keep Salah's deflected shot out.With time running out and frustration building, Slot turned to Nunez, bringing him on alongside Andrew Robertson. The move paid off spectacularly in stoppage time. Trent Alexander-Arnold delivered a pinpoint cross, and Nunez calmly slotted home from close range, sparking wild celebrations on the Liverpool bench.Moments later, Nunez struck again, this time latching onto Harvey Elliott’s perfectly weighted pass and rifling a fierce shot past Flekken to seal the win. The Uruguayan’s decisive contributions silenced his critics and ensured Liverpool stayed firmly in the title race.For Brentford, the defeat marked a missed opportunity to capitalize on Liverpool's recent struggles. Thomas Frank's men, who had shown resilience in their 2-2 draw with Manchester City earlier in the week, were left to rue missed chances and late lapses in concentration.Liverpool’s victory not only ended their mini-slump but also sent a statement to their title rivals. With Nunez rediscovering his scoring touch, the Reds are primed for a strong push in the second half of the season.",Darwin Nunez scores stoppage-time brace as Liverpool beat Brentford 2-0.

NEW DELHI: Justin Kluivert delivered a sensational performance with a hat-trick as Bournemouth ended Newcastle 's winning streak in emphatic fashion, securing a dominant 4-1 victory at St. James’ Park on Saturday.The result propelled Bournemouth into the Premier League 's top six while halting Newcastle’s bid for a club-record 10th consecutive win across all competitions.The Cherries, now unbeaten in 11 matches, stunned the Magpies with their relentless energy and clinical finishing. Kluivert, the son of former Newcastle striker Patrick Kluivert , stole the spotlight before Milos Kerkez added the finishing touch with a late fourth goal in stoppage time.Newcastle, still in fourth place, saw their cushion over Bournemouth in the race for a Champions League spot shrink to just one point. The defeat also ended Alexander Isak’s remarkable scoring streak, as the Swedish striker, who had scored in eight consecutive Premier League games, was effectively neutralized by Bournemouth's resolute defense.Andoni Iraola’s Bournemouth started brightly, dominating from the first whistle. They nearly went ahead in the opening minutes when Dango Ouattara’s shot was saved by Martin Dubravka, and Antoine Semenyo blasted the rebound over the bar. Just two minutes later, they found the breakthrough as Semenyo’s cut-back was clinically swept into the far corner by Kluivert.Though Newcastle managed to briefly equalize through Bruno Guimarães, who headed in Lewis Hall’s corner, Bournemouth restored their lead before halftime. Kluivert doubled his tally with a composed finish from Ouattara’s precise pass, leaving the hosts reeling.The second half saw Bournemouth continue to dominate, with chances falling their way. Ouattara had a goal disallowed following a VAR review, and David Brooks was denied by a combination of Dubravka and the post.Unlike their midweek disappointment against Chelsea, where they conceded a stoppage-time equalizer, Bournemouth ensured there would be no repeat this time.Kluivert completed his hat-trick with a stunning strike from outside the box, marking his second treble of the season—though this one was particularly special as all three goals came from open play, unlike his hat-trick of penalties against Wolves in November.Milos Kerkez then capped off the victory in style, drilling home Bournemouth’s fourth. The 19-year-old Hungarian left-back, rumored to be on the radar of Liverpool and Manchester United, added insult to injury for Newcastle with his impressive strike.The defeat marked a humbling afternoon for Eddie Howe’s men, who were thoroughly outplayed in front of their home crowd. Meanwhile, Bournemouth’s stunning form continues to raise expectations as they make a push for European football.",Justin Kluivert scores hat-trick as Bournemouth beat Newcastle 4-1 at St. James' Park.

NEW DELHI: Manchester City star Erling Haaland on Friday signed a new contract with the Premier League champions that will keep him at the club until 2034.City announced the nine and a half year extension for the 24-year-old striker, who has netted an impressive 111 goals in 126 matches since his arrival from Borussia Dortmund in 2022.The extension marks the longest contract in the league's history, surpassing the nine-year agreement Cole Palmer signed with Chelsea last year. Haaland’s salary is reportedly set at £500,000 ($610,000) per week.Haaland, who joined City in 2022, made an immediate impact by scoring 52 goals across all competitions in his debut season. His stellar performances helped the club secure a historic treble, winning the Champions League, Premier League, and FA Cup. He continued his remarkable form last season, netting 38 goals and contributing to the team’s fourth consecutive league title.""I am really happy to have signed my new contract and to be able to look forward to spending even more time at this great club,"" said a joyous Haaland.""Manchester City is a special club, full of fantastic people with amazing supporters, and it's the type of environment that helps bring the best out of everybody.""I also want to thank Pep (Guardiola), his coaching staff, my team-mates and everyone at the club as they have all helped me so much in the past couple of years.

NEW DELHI: Amad Diallo's remarkable 12-minute hat-trick rescued Manchester United from a potentially embarrassing defeat against struggling Southampton at Old Trafford on Thursday.The visitors, who are battling to avoid finishing the season as the worst team in Premier League history, took a deserved lead through Manuel Ugarte's own goal late in the first half.Southampton had numerous opportunities to extend their advantage, with Ivan Juric's side playing with confidence and intensity. However, Diallo's introduction in the second half proved to be a game-changer for the hosts.The young forward equalised in the 82nd minute, capitalising on a defensive lapse to score his first goal. Eight minutes later, he latched onto a clever pass from Christian Eriksen to put United ahead.Deep into stoppage time, Diallo completed his hat-trick, taking advantage of another defensive mistake from the visitors.The 3-1 victory provided a much-needed boost for Manchester United, who had endured three consecutive Premier League defeats prior to this match.It also lifted them to 12th in the table, while Southampton remained 10 points adrift of safety.Despite the eventual scoreline, Southampton's performance was commendable, as they caused numerous problems for United's defence throughout the match.Kamaldeen Sulemana was particularly impressive, tormenting the home side's right-back with his pace and trickery.Ruben Amorim's decision to introduce Diallo and make other attacking substitutions proved to be a masterstroke, as the forward's clinical finishing ultimately secured all three points for Manchester United in a match that appeared to be slipping away from them.","Manchester United beat Southampton 3-1 at Old Trafford on Thursday.

Kylian Mbappe 's notable performance included a controversial opening goal, followed by Vinicius contributing to Madrid's lead.However, Celta Vigo's persistence paid off with Jonathan Bamba's late goal and Marcos Alonso 's penalty in stoppage time, pushing the game into extra time.In the additional period, Madrid displayed their offensive strength with Endrick scoring his second, Fede Valverde adding another, and Endrick sealing the win with a backheel goal.""This is Madrid, you fight until the end to win,"" said Endrick.

The Times of India in Melbourne:

Alex de Minaur had produced his best tennis to make the Australian Open quarterfinal, but on Rod Laver Arena on Wednesday, playing before an adoring full-house that called out to him, cheering him on, ‘let’s go Demon, let’s go’, the world No. 8 threw up his arms in frustration, he shook his head and gestured at his box, but there was no respite, the barrage coming at him from across the net was relentless.World No. 1 Jannik Sinner may not have silenced the voluble crowd, who were firmly behind the home hope, but he owned the last-eight clash, taking it by the scruff, to score a 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 win in one-hour and 48-minutes.Sinner won 32 of 38 points on his first serve and 17 of 21 on his second, against one of the better returns in the game, so complete was the Italian’s dominance that he clocked 27 winners.The world no.8, who recorded his best Australian Open result, by reaching the quarterfinals this year, said of his opponent, “He was bl#$dy good tonight.”The defending champion, who struggled against Holger Rune in the fourth round, taking a 11-plus minute medical timeout and getting treated by the doctor, revealed that he hadn’t woken up feeling his best on Monday.The 23-year-old had refused to go into the details, only going so far as to say the hot, humid conditions were not ideal for him.On Wednesday there was talk around the grounds that Sinner might withdraw from the tournament as he wasn’t on the practice schedule, but as it turned out, the top-seed enjoyed an indoor session warming-up for the late-evening match.Sinner said he was able to recover with sleep and a light 30-minute hit with his coaches Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi.The Italian, who watched the entire Carlos Alcaraz-Novak Djokovic quarterfinal on Tuesday, woke up this morning and typed out a message to his team saying, ‘I’m ready for today’.“I feel like today I was feeling everything,” Sinner said. “When you break so early in each set it's a bit easier. But he's a tough competitor, an amazing player. So many people came here for him tonight, it was an amazing atmosphere. Thank you, guys for being so fair.”Sinner, who enjoyed a 9-0 record against De Minaur coming into the last-eight clash, said, “We know each other quite well. We played so many times, we know each other's game so we try to prepare in the best possible way. These matches can go quickly, but things can change fast.""Sinner’s form is sizzling -- he has only lost one match from mid-August and none since October, in that period he has won two masters 1000s, the ATP Finals , US Open and Davis Cup, the only match he has lost in the time was to Carlos Alcaraz in the final in Beijing.In Friday’s second semifinal Sinner will play the charismatic American Ben Shelton , who put out Italian Lorenzo Sonego 6-4, 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (4) earlier on Wednesday.",World No. 1 Jannik Sinner beats Alex de Minaur in straight sets.

NEW DELHI: Defending champion Jannik Sinner dashed home hopes on Wednesday with a commanding straight-set victory over Alex de Minaur to secure a spot in the Australian Open semi-finals against Ben Shelton .The Italian world number one showed no signs of the illness that troubled him in his previous match, storming past the eighth seed 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 on Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne.Sinner’s emphatic win keeps his title defense alive as he eyes a place in Sunday’s final against either 10-time champion Novak Djokovic or second seed Alexander Zverev.Shelton, the 21st seed, earned his semi-final berth by overcoming Italy’s unseeded Lorenzo Sonego in a hard-fought battle, winning 6-4, 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (7/4). The American, making his first Australian Open last-four appearance, now faces Sinner for a chance at the title.The outcome seemed inevitable for De Minaur, who had lost all nine of his previous encounters with Sinner. The Italian also boasts an impeccable record against Australian players, with 20 consecutive wins.There were doubts about Sinner’s fitness after he struggled with illness in his last-16 match, where he admitted feeling dizzy in the sweltering heat. However, the cooler conditions of the quarter-final saw him in peak form, moving effortlessly and showing no signs of discomfort.Roared on by a partisan home crowd, De Minaur initially held his own, but Sinner seized control with a decisive break for a 3-1 lead after an intense 24-shot rally. From there, Sinner’s powerful baseline game and precise ball-striking left the Australian scrambling. De Minaur managed just four winners in the opening set as Sinner dictated play.The second set followed a similar script, with Sinner immediately breaking serve and dominating the exchanges. A stunning forehand winner earned him another break as he raced through the set in just 40 minutes, leaving De Minaur visibly frustrated.Despite his best efforts, De Minaur had no answers in the third set. A string of unforced errors saw him broken twice, with Sinner cruising to a 3-0 lead before wrapping up the match.Sinner, who defeated Daniil Medvedev in last year’s final, is aiming to become the first Italian man to win three Grand Slam titles. He also claimed the US Open crown in 2023 and is now bidding to defend a major title for the first time.Awaiting Sinner in Friday’s semi-final is 22-year-old Shelton, who has rapidly established himself as a rising star. The American reached his first Grand Slam semi-final at the US Open in 2023, where he was stopped by Djokovic.Against Sonego, Shelton relied on his booming serve, including a 232kph (144mph) ace—the fastest of the tournament. After taking the first two sets, Shelton endured a wobble in the third but regrouped to win a tense fourth-set tiebreak.Reflecting on his win, Shelton was unfazed about his next opponent. ""If it’s the home favorite Alex de Minaur, you can boo me, throw stuff at me. I get it,"" Shelton joked with the crowd. ""If it’s the world number one, probably the same thing.

As their careers grew, they became rivals on the ATP Tour, fighting for the same prize.The mutual admiration and respect was the reason why Murray said yes when Djokovic asked if he would coach him late last year.Djokovic said the 'hug' at the end of near four-hours in the middle was instinctive, something he felt he should do.""I feel more and more connected with Andy every day. We face challenges every single day,"" the Serb said. ""People don't see that obviously. We try to make the most out of every day and grow together. He's been as committed to my career as he can be.""Murray, one of the more volatile players on the court in his time, is a rock-like presence at courtside.""It (the hug) was a gesture of appreciation and respect for him, the fact that he's out there, and he doesn't need to be,"" Djokovic said. ""He accepted to work with me, he's giving all his support to me, to the whole team, and trying to make it work.""""This was a huge win for all of us, Andy and myself, for the relationship.

The Times of India in Melbourne:

Iga Swiatek is where she should be in late January, in the semi-finals of the Australian Open . The World No.2, who has dropped just 14 games in the tournament so far, is as crisp as a minted banknote.Swiatek, aiming to go further than her best showing in Melbourne Park, when she made the semi-final in 2022, is up against American Madison Keys , who is in her third semi-final here and hoping to make it third time lucky. Thursday's first semi final pits best friends on the Tour Paula Badosa against world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka .Keys, ranked 19, came through her quarterfinal encounter with a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over the No.28th seed Elina Svitolina . Keys’ 49 winners unlocked the contest after the American fell behind early in the match.Swiatek, who was on court for 89 minutes on Wednesday, eased past the No.8 seed Emma Navarro 6-1, 6-2 using her solid all-round game to outplay the American.Keys trails Swiatek 1-4 in head-to-head clashes.“Iga is tough to beat because she plays with a lot of spin on both sides, she’s a good server, returner and moves incredibly well,” the 29-year-old American said. “The biggest thing that makes her so difficult to beat is, if you miss your spot even slightly, she has enough time to recover, and then the point goes back to neutral.”Swiatek, who likes to keep her opponents on the move, makes it difficult for players to get into a dominant position against her on the court.“Most of us are not really going to try to out-defend Iga,” the American said. “So then there's a balance of being aggressive and trying to get her to move, but not pressing too hard and not going for anything too quickly. She does such a good job of making people start going for too much too quickly.”Swiatek the hardest player in the women’s draw to put away, courtesy her solidity, could be tested by Keys’ aggressive play.“She likes to play intensely and pretty fast,” Swiatek said of the 29-year-old. “She uses her power, especially on a faster hard court. I need to be ready and be proactive.”Swiatek, 23, who has three bagels and an equal number of breadsticks so far in the tournament, is scrooge-like in the way she competes.“On the tennis court, you kind of need to be ruthless,” she said, adding, “Maybe it looks ruthless, but it's not my goal to do that. I just want to win more and more games.”“I think for me focusing on myself and having the same kind of attitude no matter what the score is important. This is what I base my consistency on, the way I just continue to do the good things on the court,” the Pole said.Swiatek, who worships at the altar of consistency and routine, believes those traits have got her to where she is in the tournament.“Sometimes it's the draw, sometimes how tired I am, sometimes the stress level. It's always a different story and a different journey,” said Swiatek of her struggle in previous years in the season’s opening Grand Slam .“These tournaments are long. Even if you start amazing, something can happen during the two weeks,” she said. “I wouldn't say something feels super different (this time). Probably, I'm just relaxed and just focused on the right things. I don't have anything that is disturbing me.”","Iga Swiatek will face Madison Keys in the Australian Open semi-finals.

NEW DELHI: Iga Swiatek 's dominant run at the Australian Open has been impressive, but a controversial moment occurred during her quarterfinal match against Emma Navarro .In a crucial point, Swiatek appeared to fail to reach a ball before it bounced twice, but the chair umpire did not call a fault, allowing play to continue.This incident reignited the debate over the use of video reviews in tennis . Navarro expressed frustration over the lack of video review, believing that players should be allowed to review such instances even if they continue playing the point.She argued that in the heat of the moment, it's difficult to determine whether a double bounce occurred, and video review could provide clarity.""It happened so fast,"" Navarro said. ""You hit the shot, and she hits it back, and you're just, like, 'Oh, I guess I'm playing'. In the back of your head you're like, 'Okay, maybe I can still win the point even though it wasn't called. It's going to be a downer if I stop the point and it turns out it wasn't a double bounce'. It's tough. I think we should be able to see it afterwards and make that call.""Swiatek, on the other hand, admitted that she was unsure whether the ball had bounced twice or if she had hit it with her frame.""I wasn't sure if it was a double bounce or I hit it with my frame (of the racquet). It was hard to say because I was full sprinting,"" said the five-time Grand Slam champion. ""I don't remember even seeing the contact point. I don't know. Sometimes you don't really look when you hit the ball. I thought this is like the umpire's kind of job to call it.

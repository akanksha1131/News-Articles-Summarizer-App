Champions Trophy prep: Team India begins training at ICC Academy ahead of Bangladesh clash | EXCLUSIVE VISUALS

Feel of the ball

Mission Champions Trophy gets underway as Team India lands in Dubai

Arshdeep's zen mode

About fifteen minutes before the team bus was parked outside the ICC Academy in Dubai, Virat Kohli went to the local manager and made some requests. The manager patiently heard the star batter and walked to the main entrance. When he returned, there was a big paper bag from a popular food joint which had few boxes of Kohli's post-session meal. While the others packed their kit bags after more than three hours of intense training, Kohli was refueling and even saved a box for the road.It was the Indian cricket team's first hit ahead of the Champions Trophy and the side hit the ground less than 12 hours after landing in Dubai on February 15. The session started with a unique drill where a tennis ball was hit way up into the air and a player, with the helmet on, had to rebound it off his head and one of the surrounding fielders were waiting to catch it to earn a point. Some points and lots of fun and games later, serious business got underway.Kohli was one of the first batters to scratch the popping crease and he had Rohit Sharma and Hardik Pandya for company in the adjacent nets. One had just throwdowns, the other featured quicks Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Shami while the corner-most was the spin net with Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav bowling. Pandya went bang-bang and Shreyas Iyer continued with similar approach as fireworks were underway when the two were batting. ""Watch the ball, watch it, ball incoming,"" the support staff kept screaming warnings for the security personnel and media near the ropes as the big hits didn't stop.The adjacent nets were quiet on that front as both Kohli and Rohit were happy to get a feel of the ball. There weren't many deliveries in that outside-off channel to Kohli as the right-hander was mostly fed the stump line. Some creaming flicks, on-drives and lofted drives later, he grew in confidence and even showcased his range off the back-foot. The crisp pulls and slashes square off the wicket were on display as he batted for close to an hour. Similarly, Rohit was happy to feel the middle of the blade and was even tested on a few occasions by Arshdeep Singh's incoming deliveries and the occasional yorker.Throughout the session, the intensity from both the batters and bowlers didn't drop an inch as Arshdeep and Shami bowled for close to an hour at full tilt, and the batters were at it even while taking turns on different surfaces. Head coach Gautam Gambhir was stationed right behind the nets as action unfolded and there was a moment of concern in the afternoon when Rishabh Pant was doing his wicketkeeping drills. Pandya slash hit Pant on the left knee and he was down on the ground the next moment.The physios and medical team rushed to give him immediate attention as he grimaced in pain. It was the same knee which received a lot of damage during the horrific accident few years back and immediate ice treatment was necessitated by the blow with Pant flat on the ground. Some time later, he was up on his feet and limped towards the rope before he was interrupted by Pandya who checked on him and gave a hug. After some more treatment, Pant had his knee heavily strapped.All this while, Pant continued to smile and to everyone's surprise started padding up for a hit. He limped to the nets but that didn't affect his big hitting. The left-hander batted without any visible discomfort but he was limped when he made his way back to the change room. The limping continued when he boarded the team bus as well but the smile never left his face. Pant as usual!Something unusual, however, happened towards the end of the session as Arshdeep, after a really long spell, switched to zen mode when he took a book out and started reading. Others around him continued to be chatty and noisy but the youngster was so engrossed in his book that he only left the chair when the manager signalled the players to start walking to the bus.On expected lines, a massive crowd had assembled to catch a glimpse of their favourite stars and Kohli had to momentarily ditch his food box to sign autographs for the waiting fans who created a buzzing atmosphere before the team could finally make their way back to the hotel.","Team India hit the ground less than 12 hours after landing in Dubai on February 15.

Mission Champions Trophy gets underway as Team India lands in Dubai

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh has dismissed the hype around the much-anticipated India-Pakistan clash in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy , calling it an ""overhyped game"" and predicting that India will dominate their arch-rivals in Dubai on February 23. India, placed in Group A, will face co-hosts Pakistan in their second match of the tournament, which begins on February 19.Harbhajan, speaking on his YouTube channel, pointed to India's superior squad strength and Pakistan’s recent inconsistency to support his claim that the game is unlikely to be competitive. ""This India-Pakistan game is an overhyped game because there is nothing in it. India is a very strong team. Pakistan recently lost against New Zealand while playing at home. Pakistan is a very inconsistent team, and if you look at their statistics and compare them with Indian batsmen and bowlers, you will get a clear picture,"" he stated.While acknowledging that past performances do not guarantee future results, Harbhajan reiterated his stance that India are far superior. ""When I look at both teams, the difference is very high. India's team looks too strong. Pakistan’s team appears weak apart from Babar [Azam] and [Mohammad] Rizwan. If we talk about Babar and Rizwan, then apart from them, no other batsman stands out. Their bowling unit is also not in form.""Harbhajan, however, identified Fakhar Zaman as a key player for Pakistan who could pose a threat to India. ""I have taken out some statistics. Their main batsman, Babar, has an average of 31 against India. A top batsman should have an average around 50. Rizwan has an average of 25 against India. Fakhar is the only opener who has a solid average of 46. He can take the game away from India. But beyond that, their batting does not inspire confidence. Faheem Ashraf’s average is 12.5, and Saud Shakeel’s is just six against India. When I look at that batting lineup, I do not feel confident that this team can fight against India.""The former cricketer also pointed out that most of India's key players are in strong form ahead of the tournament. ""India is very strong. Rohit [Sharma] has just scored runs, [Shubman] Gill has scored runs, Axar Patel is in form. [Virat] Kohli recently scored a fifty. Although he is not in the form we are used to seeing, I believe he will succeed because he always performs in big tournaments. KL Rahul’s form is also good.""Harbhajan further compared the teams’ recent performances, emphasising that India’s bowling attack is in good rhythm. ""If we look at our bowlers, their form is good. We recently defeated England in a home series, while Pakistan lost to New Zealand at home. New Zealand will play Pakistan in their opening match, and I think New Zealand will defeat them once again because they know how to bat first and set a strong total. Pakistan won an ODI series in Australia, which should have given them confidence, but they have not looked different since. Rizwan’s captaincy is good, his intent is good, but maybe the players they have are not strong enough. Babar has not scored runs, and although Rizwan and Salman Agha have hit centuries here and there, the team does not inspire confidence. Even in Pakistan, their former players say that India is far ahead.""He also touched on the high ticket prices for the match, suggesting that fans may not get the competitive encounter they expect. ""The prices of tickets have increased a lot, but I don't think the game will be as exciting as people are expecting. In this overhyped game on February 23, I think it will be a one-sided game.""Looking beyond the marquee clash, Harbhajan expressed his belief that India are strong contenders to win the tournament and also praised Afghanistan as a potential dark horse. ""India is far ahead in this match-up and is a very capable team that can win this Champions Trophy. The other team I think will play very well in this tournament is Afghanistan, as they will thrive in these conditions.""India will be aiming to capture their third Champions Trophy title, while Pakistan, the defending champions from the 2017 edition, will look to prove their critics wrong. However, according to Harbhajan Singh, the gap between the two teams is simply too large for an upset to happen.","Harbhajan Singh has dismissed the hype around the much-anticipated India- Pakistan clash in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy.

Vantika Agrawal: The making of a champion

Vantika Agrawal is a three-time gold medalist at the Chess Olympiad. (Image: Instagram)

""A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step"" is a saying mined by Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu.For Vantika Agrawal , it was the simple, yet mesmerising, sight of chess pieces gliding across the 64 squares that set her on a path to preeminence.From a wide-eyed child fascinated by the knight’s unique hop to standing tall as a double gold medallist at the 2024 Chess Olympiad , Vantika's story that started with a single move, now takes a thousand miles.As the latest recipient of the prestigious Arjuna Award , she continues to prove that even in a land where chess culture is scarce, a determined mind can sense a way out and carve its own path.“I felt on top of the world,” she told TimesofIndia.com -- her excitement evident after receiving the Arjuna Award from President Droupadi Murmu at Rashtrapati Bhavan almost a month ago.The award wasn’t just a personal victory but a well-crafted story that would've always remained under the stones had she never decided to prioritise chess over everything else.""Before chess, I was involved in a lot of activities, like skating, dancing, music, art, cricket, and more. I mean, I was playing all kinds of sports and engaging in these activities,"" said Vantika.The affair with chess began serendipitously during her school’s zero period. At just seven-and-a-half-years-old, she and her brother, Vishesh, stumbled into the chess room of Amity International in Noida.The game’s unique mechanics filled her with awe, and soon enough, she persuaded her mother to enrol them at Genius Chess Academy in Noida before transitioning to home coaching under Manish Unyal.One tournament led to another, and before she knew it, she was winning state, national, Asian, and World Championships. As she put it, “After my first tournament win, I never looked back.”While her training started with local coaches, she eventually sought guidance from grandmasters like Praveen Thipsay, Tejas Bakre, and Vishnu Prasanna.But the transition was not as smooth as it might look from the outskirts.""The challenge that I faced is like (one) I'm still facing. In north India, there is no culture of chess. In the south, you have academies, but here, no culture,"" she admitted.Lack of a chess culture led to existential questions.""If someone asks what you do, and you say, 'I'm a chess player ,' their response is usually, 'Okay, but what do you actually do? What are you studying?' I think it's still the same story, even after winning so many medals. People still ask, 'Chess is fine, but what do you really do?'"" she said with a chuckle.Tacking these everyday challenges, Vantina is now aiming even higher, but it is not without any support.Behind every aspiring Indian chess mind of this current generation is a parent who sacrifices everything to help their child succeed. For Vantika, that pillar of support has been her mother.Despite being a Chartered Accountant, her mother left her job to travel with her across India and the world, ensuring she never missed a tournament.“Without her, none of this would have been possible,” Vantika added, unable to put her gratitude into words.During her formative years, Vantika dedicated two to three hours daily to chess, gradually increasing her training to six to eight hours.Her rigorous routine includes solving puzzles, reading books by world champions like Bobby Fischer, Mikhail Tal, and Vishwanathan Anand, and working with top coaches.“You have to read a lot to get insights and knowledge. Chess books are like hidden treasures,” explained the 22-year-old who is part of Viswanathan Anand 's WestBridge Anand Chess Academy (WACA).During tournaments, her schedule is even more disciplined -- morning yoga and meditation, breakfast, preparation, intense matches, post-game analysis, and studying opponent strategies for the next round.When asked about different chess formats -- Classical, Rapid, Blitz, and Chess960 -- Vantika expressed, “Blitz is my favourite because of its fast-paced nature, but Chess960 is fascinating since it removes opening preparations and makes you rely entirely on skill.""Despite her monumental achievements, though, Vantika is still fighting for recognition on the global stage.Unlike many international grandmasters who receive invitations to Elite tournaments, she has to rely on Open tournaments to improve her rating.“I won two gold medals at the Olympiad, but I’m still not getting invitations to top-tier tournaments,” she remarked.Yet, she remains undeterred, focused on proving herself by competing in every possible open tournament.Her ultimate goal? To continue refining her game, work with top Indian and international Grandmasters, and keep making her mark in the world of 64 squares.READ ALSO: China No. 1 Wei Yi lauds Gukesh and Praggnanandhaa, says 'blitz games shouldn't decide classical chess titles' | Exclusive","Vantika Agrawal is a three-time gold medalist at the Chess Olympiad.

Former Australian skipper Michael Clarke has backed India captain Rohit Sharma to be the leading run-scorer in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy , which kicks off on February 19 in Karachi. India have been placed in Group A alongside Pakistan, New Zealand, and Bangladesh. The Men in Blue begin their campaign on February 20 against Bangladesh in Dubai.Rohit Sharma returned to top form during the recent three-match ODI series against England, notching up a century in the second ODI. The 37-year-old Indian captain faced significant scrutiny following a poor Test series against Australia but silenced critics with a commanding hundred.""Well, I am saying India is going to win (Champions Trophy). I am going to go with their captain, who's back in form. I am going to say Rohit Sharma — leading run scorer in the tournament,"" Clarke stated on the latest episode of Beyond23 Cricket Podcast.""It's good to see him making runs again. I think India need him for sure,"" he added.Clarke also predicted that England’s Jofra Archer would emerge as the tournament’s top wicket-taker, despite expecting England to underperform in the Champions Trophy. England are in Group B alongside Australia, South Africa, and Afghanistan.""I want to go with Jofra Archer — leading wicket-taker. I know England; I am not expecting them to do that well, but I think he's a superstar. I think Jofra is going to be really hard to play. So, I am going to have him as my leading wicket-taker,"" Clarke mentioned.The 2015 World Cup-winning captain further picked Australian opener Travis Head as the Player of the Tournament. While he expects Australia to reach the final, he does not see them lifting the trophy.""I am going to go with Travis Head (for Player of the Tournament). Travis Head has been in terrific form. His IPL form was phenomenal. Australian Test summer form was phenomenal. He has had a bit of a break in Sri Lanka. He is ready to go again. So, I am going to say Travis Head Player of the Tournament even though I think Australia might lose the final,"" Clarke concluded.","Michael Clarke has backed India captain Rohit Sharma to be the leading run- scorer in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy.

Does India's middle order wear an uncertain look heading into the Champions Trophy? The dominance against England at home in the lead up to the ICC tournament notwithstanding, there appears to be some confusion regarding key middle-order slots. At the core of the debate are the decisions to play KL Rahul ahead of Rishabh Pant as the lead wicketkeeper and sending Axar Patel out to bat ahead of KL Rahul at No. 5.Selection committee chief Ajit Agarkar, while announcing the Champions Trophy squad, had claimed Pant was the first-choice wicketkeeper. As it turned out, Pant is the only player in the squad who didn't get a game in the three ODIs in the England series. Sources indicated that there had been heated debate in the selection meeting around retaining Shreyas Iyer in the team and over the second wicketkeeper's slot.Former India coach Ravi Shastri sparked off the debate when the camera panned on Pant in the dugout in the second ODI. Shastri, on air at the moment, emphatically announced that he was bewildered by the fact that a player of Pant's calibre was being kept out of the playing XI.Shastri himself would know a few things about going into a marquee tournament with an unsettled batting lineup. Devang Gandhi, a national selector during Shastri's tenure as India head coach, said, ""Gambhir must be given due credit for working with a team in transition. He has got India dominating in the ODI format, much like India were doing from 2016-2019. What the selectors and Gambhir need to be careful about is consistency in the middle order,"" Gandhi told TOI.The reference here is to India's batting collapses in the 2017 Champions Trophy final against Pakistan and in the 2019 World Cup semifinal against New Zealand.""The batting then was largely driven by the top three - Rohit, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli . What happened then was nobody else got time to settle down from No. 4 onwards. The rest of the batting wasn't sure of the role they had to play.""When the top order collapsed in those big matches, the rest of the batting looked clueless. Hopefully, it isn't the case this time. If they have identified Axar as a No. 5 batter then they must look to give him a run at that number. Axar has done well but the management has to decide if he is going to be a long-term option who can rebuild and dominate an innings till the 2027 World Cup in South Africa,"" Gandhi said.The team management has backed Axar's promotion up the order and explained the need to have a right-left batting combination in the middle overs. Former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta, who was on air with Shastri when the point was raised, highlighted that a left-handed Pant would always be a bigger threat in the middle order than Axar Patel. ""If the argument is to have a left-handed batter in the middle, then Pant fits the bill perfectly. Why wait for a left-hander to come out at No. 5? Pant could bat at No. 4 followed by Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja ,"" Dasgupta said.Dasgupta argued that Rahul batting at No. 6 serves little purpose, since he is not a natural power-hitter who can hit from the word go. ""I understand the team wants to back Rahul since he has been consistent in the absence of Pant. But he did it at No. 5, where he could still build an innings. If that's the case, then let Rahul bat at No. 4 and get Iyer at No. 6, because he has the game to finish the death overs strongly.""Rahul batting at No. 6 is not likely to help his cause,"" Dasgupta said.Iyer himself set the cat amongst pigeons when he revealed that he wasn't supposed to start in the XI in the first ODI. It was only due to Kohli's knee niggle that a vacancy opened up in the middle order. Iyer cashed in on the opportunity, logging two emphatic half-centuries and an innings of 44 which was cut short by a run out.""The idea to bench Iyer at the start of the series didn't make any sense, since Iyer has been exceptional in the 2023 ODI World Cup and India have played very few ODIs after the World Cup,"" Gandhi said.However, at the end of the series, Gambhir insisted that Iyer was always a first-choice pick and that the team management just wanted to check out Yashasvi Jaiswal at the top of the order in the first ODI. Eventually, Jaiswal became the fall guy when the selectors decided to rope in an X-factor in Varun Chakravarthy in the bowling department, which seems overloaded with five spinners now.If India can come up with a more settled plan for the middle overs, they might just be runway favourites in the Champions Trophy.",India have been dominant in the few ODIs they've played heading into the Champions Trophy.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals ' dramatic last-ball victory over Mumbai Indians in the Women's Premier League was marred by two contentious run-out decisions, sparking debate among fans and experts.Arundhati Reddy sealed a tense two-wicket win by scrambling a two off the final delivery, but the focus remained on the two third-umpire calls that left many questioning the interpretation of the rules.With 25 runs needed from 15 deliveries, Shikha Pandey attempted a risky bye after missing a shot but was sent back by non-striker Niki Prasad. A direct hit at the striker's end saw Pandey stretching to make her ground, and at the moment the LED stumps lit up, she appeared to be short.However, after a lengthy review, third umpire Gayathri Venugopalan ruled Pandey not out, basing the decision on when the bail was completely removed from the groove rather than when the lights first illuminated.A near-identical incident occurred seven balls later, with Radha Yadav attempting a quick single before being sent back. Despite a desperate dive, replays showed her bat hovering above the crease when the LED lights first flashed. Yet, by the time the bails were fully dislodged, her bat had made contact with the ground.

Australian cricket star Steve Smith has expressed confidence that spinner Matt Kuhnemann will pass all tests on his bowling action, stating he was ""surprised"" when told the left-armer had been reported.Kuhnemann is set to undergo biomechanical testing within the next 10 days after match officials raised concerns about his action during the second Test against Sri Lanka. Despite this, Smith remains optimistic about the outcome.""It's come as a bit of a surprise to me,"" Smith said. ""He has been playing for eight years in professional cricket and nothing has been said in that amount of time. I am thinking of him, at present, he has to go through the process. We're confident he will pass. He will go through that process back home, we wish him all the best.""Australian officials have been reserved about the specifics of Kuhnemann’s assessment, but it is expected to take place in Brisbane. The 28-year-old will undergo hours of testing, with markers attached to his arm and cameras monitoring whether his elbow extension stays within the ICC’s permitted 15-degree limit.Despite the report, Kuhnemann is still eligible to play domestic cricket and is set to feature for Tasmania in the Sheffield Shield. However, ICC rules prohibit him from participating in international matches until he is cleared.The decision to flag Kuhnemann’s action has left Australian players and officials puzzled, given that he has played 124 professional matches since 2017 without any prior concerns. The left-arm spinner has previously represented Australia in ODIs against Sri Lanka in 2022 and in Tests against India in 2023, before starring with 16 wickets at 17.18 in the recent Test series win in Galle.Smith revealed that he only learned of Kuhnemann being cited after Australia’s series-clinching win in Galle and did not notice anything unusual in the spinner’s action.Sri Lankan players had reportedly raised concerns about Kuhnemann’s action during the series, prompting umpires to refer him to the ICC. However, Sri Lanka's spin bowling coach, Piyal Wijetunge, defended Kuhnemann, suggesting that the doubts arose due to his distinctive wrist action rather than any illegal movement.If Kuhnemann's action is deemed illegal, he will face a tight deadline to rectify it before Australia's three-Test series against the West Indies in June and July. His availability will also be crucial for Australia's 2027 tour of India, where his left-arm spin could play a key role alongside Nathan Lyon","Matt Kuhnemann set to undergo biomechanical testing within the next 10 days.

Real Madrid maintained their top position in La Liga despite a 1-1 stalemate at Osasuna on Saturday, a match marked by Jude Bellingham's dismissal, whilst Atletico Madrid also drew 1-1 against Celta Vigo.The league leaders scored first through Kylian Mbappe , but proceedings took a turn when Bellingham received a red card for dissent near the conclusion of the first period.Osasuna equalised via Ante Budimir's penalty conversion at the 58-minute mark, as the defending champions extended their winless league run to three matches.Despite playing with reduced numbers after Pablo Barrios' early dismissal in the seventh minute, Atletico Madrid stayed within a point of Los Blancos, whilst Barcelona could potentially match Real Madrid's points tally should they triumph over Rayo Vallecano on Monday.Bellingham defended his actions, stating he was merely expressing personal frustration. ""I think you can see clearly in the video, I remember the incident very well, it was an expression to myself,"" he told reporters. ""I'm not even directing myself towards the referee, but obviously there was a misunderstanding. He's believed that I've said (something insulting) to him... There was no intent to insult him, there was no insult.""Carlo Ancelotti, Real Madrid's manager, expressed satisfaction with his team's performance despite the result. ""In a footballing sense we started very well, and we finished well despite having one less player,"" said Ancelotti.The Italian tactician adjusted his lineup considering the upcoming Champions League fixture against Manchester City, resting Rodrygo whilst giving Brahim Diaz a start.Los Blancos dominated early proceedings with swift ball movement, and Mbappe soon converted Fede Valverde's cross, marking his seventh goal in five La Liga appearances.The match shifted when Bellingham received his red card at 39 minutes after an exchange with referee Jose Munuera Montero.Ancelotti defended his player: ""I think with Bellingham's red card (the referee) didn't understand the English well... I don't think it's something offensive. I think the red card came out because the referee was nervous... Bellingham did nothing today to have been sent off, absolutely nothing.""After previous complaints about Spanish officiating, Madrid's frustrations grew in the second half. Osasuna equalised through Budimir's penalty after Camavinga fouled him, bringing the striker's season tally to 13 goals.Mbappe had a final opportunity in stoppage time, but goalkeeper Sergio Herrera made a crucial save.Regarding Atletico's match, Diego Simeone praised his team's resilience: ""The team had gladiators again, playing 90 minutes with one fewer player is very tough,"" whilst acknowledging Barrios' dismissal as correct.Koke reflected on the challenge: ""When we were left with 10 men it's very difficult... the team tried everything. We defended well, we suffered when we had to. Obviously we're still in the fight for the title.""In another fixture, Valencia secured a 1-1 draw at Villarreal in their relegation battle.","Real Madrid held to 1-1 draw by Osasuna in La Liga.

Bagan show their might to Blasters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/bagan-show-their-might-to-blasters/articleshow/118293743.cms,"KOCHI: On Saturday evening, Mohun Bagan Super Giant demonstrated to Kerala Blasters why they are on top of the ISL table. They also proved that superior ball possession and attacking prowess cannot compensate for defensive frailties.Despite Blasters controlling 67% of the possession, Bagan secured a commanding 3-0 victory over the home side at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Kochi, with Jamie MacLaren netting twice (28, 40) and Alberto Rodriguez (66) completing the tally for the visitors.The first 25 minutes of the game were all about Blasters. They mounted one attack after another on the Bagan goal but failed to convert any of their chances into goals. However, the Kolkata giants weathered the storm and scored against the run of play in the 28th minute. Once they found an opening, Bagan knew how to kill the game and did just that.The home side's best chance in the first half came in the 20th minute, but Jesus Jimenez squandered it. A poor backpass inside the box from Bagan's Lalengmawia Ralte was collected by Jimenez. Despite successfully beating the offside trap, the forward's shot sailed high over the crossbar.The architect of Bagan's first goal was Liston Colaco. With a clever move, he outmanoeuvred Luna and delivered the ball from the left to MacLaren inside the box. MacLaren's excellent first touch followed by a powerful left-footed strike thudded into Blasters' net.Bagan nearly doubled their advantage five minutes later as Colaco's curling attempt from the left narrowly missed the target.MacLaren made it 2-0 four minutes before half-time. The sequence began with Vishal Keith's long pass to MacLaren, who cleverly backheeled to Jason Cummings. The UK striker then chipped the ball towards MacLaren, who sprinted past the Blasters' defence and cleverly lobbed it over the advancing Sachin Suresh into the goal. Although MacLaren put the ball in the Blasters' net one more time during first-half stoppage time, the goal was disallowed for offside.Bagan extended the lead in the 66th minute through defender Alberto Rodriguez Martin's strike. Once again, the Blasters defence failed to clear their lines during a set piece. After the initial shot was blocked by the two-man wall, the ball fell before Rodriguez, whose powerful left-footer was enough to beat a diving Sachin Suresh.The defeat has hit Blasters' playoff qualification hopes. They are eighth in the points table with 24 points from 20 matches and trail sixth-placed Mumbai City by seven points. Bagan, having already secured their playoff spot, strengthened their position at the summit with 49 points from 21 matches.","Mohun Bagan beat Kerala Blasters 3-0 at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Kochi.

SA20 showcasing perfect balance between bat and ball: Vernon Philander

NEW DELHI: Dinesh Karthik came in as Jos Buttler's replacement in the Paarl Royals squad ahead of the third season of the SA20 - South Africa's premier T20 competition. On January 11, he made his debut against two-time defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape in a milestone moment. 'DK', as he is commonly and popularly known, became the first Indian to feature in the SA20.Unlike the female players, Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has a strict rule on Indian players plying their trade in foreign T20 leagues. In order to retain exclusivity for the Indian Premier League (IPL), male players cannot play in T20 leagues abroad. The exception, however, is made when the player announces retirement from international cricket and the IPL.Karthik fit that bill after playing his last for Royal Challengers Bengaluru in IPL 2024. After 257 IPL matches in which he scored 4842 runs, DK decided to say goodbye for good. He decided to make a U-turn because of the competition and the lure of playing for the Royals.Now with the season wrapped up, where Paarl Royals bowed out after Qualifier 2, Karthik admits BCCI's stiff policy is for the betterment of Indian cricket and its players with enough happening at state levels as well to aid youngsters.""I'm a big believer that the IPL should be the crown jewel for BCCI. And it is, at the moment, the crown jewel in world cricket. And for that to maintain its status quo as No. 1, I believe that Indian cricketers shouldn't be allowed unless they're retired,"" he said in a conversation organised by SA20.""Because they can take the call if they feel they're done with the IPL and then move on to play other leagues. I completely stand with the BCCI on that front. I agree you can always argue saying 'Can youngsters be given an opportunity?' But I think there is enough in India in terms of competition and ways of being financially secure. And if you're good enough, IPL is a great platform. They have domestic cricket and all the state franchise leagues as well.""So I think there's a lot of cricket that's played in India. And I think cricketers from India should be allowed to play once they retire. And I believe that is the right way to go. And I think SA20, or any other league for that matter, will be more than happy to work with and to have a couple of the players who have retired from BCCI and from playing for India,"" he added.Karthik played 11 matches in the season for Paarl Royals and scored 130 runs at an average of 21.67 and strike rate of 121.50 in a season that saw scarcity of runs under tough pitches. Enough that Royals set a record of bowling their entire 20 overs against Pretoria Capitals with spinners - an aspect that brought out a chuckle from DK who compared the conditions at Boland Park to Tamil Nadu.He might not have set the scoring charts ablaze but did have a jolly time in South Africa with family in tow - especially at the 10,000 capacity Boland Park.""IPL (and SA20) had one thing in common - the fact that there were full houses for all games that I played. So Paarl is well supported, but you have to understand the numbers are very different. South Africa had packed houses, almost all the games that we played, which was very encouraging,"" he said.""Standard of cricket is very good. Obviously, with IPL, the challenges are very different. The quality in terms of how it is played over two months is very, very different to SA20.""Paarl Royals (and eventual champions MI Cape Town) went unbeaten in the league stage with five wins in five played. While MICT went all the way, Royals stumbled against the Sunrisers Eastern Cape. Yet, it was a memorable debut season for Karthik who shared the dressing room with England's Joe Root.""Playing with Joe Root was one of the highlights, I believe, for me personally, playing this tournament. I've never interacted much with him. Always seen him - said a hello, but to rub shoulders with him, be with him in the same dressing room, what a terrific personality. He's a legend of the game. Easily will go down as one of the greatest batters to have ever played this sport.""But the attitude that he brings, it's just very warm, welcoming, helps the youngsters so much. And always wants to have fun and a laugh. And wants the team to have a great time. Like we had this pushups contest after a match. And it was all started by him. It's just the energy that he brings, the genuinity that he brings towards the sport. It was wonderful playing with him. It was one of the best experiences, actually, playing with such a legend who has no hang-ups about himself. Very relaxed, very humble. It was a lot of fun,"" stated Karthik who acknowledged he would be keen on being part of the SA20 again in the future.",Dinesh Karthik is the first Indian to feature in South Africa's premier T20 competition.

Tottenham Hotspur secured a narrow 1-0 victory against Manchester United on Sunday, dealing another disappointing result to Red Devils' manager Ruben Amorim. A solitary goal from James Maddison in the 13th minute propelled Spurs above United to 12th position, marking their third triumph over United this season.The win provided relief for Tottenham's manager Ange Postecoglou, who had faced criticism following recent eliminations from domestic cup competitions and poor league performance. United slipped to 15th position, though maintaining a comfortable 12-point gap from the relegation zone.""The place in the table is my worry, I am not worried about me,"" said Amorim, who has managed just four victories in 14 Premier League matches since his November appointment. ""I hate to lose. That feeling is the worst. The rest I am not thinking about. I understand my situation, my job, I am confident in my work and I just want to win games.""Tottenham's first home league victory since November occurred amidst supporter unrest. Fans expressed their dissatisfaction towards ENIC and chairman Daniel Levy through protests before and after the match. A prominent banner stated ""24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy - Time for change"" as supporters demanded Levy's departure.Postecoglou's squad received a boost with several key players returning from injury. Goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario made his first appearance since November, whilst Maddison returned to the starting eleven. Destiny Udogie, Brennan Johnson and Wilson Odobert were available as substitutes.""They are quality players. We've had it pretty tough the last two-and-a-half months,"" said Postecoglou. ""It was important for us to win and gain some traction. I certainly feel there is still a massive opportunity for us in this back half of the season and hopefully today is the start of that.""United faced their own injury challenges, with Amad Diallo joining Lisandro Martinez as long-term absentees and Kobbie Mainoo sidelined for a month. Amorim's bench included eight teenagers, whilst Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee started upfront.The match saw several chances for both sides. Vicario denied attempts from Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho, whilst Maddison capitalised on Andre Onana's parry to score.

Premier League: Luis Diaz breaks drought as Liverpool extend lead to seven points,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/premier-league-luis-diaz-breaks-drought-as-liverpool-extend-lead-to-seven-points/articleshow/118307650.cms,"(Photo credit: Liverpool)

NEW DELHI: Liverpool on Sunday secured a 2-1 victory against Wolves at Anfield, extending their lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points.Luis Diaz ended his goal drought with his first goal in 2025, while Mohamed Salah continued his impressive form as Liverpool bounced back from a disappointing week.The Colombian forward scored his 13th goal of the season after going 10 games without finding the net.Salah's penalty conversion before halftime marked his 28th goal across all competitions this season.Wolves' Matheus Cunha scored in the second half, but Liverpool managed to hold on despite showing signs of fatigue in a tense finish.Liverpool's previous two matches resulted in an FA Cup fourth round defeat to Plymouth and a 2-2 draw with Everton.Arsenal's recent 2-0 victory at Leicester had put additional pressure on Liverpool's title pursuit.Liverpool's response moved them closer to potentially securing their 20th English title, which would equal the existing record.With upcoming matches against Aston Villa, Manchester City, and Newcastle in the next 10 days, Liverpool could strengthen their position in the title race.Manager Arne Slot was present despite facing charges for confronting referee Michael Oliver after the Merseyside derby.The incident stemmed from Slot's disagreement over James Tarkowski's stoppage-time equalizer, which he believed should have been disallowed due to a possible foul by Beto on Ibrahima Konate.Slot had urged Liverpool to use their 'anger' from the painful end to the Everton game as fuel to get back on track against Wolves.Diaz opened the scoring in the 15th minute with his first league goal at Anfield since September.The goal came after Diaz found Salah, whose return pass deflected off Toti Gomes. Diaz managed to chest the ball past Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa.Dominik Szoboszlai nearly added to Liverpool's lead with a low shot that went wide.Jose Sa was forced to save Diogo Jota's attempt following Andy Robertson's cross.Liverpool extended their lead in the 37th minute through Salah's penalty, despite Wolves' protests about a possible push by Diaz on Emmanuel Agbadou.Salah's recent form has been exceptional, with seven goals in his last six appearances.Wolves' new signing Marshall Munetsi missed a clear opportunity early in the second half, with Alisson Becker making a crucial save.A penalty decision for Liverpool was overturned by VAR after replays showed Jota had dived following Agbadou's challenge.Cunha took advantage of Liverpool's declining momentum, scoring with a curling shot past Ryan Gravenberch in the 67th minute.Liverpool persevered through a challenging final period to claim their fourth victory in five league matches.","Liverpool beat Wolves 2-1 to extend their lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points.

Responding to Brighton's impressive 3-0 victory at the Amex Stadium on Friday, Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca acknowledged it as the ""worst performance"" under his leadership, with Japanese talent Kaoru Mitoma delivering a spectacular Premier League goal.The lacklustre Chelsea side failed to register any shots on target, marking their second loss within a week at the venue.Fresh from scoring the decisive goal in Brighton's 2-1 FA Cup triumph over Chelsea the previous weekend, Mitoma continued to shine. His remarkable first-half display of skill preceded Gambian winger Yankuba Minteh's double strike.Having arrived from Leicester, Maresca's inaugural season included recent statements about Chelsea's rightful place in the Champions League , aligning with the club's two-year qualification objective.The recent defeat, their third in four matches across all competitions, has dampened their top-four aspirations.""I constantly feel pressure, but today's performance stands out as the poorest since my arrival,"" Maresca stated. ""This result brings complete frustration. We deeply regret disappointing our travelling supporters.""The manager faces the crucial task of addressing Chelsea's defensive vulnerabilities if the fourth-placed team, currently leading Manchester City and Newcastle by two points, aims to achieve their seasonal objectives.Maresca elaborated: ""In our current position, with an opportunity to extend our lead over pursuing teams, tonight's performance highlights numerous areas requiring improvement. However, we maintain fourth position and remain competitive for a strong finish.""Brighton, who suffered a 7-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest in their last league encounter and had secured only two victories in their previous twelve top-flight matches, have regained momentum with consecutive wins against Chelsea.Cole Palmer's early-season prowess, yielding six goals in seven initial league appearances followed by eight more (including two penalties) in seventeen subsequent matches, has notably diminished.Chelsea's trajectory has shifted from potential title challengers to top-four contenders as Palmer's form cooled. His struggles continued with wayward attempts before Noni Madueke's injury-enforced departure compounded Chelsea's fitness concerns.Brighton's opening goal showcased Mitoma's brilliance, expertly controlling Bart Verbruggen's goal-kick before outmanoeuvring Trevoh Chalobah and finishing precisely.Despite Enzo Fernandez's disallowed header due to a clear push, Brighton extended their lead through Minteh, capitalising on Chelsea's defensive errors. The third goal arrived from Minteh's skilled finish following Danny Welbeck's contribution, despite Chelsea's protests about a possible foul on Levi Colwill.","Brighton beat Chelsea 3-0 at the Amex Stadium on Friday night.

There is no doubt about the motivation that we have, you saw it last week (Chennaiyin notched up a 3-0 ISL victory over East Bengal FC in Kolkata).“We want to show that we have good players and a good team. We have to fight till our last breath. There is a Super Cup to be played, so you want to get yourself in the best condition (leading into it),” said Coyle ahead of the ISL clash against Punjab FC, scheduled on Saturday at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here.Coyle stressed that the team is determined to make a “strong finish” to the season. “We have three home games (in the ISL), we want to take one at a time. We want to win the home games; to do that, we have to be at our best. That is what we need to focus on. We have to get the boys back fit and healthy.

We have to be more consistent,” added the Scotsman.Must-win game for Punjab: Punjab, sitting ninth on the ISL table with 24 points off 19 games, will need a win against CFC to improve their playoff chances.

The Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) has received its third FIFA ban since 2017, which has jeopardized its men's national team's participation in the 2027 Asian Cup qualifying campaign.On January 25, the PFF Congress had dismissed constitutional amendments proposed jointly by FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), which had led to the latest ban, after similar sanctions in 2017 for five months and in 2021 for 14 months.In 2017 and 2021, FIFA imposed bans on Pakistan following external interference in PFF operations. FIFA established a Normalization Committee in 2019 to oversee Pakistan football and conduct PFF elections. The committee continues to function as elections remain pending.""It's not surprising anymore as there are power struggles in Pakistan football with people promoting themselves and not caring about the game,"" Pakistan player Navid Rahman told The Associated Press. ""Also FIFA and the AFC should take some of the blame as this is a recurring issue which should have been sorted out before.""The sport has faced significant challenges domestically, with the absence of a national league since 2019.""As soon as there is a little traction that develops in Pakistan football, then something happens,"" Rahman said.

NEW DELHI: World No. 1 Jannik Sinner has accepted a three-month suspension in a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) after testing positive for Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid.The suspension, which runs from February 9 to May 4, means the 23-year-old Italian will miss several key tournaments, including Indian Wells , Miami, Monte Carlo, and the Madrid Open.However, he is expected to return in time for the Italian Open in Rome (May 7–18), just weeks before the French Open (May 25–June 8).The case stems from two positive doping tests last March. The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) initially cleared Sinner, accepting his explanation that the substance entered his system through accidental contamination -- trace amounts were transferred from a trainer who had applied the substance to a cut on his finger.WADA, however, appealed the ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, seeking at least a one-year ban. The two sides reached a settlement, reducing the suspension to three months.Sinner’s absence is a significant blow to the ATP Tour , given his dominance in recent months.After winning his Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January, he had been in top form and was seen as a major contender for upcoming clay-court events. Thanks to his triumph in Melbourne, he is now eligible to compete in the next Grand Slam.His absence from Indian Wells and Miami -- two prestigious Masters 1000 tournaments -- will impact the battle for the ATP No. 1 ranking.The Italian will now focus on preparing for his comeback at home in Rome, where he will aim to regain momentum ahead of Roland Garros .","World No. 1 Jannik Sinner has accepted a three-month suspension.

World number one tennis player Jannik Sinner has reached an agreement with the World Anti-Doping Agency, accepting a three-month suspension.The case originated when WADA challenged the International Tennis Integrity Agency's previous ruling from last year. The ITIA had decided not to suspend Sinner for what they determined was an unintentional contamination.The tennis star's defence was accepted when he explained that traces of Clostebol , a banned anabolic steroid, appeared in his March doping test due to a massage from a trainer who had used the substance after cutting his finger.The 23-year-old Italian, who clinched the Australian Open title in January, will be eligible to compete in the upcoming Grand Slam, with the French Open set to begin on May 25.""This case had been hanging over me now for nearly a year and the process still had a long time to run with a decision maybe only at the end of the year,"" Sinner said in a statement.""I have always accepted that I am responsible for my team and realize WADA's strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love. On that basis I have accepted WADA's offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a 3-month sanction.""Initially, WADA had appealed the ITIA's ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland, seeking a minimum one-year ban for Sinner.His suspension is effective from February 9 to May 4, allowing him to make a potential return at his home tournament, the Italian Open in Rome, starting May 7.Sinner's lawyer, Jamie Singer of Onside Law, commented: ""I am delighted that Jannik can finally put this harrowing experience behind him. WADA has confirmed the facts determined by the Independent Tribunal. It is clear that Jannik had no intent, no knowledge, and gained no competitive advantage.

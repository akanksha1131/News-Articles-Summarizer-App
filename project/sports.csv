India Asia Cup squad press conference: What Ajit Agarkar, Surya said on shocking calls

Poll Do you believe Shubman Gill will become a successful captain for India? Yes, definitely No, not likely

NEW DELHI: Renowned astrologer Greenstone Lobo has made bold predictions about Shubman Gill ’s future as a player and captain, stating that while the young opener has a “phenomenal horoscope” and will emerge as a run-machine for India, his leadership might not immediately bring major ICC trophies.Speaking in an exclusive video with TimesofIndia.com, Lobo explained:“Shubman Gill is a reigning superstar of Indian cricket. So how are his stars placed in the next 4 to 5 years? How is he going to fare as a player, as a captain for India, for his franchise is what I am going to talk about in this video. So talking about Shubman Gill, he has a phenomenal horoscope.”Lobo clarified that Gill’s exact year of birth — 1997 or 1999 — is uncertain, but regardless, his astrological chart is extremely powerful.“He could be either born in 1997 or in 1999. So sometimes whatever you see on the internet may not be true. So he has got a phenomenal chart irrespective of whichever date he is born in. And he has got all the asteroids very powerful. He has got a Pluto in grey lizard. See Pluto in grey lizard avatar belongs to a person who will overcome the biggest of challenges and become victorious.”Lobo cited Gill’s leadership in recent series wins as an early example of this.“And we have already seen the glimpse of what exactly that means. So 2-1 and series 1 was online and inspired leadership. Of course there were so many other factors but leadership of Shubman definitely played a role and he went on to make it 2-0. That was an awesome thing, right? So now the question is, did the selectors do the right thing by making him a captain? Yes, he has made it absolutely clear that yes it was the right thing. ”However, Lobo was cautious about Gill’s suitability as ODI captain in the near term.“Now the question is, will the Indian selectors, will they go on and make Shubman Gill the captain of even the ODI team? And of course he is already a designated vice captain. But can he become the captain? And also what will happen if he becomes the captain of the T20 team? It’s a big question that I am going to answer now.”He explained that historically, captains with strong planetary alignment in the 7th house — such as MS Dhoni and Rohit Sharma — succeeded in winning trophies.“See, to beat enemies in sports and that too at the highest level, then you need some extraordinary horoscope. So for example if you are looking at somebody like MS Dhoni or it can be Rohit Sharma, both of them had the strongest planet in their chart used to be in the 7th house. 7th house means beating enemies. Now the question is, does Shubman Gill have that? Okay, we don’t know his exact birth details… But he has already become a captain and he is a great player. ”Lobo believes Gill’s peak success as captain could come only after 2031.“The point is, at this point of time, whatever planetary positions are, they are largely favouring people who would be in the mid 90s. Shubman Gill is born in the late 90s… Captains born during these times will only win the major trophies. So if he becomes the ODI captain, I would say that’s not a good idea. That wouldn’t be very good for India. I am not talking about long term… Probably the 2031 World Cup would be a better time for Shubman Gill to win a major trophy. ”He even issued a plea to the selectors.“I mean, please. Okay, all the selectors, if anybody is listening. Ajit Agarkar , Gautam Gambir, please, please, please. You are only killing the chances of India to win the World Cup. It is going to be something massive… And we want the right captain. And the right captain would be… Anyone born between 93 to 94. Even 92 is also okay. Some good player, born during that time, should be made the ODI captain.”While hesitant about Gill captaining ODIs or T20Is immediately, Lobo was firm that the young star’s batting would flourish.“Because, you know, Shubman has got a phenomenal horoscope. He is going to play well. He is going to keep on playing. He is going to be rocking and he is going to do all this. He is going to pile on the runs. And what will happen is, it will put a lot of pressure on the selectors and maybe he may become the captain… He is going to be a run machine. You wouldn’t miss Virat Kohli much because this guy is there.”Lobo predicted Gill’s combination with head coach Gautam Gambhir would be particularly effective in bilateral series.“You can actually see Shubman will keep piling runs. See, on a one-on-one combat, okay, let’s say that bilateral series, you know, he is going to Australia, he is going to Siena countries. It may be difficult, but then he may create real good records there. So, his combination with Gautam Kampir is going to work wonders, especially in one-on-one battles.”However, he warned that winning ICC trophies would be a tougher task for Gill, at least in the short term.“But if you are talking about winning an ICC trophy, the ICC trophy is always a multi-team tournament, where he is going to have challenges. Probably, he can win an IPL, okay, but winning a World Cup or winning some huge ICC trophy at the highest level, something like a WTC, that’s going to be very, very difficult for Shubman. At least, not immediately. Long run, yes. After four years, yes. Immediately, the next two, three ICC trophies, okay, I just hope that selectors make the right decisions. ”","Renowned astrologer Greenstone Lobo has made bold predictions about Shubman Gill’s future as a player and captain.

India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking points

NEW DELHI: Former India opener Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise at Shreyas Iyer ’s exclusion from the reserve players list for the upcoming Asia Cup , pointing out that it doesn’t send the right message regarding his T20I future.Iyer, who piled up 604 runs at a strike rate of 175 in IPL 2025 while leading Punjab Kings to the runners-up spot, had shown marked improvement against the short ball and dominated spinners throughout the tournament. Yet, he found no place in either the 15-member squad for the Asia Cup or the five-man reserves list.The omission had earlier baffled former India assistant coach Abhishek Nayar, and now Chopra has voiced similar concerns. ""Shreyas' name is not even there in the five reserves, and that is surprising. It's understandable that you couldn't have him in the 15 as you can't play him in the XI, and you wanted lower-order batters as backup, where Shivam Dube is there, and Rinku Singh will be given another chance, which is absolutely par for the course.""However, a place could have been created in the reserve players at least, where you have kept Dhruv Jurel, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Prasidh Krishna. Shreyas’ name could have been there, but you haven't kept it there either, and that doesn't send a great signal. The clarity in front of Shreyas' name is completely not there,"" Chopra said on his YouTube channel on Wednesday.At the same time, Chopra believes Iyer’s international future is far from over and that he still has a pathway to the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup if he maintains strong performances in ODIs.For now, Iyer’s immediate focus will be on representing West Zone in the Duleep Trophy, which marks the start of the 2025/26 domestic season.""Shreyas Iyer not being there is a big story. What more will Shreyas Iyer have to do? What more can you do than what you have already done? You had a 600-plus run IPL season, took the team to the final, scored runs in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, played Ranji, and won the Champions Trophy. That's all you can do as a human being.""This is the Asia Cup team. Don't attach the World Cup with it because there are 15 T20Is after this. The world changes in 15 T20Is. If he keeps scoring runs in ODIs, sooner or later, Shreyas Iyer will be part of the team. I have a strong feeling that Shreyas Iyer will be a part of India's T20 World Cup team,"" he added.",Former India opener Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise at Shreyas Iyer ’s exclusion from the reserve players list for the upcoming Asia Cup.

Legendary India cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has predicted that Shubman Gill might end up leading the team in T20Is as well, after the 25-year-old was elevated as the team’s vice-captain for the Asia Cup.""Not surprising at all. He (Shubman Gill) scored over 750 runs just a couple of weeks ago,"" Gavaskar told India Today.""You cannot exclude a player in that kind of form. Also, he has done really well in the IPL, which concluded just before the tour to England.""It's a very good inclusion. Giving him the vice-captaincy is also a way of telling him that in the future, he could be leading the T20 side. I think it’s a very, very good selection,"" he added.""He was very impressive in England. To score 750-plus runs while leading the side for the first time shows how well he handled pressure.""This vice-captaincy is a clear sign that he is going to be the captain of the Indian team as well. It's always good to have him take responsibility just a little bit earlier,” Gavaskar said.Gavaskar also refused to comment on Yashasvi Jaiswal 's omission from the squad.""You can only pick XI in the match and you can only pick 15 in the squad. Somebody has to miss out; that's just how it is in Indian cricket,"" he said.""No point in discussing whether A or B or C should've been there. This is now our team. We can all have our opinions before the selection committee picks the team, but once the team is picked, we should back it fully.""We shouldn't be saying A should've been there or B should've been there.

India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking points

NEW DELHI: The announcement of India’s Asia Cup squad on Tuesday has ignited intense debate, with Ajit Agarkar and his panel facing scrutiny over the omission of proven performers like Shreyas Iyer, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna. One of the most polarising decisions has been the inclusion of Kolkata Knight Riders pacer Harshit Rana.Former India opener Aakash Chopra has questioned the logic behind Rana’s selection, arguing that his record does not justify a place in the 15-member squad.“Harshit Rana’s case is very interesting. His case needs to be discussed because he came as a concussion replacement for Shivam Dube once, picked up three wickets as well, and became the Player of the Match, which was brilliant, but what about before and after that?” Chopra asked on his YouTube channel.Rana’s IPL 2025 season was underwhelming, with 15 wickets at an economy rate of 10.18. Beyond that single standout international performance against England, Chopra felt the numbers painted a less convincing picture.“The last IPL was extremely ordinary. His performances have not been very good. His numbers are not flattering. It doesn’t seem like his numbers are strong enough to deserve a place in the side,” he said.Chopra also downplayed Rana’s chances of featuring prominently in the tournament. “The truth is also that he won’t get to play all matches. In fact, he might get to play even one match when Bumrah isn’t available. If he isn’t getting a chance to play, you say that whoever is sitting out doesn’t make a difference.”The former batter argued that Krishna, who won the IPL 2025 Purple Cap, and Siraj, with his recent form in England, were more deserving candidates. “You will find that Prasidh Krishna should have got a chance, or you could have thought about rewarding Mohammed Siraj, but the team has once again gone towards Harshit,” he concluded.",Aakash Chopra questions inclusion of Harshit Rana in India's Asia Cup squad.

Former Indian cricketer Mohammed Kaif has welcomed Jasprit Bumrah 's return to T20I cricket following his recent performance in England. Kaif defended Bumrah against critics who questioned his fitness during the fourth Manchester Test.Bumrah is set to return to T20I cricket after spending over a year focusing on Test cricket, including tours to Australia and England. He claimed 32 wickets in Australia and took 14 wickets with two five-wicket hauls in England. However, his struggles with the new ball and fitness concerns in Manchester raised questions about his workload and Asia Cup participation.Kaif addressed critics who linked India's Test losses in England to Bumrah's presence in the team.""Open your mouth carefully because you mentioned that whatever matches we played in England, we lost when he played. You better look at how many matches he has played and India won them, go and find out that as well, regardless of the format. When he plays, how many times does he give match-winning performances? Go and find that stat as well. Bumrah is a promising diamond of India. You do not report him. There are no stains on him,"" Kaif said.Kaif explained his previous prediction about Bumrah's limited Test cricket involvement due to injury concerns, adding, ""I already said that Bumrah might not be seen playing long in Tests, but in white-ball cricket, if India comes in the Asia Cup final, then he might play seven games. He will bowl 28 overs (four overs per match), and I am speaking about a two or three-week-long tournament. There is no problem in bowling 28 overs; he will get time to recover. You can rest him in one odd match against Oman or weaker teams. After workload management and a break, he will be used. I think he would not face any issues in bowling four overs. You need Bumrah in T20 because he can change the course of the game with his bowling.""Kaif expressed disappointment over Mohammed Siraj 's exclusion from the team. Siraj was the leading wicket-taker during the England tour with 23 wickets in five matches.""There is no Mohammed Siraj as well, and he will be missed because of the form he was in, the way he bowled in England, bowled longer spells in each game. By bowling that much, you have the bowling form. He plays IPL and picked up wickets as well. If you see, he is bowling exceedingly well in the first 10-12 matches. So, I am surprised he was not in the 20-member side,"" he added.""I am disappointed because he finished the series 2-2 on his own. We know how well he bowled, and when you have the form, you want to back that bowler, and that is why I am disappointed not to see him in the Asia Cup. He is an equally brilliant bowler even in white-ball cricket.""Siraj's recent performance includes taking 16 wickets in 15 matches for Gujarat Titans during IPL 2025, with best figures of 4/17. In T20Is for India, he has claimed 14 wickets in 16 matches, with his last appearance against Sri Lanka in July last year.India's Asia Cup campaign begins against UAE on September 10, followed by a match against Pakistan on September 14 in Dubai. Their final group stage match against Oman is scheduled for September 19 in Abu Dhabi.The tournament's Super 4 stage will include the top two teams from each group. If India tops Group A, all their Super 4 matches will be in Dubai. A second-place finish would mean one match in Abu Dhabi and two in Dubai.

Shubman Gill not fit to lead in all three formats | Greenstone Lobo predicts

NEW DELHI: Former India batter Mohammad Kaif has weighed in on the debate over Rohit Sharma ’s eventual successor in ODIs, firmly backing Shubman Gill to take over once the veteran opener calls time on his 50-over career.Kaif believes that the 2027 ODI World Cup will mark Rohit’s final appearance in the format, following his earlier exits from T20Is and Test cricket.“In the last three years, Gill has scored 2,000 runs. He is the future captain. He is the Test captain, and in T20Is, he is the vice-captain. Rohit is the ODI captain. He is almost 38 and I believe will retire after the 2027 ODI World Cup. When he steps away, Gill will become the captain,” Kaif said on his YouTube channel.Gill’s steady rise in the leadership ladder has indeed been remarkable. After Rohit’s final Test series in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, the young opener was handed the captaincy reins and guided India to a 2-2 draw in a challenging away series in England, amassing 754 runs with the bat. His IPL consistency and calm presence have further bolstered his credentials.Appointed as vice-captain to Suryakumar Yadav in T20Is, Gill has been recalled to the format for the upcoming Asia Cup after focusing primarily on ODIs and Tests. Chief selector Ajit Agarkar explained that Gill’s maturity and form made him an obvious choice for leadership grooming.""We obviously see some leadership qualities in him. And his form in England was what we were hoping for. He exceeded all our expectations with the kind of form that he showed with his bat, which is a great sign when there is so much pressure on you as a captain,"" Agarkar had said after announcing the Asia Cup squad.In T20Is, Gill has played 21 matches, scoring 578 runs at an average of 30.42 and a strike rate of 139.27, including a century and three fifties.",Mohammad Kaif believes Shubman Gill is the future ODI captain of India.

Poll Will South Africa win the ODI series against Australia? Yes, they have the momentum No, Australia will bounce back It's too close to call

NEW DELHI: South Africa’s convincing start to the ODI series in Australia was overshadowed by an unexpected setback, as off-spinner Prenelan Subrayen was reported for a suspect bowling action following the opening match in Cairns on Tuesday.The match officials expressed concerns about the legality of Subrayen’s action in their post-match report, prompting the ICC’s standard protocol. The 31-year-old will now undergo an Independent Assessment at an ICC-accredited testing facility, where his action will be scrutinised.The development came on what was otherwise a memorable day for Subrayen. Making his 50-over debut, he bowled a full quota of ten overs and dismissed the dangerous Travis Head, who was stumped after a failed attempt to charge down the track. Subrayen had earlier made his Test debut against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo this year, where he impressed by taking four wickets in the first innings.His report is a blow to South Africa’s balance, particularly with Kagiso Rabada already sidelined through injury for the three-match series. The Proteas, who edged out Australia in the series opener, are aiming to build on their momentum after narrowly losing the preceding T20I series 1-2.The series now moves to Mackay for the second and third ODIs on August 22 and 24. But with Subrayen’s availability under a cloud, the visitors face an untimely disruption. How the Proteas adjust their spin options could be decisive in maintaining their early advantage against the hosts.","Prenelan Subrayen was reported for a suspect bowling action following the opening match in Cairns on Tuesday.

Former England cricketer Mark Butcher has expressed concerns over Jacob Bethell's appointment as temporary captain for the upcoming T20I series against Ireland.England will play three T20Is in Dublin starting September 17. The team will be without several key players, including regular captain Harry Brook , who is being rested ahead of the Ashes series against Australia.Bethell, at 21, will become England's youngest international captain, surpassing Monty Bowden's 1889 record of captaining at age 23. The young all-rounder has played 29 international matches so far.""It's one of those ones that's quite difficult to explain, even to people like me, let alone people who have a passing interest in England's cricket teams. And therefore I don't really know what to make of it,"" Butcher said while speaking on the Wisden Cricket Weekly podcast.""He's played next to no cricket all summer. He's 21 and he's had an entire English summer where he has been fit and has played little to no cricket of any meaning whatsoever, and here he is as England's youngest ever captain,"" Butcher added.Bethell first gained attention during his Test debut in New Zealand, where he performed well at number three. He later participated in England's white-ball games and opened alongside Virat Kohli in Royal Challengers Bengaluru's first IPL victory.An injury forced Bethell to miss England's Test against Zimbabwe. He returned to the team for the fifth Test against India when captain Ben Stokes was sidelined with a shoulder injury.""Whether or not it was necessary for him to miss yet more red-ball cricket and captain the England side in Ireland, and quite frankly they've stripped out all the main players from that series anyway, with notable exceptions like Jordan Cox and Liam Livingstone - who only recently captained an England white-ball team on a tour of the West Indies,"" Butcher said.""So, was it necessary for Jacob Bethell to take on this role and play in those games in the absence of more meaningful cricket, giving what's coming up with the Ashes? I think there's a very strong argument that that is absolutely the case yes,"" he added.""It shows a bit of a lack of respect for them [Ireland] and their cricket. We're not in the business of making people feel good about themselves, but it also says, 'this is a bit of a throwaway three matches that no one is really that interested in and we'll do what we jolly well like and not be too worried about whatever the consequences might be,"" Butcher concluded.","Former England cricketer Mark Butcher has expressed concerns over Jacob Bethell's appointment as temporary captain for the upcoming T20I series against Ireland. England will play three T20Is in Dublin starting September 17. Bethell will become England's youngest international captain, surpassing Monty Bowden's 1889 record of captaining at age 23.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123412374,imgsize-41834,width-400,resizemode-4/123412374.jpg"

NEW DELHI: South Africa’s veteran spinner Keshav Maharaj has reclaimed the top spot in the latest ICC ODI bowling rankings, released on Wednesday.

The home crowd roared in approval, chanting “Fabio is the best goalkeeper in Brazil” as the veteran received a commemorative plaque.Fluminense coach Renato Gaúcho hailed his player’s longevity and professionalism: “No one plays so many matches without a level of professionalism like his. He’ll undoubtedly continue to play for a long time. It will be difficult for another player to surpass his record.”Fabio’s career has spanned nearly three decades, all within Brazil. After starting at Uniao Bandeirante in 1997, the same year Shilton retired, he went on to play 150 games for Vasco da Gama and a staggering 976 times for Cruzeiro between 2005 and 2022.

Statement by Newcastle United in response to Alexander Isak's social media post.

Newcastle striker Alexander Isak has broken his silence regarding his potential transfer to Liverpool, stating his departure would be ""in the best interests of everyone"" amid speculation of a £110 million bid from the Merseyside club. The Swedish international, who has not played in pre-season or Newcastle's opening game, expressed his frustration over broken promises and lost trust through an Instagram post on Tuesday.Liverpool's reported £110 million bid for the 25-year-old striker was rejected by Newcastle, who are demanding a British transfer record fee of up to £150 million.Isak chose not to attend the Professional Footballers' Association awards ceremony despite being named in the Premier League 2024/25 team of the year.""I've kept quiet for a long time while others have spoken. That silence has allowed people to push their own version of events, even though they know it doesn't reflect what was really said and agreed behind closed doors,"" Isak posted on Instagram. ""The reality is that promises were made and the club has known my position for a long time. To now act as if these issues are only emerging is misleading. When promises are broken and trust is lost, the relationship can't continue.That's where things are for me right now - and why change is in the best interests of everyone, not just myself.""Reports suggest Newcastle had promised Isak an improved contract but delayed due to financial sustainability rules.Newcastle responded with their own statement expressing disappointment at Isak's social media post.""We are disappointed to have been alerted to a social media post by Alexander Isak this evening,"" the club stated. ""We are clear in response that Alex remains under contract and that no commitment has ever been made by a club official that Alex can leave Newcastle United this summer. We want to keep our best players, but we also understand players have their own wishes and we listen to their views.""The club added that Isak remains part of their family and would be welcomed back when ready to rejoin his teammates.Since joining from Real Sociedad in 2022, Isak has scored 62 goals in 109 appearances for Newcastle, including the winning goal against Liverpool in the League Cup final that ended Newcastle's 70-year trophy drought.Liverpool have already invested £300 million in squad improvements this season while recouping over £200 million through sales.The Merseyside club is seeking attacking reinforcements following the departures of Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez, and the tragic death of Diogo Jota.",Newcastle striker Alexander Isak has broken his silence regarding his potential transfer to Liverpool.

NEW DELHI: Under ominous black clouds casting their spell over Delhi’s skyline, the Subroto Cup, India's oldest national school football tournament, roared to life with its 64th edition at the Ambedkar Stadium on Tuesday.Despite heavy rain in the morning hours of the day, leaving carpets soaked and the turf damp, hundreds of students and army officers in the stands cheered on to undo the damage dealt by the weather.Olympian and Arjuna Award-winning shooter Anjum Moudgil, the guest of honour for the opening ceremony, drew an exciting comparison between team sports like football and something deeply individual like shooting.While shooting remains less accessible compared to team sports like football in India, she said that individual sports are more lucrative than playing for a team.That difference, she said, lies at the heart of how recognition comes to athletes.“Yes, they are different in terms of recognition. When you win a medal, obviously you get more attention than a team,” she told TimesofIndia.com on the sidelines of the Subroto Cup.The words of the former world number one in 50m 3 position rifle come at a time when Indian shooters are riding a wave of success.Manu Bhaker set the tone at the Paris 2024 Olympics with two bronze medals, while Suruchi Singh, Arya Borse, Arjun Babuta, Sift Kaur Samra and Elavenil Valarivan all made their mark at the ISSF World Cup of late.On Tuesday, Bhaker added another bronze at the Asian Shooting Championships in Kazakhstan.On the pitch, however, the first match of the tournament lived up to its billing.Arunachal Pradesh edged past Sainik School 1-0 in the junior girls’ category, thanks to an early first-half strike.Sainik School had two goals ruled out for offside, but the contest brimmed with spirit, making it a fitting start to a competition that continues to nurture India’s next generation of footballers.With the Subroto Cup bringing in yet another generation of talented footballers, and shooters continuing to collect medals on the international stage, India’s sporting future looks brighter than ever.The junior girls’ competition runs until August 28, with the sub-junior boys and junior boys categories set to follow.

A day after crashing out of the Durand Cup, the Indian Super League champions have decided to put their foot down in releasing their players for the ongoing national camp in Bengaluru, citing the Jose Molina-managed team's own preparation of the AFC Champions League Two and dealing a blow to new India coach Khalid Jamil's preparations for the Central Asian Football Association Nations Cup.Of the 35-odd players picked by Jamil for the preparatory camp, Mohun Bagan have seven, the most from a single team.

EUPEN, Belgium - Lawyers for former France international Lassana Diarra said Monday he is claiming 65 million euros ($76 million) from FIFA and the Belgian soccer federation after a landmark legal win about transfer rules.Diarra's decade-long challenge to FIFA after a breakdown in relations with his former club Lokomotiv Moscow led to a ruling at the European Union's top court last October that some aspects of soccer's transfer rules do not comply with the 27-nation bloc's labor and competition laws.Lawyers for the 40-year-old former Chelsea, Arsenal and Real Madrid midfielder cited ""unsuccessful settlement negotiations with FIFA"" for the financial claim for damages throughout his career.""Lassana Diarra is claiming 65 million gross (35 million net) in compensation from FIFA and the Belgian Football Association,"" his legal firm Dupont Hissel said in a statement.FIFA was approached for comment about the latest high-stakes legal challenge to its authority.Diarra's case, which is back in court in Belgium, is supported by the global players' union FIFPRO, its European division and their national member union in France.The legal case started in the home country of Charleroi, the Belgian club that wanted to sign Diarra after his contract in Moscow was terminated.FIFA transfer rules at the time made the player and the potential signing club liable for paying the former club when a contract was ruled to have been broken without ""just cause."" The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld FIFA's ruling in favor of Lokomotiv.The case was sent to the European court which said the FIFA rules ""hinder the free movement of players and competition between clubs.""Diarra's dispute with Lokomotiv and FIFA forced him to miss the 2014-15 season. He then signed for Marseille and ended his career at Paris Saint-Germain six years ago.""I am doing this for myself,"" Diarra said in a statement Monday published by his lawyers. ""And if I have been able to hold out against the FIFA steamroller, it is because I had a good career.""""But I have also done it for all the up and coming, lesser known players who do not have the financial and psychological means to challenge FIFA before real judges,"" he said.Diarra's lawyers also are working on a class action suit filed this month against FIFA and some national soccer federations in Europe which claims could benefit 100,000 players over more than two decades.","Former France international Lassana Diarra is claiming 65 million euros ($76 million) from FIFA and the Belgian soccer federation.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

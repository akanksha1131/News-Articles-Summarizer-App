'They outplayed us tonight': Ryan Rickelton admits as MI face Eliminator test

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians' hopes of securing a top-two finish in the IPL 2025 were dashed on Monday after a 7-wicket loss to Punjab Kings in their final league game at Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur. Among the biggest concerns for the five-time champions this season has been the underwhelming form of senior opener and India's ODI captain, Rohit Sharma.In a high-stakes match that could have sealed a Qualifier 1 spot, Rohit scored a sluggish 24 off 21 balls, striking at just 114.29. While he and Ryan Rickelton stitched a 45-run opening stand in 5 overs, the veteran's innings lacked the aggression or authority expected from a senior player of his calibre. The team eventually fell short, managing only a below-par total that Punjab chased with ease.Rohit's overall numbers in IPL 2025 have been modest at best — 329 runs from 13 games at an average of 27.42, including three half-centuries. Crucially, 199 of those runs came in just three innings during MI's six-match winning streak, where he struck scores of 76* (vs CSK), 70 (vs SRH), and 53 (vs RR).Outside of those knocks, he has contributed only 130 runs in 10 innings, with scores like 0, 8, 13, 17, 18, 26, 12, 5 and 7 hurting MI's top-order stability.MI started their campaign poorly, losing four of their first five games. Rohit's lack of impact at the top was a major factor in those early stumbles. While Suryakumar Yadav's record-breaking season — 640 runs in 14 games — was pivotal in MI's resurgence, the inconsistency from their senior opener remains a lingering issue.As MI now gear up for the Eliminator on May 30, they will need more than just Surya's brilliance. Rohit's form could prove decisive in the knockout stages. If he doesn't fire soon, MI's dreams of a sixth title might remain just that — dreams.","MI's hopes of securing a top-two finish in the IPL 2025 were dashed on Monday after a 7-wicket loss to Punjab Kings in their final league game.

'They outplayed us tonight': Ryan Rickelton admits as MI face Eliminator test

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians ’ hopes of finishing in the top two of the IPL 2025 league stage came crashing down on Monday, after a 7-wicket defeat to Punjab Kings in Jaipur. The five-time champions ended the league phase in fourth place with 16 points from eight wins and six losses — a respectable tally, but not enough to secure the coveted double chance in the playoffs.Known for their sluggish starts, MI once again stumbled early in the season, losing four of their first five matches. However, a remarkable turnaround — powered by Suryakumar Yadav ’s dream run (640 runs in 14 games) and the bowling prowess of Trent Boult (19 wickets) and Jasprit Bumrah (17) — saw them win six games in a row and book a playoff berth with one match to spare.Despite the strong comeback, missing out on the top-two finish could haunt them. Teams finishing in the top two get two shots at making the final — a clear advantage in the high-stakes playoffs.Now, MI will have to tread the harder path via the Eliminator on May 30, needing to win two knockout matches to reach the final.The greater concern, however, lies in MI’s historical performance pattern.All five of their IPL titles (2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020) have come in seasons where they finished in the top two of the league stage.They’ve reached the top two six times in 18 seasons — and converted five of those into championship wins. Crucially, they’ve never won the IPL after finishing outside the top two.Further compounding their challenge, MI are winless this season against the three other playoff teams — Punjab Kings, Gujarat Titans and Royal Challengers Bengaluru — having lost all four encounters.For the Hardik Pandya-led side, the road ahead is as difficult as ever. With history against them and form questionable against the remaining contenders, Mumbai Indians must produce something special to rewrite the script and chase a record sixth title.","Mumbai Indians' hopes of finishing in the top two of the IPL 2025 league stage came crashing down on Monday.

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

Poll Do you think KL Rahul should return to India's T20 squad for the 2026 World Cup? Yes, he has the experience. No, we need new talent.

Senior Indian cricketer KL Rahul has expressed his desire to return to India's T20 squad ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which India will host. The 33-year-old batsman, who last played T20 internationals for India in the 2022 World Cup semifinal against England, believes his time away from the format has helped him reassess his white-ball game.Rahul recently completed his IPL 2025 season with Delhi Capitals, scoring 539 runs in 13 matches at a strike rate of 149.72, marking his fifth 500-plus run season in six years. Despite not qualifying for the playoffs, his performance demonstrated his consistent batting form.""Yes, I want to get back in the T20 team and the World Cup is on my mind, but for now it's just trying to enjoy how I'm playing right now,"" Rahul told Sky Sports.The veteran batsman acknowledged the evolution of T20 cricket and his need to adapt to the changing pace of the game.""I obviously had some time to think about my white-ball game, I was quite happy with my performances and where I was. But (there) was a time probably 15 months ago or 12 months ago where I realised that the game is slightly getting ahead or it's changing and becoming much more faster.""Rahul highlighted the importance of boundary-hitting in modern cricket's success.""...that it's become more about the team that hits more boundaries is winning the games more often than the team that's, I can't say playing smarter, but the team that doesn't hit as many boundaries is always finding themselves on the losing side.""The break from T20 internationals has given Rahul time for self-reflection and improvement.""So that's where white-ball cricket is getting and I haven't been part of the T20 team in the last couple of years. That's given me some time to think about my T20 game as well.""Quiz: Who's that IPL player? ""So, overall, just sitting and thinking about where I can get better, where the game's gone and what I need to do to catch up with the game and what can I do to perform and get back in the T20 team, what can I do to become an important player for my team in ODI and T20 overall in white-ball cricket...""Rahul has maintained his position in India's ODI team, contributing significantly to India's recent Champions Trophy victory with 140 runs in five matches at a strike rate of 97.90.Throughout his career spanning over a decade, Rahul has adapted to various batting positions in both ODIs and Tests.""If you have seen how my career has gone, I don't think I really had a choice, or I have never been a player to speak with the selectors and sit with the captain and tell the captain that this is what I want to do,"" he reflected on his career flexibility.""I just want to be in the team and whatever challenge is thrown at me, I have found that's better for me to adapt to rather than me trying to sit and think about what I need to do,"" Rahul said.Regarding India's recent Test performances, Rahul addressed the team's struggles in their home series against New Zealand and the Border Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.""Last couple of Test series we should have batted better. Losing three Tests at home in conditions that we know. New Zealand found a way of keeping us quiet, not giving us easy boundaries. We had to really work hard for runs and that built pressure and we played some bad shots,"" said Rahul.He further analyzed the team's performance against New Zealand and Australia.""The wicket had a bit for spinners but they found a way to put pressure. If we had batted better we'd be at a better place against New Zealand. And then somehow we carried the habit of not being able to win crucial moments in the game and did the same mistakes in Australia.""India, currently the T20 Champions, will co-host the upcoming World Cup with Sri Lanka early next year.","KL Rahul has expressed his desire to return to India's T20 squad ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

A day after the French Open honored Rafael Nadal , dozens of spectators began selling the clay-colored “Merci Rafa” T-shirts handed out at Sunday’s tribute — with some listings reaching up to 500 euros ($540).The shirts, marked with the French phrase for “Thank You Rafa” and the date “25.05.2025,” were given to fans attending the ceremony on Court Philippe-Chatrier to celebrate the 14-time French Open champion.Distributed in varying shades of clay, the T-shirts were part of a coordinated tribute. Fans were asked to wear them, creating a giant mosaic in the stands that spelled out “RG14,” a nod to Nadal's 14 titles in Paris.Within minutes of the event, listings began appearing on resale platforms, including the clothing marketplace Vinted, which had 30 shirts listed as of Monday.One seller, Maxime Berthuis, listed his shirt for 500 euros, shipping fees excluded.“I’m not going to wear the T-shirt anyway,” Berthuis told The Associated Press, adding he bought a ticket to the ceremony for less than 40 euros ($43). “Honestly, I don’t know how I’ll spend the money yet.”He said he had received several offers since posting the listing on Sunday, along with a slew of angry messages from Nadal devotees.Another user who listed a 2XL size T-shirt for 150 euros ($170) said it was simply much too big for her.French Tennis Federation president Gilles Moretton said he was stunned by how much the T-shirts were being sold for.“Some of the prices I saw scared me,” he said on Monday. “It’s a bit sad to see people profit off the ‘Merci Rafa’ shirts. We weren’t going to collect them after the ceremony. We created something unique — and maybe that uniqueness explains why this is happening.”Moretton said he did not receive a shirt himself, despite standing near Nadal during the tribute.“I’m also looking for a T-shirt, but I’m not about to go on Vinted,” he said.","Rafael Nadal was honored at a tribute ceremony at Roland-Garros on Sunday.

India Test squad vs England: Ajit Agarkar full press conference

Poll Do you think India will win the World Test Championship under Shubman Gill's captaincy? Yes, they have a strong chance. No, too many uncertainties.

Former Indian cricket captain Anil Kumble expressed confidence in Shubman Gill 's ability to lead the Indian Test team during a chat at an Australian Summer of Cricket 2025-26 event in Mumbai on Monday. The 25-year-old Gill is set to captain India in the upcoming five-match England tour, marking a transition phase following the Test retirements of Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , and Ravichandran Ashwin Kumble addressed the unique challenges of leading the Indian national team compared to franchise cricket while discussing Gill's appointment.""Captaincy for India is slightly different to captaining a franchise or any state side; it comes with its own responsibilities and the pressure. But I'm sure Shubman will figure it out and I think he is capable,"" Kumble stated.The legendary spinner acknowledged the significant change in Indian cricket's landscape with the departure of three key players.""Transition is bound to happen and with three pillars of Indian cricket, for a long period of time, not being available. It's got to be different for us too, as fans too, when the Indian cricket team takes the ground in the first Test, not to see three names there,"" he said.Kumble expressed optimism about the new era under Gill's leadership.""But it's the start of a young team and it's a new cycle of WTC, which I'm sure this current team would look to win and then get into that final and hopefully hold the trophy one day, so that's something that I'm sure Shubman will try and create that kind of a legacy,"" he added.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? The former captain discussed the challenges facing Kohli and Rohit, who will continue playing ODI cricket.""It's not easy to just do what they need to in terms of preparing for an ODI, which is six months down the line. It's going to be a challenge, no matter who you are and how well you have had your career over the years,"" Kumble said.He emphasized the importance of celebrating these veteran players' contributions.""But they are champion players, so they know how to sort of manoeuvre that, and it's important to celebrate champion players as long as they play. You go into thread bare of each performance as to how they should have played or how they could have played,"" he noted.Kumble addressed their World Cup aspirations.""What is important is to celebrate whatever is out there with the two players. Ideally, they would like to play until the 2027 World Cup, because that's something that did not happen. We saw that 2023 final with Australia holding the trophy,"" he said.India is scheduled to play three ODIs and five T20Is in Australia in October this year.Kumble highlighted potential emerging talents, particularly mentioning Sai Sudharsan.""The legends who are no longer playing in the other format will certainly want to make a mark, Virat and Rohit, and I'm sure a lot of people would want to watch that in Australia,"" he remarked.He expressed confidence in new players making their mark.""I feel someone like Yashasvi Jaiswal... Sai Sudharsan, I think, will make it to that team although he's not a part of it. But I think he will, based on the performances is going to have in England and he'll be someone to watch out for,"" Kumble stated.He also mentioned expectations for the T20 format.""Of course, in the T20 format, Suryakumar is someone who I'm sure all of us would want to watch. I have a feeling that one of the (top) performers from this IPL will be a part of that too. I don't know who it is, but I'm sure one of the uncapped players, there have been wonderful performances and India will certainly not overlook those. The selectors will want to sort of capitalise on one of those players to be a part of Australia,"" he concluded.",Anil Kumble expressed confidence in Shubman Gill's ability to lead the Indian Test team.

Swiatek cruises through

Carlos Alcaraz powered into the French Open second round on Monday with a resounding win to start his title defence, while world number one Jannik Sinner and three-time defending women's champion Iga Swiatek also progressed at Roland Garros.Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz struck 31 winners in a 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 victory over Italian qualifier Giulio Zeppieri and will face Hungary's Fabian Marozsan in round two. Alcaraz is now on an eight-match winning streak at the French Open and also took Olympic silver at Roland Garros last year, losing the final to Novak Djokovic.""The first round is never easy, and coming here as a champion is even more difficult,"" said the Spaniard, who has won both the Monte Carlo Masters and Italian Open titles on clay this year. ""But I started well, found my rhythm, and I'm happy with my start.""Two-time reigning Australian Open champion Sinner saw off home hope Arthur Rinderknech 6-4, 6-3, 7-5 despite a brief third-set wobble in the night session on Court Philippe Chatrier.It was the first of two successive French opponents for Sinner, who will meet the retiring Richard Gasquet in the second round after the 38-year-old extended his career with a 6-2, 2-6, 6-3, 6-0 win over wildcard Terence Atmane in his 22nd and final Roland Garros.""I know you're going to support him (Gasquet), it's OK, I know that,"" Sinner told the crowd, who earlier greeted his arrival on court with loud cheers. ""I'm just happy to share a court with him.""The 75th-ranked Rinderknech fought hard to the delight of the home fans and led 4-0 in the third set. But he failed to serve out the set at 5-3 ahead and Sinner roared back to secure a straight-sets success with a run of five successive games.Taylor Fritz of the USA became the first high-profile casualty in the men's draw as the fourth seed lost 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 to German Daniel Altmaier. Norwegian seventh seed Casper Ruud, a two-time French Open runner-up, got his bid for a first Grand Slam title under way with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 win over veteran Spanish qualifier Albert Ramos-Vinolas.Greek star Stefanos Tsitsipas, the losing finalist in 2021, beat Tomas Martin Etcheverry of Argentina 7-5, 6-3, 6-4. Two-time quarter-finalist Holger Rune of Denmark also progressed, recovering from losing a first-set tie-break to defeat Roberto Bautista Agut in four sets, as did French number one Arthur Fils.Swiatek entered the tournament on a near year-long trophy drought but showed signs of form in a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Slovakia's Rebecca Sramkova. Her struggles since the last of her four French Open titles have been well documented, but she broke her 42nd-ranked opponent four times in a strong display.The five-time Grand Slam champion's remarkable win-loss record in the tournament now stands at 36-2. ""I knew I needed to stay proactive and try to use my weapons. I'm happy with my performance and it was a solid match,"" said Swiatek, who also beat Sramkova in the second round of this year's Australian Open.Swiatek, who has dropped to fifth in the world rankings, will next face former US Open champion Emma Raducanu after the Briton defeated China's Wang Xinyu 7-5, 4-6, 6-3.Raducanu is playing at the French Open for the first time since a second-round exit on her debut in 2022. Four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka, who had a match point against Swiatek in the second round at Roland Garros a year ago, was knocked out by Spanish 10th seed Paula Badosa in a tense three-set battle.Badosa, an Australian Open semi-finalist earlier this year, fought back from a set down to win 6-7 (1/7), 6-1, 6-4. Osaka has still never got past the third round at Roland Garros.Former Wimbledon winner Elena Rybakina battled past Argentinian qualifier Julia Riera 6-1, 4-6, 6-4, two days after lifting her first WTA title since April 2024 in Strasbourg.American ninth seed Emma Navarro suffered an embarrassing 6-0, 6-1 loss to Spanish world number 68 Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in just 57 minutes, only winning a game when her opponent double-faulted to gift her a break when serving for a double-bagel victory.But her compatriot Madison Keys, the reigning Australian Open champion, had no such problems, swatting aside Daria Saville 6-2, 6-1.",Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek both win opening matches at French Open 2025.

Back-to-Back ICC triumphs: A new era for Indian cricket

NEW DELHI: India’s long and agonising wait for a major ICC ODI title finally ended in Dubai, where Rohit Sharma’s men held their nerve to beat New Zealand by four wickets in the 2025 Champions Trophy final.The Men in Blue, unbeaten throughout the tournament, produced a clinical performance to capture their third Champions Trophy crown, sparking scenes of unbridled celebration among players and fans alike.From Ravindra Jadeja’s match-winning strike to fireworks lighting up the Dubai sky, it was a night to remember — one that sealed India’s return to the pinnacle of world cricket in emphatic fashion.Ravindra Jadeja knew it was done the moment he struck the winning boundary. His excitement sent him crashing into New Zealand pacer William O'Rourke, but nobody cared. The Dubai International Stadium erupted in celebration as India chased down a tricky target of 252 with an over and four wickets to spare, clinching their third ICC Champions Trophy title.Captain Rohit Sharma led from the front with a measured 76 off 83 deliveries, setting up a strong foundation with fellow opener Shubman Gill (31).India looked well on course at 105/0 before a dramatic collapse saw them slip to 122/3, with the spinners applying the brakes.Rohit’s stumping off Rachin Ravindra in the 27th over stunned the packed crowd into silence, but KL Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, and Axar Patel played crucial knocks to bring India back into control. Iyer’s 48 and Axar’s 29 came in a pressure situation where New Zealand’s spin trio – Mitchell Santner, Michael Bracewell and Ravindra – were tightening the noose.As Rahul (34 not out) calmly guided India to the finish line, the fireworks erupted, players draped themselves in the tri-colour, and the crowd danced to patriotic anthems like “Lehra Do” and “Chak De India.” The final act came from Jadeja, who slashed a wide delivery past point and sealed the match – and the tournament.India’s victory in the 2025 Champions Trophy marks the end of a 12-year wait for an ICC ODI title, the last being in 2013 CT under MS Dhoni. In doing so, they also avenged their 2000 final loss to the same opponents, New Zealand.This latest win adds to India’s glittering trophy cabinet:India's dominance was on full display throughout the tournament, finishing unbeaten with wins against Bangladesh, Pakistan and New Zealand in the group stage, followed by a thrilling semi-final victory over Australia. The team’s consistency, depth, and ability to handle pressure highlighted their evolution into a world-beating white-ball side.New Zealand’s innings, though competitive, fell just short of a winning total. After electing to bat, the Kiwis started brightly, with Rachin Ravindra (37) and Will Young (15) adding 57 for the first wicket. However, India's spin duo of Varun Chakravarthy (2/45) and Kuldeep Yadav (2/40) struck in regular intervals to stall their progress.Daryl Mitchell (63) and Michael Bracewell (53*) stitched together a late surge, adding 46 runs for the sixth wicket, propelling New Zealand to 251/7. While the total was respectable on a sluggish Dubai pitch, it wasn’t enough to contain an in-form Indian lineup.The win sparked wild celebrations not just on the ground but across the country. From Delhi to Dubai, fans rejoiced, dancing in the streets, bursting crackers, and chanting slogans for the Men in Blue.The BCCI announced a massive Rs 58 crore cash prize for the Indian team, rewarding players, support staff, and selectors for their contribution to the historic win.“This financial recognition honours the players, coaching and support staff and members of the Men’s Selection Committee,” the BCCI said in a statement.Each of the 15 squad members will receive Rs 3 crore, while the entire ICC prize money of Rs 20 crore (US $ 2.24 million) will be divided among the players. Head coach Gautam Gambhir will also receive Rs 3 crore, in recognition of his strategic planning and leadership. Support staff members will receive Rs 50 lakh each, while chief selector Ajit Agarkar will earn Rs 30 lakh, and other selectors Rs 25 lakh each.This was India’s second ICC title in 2025, following the U19 Women’s World Cup win, and their third major title in under a year, including the 2024 T20 World Cup victory. This period marks a golden era for Indian cricket, with a blend of youth, experience, and leadership finally delivering on years of promise.“Winning back-to-back ICC titles is special and this reward recognises Team India’s dedication and excellence on the global stage,” said BCCI president Roger Binny.","India beat New Zealand by four wickets in the 2025 Champions Trophy final.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of Royal Challengers Bengaluru's (RCB) final league-stage match against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), the team’s spin bowling coach Malolan Rangarajan addressed the media, reflecting on their recent loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH). He described the defeat, which came after a long break, as a ""good wake-up call"" and emphasised that the focus remains on bowling effectively and putting pressure back on the opposition.RCB are on the verge of sealing a spot in Qualifier 1, which would give them two shots at reaching the IPL final. A win over LSG in Lucknow on Tuesday would take them to 19 points, with nine victories, four defeats, and one no result. Depending on the outcome of the Punjab Kings vs Mumbai Indians clash, a win could also push RCB into the top two.RCB resumed their IPL campaign against SRH on May 23, following a three-week break. Their earlier fixture against Kolkata Knight Riders on May 17 had been washed out due to rain. The break, triggered by cross-border tensions between India and Pakistan, left the team out of match practice.“It is a fact that we lost the last game after a big break. It is down to a lot of reasons, not having played in the last 3 weeks, and being a little rusty.It has been documented very well that it was a good knock on the chin for us, a good wake-up call and now looking forward, even though we have guaranteed a place in one of the playoff games, it is important to focus on Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) and what is going to happen in the Ekana Stadium and that is what we are focusing on, how best we can start bowling, how can we put pressure back on the opponents, so we will be focusing on that. Once that is done, we will look at how and who we play in the playoffs,” Malolan said at the pre-match press conference.Reflecting on their batting performance in the SRH game, where they were bowled out while chasing 232 and lost their last seven wickets for just 16 runs, Malolan admitted there were areas they could have handled better.“But again, I am not going to dwell on the result of what happened. We could have reacted better. We had a few issues that we had to deal with. As far as what came out of the meeting, hopefully you will see that on the ground tomorrow. Like we had a few challenges in M Chinnaswamy Stadium when we played the first few games. I think we have thought of ways we can address what had gone wrong,” he said.Addressing the long-standing pressure on RCB to win their maiden IPL title, Malolan drew an analogy to England’s World Cup drought and pointed out the strides the franchise has made in recent seasons.“England had won the FIFA World Cup in 1966, but yes, it is true that we have not won the IPL title. And we are doing what we can to ensure we become a more consistent and better team. If you look at the last five to six years, RCB has become a more consistent franchise. Whatever people used to say, I don't know if it is true or not, but people used to say that our batting was very good and bowling not so much,” he said.“It feels like we have a balanced team, which gives a little balance to our output. So, our thinking, like all the teams', is to win. What happened in the past is not the responsibility of the current players. It is the responsibility of the current players, which is there today and tomorrow's match. So, if we win, it will be good, but I know everyone, I know each and every player and everyone knows what their wish is and what they want to do. So, there is definitely no pressure where we have not won, because we think how we want to play,” he added.Philip Salt, Virat Kohli, Mayank Agarawal, Rajat Patidar(c), Jitesh Sharma(w), Romario Shepherd, Krunal Pandya, Tim David, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Yash Dayal, Suyash Sharma, Rasikh Dar Salam, Manoj Bhandage, Swapnil Singh, Liam Livingstone, Mohit Rathee, Swastik Chikara, Abhinandan Singh, Josh Hazlewood, Nuwan Thushara, Blessing MuzarabaniMitchell Marsh, Aryan Juyal, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh Pant(w/c), Ayush Badoni, Abdul Samad, Himmat Singh, Shahbaz Ahmed, Akash Deep, Avesh Khan, William ORourke, Akash Maharaj Singh, Ravi Bishnoi, Manimaran Siddharth, David Miller, Arshin Kulkarni, Shardul Thakur, Digvesh Singh Rathi, Prince Yadav, Matthew Breetzke, RS Hangargekar, Yuvraj Chaudhary.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) face Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) on Tuesday.

India Test squad for England tour: Shubman Gill to lead, Rishabh Pant his deputy

Poll What do you think about Cristiano Ronaldo's future with Al-Nassr? He will stay with the club. He will leave for MLS. He will join a rival club like Al-Hilal. He will retire.

The 2024/25 Saudi Pro League season has come to an end, and the end means a familiar sense of disappointment for Cristiano Ronaldo and his teammates. Despite their best efforts, the team have ended the campaign without a trophy, finishing the league campaign in third spot behind Al-Ittihad (champions) and Al-Hilal. Despite the Portuguese No 7's scintillating goals and game-winning performances this year, Ronaldo is forced to accept the reality that he is yet to win the competition since joining the club.After yet another disappointing outing with the Faris Najd, Ronaldo took to X as he posted a rather cryptic message. ""This chapter is over. The story? Still being written. Grateful to all."", Ronaldo posted on X moments after the final whistle in Al-Nassr's final league outing. Incidentally, the team fell 3-2 in the match against Al Fateh, despite Ronaldo handing his side the lead in the 42nd minute with the first goal of the game. The post in question featured him in an Al-Nassr jersey; the one his side donned against Al Fateh on Monday to be specific.While Ronaldo's contract with the Saudi outfit is set to expire on June 30, the player and club is yet to make an official decision regarding his future.Ronaldo's recent post has been the subject of intense discussion on social media, with supporters debating the 'real' meaning behind the post. While the end of the chapter may very well be an allusion to the end of the 2024/25 season, it is difficult to rule out the veteran suggesting that it is the end of his stay with the Saudi giant.Additionally, a special transfer window running from June 1-10 allows the 32 clubs involved in the Club World Cup to sign players. Adding to the same, in a recent podcast with internet personality IShowSpeed, FIFA President Gianni Infantino stated that efforts are being made to pave the way for Ronaldo to be part of the competition despite his side failing to qualify for the tournament set to commence on June 15.40-year-old Ronaldo has had a successful time in front of goal in his near three-year stay, netting 99 times in 111 appearances in all competitions. His overall career tally stands tall at an inimitable 936 so far. This season alone, Ronaldo netted 25 times, at least two more than any other player in the Saudi Pro League. This is the second time in a row that the veteran is ending the league campaign as Saudi Pro League top scorer.With no clear understanding as to whether Ronaldo will continue at Al-Nassr or will part ways with the club, the veteran's next possible club has also become a matter of public discussion.Several reports link the player with a move to the MLS, where rival Lionel Messi plies his trade with Inter Miami. There are also reports that the player will jump ship to rival club Al-Hilal.",Cristiano Ronaldo posts cryptic message on social media after Al-Nassr's 3-2 defeat to Al Fateh.

Challenges and considerations in the potential transfer

Napoli's president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, is extremely optimistic about the Serie A side's possibility of signing the international star, who is apparently moving away from Manchester City in the summer. He also disclosed that De Bruyne has already home in Naples and that their meeting with him and his family went well.In an interview with Rai Sport, De Laurentiis stated,The 33-year-old midfielder has been one of the most important players for Manchester City since joining in 2015 and has been a massive part of their domestic and European success. De Bruyne's contract runs until June 30, 2025, but City have not offered him a new contract, leading the 32-year-old to look elsewhere. Napoli have spoken to the player's agents to 'explain their sporting project' and test his response.The Serie A champions add to Napoli's appeal, with De Bruyne able to continue playing at the highest level of European football. The same applies to Romelu Lukaku, who has been an integral part of Napoli since joining; he and De Bruyne are closer than ever at the national team level.Some Premier League clubs and sides in the Saudi Pro League are also showing interest in the Belgian midfielder, meaning that any potential transfer will face stiff competition. But De Bruyne clearly, as it stands, wants to play in Europe with the top level of the sport.The chase for De Bruyne shows Napoli wants to continue to bolster the squad and build on past accomplishments.

Zavier Gozo's historic goal not enough as Real Salt Lake fall late to Vancouver Whitecaps



What's next for Real Salt Lake?



Real Salt Lake's teenage prospect Zavier Gozo made a dream beginning to his MLS goal-scoring career with a breathtaking strike in the first minute, but it was not enough to prevent Real Salt Lake from suffering a 2-3 defeat at America First Field against Western Conference pace-setters Vancouver Whitecaps. The game was another gritty performance for RSL, as they remain winless in five successive league matches.Zavier Gozo's moment of brilliance arrived just 50 seconds into the match—the seventh-quickest goal in club history—as the Utah native became the third-youngest scorer in Real Salt Lake history. His clinical header was preceded by a rapid-fire strike from Diego Luna , who extended his red-hot streak to eight goals on the season. But even after a record-breaking beginning, RSL could not maintain their early advantage and suffered three consecutive unanswered goals, including a 90th-minute game-winner.18-year-old Zavier Gozo presented Real Salt Lake with an all-dream beginning by thumping home a low shot within a minute after an artful pass from Diego Luna. Three minutes later, Luna profited from a blunder by the goalkeeper to double the lead with a forceful half-volley, becoming the club's top scorer this year.But the celebration was brief in the stands at the America First Field. Vancouver was equalized with a 20th-minute penalty header from captain Brian White and another equalizer five minutes later from the same spot, but this time, after a VAR review, when William Agada was found to have committed a handball in the box, the penalty was converted by White.Despite chances on both sides in the second half, Pedro Vite sealed the win for Vancouver in the 90th minute with a curling left-footed shot from the edge of the box, stunning the RSL faithful and leaving head coach Pablo Mastroeni and his players with nothing once more.The loss leaves Real Salt Lake mired at 12th in the Western Conference with a 4-9-2 record. The club now has nine losses in 15 games and has not won since a 3-1 road win over San Diego on April 26.Also read: Real Salt Lake vs Vancouver: Whitecaps look to regain form ahead of key MLS stretch RSL will look to end their losing streak in a midweek affair on Wednesday, May 28, against Austin FC at Q2 Stadium, and then another road game on Saturday, June 1, against the LA Galaxy.

Stoffel Vandoorne shares their strategy for Tokyo race

It cannot be just a coincidence that Maserati MSG Racing driver Stoffel Vandoorne started from the 14th position on the grid and went on to win the Tokyo E-Prix Round 8. He even managed to beat Nissan’s Oliver Rowland, who had started from pole. Vandoorne shined while others struggled with poor visibility, a slippery track, and grip issues as it rained cats and dogs during the Tokyo race. Not only that, he also recovered from a spin on the wet track to cross the finish line first. The Tokyo winner says it’s all because of how their plan fell in place to perfection.Stoffel Vandoorne revealed that their winning strategy involved a calculated risk of taking the Pit Boost early in the race, which could have worked in their favor if there had been a race stoppage, allowing them to save time during the gap.""It was not an easy race, but a lot of opportunities with the rain and the management. We kind of gamble a little bit with our strategy but it was also calculated at the same time. The plan perfectly played in our hands, and the chances of this happening in Formula E are very, very slim,” Vandoorne told Formula E in an interview.""It was difficult because I had to manage so many things. I was on the radio with my engineer in between laps and he was giving me advice on the gap that I had to Oliver (Rowland) to make sure I was safe enough with my energy.I was struggling, and I was down to 10% at some point and I had to bring the car home so there was a lot of management to do,"" he added.Vandoorne moved to Maserati MSG Racing last season and is in love with his new team. Talking about the same, he said, ""I’m just happy for the team, for myself, it’s been a little while. They are such a good group of people, some familiar faces from the past as well, their vibe is super cool, their base is Monaco and that is my home as well.

I was looking forward to the race being over, to be honest, and when it was over... when I saw her face I just couldn't help but be super emotional.""[The atmosphere] was amazing.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

Poll Do you believe another player will match Nadal's Grand Slam record in the future? Yes, it's possible No, it's too difficult

Ever since Rafael Nadal called time on an inimitable career in tennis, he is yet to take up a racquet. The Spaniard, who has 22 Grand slam titles to his name, claimed that he is yet to pick up a racquet ever since he retired from the sport in November. While the legend assumes that he will do so eventually, he is under the resolve that he will do so only to prepare for exhibition matches.Nadal also admitted to not feeling the same sense of competitiveness that drove him to triumph on all 22 occasions where he clinched Grand slam titles. Nadal, the way things are, does not miss the sport either, as he can rest assured that he gave 'everything' to the sport.""I didn't catch a racquet yet after my retirement. So it's six months without being on a tennis court."", said Nadal in a press conference.""I am having fun. I don’t miss much tennis, because I feel that I (gave) all what I had. I arrive at the day of today with the peace that I can’t be on court. My body doesn't allow me to be on court. So that’s all. I am (at) peace,” he continued. “I did all (that) I could to have the best career possible, and now I am enjoying this new phase of my life, that I am sure going to be less exciting than the tennis career.”,said Nadal.He then compared his state of mind to the way things are when he plays golf. While Nadal does not feel the same sense of competitiveness in the same, it hasn't completely vanished either. ""“I am competitive again. Just to let you know, I am enjoying my daily competitions when I play golf and when I do things, but I think in a much nicer way.”, said the 14-time French Open champion.Despite the long list of achievements Nadal has achieved over an extensive career that spanned 23 years, Nadal remains convinced that his inimitable tally of trophies will someday be matched or bettered by someone else. ""I really feel that if I did it — I don’t consider myself somebody very, very special — another one is going to come and going to achieve that, too,"" he said.That being said, a lot of variables are in play when a player starts out on their journey to greatness. Speaking along those lines, Nadal explained, ""A lot of things need to happen in your favor to make that happen, because you need a long career, because you can’t have a lot of injuries, even if I had (my share). ... You can have injuries, you can have very, very bad days. So you need some luck, too.”Nadal bid an emotional farewell at Roland Garros as he broke down in tears.

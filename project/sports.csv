NEW DELHI: The much-anticipated five-match Test series between India and England kicks off on Friday, June 20, at Headingley, Leeds.As both teams aim for a strong start in the new World Test Championship cycle, weather conditions might play a pivotal role in the outcome of the opening encounter.Cricket fans hoping for an uninterrupted start to the series will be glad to know that the weather on Day 1 (Friday, June 20) looks promising. The forecast indicates high clouds and warm conditions with a high of 31°C and only a 5% chance of rain. The day is expected to remain mostly clear and mild, ideal for a full day’s play.However, Day 2 (Saturday, June 21) brings a change. Showers are predicted around the afternoon, with a 60% chance of precipitation. This could lead to some interruptions during play, though the morning session is expected to be relatively dry.Sunday (Day 3, June 22): A significant drop in temperature (high of 22°C, low of 12°C) with early showers but otherwise partly cloudy skies and only a 4% chance of rain.Monday (Day 4, June 23): Partly sunny and breezy with a 25% chance of a brief morning shower.Tuesday (Day 5, June 24): Cloudy start but clearing skies expected later; 25% chance of rain.From the early pictures, we can suggest that the Headingley pitch is going to be a green one.It is known for assisting seam and swing bowlers, especially in the first two days. Overcast conditions could further enhance movement off the seam.Batters will need to apply themselves early, but the pitch tends to flatten out slightly from Day 3 onwards. Spinners might come into play later in the match as footmarks develop.Overall, while rain may affect Day 2, the rest of the Test should see plenty of action.Shubman Gill (C), Rishabh Pant (VC & WK), Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Karun Nair, Nitish Reddy, Ravindra Jadeja, Dhruv Jurel (WK), Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd.

Antonio Brown has a warrant but police say he’s not running from the law

Antonio Brown’s lawyer is in contact with police as he travels in the Middle East

Former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown is making headlines again, but this time not for football. There’s a serious case involving him, and many are asking if he’s trying to escape. A new report gives updates about where he is and what police plan to do next. The full story includes travel, an arrest warrant, and a violent incident under investigation.On June 12, 2025, The Washington Post shared details of an arrest warrant issued for Antonio Brown. The document includes a very serious charge: attempted murder with a firearm. If apprehended, Brown must pay a $10,000 bond and remain under home arrest according to the warrant.The accusation arises from a shooting event occurring on May 16, 2025 outside the site during a boxing tournament in Miami, Florida; police assert they answered to reports of a gunshot.The report says that an off-duty police officer acting as security claimed to have seen Antonio Brown engaged in a physical confrontation with another guy in the parking lot. Officers came quickly and searched Brown. They let him that evening; he carried no weapon.People at the scene, however, informed police that Brown had shot a pistol.Police later discovered two used bullet casings and a gun holster next door. Before police arrived, the man said to have been shot—later identified as Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu—had already departed the scene; therefore, no arrest was made then.Even though a warrant is now active, Miami Police Chief Manny Morales said on Monday, June 17, 2025, that they do not think Brown is running away. According to a report from the Miami Herald, police say Brown is traveling in the Middle East, but they are not sending anyone to arrest him overseas.Also Read: Antonio Brown Explodes At Media For Framing Him As Attempted Murderer While Police Remain Silent “We’re not going to be sending anybody there,” Chief Morales told the Herald. He also said that the police are speaking with Antonio Brown’s attorney and plan to arrest him once he returns to Florida.The Miami Herald also reported that video footage from someone’s cell phone later showed Brown chasing Nantambu and firing two close-range shots.Investigators later questioned Nantambu, who claimed Brown first assaulted him then chased him with a weapon and fired at him, perhaps brushing his neck. Police claim they are still investigating this developing case while awaiting Brown's arrival back to the U. S.","Former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown is making headlines again, but this time not for football. There's a serious case involving him, and many are asking if he’s trying to escape.

I was like, I didn’t really get much of the Italian genes,” the Fever standout shared.Although, according to her, Clark does not have much of Italian genes in her, her brothers are an exception. “But if you look at my two brothers, they have the more darker complexion. They have a very thick, curly brown hair.I didn’t really get that.”Clark further explained, “I got my other grandmother from England, so. But yeah, I mean, I certainly have Italian roots.”She went on to detail history of her family roots in Italy. “My great grandfather owned a pub on the south side of the Des Moines, and there’s a couple pictures that my mom has and my grandfather and my grandma have, and he just like a big old Italian Man, made hamburgers like he was just like, I don’t, who knows, what else he really did, but, he was just a good guy.”On top of that, Clark admitted that he enjoys Italian food. “But yeah, Italian is also my favorite food. I’ve been lucky enough to go to Italy before but, uh, northern Italy, I’m pretty sure, but you can ask my grandfather.

Jaire Alexander paused his own draft night to celebrate Lamar Jackson ’s big moment in 2018

Jaire Alexander and Lamar Jackson will now play together on the same NFL team

There are some moments in sports that fans never forget - not because of a big play or game-winning touchdown, but because of how authentic and genuine they are. One such moment years ago during the NFL Draft is now going viral again in 2025, and for a very sweet reason. Something big just happened in the NFL, and it brings back that old clip in the best way.To commemorate Lamar Jackson's great year in 2018, Jaire Alexander stopped his own draft night. On April 26, 2018, Green Bay Packers had just selected cornerback Jaire Alexander in the first round of the NFL Draft. Jaire Alexander first met the media as an NFL player during an interview at Arlington, Texas' ATandT Stadium.He was responding to press questions when he saw something on a nearby television. Just chosen by the Baltimore Ravens with the 32nd overall pick, Lamar Jackson—his close friend and former University of Louisville colleague—was waiting.The moment caught Jaire’s eye instantly. He stopped speaking, clapped his hands, smiled wide, and shouted “Let’s go, Lamar!” in front of everyone at the press table.It didn’t matter that it was his press event. Jaire immediately showed his friend love and joy. Captured on camera, that event quickly spread virally across sports media and social media.Fans, athletes, and journalists referred to it as ""heartwarming,"" ""emotional,"" and ""real. "" For someone he loved, it was genuine happiness not cameras or attention.At Louisville, the two players had shared a strong bond. Jaire was known for being a vocal leader on defense, while Lamar led the team with his electric plays at quarterback. That night in Texas, it was clear their connection went far beyond the field.That emotional encounter is now far more important seven years later. Officially signed by the Baltimore Ravens on June 17, 2025, was Jaire Alexander. Having played seven seasons with the Green Bay Packers, he now teams in Baltimore with his former college roommate, Lamar Jackson. Team press release and cross posting over all Ravens' social media sites spread the news.Also Read: Lamar Jackson Ties Spark Speculation After Baltimore Ravens Sign Jaire Alexander In a press briefing that day, Ravens head coach John Harbaugh said, “We’re not just getting a great player in Jaire—we’re bringing in someone who’s already part of the family here.

Kelly Stafford admits weed gummies help her be a better parent to her four daughters



The Morning After with Kit Hoover

Parenting is far from picture-perfect, and no one embraces that reality more candidly than Kelly Stafford. As the wife of Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford and mom to four young daughters, Kelly has never shied away from sharing her unfiltered take on the chaos, challenges, and coping mechanisms that come with motherhood.On a recent episode of her podcast The Morning After, Kelly opened up about how weed gummies have quietly become her go-to method for handling the more stressful parenting moments. “Gummies are great. Sometimes I feel like gummies make me a better parent. They calm me down. It’s like the glass of wine,” she admitted with refreshing honesty.Kelly’s remarks were met with support from guest Kit Hoover, who called the edibles a “glass of patience”—a term Kelly immediately embraced. “Thank you for saying that,” she replied. “I feel a little guilty—and it’s not like I do it every night—but sometimes I’m like, ‘S--t it has been a long day, I don’t want to rip my hair out or their hair out so I am going to just top it off with a little gummy.’”This kind of raw, relatable confession is what has made Kelly a standout voice in the digital space. She isn’t afraid to question traditional ideas of what makes a “good mom,” stating, “As long as they’re in bed, fed and happy and feel loved, who cares how they get there? Like, just get them there.”And while she admits to occasional guilt, she’s found humor in the process. “They’re like, ‘Mommy’s nice tonight,’” she joked, noting how even her daughters notice the shift.The openness Kelly brings to her podcast goes beyond parenting hacks. She’s also discussed her past health scare involving a brain tumor, something she says ultimately strengthened her relationship with Matthew. “It was tough,” she recalled. “But I always say, it helped my marriage. It helped, just like, our family unit in a way. I’m grateful for it … and it’s because there was a good outcome.”While Kelly holds down the home front, Matthew continues to thrive on the field. The Rams quarterback recently secured a contract worth $44 million—with the potential to reach $84 million if he remains on the roster into the 2025 free agency window. With expectations high for the Rams in the upcoming season, especially after their gritty playoff run against the eventual Super Bowl champion Eagles, the Stafford household has plenty on its plate.Still, Kelly remains grounded—juggling life as a mother, podcast host, and NFL wife with a mix of humor, grace, and the occasional gummy. In a world full of filtered family portraits and Instagram-perfect parenting, her honesty is not only refreshing—it’s a breath of much-needed reality.Also Read: Gisele Bundchen gives Tom Brady a cold, silent Father’s Day while she chooses peace and passion with Joaquim Valente","Matthew Stafford’s wife says weed gummies help her be a better parent.

The’ early playoff exit has sparked speculation about major roster changes. One surprising possibility involves forward Rui Hachimura and Kristaps Porzingis of the Boston Celtics.The Boston Celtics could see Hachimura as a cost-effective solution. His expiring contract offers flexibility, making him an appealing trade target.Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk broke down the potential move: ""This is a tricky one. The Boston Celtics are known to desire shedding salary, projecting them as sellers for this offseason. Perhaps with Jayson Tatum missing due to injury, and a vacant forward spot in the starting lineup, the Celtics would view Hachimura's expiring deal as the right fit."" (H/t: Sporting News)- Reliable scoring (13.1 PPG, 50.9% FG this season)- Floor-spacing ability (41.3% from three)- Financial flexibility with his expiring contractA deal centered around Hachimura and Kristaps Porzingis could benefit both teams.Kristaps Porzingis’ upside for LA:- Three-level scoring threat- Rim protection (career 1.8 blocks per game)- Better fit alongside Anthony DavisDespite Porzingis’ injury history and poor 2025 playoffs (7.7 PPG, 31.6% FG), his skill set addresses Los Angeles Lakers’ needs.A third team might be necessary to facilitate the move. Potential trade framework:Derrick White could also be a target for the Lakers if talks expand.- Efficient role player (4th-leading scorer in 2024-25)- Strong off-ball movement and mid-range game- Playoff-tested contributor- Immediate help during Tatum’s absence- Financial flexibility after 2025-26- Better balance between offense and defenseWhile Hachimura isn’t a star, his consistency and contract make him a logical trade piece.

Tom Brady reflects on life lessons from divorce and family

Regret over Gisele Bündchen joke during Netflix roast

Tom Brady may have stepped off the NFL field, but his personal life continues to make headlines. In a recent candid conversation, the former New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback opened up about the emotional toll of his divorce from Gisele Bündchen and the unintended consequences of a joke made at her expense.Tom Brady, who now serves as a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, has gradually embraced a more reflective tone when discussing his split with Gisele Bündchen. “Not everyone is perfect,” he said during a recent interview, emphasizing that many people aren’t equipped early in life to manage the complexities of family. “It's all about having a clear purpose in life and improving little by little,” he added.That introspective approach comes in the wake of years of scrutiny over his marriage and career choices—especially his decision to return to football in 2020 after briefly retiring. That move, which saw him join the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, reignited questions about his priorities.“She didn't feel like I was doing my part for the family. She thought I'd play the whole season, and she'd take care of the house,” Brady admitted, acknowledging the imbalance that may have led to growing tension at home.One moment that clearly still weighs on Brady is his participation in The Roast of Tom Brady on Netflix.While the quarterback appeared to take the jokes in stride during the show, including a jab from comedian Nikki Glaser—“You have seven rings... well, eight now that Gisele gave hers back”—Brady has since revealed the aftermath wasn’t so humorous for his family.“It was hard for my kids, for sure... You don't know what to expect, and I love to laugh at myself... but for my kids, it was really hard,” Brady said in a May appearance on the Impaulsive podcast.Tom Brady has long admitted that his devotion to football shaped every decision in his adult life. “I always felt that way when I stepped onto the field. So many people dedicated their time and energy to me and our team, and I never wanted to let them down,” he said. That mindset, however, may have come at a personal cost—a truth Brady now seems ready to accept as he enters a new chapter post-retirement.Also Read: Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bündchen’s secret plastic surgery strategy in Paris sparked cultural backlash and personal regret In February, the Bündchen welcomed a new baby boy with her boyfriend of nearly two years, Joaquim Valente.

Brought to the Cheetah Rescue and Conservation Centre in Somaliland, she swiftly adapted to her secure new home, thriving under the dedicated care provided by the staff.The center recently welcomed four new residents—a litter of orphaned siblings, also saved from the same unfortunate circumstances of illegal wildlife trafficking. These new arrivals were gently introduced to Taylor Swift once they had settled into their new surroundings.Among them, a particular male cub quickly caught Taylor's attention, and a significant bond began to blossom between the two.Observing this flourishing friendship, the staff at the cheetah center made a charming and fitting decision: they named the 5-month-old male cub Travis Kelce, inspired by the well-known athlete. According to the center, this cheetah, Travis Kelce, embodies qualities similar to his namesake, described as ""playful, confident, and has a winning streak.”The delightful bond between the two cubs has not gone unnoticed. As the center's staff shared in a statement, ""Not only is [cub Taylor Swift] thriving, it looks like we have a little Love Story unfolding on the savannah."" They further emphasized the depth of the two cub's connection, stating, ""The two have become nearly inseparable—grooming each other, napping side by side, and occasionally partaking in friendly roughhousing. ""The male cub's ""rookie stats"" include an approximate sitting height of 50 cm and a length of about 90 cm, along with impressive abilities like ""climbing trees, running fast [and] scarfing down snacks."" It's clear that this young male cheetah is also ""fiercely protective of the things he likes most,"" a sentiment that undeniably includes his dear friend, Taylor Swift, the cheetah cub.Also Read: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift inspire each other to grow as Erin Andrews dubs her with sweet new nickname Isn't it amazing how these two rescued cubs found each other and formed such a special bond?

Blake Lively’s lawsuit allegedly dragged Taylor Swift into uncomfortable territory

Taylor Swift reportedly feels “exploited” while Kelce makes a quiet but pointed move

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s romance has kept headlines buzzing for over a year, but now it’s their friendships that are grabbing attention. According to multiple insider reports, the couple has officially distanced themselves from longtime friends Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, following an ongoing lawsuit involving Lively and actor Justin Baldoni. What started as a strong friendship among four of Hollywood’s most adored faces appears to have unraveled behind closed doors—and fast.Blake Lively’s legal battle with Baldoni over their film It Ends With Us has snowballed into a public spectacle. While Taylor Swift was never directly involved in the project beyond licensing her song My Tears Ricochet, reports suggest she was briefly subpoenaed before her legal team shot down any meaningful connection to the case.Blake Lively's representatives emphasized, ""Taylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie... this document subpoena is designed to use Taylor Swift’s name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case.""Adding fuel to the fallout, TMZ reported that Baldoni’s team accused Lively of threatening to release private text messages to pressure Swift into backing her publicly.Lively’s attorney, however, denied the claim as “categorically false.”An insider told the Daily Mail, ""Right now, if Taylor had one wish, it would be that she never met Blake... it just wasn’t worth the stress."" That sentiment echoed a growing frustration allegedly shared by Travis Kelce, who reportedly unfollowed Ryan Reynolds on Instagram. The couple is said to be “disgusted with Blake and Ryan and how they tried to use Taylor in their fight against Justin Baldoni.”Once known for their Super Bowl suite appearances and cozy group photos, the once-tight squad has fractured. Even mutual friend Gigi Hadid has apparently cooled things off with Lively, indicating deeper rifts within Swift’s inner circle. The drama has reportedly taken a toll on Swift, who is also the godmother to Lively and Reynolds’ three daughters—further complicating the emotional fallout.Also Read: Taylor Swift reportedly saves Travis Kelce’s NFL career as Chiefs star returns leaner and hungry for revenge With fans already speculating about tensions in Swift and Kelce’s relationship, the ripple effects of this Hollywood legal drama could leave lasting scars on friendships once thought unbreakable.",Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have reportedly distanced themselves from Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds.

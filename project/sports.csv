Are India favourites to win 2026 T20 World Cup? | Greenstone Lobo makes a HUGE PREDICTION

MS Dhoni, who always tends to wear a poker face and is usually frugal with his words on cricket, broke character at an event when he was asked about India’s chances in the T20 World Cup. His eyes widened as he ominously declared, “It’s one of the most dangerous teams. Everything that is needed in a good team, they have it.”It’s tough to maintain consistency in a format as fickle as T20 cricket. Yet, this Indian team has reached the tournament with an aura of invincibility. Since the inception of this tournament, only Australia in 2007 and England in 2022 went in as overwhelming favourites. Only England managed to live up to the billing, lifting the trophy at the MCG, though their cricket wobbled soon after. That makes India the first defending T20 champions to take the field still head and shoulders above the rest, much like Australia’s ODI teams in the first decade of the 21st century.The process of forming this formidable and immaculately balanced unit has been a thorough one. It has often bordered on the ruthless, like when the team management and selectors decided that vice-captain Shubman Gill’s style of play— and indifferent form — was disturbing the team’s balance and axed him from the squad.T20 cricket dictates a certain degree of premeditation. It leaves barely any room for reacting on the fly. ‘Flexibility’ soon became the buzzword, so much so that it began to look whimsical during the home series against South Africa in Dec. Captain Suryakumar Yadav preferred to bat behind Axar Patel and Shivam Dube. Gill and Surya’s dip in form coincided, leaving the management desperate to compensate through eccentric moves. The nerves were obvious. Suddenly, playing moderately high-scoring games became the safer zone — a strategy that was outright in defiance of head coach Gautam Gambhir’s core principles.The feisty side of Gambhir’s character was never going to let him enter the tournament by abandoning those principles. The team management pivoted before New Zealand arrived for the T20I series last month. India traded Gill’s conservative approach at the top for Ishan Kishan’s belligerence, which instantly clicked. The pieces fell into place seamlessly. It didn’t matter that Tilak Varma was still recovering from abdominal surgery, that new vice-captain Axar missed a few games due to an index finger injury or that Washington Sundar’s availability for the World Cup remained uncertain.The obsession with a left/right combination has been conveniently chucked out of the window. Batters batted in well-defined roles. There was no need for a major shuffle in the batting order. Specialists are back in vogue. The first indication was bringing Rinku Singh back into the mix. The allrounders came in to bat only from No. 5 and bowled after the specialist bowlers had done their job. India opted for a specialist spinner in Ravi Bishnoi to fill in for allrounder Washington. They have found flexibility within a stable environment. The idea is simple: score big runs and let world-class bowlers like Jasprit Bumrah, Varun Chakravarthy, Arshdeep Singh and Kuldeep Yadav rein in the opposition batting even on the flattest of decks.This T20I team has been in the making since Gambhir took over as head coach. He has enjoyed the most authority in this format compared to the other two formats. He has run experiments over the past 18 months with a clear vision: build a team that thrives on aggression. He has now arrived at a combination that appears stronger than the World Cup-winning team of 2024.There’s a calm in the camp that could have the opposition shaking in their boots. The fact that Varma has only just rejoined the team, and that Washington’s recovery status remains a mystery, doesn’t seem to perturb the management. They are in a space where they don’t lose sleep over finding a like-for-like replacement for Washington should he fail to get fit during the tournament. In that case, Bishnoi retaining his place won’t be a surprise.Axar did bat at No. 5 in the warm-up match against South Africa on Wednesday. That had more to do with giving him time at the crease. But one doesn’t really see the need for him to bat so high when India begin their campaign on Saturday. Harshit Rana’s emergence as a capable lower-order hitter at No. 8 has given the team management the luxury of fielding more specialist bowlers. Like Dhoni said, the team has everything going for it — form, combination and familiar conditions. But he also warned that dew, and one off day at a crucial time, could stop this juggernaut. It’s India’s World Cup to lose.",India have reached the tournament with an aura of invincibility. The obsession with a left/right combination has been conveniently chucked out of the window.

Are India favourites to win 2026 T20 World Cup? | Greenstone Lobo makes a HUGE PREDICTION

India enter the T20 World Cup at home with a squad that appears settled, dangerous, and confident, building on the approach that brought them success in the Caribbean 19 months ago. The team that lifted the title in 2024 under Rohit Sharma found a clear method in the shortest format, led by attacking intent at the top, and the current group has taken that template forward.Former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta believes the side has progressed further since that triumph.""There are a few changes (to the side) but this team has gone to the next level since Rohit inspired his team to that trophy couple of years ago. The way they played against New Zealand recently was something special. Unless they have one bad day, which can happen in this format, India should be able to win the trophy again,"" Dasgupta was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Eight players from the 2024 World Cup-winning squad remain part of the Suryakumar Yadav-led side. While Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are no longer in the setup, India have moved on quickly, with Hardik Pandya continuing to play a key role as the balance point of the team.Since the final win over South Africa in Barbados, India have added Abhishek Sharma and Varun Chakaravarthy to the group. Both now sit at the top of the ICC batting and bowling rankings respectively. Tilak Varma has also become a regular after strong performances in the Asia Cup last year. Shivam Dube, who featured in 2024, has since added consistency with both bat and ball.India’s pace attack is led by Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh, with Harshit Rana providing cover after recent all-round contributions. Ishan Kishan, picked as a reserve wicketkeeper-batter, has strengthened his case after a strong series against New Zealand and is expected to start the tournament opener against the United States.The recent series win over New Zealand underlined India’s depth, even though Sanju Samson struggled for runs at the top alongside Abhishek Sharma. Since October 2023, India have recorded the highest number of 200-plus totals, with 20 such scores, and also lead in six-hitting rate, striking one every 10.99 balls.Much of that output has come from Abhishek Sharma, whose strike rate of 194.74 stands out. His approach has reshaped India’s powerplay batting.With the first match less than a week away, the team management’s main concern remains the batting order, particularly Samson’s form. Kuldeep Yadav may also find selection difficult if both Bumrah and Arshdeep are included.“It is sad that Sanju is not in form. And it also kind of makes things a little tricky for the Indian side. But it was good to see Tilak playing that side game yesterday.“But the next challenge is how serious are you looking at a left-right combination? Yeah. And if Surya bats at four, then you're looking at top three left-handers (Abhishek, Kishan, Tilak), which I personally think it's fine,” Dasgupta said, as cited by PTI.While India go into the tournament as one of the leading contenders, Dasgupta feels conditions later in the competition could pose challenges as pitches slow down. He pointed out the absence of Kohli, who previously played the role of stabiliser when batting became difficult.“Virat played a very, very important role in the last World Cup because of pitches that he played on. So if the pitch is doing something and you have the power-hitters like you do, it is very, very difficult for them to adapt. Because that is the only way they play.“But I still think you need somebody who can play that holding role. Not necessarily that you have to play that role in every game.“When I look at Tilak and Surya, India have got in this side these two guys who can change their game based on conditions,” Dasgupta added.","India enter the T20 World Cup at home with a squad that appears settled, dangerous, and confident.

India Women's cricketers to become CROREPATIS after World Cup win!

Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) captain Smriti Mandhana has a chance to lead her team to a second Women’s Premier League (WPL) title and draw level with Mumbai Indians (MI) in terms of trophies, while the Delhi Capitals (DC) will look to end their run of final defeats when the two sides meet in the final on Thursday.RCB, champions in 2024, have had a strong campaign this season. They have often responded well in difficult situations and showed consistency early, becoming the first team in WPL history to start a season with five straight wins. Throughout the tournament, different players have stepped up at key moments to shape results.In the previous match, Grace Harris played a major role with 75 against UP Warriorz, helping RCB to an eight-wicket win after a mixed season. Earlier, Gautami Naik scored 73 against Gujarat Giants, which proved crucial in a 61-run victory. RCB will now aim to win their second title and match Mumbai Indians’ tally.The RCB batting unit, including Mandhana, Harris, Georgia Voll and Richa Ghosh, has not been consistent across the season, but timely contributions have often been enough. In the bowling department, pacers Nadine de Klerk and Sayali Satghare have delivered important spells.De Klerk is currently the third-highest wicket-taker of the season with 15 wickets from eight matches, including a best of 4 for 22. Spinner Shreyanka Patil has also played a key role, highlighted by her five-wicket haul against Gujarat Giants.RCB’s strength has been their ability to perform as a unit at key moments. Mandhana will hope more players contribute in the final as they take on Delhi Capitals.Delhi Capitals, led this season by Jemimah Rodrigues, are chasing their first WPL title after finishing runners-up in all the previous three editions.Their campaign has been driven largely by their bowling attack. Pacers Chinelle Henry and Nandani Sharma have made early inroads with the new ball. Nandani has taken 16 wickets this season, making her the second-highest wicket-taker, and her performances have put her in contention for higher honours.Delhi’s batting has also shown improvement in recent matches. Lizelle Lee contributed at the top in the Eliminator against Gujarat Giants, while Shafali Verma found form and added a half-century stand with Lee. Laura Wolvaardt has provided stability at the top order through the season.With both batting and bowling influenced by South African players, the Capitals have benefited from a group that has played together for several years. That understanding could help them in the final as they look to end their title wait under Rodrigues, who will be hoping for a strong performance after a quiet season so far.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) captain Smriti Mandhana has a chance to lead her team to a second Women’s Premier League (WPL) title.

By the end of the 1980s, Test cricket had already seen great fast bowlers, long spells, broken bodies and careers affected by workload. What it had not seen was certainty that one man, alone, could push the limits of what was thought possible for a bowler in the longest format. Richard Hadlee was quietly moving towards that edge.New Zealand cricket, for much of Hadlee’s career, lived with that reality. They did not have depth in numbers or a long production line of stars. What they had was Hadlee. He bowled with the new ball, returned with the old one, and often did the work of several players rolled into one. By 1990, he was 39, nearing the end of his international career, but still central to everything New Zealand did on a cricket field.The Test against India at Christchurch followed a familiar pattern. New Zealand built a strong base through batting, with John Wright playing an innings of control and patience. His 185, spread over nine hours, took the hosts to 459. India then walked into a situation they had seen many times before in that era: facing Hadlee with the new ball.Hadlee and Danny Morrison worked in tandem. India lost wickets steadily and were bowled out for 164.Hadlee finished with 3 for 45. Morrison took five. The follow-on was enforced.India showed more fight in the second innings. W.V. Raman and Manoj Prabhakar added 80 for the opening wicket. Raman reached 96, Prabhakar made 40. When Prabhakar was dismissed, Sanjay Manjrekar came in. He faced four balls.Hadlee bowled one that rattled the stumps. Manjrekar was out for four. It was a routine dismissal in the context of the match. In the context of cricket history, it was not.That wicket took Richard Hadlee to 400 Test wickets. No one had been there before. Not Malcolm Marshall. Not Dennis Lillee. Not Fred Trueman. Hadlee raised his arms and looked upwards.India were later bowled out for 296. Hadlee ended the innings with figures of 4 for 69, taking seven wickets in the match. Morrison took six. New Zealand were left with a target of two runs, which they chased without delay to win by ten wickets.The match itself was straightforward. The moment was not.Hadlee’s numbers already placed him among the greats. He had won matches almost on his own. He was also more than a fast bowler. With the bat, he could change games from the lower order, and that combination placed him alongside Ian Botham, Imran Khan and Kapil Dev as one of the defining allrounders of the 1980s.What made 400 different was not just the round number. It was the idea it broke. Years earlier, Fred Trueman had said of reaching 300 wickets, ""Whoever does it will be bloody tired."" Hadlee, at 39, did not look tired. He looked in control. He would go on to take 31 more wickets before retiring later that year, finishing with 431 in 86 Tests at an average of 22.29. In his last game for New Zealand against England, he picked up a five-wicket haul, finishing with a wicket with his very last delivery.Muttiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne would make their Test debuts two years later. They would push the numbers far beyond what existed then. But on February 4, 1990, that future was unknown. Four hundred was uncharted territory.On February 4, 1990, cricket found a new ceiling.","Richard Hadlee took his 400th Test wicket on February 4, 1990.

Brief scores:

In-form Ishan Kishan continued his red-hot form with a rapid half-century as India secured a 30-run win over South Africa in their only warm-up match ahead of the T20 World Cup on Wednesday at DY Patil Stadium. The wicketkeeper-batter raced to 53 off just 20 balls, smashing seven sixes and two boundaries, cementing his spot in the top order alongside Abhishek Sharma.The Indian batters collectively posted a daunting 241 for five on a flat track, with Ishan and Abhishek putting on an explosive 80-run partnership inside the powerplay. Abhishek contributed 24 off 17 balls before retiring, allowing Ishan to continue his onslaught and retire unbeaten after reaching his fifty, ensuring both got a final hit ahead of India’s opener against the USA on February 7.India rotated their bowling arsenal, using nine different bowlers, including Abhishek Sharma, who picked up 2/32 in three overs, to restrict the Proteas to 210/7. Harshit Rana, however, was forced to leave after just one over due to discomfort in his run-up.South Africa’s experimental opening pair of George Linde (0) and Aiden Markram (38 retired out) failed to make an impact, with Linde dismissed for a duck by Arshdeep Singh.Ryan Rickelton top-scored for the visitors with 44 off 21 balls, while Jason Smith contributed 35 off 23. Dewald Brevis fell cheaply, but Tristan Stubbs provided resistance with a 21-ball 45 not out, including four sixes.Other notable performances for India included Tilak Varma, who made a quick 45 off 19 balls before being bowled by Marco Jansen, and Suryakumar Yadav , who struck 30 off 16 balls. Vice-captain Axar Patel added 35 off 23, while Hardik Pandya finished with a fiery 30 from just 10 deliveries. Rinku Singh contributed 16 before being hit on the helmet.India’s batting dominance, combined with disciplined bowling, ensured a comfortable 30-run victory in their final warm-up ahead of the tournament.India 240/5 in 20 overs (Ishan Kishan 53, Tilak Varma 45; Marco Jansen 1/18) beat South Africa 210/7 in 20 overs (Ryan Rickelton 44, Tristan Stubbs 45*; Abhishek Sharma 2/32) by 30 runs.","India beat South Africa by 30 runs in their final warm-up match ahead of the T20 World Cup.

Everything is special about Vaibhav Suryavanshi: Vikram Rathour

NEW DELHI: India reached the ICC Under-19 World Cup final after beating Afghanistan by seven wickets on Wednesday in Harare, riding on a century from Aaron George and half-centuries from Vaibhav Sooryavanshi and Ayush Mhatre. India will face England in the final on Friday. This will be India’s 10th appearance in an Under-19 World Cup final.Chasing 311, India completed the target in 41.1 overs, recording their highest successful chase in the history of the tournament. Aaron George anchored the innings with 115 off 104 balls, while Sooryavanshi scored 68 off 33 balls and Mhatre made 62 off 59 deliveries. India maintained a run rate of over seven runs per over for most of the chase.Afghanistan had earlier posted 310 for four after being asked to bat. The total was built around centuries from Faisal Shinozada and Uzairullah Niazal. Faisal scored 110 off 93 balls, while Niazal remained unbeaten on 101 off 86 balls as the Indian bowlers found it difficult to take wickets regularly.India began the chase aggressively, with Sooryavanshi setting the tone at the top. He scored freely against off-spinner Wahidullah Zadran and was dropped on 22 by Niazal at point off Abdul Aziz.Sooryavanshi continued to attack and also hit pacer Nooristani Omarzai for a six. His innings ended when an attempted pull shot off Omarzai resulted in a catch by Osman Sadat inside the circle. The opening stand ended at 93.After Sooryavanshi’s dismissal, Aaron George and Ayush Mhatre added 114 runs for the second wicket in just over 17 overs, taking India past the 200-run mark in the 27th over. Mhatre, who had struggled earlier in the tournament, reached his fifty during this partnership. While Mhatre played the attacking role, Aaron continued to bat steadily.Mhatre was dismissed after his half-century, but Aaron continued at the crease and brought up his hundred in 95 balls with a boundary through mid-wicket. Aaron later added 96 runs for the third wicket with Vihan Malhotra as India moved close to the target. Aaron was dismissed before the finish, but the result was already in India’s favour.India’s chase, led by Aaron George and supported by Sooryavanshi and Mhatre, ensured a place in the final.","Chasing 311, India completed the target in 41.1 overs, recording their highest successful chase in the history of the tournament.

“Picture abhi baaki hain,” says Biju Nair. The former Services team coach has watched Aaron George from close quarters and, on a sun-drenched Wednesday afternoon in Harare, he saw another important chapter being written.India were chasing 311 in the U-19 World Cup semifinal on the back of twin hundreds from Afghanistan’s Faisal Shinozada and Uzairullah Niazal. By the time Aaron walked back with 115 off 104 balls, India were through to their 10th U-19 World Cup final. They now await England in the summit clash. This was the highest chase at the showpiece event, completed with nearly nine overs to spare.“He should have finished the game off today,” Biju tells TOI. “Very calm head on his shoulders. He anchored the innings to a nicety.” Around him, Vaibhav Sooryavanshi and Ayush Mhatre played their IPL-styled cameos, but it was Aaron who gave the chase its spine.Sooryavanshi slammed a 33-ball 68, while India captain Ayush Mhatre, who walked in at No. 3, scored a stylish 59-ball 62. Together, they helped India ace a tricky chase.“Aaron can play all kinds of innings,” Biju says. “He can match Vaibhav’s blitz or conjure the back-to-the-wall rearguard in the final innings of a Test match.”It hasn’t been easy. Aaron had been getting starts but was not converting them. After sitting out the first two games of this tournament due to an elbow injury, he registered scores of 7, 23 and 16. “Before this game, I made it a point to keep his morale up,” he adds.Aaron’s response was emphatic: a century of poise built on precision rather than power.Back home in Hyderabad, one man could barely contain himself. “Did you see that straight six he hit?” Aaron’s father, Easo Varghese, asks. “That was the shot of the game for me. His knock could not have come at a more opportune moment.”Raised in Hyderabad with roots in Kerala — Easo hails from Mavelikara, mother Preeti from Kottayam — the foundations were laid early. A former Hyderabad police sub-inspector, Easo recalls spotting something special when Aaron was just four. “At my in-laws’ place, he picked up a plastic bat and played straight. No slogging. That’s when I knew his talent.”In a tense World Cup semifinal, that straight bat told its own compelling tale. As Biju reminds us, there’s plenty more to come from Aaron.","India were chasing 311 in the U-19 World Cup semifinal on the back of twin hundreds from Afghanistan’s Faisal Shinozada and Uzairullah Niazal.

The broadcast rights for the Indian Super League (ISL) 2025-26 season have been awarded to FanCode after their technical and commercial bids edged six other competitors.

This is in line with Dream Sports group’s overall vision of making sports better,” said FanCode co-founder Yannick Colaco in a statement.FanCode's initial bid of Rs 8.62 crore for Package A remains to be ratified considering they will not be responsible for the production of the ISL. That job has been awarded to Kolkata-based KPS Studios LLP, who had only for Package E. KPS Studios had previously handled the production of I-League, Durand Cup and Bengal Super League matches.FanCode, UK-based Two Circles, Anandabazar Patrika (ABP), JioStar, Monarch with PR Solutions, Sportzworks and Kaleidoscope (KPS Studios) had shown interest in broadcasting and producing the ISL.Two Circles and Monarch with PR Solutions were both disqualified during the commercial bids evaulation part of the process.

NEW DELHI: Bengaluru FC players, including India legend Sunil Chhetri , have agreed to take a pay cut for the truncated Indian Super League (ISL) season starting February 14, with club owner Parth Jindal thanking the squad for making the “sacrifice” in the best interests of both the franchise and the sport.Jindal said the management held open and honest discussions with the first-team players about “navigating the situation the sport finds itself in,” as the delayed ISL prepares to restart after being paused for more than four months.Highlighting the challenges facing Indian football, Jindal took to X to explain the club’s position.""Everyone is well aware of the challenging phase Indian Football is going through. For me, as BFC team owner and someone who is deeply passionate about the sport and the club, this has been one of the toughest periods ever,"" Jindal wrote on 'X'.""I am grateful to all the first team players who have agreed to reduce their remuneration during this phase.""Without a doubt, this was one of the toughest decisions we have had to make as a club, and I truly appreciate that the players have made this sacrifice in the best interests of the club and the sport.""Jindal had earlier urged players across clubs to “make sacrifices” citing the “financial burden” franchises would face to participate in the delayed league, even warning that without player support his club might have to “shut shop for good.” While he had not detailed the nature of the sacrifice at the time, he hinted at salary reductions for the season.Bengaluru FC’s squad includes former India captain Sunil Chhetri and star goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu. The club has also appointed former India international Renedy Singh as first-team head coach for the upcoming campaign.Last month, FC Goa players, including India captain Sandesh Jhingan, along with support staff, also accepted pay cuts for the shortened season, with the club calling it a “selfless” move and saying it was “deeply humbled by this gesture and immensely grateful for the unity, character, and commitment shown by the group.” FC Goa’s roster also features India players Udanta Singh and Boris Singh.The ISL 2025–26 season was thrown into uncertainty after former organiser FSDL ended its Master Rights Agreement with the AIFF on December 8. Although a tender for a new commercial partner drew no bidders, intervention from the sports minister and negotiations ensured all 14 clubs confirmed participation. A truncated season featuring 91 matches will be played on a home-and-away basis, with each team contesting 13 games.The AIFF has since issued the Request for Proposal for broadcast rights, with bids set to open on February 2. Clubs will bear 60 per cent of the league’s financial cost, estimated at Rs 25 crore. Fixtures are expected to be announced soon.","Bengaluru FC players have agreed to take a pay cut for the truncated Indian Super League (ISL) season starting February 14.

Here's your guide to watch Super Bowl LX without cable

Super Bowl LX is almost here, and fans across the world are searching for one simple thing: how to watch the game live without paying for cable. The Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots will face off on Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026, at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. The game kicks off at 6:30 p.m. ET, with pregame coverage running throughout the day on NBC.Last season, FOX partnered with Tubi to stream Super Bowl LIX for free, but this season, NBC has not confirmed any free livestream for Super Bowl LX. That means most legal options now involve subscription services, free trials, or clever alternatives to watch the action at no direct cost. Here is how viewers in the U.S. and beyond can still tune in without traditional cable.NBC holds the U.S. broadcast rights, so the game will stream on Peacock, YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, FuboTV, DIRECTV Stream, and other platforms that carry NBC. Peacock will simulcast the full game, halftime show, and pregame coverage. However, only Peacock Premium or Premium Plus plans include live sports. The free Peacock tier will not stream the Super Bowl.One of the easiest ways to watch for free is through trial access. YouTube TV often offers a free trial to new users, which includes full access to NBC. If you cancel before the trial ends, you pay nothing. Hulu + Live TV, FuboTV, DIRECTV Stream, Instacart+, and Walmart+ also provide trial offers. Each service sets its own time limits, but when used correctly, they allow fans to stream the game legally without paying.Comcast subscribers with eligible 75 Mbps plans can add Peacock Premium through Xfinity NOW TV. Amazon Prime’s 7-day free trial also allows access to Peacock. These platforms stream in high definition and work across smart TVs, streaming devices, phones, tablets, and browsers.For fans who prefer to watch on the go, the NFL+ app offers live local and prime-time games, including the Super Bowl, on supported phones and tablets. It does not offer a free trial, but it remains one of the most affordable mobile options.In Canada, broadcast rights belong to CTV and TSN. Viewers can watch for free using a digital antenna if CTV is available in their area. DAZN also carries NFL content, though it is a paid service. Some markets may offer limited free broadcasts, while paid platforms such as Sky, Now, and DAZN offer full coverage.","The Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots will face off on Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026, at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California.

Trading his helmet for a golf cap, Kelce stepped into a very different arena and delivered one of the most memorable moments of the week. On Wednesday, the three-time Super Bowl champion competed in the pro-am at the WM Phoenix Open, where his appearance quickly became a fan favorite.Kelce teed it up at TPC Scottsdale, a course known as much for its energy as its design. From the opening holes, Kelce looked at ease, laughing with fans and leaning into the atmosphere. What is often a relaxed celebrity outing soon turned into something louder and far more memorable.The defining scene unfolded on the par-3 16th hole, widely known as the loudest hole in golf. Kelce’s tee shot came close to perfection, landing just a few feet from the hole and narrowly missing a hole-in-one. The packed grandstands erupted instantly, transforming a single swing into a full-blown spectacle.Kelce embraced the moment without hesitation. He was handed the WM Phoenix Open’s signature gold chain and proudly slipped it on as cheers echoed around the stadium-style hole.Moments later, he grabbed his putter and pretended it was a guitar, strumming it confidently while soaking in the reaction. Golf Week later highlighted the celebration as one of the most entertaining moments of the pro-am.The broadcast added another layer to the viral clip. Golf Channel’s Eamon Lynch summed up the crossover appeal perfectly when he quipped, “I think Taylor Swift is going to write a song about that one.”Kelce and Taylor Swift announced their engagement in August 2025, and interest in Kelce’s off-field appearances has only grown since then. Any lighthearted moment now attracts added attention, especially when it blends sport, humor, and celebrity.Golf has long been part of Kelce’s offseason routine. He frequently plays during breaks from the NFL calendar and enjoys competing in high-profile events. Last year, he and his brother Jason Kelce played together at the American Century Championship at Edgewood Tahoe Resort.While Kelce may not be preparing for another Super Bowl appearance this weekend, moments like this show his star power remains undeniable, no matter the stage.",Travis Kelce played in the pro-am at the WM Phoenix Open on Wednesday.

Is Cam Heyward retiring? Pittsburgh Steelers’ captain sent mixed signals on his future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-cam-heyward-retiring-pittsburgh-steelers-captain-sent-mixed-signals-on-his-future/articleshow/127922595.cms,"Is Cam Heyward retiring?

Cam Heyward on pausing after the season and why he won’t commit yet

Cam Heyward’s tenure in the NFL is no longer certain. After spending his 15th season with the Pittsburgh Steelers, the veteran DT openly admitted he has not decided whether to return for the next season. His latest remarks have sparked fresh chatter about whether retirement could be near.Heyward’s body of work and leadership remain unquestioned. But his candid remarks about needing time to disconnect and prioritize family moments have fuelled uncertainty around what comes next in his career.Heyward spoke about his future on The Rich Eisen Show when asked if he would return for another season.“I’m working on that,” he said. “It’s more just about where I’m at, and kind of decompressing after the season. That whole week of my tea and everything, it threw me for the biggest loop. My mom and my brothers, they were all checking on me, like, I just need to shut up right now. I don’t need to say much. Even on the pod, I was like, I can’t talk about this stuff because I’m not ready to.”When asked about what decompressing looks like, the Steelers captain shared a personal side.“First, I go back to dad mode,” Heyward said. “Like, I get to take my kids to school, or at least walk them to the bus stop because they don’t want me to drive them to school.They get embarrassed by me already. I get to be a dad, and I get to be a husband.”Heyward’s decision comes after a tad daunting season. Pittsburgh made the playoffs but lost in the Wild Card round. His role as captain has clearly weighed on him. While detailed 2025 individual stats vary by source and grading metrics, Pro Football Focus listed Heyward among the highest-graded interior defensive players in the league, reflecting a significant impact on the field.Contractually, Heyward remains signed with the Steelers through the 2026 season. According to Over The Cap, his cap charge for 2026 is approximately $19.15 million under his contract extension. That means if he chooses to play, he still carries significant value and role for Pittsburgh.There is also a notable change in the Steelers organisation this offseason. Veteran HC Mike Tomlin’s departure after 19 seasons has ushered in a new era in the Steelers, and that context hangs over each veteran’s decision about the future.Even as his playing future remains undecided, Heyward is already preparing for a life beyond the field in some ways. NBC Sports alluded that he will join as a guest analyst on its Super Bowl LX Pregame Show this Sunday, alongside Aaron Donald, Kyle Shanahan and Fred Warner.So, now he has made it clear he is in no rush to return without the right mindset and balance. His next move will come only after that reflection.",Pittsburgh Steelers’ captain sent mixed signals on his future. Heyward’s body of work and leadership remain unquestioned.

Patriots Super Bowl LX injury update: Drake Maye’s full practice on Wednesday brings hope ahead of the game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patriots-super-bowl-lx-injury-update-drake-mayes-full-practice-on-wednesday-brings-hope-ahead-of-the-game/articleshow/127922108.cms,"Drake Maye (Image via: IG/X)

Drake Maye’s practice return settles early questions at quarterback ahead of Super Bowl LX



The New England Patriots received welcome clarity at the most important time of the season as quarterback Drake Maye returned to full participation in Wednesday’s practice. The development came after a brief scare late last week when Maye missed Friday’s session due to an illness and a right shoulder issue. With Super Bowl LX now just days away, the Patriots needed reassurance at the game’s most important position, and Maye’s presence delivered exactly that.The rookie quarterback looked comfortable taking snaps and moving through the full workload during the team’s first official practice of the week. His status had been closely monitored since the weekend, but Wednesday’s update strongly suggests he is on track to start in Super Bowl LX on Sunday. For a Patriots offense built around rhythm and timing, Maye’s health provides stability as the team fine tunes its game plan on the biggest stage.While the offense received good news, the defensive side of the ball presented a more mixed picture. Linebacker Robert Spillane was listed as a non participant on Wednesday as he continues to recover from an ankle injury suffered in last Sunday’s AFC Championship Game win over the Denver Broncos.Spillane was spotted testing the ankle on the sideline during that game but was unable to return.Despite missing practice, Spillane has said he is trending toward playing in Super Bowl LX. His leadership and physical presence have been central to the Patriots’ defensive success throughout the postseason, making his availability a key storyline to monitor over the next few days.Linebacker Harold Landry III was limited with a knee injury that has lingered since Week 6. Like Spillane, Landry has remained optimistic about suiting up Sunday. On the positive side, defensive tackle Joshua Farmer returned to full participation after dealing with a hamstring issue, while offensive tackle Thayer Munford Jr. remained limited with a knee concern.As preparations continue, the Patriots appear encouraged by Maye’s progress and cautiously hopeful that their defense will be close to full strength when Super Bowl LX kicks off.",New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye returned to full participation in Wednesday's practice.

"""I love you coach”: Jason Kelce leads emotional tribute as Jeff Stoutland exits Eagles staff",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/i-love-you-coach-jason-kelce-leads-emotional-tribute-as-jeff-stoutland-exits-eagles-staff/articleshow/127921853.cms,"Jason Kelce leads emotional tribute as Jeff Stoutland exits Eagles staff(Image via Getty)



Jason Kelce's tribute shows Jeff Stoutland’s positive impact on the Philadelphia Eagles

Change arrived quietly in Philadelphia on Wednesday, without a press conference or a farewell tour to mark the moment. The Eagles confirmed that longtime offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland had stepped away from Nick Sirianni’s staff after 13 seasons with the franchise, bringing an end to one of the most stable coaching tenures in team history.The decision closed a chapter that stretched across multiple eras, from the Chip Kelly rebuild to the Super Bowl-winning roster and the consistent playoff runs that followed. While the organisation kept its statement brief, the emotional weight of the move became clear when former star center Jason Kelce shared a heartfelt message that captured what Stoutland meant to the locker room.The news broke on Wednesday when team insiders confirmed that Stoutland had chosen to leave the Eagles on his own terms. The organization later released a statement thanking him for his “legendary contributions” to football at both the college and professional levels, while wishing him the best in whatever comes next.Just hours later, Kelce reacted from Philadelphia with a post on X that quickly resonated across the league. He spoke as a player shaped by Stoutland’s demanding standards and steady presence.“There is absolutely no one I credit more with the career I had than Jeff Stoutland,” Kelce wrote on X on Feb 4.“The consistent passion and his eagerness to teach pushed my teammates, me, and our room to amazing success.”Kelce went on to explain that Stoutland’s value extended far beyond game plans and drills. “It was more than just coaching and teaching, it was his presence and sense of urgency that was unaccepting of mediocrity and potential left behind,” he added. “He will undoubtedly be missed inside the building and by everyone who played for him. I am incredibly grateful to have played for Stout, one of the best coaches and person. I love you, coach.”Stoutland joined the Eagles in 2013 and became the last remaining link to the Chip Kelly era. Over 13 seasons, Philadelphia reached the playoffs nine times, won two Super Bowls, and built a reputation for having one of the league’s most dominant offensive lines. Several players under his guidance earned All-Pro honours, while others went on to long and successful NFL careers.Philly hired Sean Mannion as offensive coordinator on Jan. 29, 2026. Reporter Chase Senior later noted that some candidates were hesitant to join the staff because of Stoutland’s extensive influence over both the offensive line and the run game, making his departure even more significant.Per Zach Berman of The Athletic, the Philly would have welcomed Stoutland in an unofficial role had he chosen to stay. NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo added that other teams have already expressed interest.For now, his legacy remains deeply rooted in Philadelphia. The coach may be stepping away, but the culture he built still defines the Eagles, and Kelce’s words made sure that will not be forgotten.","Philadelphia Eagles confirmed that offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland has left the team. Stoutland spent 13 seasons with the Eagles, winning two Super Bowls. Jason Kelce led an emotional tribute to Stoutland on X on Wednesday.

Rob Gronkowski blasts Bill Belichick's Hall of Fame snub and questions future voting logic



Bill Belichick, 6-time Super Bowl champion was not inducted into the Hall of Fame and like many, Patriots legend Rob Gronkowski is not happy. The former Patriots star did not mince words while addressing why his longtime coach and team owner were left out of the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2026. The news landed hard across the NFL, raising serious questions about how legacy, timing, and voting standards now shape football’s highest honor.Bill Belichick, a coach with decades of dominance, did not earn first-ballot induction. Robert Kraft, the owner behind one of the league’s most successful eras, was also excluded. For Gronkowski, the decision was not just surprising. It crossed into the absurd and reopened debates about how greatness is measured.Speaking to Front Office Sports on Radio Row, Gronkowski framed the moment as a turning point for Hall of Fame history.“Coach Belichick needs to be in the Hall of Fame, and it needed to be a first ballot,” Gronkowski told Front Office Sports on Radio Row at Super Bowl LX. “Now there’s no such thing as a first ballot Hall of Fame coach. No other coach ever in history should go first ballot.”The timing matters. Belichick’s résumé is already closed, his influence unquestioned.Yet the delay, in Gronkowski’s view, quietly resets expectations for every elite coach still active. He even pointed to Kansas City’s Andy Reid as collateral damage of the decision.“There’s a guy out there, Andy Reid, but he can’t go first ballot now because Coach Belichick wasn’t first ballot,” he said.Gronkowski extended that same urgency to Kraft, arguing the owner’s impact stretches well beyond New England’s trophy case.“Should already be in the Hall of Fame. What this guy has done—winningest franchise in history, his 10th Super Bowl now, going to the Super Bowl this year. He went to a Super Bowl before the Belichick-Brady era, as well.”To Gronkowski, Kraft’s role in shaping modern football economics matters just as much as wins.“What he has done, not just for the New England Patriots, but for football as a whole with all the TV contracts and everything—both of them should be in the Hall of Fame.”History shows first-ballot snubs are not new, even for legends. Still, Belichick’s absence feels different. It forces voters, fans, and future candidates to confront whether standards are evolving or drifting. That question now hangs over the Hall itself.",Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft were left out of the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2026.

Tom Brady's Super Bowl LX comments ignite Patriots backlash



Tom Brady's comments regarding Super Bowl LX, sparked a loud reaction this week, not because of what he said, but because of what many felt he failed to say. The former New England Patriots icon drew heat after publicly distancing himself from choosing a side in the Super Bowl matchup between the Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks. For a fan base that still treats Brady as family, neutrality felt personal.The remarks landed during a moment heavy with history. This is New England’s first Super Bowl appearance since 2018, and Brady’s legacy still defines the franchise. While Brady framed his stance as harmless objectivity, the response revealed how emotional the bond remains between a city and the quarterback who delivered six Lombardi Trophies.The controversy began on Monday’s episode of Brady’s “Let’s Go” podcast when he said, “I don’t have a dog in the fight in this one. May the best team win.” The line was meant to sound diplomatic. Instead, it struck a nerve in New England, where loyalty is remembered and measured.Bill Simmons, a lifelong Patriots supporter, summed up the frustration in a pointed Instagram video. “I tried not to take it personally when Tom Brady said he didn’t have a dog in this race for the Super Bowl between the Patriots and the Seahawks, even though he played for the Patriots for 20 years, won six Super Bowls for the Patriots,” Simmons said.“There’s a statue of Tom Brady outside the stadium where the Patriots play. Seems relevant…guess he doesn’t remember that.”Simmons stressed that fans stood by Brady through every chapter, including the Deflategate scandal and his departure to Tampa Bay. “It’s like he’s gone out of his way to make it seem like he just passed through (New England) for two decades,” Simmons continued. “And the danger of this, is that for Patriots fans…he’s at risk of that getting a little frosty.”Former teammates echoed that sentiment. Rob Gronkowski joked on Up and Adams that Brady likely wished he were playing instead of watching. Vince Wilfork was more blunt at Super Bowl LX Radio Row. “At the end of the day, if you’re a Patriot for life, you know what it is. Don’t give me that political bull crap, that’s just what it is. If you don’t think we’re gonna win, just pick Seattle then. Don’t straddle the fence,” Wilfork said to WEEI.Asante Samuel also voiced disappointment, pointing out Brady’s silence toward current Patriots coach Mike Vrabel. Now a minority owner of the Raiders, Brady may see himself as neutral ground. For those who once worshiped him, that distance feels colder than intended.","Tom Brady drew criticism for saying he doesn't have a ""dog in the fight"" in the Super Bowl.

TreVeyon Henderson's marriage became public four days before Super Bowl LX, adding a deeply personal layer to New England’s title run. The Patriots are preparing to face the Seattle Seahawks in their first Super Bowl appearance since the 2018 season, and the timing of Henderson’s revelation has drawn quiet attention across the league. While the spotlight often follows quarterbacks, this moment belonged to a rookie running back who chose honesty over hype.New England’s rise has been fueled by balance and belief. Behind quarterback Drake Maye and Henderson, the Patriots have built a backfield that thrives under pressure. As the team settles into final preparations, Henderson’s off-field milestone offered a glimpse into the calm that often defines players at their best, especially before the biggest game of their careers.Henderson revealed his marriage during a February 2 appearance on the Christian athlete podcast The Walk, choosing a reflective setting rather than a press conference. The 23-year-old did not share his wife’s name, keeping that part of his life protected. What he did share was clear and intentional.“Well, I just broke the news. Yeah, we got married,” Henderson said with a smile.He added, “We made it official. We got engaged first, and then we eloped and made it official, man.”The decision came after a relationship that has lasted nearly three years, one that began through TikTok and grew alongside his personal growth. Henderson spoke openly on the podcast about searching for commitment while trying to turn his life around, explaining how faith and focus reshaped his priorities. Married life, he said later in the episode, has been “great,” while noting he has been “growing as a husband” and “learning the beauty of marriage. ”The engagement first became public in September, when Henderson shared a photo with his then-fiancée standing among red rose petals and illuminated “MARRY ME” letters. His caption read, “‘Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing, But a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised.’ ‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭31‬:‭30‬ ‭💍”.Now in his rookie season after being selected in the second round of the 2025 NFL Draft, Henderson enters Super Bowl Sunday grounded rather than distracted. The Seahawks arrive as slight favorites, but New England’s confidence rests on preparation and poise. If Henderson reaches the end zone at Levi’s Stadium, one ring will already be secure, long before the final whistle.",TreVeyon Henderson revealed his marriage four days before Super Bowl LX.

The Waste Management Phoenix Open delivered its signature blend of elite golf and festival energy on Wednesday, and the Annexus Pro-Am added an unexpected spark. NFL superstar Travis Kelce joined the field, trading Super Bowl prep for fairways at TPC Scottsdale. Fans packed the course, music echoed across holes, and the pairing list turned into a headline of its own.Kelce, fresh off a season that ended short of February football, rotated through the back nine with Brooks Koepka after earlier teeing it up alongside Scottie Scheffler. The timing mattered. This tournament thrives on spectacle, and Kelce brought it. On the par-3 16th, he pulled off a shot that drew roars usually reserved for aces. It looked effortless, and it proved he belongs in this setting.The Waste Management Phoenix Open Pro-Am thrives on why and how. Why it works is simple. The crowd wants access, noise, and personalities. How it succeeds is pairing stars who feed off energy. Kelce did both. With Taylor Swift ’s music playing behind him, he leaned into the moment, smiling through cheers and soaking up a scene far removed from an NFL huddle.Koepka’s return to the PGA Tour after nearly four years away added weight to the day.His wife, Jena Sims, made sure none of it felt routine. Before tee time, she shared her outfit of the day on TikTok, a head-turning tank top that quickly drew attention. Once the Koepka-Kelce pairing became public, her reaction went viral. Sims gushed, “I’m obsessed with Taylor Swift’s fiancé even before Taylor was in the picture.” She called it “one of the best pairings,” her excitement bubbling as she planned to watch from the ropes.Kelce’s golf resume explains why the pairing worked. He owns a reported low handicap and has long been a fixture at celebrity events like the American Century Championship. His long drive wins there, including one in 2023, speak to raw power and coordination. If retirement ever comes, golf will not be a learning curve. It will be a second act.The Phoenix Open did what it always does. It blurred the line between sport and spectacle, and this year, Kelce and Sims made sure the buzz carried well beyond the desert.","NFL star Travis Kelce paired with Brooks Koepka at the Waste Management Phoenix Open.

Drake Maye opens up about cooking, marriage and Super Bowl motivation

Drake Maye does many things well, but cooking is not one of them. The New England Patriots quarterback addressed his kitchen skills during Super Bowl Opening Night, offering an honest and lighthearted take that quickly charmed fans. While his arm strength and poise under pressure define his public image, Maye made it clear that his confidence fades once the stove turns on.Speaking at the 2026 Super Bowl kickoff event at the San Jose Convention Center on Feb. 2, Drake Maye did not attempt to compete with his wife Ann Michael in the culinary department. Asked how he stacks up next to her, especially as her baking videos continue to go viral, Maye answered without hesitation or ego, setting the tone for a moment that felt genuine and unpolished.""I'm not great, not great at all,"" Drake Maye told PEOPLE of his culinary capabilities when speaking to a room full of media for the 2026 Super Bowl kickoff event held at the San Jose Convention Center on Monday, Feb. 2. He quickly redirected the praise to Ann Michael, calling her his kitchen MVP. ""I leave that up to my wife, she's a baller,"" he said, before adding, ""She's the best at it, and I love her for it.""Ann Michael, 22, Maye’s high school sweetheart, has built a strong following through baking tutorials, lifestyle clips and game day content.Her rise has gone beyond social media, earning her an NBC Sports Boston show, Beyond Bakemas, where she showcases her recipes. Some of those treats even make their way to the Patriots facility, though Maye makes sure he gets his share.When it comes to his own cooking, Maye kept expectations low. ""What I can do... I can do a little baking in the morning,"" he said with a laugh. ""Other than that, I can do a bacon egg and cheese... a bacon egg and cheese is about all I can do for breakfast — other than that, I can do a PB&J and a grilled cheese. That's about it.""Still, his appreciation for Ann Michael’s work is clear. In a recent NFL Instagram clip, Maye ranked her Cinnamon Roll Snickerdoodle as his top choice, saying, “Cinnamon Roll Snickerdoodle, she just made those for the linemen this week. That’s my number one.” Her Crumbl-style sugar cookies came in second, while Puppy Chow landed third. Even when a recipe misses his personal taste, like her Pistachio Bread, Maye stays supportive. “I think it’s good, I’m not a fan. I’ll put that at four,” he admitted.If the Patriots defeat the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl, Maye has no demands. ""Whatever she wants. Whatever she wants, she deserves it. She's been a part of the journey, so she wants. Whatever she wants to celebrate with.""","The New England Patriots quarterback addressed his kitchen skills during Super Bowl Opening Night.

Days before Super Bowl weekend, her name collided with NFL headlines after videos linked her to Stefon Diggs , who has been publicly connected to Cardi B The timing sent gossip pages into overdrive. Screenshots, reposts, and speculation spread fast. What began as whispers turned into a full online storm, pushing thousands to search one question: who exactly is Sky Marlene?Sky’s feed suggests control. She shares curated glimpses of villas, glam looks, and luxury travel. She rarely overshares. That restraint helped shape her mystique. But early 2025 rumors tied her to Diggs during a period when he was increasingly seen with Cardi B. By midyear, Diggs and Cardi B had gone public and later welcomed a child. Many assumed Sky’s name would fade from the narrative. Instead, it resurfaced.In February 3, Sky posted Instagram Stories that quickly circulated across X and sports gossip accounts.One clip showed her placing her feet on Diggs’ face while he scrolled through his phone in a car. Another featured her addressing speculation directly, claiming Diggs had been messaging her for years and asking people not to link her to anyone else. The boldness fueled reaction.“Feet on his face is crazy. Cardi that is not your man,” one user wrote. Another added, “They only get bold when a famous name is involved.” Comment sections filled with memes, accusations, and jokes about open relationships. Some criticized Diggs. Others questioned motives. A few praised Sky for confronting rumors head on.What separates her from typical viral figures is her response strategy. She posts screenshots. She answers critics. She denies being anyone’s secret. Whether it is transparency or calculated visibility, it keeps attention locked on her profile.Beyond the drama, Sky remains a lifestyle influencer. Yet her brand now carries a storyline tied to NFL headlines and hip hop circles. As Super Bowl buzz grows, so does interest in her role within it.","Sky Marlene, a luxury-focused Instagram influencer, went viral after videos linked her to NFL star Stefon Diggs ahead of Super Bowl weekend.

“She can break up with him”: Fans turn Travis Kelce’s Taylor Swift joke into full-blown relationship debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/she-can-break-up-with-him-fans-turn-travis-kelces-taylor-swift-joke-into-full-blown-relationship-debate/articleshow/127910581.cms,"Travis Kelce sparked online debate after joking “Taylor’s going to kill me” during a podcast mishap. While many fans saw it as harmless humor, others turned the repeated comment into wild theories about his relationship with Taylor Swift. Social media reactions ranged from playful teasing to harsh criticism, especially amid recent scrutiny surrounding their engagement and Kelce’s uncertain NFL future.

Travis Kelce’s repeated Taylor Swift joke sparks wild fan theories online

Travis Kelce meant to make people laugh. Instead, he sparked a wave of online theories that pulled Taylor Swift straight into the center of debate. During a teaser for the February 3 episode of the “New Heights” podcast, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end leaned too far back in his chair while laughing and fell to the floor. Red-faced and grinning, he quipped, “Taylor’s going to kill me.” Within hours, the clip spread across social media.For many fans, it was classic Kelce humor. But others began dissecting the repeated joke, especially since this was not the first time he used the same phrase. What started as a light moment quickly turned into speculation about Swift’s personality and their relationship dynamic.Two weeks earlier, Kelce made a similar remark after missing a reference to Swift’s music. When a fan suggested a merchandise pun tied to her lyrics, he admitted, “I didn’t understand that. Taylor’s gonna kill me for not knowing that.” The playful self-deprecation seemed harmless. Still, some viewers chose to read deeper into it.On X, reactions ranged from teasing to sharp criticism. One user wrote, “She can break up with him over this, and that's not even a joke.” Another claimed, “Yeah, you can already tell from his reaction that she’s the type who gets annoyed with things, but he likes it, right?”Others piled on with exaggerated humor. “The poor thing is going to be left without two chairs because the second one’s going to break on his head,” one post read.A harsher comment added, “This dude is either a doormat or has no idea what he's signing up for, because Trailer Swift is the queen of spin. Heaven help him.”The timing adds fuel. Kelce and Swift, engaged since August 2025, have faced scrutiny after a tough Chiefs season and questions about his NFL future. In today’s social media culture, even a throwaway line can spiral. For now, though, it appears to be nothing more than a running joke that the internet refuses to leave alone.","Travis Kelce's repeated joke about Taylor Swift sparks wild fan theories.

Some players questioned his fit with football culture or admitted they were unfamiliar with his music. Others praised the choice, highlighting diversity and global appeal. While opinions vary, many acknowledge his massive streaming success and potential to boost ratings.

Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime gig divides NFL players ahead of big game

Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime selection has stirred debate far beyond social media. Now, anonymous NFL players are weighing in. The Puerto Rican global superstar will become the first Spanish language artist to headline the halftime show, and reactions inside locker rooms appear just as divided as those online. While some players admit they are unfamiliar with his music, others see the choice as a reflection of the league’s evolving audience.The controversy gained political attention after criticism surfaced in conservative media circles. Still, NFL leadership has stood firm. Among players surveyed, opinions range from confusion to excitement. For some, the issue is cultural. For others, it simply comes down to taste in music.Bad Bunny’s selection as the Super Bowl halftime performer has sparked expected debate, and a new poll from The Athletic reveals that NFL players are divided on the choice. While some welcome the global star’s historic appearance, others remain unconvinced, showing that enthusiasm inside locker rooms is far from unanimous.One NFC offensive player admitted, “I don’t even know who Bad Bunny is. I always think it should be an American.I think they’re trying too hard with this international stuff.” Another added, “I do not like it. (I’d prefer) anyone who’s synonymous with football and football culture. I feel like there’s tons of artists out there who are fans of the game.”Others welcomed the diversity. “I’ve heard his music obviously, but I don’t speak Spanish so I’m not a big fan,” said one NFC defensive player. “But I do think it’s cool to have him, because America is based on diversity. America was built on immigration. So I feel like having him just furthers that American dream. I like it. I like the choice.” Another player kept it simple: “I love the culture behind it.”Some players looked at the bigger picture. “I don’t know who (Bad Bunny) is and never listened to his music. But I saw on the year-end data he’s the global leader in music streams; it makes sense wanting to make this a global performance. Good for ratings.”Enthusiasm was also present. “I think it’s pretty awesome,” one player said. “Some of his music is really good, man. When I was training, I heard it in Florida. I heard his music all the time. And it’s a bop, man.” Another added, “Heck yeah. It's going to be a good time. The girls like Bad Bunny, so of course, we're going to like it.”Love him or question the choice, one thing is clear. The halftime stage remains one of the NFL’s most powerful cultural platforms.","Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime selection has divided NFL players, according to an anonymous league survey.

“Millionaires like you…”: Josh Allen’s wife Hailee Steinfeld accused of cash grab after unveiling new paid Beau Society tier,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/millionaires-like-you-josh-allens-wife-hailee-steinfeld-accused-of-cash-grab-after-unveiling-new-paid-beau-society-tier/articleshow/127909130.cms,"Hailee Steinfeld is facing backlash after introducing a paid tier to her Beau Society platform. The actress, married to Bills quarterback Josh Allen, says the move aims to create a more private, meaningful space for fans. However, many supporters criticized the subscription model, calling it unnecessary and exclusionary, while others defended her decision to expand the brand.

Hailee Steinfeld faces backlash over paid Beau Society membership launch

After turning her fan site, Beau Society, into a paid subscription service, Hailee Steinfeld is getting a lot of hate she didn't expect. The actress and wife of Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen started the community in 2024 to give people a more personal option to regular social media. It quickly became the place where she shared important personal events, like news about her pregnancy and wedding. Fans who used to praise how easy it was to get to now disagree with her decision to add a premium tier.The new membership level, called ""MORE BS,"" promises to give you more access through private voicemails, exclusive photos, and a small group chat for more personal interaction. The original weekly newsletter is still free, but the new paywall has split her audience. Some people think the move is a step toward privacy and honesty. Some people see it differently.Steinfeld recently expressed gratitude for the connection she has built through the platform. “Never in a million years did I expect that so many of you would read this letter and take the time to send a thoughtful reply about how it resonated with you,” she wrote. “But you have! Since the very beginning, it has felt like a two-way conversation, a growing community coming together, and we’re ready to take it a layer deeper.Still, criticism has been loud. One fan commented, “I think sometimes you create something, i.e., Beau, and it becomes relatable to so many people. While the need to expand seems enticing, a paid subscription is not something everyone can justify. I love the original Beau Society🩷.”Another wrote, “Pay for content is just wrong. Get real and understand that 99% of readers are not millionaires like you!!!” A more measured voice added, “I’m really happy that you are taking this step for Beau Society! I’m not currently in the position to join, but in the future I’d be really excited to!!” Meanwhile, another blunt remark read, “You have $80 million; you don’t need more.”The debate reflects a broader tension in celebrity culture. Fans crave closeness, but they also expect access without barriers. Whether Beau Society thrives or falters may depend on how Steinfeld balances exclusivity with the loyalty that built her brand.","Hailee Steinfeld is facing backlash after introducing a paid tier to her Beau Society platform.

Houston Rockets are likely to have Kevin Durant

Kevin Durant injury status for February 4 vs Celtics

How the injury happened

What his return means for Rockets vs Celtics

Fantasy and betting impact

Will Kevin Durant play tonight?

Theback in the lineup on Wednesday night when they face the Boston Celtics at Toyota Center. The veteran forward missed the previous game, but his status has improved quickly.His return matters for a matchup between two teams currently on winning streaks. Houston is trying to strengthen its position in the Western Conference standings, and having its leading scorer available could make a difference against one of the league’s top teams.Kevin Durant is listed as probable on the NBA’s official injury report for February 4 due to a left ankle sprain. Players with this tag usually play unless something changes close to tip-off.Head coach Ime Udoka said the injury is mild and called Durant’s absence earlier this week precautionary. Medical staff tracked his mobility and pain level during practice and shootaround before clearing him to return.Kevin Durant injured his left ankle in the third quarter of Houston’s 118-114 win over the Indiana Pacers on February 2. He stepped on an opponent’s foot while driving to the basket. Although he stayed in briefly, he was limping.The coaching staff decided to sit him for the rest of the game and hold him out the following night to avoid making the injury worse. Houston has taken a careful approach with the 37-year-old this season, limiting his workload in back-to-back situations and addressing minor injuries early to keep him healthy for the playoff race.Houston enters the game with a 31-17 record, placing the team fourth in the Western Conference and one win behind Denver for third. The Rockets have won three straight games, while Boston is also on a three-game winning streak.Durant has been Houston’s main scoring option, averaging about 28-30 points per game while shooting over 50 percent from the field. He remains the team’s go-to player late in games and gives Houston another shot creator against a strong Boston defense.Kevin Durant’s probable status makes him a safe choice for fantasy lineups. However, the Rockets could manage his minutes slightly as a precaution, especially with a game against Charlotte scheduled for the next night.If he plays, he is expected to handle a large share of the half-court offense, take more three-point shots against Boston’s switching defense, and remain heavily involved in key possessions. His minutes could still be monitored depending on how the game unfolds.Betting lines have already shifted following the update, with Houston’s implied win probability increasing after Durant was upgraded.Kevin Durant is expected to play against the Celtics. There are no signs of a setback, and the team appears comfortable with his recovery. Houston is continuing to manage his workload, but the expectation is that Durant will be on the court for a game that could affect the standings as the season moves forward.","Kevin Durant injured his left ankle in the third quarter of Houston’s 118-114 win over the Indiana Pacers on February 2.

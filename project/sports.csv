Poll Who do you think will win the IPL 2025 match between RCB and KKR? Kolkata Knight Riders Royal Challengers Bengaluru

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 returns on Saturday with a blockbuster showdown between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Kolkata Knight Riders at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium . But before the cricketing action kicks off, RCB ’s all-rounder Tim David grabbed the spotlight — and not for his batting.With heavy rain drenching the stadium, most players made a quick dash to shelter. Not Tim David. Clad in shorts and undeterred by the downpour, the Australian cricketer dove onto a water-logged cover, turning it into his own personal splash pool.His impromptu rain-swim had everyone in splits, and when he returned to the dressing room soaked and smiling, his teammates greeted him with a round of applause.David has been in top form this season. In 11 matches, he has racked up 186 runs, including a blistering unbeaten 50, averaging a staggering 93 and striking at 194 — making him one of RCB’s most dangerous finishers in IPL 2025.Gujarat Titans and Royal Challengers Bengaluru lead the table with 16 points each from 11 matches. Gujarat, however, sit atop thanks to their superior Net Run Rate (NRR) of +0.793, compared to RCB’s +0.482.Punjab Kings are right on their heels with 15 points, including one no-result, and an NRR of +0.376. Mumbai Indians, with 14 points from 12 matches and the best NRR so far at +1.156, also remain strong contenders.Delhi Capitals (13 points, +0.362 NRR) are still in the hunt, while Kolkata Knight Riders (11 points from 12 games, +0.193 NRR) need wins and a bit of luck. Lucknow Super Giants (10 points, -0.469 NRR) face a steep climb to break into the top four.Sunrisers Hyderabad, Rajasthan Royals, and Chennai Super Kings have been knocked out of playoff contention, with poor NRRs sealing their fate.","The IPL 2025 returns on Saturday with a blockbuster showdown between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Kolkata Knight Riders.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on IPL, India-Australia rivalry | Part 1

NEW DELHI: Gujarat Titans currently sit atop the IPL 2025 points table and are training at full intensity ahead of their upcoming clash against Delhi Capitals on Sunday at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi. With 16 points from 11 matches, the Titans are well-positioned to secure a top-two finish in the league stage. Their remaining fixtures include matches against Delhi Capitals (away, May 18), Lucknow Super Giants (May 22), and Chennai Super Kings (May 25).As part of their preparations, head coach Ashish Nehra actively participated in the team’s fielding drills. Renowned for his sharp one-liners and playful personality, Nehra once again stole the spotlight during the session.With the tournament entering its business end, Gujarat Titans are leaving no stone unturned in their pursuit of playoff dominance — and with Nehra keeping the atmosphere light yet focused, the team appears to be in fine balance both mentally and tactically.“Bahot badhiya darling... Chhaa gaya miyaan aaj... Ek aur lele aaja... Base bana le, base bana le,” Nehra was heard saying in his trademark style, drawing laughter from players and support staff alike.The former India pacer led the fielding session with full commitment, working closely with several players, including all-rounder Shahrukh Khan.With the league stage of IPL 2025 entering its final stretch, the battle for playoff spots has intensified. Gujarat Titans and Royal Challengers Bengaluru currently sit at the top of the table, both with 16 points from 11 matches.Gujarat Titans lead the standings, thanks to a superior Net Run Rate (NRR) of +0.793, while RCB follows closely with an NRR of +0.482.Punjab Kings are hot on their heels with 15 points from 11 games, including one no-result. Their NRR of +0.376 keeps them in strong contention for a top-two finish. Mumbai Indians, despite having played one game more (12 matches), are also in the mix with 14 points and a healthy NRR of +1.156—the best among all teams so far.Delhi Capitals are placed fifth with 13 points from 11 matches. With one no-result and an NRR of +0.362, they are very much in the playoff hunt and could climb further up the table with strong finishes in their remaining games.Kolkata Knight Riders are hanging on to playoff hopes with 11 points from 12 matches. Their NRR of +0.193 may come into play if multiple teams finish with similar points. Lucknow Super Giants, at 10 points from 11 matches and an NRR of -0.469, face an uphill task to break into the top four.Sunrisers Hyderabad, Rajasthan Royals, and Chennai Super Kings have all been eliminated from the playoff race. SRH have 7 points with a poor NRR of -1.192, while RR and CSK share 6 points each but lag behind on NRR, at -0.718 and -0.992 respectively.With only a handful of games remaining, the margins are razor-thin, and every run could decide who makes it to the IPL 2025 playoffs.",Gujarat Titans currently sit atop the IPL 2025 points table with 16 points from 11 matches.

Poll Do you think Shubman Gill is the right choice for India's Test captaincy? No, we need someone with more experience. Yes, he has proven leadership skills.

MUMBAI: Shubman Gill ’s coronation as India’s new Test captain appears imminent. TOI has learnt that the 25-year-old Punjab batsman, currently leading the Gujarat Titans in the IPL, will most likely be named skipper when the national selectors announce the squad for the upcoming tour of England, which includes a gruelling five-Test series.Ever since Rohit Sharma announced his retirement from Test cricket on May 7, Gill, who served as Rohit’s deputy during India’s victorious 2025 Champions Trophy campaign, has been the frontrunner to take over the reins.A couple of recent developments strongly indicate that the ‘Gill captaincy era’ is about to begin in Indian cricket. During the IPL 2025 season (before it was paused), when the Gujarat Titans were in Delhi to play the Delhi Capitals, Gill visited India head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s residence for lunch. The two reportedly spoke for four to five hours.Later, after GT’s match against the Mumbai Indians at Wankhede Stadium on May 6, India’s chief selector Ajit Agarkar also had a discussion with Gill.According to a BCCI source, the selection committee is planning a long-term captaincy transition, and Gill is seen as the ideal candidate. “He has shown impressive leadership qualities in the way he has led GT, who are currently topping the table this season,” the source said. With a new World Test Championship cycle (2025–27) on the horizon, the selectors are keen to give Gill an extended run as captain, intending to build a young team around him.This is also why he was appointed vice-captain for the 2025 Champions Trophy. Gill has featured both as an opener and at No. 3 in Test cricket.In 32 matches, he has scored 1,893 runs at an average of 35.05, including five centuries and seven fifties. As for Jasprit Bumrah, who has previously captained India in Tests, notably during the win at Perth, he is unlikely to be considered for the role due to workload concerns. Meanwhile, it has been learnt that Gambhir will depart for England on June 6, ahead of the rest of the squad. “He wants to observe a few India A players who will be in action against the England Lions,” said a BCCI official.",Shubman Gill is expected to be named India's new Test captain.

RAIN PAIN

Bengaluru: The break in the IPL this season seems to have worked in Rajat Patidar ’s favour. The Royal Challengers Bengaluru captain, who suffered a right ring finger injury against Chennai Super Kings in a home game on May 3, got some time to recover for the remainder of the season, which resumes here on Saturday. With his availability a talking point ahead of RCB’s match against Kolkata Knight Riders here, the stylish right-hander made a statement on match eve on Thursday.On Thursday, Virat Kohli and Phil Salt were the first batters to start proceedings in the team’s first full training session after the break. As the opening duo showcased their range of shots, Patidar focused on basic fitness routines near the boundary line.The 31-year-old played shadow shots before heading towards the nets. To begin with, Patidar, who strapped his finger, took some low throwdowns. It was evident that the player was trying to test his finger, which was taped. Once Patidar felt comfortable, he walked towards the main nets and got down to business.Initially, he lacked power in his shots, even miscuing a few. Patidar, who was watched closely by batting coach and mentor Dinesh Karthik , pushed a few balls to either side of the wicket before unleashing his big hits. Most of it landed in the stands, with his timing being a standout feature. With every shot, Patidar grew in confidence and brought out his trademark aerial cover drives. While Patidar’s show during training is a huge relief for the team, it also strengthens the Madhya Pradesh player’s case for the England tour. Proving his match fitness will be crucial with an India A squad call-up in the pipeline.While focus was on Patidar’s fitness, others got their time in the middle, including Karnataka’s Mayank Agarwal, who is Devdutt Padikkal’s injury replacement. The bowling unit, led by Krunal Pandya and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, went through the grind. The latter has a huge role to play for the in-form franchise, with Josh Hazlewood’s availability in question and South Africa pacer Lungi Ngidi set to miss the Playoffs.The KKR squad, barring Rovman Powell and Moeen Ali, too got down to business. Confirming the duo’s absence, the franchise stated, “Powell and Ali couldn’t come back due to medical reasons. Rovman is undergoing a procedure, while Moeen and his family are down with a viral infection.”Saturday’s clash – with rain threat looming – is a big game for the visitors, who lie in sixth place and a defeat will make matters difficult for them in the Playoff race. On the other hand, RCB, who lie second with 16 points from 11 games, have all but sealed their berth.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru face Kolkata Knight Riders on Saturday.

Poll Should the ICC establish a specific qualification pathway for Caribbean nations in cricket for the 2028 Olympics? Unsure, need more information No, it should be based on world rankings Yes, it's essential for fairness

Cricket West Indies has appealed to the International Cricket Council to establish a qualification pathway for Caribbean nations to compete in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, where cricket will return after a 128-year absence with a six-team T20 tournament for both men and women.The qualification process for the LA Olympics remains unannounced by the ICC, raising concerns for West Indies cricket.The issue stems from the unique structure of West Indies cricket, where nations like Barbados, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, and Trinidad and Tobago compete as a unified team in international cricket but participate separately in the Olympics.This structure could potentially exclude Caribbean involvement if Olympic qualification is determined by world rankings alone.""All we are asking is that our individual nations' exceptional Olympic legacy be considered in the conversation,"" said CWI chief executive Chris Dehring. ""Our nations have proudly flown their individual flags atop Olympic podiums as perennial gold medallists. Now, with cricket's inclusion, we must ensure that our cricketers are not shut out of history. We are ready to collaborate. We are ready to compete. But above all, we are asking for fairness.""CWI acknowledges that fielding a unified West Indies team at LA 2028 is unlikely, despite their past successes as T20 world champions in 2012 and 2016, with their women's team also securing the global title in 2016.In their letter to the ICC, CWI proposed two potential solutions for regional representation.The first proposal suggests an inter-Caribbean qualifying tournament if the West Indies teams secure a qualifying position.The second proposal recommends a dedicated regional qualifying process for all independent West Indies nations.""The Caribbean has always punched above its weight at the Olympics, inspiring the world with our athletic brilliance,"" said CWI president Kishore Shallow. ""Cricket's return to the Games in 2028 must not exclude our young cricketers from the same dream that has inspired our athletes.""","Cricket West Indies have appealed to the International Cricket Council to establish a qualification pathway for Caribbean nations to compete in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

""Marks are merely numbers on a sheet – true value lies in perseverance and dedication.""

As the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) declared the Class 10 and 12 results for 2025 earlier this week, an old academic document of cricket icon Virat Kohli re-emerged on social media his Class 10 CBSE marksheet.The document, which was originally shared by IAS officer Jitin Yadav on August 9, 2023, went viral again as millions of students across India viewed their results. With over 42 lakh students receiving their marks this year, including a 96.3% pass rate in Class 10, Kohli’s modest school scores provided a timely reminder that academic performance isn’t the only path to greatness.The marksheet reveals Kohli scored 83 in English (A1 grade) and 81 in Social Science (A2), with a B1 in Hindi. His scores in Science and Introductory IT — C1 and C2 respectively reflected a more average academic profile.In his original post, Yadav wrote:The sentiment resonated widely. As one user aptly commented,Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Kohli, who recently retired from Test cricket after a 14-year run that saw him amass 9230 runs in 123 matches, continues to inspire not only through his sporting achievements but through his journey from a Delhi schoolboy to a global cricketing icon.With CBSE now adopting a 'Relative Grading' system to reduce stress and over-competition among students, Kohli's resurfacing marksheet serves as a powerful example that one’s career and character are not defined by early report cards but by what comes after.","Virat Kohli's Class 10 CBSE marksheet re-emerges on social media.

This time we were winning one, but were losing one. The whole tournament was like that. Our batting has been fine. We have been bowling really well. It has been a year where it has been a little patchy in terms of both the performances, batting and bowling. Hopefully, we will have a similar strong core for next year as well and can win games like we were doing last year,"" he explained.The unexpected break, according to Pandey, could prove beneficial for the team's remaining matches.""But a break like this could definitely help. I am pretty sure guys would have gone back home and seen their videos and tried to work on a few things that they didn't have the opportunity to do. So, I think it should be a good break.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

Virat Kohli was always a VIBE during India's practice sessions

Royal Challengers Bengaluru 's team director Mo Bobat confirmed on Friday in Bengaluru that Virat Kohli remains focused and competitive in IPL 2024 despite his recent retirement from Test cricket, where he amassed 9230 runs from 123 Tests with 30 centuries.Bobat addressed Kohli's approach to the current IPL season during a pre-match press conference, emphasizing the player's dedication to RCB's success.""The first thing to say is Virat's business as usual, as he always is. There's enough of the public and the nation's attention on him, and he doesn't want any more of that. He's ambitious about what we can achieve this year with RCB and that's what he does,"" Bobat said.The team director expressed admiration for Kohli's Test career achievements and his impact on Indian cricket.""He should be incredibly proud of what he's done as a Test player for India. RCB as a franchise, we are all incredibly proud of what every one of our players does for India, but in particular him. To play 120 plus Test matches and to score nearly 10,000 runs is no mean feat. Also as a captain, his record, 60 per cent win percentage or something like that as captain, again, no mean feat,"" he stated.Bobat shared his previous experience with Kohli from his time in the England coaching setup in 2018.""I can also talk from my previous role as an Englishman working in the English system. He was someone you never wanted to play against, he was always the batter you wanted to get out. You knew that if he was either in the pavilion to come or at the crease, you were in trouble,"" he recalled.The team director highlighted Kohli's memorable performance in the 2018 England series, where he scored 593 runs in five Tests at an average close to 60.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? ""Some of my most fondest memories watching Test cricket involve him. I'll never forget the 2018 series in England, the Test at Edgbaston, watching Jimmy Anderson and him do battle like two gladiators. Jimmy must have bowled nine overs on the try. There were two of the best players in the world doing their things. That's what he's about, he's about those special moments, those inspiring moments,"" Bobat reminisced.He expressed confidence in the continued support from fans at Chinnaswamy stadium.""I'm sure the fans will show him lots of love this week when they see him again. Just to go back to where I started, he's business as usual, we all are. He's spoken to a few of us about things in the last few weeks, but you know what he's like, he's pretty clear on what he wants to do,"" he added.Regarding social media calls for fans to wear white jerseys in honor of Kohli's Test career, Bobat maintained that such gestures would not significantly impact their game.""It's not something we've thought about or talked about too much. I've certainly noticed that the fans have been talking about that a little bit, but I don't think it'll have much of an impact on our play,"" he concluded.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru's team director Mo Bobat confirmed on Friday that Virat Kohli remains focused and competitive in IPL 2024.

Those are the standards we have set. Crystal Palace are a really difficult club to play against.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has faced criticism from the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) after an almost two-hour delay to the 75th FIFA Congress in Paraguay due to his meeting with former U.S. President Donald Trump , officials say.

The delay disrupted the tightly choreographed event and was met with outright condemnation from UEFA's leadership, The Athletic reports.In a refreshingly blunt remark, UEFA denounced the 'last-minute timetable alterations' as not only inconvenient but 'deeply regrettable'. The body also accused Gianni Infantino of prioritizing 'private political interests' over his responsibilities to international football. This response is at a very sensitive moment, with FIFA currently in talks regarding hosting rights for the 2034 FIFA World Cup , a process during which Saudi Arabia remains a favoriteWhile Infantino's justification was that flight problems were the culprit, UEFA representatives remained skeptical, particularly considering the visuals of his relationship with Donald Trump during a time of major policy-making in world soccer.UEFA and FIFA have had a growingly awkward relationship in recent years, with disagreements over formats of tournaments, models of revenue, and expansion plans globally.

How Salah built his fortune beyond football

Inside Salah's personal life and unique home setup

Since signing a new deal at Liverpool, Mohamed Salah has only become more valued in the football world, with his wealth increasing as well. Mohamed Salah's wealth is valued at about $90 million (£68 million) due to his strong performance on the field and different revenue sources. He has made this amount of money mostly from his lengthy playing contract, which was just extended for another two years. This extension shuts down all talk of his departure from the team that went around on social media.His earnings from Liverpool are only one part of the income he earns each year. Endorsement deals with Adidas, Pepsi, Vodafone, and Audi have added immensely to Salah’s yearly income. According to experts, Mohamed Salah might be bringing in an extra £1 million every week from his image rights and commercial deals. Building up his financial empire relied heavily on diversified profits, thanks in large part to his strong marketing presence in the Middle East and Africa.Mohamed Salah spends most of his time away from the public eye with his wife, Magi, and their two daughters, Makka and Kayan. Magi spends most of her time away from the public and social media, but she does visit Anfield to see matches now and then.In an interview with France Football, Mohamed Salah discussed how his house, in a way, feels like a ""hospital"" because of all the equipment he has. Mohamed Salah went on to say that there are two rooms in his house that are just for his fitness machines and bodybuilding. In addition, he has a cryotherapy chamber and a hyperbaric chamber at his house to ensure he recovers well, which has allowed him to keep performing at the top level even at 32.Also Read: Barcelona win 28th La Liga title after beating Espanyol With his Liverpool contract now safe until 2027, Mohamed Salah will make more money as he tries to help the team win more trophies over the next few years and hopefully spend a whole decade playing for the club.","Mohamed Salah's wealth is valued at about $90 million (£68 million) due to his strong performance on the field and different revenue sources.

Palestinian Football Federation calls for urgent resolution amid increasing regional tension.s

FIFA Secretary General cites ""complex topic"" as investigations continue amid criticism

FIFA decided to delay making a ruling on Israeli settlement clubs, which has sparked even more tension between the Palestinian and Israeli sides. During the FIFA Congress in Asuncion, Paraguay, on Thursday, Palestinian officials expressed their disappointment that FIFA is not setting a clear timeline for wrapping up the investigations that began in October 2024. Susan Shalabi, a leading Palestinian official and a member of the Asian Football Confederation, delivered a strong speech asking for immediate action on a problem that has not been solved for almost 15 years.FIFA is investigating two main points: allegations of discrimination by the Israel Football Association and the question of whether teams from West Bank settlements break FIFA’s statutes when they play in Israeli competitions. Such settlements are seen as illegal by international law, which makes what would be routine decisions much more political.Susan Shalabi pointed out at the Congress that the problems Palestinians have in soccer are visible, undeniable, but sadly not addressed, and the audience applauded his statement. She made sure that the governance panel was required to report their findings to President Gianni Infantino’s council within one month.Since 2009, the Palestinian Football Association has been pushing against settlement clubs, claiming they weaken Palestinian control and go against FIFA’s rules on territory.After Susan Shalabi finished speaking, FIFA Secretary General Mattias Grafström pointed out that the new committee members needed time to learn the details of the case. According to him, the committees are working hard to finalise a very complex subject.There are those who point out that FIFA reacted swiftly to Russia’s actions in Ukraine, but has delayed for years when it comes to Palestine. There is growing pressure on FIFA from human rights organisations to ensure its human rights policies are enforced regularly.The dispute began after tensions between Israel and the region increased because of recent clashes along the border. Administrators on all sides of football recognise that the sport cannot stay separate from what is happening internationally.Also Read: European football leaders stage walkout after Gianni Infantino delays FIFA Congress Following the progress of the FIFA Congress is possible through official FIFA channels and the major sports networks that are covering it until Friday.","FIFA delay making a ruling on Israeli settlement clubs.

Formula E Drivers on racing in wet conditions

The excitement is building ahead of the next Formula E race as Japan gets ready to host the second season of the Tokyo E-Prix. But the weather forecast shows a 100 percent chance of rainfall on both Saturday and Sunday. This is enough to concern the Formula E drivers, as—despite the much-improved Gen3 Evo cars this year running on Hankook tyres—racing in rain comes with hard-to-overcome challenges and risks. However, the rain may skip the Round 9 race Sunday evening. Here’s the complete weather forecast for the Tokyo Formula E race.According to Metcheck.com, the weather in Tokyo is expected to remain pleasant at 21 degrees Celsius on Friday, though it will be a cloudy day. There are only slight chances of rain as the Formula E drivers take part in the First Free Practice session at 4 pm (local time) and 12:30 pm IST.The temperature will remain in the range of 18–20 degrees Celsius on Saturday. However, there is a 100 percent chance of rain throughout the day. Rain in the range of 2.6 mm to 3.3 mm is expected during the Second Free Practice at 8 am (local time) and the Qualifying race at 10:20 am (local time). The rain is expected to be much lighter, at 0.9 mm, during the main Round 8 race at 3:05 pm (local time), which will be broadcast in India at 11:35 am.The temperature will be in the range of 19–20 degrees Celsius on Sunday, while the rain will continue to be as heavy as the day before. There is a 100 percent chance of around 3.8 mm of rain during the Third Free Practice at 8 am (local time) and the Round 9 Qualifying at 10:20 am. But the good news is that no rain is predicted for the main Round 9 race, which will start at 3:05 pm (local time) and 11:35 am IST.Mitch Evans told RacingNews365.com that it was “very, very tricky” to race in wet conditions with the Hankook tyres in the recent races. He said, “In qualifying it was like, I was terrible. Nothing, you can't wake them [the tyres] up. In the race I was way more comfortable from the start, but the pace difference between me and some other guys was huge. So yeah, you can quickly be two, three seconds a lap slower.”Also Read: Tokyo E-Prix 2025: Schedule, timing and where to watch Round 8 and Round 9 Formula E races Nyck De Vries told the portal about racing in wet conditions, ""If it's wet, you're not even reaching full throttle.

Obviously, street tracks are always challenging in the wet, and grip levels are low.""","The weather forecast shows a 100 percent chance of rainfall on both Saturday and Sunday.

All about the Tokyo Street Circuit

The ABB FIA Formula E World Championship returns to Tokyo for Rounds 8 and 9, as the Tokyo E-Prix double header prepares to electrify the city’s street circuit with cutting-edge Gen3 Evo cars this weekend.

The video highlights key features such as the Attack Mode zone, the acceleration zone, and the overtaking zone.Winner Maximilian Guenther had said after winning the Tokyo race last year, “The track is phenomenal. It’s super technical and super challenging for us and the teams to set everything up properly. To get super close to the walls, you have to have good confidence in the car, and there’s even jumps that we have in a lap, so it’s a big mixture of everything! For me that is what Formula E is all about, to race so tight around these street circuits.”Jaguar TCS Racing driver Nick Cassidy, who earned the ABB Driver of Progress Award with 12 overtakes during the race, praised the track as well. Reflecting on his experience, he said, “It was a mega, a proper Formula E track. Bumps, fast corners, on the limit and you’ve really got to attack in qualifying. I thought the track was fantastic.”Set in the heart of Tokyo Bay , the 2.575km circuit features 18 turns and boasts a compact, technical layout that includes three long straights and three chicane sequences.

Maximilian Gunther , who won the last Tokyo race as part of Maserati MSG Racing, has already secured one victory this season with DS Penske—in Jeddah—and will be aiming to continue his winning streak.Maximilian Gunther is the only Formula E driver this year to have converted a pole position into a win.He claimed victory in Jeddah Part 1, starting from pole and also recording the fastest lap. After clinching the win in Formula E Championship Round 3, he’ll be looking to replicate that success in Tokyo.After his Jeddah win, Günther shared a photo of himself with the trophy on Instagram, writing: “P1!!! What a race. What a day. What a feeling. Started from pole, dropped back to P9, and then fought back to take the win in the final corners, on the final lap. This one means everything! Today is a true testament to the hard work we’ve put in as a team over the past months, and it’s only the beginning. A massive thank you to everyone at @dsperformance and @ds_penske_fe, both here at the track and back at the factory. This win is for all of us.”However, Gunther couldn’t do much in his home city, Monaco, despite the double opportunities in the double header. He summed up his Monaco experience in a post that read: “Racing on the iconic streets of Monaco is always special. 🇲🇨 After a strong qualifying, we lined up P3 and gave it everything out there today. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the race pace and crossed the line in P8. Not the easiest weekend, but still walking away with two points finishes here. Now it’s time to reset and focus on Tokyo.”Also Read: Formula E: Driver premieres on Amazon Prime, offers unfiltered access to lives of Mitch Evans, Jake Dennis, Dan Ticktum and Antonio Da Costa Gunther made his Formula E debut with Dragon Racing, after serving as the team’s reserve driver during the 2017/18 season.

Nick Cassidy’s podium win was nothing short of magic

It’s not just Envision Racing driver Sebastien Buemi who made a massive comeback at the Monaco E-Prix Round 7, clinching a win after a long wait. Nick Cassidy of Jaguar TCS Racing also made his way to the podium after his last appearance in the Formula E World Championship Season 9. He secured the third spot on the podium after starting from a hardly encouraging fourteenth position.This deserves special mention for the determination and grit of the New Zealander.The official Instagram page of Formula E shared several videos of Nick Cassidy’s performance in Monaco, as he went on to claim third place after starting from a discouraging fourteenth position on the grid. The post was shared with the caption: “Nick Cassidy’s #MonacoEPrix Masterclass P14 to P3. Swipe to relive it! @ABBGroup.”A Formula E fan wrote in the comments section, “P14 to P3? In a Formula E car? In Monaco? In the rain??? That's why I started watching FE, sounds way more fun and competitive than a lot of F1 races.” Another wrote, “I definitely agree with you. I went to Monaco this weekend and now I am a mega fan of Formula E.”Nick was almost on cloud nine after bagging the podium spot in Monaco after a long time. He said after the Round 7 race, “It feels very, very sweet. I can’t fault my guys — it’s been an extremely tough start to the year, it’s no secret I’ve not been the happiest guy at times, but this one feels like a big monkey off the shoulders and I’m really proud of everyone’s efforts. On the inside, I’m jumping up and down, I’m very, very happy — it doesn’t get more special than here.

Sinner bounces back

Jannik Sinner set up a blockbuster Italian Open final with Carlos Alcaraz by beating Tommy Paul 1-6, 6-0, 6-3 on Friday.World number one Sinner fought back from a set down in front of a packed crowd to continue his march towards a first title at the Foro Italico .After a strangely slow start, Sinner again showed good form on centre court where, since returning to action last week from a three-month doping ban, he has taken his unbeaten run to 26 matches.And the 23-year-old will face down Alcaraz, the last man to beat Sinner in the final at the China Open in early October, with all eyes on another potential final between the pair at the French Open next month.A win for Sinner against his rival would see the men's Rome title go to an Italian for the first time since Adriano Panatta in 1976.""If I want to win Sunday I have to play one of my best tennis for sure,"" said Sinner.""Carlos has played incredible tennis today, so let's see what's coming but from my side you know incredible to be here in the final.""Alcaraz booked his place in the showdown by beating Sinner's countryman Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 7-6 (7/4).The four-time Grand Slam champion overcame Musetti and the windy conditions in just over two hours to reach his fourth final of the season.""I'm going to have dinner, but my phone is going to be there watching (Sinner's) match,"" said Alcaraz after his win.""I have to know against who I'm going to play. I have to watch the match and see how they are going to play.""Musetti was beaten by Alcaraz in the Monte Carlo final last month and fell to his fifth straight defeat to the Spaniard after a frustrating display.And he believes that Alcaraz will have the better of it against Sinner if he brings his top form on Sunday evening.""I really rate Carlos. I think on clay that the best version of Carlos is favourite against anyone... that includes Jannik,"" he told reporters.Paul rattled off the first five games in 21 minutes in a near replica of what Sinner did to Casper Ruud on Thursday, closing out the first set in less than half an hour.The last time Sinner lost a set 6-1 was in the quarter-finals of the US Open against Daniil Medvedev, a match he won on his way to his second Grand Slam triumph.Sinner looked a shadow of the player who dominated tennis throughout 2024 right up to the start of his suspension, which was agreed with the World Anti-Doping Agency in early February.But from nowhere he came roaring back in the second set, finally forcing Paul back with some deep baseline shots of his own and his first aces of the match to win the second set to love and level the match.It was a complete role reversal with Paul now the one being thrown around the court, the world number 12 winning just 12 points in the second set and looking bewildered at how quickly the momentum shifted.Paul then handed Sinner the initiative with his second double fault of the night in game two of the third set. The Italian eventually won nine games in a row and marched on to victory.Earlier, Jasmine Paolini continued her bid to win the women's singles and doubles titles in Rome after reaching her second final of the week, this time alongside fellow Italian Sara Errani .Paolini and Errani, the reigning doubles champions, will meet Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens in the final on Sunday, before which Paolini could already be crowed singles champion.Late bloomer Paolini takes on Coco Gauff on Saturday aiming for her second 1000 series title at the age of 29 and to become the first Italian women to win in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985.","Jannik Sinner will play Carlos Alcaraz in the Italian Open final. Sinner beat Tommy Paul 1-6, 6-0, 7-6 (7-4) to reach his fourth final of the season. Jasmine Paolini and Sara Errani will play in the women's singles final.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121226023,imgsize-36726,width-400,resizemode-4/Sinner-Rome-AP.jpg"

Gauff joins Paolini

Jannik Sinner marched into the semi-finals of the Italian Open on Thursday after destroying Casper Ruud in straight sets 6-0, 6-1 as Coco Gauff won a marathon three-set battle with China's Zheng Qinwen to advance to the women's final.American Gauff will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's title match after pulling through 7-6 (7/3), 4-6, 7-6 (7/4) in a match that lasted over three-and-a-half hours.Ruud was supposed to be Sinner's toughest test in Rome since he came back from his three-month doping ban, as the Norwegian came into the match in hot form on clay after winning in Madrid earlier this month.In his previous matches Sinner looked to be still finding his feet after his suspension, accepted from the World Anti-Doping Agency for testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year.But the 23-year-old demolished sixth seed Ruud in just over an hour with an ominous display of tennis, his domination such that the home fans at the packed centre court, seemingly out of sympathy, began to cheer the rare points that Ruud won.""I was feeling great on court today. I think we all saw that,"" said Sinner.""How I felt today was very, very positive signs for me... I was serving well and also returning well. Moving great on the court, so I'm very happy about that.""Ruud even got the loudest celebration of the match when he held his serve for the only time, in game three of the second set, holding his arms aloft in ironic joy.""He was just everywhere... it's just like playing a wall that you know shoots hundred miles an hour balls at you all the time,"" said a bewildered Ruud.Tommy Paul, a 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 winner over Hubert Hurkacz in the day's first match, will have wondered what on earth he can do to stop Sinner if the Italian brings that form to Friday's last-four clash.Sinner won the first set in just 27 minutes, giving up only seven points as he stalked the court with intent, dressed all in black as he has been all week.And he then maintained his record of not dropping a set in the tournament to not so much stroll as smash into the last four, and send a message to Carlos Alcaraz.Spaniard Alcaraz, Sinner's key Grand Slam rival ahead of the French Open, will contest the other semi-final with Lorenzo Musetti on Friday afternoon, with the blockbuster final tennis fans wanted still on.Gauff prevailed on a centre court left mostly empty by fans who headed for the exits in large numbers after watching Sinner's tennis clinic.Former US Open winner Gauff won her third straight match against Olympic gold medallist Zheng, after coming through a tie in which she made 15 double faults on serve and there were a combined total of 156 unforced errors.The 21-year-old is looking for her first title of the season after losing the Madrid final to Sabalenka, and against home hope Paolini will find herself in a much fiercer atmosphere than the soporific crowd which stayed till past midnight to watch her reach her second final of the year.""I told myself I'm ready to go home,"" said an exhausted Gauff.""It was tough for me, finding my rhythm especially at night, it was so slow, I just tried to stay in there.""I was frustrated. She forced me to get out of my comfort zone.""Sixth seed Paolini is the third Italian woman to reach the Foro Italico final, and the first since her doubles partner Sara Errani was thumped by Serena Williams in 2014.Late bloomer Paolini, 29, will have a chance to be the first woman from the Mediterranean nation to win in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985, after beating Peyton Stearns 7-5, 6-1.""It's a privilege to be in this position. I matured late as a tennis player but everyone has their own path. Some mature earlier and some later,"" said Paolini.""I'm just enjoying it without thinking too much about the past.""Paolini could yet win both the singles and women's doubles tournaments, with her and Errani taking on Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider in the semi-finals on Friday.","Jannik Sinner thrashes Casper Ruud in straight sets 6-0, 6-1. Coco Gauff beats China's Zheng Qinwen to reach women's final. Gauff will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's title match. Tommy Paul beats Hubert Hurkacz in day's first match.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121200918,imgsize-24478,width-400,resizemode-4/Jannik-Sinner-Rome-AP.jpg"

Poll What do you think about Jannik Sinner's chances at the Italian Open? He will be eliminated early He will reach the finals He will win the title

Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner met with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican City on Wednesday during a break from the Italian Open , presenting the pontiff with a tennis racket and offering to play. The meeting came after the pope, known for his liking towards the sport, had earlier joked about not inviting Sinner, making a wordplay on the athlete's surname.The encounter took place in the Vatican's auditorium reception room, where Sinner arrived with his parents.""It's an honor,"" Sinner said in Italian as he presented the pope with a racket and ball, suggesting a quick volley.The 69-year-old American pope, who hails from Chicago, declined the offer to play, looking at the surrounding antiques and saying, ""Better not.""Leo XIV made a light-hearted comment about his white cassock being appropriate for Wimbledon, referencing the tournament's all-white dress code. The meeting included discussions about Sinner's progress in the Italian Open, where he faces a quarterfinal match on Thursday against Madrid champion Casper Ruud.Sinner is returning to competition after a three-month doping ban, which was determined to be due to accidental contamination.The Italian player is aiming to become the first from his country to claim the Rome title since Adriano Panatta's victory in 1976.During the interaction, Italian Tennis and Padel Federation head Angelo Binaghi presented the pope with an honorary federation card. ""We all felt the passion that Leo XIV has for our sport and this filled us with pride,"" Binaghi stated. ""We hope to embrace the Holy Father again soon, maybe on a tennis court.""The meeting included a photo session featuring the Davis Cup trophy, which Sinner helped Italy secure for the second consecutive year. The Billie Jean King Cup trophy, won by Italy in 2024, was also displayed during the meeting.Earlier in the week, Sinner had responded positively to the pope's initial joke, noting it was ""a good thing for us tennis players"" to have a pope who enjoys the sport.Beyond tennis, Pope Leo XIV is known to be a devoted Chicago White Sox baseball fan, following in the tradition of his predecessor, Pope Francis, who supported the Buenos Aires football club San Lorenzo.","Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner met with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican City on Wednesday during a break from the Italian Open.

Travis Head punishes India with a counter-attacking hundred in Adelaide Test

Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes India's fast bowler Mohammed Siraj is likely to be penalized by the match referee for his fiery send-off to Travis Head after dismissing him on Day 2 of the pink-ball Test in Adelaide .After being flicked for a six by centurion Head, Siraj dismissed him next ball with a full delivery that crashed into the stumps. It led to Siraj giving Head the marching orders with a few unkind words as an unhappy Head also shot back.But the Australian batter had done his job by then, putting his team in the box seat with his attacking knock of 140 off 141 balls. India, who made just 180 in their first innings, then bowled out the hosts for 337 but fell behind by 157 runs.""That’s what you call the old-fashioned send-off – umpires and referees do not see kindly to stuff like that,"" said Ponting while speaking on Channel Seven. ""Siraj wasn't happy to be clipped over deep backward square for six... and he might have a bit to answer for.""Siraj copped a lot of criticism for his antics, including from former India captain Sunil Gavakar, who said Siraj became a ""villain"" for the Adelaide crowd, who booed the Indian bowler for his behaviour towards local boy Head.In their second innings, India slipped to 128 for 5, still 29 runs in the arrear and staring at a crushing defeat. Rishabh Pant was batting on 28 and Nitish Kumar Reddy on 15 when umpires called stumps on Saturday.Head was asked about the incident after the day's play and said that while he was ""surprised"" by the reaction, he doesn't want to give it too much ""air time"".""I actually jokingly said well bowled and then he pointed me to the sheds and I had my reaction as well. I don’t want to give it too much air time,"" said the Australian.""I was surprised at the reaction in terms of the situation of the game and in the lead-up. There was no confrontation leading up to it. I felt like it was probably a little bit far at the time. That's why I'm disappointed at the reaction that I gave back. But I'm also going to stand up for myself. That's not how I'd like to play the game.”","Ricky Ponting believes India's Mohammed Siraj is likely to be penalized by the match referee for his fiery send-off to Travis Head.

Marsh's controversial review and brain fade

Head record ton and cradle-roll celebration

Siraj's 'unnecessary' send-off!

India reeling at 128 for five

NEW DELHI: A sizzling Travis Head ton was followed by a shock late Indian collapse as Australia tightened their grip in the day-night Test in Adelaide on Saturday.After India succumbed to 180 all out on the opening day of the second Test, the Australia batters shone bright on Day 2 with Head leading the way, notching up an incredible 140 -- his 8th ton in the format.To go with Head century, the second day of the Pink-ball Test was all about drama at the Adelaide Oval as there was no shortage of entertainment.From puzzling calls being made by the umpires to Head cradle-roll celebration to Mohammed Siraj 's ugly send-off and then an Indian batting collapse, the second day turned out to be a cricketing blockbuster.Amid all the razzmatazz, Australia did seize control of the game as India found themselves tottering at 128 for 5 in the second innings at the close of play after the hosts piled up 337 in their first essay.As India trail by another 29 runs, here's a look at the key moments of the action-packed Day 2:The third umpire's call on an India review turned heads first, late in the first session, as the manner and the hastiness with which Richard Kettleborough went on with the on-field call of not out, puzzled many.In the penultimate over of the first session, India reviewed for LBW but umpire Kettleborough, without seeing multiple replays decided not to overturn the on-field call in a dramatic turn of events.However, Marsh couldn't make the most of his luck as early in the second session, he had a brain fade moment and ruled himself out even when he wasn't off an R Ashwin delivery.Assuming that he had edged the ball, Marsh walked back after the catch was completed but replays later showed that there was no bat involved and Marsh was indeed not out.Travis Head continued to be India's thorn in the flesh as he scored an almost run a ball ton to take the game away from India on the second day. Head smacked the India bowlers left, right and centre, notching up the fastest day-night ton off just 111 balls, breaking his own record of 112-ball century against England (Hobart in 2022).He then followed it with an adorable cradle-roll celebration, dedicating his ton to his 5-week old son Harrison, who was at the stadium.A fiery Siraj bowled his heart out but as Head ton and Marnus Labuschagne (64) denied India early success with frustration was visible on Indian faces. However, when Siraj got the better of Head, he sent him off in an unruly manner which led to pacer's criticism.Even legendary Sunil Gavaskar wasn't much impressed by Siraj's actions as he labeled the send-off unnecessary. He even went on to say that the actions made Siraj a villain.The Siraj send-off was followed by boos around the stadium.Amid all the drama, Australia wrapped up their first innings at 337 in reply to India's 180 and took a sizable 157-run first innings lead.Already on the back-foot, India had to come out strong in their second essay but suffered an early blow in KL Rahul, who was dismissed for 7 by Pat Cummins.Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill then briefly steadied the Indian ship but then Scott Boland came in and got rid of Jaiswal and Virat Kohli in quick succession as India slid to 66 for three.The wickets of Gill and Rohit Sharma then put India further back in the game as the visitors ended the day at 128 for 5, still trailing by another 29 runs.",India trail Australia by 29 runs after second day of Pink-ball Test in Adelaide. Travis Head scores 140 to take the game away from India on the second day. Mohammed Siraj was booed by the Adelaide crowd after sending off Head.

NEW DELHI: Yusuf Pathan , known for his big-hitting shots, on Friday voiced concerns, making a big statement over the ongoing standoff surrounding the 2025 Champions Trophy, set to take place in Pakistan The former all-rounder, now Member of Parliament, supported the Board of Control for Cricket in India's ( BCCI ) decision to not send the Indian team to Pakistan for the marquee event next year.The BCCI remains resolute in its decision against sending the national team across the border for the prestigious tournament scheduled in early 2024.Yusuf expressed support for this stance and commended the Indian cricket board for prioritising the security and well-being of the players.""The BCCI always thinks about the players and their safety. So whatever BCCI does is in the interest of the players and the nation,"" Pathan told news agency ANI.Following extensive discussions, the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) has shown flexibility in its earlier stance of hosting the complete tournament within Pakistan's borders.Recent negotiations between the ICC and PCB have led to a significant breakthrough, with both parties tentatively agreeing to implement a hybrid model for international tournaments scheduled in Pakistan or India till 2027.This approach would enable both nations to participate in ICC tournaments hosted by the other country, with their matches being played at a neutral venue.","Yusuf Pathan voiced concerns over the ongoing standoff surrounding the 2025 Champions Trophy, set to take place in Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: England batter Zak Crawley achieved a remarkable Test record by smashing a six in the opening over against New Zealand in Wellington.After New Zealand's captain Tom Latham elected to field first, Crawley aimed for a quick start whilst trying to find his rhythm. Facing Tim Southee in the first over, he initially got runs through a thick inside edge towards the leg side off the first delivery.Following two runs off the subsequent delivery, Crawley waited for his next scoring chance on Southee's final ball. He struck it powerfully straight back over the bowler, managing sufficient height to clear the long-off boundary for six.The over yielded 10 runs for England and marked a significant milestone for Crawley.This feat marks only the third instance in Test cricket history where a six was scored in the opening over.The previous two instances occurred in the same over when West Indies' Chris Gayle struck Sohag Gazi for two sixes during a Test match against Bangladesh match in 2012.Notably, as Gazi bowled spin, Crawley became the first batsman to hit a six off a pace bowler in the first over of a Test innings.",Zak Crawley hits a six in the opening over against New Zealand in Wellington.

Travis Head 's remarkable 141-ball innings of 140 during the pink-ball Test against India in Adelaide has garnered significant praise from cricketing icon Sunil Gavaskar Gavaskar, speaking to Star Sports, emphasised Head's distinctive approach to batting.""I think it's a difference in attitude. Where you look at every ball as a scoring opportunity, which is what he does. Which is what Rishabh Pant also does.

He not only stabilised the innings but also shifted the momentum firmly in his team's favor.Former Australian opener Matthew Hayden also commended Head's courage and consistency.""I think he made a promise to himself very early doors in his test match cricket. And some people aren't brave enough until they reach maybe 30 or even 40 test matches for their country. But he promised himself very early doors that he was going to play the way Travis Head wanted to play. And I admire that courage. Because it's not always easy.""Especially when you think back to the way that he's dominated India. When you think back to that world test championship, he would have got great confidence out of that. Because it was under some circumstances that he reached the crease at the Oval.

Mumbai: India and Mumbai's cricket greats Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Vengsarkar paid rich tributes to Maharashtra pacer Anwar Shaikh, who passed away on Saturday at the age of 79. Anwar took 162 wickets in 61 first-class matches from 1965-66 to.1977-78 at an average of 30.65, with three five-wicket hauls.Showering rich praise on Shaikh, the legendary Gavaskar told TOI: “He was a terrific bowler. He was nippy and could move the ball both ways. He was a big-hearted bowler who could bowl all day for his captain. Today, he would be much sought after. He was born in the wrong era when spin was the king in India. (I'm) Very sorry to hear of his passing away.”Narrating how he was massively impressed when he saw the late fast bowler in action for the first time when he was playing for his school, King George, in Mumbai, Vengsarkar recalled: “Not many people know this. I saw Anwar Shaikh bowl for the first time when I was 8-10 years old. Somehow, he was playing for our school team-King George School against Dadar Union in a friendly match . In those days, a lot of Test cricketers used to play these friendly matches, and as kids staying in the Hindu Colony, we would go to watch them. He was bowling brilliantly to Ramnath Keni, who was an India player back then.”Like Gavaskar, Vengsarkar too felt that Shaikh was unlucky to not have played for India. “I later faced him in the Ranji Trophy while playing for Bombay against Maharashtra, both in Bombay and then Pune. I later played with him for the West Zone in the Deodhar Trophy in Chepauk in Chennai in 1975-76. He was a great, outstanding bowler. It's very unfortunate that he could not play for India.”The 116-Test veteran gushed about Shaikh’s ability to move the ball around. “He had a mastery over moving the ball. He could swing the ball like a banana. He would immediately know the weakness of a batsman and get his wicket. Unfortunately for him, the Maharashtra fielders dropped a lot of catches off him in the slips. Had they taken all those catches, his wickets tally would have been doubled,” Vengsarkar concluded.","India and Mumbai's cricket greats Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Vengsarkar paid rich tributes to Maharashtra pacer Anwar Shaikh. Anwar took 162 wickets in 61 first- class matches from 1965-66 to. 1977-78 at an average of 30.65, with three five- wicket hauls.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116076228,imgsize-21090,width-400,resizemode-4/116076228.jpg"

So, fingers crossed for that day.”“I had a little bowl on one of the main training days, and was sort of just 70% then.

We know each other inside out. I think (my quotes) were taken a little bit out of context. It’s probably like asking an opening batter about trying to take 10 wickets the next day.”“You’re not a big part of it. From a number 11’s point of view, that was probably my thinking at the time.

Forest kept the home side at bay after Bruno Fernandes pulled one back.United's Andre Onana was embarrassed by a swerving Gibbs-White strike for Forest's second while the goalkeeper, Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs De Ligt all failed to deal with a looping Wood header for the third.The win lifts Forest to fifth in the Premier League table.

Jude Bellingham guided champions Real Madrid to a comfortable 3-0 victory at Girona on Saturday in La Liga , with Kylian Mbappe also on the scoresheet after two high-profile penalty misses in recent games.Los Blancos cut the gap on league leaders Barcelona to two points after the Catalans drew 2-2 at Real Betis , with Madrid having played one fewer match.Bellingham opened the scoring before half-time and set up Turkish playmaker Arda Guler for Madrid's second, before Mbappe produced a clinical finish for their third.Both Bellingham and defender Ferland Mendy were replaced with apparent knocks in the second half ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash at Atalanta.Coach Carlo Ancelotti confirmed Bellingham was ""available"" for the game but said Mendy had suffered a muscular injury.After Madrid's fifth defeat across all competitions in midweek against Athletic Bilbao, having lost just twice last season, Ancelotti pledged his team would improve and they were significantly better against Girona.""Bellingham scored his fifth goal running (in La Liga), Mbappe scored, Brahim (Diaz) did good work, Arda scored a great goal,"" Ancelotti said.""We have to bear the moment out and as I said, bit by bit we will come back (to form).""With Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo sidelined, Ancelotti selected Bellingham and Diaz in support of Mbappe.The French forward has been the focus of criticism in recent weeks after blowing penalties against Liverpool and Athletic Bilbao, and struggling to find the form which made him a star with Paris Saint-Germain and his country.Girona, who ran Madrid close for the Spanish title for much of last season before eventually finishing third, started the stronger but Madrid soon clicked into gear.Bellingham pounced after 36 minutes when Diaz's cross was blocked and the ball fell kindly to the England international to drill home.It was Bellingham's fifth goal in his last five La Liga games, finding the form which powered Madrid to a Champions League and La Liga double last season.Los Blancos got their second in the 55th minute when Bellingham threaded through a fine pass for Guler to finish.Mbappe rattled in Madrid's third from a tight angle after Bellingham hobbled off with a knock after Luka Modric played him in down the right.Ancelotti will hope Madrid can carry some momentum into the vital Champions League visit to Atalanta, for which Vinicius is expected to return from a hamstring problem.Girona, eighth in La Liga, welcome Liverpool in the Champions League on Tuesday.Earlier Real Betis twice came behind to stop Barcelona from triumphing in Seville.Assane Diao levelled in the 94th minute to stun Barcelona, who opened the scoring after 39 minutes through Robert Lewandowski.After Giovani Lo Celso levelled for the mid-table hosts from the penalty spot, substitute Ferran Torres struck what seemed the winner before Diao's late intervention.Barcelona coach Hansi Flick said his team had to improve on the road, where most of their set-backs have come this season.""We have the quality to win every match but we also have to show that,"" said Flick.""(In) the away matches we have to be much stronger than we played here.""Real Betis started strongly, with Raphinha forced to clear Diego Llorente's header off his own goal-line.The electric Yamal helped Barcelona get on top as Betis sat deep and the Catalans found the breakthrough shortly before the break with a slick move finished by Lewandowski.It was the 36-year-old striker's 16th league goal of the campaign and he leads the charts in Spain.The hosts levelled with a penalty converted by Lo Celso, when Frenkie de Jong stepped on the heel of Vitor Roque, on loan at Betis from Barca, with Flick sent off for protesting.""I'm really disappointed about (my red card), I thought that would never happen to me,"" Flick told reporters.Torres netted his second goal in two games to put Barca back in front before Diao struck late on.""I'm very happy with the goal,"" said the 19-year-old forward.

Three-time Davis Cup winners Germany eased into the semi-finals with a 2-0 victory against Canada on Wednesday.Jan-Lennard Struff defeated Denis Shapovalov 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7/5) to avenge Germany's defeat in the 2022 quarter-finals by eventual victors Canada.Daniel Altmaier beat Gabriel Diallo 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 in the opening singles rubber to send Germany ahead in the quarter-final clash.Germany, who last won the competition in 1993, will face Netherlands in the final four after they defeated Spain to bring the curtain down on Rafael Nadal's 23-year career ""It was a very good, tough game, Shapa was firing his serves in, first serves and second serves... he was changing directions a lot, it was tough to read the serve,"" said Struff.""The court was pretty fast so it was tough to stay calm. I managed to stay in the game and in the set...""We're in the semis now, we're very happy, let's look forward to Friday.""Shapovalov clinched the first set against Struff with a fine forehand winner with the only break in the 10th game.Veteran Struff, world number 43, was up against the ropes for much of the second set but produced a break in the 11th game before holding to force a third set.The big-serving Shapovalov committed several double faults, with one resulting in Struff breaking for a 4-3 lead in the third set, moments after the Canadian had smashed his racquet onto the floor in frustration for losing the previous point.Shapovalov, ranked 56th, recovered to break for 5-5 as Struff faltered when serving for the match, leading to a tie-break.However the Canadian lost the match and the tie for his country with his 13th double fault.World number 88 Altmaier racked up a 5-0 lead in the first set tie-break against Diallo before closing it out to take the lead.In the second set Altmaier survived two break points in the first game and then broke himself in the 10th and final game to triumph as Diallo crumbled.""I wish I could have brought my team the point. They counted on me to deliver and I didn't deliver, so that's on me,"" said Diallo.Altmaier admitted he felt extremely nervous ahead of the match.""Definitely the nerves were a lot, I was saying to the captain in the morning when I was warming up I was really nervous coming up to the match,"" he said.""I guess (it) helps me a lot to communicate this openly, not to hide away my nerves.""","Germany beat Canada 2-0 in Davis Cup quarter-final in Malaga.

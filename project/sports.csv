AHMEDABAD: With captain Rohit Sharma back among the runs with a splendid 90-ball 119 in the second ODI, there are hopes Virat Kohli will follow suit. The star batter will be expecting to regain some batting form ahead of the Champions Trophy in the third ODI against England here on Wednesday.While it may be a dead rubber, it is an ideal situation for the Delhi cricketer to spend time in the middle as India eye a clean sweep.The hosts have ticked most of the boxes in the series but some gaps still remain. In both matches, England's openers got off to brisk starts while batting first, a concern for new-ball pacers Mohammed Shami and Harshit Rana. With left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh , who recently became India's highest wicket-taker in T20Is, warming the bench, the management might be inclined to give the Punjab left arm pacer an opportunity in this game.Shami, who has taken two wickets (2/104 in 15.1 overs) in as many matches so far, has been far from his usual self. His lack of incisiveness and penetration upfront has meant captain Rohit has been relying on the spinners to pull things back in the middle overs.With Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel providing the allround options, the last spinner's slot will be a fight between the left-arm wrist spin of Kuldeep Yadav and 'mystery' spin of Varun Chakravarthy .On the batting front, Rohit apart, Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer and Axar Patel have been in good nick.As for Kohli, it was at this ground that his dismissal by Australia captain Pat Cummins in the final of the ODI World Cup silenced the crowd. That final was the only loss - and the one that rankles the most - India have suffered in the five ODIs they have played here so far.England, on the other hand, have frittered away good starts and found themselves in a middle-overs muddle. Can they pull off a consolation win?",India face England in the third ODI on Wednesday. Captain Rohit Sharma scored a superb 119 in the 2nd ODI. Virat Kohli will be hoping to follow suit after a poor run of form. India are looking to complete a clean sweep in the series.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118160078,imgsize-53366,width-400,resizemode-4/118160078.jpg"

Travelling reserve:

NEW DELHI: Mitchell Starc pulled out of this month's event in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates for personal reasons and Australia will attempt to win the ICC Champions Trophy for the first time since 2009 using a completely new pace bowling line-up.As the only player from Australia's ""big three"" fast bowling attack to participate in all seven Test matches against India and Sri Lanka this summer, Starc will be sidelined for the match along with fellow quick Josh Hazlewood and skipper Pat Cummins (ankle).All three of Australia's top fast bowlers from the team that led them to the 50-over World Cup victory in India just over a year ago will be absent from the competition, along with injured all-rounders Marcus Stoinis (who abruptly quit ODI cricket last week) and Mitchell Marsh (back). Steve Smith will captain Australia.During Sri Lanka's second innings of last week's last Test in Galle, Starc appeared uncomfortable with a left ankle problem while bowling just four overs. He has requested privacy and would not comment on his decision.Starc is expected to miss the two-match ODI series against Sri Lanka that begins in Colombo today because he reportedly left for Australia right after that match.The reasons behind Starc's departure are still unknown, but Cricket Australia has stated that they fully back the 35-year-old, who is on the verge of reaching 400 Test wickets and 100 Test appearances.""We understand and respect Mitch's decision,"" chair of the national selection panel George Bailey said today.""Mitch is deeply respected for his commitment to international cricket and the priority he places on performing for Australia.""His well-documented ability to play through pain and adversity, as well as forgoing opportunities in other parts of his career to put his country first should be applauded.""His loss is of course a blow for the Champion's Trophy campaign but does provide an opportunity for someone else to make a mark on the tournament.""With the departure of the pace trio, Australia's final 15-man Champions Trophy roster now includes next-generation quicks Spencer Johnson, Nathan Ellis, Sean Abbott, and Ben Dwarshuis.Smith was named captain in Cummins' absence after leading Australia to a 2-0 Test series victory over Sri Lanka and winning player of the series.Smith will also captain the ODI team in this week's two 50-over matches against Sri Lanka in Colombo, which serve as warm-up games before Australia's Champions Trophy campaign kicks off on February 22 against England in Lahore.Australia has won the Champions Trophy twice, in 2006 and 2009. The competition was last played in the UK in 2017, with Pakistan defeating India in the final at The Oval.Steve Smith (c), Sean Abbott, Alex Carey, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Aaron Hardie, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Spencer Johnson, Marnus Labuschagne, Glenn Maxwell, Tanveer Sangha, Matthew Short, Adam ZampaCooper Connolly","Mitchell Starc pulls out of ICC Champions Trophy for personal reasons.

Axar Patel embraces new role as batting enforcer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/england-tour-of-india-2025/axar-patel-embraces-new-role-as-batting-enforcer/articleshow/118160272.cms,"AHMEDABAD: In the final of the T20 World Cup in West Indies in June last year, many questioned the wisdom of promoting left-handed allrounder Axar Patel to the No. 5 slot ahead of the hard-hitting Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube. Axar, as it turned out, delivered with a crucial 31-ball 47, including a sublime straight six off pacer Kagiso Rabada.Eight months down the line, with another ICC event on the horizon, India seem to be favouring the same template, playing Axar at No. 5 in a line-up not comprising Rishabh Pant . Pant, in fact, continues to sit out, with KL Rahul doing wicket keeping duties.In this series, with openers Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill complementing each other nicely, veteran Virat Kohli at No. 3 and the in-form Shreyas Iyer at No. 4, the team has the flexibility to play Axar as a floater.With 93 runs in his first two matches, that too as the sole left-handed option in the middle order, Axar has justified the move.Former Gujarat Ranji coach Hitesh Majmudar , under whom the 31-year-old Axar made his debut in domestic circuit, told TOI, ""Axar's batting credentials are not talked about enough. He played a vital role in Gujarat winning the Vijay Hazare trophy in 2015-16 and the Syed Mushtaq Ali in 2014-15. He has the ability to hit the ball to all parts of the ground, which makes his batting a vital aspect of his game. He showed that with his innings in Barbados, which allowed Virat to play his game and Dube to accelerate as usual.""Whenever Axar has been given the opportunity to bat up the order, he has delivered. He plays according to the situation. He is refining his game to suit the needs of the team. He works hard on his batting and is among the best allrounders India currently have. While Ravindra Jadeja is more of a bowling allrounder, Axar is a proper batting allrounder,"" said Majmudar, who played domestic cricket for Gujarat.Apart from his well-known brand of left-arm spin - different to Jadeja's style - Axar is generally known as a safe fielder too, adding to his utility in the team.",Axar Patel has scored 93 runs in his first two matches for India. The 31-year- old is the sole left-handed option in the middle order. Former coach Hitesh Majmudar says Axar's batting credentials are not talked about enough.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118160258,imgsize-56706,width-400,resizemode-4/118160258.jpg"
Champions League: Real Madrid stun Man City as PSG down Brest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/champions-league/top-stories/champions-league-real-madrid-stun-man-city-as-psg-down-brest/articleshow/118159439.cms,"NEW DELHI: Real Madrid twice overcame deficits to defeat Manchester City 3-2 in the first leg of their highly anticipated Champions League play-off match on Tuesday, with Jude Bellingham scoring the game-winning goal in stoppage time. Meanwhile, Paris Saint-Germain dominated an all-French match against Brest.Erling Haaland's double versus Madrid, his first goals in five games, appeared to have given Pep Guardiola's team a little lead, but the defending European champions are now heavy favorites to advance to the round of 16 going into next week's return leg in Spain.""It was a weird one. We played some of our best football of the season and ended up behind,"" Bellingham told Amazon Prime.""I don't care what form City are in they are still an unbelievable team. It's always tricky to play against them and we finally took the chance at the end.""City and Madrid have faced off in the competition's knockout round for the fourth straight season; in their last three meetings, the victor has gone on to win the Champions League trophy.After Josko Gvardiol chested down a cross from Jack Grealish, Haaland drove past Thibaut Courtois to give City the lead in the 19th minute, capping off a sluggish start at the Etihad.Haaland was denied a second goal shortly after halftime when his deflected shot bounced against the wall, and Madrid's Vinicius Junior struck the crossbar before City defender Manuel Akanji followed suit with a header.Dani Ceballos clipped the ball back into the area where Mbappe's mishit effort looped into the net after going off his shin and leaving Ederson stranded, giving Madrid the equalizer an hour after the City wall repelled a free-kick.After Ceballos clattered Phil Foden, Haaland tucked away a penalty to give City the lead again ten minutes from the end.However, after a terrible Ederson kick in the 86th minute, former City player Brahim Diaz tied the score for Madrid. Bellingham then punished the home team for more dubious defending when the England midfielder scored the game-winning goal in the dying seconds.""I don't know how to put it into words straight away, it's so raw and frustrating for everyone,"" said City defender John Stones.""It's a feeling of anger and frustration,"" he added. ""We need to see games out better. We need to step up when these bad moments happen.""Ousmane Dembele scored twice for PSG in a 3-0 victory over Brest in France, continuing his incredible goal-scoring run.Following a VAR review for a handball by Pierre Lees-Melou, a midfielder for Brest, Vitinha scored a penalty.Brest came very close to tying the dominant Ligue 1 leaders twice while playing an hour away in Guingamp due to their own stadium's noncompliance with UEFA regulations.While trying to knock the ball behind for a corner, Achraf Hakimi grazed the other upright, and Abdallah Sima hammered a header against the post.After a brilliant team play, Dembele swept past Marco Bizot at his near post to score PSG's second goal just before halftime.Halfway through the second half, the France international scored again with the help of a deflection, giving him 18 goals in his last 11 games.""Ousmane is full of confidence just now. He was good in 2024 and he is even better in 2025,"" said PSG coach Luis Enrique.In the first leg of their match in Turin, Juventus defeated PSV Eindhoven 2-1 at home.In the first half, US international Weston McKennie gave Juventus the lead before Ivan Perisic tied the score for the Netherlands.In the 82nd minute, Samuel Mbangula scored a close-range goal to give Juventus the victory.Borussia Dortmund defeated Sporting Lisbon 3-0 on the road, putting them on the verge of the round of 16.On sixty minutes, Pascal Gross scored a second goal for the runners-up from the previous season, and Serhou Guirassy's soaring header gave the German team the advantage.Following Nuri Sahin's dismissal at the end of January, new coach Niko Kovac secured his first victory with a late third from Karim Adeyemi.",Real Madrid defeat Manchester City 3-2 in Champions League play-off.

How MI Cape Town won the SA20 title,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/how-mi-cape-town-won-the-sa20-title/articleshow/118159250.cms,"NEW DELHI: MI Cape Town put on strong performances in the last week of SA20 Season 3, defeating the Paarl Royals in Qualifier 1 by batting first and then defeating the Sunrisers Eastern Cape , the reigning champions, in the final at Wanderers to win the coveted title.In the Powerplay, where bowlers have largely dominated this season and frequently force batting sides into a rebuilding phase, MI Cape Town was by far the best batting team. Rassie van der Dussen , who played in 11 of MI Cape Town's 12 games and had a perfect Powerplay record-never being dismissed within the first six overs of the competition while maintaining a Powerplay strike rate of 136-was unquestionably the main batsman in MICT's early innings dominance. Ryan Rickelton , who scored 220 runs off 124 balls inside the Powerplay, provided help for Van der Dussen. His strike rate of 177 was the highest of any batter inside the Powerplay, and the only other batter to reach 150 or more was Lhuan-dre Pretorius.In Qualifier 1 against the Royals, MI Cape Town put up 66-0 in the Powerplay thanks to quick runs by Rickelton to 30 off 17 and van der Dussen to 31 off 19. After Rickelton hammered 33 off 15 in the Powerplay against Sunrisers in the Final, MICT found themselves 52-2 after the first six overs, but Van der Dussen held steady on 19 off 18.Dewald Brevis had his greatest batting season in Season 3 after a few challenging SA20 campaigns, amassing 291 runs at an average of 48.5 and a strike rate of 184.Brevis scored 252 off 138 when he came out to bat between Over 7 and Over 12, including two fifties and several high impact scores between 20 and 50, such as 44 off 30 in Qualifier 1 and 38 off 18 in the Final.When held back, Brevis was unable to leave a lasting impression, reaching double figures in only one of the four innings he came to the crease following the 14th over.Throughout the competition, Brevis was devastating against pace, hitting at 211 versus the quicks with a good average of 37. He struck at 254 against full deliveries, compared to just 145 against length, when he faced only 11% of deliveries, suggesting that Pacers were playing to his strengths by bowling a full length to him 53% of the time.Considering the caliber of spinners on exhibit in this season's competition, he struck at 149 and was removed just once against the spinners. George Linde , a left-hander, was another important component of the MICT batting lineup. Throughout the competition, he was extremely crucial due to his ability to get going immediately with the bat. He struck at 136 in his first 10 balls at the crease and then increased that strike rate to 232 after facing 10 deliveries.Linde demonstrated his selflessness as a batter by playing brief, high-impact innings that gave the MICT batting unit momentum. He faced more than 20 balls just once during the tournament.His ability to counter strong spin units with left-arm spin (his stock trade) was crucial in the playoffs. Linde helped with 26 off 14 in Qualifier 1, which included three sixes off left-arm spinners, and 20 off 14 in the Final, which included two sixes off Liam Dawson.MI Cape Town frequently set the stage for Delano Potgieter to tee off at the back-end with strong performances at the top of the order and throughout the middle overs.Potgieter was MI Cape Town's batting surprise star. He didn't bowl or bat in two games during the season, so he wasn't expected to contribute much, but when he did, he was excellent.During the 2025 season, Potgieter amassed 166 runs in the final five overs of the innings, more than any other batter. The southpaw was equally skilled at facing the short ball (181 strike rate) as he was against anything full (181 strike rate), frequently leaving bowling units unable to come up with a strategy to counter him. In Qualifier 1, MI Cape Town went from what may have been a par total to an above-par total of 199 thanks to a 32 off 17 from Potgieter.After finishing as the slowest scoring team in the first season and just the fourth-highest scoring death overs team in 2024, MI Cape Town's final overs scoring rate of 11.26 was by far the highest in the tournament, demonstrating their growth as a batting unit.Sunrisers Eastern Cape were the only other team with a win rate above 50% this season while batting first, with five victories in nine games. MI Cape Town won six of their eight completed matches when batting first this season, including both the Qualifier 1 and the Final.MICT recorded only three victories in 11 SA20 2023 and 2024 games when batting first, making it a thorn in their side during the first two editions.In addition to converting a glaring weakness into a strength, MICT did so in consecutive high-pressure Playoffs games to end as Season 3 champions and bring a statement victory to end the reign of Playoffs experts Sunrisers Eastern Cape. They achieved this by following a clear blueprint as a batting unit and by having strong individuals step up.",MI Cape Town won SA20 Season 3 by batting first in the Powerplay. Rassie van der Dussen was the main batsman in MICT's early innings dominance. Delano Potgieter was MI Cape Town's batting surprise star.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118159240,imgsize-94742,width-400,resizemode-4/118159240.jpg"

From Tripura to vaulting table: Dipa Karmakar's rise

Road to mastering Produnova: A leap of faith



Changing the face of Indian gymnastics

Retirement call: The final bow

Life after retirement: A new chapter begins

A legacy of courage

NEW DELHI: ""You may trod me in the very dirt / But still, like dust, I'll rise,"" wrote American poet Maya Angelou in her timeless work. Doesn't it look as if Dipa Karmakar , undoubtedly the brightest name in Indian gymnastics, is the protagonist in Angelou's verses?From battling countless challenges, limited infrastructure in her home state of Tripura, injuries, and the weight of expectations to scripting history on the global stage, Dipa’s story is only one of its kind. But why compare it to Angelou's feminist poem?""In 2011, there was a foreign coach — though I won’t take the name — who said that women couldn’t achieve much because, according to him, women only come to national camps to pass the time, roam around, and eat. That day, I didn’t feel good at all as an athlete. Because no one leaves their family and comes to a camp just to roam and eat,"" Dipa recalls during an exclusive interaction withHowever, that maligned remark, rather than breaking her spirit, ignited a fire within. Guided by her long-time coach Bishweshwar Nandi , she set her sights on a daring move — the Produnova vault, one of the most difficult and dangerous feats in gymnastics.""Sir said, ‘Why can’t we do it? We can do it too.’ That’s when we slowly decided to choose the Produnova vault. Before that, I had competed in several World Cups and reached vault finals at the Commonwealth and Asian Games. But I wanted more — I wanted a medal,"" Dipa recollects. ""Women’s gymnastics in India had no major international medals then. That’s when Sir told me, ‘If you can master this vault...’ And I told him, ‘Sir, whatever you ask me to do, I am ready — just for the sake of bringing a medal for us.’""The journey of a girl from a small town in Tripura to the grand stage of the Olympics was anything but easy.Unlike athletes from bigger cities with access to world-class facilities, Dipa trained in a place where gymnastics infrastructure was nominal, and support system involving physiotherapists and sports doctors was virtually nonexistent.Yet, against all odds, she rose.Her tryst with gymnastics began at the age of five and a half at the Vivekananda Byamagar Club under the guidance of coach Soma Nandi.It was her father’s vision that led her to the sport. Coming from a family that encouraged athletic pursuits, Dipa and her elder sister, Puja Karmakar , were both introduced to sports. However, while Puja eventually moved on, Dipa found her passion in gymnastics.Her first taste of victory came in 2002 at the North East Games in Agartala, where she won her first gold medal, marking the beginning of a journey that would only take her to heights no Indian woman gymnast had reached before.Recognising her potential, Kamal Saha, the then sports secretary of Tripura, advised a shift to a better-equipped sports complex.This decision influenced a significant turning point in Dipa’s life as her coach also decided it was time for a change, and that’s when she began training under Bishweshwar Nandi, the mentor who would shape her into a world-class gymnast.At that stage, the Olympics was a distant dream. Unlike today, where young gymnasts aspire to Olympic glory, Dipa’s focus was simple — winning a national gold medal.""At first, I never dreamt that I would go to the Olympics. Back then, my only goal was to win a gold medal at the national level,"" she admits.At the age of 14, she competed at the 2007 Junior Nationals in Jalpaiguri, West Bengal, winning an impressive haul of three golds and two silvers.This success earned her a spot in the national camp for the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Kolkata. And making the most of the opportunity, she reached the vault final at the Commonwealth Games, followed by another final appearance at the Asian Games.These experiences made her believe that she belonged on the international stage, and from that point, the chase for medals truly began.Mastering the Produnova vault, one of the most dangerous moves in gymnastics, is not just any athlete's cup of tea.An intimate affair with the infamous ""vault of death"" began step by step, as she slowly built the foundation for what would become her signature move.If Dipa's words are to be believed, it took her eight to nine months of rigorous training to perfect, though she attempted it much earlier — within just 3 to 5 months.When the time came for her first real attempt, even the chief coach hesitated.""When the chief coach was asked, he said, ‘Not today; we’ll try it tomorrow!’ That made me so angry that I said, ‘If you don’t let me attempt it tomorrow, I’ll come alone and do it myself.’ Hearing that, they got a little scared,"" she recalls with a laugh.The hesitation was justified. The Produnova is one of the riskiest vaults in gymnastics, involving two and a half somersaults. A single miscalculation in timing could lead to devastating, even life-threatening, injuries. But Dipa was undeterred.""Only five people in the world have performed this vault, and I am the third among them. Naturally, there’s some level of risk involved. But I was so confident that I knew I could do it and that I had to do it.""In terms of medals, her first major breakthrough came at the 2014 Commonwealth Gymnastics Championships, where she clinched a gold and a silver. However, the wait for a successful Produnova landing went on.With confidence at an all-time high, she entered the 2014 Commonwealth Games, determined to deliver her best performance.But fate had other plans.""On the first day, during the qualifications, I fractured my leg — it was a severe crack. My leg swelled up badly, but somehow, despite the pain, I qualified in 7th position for the finals,"" Dipa recalls.The finals were a make-or-break moment — not just for her, but for Indian women’s gymnastics. A medal could keep the sport alive in the country; failure could mean fading into obscurity for the Indian women's gymnast team.With Dipa's leg in excruciating pain, the doctors strongly advised against competing.""They told me, ‘Give up, Didi. Dipa, how will you do it? It’s not possible,’"" Dipa recounts. ""But my teammates motivated me a lot, saying, ‘Didi, you have to do it!’""Dipa finally decided to go ahead. And for the first time in her career, she successfully landed the Produnova vault, securing her first Commonwealth Games medal.In the following years, she continued to push boundaries, winning a bronze at the 2015 Asian Championships, finishing 4th at the Asian Games, and securing 5th place at the World Championships. Then came the Rio Olympics qualifier — where she not only booked her ticket to the biggest sporting event in the world but also won gold at the test event.For Dipa, mastering the Produnova was more than just about proving herself. It was about proving every doubter wrong. It was about showing that an Indian woman gymnast could stand on par with the best in the world.Today, when people who once dismissed her now say, ""We are proud of you, Dipa,"" she considers that her greatest victory.""Before Rio, no one knew Dipa Karmakar, no one knew gymnastics, and no one knew Tripura. After Rio, these three things got recognition. I believe that this is my biggest achievement — gymnastics was a sport that everyone used to call a circus, but now people don’t say that anymore. Now, it's a sport that can shape the careers of children in the country,"" a proud Dipa tellsHer fourth-place finish at the 2016 Rio Olympics may not have brought home a medal, but it transformed the topography of Indian gymnastics.ALSO READ: A Sunil Chhetri penalty save that gave India their 'Leicester City' and Albino Gomes a 'memory for life' From being an overlooked discipline, often dismissed as mere acrobatics, gymnastics is now a legitimate career path for young athletes.And Tripura, a small northeastern state ""often mistaken for being part of Bangladesh"", is a recognised hub of talent.""Hearing that the talented children in Tripura have come forward really makes me happy. In India, the way women's participation in gymnastics was low, it has now risen. There's so much interest among girls in gymnastics — whether it's about performing or winning medals — that I feel very proud knowing that after the Olympics, so many changes have occurred.""With recognition came fame, something Dipa never actively sought but humbly embraced.""Earlier, people didn’t approach for selfies, but now they come for selfies and autographs. I am like Tripura's golden girl. And meeting Sachin Tendulkar Amitabh Bachchan , going to KBC, and meeting Prime Minister Modi Sir — these experiences have been amazing.""Yet, despite all the accolades, Dipa remains grounded in reality. For her, dreams are important, but they are only meaningful when turned into reality.""I don’t like to just dream; I prefer to live in reality, but without dreams, reality can’t happen either. Many dreams in my life have been fulfilled, but not everything has come true — some dreams remain unfulfilled. Olympic and Asian Games medals are still there, but I hope something good will happen because these dreams have stayed with me.""On an odd evening in October 2024, Dipa, at the age of 31, shreds an unforeseen announcement of her retirement , marking the end of a journey that saw her defy the odds, shatter stereotypes, and place Indian gymnastics on the global map.As a five-year-old with flat feet, she was told she would never make it as a gymnast. But determination proved her stronger than biology.Over a 25-year career, Dipa’s achievements were groundbreaking.However, behind the medals and milestones was a battle with her own body.""My body was not cooperating at all; I had undergone two surgeries. The last 5-6 years were really tough — my life was in a bad place. After the Olympics, my down period started, and after two knee surgeries, my knees were in really bad condition. Practising while taking painkillers every day was not easy. I had two ACL surgeries, my shoulder was injured, and just before the Asian Championship, I cracked my wrist. My ankle has been broken so many times, I don’t even know — at least 20-25 times. When your body doesn’t allow you to go on, just pushing through doesn’t bring any benefit,"" Dipa shares, reflecting on making an abrupt retirement call.Nevertheless, it was not so abrupt on her side. The final decision came after Dipa won gold at the 2024 Asian Championships. She discussed the possibility of retirement with her coach and family. The verdict was clear: it was time to let go.""I used to cry during practice every day because of the pain in my legs and hands. Vaulting was my main event, and when I couldn’t do vaulting anymore, nothing else seemed to matter. Sir said it was the best time to retire. By God’s grace, I became the national champion six times. I may not have won an Olympic or Asian Games medal, but I want the next generation to achieve that.""""Naturally, my family was very upset and told me to try again if I could. But I told them — this is the condition of my legs. My father was a weightlifting coach at SAI. But parents are always parents — they naturally get worried. If I hadn’t had the surgeries on my hands and if my body had allowed me, then retirement would never have been a discussion,"" an emotional Dipa adds.For Dipa Karmakar, though, retirement hasn’t meant slowing down — it’s been quite the opposite.""Since retirement, I have become much busier. Earlier, it was all about practice, rest, and living a strictly disciplined life — everything, including food, was very strict. Now, I eat whatever I can get. I love food, especially fish and meat — I can’t live without them. I also love sweets. I’m a foodie. But due to the pressure at work, I don’t get time to rest in the afternoon. Life has completely changed.""Now serving as the Deputy Director of the Tripura Sports Department, she finds herself in a different kind of pressure — somewhere in the middle of balancing administrative duties with her passion for coaching young gymnasts.""I wasn’t as active on social media before, but now I am much more active. Now, I can spend more time with my family. Life has become much more undisciplined; I’m gaining weight because I eat so much, and I’m wondering what will happen to me in future (laughs).""But beyond the newfound freedom in food and lifestyle, what worries her most is the shifting mindset of young athletes today.""Nowadays, children always think short-term; they can’t think long-term, and they want things to be achieved quickly. But when I look at my own life, I feel that the faster you get something, the faster it slips away. There’s a saying that if you get something without struggling, you won’t understand the value of it. So, they really need to build their mental strength. Earlier, there were a lot of children in the field, but now the numbers have significantly decreased.""With her decades of experience, Dipa hopes to give back to Indian gymnastics by mentoring the next generation. But balancing it with her government role is a challenge.""I want to coach children in the coming days. I enjoy coaching, but I don't know how far I will go because I am currently the Deputy Director of the Tripura Sports Department.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali showered praise on Indian captain Rohit Sharma for his explosive knock in the second ODI against England. Rohit, who was under immense pressure following a prolonged lean phase, silenced his critics with a stunning 119 off 90 balls, smashing 12 fours and seven sixes.Basit was particularly impressed with Rohit's fearless approach in ODIs, highlighting that the Indian skipper does not play with a fear of failure.""What is the worst thing that can happen? He will get out for a duck. But he should play his natural game like he did in the 2023 ODI World Cup and sidelined the opposition in the first 10 overs,"" Basit remarked on his YouTube channel.The former cricketer emphasised that Rohit's knock reaffirmed the old adage that class is permanent.""He silenced everyone with his performance. We say this very often that form is temporary, class is permanent. He showed the same,"" he added.With this victory, Team India has taken an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, a significant boost ahead of the Champions Trophy “All eyes will be on India after the match (Cuttack ODI), because of the way they chased down the 304-run target,” Basit said.Despite England's series defeat, Basit suggested that playing against India has only benefited them, as they gained valuable experience on subcontinental pitches similar to those in Pakistan, where the Champions Trophy will be held.""India won the series, but even if they whitewash, England have only gained from this series. They haven't lost anything. Their batters read the pitches. They have benefited from playing a series against a top-class team. They will benefit from this in the Champions Trophy.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

What does Shubman Gill's horoscope say about his captaincy future

NEW DELHI: Former India pacer Zaheer Khan has expressed concerns over head coach Gautam Gambhir 's flexible approach in white-ball cricket , cautioning that it could lead to uncertainty among players. Zaheer's remarks come amid India's frequent experimentation with batting positions in the ongoing limited-overs series against England.India have shuffled their opening combinations and No. 3 batter in almost every match. While the T20I opening duo of Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma remained constant, the ODI setup has seen frequent changes. In the first ODI, Yashasvi Jaiswal partnered Rohit Sharma at the top, a move later clarified by Shreyas Iyer as a pre-planned strategy rather than a necessity due to Virat Kohli 's unavailability. However, with Kohli's return for the second ODI, Jaiswal was dropped, and Shubman Gill was promoted to open alongside Rohit.Speaking on, Zaheer emphasised that while flexibility is important, it must come with clear guidelines to ensure stability within the squad.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 ""You've said that you've got to have flexibility. Number one and two will be there, but the others are going to be flexible. Within that flexibility, some rules also apply. There are certain protocols you have to follow. Certain communication needs to happen, which is gonna streamline things. Otherwise, you are creating insecurity, which, at some stage, will come back and hurt you. You don't want it to be the case. So you've got to be prepared to deal with that situation,"" Zaheer said.The former left-arm pacer stressed that for Gambhir’s strategy to work, there must be absolute clarity between the coach, captain, selectors, and players.""That's why I said recency bias is something very strong right now. The situation has become dynamic if you have to compare Rahul Dravid's approach and Gautam Gambhir's approach. You can say it's good, bad, or ugly, or you can say how do we adapt? Each individual is a part of this system, be it the senior management or the think tank, be it the players, be it the selectors. They will have to gauge it, and the entire system needs to be streamlined for the wheel to turn properly,"" Zaheer added.Also See: Champions Trophy Fixtures 2025 As Team India continues to fine-tune its squad ahead of the Champions Trophy , the balance between experimentation and stability will be crucial in determining the team’s success.",Zaheer Khan has expressed concerns over head coach Gautam Gambhir's flexible approach in white-ball cricket.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan captain Salman Butt has come out in strong support of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) amid the controversy surrounding Rachin Ravindra's injury during the ongoing tri-series in Pakistan.The incident occurred in the first ODI between Pakistan and New Zealand at Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium , where Ravindra suffered a gruesome injury while attempting a catch. The New Zealand all-rounder failed to spot the ball in the field and was struck flush on his head, leading to heavy bleeding. He had to leave the ground immediately, his face covered with a towel, while fans questioned the quality of the newly installed floodlights at the venue.However, Butt refuted these claims, holding Ravindra responsible for the unfortunate accident. Speaking on a local news channel, Butt said, ""There's no point trying to make people understand when they don't want to. It's irrelevant. These are some of the latest LED lights that have been installed, so these are fine. When New Zealand players hit sixes off deliveries bowled at close to 150 kph, were the lights not working then? A player who was standing 70 meters away failed to take the catch because of his misjudgment. He is a fine fielder, but perhaps his leg slipped, and he got hurt.""Despite New Zealand Cricket 's official statement confirming that Ravindra suffered a laceration on his forehead, requiring stitches, Butt maintained that the mishap was purely a result of player miscalculation rather than any fault of the stadium infrastructure.Also Read: 2025 Champions Trophy The controversy was further highlighted when the 2nd ODI between India and England at Cuttack's Barabati Stadium witnessed a 30-minute delay due to floodlight malfunction . The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) faced a similar public backlash, with the Odisha Cricket Association being asked to provide an explanation. This parallel incident raised concerns about stadium management and lighting standards across cricketing nations.","Former Pakistan captain Salman Butt has come out in strong support of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) amid the controversy surrounding Rachin Ravindra's injury.

'Everyone played a part': Captain Rashid Khan as MI Cape Town clinch maiden SA20 title

Brief Scores:

Mumbai: 315 and 278/4 in 67 overs (Ajinkya Rahane 88 batting, Suryakumar Yadav 70, Siddhesh Lad 43, Shivam Dube 30 batting) vs Haryana 301 in 84.5 overs (Ankit Kumar 136, Yashvardhan Dalal 36; Shardul Thakur 6/58). Mumbai lead by 292 runs.

NEW DELHI: Suryakumar Yadav roared back to form with a fluent 70, forging a match-defining 129-run partnership with Ajinkya Rahane (88*), as defending champions Mumbai tightened their grip over Haryana on day three of their Ranji Trophy quarterfinal in Kolkata on Monday.Their commanding batting display, following Shardul Thakur ’s sensational six-wicket haul in the morning, propelled Mumbai to 278/4 in 67 overs at stumps, extending their lead to a formidable 292 runs.Rahane, composed and steady, remained unbeaten on 88 off 142 balls, striking 10 boundaries, while Suryakumar lit up the innings with his trademark aggressive strokeplay. The Indian T20I skipper’s 86-ball knock featured eight fours and two sixes, including audacious reverse hits and elegant drives that put Mumbai firmly in control.Earlier in the day, Mumbai’s pace spearhead Shardul Thakur (18.5-3-58-6) dismantled Haryana’s lower order, wrapping up their innings for 301 within the first hour of play. Despite a slender 14-run first-innings lead, Mumbai’s bowlers had ensured a psychological edge.Spin duo Shams Mulani and Tanush Kotian chipped in with two wickets each, complementing Shardul’s fiery spell.However, Mumbai’s second innings began on a shaky note. Openers Akash Anand (10) and Ayush Mhatre (31) fell cheaply, while Siddhesh Lad (43) failed to convert his start, falling to Jayant Yadav’s off-spin. At 116/3, Mumbai needed stability—enter Rahane and Suryakumar.Desperate for runs after a string of low scores, Suryakumar started aggressively, racing to 28 off 23 balls. He tore apart Sumit Kumar with three boundaries in quick succession—one lofted straight down the ground, another sliced past the cordon, and the third cut crisply through point.His half-century, his first 50-plus score in 14 innings across formats, was a much-needed confidence boost. Coming off a dismal T20I series against England (where he managed just 28 runs in five innings), Suryakumar was determined to turn things around. His recent struggles included a highest score of 20 in the Vijay Hazare Trophy and a mere 7 in his only Ranji Trophy appearance this season.However, just as he looked set for a big score, Suryakumar perished in the final hour, mistiming a hook off rookie pacer Anuj Thakral. The ball ballooned to mid-on, cutting short his promising innings.While Suryakumar entertained, Rahane remained the anchor. The veteran reached his third fifty of the season, his second consecutive, with a pull shot over mid-wicket off Nishant Sindhu. He followed it up with a well-timed cut behind point, further solidifying Mumbai’s dominance.As stumps were drawn, Rahane stood tall at 88*, ensuring Mumbai remained in complete control and setting up a daunting fourth-innings chase for Haryana.Mumbai had set the tone early in the morning, with Shardul striking in the very first over. Haryana’s overnight batter Rohit Sharma (22) top-edged a pull shot, sending a simple catch to Mohit Avasthi at deep fine leg.Jayant Yadav survived momentarily after successfully reviewing an LBW decision, but Shardul soon had his man. With the lower order exposed, he tightened the screws further.Anshul Kamboj misjudged an incoming delivery and was trapped LBW after a successful DRS appeal overturned the on-field decision. Shardul fittingly completed his six-wicket haul by dismissing Ajit Chahal for a golden duck, ending Haryana’s resistance.With a commanding lead and Rahane well-set, Mumbai now holds the upper hand, eyeing a strong finish to secure a semifinal berth.",Mumbai lead Haryana by 292 runs at stumps on day three of Ranji Trophy quarterfinal in Kolkata. Suryakumar Yadav (70) and Ajinkya Rahane (88) put on 129-run partnership for second wicket. Shardul Thakur (18.5-3-58-6) took six wickets for Mumbai in first hour of play.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118118771,imgsize-26432,width-400,resizemode-4/118118771.jpg"

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

NEW DELHI: Former India batter Suresh Raina has confidently claimed that Rohit Sharma ’s 33rd ODI century is just around the corner after the Indian skipper stormed back into form with a scintillating knock against England in Cuttack.Rohit, who was under scrutiny due to a lean patch, silenced his critics with an explosive performance in the second ODI of the series. After a lackluster dismissal in the first ODI, the Indian captain came out with a renewed sense of aggression in Cuttack, dismantling the English bowling attack with precision.The Indian skipper reached his 32nd hundred in just 76 balls, smashing 12 boundaries and 7 sixes in a spectacular display of strokeplay. His innings of 119 runs, off 90 balls, played a crucial role in India's four-wicket victory. Speaking to Star Sports, Raina showered praise on Rohit's approach, particularly his footwork against the spinners.""That 69m six, the first shot - it deserves some commentary! My voice is already fading, but that flow, that signature of a great player, was evident. Look at all those shots in the ‘V’! He used his footwork brilliantly against the spinners. He played fewer dot balls after each boundary and six, focusing more on rotation,"" Raina remarked.Raina had earlier predicted that Rohit would find form in Cuttack following his struggles in Nagpur. The former cricketer emphasised that great players like Rohit don’t wait for the final game of a series to make an impact, ensuring the job is done early.""I had already said in the show that it was Rohit’s day. There was a different vibe in Cuttack, the fielding was sharp, and that’s how big players are - they win the series today, and they won’t leave Ahmedabad without seizing another opportunity. That 33rd century is also loading - I’m telling you!"" said Raina.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 With the series already clinched, all eyes are on the final ODI against England on Wednesday in Ahmedabad, where Rohit has a chance to convert Raina's prophecy into reality.""He enjoyed the situation. Whenever Rohit Sharma plays, we always feel that if he bats for 20-25 overs, then the match is in our hands. He has flawless technique, the best timer of the ball. I think when he is in his zone, there’s no one better than him in the world,"" Raina concluded, reaffirming his belief in India's captain.","Suresh Raina believes Rohit Sharma's 33rd ODI century is just around the corner.

NEW DELHI: Indian cricketer Riyan Parag recently addressed the controversy surrounding his YouTube search history that went viral following the IPL 2024 .During an interview with City1016 Radio station, Parag recalled the moment when he realised his search history had been accidentally revealed on a live stream, sparking a social media frenzy.""I finished the IPL, we were in Chennai, finished the match, got on a Discord call with my streaming team, and it got publicised now, but it happened before the IPL. One of the people in my Discord team tried to set me up before the IPL, but that got taken down very quickly. But then after the IPL, the hype was there, and I had a good season. I came and opened my stream, I didn't have Spotify or Apple Music. Everything was deleted,"" Parag explained.""So I went on YouTube to put on music, and I searched for music. But I didn't know what was happening, but once I did the stream ended, I was like Oh s**t! This happened. It just got blown out of proportion. I didn't think it was good enough a reason for me to go out publicly and clarify everything and no one would understand,"" he added.Parag faced widespread criticism and mockery after fans noticed explicit searches related to Bollywood actresses Ananya Panday and Sara Ali Khan Despite the backlash, he took the incident in stride and focused on his career.Meanwhile, Parag has been making history on the cricket field.

India:

England:

NEW DELHI: Team India will be hoping for a series clean-sweep of England as well as a big knock from Virat Kohli 's currently silent bat when the two teams play the third and final ODI in Ahmedabad on Wednesday, the end of their Champions Trophy build-up.India have won each of the first two ODIs by identical four-wicket margins, giving them an insurmountable 2-0 lead. However, Rohit Sharma 's team will be especially motivated to win at the Narendra Modi Stadium, where they lost the 2023 ODI World Cup final.Naturally, a victory with their batting stalwart, Kohli, among runs would be the ideal way to round off the home team's Champions Trophy preparations. According to a hybrid hosting format, the eight-team competition begins on February 19 in Karachi, with India playing Bangladesh the next day in Dubai.Rohit's return to form has already given the team a boost. After a protracted sequence of low scores, his 90-ball 119 in the second ODI was a welcome relief to him and the team.Though he hasn't remained at the crease long enough to give himself a chance for a big innings, Kohli hasn't appeared wholly out of touch.Kohli has a chance to set yet another record if he can click. In what has been perhaps the run-machine's favorite format, he is just 89 runs away from being just the third batter in history to reach 14,000 runs.As they continue to utilize their vast talent pool, India doesn't appear to have made a mistake in this series. Mohammed Shami 's comeback from a protracted injury layoff has also gone smoothly, and the arrival of Varun Chakravarthy has strengthened their deadly spin assault, which will be essential for the Champions Trophy Given that the Indian team management would be anxiously awaiting word on the availability of their star fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah for the Champions Trophy on Tuesday, Shami's triumphant return has undoubtedly been reassuring.Bumrah was supposed to make a return in the Ahmedabad ODI according to the original schedule, but the star pacer is now working hard at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru under the close supervision of experts in hopes of making the final team that will be announced on Wednesday.No team in the world can match Bumrah's skill on a variety of wickets and situations, and India will be itching to regain their trump card as they aim to win another ICC championship.In order to rest and recover, India and England have foregone training and other pre-match procedures, so they will both get Tuesday off.Rohit's confidence will undoubtedly spread to the rest of the team after he concluded his problematic batting streak with a signature hundred in Cuttack.India would anticipate improved performance and application from wicketkeeper-batter KL Rahul, who is currently experiencing a lean period, even though Yashasvi Jaiswal may continue to warm the bench.However, it wouldn't be shocking if India give the flamboyant Rishabh Pant a chance to play and added another left-handed batsman to the lineup to experiment with different combinations.India will require Shreyas Iyer's middle-order presence, which has been strengthened by Axar Patel's strong batting displays. With performances of 52 and 41 not out in the two ODIs thus far, the 31-year-old all-rounder has demonstrated tremendous maturity at No. 5 under pressure. Ravindra Jadeja , who has so far chipped away at England with six wickets, has been relieved of some of the load by Patel's batting exploits. Jadeja has taken advantage of the spin-friendly circumstances to get ready for similar setups in the Champions Trophy.However, this tour has brought up more questions than Jos Butter's England would have anticipated.The outstanding work that the opening duo of Phil Salt and Ben Duckett has been doing has been undone by England's many implosions in their core batting lineup throughout the T20Is and ODIs.Buttler says his squad is still improving, but they are further hampered by the injury that forced the exit of the promising Jacob Bethell.Joe Root's remarkable results have not had enough help from others, and Harry Brook has fluctuated greatly in the best batting conditions.Adil Rashid has taken full advantage of the conditions as a bowler, but it will be up to the England hitters to put on a cohesive display.Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill (vc), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Rishabh Pant (wk), Hardik Pandya , Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd.

'ILT20 is great for UAE cricket': Sehwag anticipates thrilling finale

Team India Squad for ICC Men's Champions Trophy 2025

NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah is all set to commence his rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru after he underwent scans and thorough assessment under the watch of Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) medical team. It is reliably learnt that the reports were internally discussed and now the seamer is likely to start physical activity - some gym work, even light bowling - in the next 24-48 hours.The International Cricket Council (ICC) deadline to make changes to Champions Trophy provisional squad is a couple of days away - February 11 midnight Dubai time as the support period starts February 12 - and it will not be a surprise if the Indian cricket board plays the waiting game with Bumrah. They followed a similar route even when Hardik Pandya was injured during the group stages of the 2023 ODI World Cup.""Even if there is a 1% chance, the BCCI is likely to wait. They did the same with Hardik Pandya as they waited for close to two weeks before getting Prasidh Krishna as a replacement. Even when Shubman Gill was down with dengue, they didn't have any thoughts of looking for a replacement. Yes those two incidents happened during the campaign but approach with Bumrah could well be no different. This is just the deadline to submit the squad and they could approach the Event Technical Committee at a later stage to seek a replacement if he fails to regain fitness,"" says a source close to developments.India's ace seamer was asked to off-load for five weeks after the Sydney Test vs Australia where he injured himself and didn't come out to bowl in the second innings. Since then, there has been no proper update from the BCCI on the nature and extent of his injury, and suspense around his return to competitive cricket has continued.Bumrah was named in the ODI squad for ongoing series vs England but his name was missing from the squad sheet when Varun Chakaravarthy was added to the set-up. With Harshit Rana already there and Varun added to the ODI squad, the Indian team management is clearly keeping the options ready if Bumrah doesn't get the all-clear from the NCA in time for the multi-nation tournament which starts on February 19.India captain Rohit Sharma had said that Varun, who even made his debut in the 2nd ODI, is also very much in contention.“Clearly during the series it presents us an opportunity to play him at some stage and see what he is capable of. Right now we are not thinking about whether we are going to take him or not but definitely he will be in contention. If things plan out really well for us and he does what is required then definitely there is something that we need to think about,” Rohit had said during the pre-series media interaction.Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill (vc), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja","Jasprit Bumrah is all set to commence his rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru. The seamer is likely to start physical activity - some gym work, even light bowling - in the next 24-48 hours. The International Cricket Council (ICC) deadline to make changes to Champions Trophy provisional squad is a couple of days away.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118095310,imgsize-38514,width-400,resizemode-4/118095310.jpg"

Jasprit Bumrah out of Champions Trophy as team management takes no chances,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-2025/jasprit-bumrah-out-of-champions-trophy-as-team-management-takes-no-chances/articleshow/118159679.cms,"Decision after chief selector, captain & head coach meet in Ahmedabad following differing medical opinions on pacer

Squad for ICC Champions Trophy:

Non-travelling substitutes (will travel to Dubai as and when required):

NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah has been ruled out of the upcoming Champions Trophy due to injury, the Indian cricket board (BCCI) announced on Tuesday night.Earlier in the day, captain Rohit Sharma , head coach Gautam Gambhir and chief selector Ajit Agarkar got together for a meeting in Ahmedabad, venue for the third ODI against England, to take a call on whether they wanted to risk Bumrah for the ICC tournament or opt for a replacement.Bumrah was named in the provisional squad and the deadline for making changes to the squad was Tuesday midnight. Harshit Rana has been named as his replacement. Rana has been playing in the ongoing ODI series against England and has been given game time ahead of Arshdeep Singh.Interestingly, Yashashvi Jaiswal has been omitted from the team to make way for 'mystery spinner' Varun Chakravarthy. Jaiswal, Mohammed Siraj and Shivam Dube have been named as 'non-travelling substitutes'.TOI has learnt that the indecision over Bumrah stemmed from two different verdicts from Bumrah's orthopedic surgeon in New Zealand and the BCCI's own medical team. Dr Rowan Schouten in New Zealand was of the opinion that Bumrah could try resuming high-intensity activities while the BCCI medical team was unsure if the ace pace bowler should be rushed back to international cricket.""Schouten is aware of Bumrah's case history. He is not averse to Bumrah playing and trying himself out. However, the BCCI medical team has observed that a few 'hot spots' still persist in scans of his back. The BCCI team was very wary about giving a definite green signal. Tuesday's meeting between Rohit, Gambhir and Agarkar revolved around this,"" a BCCI source told TOI.""There is also an argument that Bumrah has always had 'hot spots' in his back and still played. It was also up to Bumrah to feel confident about his back before taking the chance. There's a lot of important cricket coming later in the year,"" said the source.Agarkar had mentioned on Jan 18 that the selection committee was hopeful Bumrah would be available for the last ODI against England on Wednesday, but that eventually didn't happen.There were also discussions around Bumrah going through his rehab on tour with two physios travelling with the team, but these ideas were also discarded.The team management was also keen to get Varun Chakravarthy in the scheme of things. Chakravarthy played in the last ODI instead of Kuldeep Yadav to give him game time in ODI cricket. Yet, it was difficult to draft him in as a direct replacement for Bumrah. The selectors decided to retain Kuldeep and Washington Sundar but they had to drop Jaiswal to accommodate both Rana and Chakravarthy.Rohit Sharma (captain), Shubman Gill (vice-captain), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Rishabh Pant (wk), Hardik Pandya , Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Ravindra Jadeja , Varun ChakaravarthyYashasvi Jaiswal, Mohammed Siraj, Shivam Dube",Jasprit Bumrah has been ruled out of the upcoming Champions Trophy due to injury.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh’s Shohely Akhter made history for the wrong reasons on Tuesday, becoming the first female cricketer to be banned by the ICC for corruption.The 36-year-old off-spinner received a five-year suspension after being found guilty of attempting to fix matches during the 2023 Women's T20 World Cup .Shohely, who played two ODIs and 13 T20Is for Bangladesh, admitted to violating five provisions of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code . The charges stemmed from her attempts to corrupt matches during the tournament in South Africa, despite not being part of Bangladesh’s squad at the time.The ICC’s Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) uncovered Shohely’s involvement through conversations on Facebook Messenger, where she approached a teammate — identified as ‘Player A’ — before Bangladesh’s match against Australia on February 14, 2023.She offered her teammate 2 million Bangladeshi Taka to get out hit wicket, claiming the money would come from her ‘cousin,’ who was involved in illegal betting.Despite promising secrecy and urging her teammate to delete their messages, the approached player refused the offer and immediately reported the incident to the ACU, providing voice notes as evidence.Shohely, who had deleted the messages on her end, ultimately admitted to breaching Articles 2.1.1, 2.1.3, 2.1.4, 2.4.4, and 2.4.7 of the ICC Code.Her ban, effective from February 10, 2025, marks a significant moment in cricket's fight against corruption, reinforcing the importance of reporting and vigilance within the game.",Shohely Akhter is the first female cricketer to be banned by the ICC for corruption.

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday unveiled the renovated National Stadium in Karachi, one of the three venues set to host the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy To mark the occasion, PCB recognised the relentless efforts of 700 workers—including laborers, engineers, technicians, and loaders—who worked tirelessly to complete the upgrades.The historic stadium will stage the tournament’s opening match between Pakistan and New Zealand on February 19, as well as a tri-series fixture between Pakistan and South Africa on Wednesday, followed by the final on February 14.After undergoing renovations for the past four months, the stadium now boasts a state-of-the-art building at its far end, new LED floodlights, two large screens, and improved spectator facilities.The upgraded infrastructure includes modern dressing rooms, exclusive spaces for broadcasters and match officials, and premium hospitality boxes.Despite the modernization, the stadium retains its traditional aesthetic. However, the placement of a larger screen has obstructed views from certain enclosures. Project manager Mohsin Chohan confirmed that the screen would be relocated after the tournament.Initially, PCB allocated 4 billion Pakistan rupees for the renovation, but the final costs have exceeded projections, with some finishing touches expected to continue post-Champions Trophy.","The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday unveiled the renovated National Stadium in Karachi.

NEW DELHI: Veteran India batter Ajinkya Rahane reaffirmed his love for Test cricket and his hunger for a national comeback after leading Mumbai to the Ranji Trophy semifinals with a stunning century against Haryana. The 36-year-old, who last played a Test for India in July 2023, has been in red-hot form in domestic cricket across formats this season.""There's still cricket left in me,"" Rahane declared after Mumbai's 152-run win. ""Domestic cricket has given me everything, and my passion for the game remains strong. I respect Test cricket and will always give my best.""Rahane’s performances this season have been remarkable. In his last 10 innings, he has registered three 90-plus scores, an 80-plus knock, and now a century in the quarterfinals.His form in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and his leadership in the Ranji Trophy have kept him in contention for a possible India recall. ""I always play with a positive attitude and give more than 100 percent. Whatever happens in the future, no one can stop it,"" he said.With India's next Test assignment against England in June, Rahane refused to speculate about a potential comeback. ""That’s still a long time away. Right now, my focus is on the Ranji Trophy semifinals.""Despite being overlooked in India's Test squad, he remains motivated. ""If you are not hungry, then there is nothing inside. The fire inside me is still alive.""With Shreyas Iyer released by KKR and leading Punjab Kings, the captaincy role for Kolkata Knight Riders remains vacant. While Rahane and Venkatesh Iyer are seen as frontrunners, the veteran batter denied any discussions about the role.""No such talks have taken place yet. If it happens, you’ll probably know before me!"" he said with a smile. However, he asserted that he is prepared for leadership responsibilities if the opportunity arises.""I have captained before, played in different conditions, and handled responsibility. As a leader, my goal is to bring out the best in my teammates and help them perform as a unit.""With BCCI mandating that senior players participate in domestic cricket, Rahane supported the decision, stating that it benefits young cricketers and strengthens Indian cricket.""We all came through domestic cricket, and playing here gives us valuable game time. The BCCI has made a great decision, and I believe this rule is helping Indian cricket grow.""For now, Rahane remains focused on Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy campaign, determined to lead his team to glory while keeping his dream of a Test comeback alive.

NEW DELHI: Rising Proteas star Matthew Breetzke would have keenly observed Kane Williamson during their time together at Durban Super Giants in the recently concluded SA20 .While Breetzke and DSG's performance fell short of expectations, the SA20 provided valuable opportunities for young South African players to learn from experienced players like Williamson.Breetzke recently marked his Proteas ODI debut with a record-breaking 150 against Williamson's Black Caps in Lahore.“I obviously take pride in my white ball cricket, and I've done nicely in T20 cricket, but obviously in one-day cricket that's probably the best I've batted,” Breetzke said.“Yeah, it hasn't really settled in yet. I think once I get on my phone and chat to my family. I think it will settle in quite nicely.”DSG teammates Wiaan Mulder and Jason Smith contributed significantly, scoring 64 and 41 respectively in South Africa's total of 304 for 6.Williamson responded with an unbeaten 133, leading New Zealand to a six-wicket victory.“South Africa played really well off the back of Matthew Breetzke with an outstanding knock and so we knew going into the second half that the surface was good and we're going to have to put together partnerships which we were able to do,” Williamson said.Breetzke displayed similar composure to Williamson early in his innings when New Zealand's seamers found assistance from the conditions and the green pitch. Run-scoring was challenging initially, with survival being the main focus.Breetzke endured several hits to his body and fingers, particularly from Will O'Rourke's rising deliveries, before flourishing as conditions improved.“I think the wicket was definitely tacky and the over-air conditions with a bit of mist in the air, it was tough for the new ball.“So, yeah, my mindset was just to get through those first ten with that new ball and then hopefully kick on and luckily it paid off.”","Matthew Breetzke scored 150 on his Proteas ODI debut against New Zealand.

NEW DELHI: Seamer Nachiket Bhute ’s fiery three-wicket spell and Yash Rathod ’s composed century powered Vidarbha to a commanding 198-run victory over Tamil Nadu , securing a spot in the Ranji Trophy semifinals on day four in Nagpur on Tuesday.Bhute was instrumental in dismantling Tamil Nadu’s top order, returning figures of 3/19 in 10 overs, while Rathod’s patient 112 off 213 balls anchored Vidarbha’s second innings, ensuring a daunting target of 401.Chasing 401, Tamil Nadu’s formidable batting lineup crumbled, reduced to 45/5 by the end of day three. Bhute led the charge, dismissing key batters Narayan Jagadeesan (18), Vijay Shankar (5), and Boopathi Kumar (0) in quick succession.Despite a battling 53 off 95 balls from Pradosh Ranjan Paul and a fighting 57 off 84 deliveries from Sonu Yadav, Tamil Nadu fell well short, getting bowled out for 202 in 61.1 overs. Left-arm spinner Harsh Dubey (3/40) wrapped up the innings, taking the last three wickets to seal Vidarbha’s emphatic victory.Vidarbha started day four with a 297-run lead and added another 103 runs before being bowled out for 272 in 92.3 overs. Rathod, resuming unbeaten on 55, continued his measured innings to notch up his fifth first-class century, guiding Vidarbha to a massive 400-run advantage.His crucial 120-run partnership with Harsh Dubey (64) helped steady the innings after early setbacks. Though Tamil Nadu managed to take the final five wickets, the damage had already been done.Tamil Nadu’s second innings mirrored their first, with wickets tumbling early. Right-arm pacer Aditya Thakare struck first, removing Mohammed Ali for 10, before Bhute ripped through the middle order.Pradosh Ranjan’s fifty provided brief resistance, but his dismissal signaled the end for Tamil Nadu. Sonu Yadav’s determined half-century only delayed the inevitable, as Vidarbha’s bowlers wrapped up the match clinically.With this comprehensive win, last season’s runners-up continued their dominant run in the tournament, marching into the semifinals in style.",Vidarbha beat Tamil Nadu by 198 runs on day four of Ranji Trophy match.

Mathys Tel scored a late consolation for Spurs, but it was too little, too late.The 2-1 loss in the fourth round came on the back of an exit from the English League Cup semifinals after a 4-0 second-leg humbling at Liverpool on Thursday.Plymouth's victory over Liverpool is considered one of the greatest giant-killings in FA Cup history.The Argyle, managed by Miron Muslic, a former refugee from war-torn Bosnia, had already beaten Premier League side Brentford in the previous round and secured their first league win since November against West Brom.Slot acknowledged Liverpool's underwhelming performance, stating, ""We were not having a very good day. A result like this is the outcome."" Muslic, on the other hand, expressed his delight, calling it a ""magical day"" for Plymouth.Elsewhere, Wolves cruised into the fifth round with a 2-0 win over Blackburn Rovers, courtesy of goals from Joao Gomes and Matheus Cunha within 39 seconds of each other.The FA Cup exits for Liverpool and Tottenham have ended their hopes of achieving a quadruple and winning silverware this season, respectively.

Liverpool suffered a humiliating FA Cup exit as Championship strugglers Plymouth ended their quadruple hopes with a stunning 1-0 victory in the fourth round on Sunday.Arne Slot ’s decision to field a weakened team backfired spectacularly, with Ryan Hardie’s second-half penalty securing Plymouth’s memorable triumph at Home Park.Slot made 10 changes from the side that dominated Tottenham 4-0 in the League Cup semi-final second leg, resting key players like Virgil van Dijk Mohamed Salah , Andrew Robertson, and Cody Gakpo. However, the gamble proved costly, marking a rare misstep in an otherwise stellar debut season for the former Feyenoord boss.Liverpool’s fourth defeat across all competitions this season also represented only the third time they had failed to score under Slot. More significantly, it was just the fourth instance of a Premier League leader being knocked out of the FA Cup by a lower-division club.The Reds must now regroup quickly ahead of the Merseyside derby against Everton at Goodison Park on Wednesday. A victory there would extend their lead over second-placed Arsenal to nine points in the title race. Meanwhile, they remain contenders in the Champions League last 16 and will face Newcastle in the League Cup final in March.Plymouth manager Miron Muslic masterminded one of the FA Cup’s greatest giant-killings while battling to lift his team from the bottom of the Championship. Muslic, a refugee from war-torn Bosnia, moved to Austria at the age of nine after fleeing his besieged hometown of Bihac in 1992.Having already eliminated Premier League side Brentford in the third round, Plymouth entered the match buoyed by their first league victory since November, a 3-2 win over West Brom. Their determined display against Liverpool will go down in FA Cup history.Playing under a wintry sun on the Devon coast, Liverpool’s under-strength squad suffered an early blow when Joe Gomez limped off injured in the first half. The Reds struggled to generate attacking momentum, with Plymouth’s relentless energy frustrating their efforts.James McConnell’s long-range strike in the 36th minute forced a save from Conor Hazard, but Liverpool otherwise lacked cutting edge.The breakthrough came in the 54th minute when Darko Gyabi’s overhead kick struck Harvey Elliott’s raised arm, leading to a clear penalty. Hardie calmly sent Caoimhin Kelleher the wrong way to put Plymouth ahead.Late pressure from Liverpool saw Diogo Jota and Darwin Nunez denied by superb saves from Hazard, as Home Park erupted in celebration at the final whistle.Elsewhere in the FA Cup, Wolves secured a 2-0 win at Blackburn, scoring twice in 39 seconds. Joao Gomes’ shot slipped past Balazs Toth in the 33rd minute, before Matheus Cunha’s blistering strike doubled the lead moments later.Struggling just two points above the Premier League relegation zone, Wolves welcomed the distraction of cup success as they advanced to the fifth round.Meanwhile, Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou faces mounting pressure ahead of their clash against Aston Villa. Having previously claimed he always wins a trophy in his second season, the Australian manager is running out of opportunities to keep that promise if Spurs exit the FA Cup.",Plymouth beat Liverpool 1-0 in the fourth round of the FA Cup. Ryan Hardie scored the only goal of the game from the penalty spot. It was just the fourth time a Premier League leader was knocked out by a lower-division club.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118094656,imgsize-57208,width-400,resizemode-4/118094656.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe 's timely strike secured a hard-fought 1-1 draw for Real Madrid against their fierce rivals Atletico Madrid in a tense La Liga encounter on Saturday.The result maintained Los Blancos' slender one-point lead over Atletico at the top of the table, while also keeping Barcelona within striking distance in third place.The match was a closely contested affair, with both sides displaying their defensive resilience and intensity. Atletico drew first blood in the first half through Julian Alvarez 's controversial penalty, which was awarded after a VAR review for a clumsy challenge by Aurelien Tchouameni on Samuel Lino.Alvarez coolly converted the spot-kick with a cheeky Panenka, much to the frustration of the Real Madrid faithful, who vented their anger towards the officials.However, Real Madrid responded swiftly in the second half, with Mbappe pouncing on a rebound from Jude Bellingham 's blocked shot to level the scores. The French striker's goal on his debut in the heated derby clash underlined his importance to the team and his ability to deliver in crucial moments.The second half saw Real Madrid take control of the proceedings, with Bellingham twice coming agonizingly close to putting his side ahead. The England international's headed efforts were denied by the woodwork and a fine save from Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak, who also produced crucial stops to deny Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, and Mbappe.Despite their dominance, Real Madrid could not find the elusive winner, leaving both teams to settle for a share of the spoils. The result left Carlo Ancelotti 's side clinging to their narrow lead at the summit, while Atletico will rue their inability to capitalize on their first-half advantage.In his post-match comments, Ancelotti acknowledged his team's disappointment at not securing all three points but expressed satisfaction with their continued leadership of the league.""The team is disappointed because they think they deserved more... but we're happy because we're still leaders,"" Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told reporters. ""In the second half we had total control, we had a lot of chances.""Atletico coach Diego Simeone , on the other hand, lamented his side's lack of composure in front of goal, particularly in the first half.""We had a good first half, but we weren't relaxed enough in front of goal to (score) more,"" said Simeone. ""In the end it was a draw in which both teams think they could have taken more from it.""The hard-fought draw sets the stage for an intriguing midweek clash, as Real Madrid prepare to face Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League play-off round.Meanwhile, the La Liga title race remains delicately poised, with Barcelona given an opportunity to close the gap on the top two when they face Sevilla on Sunday.",Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid draw 1-1 in La Liga derby on Saturday.

Enzo Maresca, Chelsea's interim manager, lamented the lack of VAR but acknowledged the result's consequences.""I think the handball is quite clear. Without VAR it's complicated,"" Maresca said.""The second half the only shots they had we conceded a goal from. We had a few chances at 2-1. But you have to take the consequence of the result.""At Brisbane Road, Manchester City found themselves trailing after Jamie Donley's long-range effort deflected off goalkeeper Stefan Ortega and into the net.The champions eventually equalized through Abdukodir Khusanov's deflected strike before De Bruyne's late intervention secured their passage to the next round.Pep Guardiola praised the FA Cup's unpredictability and the atmosphere generated by the Orient faithful, although he expressed concern over the injury sustained by new signing Nico Gonzalez.""It was a typical FA Cup game, that is why this competition is unbelievable.

SHILLONG: Football frenzy was at its peak as the city welcomed Indian Super League and hoped to see NorthEast United FC script a memorable win and star striker Alaaeddine Ajaraie break the league’s goalscoring record at the revamped Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Friday.But while there was no dearth in their support – with a Alaaeddine fan getting into the ground and hugging his hero in the 62nd minute – Juan Pedro Benali’s men could not live up to the expectation as Mumbai City FC won 2-0 with goals from two former NEUFC players – Bipin Singh (41’) and Lallianzuala Chhangte (90+2’).The victory meant that the visitors leapfrogged both NEUFC and Bengaluru FC to go fourth with 31 points from 19 games while the hosts went a rung down to fifth with 29 points from 20 matches.With the fervent northeastern fans behind them, NEUFC started the game with gusto despite the celsius scale tipping to 10 degrees in what might be the coldest ISL fixture this season.It was the hosts, looking to make a winning start in their ‘second home’, who kept pushing ahead and creating moves to break the Mumbai City defence. Jithin MS and Nestor Albiach looked menacing on the left wing as they tried feeding the ball to Alaaeddine in the middle.The cheers of “Alaaeddine, Alaaeddine” around the revamped and upgraded venue appeared to have done the trick in the 8th minute when a Macarton cross reached the Moroccan in the box. However, to the disbelief of the fans, his header went just over the bar.But the constant attacks by NEUFC did not ebb as Petr Kratky’s men maintained a very deep line of defence, led by the in-form Mehtab Singh in the centre. And while NEUFC kept bombarding with attacks, Alaaeddine and Co. were unable to find a breakthrough in the final third.It was against the run of play and from a half chance that the visitors eventually broke the deadlock in the 41st minute.Bipin delayed his run to meet a Fernandez cross inside the box from the right and headed the ball in that dropped before Gurmeet Singh but still ricocheted into the goal for the Mumbai City breakthrough and brought the till-then cheers from the stands to complete silence.Benali’s men tried to regroup fast and restarted their quest to break the Mumbai City defence. But nothing seemed to be working for them as the first half ended with the visitors in the lead.Soon after the change of ends, NEUFC got a free-kick in a dangerous spot outside the box. But Nestor’s shot was easily punched out by Mumbai custodian Purba Lachenpa in the 49th minute. Incessant moves by NEUFC in the Mumbai half, only to find them curtailed by the visitors’ final line of defence continued to be the script for most of the remaining time.The match, which saw seven yellow cards being shown by the referee, was starting to get ill-tempered when it was taken beyond the hosts’ grip by none other than northeast’s very own Chhangte.Getting at the end of a long cross from the Mumbai box by Tiri, skipper Chhangte put his skills on display to beat the NEUFC defenders and send a shot that Gurmeet got a touch to but could not stop from rolling into the goal.",Mumbai City FC won 2-0 with goals from Bipin Singh (41’) and Lallianzuala Chhangte (90+2’).

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

PANAJI: The Derbi Madrileno or Madrid Derby holds plenty of promise. A depleted Real Madrid and a fired up Atletico Madrid are separated by just a point after 22 matches at the top of the Liga table.When the teams met earlier in the season, it ended 1-1, a feisty game that saw Atletico grab a stoppage time equaliser. The return leg could be a potentially season-defining clash at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday, even though Real Madrid are handicapped with several absentees, particularly in defence. Carlo Ancelotti ’s Real are now without Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba, who joined the sick bay alongside right-back Dani Carvajal, regular centre-back Eder Militao and midfielder Eduardo Camavinga.Even a makeshift defence will not dampen Madrid’s enthusiasm at home, feels Diego Forlan, the former Uruguay striker who spent five years at crosstown rivals Atletico (2007-2011) and won the Golden Boot in 2009, during which he scored 32 goals.""I don't think there's any advantage (for Atletico) because of the injuries,"" Forlan told TOI during a global media interaction, arranged by La Liga earlier this week. ""Real Madrid have a deep squad with so much quality. Many important players will be missing, but with a squad that Madrid possess, they are still at the top of the table. Even though they don't have the regular starting XI, I'm sure it's a team that you have to respect, because they will have others (who can dominate).""Forlan scored over 300 goals in a storied career that won him the Golden Ball for the best player at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. At the club level, the Uruguayan striker won the Pichichi Trophy — the award for the top goalscorer in a La Liga season — at both Atletico and Villareal. Yet, when it came to the Madrid Derby, Forlan didn't taste similar success.In his four seasons at Atletico between 2007 and 2011, Forlan played eight Madrid derbies that resulted in seven losses and one draw. The lack of success wasn't Forlan's fault; between 1999 and 2013, Atletico didn't win in 25 meetings with Madrid, until the arrival of Diego Simeone eventually changed their fortunes. ""Well, we were close to winning against Real Madrid on several occasions but lost or drew. That trend has now changed. So, whether you're playing at home or away, I think the Derby is a lot more equal today. They are now playing on more equal footing,"" said Forlan.It is Simeone's arrival at Atletico that has helped restore the balance. In the 41 derbies played since then, Atletico have won 12, drawing 14 and losing 15. Madrid, though, continue to be the giants, so does Atletico have anything to prove to their city rivals or the world?""There's nothing to prove, you know, for a side that has been great for the last 10 years, winning lots of trophies (even) at the European level. They've made it to the final of the UEFA Champions League (losing to Madrid). This is an important derby, like El Clasico. Atletico and Madrid have always had great players, the derbies were spectacular. Today, the stakes are a lot higher since it's being watched all over the world,"" said Forlan.While Madrid are struggling at the back, their attacking players are fit and firing. There's Kylian Mbappe – playing his first derby after missing the first leg -- Rodrygo and Vinicius, all striking form. At the other end, there's Julian Alvarez, Antonio Griezmann and, of course, Simeone's son Giuliano, ""a real fighter with similar characteristics (like his father), one of the best signings.""",Diego Forlan feels the Derbi Madrileno is now similar to El Clasico.

NEW DELHI: Manchester United 's FA Cup defence remained alive as they staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Leicester City 2-1 on Friday night at Old Trafford.The match witnessed a fairytale return for former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy , who was in the opposition dugout as Leicester's interim manager.The first half was a frustrating affair for the home side, as they struggled to create meaningful chances.Leicester took the lead in the 42nd minute through Bobby De Cordova-Reid, who nodded home from close range after Wilfred Ndidi 's initial effort was saved by Andre Onana.United's manager, Ruben Amorim , recognised the need for a change and introduced Alejandro Garnacho at halftime, a move that proved to be a game-changer. The young Argentine winger injected pace and directness into United's attack, causing problems for the Leicester defence.The equaliser arrived midway through the second half when fellow substitute Joshua Zirkzee tapped in from close range after Rasmus Hojlund's flick from Garnacho's cross was blocked.With the momentum firmly in their favour, United pushed for a winner, and it came deep into stoppage time. Harry Maguire rose highest to head home a Bruno Fernandes free-kick, sparking wild celebrations at Old Trafford.While the goal appeared to be offside, the lack of VAR in the FA Cup meant the decision stood, and United secured a hard-fought victory.The match held added significance for Ruud van Nistelrooy, who had enjoyed a brief spell as United's interim manager earlier in the season following the sacking of Erik ten Hag.During his tenure, United had scored eight goals in two games against Leicester, but this time, the Dutchman was on the receiving end of a United comeback.For United, the win provided a much-needed boost after a recent run of poor form at home, where they had suffered five defeats in their previous seven matches across all competitions.The absence of key players like Lisandro Martinez, who sustained a cruciate ligament injury against Crystal Palace, and the January departures of Marcus Rashford and Antony, had left United light in attacking options.However, the introduction of Garnacho and Zirkzee's impact highlighted the depth in United's squad.As the FA Cup defence continues, United will take confidence from their ability to grind out a result against a determined Leicester side. The comeback victory not only kept their hopes of silverware alive but also provided a timely reminder of the resilience and fighting spirit that has been a hallmark of successful United teams throughout their illustrious history.","Manchester United staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Leicester City 2-1 on Friday night at Old Trafford.

looks to a 15-year-old now

PUNE: A little over two years ago, Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi lost in straight sets in the quarterfinals of a Grade 3 ITF junior event in Pune. ""I don't lose often. Maybe I will win it next year,"" Maaya, then just 13, had declared. Twelve months later, she did exactly that.Any lingering apprehensions were swept away at last week's Mumbai Open, a WTA 125 event. Unranked a week earlier, the 15-year-old Coimbatore girl now appears on the WTA charts at No. 646, putting her in the top-20 of highest ranking achieved on debut. The list includes Jennifer Capriati, Gabriela Sabatini, Monica Seles and the Williams sisters, among others.The teenager's arrival already spells hope for a beleaguered Indian tennis scene - starved of success, battered by apathy of the officialdom, and a court case against the national body.Imran Mirza, who once famously nurtured a prodigy, is very impressed. ""Her temperament is the most impressive part,"" Mirza, father-coach to Sania, told TOI, ""She seemed very level-headed. That's something one needs to go to the highest level.""We put a lot of pressure in India. With Sania, that was one thing we had to always control, the kind of external pressure there was,"" explained Mirza. ""There's already so much excitement with that one performance. She has a long way to go. We have to make sure she's not pressured into thinking that she's the only (one).""According to Imran, Maaya's parents - father Rajeshwaran who deals in procurement of construction raw materials, and mother Revathi, who co-owns a small business - are best placed to nurture her temperament. ""A child is bothered about what the parents think, not what the whole world thinks. Once the fear of losing comes in, it's very difficult to remove that,"" he said.Maaya's mentality reflects in her aggressive game. Even at 13, she wouldn't hesitate to put away a moonball.Manoj Kumar, coach since she was 10, said, ""We impressed upon her that to compete with the world's best juniors, she needed to be aggressive and at the same time become a bit more consistent.""Kumar underlined that Maaya was yet to complete her junior career. ""She hasn't yet transitioned into the women's circuit. She has done well in one tournament, she needs to do it regularly,"" he said.Transition to the pros has always proved the biggest hurdle in Indian tennis. Maaya seems to come well prepared. A little over five-feet-seven in her shoes, she has a good couple of more years to grow, putting on four kgs of muscle mass over the past year. ""I eat like a beast,"" she said recently.With the Rafa Nadal Academy offering her a one-year scholarship, the Indian is in a group of four players who are monitored by two head coaches and assistants. Last month, Miguel Fragoso accompanied her for junior events in India, but she can also summon the familiarity of Kumar in her corner.While the teenager will continue with schooling in Spain, Imran cautioned against too much tinkering with technique. ""In Europe, most of the training is more suited to the clay-court game,"" he said, ""There can be exceptions, (but) we seem to be more suited to hard courts because we have more skill in our hands, and in our joints than in the feet.""","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi, 15, is ranked No. 646 in the WTA rankings.

CHENNAI: Italy’s Jannik Sinner appears to be by far the most in-form men’s tennis player on the world circuit. Despite facing doping allegations, the world No. 1 did not let that affect him as he asserted his authority by winning the US Open and Australian Open.Indian legend Vijay Amritraj credited coach Darren Cahill for Sinner’s success. “The one major factor in Sinner’s game has been Cahill. I always knew that Darren had a very strong mental approach, and his ability to impart that to you and help you reach a point where you believe in yourself, where there is no second place for me – only first – has been crucial. And when I see Sinner play, I see a lot of that in him,” Vijay, who introduced Cahill to television, said on the sidelines of the Chennai Open Challenger. Novak Djokovic ’s decision to join forces with coach Andy Murray took Vijay by surprise. Djokovic and his former rival Murray began their partnership at the Australian Open, and the 37-year-old had a decent start to the season, reaching the semifinals.“I am surprised by Andy’s decision because he has just finished his tennis career, and to jump into something like this... you know, he has a family and would probably want to stay home. But he loves the game so much. I think they are a good match, and Andy can rejuvenate Djokovic to perform better.“Also, Djokovic’s match against (Carlos) Alcaraz was unbelievable – one of the best matches we have seen in a long time. Alcaraz is marginally more inconsistent mentally. He has more to offer in terms of his game,” Vijay added.The former Davis Cup finalist was vocal about the US Open’s move to add an extra day to the competition. He also stressed that the ATP reducing the number of 250-level Tour events is not a good sign. “By adding a day, they have killed the ATP 250 tournament the week before. The Slams are very important but let us not forget that you need tournaments in every part of the world. To become a Djokovic, (Roger) Federer, or (Rafael) Nadal, you still need other players to beat, right? These five or six guys alone cannot go and play the Grand Slams. You need another 100 players in the draw. So, I do not understand why they do not allow others to host tournaments.”'Trying to bring a big tournament to India'India lost its right to host an ATP 250 event a few years ago. In 2022, the country hosted a WTA 250 Tour event, but it has not been a permanent fixture on the calendar. Vijay has been pushing to host a top-level event in India but to no avail. “If you want to be a global sport, you need to have an event in India. When I was playing in the 70s and 80s, we had tournaments across all capitals in Asia. And you are saying none of this is possible? I am being very vocal with these guys about doing this,” said Vijay, who is the president of the Tamil Nadu Tennis Association (TNTA).",Vijay Amritraj credits coach Darren Cahill for Italy's Jannik Sinner's success.

Chennai Open: Kyrian Jacquet battles past Ymer to title,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/chennai-open-kyrian-jacquet-battles-past-ymer-to-title/articleshow/118121948.cms,"Kyrian Jacquet

Chennai: Soon after winning the Chennai Open Challenger men’s singles title on Sunday, Kyrian Jacquet humbly stated that he had not played his best tennis over the week. However, during the Frenchman’s journey to the crown, he defeated two seeded players and dropped just a single set.The 23-year-old Jacquet’s level was enough to comfortably beat Elias Ymer of Sweden 7-6(1), 6-4 in the final, a result that handed him the coveted title and 100 ranking points.At the SDAT Stadium , Jacquet made an early breakthrough, taking a 4-2 lead in the opening set. However, Ymer refused to back down, breaking Jacquet’s serve in the eighth game and pushing the set into a tie-breaker. But the tie-breaker was a one-sided affair, with the Swede making six unforced errors and leaving Jacquet with little to do.In the second set, Ymer’s unforced errors continued to give Jacquet an advantage and soon, the former was trailing 1-4. Though Ymer fought back, winning three games in a row, he faltered in the end. Inconsistency crept in, and errors began to pile up. Jacquet, maintaining his composure, comfortably cruised to victory with a double fault from Ymer sealing the win.Jacquet operated with the strategy of using his slices effectively, taking pace off the ball. By doing so, he disrupted Ymer’s rhythm, forcing him to generate more pace on his shots. “I played a lot of slices during all the matches because I like to play slices to change the rhythm. I try to destabilise the opponent. So yeah, I did well today (Sunday),” Jacquet said.Jacquet had previously mentioned that he believes his tennis is better than what his current ranking reflects. Last year, a string of injuries forced him to be sidelined for eight months, which led to a drop in his ranking. His performance in Chennai showed that he is on the comeback trail, proving his potential. “I play better than my rank, that is for sure. It was very tough last year, and I did all the work that I could to be ready to come here. I am really happy about the week because I was feeling better and better as the days went by. If I continue to play like this, I will go up faster (in the rankings).”Jacquet will jump above 60 places and get close to the top-200 mark in the ATP singles chart.","Kyrian Jacquet beat Elias Ymer of Sweden 7-6(1), 6-4 in the final.

Jil Teichmann takes the spoils in Mumbai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jil-teichmann-takes-the-spoils-in-mumbai/articleshow/118104219.cms,"Thombare-Hartono lose

MUMBAI: Going into Sunday's L&T Mumbai Open final, fifth seed Jil Teichmann was not aware if a win would send her back into the top 100 of the WTA Rankings .After a convincing 6-3, 6-4 win over Thailand's Mananchaya Sawangkaew at the Cricket Club of India , she knew.""My coach didn't tell me either,"" Teichmann said with a wide grin after picking up her second WTA 125k title in the last five months. ""For me it was definitely a goal to win this trophy. I am smart, so I kind of did the maths but I didn't know if it's going to be top 100 or not. The next little goal I had was to crack the top 100 again and to keep going.""Ranked 117 at the start of the week, Sunday's triumph launched the 27-year-old Swiss to 100th spot in the live rankings.The manner in which she played, not just on Sunday, but for most of this week, was a reminder, though, of why she was just outside the top 20 less than three years ago.Sawangkaew, the World No. 121, cracked under pressure from Teichmann's variety and precision in her groundstrokes, going down a double break in the first set. Even though she was able to get one back, the lead was too much as the fifth seed took the opening set.The Thai's forehand often let her down in the 1 hour, 37 minute encounter, and three errors in succession gave Teichmann an early break in set two. Though the eighth seed was able to break back immediately, the inconsistency in her game proved detrimental to her chances, as the Swiss grabbed the advantage once again.Sawangkaew did manage to draw level in the sixth game, but Teichmann banked on her lethal forehand, producing two timely winners to earn the decisive break in the seventh game.Her booming serve down the T has been another formidable weapon this week, and she landed one perfectly to bring up three match points. Sawangkaew saved the first but a deft backhand volley from Teichmann was a fitting way for the Swiss to complete the win, and take home $15,500.In the doubles final, Prarthana Thombare and Arianne Hartono endured heartbreak for the second year in a row, as the Indian-Dutch pairing went down 7-6(4), 2-6, 10-7 to the all-Russian combination of Amina Anshba and Elena Pridankina.","Jil Teichmann beats Mananchaya Sawangkaew 6-3, 6-4 in the L&T Mumbai Open final. The victory takes the Swiss to 100th in the WTA rankings.

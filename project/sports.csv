NEW DELHI: Injured Australia captain Pat Cummins has been ruled out of the first Ashes Test against England in Perth next month, Cricket Australia confirmed on Monday. The governing body stated that ""Cummins will not be fit in time"" as he continues to recover from a lower back injury. Veteran batter Steve Smith will lead the side in his absence.Australia remain hopeful that their pace spearhead could return later in the five-Test series. ""Cummins has resumed running and expects to return to bowling shortly,"" Cricket Australia said.The 32-year-old has not played since sustaining the injury during a Test against the West Indies in July. Scott Boland is the likely replacement, joining fellow quicks Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood.Cummins' race to prove his fitness has become a major storyline leading up to the first Test, starting in Perth on November 21.""I'm still doing a bit of gym and keeping things kicking over, but with this kind of injury, it's rest and then we'll build back and kind of work back from the Ashes,"" he said in September.""Still really hopeful to be able to be part of the Ashes. But it is a little bit of a wait and see.""Cummins has suffered serious back issues several times over the years, including a flare-up in 2018 that kept him out of action for a full off-season.Australia coach Andrew McDonald has said he may still pick Cummins at some point even if he was a ""little bit underdone"" with his rehabilitation.England are bringing a pace-heavy attack for the series, spearheaded by Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Josh Tongue, Brydon Carse and Mark Wood.Former fast bowler Stuart Broad stoked the bitter rivalry between the two sides earlier this month when he claimed Australia were fielding their weakest line-up in 15 years.""It's probably the worst Australian team since 2010 when England last won (in Australia), and it's the best English team since 2010,"" Broad, now working as a pundit, told the BBC.""It's actually not an opinion, it's fact.""But the reality remains that England have an appalling record playing in Australia.Australia retained the Ashes in England in 2023 after the series ended in a 2-2 draw.They beat England 4-0 at home in 2021-22 when Cummins was the leading bowler with 21 wickets at an average of 18.The 2010-11 series, taken by the tourists 3-1, is the only Ashes in Australia since 2002-03 in which England have even won a Test.",Cricket Australia captain Pat Cummins ruled out of first Ashes Test against England.

Poll Who do you think is the most responsible for the fight at the Santiago Bernabéu? Real Madrid players Barcelona players The referee Both teams equally

A big fight broke out between the players of Real Madrid and Barcelona after the final whistle at the Santiago Bernabéu.Real Madrid won the match 2-1, and in the last minute of the game, Barcelona's Pedri received a red card.Then there was real commotion on the bench. Éder Militão and backup keeper Andriy Lunin were booked, but seconds later, things kicked off again when referee César Soto Grado blew his full-time whistle.Several players from both teams clashed, and police and security personnel were forced to intervene.Speaking this week on the Kings League YouTube channel — the seven-a-side football tournament established by Barcelona icon Gerard Piqué — the 18-year-old was asked if Porcinos, a team in the competition, was similar to Real.""Yes, they rob (a reference to refereeing decisions); they complain; they do things..."" Yamal replied.It began when Dani Carvajal confronted Lamine Yamal after the wonderkid's recent comments.Real keeper Thibaut Courtois then joined in and pushed Yamal away as things got heated. Vinícius Júnior tried to challenge Yamal as he was led off by security but was restrained.After the game, Real goal scorer Jude Bellingham took a jibe at Yamal on social media.""Talk is cheap,"" he wrote on Instagram.Lamine Yamal's father was quick to react, posting several images on Instagram. The first contained a message preparing for the second-leg match: ""Thank goodness he's 18. See you in Barcelona.""The second was a photo with his son with the following message: “Till death do us part, my ganga.”Barcelona's Frenkie de Jong said that the experienced Carvajal, who plays with Yamal in the national team, did not have to confront him in that way.""If you are a teammate of Lamine and don't think he should do that, then you can talk to him privately,"" De Jong told Marca.","Fight breaks out between Real Madrid and Barcelona players after the final whistle at the Santiago Bernabéu.

SCOREBOARD

SHIVAMOGGA: From the mundane leap in the air, to a talk-to-my bat gesture, Karun Nair has celebrated landmarks on the field differently. On Sunday, when he scored his 25th First-Class century, the celebrations were muted.At the KSCA Navule Stadium here, Karun, 33, acknowledged the applause from the sizeable crowd and his teammates perfunctorily, with a bat and helmet raised, and then went about his job.By the time Karnataka’s wobbly first innings folded, Karun was the only one still standing, having scored an unbeaten 174 (267b, 14x4; 3x6) over a staggering 435 minutes. That innings helped prop up Karnataka on Day 2 of the Ranji Trophy match against Goa.On the strength of Karun’s marathon innings and a well-crafted 57 from Shreyas Gopal, Karnataka reached 371 before folding in 110.1 overs. In reply, Goa were 28/1 in 13 overs before the skies opened at 2.44pm. Play was eventually called off at 4.40pm with only 54.1 overs being bowled on the day.Asked about his understated celebration, Karun said, “It was a satisfying innings, but it’s still early in the season, so I’ll save celebrations for later.I have a lot to show, we’ll see.”Over the past couple of days, Karun has already shown plenty. He has allied class and character with skill and temperament, hallmarks which he showcased all through last season.Karnataka were in a tailspin at 26/2 on the opening day when Karun walked into bat. He returned on Sunday and resumed from his overnight 86. Gopal (57; 109; 6x4; 1x6), Karun’s overnight partner, completed his half-century before poking a Vijesh Prabhudesai delivery to skipper Snehal Kauthankar at first slip. Their 117-run partnership had the potential of being much bigger.Yashovardhan Parantap looked in good nick, finding the gaps twice, but it didn't take him long to gift his wicket away. He needlessly tried to clear the long-on boundary off Koushik, but only found Prabhudesai at mid-off.Vyshak Vijaykumar (31) built a 60-run stand with Karun before he was trapped in the front by Darshan Misal.Running out of partners, Karun upped the tempo and brought up his 150 with a maximum off Arjun Tendulkar. That over, the 105th of Karnataka’s innings, Karun punished a short-pitched delivery from Arjun, and then slammed a boundary.Abhilash Shetty followed Vyshak and the curtains on Karnataka's innings fell when Vidwath Kaverappa was run out by Abhinav Tejrana, while trying to steal a non-existent run. Karnataka added 149 runs to their overnight score of 222. Goa lost opener Manthan Khutkar early, with the wicketkeeper pouching an edge off Abhilash.Karnataka (I innings o/n 222/5): Karun Nair (not out) 174, Shreyas Gopal (c Kauthankar b V Prabhudesai 57, Yashovardhan Parantap c V Prabhudesai b Koushik 14, Vyshak Vijaykumar lbw Misal 31, Abhilash Shetty c Tejrana b Misal 2, Vidwath Kaverappa (run out) 0.

Pratika Rawal Father Interview: On daughter's hundred, the World Cup dream and more

Radha Yadav

takes 3-30 to restrict Bangladesh to 119/9

NAVI MUMBAI: With just three days to go before their 2025 Women's ODI World Cup semifinal clash against mighty Australia at the DY Patil Stadium, India have suffered a big injury scare to one of their key players in the last league match of the tournament, against Bangladesh at the same venue on Sunday, which was abandoned due to unrelenting unseasonal rain.Opener Pratik Rawal, who has been the second-highest run-getter for India after her senior opening partner Smriti Mandhana , having scored 308 runs in six matches@51.33, including a half-century against Australia and a 134-ball 122 against New Zealand in the last match, twisted her ankle in the 21st over of Bangladesh's innings while she fell while charging towards the ball at long-on. While she wasn't stretchered away, the 25-year-old was helped off the field by her teammates, and was somehow able to walk, which means that it's perhaps not a fracture.The BCCI soon put out an update about her injury, which read: “Team India all-rounder Pratika Rawal sustained an injury to her knee and ankle while fielding in the first innings against Bangladesh. The BCCI Medical Team is closely monitoring her progress.”With Pratika injured, it was allrounder Amanjot Kaur (15 not out) who opened India's innings with Mandhana (34 not out, 27b, 6x4s), as India, asked to chase 126 in 27 overs as per the D/L method in a rain-curtailed match, reached 57 for no loss in in the ninth over before rain interrupted the match for the fifth and last time.India will bank heavily on Mandhana and Pratika's hugely consistent opening partnership if they are hoping to upset Australia's applecart in the semis clash. This is the second injury to a gun player in the Indian camp - explosive ‘keeper-bat Richa Ghosh, who hurt her finger in the 55-run win over New Zealand at this venue, and was rested for the match, with Uma Chetry making her WODI debut.The 23-year-old Chetry is now the first woman cricketer from Assam and the Northeast region to play for India in the Women's World Cup India will hope that both Pritika and Richa recover in time for the semis clash.Meanwhile, playing her first game in the tournament, left-arm spinner Radha Yadav utilised the opportunity with both hands, taking three for 30 in six overs to help India restrict Bangladesh to 119 for nine in 27 overs after asking them to bat first. Proving her worth as perhaps the best fielder in the side, Radha also pulled off a superb direct hit at the non-striker's end to run out captain Nigar Sultana (nine off 24 balls).Resuming their innings at 39 for two in 12.2 overs after a 135-minute long rain break, Bangladesh collapsed swiftly, losing seven wickets while adding merely 80 runs in 88 balls, as left-arm spinner Shree Charini too made merry, taking two for 23 in six overs. Apart from Radha, the other display of electric fielding came from substitute fielder, pacer Arundhati Reddy, who pulled off blinder when she sprinted from deep mid-wicket and slid forward to catch Bangladesh's top-scorer Sharmin Akhter (36, 43b, 4x4), before throwing the ball up in exultation.Despite rain threatening to wash out the entire match at one point, it was heartening to see around 15,000 spectators still staying back to cheer for the Women-In-Blue at a regular venue for women's international cricket. With India having already qualified for the semifinals, the match was inconsequential, but many enthusiastic fans still turned up in the stadium, music blaring in the background, hoping for the action to resume.Going ahead, there's a rain threat to the second semifinal and final of the World Cup too, which will both be played in Navi Mumbai as well, but the good news is that as per the ICC rules, there's a reserve day for both the semifinals and the final.On a gloomy Sunday afternoon, Indian captain Harmanpreet Kaur decided to bowl first at the toss, which was delayed by 35 minutes. It was the first toss won by Harmanpreet for India Women in ODIs after losing eight on the trot - their joint-longest streak in the format, alongside as many for Mithali Raj between Feb 2006 and Jul 2006.Earlier, Bangladesh struggled with the conditions before the heavens opened up again. Off the last ball of the first over, Sumaiya Akter sliced a wide ball outside off-stump to Charani at short third. Rubya Haider, who scratched around for 13 off 32 balls, lofted Deepti Sharma, who opened the bowling, to Harleen Deol at mid-off.India made as many as three changes to their line-up for the inconsequential match. The tournament hosts also decided to give a break to pacer Kranti Goud and off-spinning allrounder Sneh Rana, while bringing back Amanjot.","Opener Pratika Rawal twisted her ankle in the 21st over of Bangladesh's innings while she fell while charging towards the ball at long-on.

Pratika Rawal Father Interview: On daughter's hundred, the World Cup dream and more

Watch:

NEW DELHI: India were dealt a major injury scare on Sunday as in-form opener Pratika Rawal hobbled off the field after twisting her ankle during their ICC Women’s World Cup group match against Bangladesh at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai.Fielding at deep midwicket, Rawal appeared to twist her right ankle while attempting to stop a boundary on the final ball of the 21st over. The ball trickled away to the fence as she fell awkwardly on the wet outfield, which had remained uncovered throughout the rain-affected contest.The 25-year-old looked visibly in pain as India’s medical staff rushed onto the field. A stretcher was quickly brought in, but Rawal chose to hobble off with the help of team personnel, avoiding it.“Team India all-rounder Pratika Rawal sustained an injury to her knee and ankle while fielding in the first innings against Bangladesh. The BCCI Medical Team is closely monitoring her progress,” the Indian team management confirmed in a statement.Rawal has been one of India’s standout performers in the tournament, forming a formidable opening partnership with vice-captain Smriti Mandhana . Just days earlier, she had struck a match-winning 122 against New Zealand to power India into the semifinals.Her availability will now be a key concern for the team ahead of Thursday’s all-important semi-final clash against Australia.Despite the scare, India dominated Bangladesh, restricting them to 119/9 in a 27-over rain-truncated contest. Radha Yadav (3/30) and Shree Charani (2/23) led the bowling effort, while Sharmin Akhter (36) and Sobhana Mostary (26) were the only batters to offer resistance for the visitors.The incident cast a shadow over an otherwise controlled display by India. As the team gears up for their semifinal showdown with their fiercest rivals, all eyes will now be on Rawal’s recovery. The 25-year-old’s fitness could play a decisive role in India’s pursuit of their maiden Women’s World Cup title, and the team will hope for a swift return to full strength.","Pratika Rawal hobbled off the field after twisting her ankle during India's match against Bangladesh.

India vs Australia: Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma rewrite history at SCG

NEW DELHI: Veteran batter Ajinkya Rahane made a compelling statement on Sunday after a commanding 159 for Mumbai against Chhattisgarh in the Ranji Trophy , voicing his disappointment over being overlooked for India's 2024-25 tour to Australia. At 37, Rahane stressed that age should never be a criterion for national selection and highlighted how his experience could have benefited the team during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, which India lost 1-3.“Age is just a number. It's about the intent. It's about the passion for red-ball cricket and the hard work you put in the middle,” Rahane said. Citing the example of Australian great Michael Hussey, who made a late Test debut yet delivered heavily, Rahane added, “Experience matters in red-ball cricket and I thought personally the Indian team needed me in Australia — that's my personal feeling.”Rahane reflected on his comeback in the 2023 WTC final against Australia and his subsequent performances, underlining that he had consistently played domestic cricket to stay match-ready. “You always see selectors talk about playing domestic cricket. I've been playing domestic cricket for the last 4-5 seasons. Sometimes, it's not about the runs or performance, it's about the intent, it's about the experience,” he explained.The Mumbai veteran voiced his hurt over the lack of communication from selectors. “After playing so much cricket for India, an experienced player like me should get more chances when you make a comeback. But there was no communication. I can focus on only the controllable things, which I am doing right now,” Rahane said.Using the recent ODI heroics of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli as proof of experience's value, he argued, “It proves that age is just a number. At the highest level, when you have guys like Rohit and Virat who have won so many matches for India, you need that experience in the team. You cannot go with all newcomers.”Rahane also addressed off-field chatter, hitting back at critics and offering guidance to young players like Sarfaraz Khan . “Don't get distracted, don't get frustrated… keep your head down and focus on the controllable things. Mumbai cricket is behind him, and we know how good he is,” he said.By blending a dominant on-field performance with candid reflections, Rahane delivered a strong message to the selectors: experience, intent, and passion deserve recognition, regardless of age.","Mumbai batsman Ajinkya Rahane voiced his disappointment over being overlooked for India's 2024-25 tour to Australia.

Shubman Gill Press Conference: Captain hails Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli after India’s big win

NEW DELHI: After finishing as India’s highest run-scorer in the recently concluded ODI series against Australia, Rohit Sharma revealed on Sunday how a rare long break from international cricket helped him prepare mentally and physically for the challenging tour Down Under.Rohit, who has rarely enjoyed a 4-5 month gap in his international career, said the break allowed him to train at his own pace and focus on what he needed to do for the rest of his career.“Since the time I started playing, I never had four to five months to prepare for a series, so I wanted to utilise that. I wanted to do things in my own way, on my own terms, and that actually worked out pretty well for me. Understanding what I need to do for the rest of my career, it was important to utilise that time because, like I said, I never had such time in my hand. I prepared pretty well back home. Obviously, the conditions back home and here are not ideal. It’s a massive difference between the two countries, but I’ve come here so many times. So it was just about getting into that rhythm and understanding what I need to do here,” Rohit said in a BCCI video.The veteran opener’s patience and preparation paid off in the third ODI at Sydney Cricket Ground, where he scored an unbeaten 121 off 125 balls, anchoring India’s chase of 237. Rohit shared 69 runs with Shubman Gill (24) for the first wicket before joining forces with Virat Kohli (74 not out off 81 balls) to put on an unbroken 168-run partnership, rescuing India from a potential whitewash.Rohit also highlighted the impact of young players like Harshit Rana, who grabbed 4/39, saying, “Looking at how he bowled, it was a fantastic effort from him.” His innings, combined with Kohli’s resilience, underscored the blend of experience and mentorship that India still possesses.Reflecting on the series, Rohit expressed gratitude to the fans and the Australian crowd: “Very, very grateful firstly to have people standing beside you. Whenever we’ve played, people have come out and supported, not just the two of us but the entire team… The crowd never disappoints. Unfortunately, we couldn’t cross the line with the series, but we enjoyed coming and playing here and are really, really grateful to the crowd for their support throughout Australia. ”Rohit’s performance demonstrated the benefits of focused preparation, experience, and patience, reinforcing why he remains a pivotal figure for India’s ODI side even after stepping away from Tests and T20Is.","Rohit Sharma has rarely enjoyed a 4-5 month gap in his international career.

Shubman Gill Press Conference: Captain hails Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli after India’s big win

NEW DELHI: Senior opener Rohit Sharma played a commanding role in India’s nine-wicket victory over Australia in the third ODI, posting an unbeaten 121 to anchor the chase of 237 runs at a packed Sydney Cricket Ground. Rohit shared an unbroken 168-run stand with Virat Kohli , who contributed a fluent 74 not out, guiding India home with authority.Despite the win, India lost the three-match series 1-2, but Rohit emphasised the positives, particularly highlighting the performances of young players like Harshit Rana. In a video shared by the BCCI , Rohit said, “Unfortunately, we couldn't win the series, but I think it's still a very relatively young team. A lot of the guys haven't been here, playing white-ball cricket. So, we can take a lot of positives also from here, especially Harshit Rana, who's been playing white-ball cricket for the first time in Australia. The way he bowled in both the games, Perth obviously was a shortened game, but looking at how he bowled in Adelaide and also here, it was a fantastic effort from him. ”Rohit also reflected on the challenges of playing against a tough Australian side: “They are a tough opposition.We've seen that over the years, how they play their cricket, they really enjoy being out there in the middle. They never let anything come to you easy. You always have to work really, really hard. Having been here, playing with these guys so many times, it's very important to stand up and get the best out of whatever experience you have against them. They are a quality team, no doubt about that.”Speaking about his own innings, Rohit shared the strategy behind his approach: “I enjoy playing in Australia in general. Today was the perfect day again to get a big one and get the team through. The bowlers did a fantastic job of restricting them first up. Up front with the two new balls, it was a bit challenging. I wanted to bat as deep as possible and see how we can take the game till the end.

Arsenal stretched their Premier League lead to four points on Sunday thanks to Eberechi Eze’s decisive strike against his former club Crystal Palace, while Manchester City’s title hopes took a blow with a 1-0 loss at Aston Villa.Eze, who joined Arsenal in a £60 million ($80 million) move in August, netted his first Premier League goal for the Gunners with a stunning volley from Declan Rice’s free-kick six minutes before half-time. Palace failed to clear the delivery, allowing the England international to fire in the match-winner. The victory keeps Arsenal’s defence solid, marking their 10th clean sheet in 13 games across all competitions this season.Manager Mikel Arteta , however, will be concerned as Rice and William Saliba were both forced off in the second half due to injuries. Despite not hitting top gear going forward, Arsenal’s mix of defensive resilience and set-piece efficiency has proved enough to maintain their grip at the top. The Gunners now lead fourth-placed City by six points and have a seven-point cushion over sixth-placed Liverpool.Manchester City’s loss at Villa Park ended Erling Haaland’s 12-game Premier League scoring streak.Matty Cash’s spectacular strike from outside the box in the 19th minute secured a third consecutive season win for Aston Villa at home and pushed Unai Emery’s side into seventh place. Haaland had a late goal ruled out for offside, and with no other City player scoring in the league for over a month, Guardiola’s side was left frustrated.Elsewhere, Bournemouth climbed to second after beating Nottingham Forest 2-0. Marcus Tavernier opened the scoring directly from a corner, with Eli Junior Kroupi adding a second to continue his prolific run. Forest remain in the bottom three despite Sean Dyche’s managerial start in Europe.At the foot of the table, Wolves remain in the relegation zone after Burnley claimed a dramatic 3-2 win at Molineux.

MANCHESTER: The crisis is over for Manchester United . For now at least.For Liverpool, however, it is a very different story after a fourth straight loss in the Premier League on Saturday.

""I am sure we will get out of it, but we won't get out of it by just talking about it.""Brentford led 2-0 after goals from Dango Ouattara and Kevin Schade.

Not since 1984 has Liverpool successfully retained the title.In all, it was a fifth loss from the last six games in all competitions.Slot said it was the worst performance of all the losses in the league.""We didn't do the basics right, especially the first half, but during parts of the second half as well,"" he told TNT Sports.Amorim reaches winning benchmark at United A third straight win for United extended Amorim's best league run since he was appointed as coach last November, and provided a sense of momentum not felt for a long time at Old Trafford.""I think we are improving in the bad moments,"" he said.

Argentina's national football team and star player Lionel Messi will not be visiting Kerala in November for a planned friendly match, as confirmed by sponsors following the Argentina Football Association's announcement that the team would only play in Angola next month. This development has ended weeks of anticipation after both the Kerala government and private sponsors had announced a high-profile friendly match scheduled for November 17 in Kochi.Argentine media reports indicate that AFA officials cited Kerala's ""lack of readiness"" and delays in completing logistical arrangements within the agreed timeline as reasons for the cancellation.The organisers have suggested rescheduling the visit to March 2026, though this timing coincides with Kerala's Assembly polls scheduled for April or May of that year.The cancellation has sparked a political controversy, with Congress leadership criticising the state government for announcing the event without formal confirmation from the AFA.The situation highlights challenges in coordinating international sports events, particularly regarding communication between various stakeholders. The cancellation has disappointed Indian football fans, particularly in Kerala, where Argentina and Messi have a substantial following.Messi's last appearance in India was in 2011, when he led Argentina against Venezuela at Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium in his debut match as national captain.","Argentina's national football team and star player Lionel Messi will not be visiting Kerala in November for a planned friendly match, as confirmed by sponsors.

Bill Belichick struggles in College Football transition



Bill Belichick contract and future options



The Bill Belichick era at North Carolina has started with turbulence, as the Tar Heels struggle to find consistency with a 2-5 record. Questions surrounding the legendary coach’s future continue to loom over Chapel Hill, leaving fans and analysts debating whether this bold college experiment will pay off. Despite recent losses, the team has shown sparks of competitiveness, hinting at potential for improvement as the season unfolds.North Carolina’s overtime defeat to Virginia, a narrow 17-16 loss, underscored the challenges Belichick faces in his first college season. ""Just trying to win the game,"" Belichick said succinctly when asked to explain his postgame decisions, emphasizing a pragmatic approach amid growing pressure. The Tar Heels remain winless against Power Four opponents, yet On3’s Pete Nakos reported that the university will retain Belichick through the end of the season, with any decisions about his long-term role deferred to the offseason.This start marks one of the rare rough stretches in Belichick’s storied coaching career, including a four-game losing streak not seen since his early Cleveland Browns years in the 1990s and more recently during the 2023 New England Patriots season.The Tar Heels’ current trajectory highlights the steep learning curve even the most successful NFL coach faces when transitioning to college football.Financial considerations also play a key role in Belichick’s potential future at North Carolina. The five-year, $50 million contract guarantees the first three seasons, meaning a buyout would exceed $20 million if the university decides to part ways. Conversely, if Belichick chooses to leave Chapel Hill, he would owe the program $1 million—a significant drop from the initial $10 million figure earlier in the year.Looking ahead, North Carolina has opportunities to stabilize, with upcoming games against Syracuse, Stanford, Wake Forest, Duke, and NC State. While wins are not guaranteed, these matchups offer Belichick a chance to salvage momentum, refine his college coaching strategy, and demonstrate that his risk-taking approach—like the bold two-point decision against Virginia—can translate to victories. The Tar Heels now face the dual challenge of winning games and building confidence under one of football’s most legendary minds.Also Read: Madison Beer stuns in matching sailor costume with boyfriend Justin Herbert at LA Halloween bash","Bill Belichick's future at North Carolina hangs in the balance.

Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers stole the spotlight during Sunday Night Football against his former team, the Green Bay Packers. At 41, Rodgers looks rejuvenated in his 21st NFL season, and a significant change in his personal life is fueling this renewed energy. Off the field, the two-time MVP has embraced privacy, marrying a woman known only as Brittani—a move that has kept fans and media guessing.Rodgers’ personal life has always drawn attention, from public romances with celebrities like Olivia Munn, Danica Patrick, and Shailene Woodley to his highly publicized career moves. This offseason, however, he quietly tied the knot with Brittani, whose identity remains largely undisclosed. The quarterback respects her desire for privacy, keeping her away from social media and public events.“I’m with somebody who’s private, who doesn’t want to be in the public eye, didn’t sign up to be a celebrity, doesn’t want to be a part of it,” Rodgers told ESPN’s Pat McAfee in June. “I’m with somebody who wants to be private. If and when she wants to be out and there’s a picture, she’ll choose that.”Though the couple has not been photographed together, Rodgers’ happiness is apparent.He confirmed to NFL Network’s Kyle Brandt, “To have that person that unconditionally loves you, behind the scenes, there’s no better feeling in the world.” The quarterback’s focus on his personal life influenced his return to the Steelers this season, with his sister-in-law Mia reportedly encouraging the move.Rodgers’ transition from Green Bay to Pittsburgh has been smooth, despite the tension surrounding his exit. Reflecting on his career, he emphasizes the relationships formed along the way rather than personal headlines. “This game is about the relationships,” Rodgers said. “Three years in college, 21 years in the league, and in those 24 years, I've got a ton of lifelong friends I've made. The majority of what's special in my life is because of the game. ”Even after decades in the NFL, Rodgers remains humble about the sport’s demands and rewards. “The humbling thing is that when you're done, whether done with organization and moved on, or just done, the game keeps going. This game's given me a lot, and I love it. It's an imperfect profession and a tough business. But it's a wonderful job that I've gotten to do for so long.”Despite fan curiosity, Rodgers has drawn a firm line between his public and private lives. “I know that I’ve chosen to be in the public eye for one more season, but my private life is staying private,” he told McAfee. For Rodgers, love, privacy, and football coexist, showing fans that even the NFL’s brightest stars can keep some chapters of their lives entirely their own.Also Read: Who is Tucker Kraft’s wife?

Postgame handshakes turn ugly between Bills and Panthers



Bills end losing streak while Panthers struggle



The Buffalo Bills delivered a statement win on Sunday, rolling past the Carolina Panthers 40-9 in a game that quickly got out of hand. With Josh Allen and James Cook leading the charge, the Bills snapped a two-game losing streak, moving to 5-2 on the season. The Panthers, starting backup QB Andy Dalton, struggled throughout, falling to 4-4. But while the score told one story, emotions told another, sparking an intense postgame scene.Video captured by ESPN’s Kimberly A. Martin showed Bills offensive lineman Dion Dawkins and Panthers defensive tackle A'Shawn Robinson in a heated exchange. Dawkins appeared to throw something at Robinson while being held back, and Robinson attempted to retaliate. “Robinson wasn’t happy after the blowout,” Dawkins told Martin, explaining the tension. The confrontation highlighted the intense emotions following a lopsided game. While the scene was violent, it seemed to de-escalate before it got out of control.It’s rare to see such incidents outside of traditional rivalries, but the combination of a blowout loss and the energy of a team bouncing back from defeat may have fueled the flare-up.Dawkins, known for his friendly and extroverted personality, may have unintentionally provoked Robinson during the postgame handshakes. NFL officials will likely review the incident to determine if any disciplinary action is warranted.The victory improves the Bills to 5-2 on the season, snapping a two-game skid and reinforcing their position as a playoff contender. For the Panthers, the loss drops them to 4-4, a disappointing result after a surprisingly strong start to the season. The game was a stark reminder of how quickly momentum can shift in the NFL and how emotions can run high on and off the field.Sunday’s clash delivered a decisive on-field performance and an unforgettable postgame moment, leaving fans talking about both the win and the unexpected tensions that followed.Also Read: Why is Brian Kelly’s time at LSU ending so abruptly and what will his firing cost the Tigers?",Buffalo Bills beat Carolina Panthers 40-9 on Sunday.

Packers break out the icy “winter warning” look again before debuting a 1923-inspired classic

Steelers harken back to 1933 with a sharp twist on Steel City heritage



When the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers take the field on Sunday Night Football, football fashion suddenly becomes part of the headline act.

The full frostbite aesthetic includes a matching white helmet, white pants, and snowy socks, making the team look ready to blend into Lambeau on a December night.This isn’t just about style points. The Packers are 3-0 in these alternates over the past two seasons, giving the look a bit of good-luck charm.

The Packers will unveil their “1923 classic” uniforms against Carolina, a tribute to the year the franchise first became publicly owned. Navy and gold threads, tan pants, and a hand-painted “leather helmet” design pay homage to the rugged roots of the early NFL.It’s football anthropology stitched into fabric.As for Pittsburgh Steelers, fans can breathe easy: the infamous bumblebee uniforms remain safely in retirement. Instead, the Steelers are returning to 1933, the year the franchise played its first season. The throwback ensemble includes a gold helmet with a bold black stripe, black-and-white block numbering, and beige pants that mimic the original khaki look.One subtle but meaningful touch stands out: the Pittsburgh City Crest sits on the upper left chest, a nod to the team’s identity and its connection to the community that forged football legends from steel and sweat.With Rodgers vs. Love adding quarterback intrigue and both fanbases flexing tradition-rich jerseys, this SNF clash feels like a history lesson wrapped in a big game atmosphere.

Now, the five-time Lakers point guard will be sitting at least for the next week along with LeBron James Due to his left leg contusion and sprained left finger, Los Angeles Lakers star Luka Doncic will miss playing the Sacramento Kings on Sunday. Doncic has started his first full season with the Lakers in great condition despite injury worries.As per Dan Woike:“News from the Lakers Lakers guard Luka Dončić has been diagnosed with a left finger sprain and lower left leg contusion. Dončić will be reevaluated in approximately one week…”The 6-foot-6 guard has been diagnosed with a left finger sprain and, surprisingly, a lower left leg contusion, according to Jovan Buha of ""Buha's Block."" In a week, he will be reviewed, which might extend his stay.However, Woike has been reportedly informed by a source that there are no long-term concerns over the injury. According to ESPN, the Lakers are hopeful that Doncic won't require more time to heal than it was first anticipated.He was off to a quick start after LeBron James was sidelined. Now, Austin Reaves will likely be the Lakers' primary player with Doncic and James out of action.Having previously lost James, the Lakers are hugely impacted by the loss of Doncic.Luka has been out for at least a week due to a lower left thigh contusion and a sprained left finger following his 49-point performance against the Wolves. He had his finger wrapped quite early in the game after hurting it against Minnesota . He scored baskets at will throughout the game, demonstrating that it didn't slow him down. However, it will contribute to his absence for the upcoming week.As for the contusion in the lower left leg, it's unclear when it happened. Doncic began his inaugural full season with the Lakers in tremendous shape despite the injury concerns. The 26-year-old has established a new franchise record for the most points a Laker has through the first two games of a season.He came very close to missing triple-doubles both times, scoring 43 points against Golden State Warriors to start the season and then 49 points against Minnesota Timberwolves.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers’ secret Luka Doncic group chat leaks fiery message as franchise goes all-in on new superstar","Luka Doncic has been diagnosed with a left finger sprain and a lower left leg contusion.

Milwaukee Bucks and Cleveland Cavaliers

Milwaukee Bucks’ Injury Update: Giannis Expected to Play Despite Toe Sprain

Cleveland Cavaliers’ Injury Situation: Garland and Strus Remain Out

Game Preview: Milwaukee’s Firepower vs. Cleveland’s Home Advantage

Theare set for an early-season showdown tonight, October 26, 2025, at Rocket Arena in Cleveland. Both Eastern Conference contenders come in with solid momentum but face significant injury concerns that could shape the outcome of this highly anticipated clash. Milwaukee Bucks ’ superstar forward Giannis Antetokounmpo is officially listed as probable with a left great toe sprain, an issue he has been managing throughout the week. Despite playing through discomfort, the two-time MVP hasn’t missed a beat. In the Bucks’ previous victory over Toronto, Giannis exploded for 31 points, 20 rebounds, and seven assists, anchoring Milwaukee’s offense and helping them improve to 2-0. He is expected to suit up again tonight, continuing to lead the charge on both ends of the floor.However, the Bucks’ supporting cast remains banged up. Point guard Kevin Porter Jr. is out due to a left ankle sprain sustained in the season opener against Washington. Kyle Kuzma is listed as doubtful after rolling his ankle late in the win over Toronto. Although head coach Doc Rivers described the injury as “not a bad one,” the team intends to be cautious early in the campaign. Adding to their troubles, guard Cole Anthony is questionable with a non-COVID illness, which could further thin out Milwaukee’s rotation and test their backcourt depth.The Cleveland Cavaliers , currently 1-1, also have a number of key absences. All-Star guard Darius Garland will miss another game with a left toe injury, while Max Strus remains sidelined due to a left foot fracture. Forward De’Andre Hunter continues to be questionable as he works his way back from a lingering knee issue and has yet to appear this season.Even with their injury woes, Cleveland’s core players have stepped up impressively. Donovan Mitchell dropped 35 points in Friday’s win over Brooklyn, while Jarrett Allen delivered a strong double-double with 22 points and 11 rebounds. The Cleveland Cavaliers’ offense has been humming early, averaging over 120 points per game, though their defensive consistency will be put to the test against Milwaukee’s high-powered attack.Through two games, the Milwaukee Bucks have been one of the league’s hottest offensive teams, averaging 127.5 points per game. Giannis has been a force inside, while Kuzma’s floor spacing and the team’s improved ball movement have given Doc Rivers’ squad a balanced look. Even if Kuzma is sidelined, the Milwaukee Bucks’ up-tempo offense remains a handful for any opponent.Cleveland, meanwhile, has struggled defensively, giving up 121.5 points per contest in their first two outings. Without Garland’s steady playmaking, the Cleveland Cavaliers have leaned heavily on Mitchell’s one-on-one scoring to create offense. Still, playing at home gives Cleveland a narrow betting edge of 6.5 points, particularly given the uncertainty around Milwaukee’s health.","Giannis Antetokounmpo is expected to play despite a left great toe sprain.

Jannik Sinner continued his remarkable 2025 season on Sunday, clinching his fourth title of the year with a thrilling comeback against Alexander Zverev in the Vienna Open final. The Italian, recovering from a first-set deficit, overcame the world number three 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 to secure the 22nd ATP crown of his career.Sinner dropped the opening set after Zverev produced the only break in a tight first set. “It was such a difficult start in this final for me,” Sinner admitted. “I went a break down, had some chances in the first set but couldn't use them. He was serving very well, but I just tried to stick there mentally and play my best tennis when it came.”The top seed responded emphatically in the second set, racing to a 3-0 lead and forcing a decider against the 2021 champion. The third set proved a tense battle as Zverev saved two break points in the fifth game, but Sinner’s persistence paid off. Battling a thigh issue, he secured a crucial break at 5-all with a blistering backhand down the line and a long rally win, before closing out the match with a routine hold.This victory marked Sinner’s second Vienna Open title, following his triumph in 2023, and extended his winning streak on indoor hard courts to 21 matches. The 24-year-old has now reached the final in eight of ten tournaments this year, adding to his titles at the Australian Open, Wimbledon , and Beijing.“The third set was a bit of a rollercoaster, but I was feeling the ball very well at times, so I tried to push and I’m very happy of course to win another title,” Sinner said. “It’s very special.”With momentum firmly on his side, Sinner heads into next week’s Paris Masters 1000 as one of the favourites.","Jannik Sinner beat Alexander Zverev 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 in the Vienna Open final.

'It ticks all the boxes'

The ATP announced on Thursday the creation of a new Masters 1000 event which will take place annually in Saudi Arabia from as early as 2028.The new event will be played on hard courts and take place ""at the start of the season"" in a city yet to be determined, and will last ""one week"", ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi said at a press conference in Paris.The long-expected move marks the first ever expansion of the top-tier category of men's tennis since its creation in 1990.The Saudi tournament will join the nine existing Masters events, which take place in Indian Wells, Miami, Monte Carlo, Madrid, Rome, Toronto/Montreal, Cincinnati, Shanghai and Paris.Gaudenzi called the expansion to 10 events ""a proud moment for us and the result of a journey that's been years in the making"".The addition of another tournament to the tennis calendar comes at the end of a season marked by complaints from some players about the demanding pace of the tour, whose tournaments run from January to November.However, unlike the majority of its counterparts, the new Saudi tournament will not be a mandatory event.""Our open system has a lot of pros because it provides a lot of freedom, options and choices for the players"" in choosing which tournaments they want to compete in, said Gaudenzi.""But the downside is that they obviously can't play Slams, Masters, (ATP) 500s, 250s freely.

Tennis star Jannik Sinner secured a commanding victory against Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarter-final round of the Six Kings Slam exhibition tournament in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia , but the match witnessed a security incident when a fan breached protocol to approach the Italian.The defending champion needed only 76 minutes to defeat Tsitsipas, dropping just five games in a dominant performance that set up a semi-final clash with Novak Djokovic.The match itself proceeded smoothly until its conclusion when cameras captured an unauthorised spectator rushing onto the court to approach Sinner during his post-match interview.Sinner initially engaged with the individual, shaking hands and attempting conversation, before realising the person was not tournament staff but rather a fan who had managed to bypass security to request his jacket.The situation, while ultimately harmless, ended with security personnel physically removing the intruding fan from the court area.The incident has raised concerns about security standards at the high-profile exhibition event in Saudi Arabia, with tennis fans drawing parallels to the 1993 Monica Seles incident in Hamburg where she was stabbed by an attacker who breached court security.This marks the second recent security-related incident involving Sinner, following a similar occurrence at the US Open where a fan attempted to access his tennis bag while he was signing autographs.Sinner's performance on court demonstrated his continued strong form, showing no lingering effects from his recent withdrawal from the Shanghai Masters due to injury.","Jannik Sinner defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarter-final round of the Six Kings Slam exhibition tournament in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

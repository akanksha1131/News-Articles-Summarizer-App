Jasprit Bumrah vs Injury: Untold story of why Indian cricketers fear getting hurt

KOLKATA: The Indian team was scheduled to begin their practice at 9:30 am at the Eden Gardens on Tuesday. They started half-an-hour earlier. Skipper Shubman Gill went straight to the pitch, bending low to fathom its character. Jasprit Bumrah headed for the bowlers net, limbering up for a session that lasted almost two hours.“Bumrah is extremely hard working and likes getting down to business as soon as he can,” Devang Gandhi, who was a national selector when the pacer made his Test debut in 2018, told TOI. Bumrah is all set to play his 51st Test here from Friday, when India take on South Africa. In an eight-year long career that has been hit by a few injuries, which have even forced him to be selective, he has grabbed 226 wickets so far and looks good for a lot more.Bumrah was among the most visible players in India’s nets on Tuesday and bowled mostly with a short run-up. “He has just come off a white ball series in Australia and for Tests, he has to prepare differently,” Gandhi said. “In the nets, he would be concentrating on length balls and probing the off-stump.”Bumrah started off with three stumps, knocked off two and consistently went after the sole one remaining upright. He did go for the imaginary off-stump, guiding the ball away, as if trying to induce the batter to follow it.Once the bowlers’ net got crowded, he shifted to the batters’ one to send down a few.“That’s the kind of effort he puts in,” Gandhi added. Despite having talent in abundance, Bumrah clearly believes in practice to achieve perfection. And in this quest, if he has to be selective, you cannot grudge him, feels Gandhi. “It might seem he misses crucial games now and then, but in the long run, India stand to benefit from his presence,” he said.Another former cricketer opined that preserving Bumrah as long as possible was crucial for India. “If he is not there, it is as good as half the attack not being there,” he said. Not that Bumrah has always been successful. There have been matches where the batters have gone after him and succeeded.Eden could find Bumrah at his best, especially as the curators have tried to ensure that the bowlers are not left feeling like the unwanted child. “If he finds some help, he might prove to be a handful,” Gandhi said.Tuesday’s practice was optional and quite a few of the players who turned out in the ‘A’ games against South Africa opted to take a break. While Rishabh Pant, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Kuldeep Yadav were among those who stayed away, Sai Sudharsan had a feel of the Eden Gardens. And those who flew in from Australia following the white-ball series there, like Gill, Washington Sundar and Nitish Kumar Reddy, spent some quality time at the nets.","Jasprit Bumrah was among the most visible players in India’s nets on Tuesday.

No off days as captain Shubman Gill, coach Gautam Gambhir arrive in Kolkata for Test series

Poll Do you believe Harshit Rana's inclusion in the squad is based on merit? Yes, purely based on his performance. No, I think favoritism played a role.

NEW DELHI: India head coach Gautam Gambhir has been under fire, with a section of fans and critics alleging that young pacer Harshit Rana’s inclusion in India’s ODI and T20I squads against Australia was due to their Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) connection. Now, former KKR wicketkeeper-batter Manvinder Bisla has come out strongly in defence of both Gambhir and Rana, calling the criticism unfair and baseless.Speaking on the Indian Cricket Canteen YouTube channel, Bisla dismissed the “favouritism” narrative as nothing more than social media noise amplified by non-KKR supporters.“The ones opposing Harshit Rana must be non-KKR fans. I am saying this honestly. Everyone relates it this way that Gautam has a KKR background, that’s why he is supporting Harshit. Koi mama chacha ka rishta to hai nahi (Gambhir is not his uncle). Everyone thinks there might be a KKR angle,” Bisla said.Bisla, who shared the dressing room with Gambhir during KKR’s title-winning run in 2012, said the coach has always valued performance over proximity. He reminded critics that Rana had earned his spot purely on merit, having emerged as India’s leading wicket-taker in the ODI series against Australia, while also showing his batting ability with 35 runs off 33 balls in the second T20I.The former wicketkeeper also highlighted how Rana’s brilliant four-wicket haul in the third ODI at Sydney set up India’s victory — even if the spotlight ultimately went to Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli .“India beat Australia in Sydney. All the influencers on social media, cricketers, non-cricketers, everyone spoke about RoKo. Did anyone speak about Harshit? If he had not set it up, what would have happened? Maybe RoKo would have still won us the match. But it was someone else who set up the match. If someone made a video on Harshit, would he have gotten those many views?” Bisla asked pointedly.",Former KKR wicketkeeper-batter Manvinder Bisla has come out strongly in defence of both Gambhir and Harshit Rana.

Sanju Samson IPL trade: How conversations moved from DC to CSK, and included Ravindra Jadeja

NEW DELHI: With the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2026 retention deadline approaching on November 15, excitement is at fever pitch. Franchises are finalising their lists, while fans speculate which big names might be released into the auction pool in December.Amid this buzz, former India cricketer and ex-Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) player Mohammad Kaif has weighed in on a fascinating hypothetical — who would fetch the highest bid if Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Jasprit Bumrah all entered the auction together?Kaif’s answer was clear and emphatic — Jasprit Bumrah.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Kaif argued that Bumrah’s match-winning impact makes him a generational player, even more valuable in auction dynamics than the superstar batters.“Among the three, Jasprit Bumrah would get the most money. Bumrah will get a lot of money because a bowler like him comes once in a generation. The kind of work he does for his team is exceptional,” Kaif said.He acknowledged Virat Kohli’s unmatched stature off the field but drew a sharp distinction between brand value and cricketing value.“Virat the batter, maybe you can find others like him, but Virat the brand — that continues.Nowadays, Virat the brand carries immense value,” he explained.Kaif further noted that IPL teams operate with a business-first mindset and view top players as both performers and commercial assets.“Whichever franchise joins the IPL or buys a team, they come to do business. They have invested money, so they want to earn money. It’s simple. They haven’t come here to do anyone a favour or to groom players, all that is nonsense,” he added.However, when it comes to pure match-winning influence, Kaif put Bumrah well ahead of both Kohli and Rohit.“If you ask who the biggest match-winner is among them, I would put Bumrah far ahead of Virat,” he concluded.","The Indian Premier League (IPL) 2026 retention deadline approaching on November 15.

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has suggested three potential replacements for Chennai Super Kings (CSK) as the franchise faces the reported departures of Ravindra Jadeja and Sam Curran to Rajasthan Royals. The players Ashwin believes CSK could target ahead of the IPL 2026 auction in December include Nitish Rana, Venkatesh Iyer , and Cameron Green.Jadeja and Curran have reportedly given their consent to CSK to proceed with the final phase of their trade move to Rajasthan Royals, creating key gaps in the Super Kings’ lineup that will need to be filled ahead of the new season.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ashwin proposed that Rajasthan’s Rana or Kolkata Knight Riders’ vice-captain Iyer could be ideal candidates for the No. 3 batting position, while Australian all-rounder Green could bolster the middle order.“CSK can really strengthen this side. The moment Sam Curran and Ravindra Jadeja have gone there (to RR), I see Nitish Rana coming into the auction. So, Nitish Rana and Venkatesh Iyer will 100% be on the radar of CSK. If Samson and Ruturaj open, it'll be the best thing to happen. At 3, they'll look at Venkatesh Iyer or Nitish Rana. Brevis and Dube will be at 4 and 5, and then they'll try to insert Cameron Green at 6 because recently he has batted in the middle order for Australia,” Ashwin explained.“Venkatesh Iyer has played one or two good innings in Chepauk. However, he is a replica of Shivam Dube with long levers down the ground. But he can play the sweep and reverse sweep. Nevertheless, someone like Nitish Rana, who is shorter, can access the square boundaries and use the bounce, and is an attractive option. There is a great chance he will come to CSK,” Ashwin added.While Green is expected to be available in the auction, CSK must wait until November 15 to find out whether Rana and Iyer will be retained by their current franchises.With Sanju Samson’s expected arrival, CSK’s batting lineup could see several combinations, providing flexibility for him and Ruturaj Gaikwad to interchange positions at No. 3.Young opener Ayush Mahtre has already made an impression in IPL 2025, scoring 208 runs in six innings at a strike rate of 185.71, including a standout knock of 94.CSK also have overseas options in Rachin Ravindra and Devon Conway, both established top-order batters who add further depth to the squad.","Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has suggested three potential replacements for Chennai Super Kings.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan batter Azam Khan , son of former cricketer Moin Khan , has opened up about the lowest phase of his international career, recalling the struggles he faced during his stint with the national team — especially a forgettable match against England in 2024.Despite featuring in 14 T20Is between 2021 and 2024, Azam failed to register a single half-century and often drew criticism for his fitness and fielding, leading to his exclusion after Pakistan’s disappointing 2024 T20 World Cup campaign.Azam’s time with the national side was marked by inconsistent performances and questions over his wicketkeeping.His last appearance came during the 2024 T20 World Cup, where Pakistan crashed out before the semi-finals.In a recent video interview, Azam revisited one of his toughest experiences — facing England’s express pacer Mark Wood ""Mark Wood ne mujhe pehla bouncer mara. I left it. I was like, ha theek hai. Matlab sahi hai. Humare yahan bhi 150 wale bowler hain (Mark Wood bowled the first bouncer. I left it. I thought, okay, we have 150 kph bowlers in Pakistan too),"" Azam Khan was heard saying in a video.""When he bowled the second bouncer, I was like, woah, yeh matlab kya ho gaya mere saath? Like meri zindagi ekdum ruk gayi, bhai yeh mere saath kya ho gaya!!!?? (When he bowled the second bouncer, I thought, what just happened to me? My life paused for a moment, and I was stunned).""He also recalled a painful moment at The Oval, where he faced brutal criticism from the crowd.""When my finger started hurting, I knew I was out. Oval ka crowd gaaliyan de rha tha (The Oval crowd started abusing me). There was a Pakistani reporter who asked a drunk Englishman about his favourite Pakistan player. He replied, 'Azam Khan, he can't bat, can't field.' That broke me. Kya yeh izzat hai meri? (Is this my reputation?) I dropped easy catches too. I was in tears. I kept thinking, yeh mere saath kya ho raha hai?

Shreyas Iyer’s condition critical after suffering life-threatening injury in Sydney | Inside details

NEW DELHI: Star Indian batter Shreyas Iyer has finally broken his silence after suffering a scary spleen injury during the third ODI against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on October 25. The Indian ODI vice-captain, who spent nearly a week in hospital — including a few days in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) — took to social media on Monday to share his first picture since the incident.In his Instagram post, Iyer offered a wave of relief to anxious fans, posting a cheerful picture from a beach alongside a friend. The caption read, “Sun been a great therapy. Grateful to be back. Thanks for all the love and care.”The post marks the first public update from the 30-year-old since his near-fatal fall while taking a running catch to dismiss Alex Carey during the Sydney ODI. Iyer landed awkwardly and was in visible pain before being rushed to the hospital. Later, it emerged that he had suffered a spleen laceration, an injury that caused internal bleeding and required an emergency medical procedure.According to medical reports, Iyer’s vitals had dropped dangerously low, prompting his ICU admission. Swift intervention by the Indian team’s medical staff and local doctors in Sydney proved crucial. He was discharged on November 1, though he stayed back in Sydney for follow-up treatment, accompanied by his sister Shreshta Iyer.A BCCI official had stated that talk of a cricketing comeback was “premature,” adding, “Physical and mental well-being is of utmost importance right now. There’s no question of thinking about cricket at the moment.”In its official statement, the BCCI had thanked Dr Koroush Haghighi in Sydney and Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala in India for their roles in Iyer’s treatment. The star batter’s recovery will determine his return timeline, though he is expected to miss the upcoming ODI series against South Africa starting November 30.For now, Shreyas’ heartfelt message — and his smile in the sun — have offered fans the best news yet: he’s healing, and grateful to be alive.",Indian ODI vice-captain Shreyas Iyer posts first picture since injury.

Afghanistan cricketer on air strike by Pakistan, constant support from India

NEW DELHI: Pakistan rode on a fighting unbeaten century from Salman Agha and a four-wicket burst by Haris Rauf to clinch a six-run win over Sri Lanka in the opening ODI on Tuesday, taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Agha’s fluent 105 not out off 87 balls powered Pakistan to 299/5, before Rauf’s 4/61 helped restrict Sri Lanka to 293/9 in a tense finish.The match was played under tight security after a suicide attack earlier in the day in nearby Islamabad, which claimed at least 12 lives. The Pakistan Cricket Board confirmed that security around the Sri Lankan team was further strengthened following the incident.Put in to bat, Pakistan were struggling at 95/4 before Agha and Hussain Talat (62) staged a brilliant recovery with a 138-run fifth-wicket partnership. Talat’s maiden ODI fifty featured one six and six fours, while Agha’s knock included nine boundaries, steering the hosts to a strong finish alongside Mohammad Nawaz (36 off 23)* — the duo adding 104 runs in the last 10 overs.Earlier, Wanindu Hasaranga (3/54) had rattled Pakistan’s top order, removing Fakhar Zaman (32), Babar Azam (29) and Mohammad Rizwan (5) in a fiery spell. Asitha Fernando struck early, trapping Saim Ayub for six.In reply, Sri Lanka made a solid start through Kamil Mishara (38) and Pathum Nissanka (29), who shared an 85-run opening stand. But Rauf turned the game with a decisive spell, dismissing both openers and Kusal Mendis (0) in quick succession.Sadeera Samarawickrama (39) and Charith Asalanka (32) revived the chase briefly, but Rauf’s fourth wicket — Samarawickrama, brilliantly caught by Babar Azam at slip — tilted momentum back to Pakistan.Down to 210/7, Sri Lanka’s hopes rested on Hasaranga, who fought valiantly with a 52-ball 59 featuring seven fours. His late charge brought the target down to 21 off eight balls before he holed out, ending the visitors’ resistance. Janith Liyanage contributed 28 with two sixes and as many fours.Pakistan skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi hailed his side’s fightback:“Agha and Talat batted really well to take us to 299. A target of 300 was good, and Haris gave us crucial breakthroughs,” said Shaheen.Sri Lanka captain Charith Asalanka admitted his bowlers leaked runs at key moments:“The way Agha and Talat batted took the game away. We gave away too many runs — it should have been under 270,” he said.The remaining ODIs will also be played in Rawalpindi, on Thursday and Saturday.",Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by six runs to take 1-0 lead in three-match series.

Sourav Ganguly gives an update on Mohammed Shami, says he is 'bowling exceptionally'

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly said on Monday that Mohammed Shami should return to the national team in all formats. Ganguly said Shami is fit and bowling well, but the selectors appear to be looking beyond the 35-year-old pacer, who has not been picked for the upcoming two-Test series against South Africa. Shami last played for India in the Champions Trophy in March.""Shami is bowling exceptionally well. He is fit and we saw in the three Ranji Trophy matches, where he's won Bengal on his own,"" Ganguly said on Monday.Shami took 15 wickets for Bengal in the first two Ranji Trophy matches this season. He bowled 91 overs in the three matches, going wicketless in the game against Tripura.Shami had undergone ankle surgery after the 2023 ODI World Cup, where he ended as the leading wicket-taker with 24 wickets at an average of 10.70.""I'm sure the selectors are watching and there is a communication between Mohammad Shami and the selectors. But if you ask me, in terms of fitness and skill, it’s the Mohammad Shami we know of. So, I really don't see any reason why he can’t keep playing Test matches, One-day cricket and T20 cricket for India. Because that skill is enormous,” Ganguly said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Prasidh Krishna and Akash Deep are now key members of the pace attack in Tests.With the 2027 ODI World Cup still two years away, Shami’s injury history could be a factor for the selectors.Shami, 35, has not been picked in India’s 15-member squad for the two home Tests against South Africa, starting Friday at Eden Gardens in Kolkata. Before this, Shami had expressed his disappointment over not being part of India’s recent Test matches.","Former India captain Sourav Ganguly says Mohammed Shami should return to the national team.

Afghanistan cricketer on air strike by Pakistan, constant support from India

Pakistan are set to face Sri Lanka in a three-match ODI series beginning Tuesday at Rawalpindi, looking to maintain their winning momentum.Newly appointed ODI captain Shaheen Shah Afridi recently led Pakistan to a 2-1 victory over South Africa at home in Faisalabad.""Going into the Sri Lanka series, our focus is to carry that winning momentum forward,"" Afridi said at Pindi Cricket Stadium, which hosts all three ODIs this week. ""We want to build consistency in our performances and make sure that we keep improving as a team in every department.""Pakistan's ODI performance in 2025 has been disappointing, leading to Afridi replacing Mohammad Rizwan as captain before the South Africa series. They lost bilateral series against New Zealand and West Indies, were defeated in the tri-nation series final by New Zealand, and failed to reach the Champions Trophy semifinals on home soil.Pakistan struggled in ODIs during 2025, losing 10 out of 14 matches. Afridi emphasised the need for team responsibility in the 50-over format.""All the players should take responsibility,"" he said. ""It's not Shaheen, Fakhar (Zaman), Babar (Azam), or Saim's (Ayub) job, we all should do our best.We should even back those players who are not performing and always believe that we can perform as a team.""Young batsman Saim Ayub impressed against South Africa with two half-centuries, including a top score of 77 in the decisive third ODI chase of 144. Babar Azam managed only 45 runs across three innings, while Fakhar Zaman scored 45 in the first match followed by two ducks. The Pakistan batting lineup saw contributions from Salman Ali Agha with two fifties and Rizwan's 55 against South Africa.""I was really proud of the way the players responded to different situations and played as a unit (against South Africa),"" Afridi said. ""The energy, intent and teamwork were outstanding.""Sri Lanka, ranked fourth in ODI rankings above fifth-placed Pakistan, enters the series after successful home wins against Australia and Bangladesh, plus an away victory over Zimbabwe.Sri Lanka has named a full-strength squad under Charith Asalanka's leadership, unlike South Africa who toured without seven key players. Only fast bowler Dilshan Madushanka is absent due to injury, replaced by potential debutant Eshan Malinga.""That's always a tough series when it comes to Pakistan, their home, their conditions,"" Asalanka said. ""Pakistan played good cricket in their last series and we too. We played 30-45 days ago in Zimbabwe and done really well, especially our ODI side has been doing really well.""Pakistan is expected to prepare batting-friendly wickets to counter Sri Lanka's spin trio of Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, and Jeffrey Vandersay.The ODI series will be followed by a T20 tri-series featuring Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Zimbabwe in Rawalpindi and Lahore, beginning November 17.",Pakistan face Sri Lanka in a three-match ODI series beginning Tuesday in Rawalpindi.

IND vs SA 1st Test: Will reverse swing hold the key at Eden?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-south-africa/ind-vs-sa-1st-test-will-reverse-swing-hold-the-key-at-eden/articleshow/125239976.cms,"India take on South Africa in the first Test of the two-match series from Friday.

KOLKATA: Reverse swing could be a major factor at the Eden Gardens when India take on South Africa in the first Test of the two-match series from Friday. And who better than Jasprit Bumrah to make the old red ball swing late? The black soil pitch is quite hard without much grass four days before the Test starts and as per experts, there aren’t much indications that these characters will change drastically within this time.“Cracks are likely to appear here quite early, making the ball rough as the game progresses,” an expert told TOI. “That should help reverse swing, something which Bumrah will relish.”However, India will be aware that South Africa too have bowlers who can make the old ball talk and any condition will surely not be one-way traffic. “The wicket has consistent bounce and that will help the batters. In fact, it has all the makings of a good batting wicket,” he said.However, that can work for both teams. As South Africa proved in the ‘A’ match in Bengaluru, they have batters who can exploit good conditions too. Temba Bavuma had a good outing in Bengaluru. So did Zubayr Humza. And let’s not forget the likes of Aiden Markram and Tony de Zorzi, who have skills to negotiate Bumrah’s guiles. Shubman Gill , Rishabh Pant and KL Rahul will not be the only quality batters out there.As the curators bounced the ball on the surface to test its consistency, one suddenly kept low.“That was a crack, which will be taken care of before the Test starts,” the expert assured.Although the wicket is expected to offer spin, it will not be a rank turner. Even though India’s spin attack is among the most formidable in the game currently, South Africa too have their own arsenal in Keshav Maharaj and Simon Harmer. India might have to approach this game a bit differently from how they did against West Indies.India head coach Gautam Gambhir and batting coach Sitanshu Kotak had a look at the Eden wicket on Monday morning. They, however, did not offer any suggestions or directives. “They had a close look, discussed between themselves and left,” a member of the ground staff said. “They did not tell us anything.”Gambhir, however, hadn’t been too happy with the wicket in their last Test against West Indies in Delhi. The wicket had been on the slower side and Gambhir felt there should have been a bit more carry. The curators at the Eden assure of a better wicket with “something for everyone”. That would make the batters as well as the bowlers happy. After all, an even contest is what makes a match interesting.The expert also assured that it won’t be a three-day wicket. “We should see a proper five-day contest,” he said. Apparently some of the recent matches which have lasted less than three days (the Ahmedabad Test against West Indies to name one) haven’t gone down well with the broadcasters. They have complained to the BCCI about loss of revenue. The board is said to have conveyed to the host associations to make wickets that last the distance. “Although that cannot be assured, the curators always try to make wickets that do not break too fast.”Another issue at the Eden will be the light. Around this time of the year, the light starts fading here by 4 pm and a 9.30 am start would mean the floodlights might have to switched on towards the end. “That might alter the conditions a little,” the expert said.","India take on South Africa in the first Test of the two-match series from Friday.

No off days as captain Shubman Gill, coach Gautam Gambhir arrive in Kolkata for Test series

Poll Should Dhruv Jurel be included in India's Test XI against South Africa? Yes, he's in great form! No, stick with the existing lineup. Depends on the batting order.

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has joined the debate surrounding Dhruv Jurel's red-hot form and his potential inclusion in India's playing XI for the upcoming Test series against South Africa, starting November 14 at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata.Ganguly, speaking at an event, praised the young wicketkeeper-batter's purple patch but admitted that breaking into India's settled Test line-up will be a challenge.“He's playing well, isn't he? Rishabh is back and I don't know what the selectors are thinking. Basically, the spots are taken — two openers, (Shubman) Gill at four, Pant at five, KL (Rahul), (Ravindra) Jadeja are there. Players have performed. How easy will it be to open up a slot for Dhruv Jurel at this stage, I wouldn't know,” Ganguly said.“But it depends on whom they want to send at No. 3 — whether they want to go with Sai Sudharsan, or bring in our in-form Dhruv in. We'll find out.”The 24-year-old Jurel has made headlines with back-to-back centuries against South Africa A in Bengaluru, making a compelling case for selection. His remarkable consistency in red-ball cricket — over 1,000 runs in nine matches at an average above 80 — has turned him into one of India's most promising batting talents.The former skipper also tipped India as overwhelming favourites at home, highlighting the team's formidable spin attack and recent form.“Because India's spin attack is very good. And this young team went to England three months ago and played exceptionally well. It was a fantastic series — exceptional performances by Gill, Yashasvi (Jaiswal), Rahul, Pant. India are a bundle of talent,” Ganguly said.The two-match Test series will conclude in Guwahati from November 22 to 26, followed by a three-match ODI series.With Rishabh Pant returning from injury and Jurel in scintillating touch, the Indian selectors now face a happy headache — a contest between stability and form.","Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has joined the debate surrounding Dhruv Jurel's red-hot form and his potential inclusion in India's playing XI for the upcoming Test series against South Africa.

NEW DELHI: With three days left for the first Test between India and South Africa, the pitch at Eden Gardens has drawn attention. The match begins on November 14, and this will be India’s first Test at the iconic venue since 2019.Since the surface has not been used for a Test in years, the early signs of the pitch condition have raised questions.The Indian team started training on Tuesday in Kolkata. Shubman Gill, Jasprit Bumrah, Sai Sudharsan, Ravindra Jadeja, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Washington Sundar and Nitish Kumar Reddy took part in the optional training session.During practice, Indian team captain Shubman Gill was seen discussing plans with head coach Gautam Gambhir. Gill and Jaiswal spent time in the nets facing throwdowns, while Jaiswal, Jadeja, Bumrah, Sudharsan and Nitish Kumar Reddy worked on catching drills.After about three hours, Gambhir, Sitanshu Kotak, Morne Morkel and Gill inspected the centre pitch. Morkel and Gill checked the surface and then spoke with curator Sujan Mukherjee for around 15 minutes. Their reaction suggested they were not fully ""pleased"" with what they saw, news agency PTI reported.The pitch has not been watered for a week and looked dry and brown, with some grass patches.Later in the evening, after South Africa’s practice ended, CAB president Sourav Ganguly and other officials examined the pitch and spoke with curator Sujan Mukherjee. The ground staff watered the nearby pitches but left the main pitch dry.Earlier this season, in two Ranji Trophy matches at this venue, pacers Akash Deep and Mohammed Shami did not get much help on the first day, although Shami later found reverse swing.Ganguly has said that the team management has not asked for a “ rank turner ”.South Africa have a mix of pace and spin options. Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen lead the pace attack, while Keshav Maharaj, Simon Harmer and Senuran Muthusamy form the spin group. Harmer took 13 wickets, Muthusamy 11, and Maharaj 9 in the recent two-Test series against Pakistan. Muthusamy also scored 106 runs and was named Player of the Series.","The pitch has not been watered for a week and looked dry and brown, with some grass patches.

Ahead of the much-anticipated men's Ashes series in Australia, a heated debate has erupted over the limited preparation for the Three Lions, with England great Ian Botham warning that Ben Stokes 's side could find themselves underprepared for the challenges of Australian conditions.""Well, it’s not the way I would prepare,"" he said, speaking in Melbourne on Tuesday.Botham, a stalwart in the history of English cricket, was a part of two victorious tours of Australia in 1978-79 and 1986-87.Meanwhile, England batting coach Marcus Trescothick said his team is comfortable with limited match practice before the upcoming Ashes, explaining that not playing multiple warm-up games is now common in international cricket.England players have been reaching Perth gradually over the past week. The entire squad, including those who were on the limited-overs tour of New Zealand, trained for more than two hours at Lilac Hill in Perth on Tuesday.England will play a three-day match against England Lions, their ‘A’ team, starting Thursday in Perth. This will be England’s only warm-up fixture before the first Test begins next Friday at Optus Stadium.""It's the way that the series are generally done - for us and for other opposition teams - around the world nowadays,"" Trescothick said on Tuesday. ""With the volume of cricket that's played [elsewhere], you don't have the time for preparations like potentially playing two or three first-class games, which has happened in the past.""""I think you generally roll with a prep game, or some facilities - whatever you have available - and you go from there. Of course, most of the guys have been playing in New Zealand for us. Some of the guys have come out from England, but it's the way of the modern game nowadays.""Since Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes became head coach and captain, England have mostly avoided warm-up games and chosen training camps or intra-squad matches. The approach has worked so far, as they have won the first Test in each of their last five overseas tours, including series in India, Pakistan and New Zealand last year.The Ashes series in Australia is significant for England, who are trying to win an away Ashes series for the first time since 2011 and their first Ashes title overall since 2015.","England great Ian Botham warns that Ben Stokes's side could find themselves underprepared for the challenges of Australian conditions.

Poll How do you feel about the uncertainty surrounding the future of Indian football? Concerned Indifferent Hopeful for a resolution

NEW DELHI: India’s top footballers, including former captain Sunil Chhetri , goalkeeper and current skipper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, and defender Sandesh Jhingan, have issued an emotional public plea urging football authorities to restart the paused Indian Super League (ISL) season, warning that their “anger and frustration” has now turned into desperation.The players’ joint statement comes amid uncertainty surrounding the ISL’s immediate future, after the All India Football Federation (AIFF) last week confirmed that no bids were received for the league’s commercial and media rights following an open Request for Proposal (RFP) on October 16.In a heartfelt video message posted on social media, Jhingan said, “Where we are right now is not a delay anymore — it’s a standstill for coaches, fans, staff members, and players. We have worked too hard, sacrificed too much to let our season vanish in silence.”He added that the entire Indian football ecosystem was “hanging in uncertainty,” stressing, “Dreams are paused. Future being questioned. Every day we wait, Indian football bleeds. We need action, and we need it now.”A joint text statement shared by Chhetri, Gurpreet, and other ISL players read: “We, professional footballers who play in the Indian Super League, are coming together to make a plea — and more importantly to send the message that we stand united.To put it simply, we want to play, and now.”“Our anger, frustration and distress has now been replaced by desperation — desperation to play the game we love, in front of people who mean everything to us: our families, our fans.”Chhetri also shared on Instagram: “We are all standing shoulder to shoulder, willing to do whatever it takes to resurrect the sport we love.”The players urged the AIFF and its administrators to “do whatever it takes” to revive the season, with several top clubs like Mohun Bagan already halting training amid the uncertainty.As India’s football community waits anxiously, the AIFF’s Bid Evaluation Committee, led by Justice Nageswara Rao (retd), is expected to submit its findings on the failed bid process to the Supreme Court, which has been overseeing the league’s restructuring.“We’ve found ourselves in a very dark tunnel for long,” the players concluded. “We could do with a little light.”",India's top footballers have issued an emotional public plea urging football authorities to restart the paused Indian Super League (ISL) season.

A quiet evening stroll turned into an unforgettable moment for a couple in Barcelona when football legend Lionel Messi unexpectedly walked into the frame of their romantic video. The clip, showing Messi casually photo-bombing the couple mid-dance, has taken social media by storm.In the viral video, the couple can be seen dancing affectionately along a picturesque Barcelona street, when the woman suddenly spots Messi walking behind them with his entourage. Stunned, the two immediately stop, exchanging looks of disbelief as the Argentine superstar passes by.The sighting came just hours after Messi made a surprise visit to Camp Nou on Sunday night, his first appearance at his former home since leaving FC Barcelona in 2021. The 38-year-old Inter Miami captain shared emotional posts from the visit, sparking speculation among fans about a possible future reunion with his boyhood club.“Last night I returned to a place I miss with my soul. A place where I was immensely happy, where you guys made me feel a thousand times the happiest person in the world. I hope one day I can come back — not just to say goodbye as a player, as I never got to,” Messi wrote on Instagram.Messi, who recently led Inter Miami to a 4-0 victory over Nashville in the MLS Cup Playoffs, continues to add milestones to his career, notching his 400th career assist during the match.Barcelona, meanwhile, have resumed limited training at Camp Nou amid renovations.

Manchester City marked Pep Guardiola’s 1,000th game as a manager in style, cruising to a 3-0 victory over Liverpool to reignite their Premier League title charge on Sunday. At the other end of the table, Nottingham Forest boosted their survival hopes with a 3-1 win over Leeds.Erling Haaland missed an early penalty at the Etihad but made amends soon after, opening the scoring to set City on their way. Nico González doubled the lead before half-time, and Jeremy Doku — the standout performer — sealed the result with a third after the break.It was a fitting celebration for Guardiola, the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss, who has now racked up 716 wins in a glittering 17-year managerial career.With the win, second-placed City sit just four points adrift of leaders Arsenal, who dropped points after conceding a stoppage-time equaliser in their 2-2 draw at Sunderland on Saturday.It was a fitting celebration for Guardiola, the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss, who has now racked up 716 wins in a glittering 17-year managerial career.With the win, second-placed City sit just four points adrift of leaders Arsenal, who dropped points after conceding a stoppage-time equaliser in their 2-2 draw at Sunderland on Saturday.""My players gave me a good present with this performance against the champions. They all performed to the highest level,"" Guardiola said.""Proud to do it here in Manchester in front of my family, especially against Liverpool. I have a huge respect for that club.""City's seventh win in their last eight games in all competitions was a major blow to Liverpool's hopes of retaining the title.The troubled champions have lost seven of their last 10 matches in all competitions and trail Arsenal by eight points.They are marooned in eighth place after the momentum from successive wins over Aston Villa and Real Madrid dissipated into the rainy Manchester air.""We struggled a lot in the first half. It was obvious they were better than us,"" Liverpool boss Arne Slot said.""We need to improve but I didn't need this game to know this.""Haaland squandered a golden opportunity to put City ahead in the 12th minute when VAR ruled Doku was tripped by Liverpool goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili just inside the penalty area.Mamardashvili made amends as he dived to his left to save Haaland's spot-kick.But Haaland was unfazed by his miss and the Norwegian put City in front in the 29th minute.At the climax of a flowing 20-pass move that carried City from deep inside their own half, Matheus Nunes crossed towards Haaland, who rose above Ibrahima Konate to head home from 10 yards.It was Haaland's 99th Premier League goal since signing from Borussia Dortmund in 2022.Haaland has scored 19 times in 15 games in all competitions for City this season.Virgil van Dijk's headed equaliser late in the first half was controversially disallowed by VAR for offside against Andrew Robertson.""It is obvious and clear that the wrong decision has been made,"" Slot said.Gonzalez unloaded a long-range drive that deflected in off Van Dijk just before half-time.Doku delivered the knockout blow when he curled a superb strike past Mamardashvili from 25 yards in the 63rd minute.At the City Ground, Forest trailed to Lukas Nmecha's 13th-minute opener.But Ibrahim Sangare equalised two minutes later and Morgan Gibbs-White headed home after 68 minutes before Elliot Anderson scored a stoppage-time penalty.It was Forest's first league victory since beating Brentford on the opening weekend of the season in August.Nuno Espirito Santo was in charge of Forest then, before being sacked to make way for Ange Postecoglou, whose brief reign also ended with his dismissal before Sean Dyche took charge.Second-bottom Forest's maiden top-flight victory under Dyche's management lifted them to within one point of safety.Aston Villa thrashed Bournemouth 4-0 to make it five wins from their last six league games.Emiliano Buendia, Amadou Onana, Ross Barkley and Donyell Malen scored at Villa Park, while Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo had a penalty saved by Emiliano Martinez.Newcastle's miserable away form continued with a dismal 3-1 defeat at Brentford.Kevin Schade's 56th minute equaliser cancelled out Harvey Barnes' first half opener.Newcastle defender Dan Burn was sent off in the 73rd minute after conceding a penalty that Igor Thiago converted before the Brazilian struck again in stoppage-time.Newcastle are 14th and have failed to win an away league match in nine attempts since April.Crystal Palace and Brighton shared a 0-0 draw at Selhurst Park to leave both teams in mid-table.","Manchester City beat Liverpool 3-0 at the Etihad in Pep Guardiola's 1,000th game as a manager.

Real Madrid settled for a goalless draw against Rayo Vallecano on Sunday, maintaining their position at the top of La Liga. The result put them five points ahead of Villarreal and six points clear of Barcelona, who were scheduled to face Celta Vigo later.The derby match saw Rayo Vallecano put up a strong defensive display against the league leaders. While Real Madrid created more chances, the home team also had opportunities to win in what turned out to be a scrappy encounter.Rayo successfully contained La Liga's leading scorer Kylian Mbappe , while also keeping Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham in check. This marked Real Madrid's second dropped points in the league this season, following their Champions League loss to Liverpool at Anfield.""I want to keep growing, improving, with positive and constructive self-criticism -- this is Real Madrid, we all know where we are and what we want. We're in November, there's a long way to go, we need to be demanding of ourselves (but) also be measured,"" Alonso told reporters.The match began with Rayo showing early initiative as Andrei Ratiu tested Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Madrid gradually took control of the game, but Rayo remained resolute at their Vallecas stadium.Both teams had their chances in the first half. Raul Asencio missed a good heading opportunity, while Batalla made an impressive save to deny Vinicius.The home team effectively limited Mbappe's involvement, preventing the French striker from making his usual impact. At halftime, Madrid's coach Alonso substituted Dean Huijsen with Eder Militao.The second half saw De Frutos come close to scoring for Rayo, hitting the side netting from Pacha Espino's cross. Bellingham tested Batalla with a well-controlled shot, while Mbappe managed his first attempt on the hour mark.Valverde's long-range effort was saved by Batalla, and Alvaro Garcia fired over for Rayo. In the closing stages, Trent Alexander-Arnold made an appearance as he continues his return from injury.Arda Guler nearly broke the deadlock in stoppage time with a deflected shot, but Rayo held on for a point.""I'm happy with the team's work, and we had chances too to take all three points,"" Rayo Vallecano goalkeeper Augusto Batalla told DAZN.

Poll Should more overseas-born players be allowed to represent India in football? Yes, it enriches the team No, focus on homegrown talent Only if they have Indian heritage

NEW DELHI: Indian football took another step into a new era on Sunday as Ryan Williams, the Australia-born forward who recently became an Indian citizen, officially joined the national team camp in Bengaluru ahead of the AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Bangladesh on November 18.The All India Football Federation (AIFF) confirmed his arrival, saying, “Forward Ryan Williams and defender Jay Gupta have joined the senior men’s national team camp in Bengaluru.” The camp, led by newly appointed head coach Khalid Jamil, began on Thursday and has already welcomed overseas-based players Abneet Bharti and now Williams, reflecting a fresh and ambitious direction for Indian football.Williams’ inclusion adds international quality to the squad. The 32-year-old, who plays for Bengaluru FC in the Indian Super League, is known for his pace and technical ability — assets India will hope to harness in the must-win qualifier in Dhaka.Though the former Australian international’s decision to relinquish his Australian passport made headlines last week, his participation in the national camp marks the first official step towards his potential debut in Indian colours.The citizenship handover ceremony was held at Bengaluru FC’s training facility, where Williams received his Indian passport from captain Sunil Chhetri , a symbolic moment that underscored his commitment to his new home.“Honoured to make official what’s long felt true… India, I’m one of your own,” Williams had written earlier on Instagram.Born in Perth to a Mumbai-born mother and English father, Williams has previously represented Australia at U-20 and U-23 levels, and made a senior appearance in a 2019 friendly against South Korea.Before moving to India, he played for Fulham and Portsmouth in England.

I saw a film today, oh boy. It was a day in the life of superstar Erling Haaland — how he loves his eggs sunny side up and his morning coffee laced with maple syrup, drunk from a mug titled ‘good vibes only’. He can barbecue a mean ‘tomahawk’ steak, with a little help from his girlfriend Isabel, who assists with a bearnaise sauce. Does Gordon Ramsay live next door?There’s a bit about LED red light therapy also, and ice baths, along with a section on his liking for raw milk which reportedly unleashed this whole new debate in England. “It’s all about maintaining high energy levels, staying motivated and doing what’s best for both my body and my mind so I’m prepared for whatever comes next,” Haaland told TOI in an exclusive interaction facilitated by JioHotstar.So far, the documentary uploaded on his YouTube channel has 6.7m views. You can see the big bear, but you don’t see the little one. “My life has changed a bit since my son was born, so there are some new routines and responsibilities compared to previous seasons,” he added.Being a father and unwinding at home has definitely helped the 25-year-old reach a new level of prolificacy — Liverpool, beware, he has already scored 13 goals in 10 EPL games — and this bundle of joy has added more lightness to his power-packed frame.“I’ve never felt better,” Haaland had alluded to this welcome change after scoring five goals in a Norwegian demolition of Moldova in Sept. “You need the balance between focusing and the opposite — not focusing at all. ”The defender’s nightmare has another dream record to add to his collection. A goal against his old club Dortmund midweek saw him become the first player to score in five consecutive Champions League games for three different clubs, Salzburg his first love in the striker’s marauding run.No wonder, City coach Pep Guardiola has started comparing him to the untouchables Messi and Ronaldo, in terms of influencing a team. “I should not think I am something just because I’m scoring goals. I’m just Erling and this will never change,” Haaland gave some classic quotes, downplaying Pep’s tall praise.The ‘boyhood blue’ who was born a month after his father Alf-Inge joined the City of Maine Road, however, did say he was the ‘same Erling but with more experience’. And more guidance from the master teacher, who will be in charge of his 1000th game as a manager, against Liverpool at home this Sunday. “Since joining City, Guardiola has significantly helped me refine my movements and put myself in positions where I can score,” Haaland told TOI. “He’s a genius, and his support has played a big role in my development as a goal scorer.”Will he score and help City keep up with Arsenal and put daylight between them and Liverpool? “I try not to focus too much on other people’s expectations. It’s important to keep my mind clear, not overthink. There’s always pressure, but I prefer to stay in my own zone, whether things go as planned or not.”“I keep reminding myself to keep perspective,” said ‘Just Erling’, the 6ft 4in ‘kid’ from agrarian Byrne. His local hop to a Cheshire farm, among other things, keeps him grounded.(WATCH MANCHESTER CITY VS LIVERPOOL IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE ON NOV 9, LIVE & EXCLUSIVE ON STAR SPORTS NETWORK AND JIOHOTSTAR)","Erling Haaland is the first player to score in five consecutive Champions League games for three different clubs.

Pat McAfee defends his Veterans Day Trump interview



More NFL coverage

In celebration of Veterans Day, The Pat McAfee Show took its broadcast to Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island in South Carolina, where the energy was electric and patriotic. But what stole the spotlight wasn’t just the setting -- it was the unexpected 20-minute call-in from President Donald Trump . The ESPN show, known for its blend of humor, sports insight, and spontaneity, suddenly became the center of national attention. McAfee, known for his unapologetic approach, faced both praise and criticism for putting Trump on air during such a symbolic broadcast.The conversation between McAfee and Trump stretched beyond football. While much of it revolved around the holiday, the military, and sports, the president also mixed in political jabs, personal boasts, and comments on the Washington Commanders’ name change. There was light-hearted sports talk too -- Trump discussed his Ryder Cup experience, expressed his dislike for the NFL’s new kickoff rules, and even joked about coaching strategies. The show had a pep rally feel, with McAfee prompting Trump to shout “oorah!” to the Marines, which he enthusiastically did.After wrapping up the segment, McAfee directly addressed the critics who questioned his decision to host Trump. His defense was firm and unapologetic. “I would like to say though, for the media people that are going to be mad about that happening, that’s the President of the United States. It’s Veterans Day. He’s the Commander-in-Chief. Obviously, if we’re going to have the opportunity to talk to him, we’re going to,” McAfee said.He further revealed that he had also reached out to former President Barack Obama to join the show, but scheduling issues prevented it. “As soon as we found out this was an opportunity, I reached out to President Obama as well and his team to potentially come on. Because of scheduling and conflicts, they were very kind and obviously sent incredible hope for the veterans and were thankful… but because of his schedule, he wasn’t able to do that. But I did reach out.”McAfee later added that he hopes Obama will appear in the future, and made clear that Trump’s inclusion was not about politics but about honoring the day. “Listening to him talk about sports is cool. Because I think he is a legit sports fan,” he said.Despite the online backlash - including one fan calling it “trash” - McAfee stood tall. As he put it, “It’s Veterans Day. He’s the Commander-in-Chief. Obviously, if we have the opportunity to talk to him, we’re going to... and he’s hilarious!”",The Pat McAfee Show took its broadcast to Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island in South Carolina.

Jaire Alexander’s decision highlights the toll of the NFL grind



More NFl coverage

Pro Bowl cornerback Jaire Alexander has decided to step away from football to focus on his mental and physical well-being, according to Jay Glazer of Fox Sports. The move has taken many by surprise, coming less than two weeks after his trade from the Baltimore Ravens to the Philadelphia Eagles on November 1. The 28-year-old cornerback, once regarded as one of the NFL ’s most dynamic defenders, is now at a crossroads in his career as he contemplates his next steps.Dianna Russini of The Athletic added, “I’m told Jaire is contemplating retirement but for now is stepping away to think through his next steps.” Glazer echoed this, explaining that Alexander “has decided to step away from football to try to focus on getting himself right physically and mentally.” The decision follows a string of injuries and team changes that have hampered his once-promising trajectory.Jaire Alexander’s journey has been marked by brilliance, setbacks, and now, self-reflection. Drafted 18th overall by the Green Bay Packers in 2018, Alexander quickly established himself as a lockdown corner, earning two Pro Bowl selections and two second-team All-Pro honors. Over seven seasons in Green Bay, he recorded 70 pass breakups, 12 interceptions, and became the cornerstone of the Packers’ secondary during Aaron Rodgers’ final years with the team.But injuries began to take a toll. Since early October, Alexander hasn’t seen game action, and his short stint with Baltimore yielded just two games and five tackles before the trade to Philadelphia. The Eagles, in search of veteran depth, took a calculated risk by acquiring him and a 2027 seventh-round pick in exchange for a 2026 sixth-rounder.Eagles GM Howie Roseman later shared that the team had done extensive research and believed the move was worth the risk. The trade also marked a homecoming of sorts for Alexander, who was born in Philadelphia before moving to North Carolina as a child. However, just days after the deal, he was ruled out for the Packers game due to a “knee injury/coach’s decision.”Now, as Alexander takes a step back, the focus shifts from football to recovery and clarity. With 290 career tackles and a resume few can match, Jaire Alexander’s next chapter may not be about competition, but about rediscovery.","Jaire Alexander has decided to step away from football to focus on his mental and physical well-being, according to Jay Glazer of Fox Sports.

Donald Trump reignites debate on tradition versus safety in football’s evolving identity

More coverage on NFL:

Donald Trump has once again inserted himself into the heart of an NFL controversy, this time over the league’s revamped kickoff rule. Speaking candidly on The Pat McAfee Show, the 79-year-old President expressed his deep frustration with the NFL’s decision to alter one of football’s most iconic plays.Donald Trump, who has long prided himself on defending American sports traditions, argued that the new “dynamic kickoff” model strips away the energy, unpredictability, and excitement that defined the sport for generations. His remarks come as players, fans, and analysts continue to debate whether the league’s safety-driven reforms are eroding football’s identity.Donald Trump didn’t hold back, saying, “I do have to say and I'll probably get myself into a little trouble for this - I hate the kickoff in football. I think it's so terrible, I think it's so demeaning. I think it hurts the game. I think it hurts the pageantry. I told that to Roger Goodell.”He added that despite the NFL’s claims of improved player safety, “you still have guys crashing into each other,” calling the reform “the opposite of what the game should be.” The President emphasized that the traditional kickoff represented “the power of the game,” a symbolic and thrilling start to every matchup that should never have been altered.Under the 2024 rule changes, players are lined up closer together, and no one can move until the ball is caught or hits the ground, measures designed to reduce high-speed collisions. Yet Trump argues these tweaks have “hurt the game’s pageantry,” transforming what was once a dynamic, adrenaline-fueled play into a controlled formality.The NFL has yet to respond to Donald Trump’s comments, but his criticism has revived a long-standing debate among fans and former players. While some applaud the league’s effort to protect athletes, others believe the game’s spirit is being sanitized beyond recognition. For Donald Trump, the issue goes beyond rule, it’s about preserving football’s essence, unpredictability, and “beautiful chaos” that made America fall in love with the sport in the first place.","Donald Trump has voiced strong disapproval of the NFL's new kickoff rule, deeming it ""terrible"" and ""demeaning"" to the game's tradition and excitement.

More coverage on NFL:

Joe Alwyn is quietly making headlines again, but this time, it’s not for his acting. Months after his breakup with global pop sensation Taylor Swift, the Conversations with Friends star has been spotted in London with a mystery woman, sparking renewed speculation about his love life. The sighting comes as Swift celebrates her high-profile engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce, embracing what fans call her “lover-girl era.”Meanwhile, Alwyn, who has always preferred to keep his personal affairs out of the limelight, seems to be treading back into public attention with understated charm. As rumors swirl about his new companion, fans are eager to know if the British actor has finally moved on from his six-year relationship with Swift.According to celebrity gossip outlet Deuxmoi, Alwyn was recently seen attending a play in London, accompanied by filmmaker Lorene Scafaria, the director behind Hustlers and Seeking a Friend for the End of the World. The two reportedly left the venue together, keeping a low profile. However, the publication clarified that there’s no official confirmation of a relationship between them.Interestingly, another insider added that “He’s dating someone else.She’s Latin and went to a lot of his shows the past month.” The source described the woman as someone based in London, “not in the industry, but from a lot of money in Latin America.” She reportedly spends significant time in the UK and has been quietly attending Alwyn’s recent performances.Alwyn, who was previously in a six-year relationship with Taylor Swift before their split in April 2023, has kept his personal life private ever since. Those close to him have previously said he was uncomfortable with the intense media glare during his time with Swift. Now, it appears he’s treading more carefully while exploring companionship away from the spotlight.While Taylor’s romance with Travis Kelce continues to capture the world’s attention, Alwyn’s possible new relationship paints a quieter picture, one that reflects his preference for privacy over publicity. If rumors are true, Joe Alwyn might just be embracing love again, this time on his own understated terms.","British actor Joe Alwyn has been spotted in London with a mystery woman.

Taylor Swift’s fake $15.5 million donation goes viral amid SNAP funding fight





More coverage on NFL:



When Taylor Swift ’s name trends online, it’s usually because of a new song, a record-breaking tour, or her NFL love story with Travis Kelce . But this week, the internet turned her into a headline for a completely different reason, a fake donation claim that got way too real.A viral post on X claimed that Swift donated $15.5 million from a “nonexistent secret album” to food-equity charities, supposedly to help Americans struggling under new SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) restrictions. Only one small problem, it never happened.The claim tied Swift to a mysterious “Life of a Showgirl” album that, according to the post, was quietly released and its proceeds donated to fight hunger. But fact-checkers and Swift’s team quickly shut it down, there’s no record of any such album or donation.Still, the story spread like wildfire. The timing didn’t help either. It surfaced just as the Supreme Court began reviewing a major dispute over SNAP funding following a federal court order, reigniting debate over food aid for 42 million Americans.For many online, the rumor sounded just believable enough. Swift’s history of real-life generosity (from paying tour crew bonuses to donating to food banks) made the false story feel almost on brand.Beyond the celebrity buzz, the post spotlighted a very real crisis. The SNAP program, which provides food assistance to more than 41.7 million people has been under political and financial strain.Swift’s fanbase wasn’t about to let the moment go to waste. A group called Swifties for Hope launched a verified campaign encouraging fans to donate “$13 or whatever you can” to Feeding America and local food banks.Within days, they raised over $22,000, equivalent to around 220,000 meals for families in need. The irony? A fake post inspired real-world generosity, proof that Swifties don’t need a rumor to take action.This isn’t the first time a false celebrity donation has gone viral, but it may be one of the few that led to actual good. It highlights the messy relationship between misinformation and activism and how online communities can pivot a misleading trend into something meaningful.Even without a $15.5 million check, Swift’s fans made an undeniable impact.Taylor Swift hasn’t commented on the viral post, but her fandom’s response speaks for itself. The “fake news” may have fooled the internet, but it also turned into a moment of unity, empathy, and awareness around food insecurity.","A viral post on X claimed that Swift donated $15.5 million from a “nonexistent secret album” to food-equity charities.

Forget touchdowns for a second, Kansas City Chiefs rookie Xavier Worthy is out here scoring points where it matters most, in his community. The 21-year-old wide receiver, who was raised by a single mom, has launched a powerful initiative to support 61,000 single mothers across Kansas City. Through his foundation, The Worthy 1s, he’s not just giving money, he’s giving opportunities, resources, and a message that single moms don’t have to fight alone.Worthy’s story hits differently because it’s personal. He grew up watching his mom, Nicky Jones, work tirelessly to raise him while balancing multiple jobs. That drive and resilience are exactly what pushed him to the NFL and now, he’s paying it forward to moms just like her.According to KCTV5, there are more than 61,000 single mothers raising over 115,000 children in Kansas City. Worthy’s foundation is aiming to reach as many of them as possible with direct help through programs focused on financial empowerment, mentorship, education grants, and community engagement.The foundation’s programs, eight in total, include everything from back-to-school funding and youth mentorship to job-readiness workshops and family support events.The goal? To help moms gain stability, confidence, and community support while setting their kids up for brighter futures.Worthy has never been shy about crediting his mom for his success. She raised him as a young, single mother, doing whatever it took to keep their home steady. That backgroundWorthy said in a local interview.Those words are now translating into action. Whether it’s helping a mom pay rent, supporting her child’s school needs, or simply providing emotional support, Worthy’s approach is about long-term empowerment not just handouts.It’s rare to see an NFL rookie make this kind of impact off the field, especially in their first year. Fans have flooded social media with love for Worthy, calling him “the real MVP” and “the kind of player every city needs.” Chiefs Kingdom, already hyped about his blazing speed, now has another reason to celebrate him.This initiative also puts Worthy in great company, following the footsteps of stars like Patrick Mahomes and CJ Stroud, who’ve both used their platforms for meaningful community work.","Xavier Worthy has launched a foundation to support single moms in Kansas City.

Travis Hunter’s surgery ends a promising rookie campaign far too early

“He’s everything we hoped he’d be,”

“The kid’s competitive, smart, and resilient. He’ll bounce back stronger.

More coverage on NFL:



Well, this one hurts, literally and figuratively. The Jacksonville Jaguars have officially announced that rookie sensation Travis Hunter is out for the rest of the 2025 NFL season after undergoing surgery on his right knee. The 21-year-old underwent a successful procedure to repair an isolated lateral collateral ligament (LCL) injury, confirming the worst fears of fans who had been holding out hope for a quick return.Hunter’s injury occurred during a practice session on October 30, and the Jaguars wasted no time placing him on injured reserve. The team confirmed that no additional damage was found in the knee, which is a small relief, but his recovery timeline means he won’t be returning until spring 2026 at the earliest.Hunter’s debut season was shaping up to be one of the most exciting storylines in Jacksonville. The former Colorado standout, known for his rare two-way talent as both a wide receiver and cornerback, was adding a dynamic spark to the Jaguars’ lineup. He’d already built solid chemistry with quarterback Trevor Lawrence , showing flashes of the same game-breaking versatility that made him a college superstar.With Hunter sidelined, head coach Doug Pederson and the Jaguars staff will have to adjust both offensively and defensively.Expect veteran wideout Zay Jones and rookie Parker Washington to see expanded roles on offense, while defensive packages will likely lean more heavily on rotational corners like Tyson Campbell and Antonio Johnson.The timing couldn’t be worse for Jacksonville, which has been fighting to stay competitive in the AFC South. Hunter’s ability to play both sides of the ball offered the kind of flexibility few NFL teams ever get and now, that advantage is gone.According to the team’s official statement, Hunter’s surgery was successful, and his rehab is already underway. The Jaguars medical staff expects him to return to “full football activities within six months,” keeping him on track for training camp next year.Even though his rookie campaign has been cut short, the Jaguars made it clear they see Hunter as part of their long-term plans.a team source said.It’s a brutal break for both the Jaguars and their young star, but this chapter feels more like a setback than an ending.

Micheal Ray Richardson’s story of redemption beyond the NBA



The loss of Micheal Ray Richardson has left the NBA world mourning. The electrifying former NBA star passed away at 70 after a short battle with prostate cancer. Known as “Sugar” for his smooth game and effortless flair, Richardson’s death left many in the basketball community heartbroken, including Lakers legend Magic Johnson. The four-time NBA All-Star, who once dazzled crowds with his blend of scoring, defense, and swagger, spent his final days in Oklahoma surrounded by loved ones.Richardson’s passing has shaken a generation of players who saw in him both brilliance and redemption. The former New York Knicks and New Jersey Nets star carved a place in basketball history with unmatched athleticism and skill. His personal and basketball qualities made him a favorite among his peers and a force on the court.Magic Johnson paid a heartfelt tribute to his longtime friend, writing on X, “My good friend and 4-time NBA All Star Michael Ray Richardson passed away today. Michael Ray could do everything on the basketball court! He was so skilled and talented. He will be missed. I’ll be praying for the family. R.I.P.”Johnson’s words reflected the sentiments of many who played alongside or against Richardson. Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas called him “the player who gave me the most problems playing against him,” adding, “He was taller, just as fast, and could shoot from 3 and midrange.His post-up game was elite. Offensively, he had it all.” Former guard Quinn Buckner echoed that admiration, telling Andscape, “Back when he played in the NBA, the best guards were Magic [Johnson] and then Sugar. ”Richardson entered the NBA as the fourth overall pick in 1978 and quickly earned a reputation as one of the league’s most complete guards. Over eight seasons with the Knicks, Golden State Warriors, and Nets, he became a four-time All-Star and three-time league leader in steals. His 1985 season with the Nets, averaging 20.1 points, 8.2 assists, and 3.0 steals, remains one of the finest by a point guard in that era.Richardson’s career, though glittering, was marred by personal struggles that led to his lifetime ban from the NBA in 1986 for violating the league’s drug policy. But rather than fade into obscurity, he rebuilt his life overseas. He found success playing and later coaching in Europe, guiding teams to championships in Italy, France, and Canada.In 2024, Richardson published his memoir, Banned: How I Squandered an All-Star NBA Career Before Finding My Redemption, detailing his journey through hardship, recovery, and purpose. His attorney John Zelbst remembered him as “a great sportsman” who “overcame the most incredible odds to accomplish what he did.” Richardson’s demise has left a huge void, but he has built a career for which he will be remembered forever in the history books of the NBA.Also Read: Caitlin Clark’s golf round takes hilarious twist as Sophie Cunningham vows to heckle with beer in hand","Micheal Ray Richardson, a four-time NBA All-Star and three-time league leader in steals, has died at 70.

Shubman Gill named India's new ODI captain, replaces Rohit Sharma ahead of Australia series

Poll Do you believe Harjas Singh's success will inspire more immigrant cricketers? Yes, absolutely. Maybe, depends on visibility. No, individual efforts vary.

Family’s sacrifice

The change in technique

The future

NEW DELHI: Harjas Singh was Australia U-19's top scorer with a feisty 55 against India U-19 in the U-19 World Cup final last year. His timely knock helped Australia win the U-19 title for the first time in 14 years.Harjas’ teammate Sam Konstas went on to play Test cricket for Australia, debuting against India in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy last year. The likes of Oliver Peake, Harry Dixon, and Callum Vidler have been fast-tracked to Australia A. Meanwhile, Harjas has had to grind it out to make a name for himself.“Most of my teammates are playing for Australia A or are in the Australia squad. It makes no difference. Everyone has their own journeys, their own paths, their own timeframe,” the 20-year-old tells“I think credit to all of them. They’ve all worked extremely hard. Everyone’s on a different timeframe. You could still go pro at 25, or at 27, or you could go pro at 16, like some of the greats such as Sachin (Tendulkar),” he says.In the past week, Harjas has become the toast of Australian cricket. He has appeared on podcasts with former Australia captains Michael Clarke and Brad Haddin and earned a maiden New South Wales second XI call-up.He achieved all this after smashing a remarkable 314 not out from 141 balls — a whirlwind knock that featured 35 sixes and helped his club, Western Suburbs, post 483 for 5 against Sydney Cricket Club at Ashfield’s Pratten Park. The next-best scorer from his team made 37 as Western Suburbs won by 186 runs.Coming in to bat at No. 3 in the 11th over, the 20-year-old raced to his century in the 35th over, taking just 74 balls to reach the milestone. He then went on a stunning assault, smashing 214 runs off his next 67 deliveries. The knock became the third-highest individual score in NSW Premier first-grade history and broke a century-old record for the most sixes in an innings — surpassing Victor Trumper’s 22 for Paddington against Redfern in the 1902/03 season.Harjas was later informed that approximately $2000 worth of cricket balls had gone missing during his carnage. “It was fun,” he laughs.“Honestly, I have no idea how I hit those runs and sixes. After 100, my intention was to just hit every ball for six. And yeah, they just kept going, so I just kept swinging,” he adds.Harjas says that Australian Premier First Grade cricket is highly competitive and that this is where players earn contracts for Sheffield Shield teams and catch the attention of Big Bash League (BBL) franchises.“It’s one level below where you become a professional cricketer. All the professional cricketers from Australia who play state cricket are chosen from New South Wales first grade,” explains Singh, who was trained by Neil D’Costa in his early years. D’Costa has coached the likes of Michael Clarke, Phil Hughes, and Marnus Labuschagne , to name a few.Harjas comes from a family of sportspersons. His father was a state boxing champion in Punjab, while his mother was a long jumper. They left Chandigarh and moved to Australia in 2000.Being an immigrant with roots in Chandigarh, the 20-year-old grew up watching his parents, Inderjit Singh and Avinder Kaur, work tirelessly to support his cricketing dreams.“My parents are bus drivers, both of them,” he says.“For every parent who has a son who is a cricketer, sacrifices always have to be made — straight after work, taking them to training, late nights, early mornings, making sure their clothes are ready when they were younger. Financially, it’s a big thing too — buying pads, bats, all that stuff,” he says.Harjas still visits Chandigarh, where his uncle and other family members live.“I went to Chandigarh two years ago. We live in Sector 44-D. I still have family back in Chandigarh and Amritsar,” he says.A couple of years ago, in a podcast with SBS Punjabi, the youngster shared how he had to work harder than others because of his identity.“If you look different from others, you have to do something different and much more to maintain that identity and your place in the field,” he had said.Talking about his parents’ reaction after his record-breaking knock, Harjas says: “My family’s reaction was priceless. During the innings break, I spoke to my mom. She said, ‘I checked your score when you were on 260 and couldn’t believe it — my legs started shaking.’ And my dad, when I spoke to him, was in tears. It was quite emotional and special.”Harjas admits he has tweaked his technique recently, which has helped him hit those monstrous sixes.“I’ve definitely worked on it. It’s something I’ve focused on throughout the off-season. I’ve been doing that with my coach Darius (Visser) at Hype Cricket. It’s been in the works for about three or four months,” he says.This wasn’t the first time he has changed his technique.Harjas is right-handed in almost everything he does — except batting. The switch, he recalls, happened by chance during his childhood. As a kid, he used to bat right-handed in the backyard, but with glass windows on the leg side, there was always a risk of breaking them. To avoid that, he began batting left-handed and has stuck with it ever since. Interestingly, he still bowls right-arm medium pace and throws with his right hand.In his brief career, Harjas has also moved around a lot in the batting order.“I move around in different formats. For my club currently in Tier II, I open the batting. In one-day matches, I bat at number three, and in two-day games, I bat at number four,” he says.For someone so young, Harjas has a mature head on his shoulders and isn’t bothered by the attention he’s receiving.“After 35 sixes, there will be more eyeballs for sure. I’m not going to let that distract me from doing my job, which is scoring runs,” he says.“I don’t think it’s overwhelming,” he reasons.“I mean, it’s definitely something I’ll look out for in the future, which thankfully I’m ready for now. It has caught me a little off guard, but that’s all part of it, and it’s something I have to manage,” he adds.“When you’re on social media, you get all sorts of attention — good and bad. It’s a different skill to not let it affect you and to stay focused on what you need to do. Again, my main aim is to perform in the next match,” he says.When asked about his maturity, the youngster smiles: “I think it’s something I’ve ingrained into my speech and my actions. It hasn’t been easy, but it’s definitely been a journey.”On his podcast, Michael Clarke predicted that the youngster will soon receive contracts from IPL and BBL teams. But Harjas isn’t getting carried away — he knows consistency is key.“There’s a long way to go. One innings doesn’t define your career. You need consistency and back-to-back performances,” he says.“Honestly, I couldn’t tell you about my future or where I’ll be in a few years. My aim is to perform in the next match I play. I like to take things day by day and not look too far ahead,” he says.Harjas is a true Gen Z kid, unbothered about what the future holds. For now, he wants to groove to Karan Aujla’s hit song ""Gabhru,"" enjoy homemade Shahi Paneer, and promises to go after his own record.“I’ll go for it again for sure,” he signs off.",Harjas Singh was Australia U-19's top scorer with a feisty 55 against India U-17.

Poll Who do you think was more at fault in the run-out incident? Shubman Gill Yashasvi Jaiswal Both equally

India vice-captain Ravindra Jadeja shed light on the mix-up between Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal that led to the latter being run out on 175 during Day 2 of the second Test against West Indies at the Arun Jaitley Stadium.Jaiswal, who resumed on 173 from the previous day, added just two runs before being dismissed in the second over of the opening session.After punching a delivery from Jayden Seales to mid-off, he ran for a single. However, Gill sent him back, and Jaiswal appeared hesitant to sprint, allowing Tagenarine Chanderpaul to field quickly and relay the ball to wicketkeeper Tevin Imlach, who removed the bails.The incident divided fans, with some blaming Gill and others pointing to Jaiswal.Jadeja, however, called it a simple case of misunderstanding between the striker and non-striker.“No, there was nothing special. There was a misunderstanding, yes, no, yes, no, and a non-striker feels that there is no run; a striker feels that there is a run, so it goes on like that. There is nothing much, at the end of the day, it is a part of the game, it keeps happening. Thank God, we were in a good situation, even after that, the whole team was there and scored a big score,” Jadeja said after stumps.Jaiswal echoed Jadeja’s view, adding, “It's (run out) part of the game, so it's fine.”The 23-year-old had captivated spectators with a mix of caution and aggression. He started cautiously on Day 1 before accelerating in the second session, reaching fifty in 82 deliveries and completing his seventh Test century after adding another 50 runs in just 63 balls.Jadeja praised Jaiswal’s intelligent approach to batting, noting that the youngster knows which bowlers to attack and when to play certain shots.“Jaiswal is very clever in terms of his batting; he knows which bowler to attack, which bowler to play and take out, so I think his maturity level is very good. He doesn't try to hit every bowler, he has a very good idea of which situation to hit, which time to hit, so I think it's a good thing that when a batsman knows what shot he is going to play, when he is going to play, it stays in his mind and brings success,” Jadeja added.Team India opened their bowling attack with Kuldeep Yadav and Jasprit Bumrah. The hosts will look to wrap things up quickly to seal the series after setting up a massive 518/5 total before declaring.","Yashasvi Jaiswal lost his wicket to a run out on Day 2 of the 2nd Test against West Indies in India's first innings.

Poll Is Abhishek Sharma the most exciting young talent in cricket today? Absolutely Not really There are others just as good Too early to tell

NEW DELHI: In the aftermath of India's dominant Asia Cup campaign, Pakistan pacer Ihsanullah has thrown down the gauntlet to India's batting sensation Abhishek Sharma The 25-year-old Punjab-born batter, who amassed 314 runs in seven games at a strike rate approaching 200, has been hailed as the driving force behind India's continental title. Yet, Ihsanullah, famed for a 152.65 kmph delivery in the 2023 Pakistan Super League , believes he can rattle the world No. 1 batter.“If I get to play against India, I will dismiss Abhishek Sharma in 3–6 balls,” Ihsanullah declared in a viral video, sparking widespread debate among cricket fans. The fast bowler, who has already represented Pakistan in T20Is and an ODI before an injury interrupted his rise, added, “My 140 (kmph) will feel like 160 to him. He won't be able to judge them. To left-handers, I bowl inswingers, and he has struggled against such balls — that's why I am saying. I target the right shoulder of left-handed batters with my bouncers. And my bouncers are very effective.”Ihsanullah's confident pronouncements come as Abhishek Sharma enjoys a meteoric rise. The Sunrisers Hyderabad star has been in sublime form, notching three fifties in the Asia Cup and continuing a prolific T20I season with 593 runs at an average of 49.41 and a strike rate of 208.80 in 12 T20Is. His consistency has drawn praise from cricketing legends.Former West Indies great Brian Lara, who worked with Abhishek during the IPL as a batting coach, said, “He is an amazing young player… something very special. Yuvraj Singh had a big influence on him, his bat speed, the way he hits through the ball… Even though he's having success in T20 cricket and maybe even the 50-over format, he still wants to break into the Test team, which is great. It's great to see him improve and go to a different level.”As India prepare for a five-match T20I series in Australia starting October 29, all eyes will be on India’s newest batting sensation.","Pakistan pacer Ihsanullah has thrown down the gauntlet to India's batting sensation Abhishek Sharma.

IND vs WI 1st Test: Why West Indies' decision to bat first vs India backfired?

Poll Will Yashasvi Jaiswal score a triple century in his innings? Yes, he will achieve it! No, he won't reach that milestone.

NEW DELHI: India’s legendary spinner Anil Kumble lavished high praise on opener Yashasvi Jaiswal after the young left-hander’s unbeaten 173 lit up the opening day of the second Test against West Indies at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Friday. The former India captain went a step further — tipping Jaiswal to turn his marathon innings into a historic triple hundred on Saturday.“Jaiswal is just getting better and better day by day,” Kumble said on JioHotstar’s Amul Cricket Live. “We’ve spoken about his hunger and his attitude toward building big innings, not just for himself but for the team. Even in the previous game, he got off to a good start but was dismissed early, so he’s certainly made up for that here.”The 23-year-old southpaw, who has already amassed almost 2500 runs in just 26 Tests with seven centuries and 12 fifties, batted through the entire first day. His 173 came off 253 balls, decorated with 22 fours, and put India in command at 318/2 at stumps.Kumble, who has seen several modern greats from close quarters, lauded Jaiswal’s temperament and ability to convert starts into monumental knocks. “Throughout his short career, he has shown that he doesn’t waste opportunities like these.Once he’s in, he makes it count — and that’s wonderful to see,” he said.The veteran also pointed out Jaiswal’s rare consistency in producing big hundreds — five of his seven centuries have been scores over 150. Only Graeme Smith and Don Bradman have comparable numbers before turning 24.With the pitch flattening out and West Indies’ bowlers already looking fatigued, Kumble urged the youngster to aim even higher. “He’s still out there, and he can go on to score big runs tomorrow… Jaiswal now has a great opportunity, not just for a double hundred, but maybe even a triple hundred,” Kumble added.If Jaiswal does convert his unbeaten 173 into a triple century, he would become only the third Indian in history to do so — joining Virender Sehwag and Karun Nair.",Yashasvi Jaiswal scored unbeaten 173 on opening day of second Test against West Indies.

Both players looked visibly shaken, prompting medical staff to rush on for treatment.In a viral moment that has since taken social media by storm, Jaiswal was seen taking charge of Gill’s concussion check.

Poll Which team's performance impressed you the most in their latest match? Germany Northern Ireland France Switzerland

Germany, four-time World Cup winners, returned to winning ways on Friday, thrashing 10-man Luxembourg 4-0 to reclaim top spot in Group A. Captain Joshua Kimmich was the star of the show, scoring a first-half penalty and tapping in a second goal shortly after the break. David Raum’s precise free-kick and Serge Gnabry’s early second-half strike sealed the emphatic win for Julian Nagelsmann’s side.Germany, who endured group-stage exits in both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, showed a renewed poise and swagger missing from their earlier qualifiers. The victory moved them level on points with Slovakia and Northern Ireland, but ahead on goal difference. Luxembourg’s task became near-impossible after Dirk Carlson was sent off for a handball inside the box within the first 20 minutes, conceding the penalty that Kimmich converted.Northern Ireland kept alive hopes of a fourth World Cup appearance and a first since 1986, defeating Slovakia 2-0 at Windsor Park. An early own goal from Patrik Hrosovsky and a stunning late volley by Trai Hume secured the win. “It was a great night, good performance and the most important thing is the three points,” Hume said.In Paris, Kylian Mbappe continued his fine form at Parc des Princes, scoring just before halftime to mark his 10th goal in consecutive games for Real Madrid and France. Adrien Rabiot and the returning Florian Thauvin also scored as Didier Deschamps’ side eased past Azerbaijan 3-0, remaining unbeaten after three matches and leading Group D. Despite the win, Deschamps urged caution ahead of Monday’s clash in Iceland. “It’s three points more but perhaps not in the way we wanted… Monday will be another game, another context,” he said.Elsewhere, Switzerland maintained their perfect record in Group B, defeating Sweden 2-0, while Kosovo and Slovenia played out a goalless draw. Belgium, chasing a 13th World Cup appearance, were held 0-0 by North Macedonia, who currently top Group J after famously eliminating Germany from the 2022 World Cup qualifiers.With key wins and dominant performances from the likes of Germany, France, and Switzerland, the race for World Cup qualification in Europe is heating up, leaving fans eagerly anticipating Monday’s pivotal fixtures.","Germany thrash 10-man Luxembourg 4-0 to reclaim top spot in Group A.

'They pull our players away': Brian Lara explains West Indies cricket's decline

Poll What has surprised you the most about the pitches in this series? Not enough turn for spinners Good conditions for batting Quick finishes in previous matches

NEW DELHI: The pitches in Ahmedabad and now here have taken West Indies left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican by surprise, given that they are not the sort of rank turners which have led to mostly early finishes and made India’s home Tests a gamble in the recent past.Not so for India’s own spinners, who’ve known all along what to expect in this series. Ravindra Jadeja revealed after Saturday’s play that the team intentionally “did not ask” for the sort of dry, crumbling pitches where playing spin often becomes an impossibility, leads to early finishes, and leaves the opposition spinners too in with a whiff of a chance.Warrican seemed bemused that West Indies’ pre-series assessment of conditions here did not turn out to be accurate. “After watching the last couple of games between England and New Zealand, it was turning square from Day One. That was our expectation, but clearly, that’s not the case. In fact, Days One and Two seemed good for batting,” Warrican assessed.The West Indies cannot be faulted for getting their homework wrong. In the last two years, there have been rare blips in India’s enviable home record. Having lost the first Test against the Kiwis in Bengaluru, where they collapsed to the pacers for 46, India went on to lose the next two inside three days.In Pune, Washington Sundar bagged seven Kiwi wickets in the first innings, but India still lost by 113 runs as Mitchell Santner ran riot. In Mumbai, Ajaz Patel got into the act. India also lost to England in Hyderabad inside four days, with part-time spinner Joe Root bagging four wickets in the first innings and rookie slow left-arm spinner Tom Hartley bagging seven in the second.Earlier, Nathan Lyon and Matthew Kuhnemann ensured a win within three days for Australia in Indore. India’s spinners either declined in tandem or their batters were not good against the turning ball. “I’m not surprised because we’ve only asked for slow turners. We didn’t ask for rank turners,” Jadeja said.The flip side is the spinners have to work harder for wickets. “As we saw today, the bounce is low and there isn’t much turn on offer off the surface,” Jadeja said. “We’ve to use our shoulders a lot. Less pace makes it easy to adjust to the length or go on the back foot and work the ball. We now have to be a bit quicker in the air. Not every ball is turning. We’ve to work really hard for our wickets,” he added.","West Indies left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican surprised by turners in Ahmedabad.

by scoring five tons as skipper in a calendar year; Jadeja, Kuldeep strike as Windies reduced to 140/4 in reply to India's 518/5 declared

Poll Do you believe Shubman Gill has the potential to be India's next big batting superstar? Yes, absolutely! Maybe, but he needs more consistency.

NEW DELHI: On a day of freak dismissals and an equally freaky run of good form for Shubman Gill , the only variance to the expected script was a flutter of defiance from the West Indies with the bat, which came as a breath of fresh air.The rest played out on expected lines. India’s captain — never one to look a gift horse in the mouth — cashed in on the opportunity to flay a sub-par bowling attack with a 129 off 196 balls (16x4, 2x6), an innings at once elegant and compact.Gill, resuming on an overnight 20, was seen practising his bat swing with his bottom hand before play began. He carried his decisiveness to the middle, eliminating his earlier weaknesses against incoming deliveries by ensuring he kept bat and pad close, was disciplined in his footwork to get the timing going yet adventurous enough to often step out and mess with the bowlers’ lengths.Some remarkable flicks, backfoot punches, cover drives, cuts, and a lofted drive ensued. Gill played with rival captain Roston Chase’s field placing too, often hitting boundaries in a bunch, forcing changes and then guiding the balls through gaps to jaunt through to the second-highest average as captain after seven Tests after Don Bradman — a wildly impressive 84.41. He even replicated Kohli’s feat with his fifth century as captain in a calendar year.Gill’s knock and some quick 40s from a promoted Nitish Kumar Reddy and Dhruv Jurel carried India to 518/5 declared, and it’s a safe bet they won’t be required to bat again in this Test.Gill’s fluency was welcome after his partnership with Yashasvi Jaiswal ended on a bitter note and a messy mix-up. Jaiswal (175; 258b; 22x4) missed out on what many thought would be a certain double ton by guiding the eighth ball of the morning, from Anderson Phillip, to mid off and then rushing through to the danger end, where it seemed the prospect of a run never crossed Gill’s mind.Expectedly, Jaiswal couldn’t make his way back and stood shell-shocked before storming off with words exchanged, but that wasn’t the end of the drama — replays showed ’keeper Tevin Imlach barely had the ball in his gloves when he whipped the bails off! The incident reprised memories of Jaiswal’s equally confounding affair with Kohli in Melbourne late last year, though to be fair it was his call on both occasions.That wasn’t the only unusual dismissal on the day — West Indies opener John Campbell later slog-swept Ravindra Jadeja straight down the throat and helmet grill of forward short leg, where Sai Sudharsan miraculously held on, hurting his hand and going off in the bargain.Jaiswal cooled down enough by the end of the day to downplay his own incident, though, saying only that “it’s a part of the game, so it’s fine”. Gill putting on an exhibition for the Saturday crowd made up somewhat for the disappointment. These are, after all, potential ‘banana-skin’ encounters for India in which they’re simply expected to turn up and roll over the opposition. So it was a surprise to see Jadeja (3/37 off 14 overs) and Kuldeep Yadav having to work hard for their wickets when the West Indies batted, no thanks to the Kotla track, on which little seemed to happen off the surface.Alick Athanaze and Tagenarine Chanderpaul even put on the team’s first half-century stand of the series, frustrating the bowlers. Athanaze looked good for 84 balls and scored 41, the team’s highest individual score of the series, before the team again threw it all away. Some nervy strokes, back-to-back wickets between the first ball of the 33rd over and the third ball of the 34th — which got rid of Athanaze and skipper Chase — left the team staring at another early defeat at 140/4 by stumps.The soft dismissals were inexplicable and restored the status quo, leaving Gill to bask in the glory of a magnificent run of form. The knock reinforced the arrival of India’s next big batting superstar and unanimous choice of leader in this format. “It helps the team when the captain leads by example,” Jadeja later said. “Gill and Jaiswal are part of a new generation which believes in taking responsibility.”On this day, though, Jaiswal was left to rue what could have been, just like the Windies batters.","Gill scores 129 off 196 balls (16x4, 2x6), an innings at once elegant and compact.

Poll Is Yashasvi Jaiswal the future of Indian cricket? Definitely! Maybe, with more experience. Too early to say.

NEW DELHI: Yashasvi Jaiswal once again showcased his class with a sparkling 175 off 258 balls in India’s first innings of the second Test against West Indies at Delhi’s Arun Jaitley Stadium.The 23-year-old left-hander looked set for a double century, but a rare mix-up with skipper Shubman Gill brought his innings to an untimely end. Despite the premature dismissal, Jaiswal’s knock featured 22 boundaries and was a testament to his growing consistency and maturity at the highest level.Following the close of play on Day 2, Jaiswal interacted with the host broadcaster, where legendary former India captain Sunil Gavaskar could not resist offering his advice.While commentator Harsha Bhogle commended the young batter, saying, “Well done. Absolutely enjoyed your batting. Don’t mind how it ended, but we love watching you bat,” Gavaskar jumped in with his trademark wit.“I just want to add to that. Well done, keep it up. Keep getting the hundreds. Daddy hundreds, but because I am a grandfather, I’ll say keep getting granddaddy hundreds,” Gavaskar said, leaving Jaiswal momentarily speechless.This innings marked the fifth time in Jaiswal’s Test career that he went past 150 runs, placing him alongside Graeme Smith as the youngest to achieve such feats before the age of 24. Had he converted his score into a double century, it would have been his third in Tests, following two double centuries during the 2024 series against England.With his composure, shot-making, and growing ability to bat long innings, Jaiswal is quickly cementing his status as one of India’s most promising young batters, earning praise not only from fans but also from legends like Gavaskar.","Yashasvi Jaiswal scored 175 off 258 balls in India's first innings of the second Test against West Indies at Delhi’s Arun Jaitley Stadium.

India players unwind at head coach Gautam Gambhir’s residence | Massive crowd greets them

Poll Do you think cricket commentary should be considered a serious profession? Yes, absolutely! No, it’s just a side gig.

Have you ever wondered how much money cricket commentators make for their voice and insights on the game? Former India cricketer and popular commentator Aakash Chopra recently gave fans a rare peek into the economics of sports broadcasting during a conversation with entrepreneur and influencer Raj Shamani.When asked about a commentator’s yearly income, Chopra explained that the pay structure generally depends on experience, reputation, and the number of match days covered.He said that junior or fresher commentators typically earn between Rs 35,000 and Rs 40,000 per day, often working around 100 days a year — though reaching that number can be challenging given the competition and scheduling.That translates to roughly Rs 2–2.5 lakh per month, assuming consistent assignments throughout the year. However, Chopra added that the figures can skyrocket for seasoned names who have established themselves as broadcasting brands.“For senior or top commentators, the pay can go up to Rs 6–10 lakh per day,” Chopra revealed, indicating the stark contrast between newcomers and veterans.When Raj Shamani calculated the yearly estimate, he pointed out that a top-tier commentator working around 100 days could make Rs 10–12 crore annually — a figure Chopra agreed was realistic.These earnings depend on the tournaments covered, such as the Indian Premier League (IPL), bilateral series, and ICC events, where commentary contracts are among the most lucrative in the sports media industry.Aakash Chopra, who has worked with multiple broadcasters, highlighted how commentary has evolved into a serious and competitive profession, combining expertise, presentation, and entertainment value.From explaining on-field tactics to engaging millions of fans, modern cricket commentators have become as recognisable as the players themselves — and, as this discussion revealed, the financial rewards for the best in the business can be truly staggering.","Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra gave fans a rare peek into the economics of sports broadcasting.

England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt scored her fifth Women's World Cup century while Sophie Ecclestone delivered an outstanding bowling performance, leading England to an 89-run win over Sri Lanka on Saturday.Sciver-Brunt's impressive 117 runs from 117 balls, including nine fours and two sixes, helped England reach 253/9. Ecclestone then secured 4/17 as Sri Lanka was dismissed for 164 runs in 45.4 overs.England now leads the eight-team standings with six points after winning all three matches, moving ahead of defending champions Australia who have five points.Sciver-Brunt, who was dropped early at three runs by Udeshika Prabodhani, made the most of her chance to score her tenth ODI century and a record fifth in Women's World Cups.Sri Lanka's chase faced an early setback when captain Chamari Athapaththu retired hurt with seven runs in the sixth over due to cramps and had to leave the field on a stretcher.Hasini Perera and Harshitha Samarawickrama formed a promising 58-run partnership, reaching 95/1 before Ecclestone initiated a collapse.Ecclestone's exceptional spin bowling caused Sri Lanka to lose three wickets for just eight runs in four overs.Ecclestone dismissed Perera, who was caught by Alice Capsey, followed by Samarawickrama's wicket with Lauren Bell taking the catch.She then bowled out Dilhari for four runs, leaving Sri Lanka at 103/4 at the halfway mark.Athapaththu returned to bat but quickly became Ecclestone's fourth victim, bowled through the gate by a sharply turning delivery.Sciver-Brunt contributed with the ball as well, taking 2/25 in five overs, while Charlie Dean secured 2/47 in nine overs.Sri Lanka's left-arm spinner Inoka Ranaweera, who had previously taken four wickets against India, maintained her form with 3/33, including a crucial double-wicket maiden over.Off-spinner Kavisha Dilhari supported well with 1/34 from eight overs, but Sciver-Brunt remained steady despite the regular fall of wickets.England's innings concluded with Sciver-Brunt's dismissal on the second-to-last ball, after she helped add 49 runs in the final five overs.England's innings started poorly, losing two early wickets before Sciver-Brunt and Heather Knight stabilized with a 60-run partnership from 74 balls.Knight's innings ended at 29 runs from 47 balls after a late review confirmed a glove touch on a reverse sweep attempt.Inoka's impressive 35th over saw her dismiss both Emma Lamb and Alice Capsey, with Lamb bowled behind her legs and Capsey stumped by wicketkeeper Anushka Sanjeewani.Sophia Dunkley scored 18 runs from 30 balls before being caught and bowled by Dilhari, as England lost three wickets for 34 runs between overs 30 and 40.The scoring rate dropped below four runs per over until Charlie Dean hit a reverse sweep to end a seven-over period without boundaries.","England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt scored her fifth Women's World Cup century.

Brief score:

During their first-ever international encounter, Namibia secured a remarkable victory over South Africa in a historic Twenty20 international match on Saturday, thanks to wicketkeeper Zane Green 's explosive late-game performance. Green remained unbeaten at 30 runs, contributing 23 runs in the final two overs of this first-ever international clash between the neighbouring African nations.Green's decisive performance included a powerful hook shot for six runs off Andile Simelane's first delivery in the final over, with 11 runs needed. He sealed the victory by hitting the last ball to the midwicket boundary.The match celebrated the inauguration of the Namibia Cricket Ground, which will serve as one of the venues for the 2027 Cricket World Cup, jointly hosted by South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Namibia.""You can see what it means, for the team and the crowd,"" said Namibian captain Gerhard Erasmus after leading his players on a victory lap in front of a capacity crowd. ""The guys did it with good skill.""South Africa fielded a weakened team, as several key players, including regular captain Aiden Markram , were in Pakistan for an upcoming Test series in Lahore. Despite all players having international experience, they struggled against Namibia, who had recently qualified for next year's T20 World Cup in India.""We weren't good enough,"" admitted stand-in South African captain Donovan Ferreira.He noted that their defense was hampered by fast bowler Gerald Coetzee's chest muscle injury, forcing him to leave after bowling just nine balls.The South African innings got off to a poor start when Quinton de Kock , making his first international appearance since the 2024 T20 World Cup, was dismissed for a single run in the opening over. The team struggled to gain momentum on the slow pitch, managing only 134 runs for eight wickets after choosing to bat first.Ruben Trumpelmann, who began his cricket career in South Africa, claimed three wickets for 28 runs. Newcomer Max Heingo took two quick wickets, reducing South Africa to 65 for five in the eleventh over.The final scorecard showed South Africa at 134-8 in their allotted 20 overs, with J.

Ravindra Jadeja on India’s dominant win: 'Clarity in my role helps me pace my innings'

NEW DELHI: Ravindra Jadeja , who serves as India's vice-captain in the ongoing Test series against West Indies, discussed his exclusion from the ODI squad for the upcoming Australia tour.He mentioned that the team management had communicated with him about the decision. Despite his omission, Jadeja remains committed to performing whenever given a chance. His recent performance included taking three wickets on day two of the second Test in New Delhi, helping restrict West Indies to 140/4 at stumps.The experienced left-arm spin bowling all-rounder has an impressive record in ODIs, with 231 wickets and 2,806 runs in 204 matches.""I don't have it in my hands. I want to play, but at the end of the day, the team management, selectors, coach, and captain have their own thoughts,"" Jadeja told reporters.""Why didn't I get selected for this series? There must be a reason behind it, and they talked to me. It's not like they surprised me when I found out that I wasn't selected. It's a good thing that the captain, selector, and coach talked to me about the reasons behind it.""After winning the T20 World Cup in 2024 and concluding his T20I career, Jadeja maintains his desire to represent India in major tournaments. This comes after India's runner-up finish to Australia in the 2023 ODI World Cup.""I am happy whenever I get a chance, as I will try to do what I have been doing for so many years. If I get a chance to play in a major tournament like the World Cup, then it will be a good thing for Indian cricket. Everyone's dream is to win the World Cup. Last time, we missed out on it by a whisker. If we can win this time, then we will fulfill our dreams.""When asked about personal milestones, Jadeja emphasized the importance of team success over individual achievements.""I don't lie – sometimes I think about it and I feel good for a while. But when it happens, I feel the same and don't feel anything is new,"" he added.""More than my personal milestone, I think about the team's performance – like is the team winning? Is it an impactful performance from me? My mindset is like this. If I run or take wickets, does it impact the winning of the team or not? That is more important.""If you make runs or pick wickets and the team loses, it doesn't matter. When you do an impactful performance and the team wins, especially in ICC tournaments, WTC and if we win the finals by doing well as a team, and my performance is good, then I feel satisfied.""Jadeja was appointed vice-captain for the West Indies series while Rishabh Pant recovers from a fractured right foot. As a senior team member, he expressed his willingness to guide younger players and adapt to different situations.""If there is a wicket for batting, then I become a batsman. If there is a wicket for bowling, then I become a bowler – it's simple. I don't think about captains and captaincy – that time has gone way too early now,"" stated the all-rounder.""Now, as much as possible, what the team needs, I do as per that. Whether it is in batting, like Jaiswal comes and talks to me, or Kuldeep comes and asks about bowling, I tell them what can be possible and give my opinion to them on anything they ask.

Other World Cup qualifiers results from Europe:

Erling Haaland continued his sensational form for Norway, scoring a hat-trick to surpass 50 international goals in record time as his team thrashed Israel 5-0 in Oslo on Saturday. The win edges Norway closer to their first World Cup finals since 1998.The match unfolded against the backdrop of political unrest, with hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators chanting “Free Palestine” to protest Israel’s actions in Gaza. Norwegian police used tear gas to disperse the crowd and made several arrests. Inside Ullevaal Stadium, a small group of Israeli fans waved flags and held a banner reading “Let the Ball Talk!”Norway now top Group I with 18 points, six ahead of second-placed Italy, who defeated Estonia 3-1 in Tallinn. The result leaves the Norwegians firmly in control as they aim for qualification for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Israel, meanwhile, will face Italy in Udine on Tuesday, needing a win to stay in contention.Haaland became the fastest player in men’s international football to reach 50 goals, now boasting 51 in just 46 games. His first penalty was saved by Israel goalkeeper Daniel Peretz, and even a retake was denied, but Norway surged ahead through an 18th-minute own goal by Anan Khalaili.Haaland added his first goal soon after, with Israel contributing another own goal through Idan Nachmias. He then completed the hat-trick with a header and a final nod-in, marking his sixth career international hat-trick. Cristiano Ronaldo had a penalty saved as Portugal narrowly beat the Republic of Ireland 1-0, with Ruben Neves scoring in injury time while honoring his late teammate Diogo Jota. Spain maintained a perfect qualifying record, defeating Georgia 2-0, while Turkey crushed Bulgaria 6-1. Albania claimed a historic 1-0 win at Serbia, keeping their World Cup hopes alive behind England in Group K.With the group stages heating up, Norway and Haaland appear unstoppable, but tense matchups, protests, and dramatic finishes across Europe ensure that the road to the 2026 World Cup will be anything but predictable.","Erling Haaland scores a hat-trick as Norway thrash Israel 5-0 in Oslo.

India are without a win at the halfway stage of the AFC Asian Cup 2027 final round qualifiers, but miraculously, they are not out of the race either.Reduced to ten men early in the second half after Sandesh Jhingan was sent off just after resumption, Khalid Jamil’s side was a minute away from a second consecutive loss, and almost out of contention. Singapore, however, blundered in the final minute of regulation time as Rahim Ali’s first international goal helped secure a 1-1 result in Singapore on Thursday.Singapore are still on top of the group with five points, three more than India’s two, but they will have a chance to make amends in the home clash next week. Hong Kong (four) and Bangladesh (one) have a game in hand.Only the group winners qualify for the Saudi Arabia edition.“I think it’s going to be difficult, we are just taking one game at a time,” Sunil Chhetri , who returned to the team after being left out for last month’s CAFA Nations Cup, said after the draw. “Going ten men and getting a result wasn’t easy. Just glad to be taking a point away.”Given the circumstances, India will be delighted with a point. When Ikhsan Fandi scored in first half stoppage time for Singapore and Jhingan was sent off for a second yellow, India were left with their backs against the wall.Chances were limited, and the hosts were in the ascendancy, only to blunder right at the end. Without a shot on goal till then and ineffective upfront, India could have only scored from a defensive lapse.India were thrown a lifeline in the 90th minute when Jordan Emaviwe casually played a ball back to goalkeeper Izwan Mahbud. Rahim pressed and the keeper’s clearance struck the feet of the India striker, who was left with an open goal to score his first international goal.For most part, Singapore were the better team, enjoying 63 % ball possession and plenty of looks at the India goal. The hosts had several chances, only to miss, twice from handshaking distance. Ilhan Fandi had two good chances in quick succession.At first, he shot wide, after being put under pressure by a sliding Rahul Bheke, while another attempt from a one-on-one situation with Gurpreet Singh Sandhu saw the keeper effect a good save.Even in the first half with everyone available, India never really posed a threat to the rival goal. Jamil chose to start with two men upfront – Chhetri, Farukh Choudhary – but without creativity in midfield, chances were in short supply.Then, with time running out, Jamil was forced into attacking changes: Udanta Singh, Sahal Abdul Samad and Rahim were all thrown into the mix, and India were ‘rewarded’ with a lucky goal to bring home a point.","Singapore draw 1-1 with India in AFC Asian Cup 2027 qualifier.

Algeria secured their place in the 2026 FIFA World Cup on Thursday with a commanding 3-0 victory over Somalia, becoming the fourth African team to qualify after Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt. The match, played in Oran, saw Wolfsburg striker Mohamed Amoura score twice, while Riyad Mahrez contributed both as scorer and provider.Amoura opened the scoring in just the sixth minute, volleying a precise Mahrez cross into the net. The former Manchester City winger then converted a loose ball in the first half to double the lead. Mahrez once again set up Amoura in the 57th minute, stretching Algeria’s advantage to 3-0. With qualification secured, coach Vladimir Petkovic substituted both scorers to manage the squad ahead of the final round of Group G fixtures.Algeria sit atop Group G with 22 points, four ahead of second-placed Uganda, and will make their fifth World Cup appearance in the United States, Canada, and Mexico next year. Their previous campaigns include first-round exits in 1982, 1986, and 2010, while they reached the second round in 2014 before losing 2-1 to eventual champions Germany.Notably, goalkeeper Luca Zidane, son of French legend Zinedine Zidane, made the squad after switching allegiance from France to Algeria.Elsewhere on the continent, Kenya defeated Burundi 1-0 in a fiery East African derby, with Ryan Ogam scoring the decisive goal. Burundi played almost the entire match with 10 men following a straight red card for Bonfils-Caleb Bimenyimana.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins. He was pushed from second place to third, with Cassidy in second. Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings. He won two podium spots this season.","All three Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

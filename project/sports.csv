Poll What do you think about KL Rahul's current role as India's finisher? He's the perfect finisher He should bat higher in the order He needs to improve

NEW DELHI: KL Rahul 's transformation into India's most reliable ODI finisher has triggered a wave of praise, but none louder than South African pace legend Dale Steyn , who believes the wicketkeeper-batter is masking even bigger batting potential. With back-to-back unbeaten fifties in the ongoing three-match series against South Africa, Rahul has not only stabilised India lower down the order but also impressed Steyn to the point where the former pacer called him a “hundred machine forced to finish. ”Rahul, who now predominantly bats at No. 5 or 6, struck 60 in Ranchi and followed it with a blistering 66 off 43 balls in Raipur. Even though India lost the second ODI after South Africa pulled off a record chase, Steyn couldn't ignore the impact Rahul had on the innings. Speaking on Star Sports, he highlighted how Rahul has mastered the art of acceleration at the death despite fewer balls to face.“A good, handy knock set by the skipper, KL, and he led his team well in the first one. In the second game too, he knew exactly when to go slow and when to explode,” Steyn observed, pointing to Rahul's game awareness in a tense middle-overs phase alongside Ravindra Jadeja.Steyn then made a striking claim — Rahul, usually denied top-order opportunities, could have posted many more centuries if he batted higher.“He just knows how to do it. If he batted 3 or opened, I'm pretty certain he would go on to get hundreds. But those positions are for other players, and he knows what his role is within this team,” Steyn said, calling Rahul's adaptability a priceless advantage for India.Despite Rahul's heroics, India's 358/5 — powered by centuries from Virat Kohli and Ruturaj Gaikwad — wasn't enough to prevent South Africa's spectacular four-wicket win, driven by Aiden Markram 's 110. With the series now level at 1-1, the Visakhapatnam decider on December 6 sets the stage not just for a title clash, but for another Rahul masterclass.",KL Rahul has scored back-to-back unbeaten fifties in ODI series against South Africa.

Veteran Australian off-spinner Nathan Lyon said he was ""absolutely filthy"" after learning he had been left out of the second Test of the Ashes series against England in Brisbane on Thursday. Lyon also explained whether he had spoken with the Australian team management after the decision.Australia opted for an all-pace attack for the Brisbane Test, leaving out Lyon. The team made two changes from the eight-wicket win in the opening Test in Perth. Michael Neser came in for Lyon, and Josh Inglis replaced injured opener Usman Khawaja.Lyon said he got to know about his omission only after reaching the ground on the morning of the match.""I found out as I came to ground, as I always do, pretty early, about 12 o'clock, and found out about 12.30,"" Nathan Lyon said to 7Cricket.George Bailey , the chair of Australia's National Selection Panel, said the pace of recent Test matches had limited Lyon’s chance to influence games on seam-friendly surfaces.Reacting to that, Lyon said he has not had a detailed conversation with the team management yet and is taking time to process the decision.""No, yeah, absolutely filthy, but, yeah, can't do anything about it. So, yeah, just hope I can play my role in making sure I can get the guys ready and do whatever I can to make sure that we get the right result here,"" Lyon said.""To be honest, I haven't really sat down with Ronnie [Andrew McDonald] or George yet. I'm letting things settle down in my own head, and trying to make sure that, as I said, doing whatever I can to make sure the guys out in the middle there, representing Australia, do the right thing and get the right result for us,"" Lyon added.""The communication is always there, I just hadn't had it in me to sit down with the coach and George at the moment,"" Lyon furher said, adding, ""So that will happen. I'm not the first player to miss a Test match and I won't be the last. But, yeah, obviously pretty gutted because I know the role that I can play within Australian cricket and especially a venue like this.""In the first day of the match, Joe Root scored his first Test century in Australia and his 40th overall, taking England past 300 runs in their first innings.","Nathan Lyon says he is ""absolutely filthy"" after learning he was left out of the second Test of the Ashes series against England in Brisbane.

WPL Auction 2026: Full Breakdown of Every Major Number

NEW DELHI: MS Dhoni 's impact at Chennai Super Kings has long been hailed for its calmness, loyalty and unmatched leadership — but former CSK star Mike Hussey has now lifted the curtain on a lesser-known side of the franchise: the off-field bonding culture built around Dhoni's open-door hospitality.In a fascinating revelation on The Overlap Cricket podcast, Hussey said Dhoni's room effectively became CSK's unofficial team lounge during every IPL season. Players drifted in and out at all hours, discussing cricket, bantering, sharing meals — and for some, unwinding with shisha.“Dhoni is just the most amazing guy. His room is available open 24 hours a day. Anyone can go up there and just sit. He has got his lounge room, players just sit around, they start talking cricket, some of them like the shisha, you know, the flavoured tobacco stuff. That is their way of socialising. Credit to Dhoni, he opens his room up — lots of players go up, they bring food up, it is fantastic,” Hussey said, offering a glimpse into the camaraderie that defined CSK's IPL dynasty.The anecdote echoes former CSK batter George Bailey 's earlier revelation that Dhoni often hosted relaxed hookah sessions to help younger players settle into the team.Bailey had said Dhoni's informal approach broke down hierarchy and helped create a sense of belonging — a trademark CSK value over the years.Hussey also shared a surprising detail about Dhoni's preparation habits: despite being one of the game's greatest wicketkeepers, he almost never practised the skill in training.“I think the only time I've seen him catch a ball was when we wanted to knock in a new pair of gloves. I've never seen him practise his keeping ever. But he bats a long, long time — he hits thousands and thousands of balls,” Hussey revealed.With Dhoni set to return for IPL 2026 after being retained by the five-time champions, stories like these underline why CSK players past and present continue to call the franchise a “family” — one built on trust, comfort and a legend whose door was literally always open.",Mike Hussey reveals MS Dhoni's open-door hospitality at Chennai Super Kings.

Still have doubts? Virat Kohli blows World Cup trumpet with another masterclass

Poll Who do you think is primarily responsible for India's decline in Test cricket? Players Team Management Both equally External Factors

NEW DELHi: Former head coach Ravi Shastri has delivered one of his most pointed critiques yet of India's dramatic fall in Test cricket, declaring that both players and the team management must take responsibility for the decline. The former India head coach, who oversaw the team's successful run alongside Virat Kohli, said he is deeply hurt by the sight of a side that once dominated home and away now suffering whitewashes against New Zealand and South Africa at home.Shastri, speaking to Prabhat Khabar in a podcast teaser, was visibly frustrated while recalling India's collapse in the Guwahati Test. “You tell me. What happened in Guwahati – from 100/1, you skip to 130/7? This team is not that bad either. They have this much talent at least. The players should take some responsibility too. You have played spin since you started playing cricket,” he said.Asked whether he was defending new head coach Gautam Gambhir , Shastri was blunt. “I'm not protecting [him]. One hundred per cent he is responsible too. When am I saying anything otherwise?” he said.Then came his most striking comment. “Agar yeh mere saath hota, main pehla responsibility leta (Had this happened with me, I would have been the first one to take responsibility). But then, I wouldn't have spared the players either in the team meeting.”The frustration stems from high standards Shastri's own tenure had set. Between 2017 and 2021, India became the world's best travelling Test side, winning two historic series in Australia, staying No. 1 for 42 months and losing only two matches at home under Kohli.While Rahul Dravid revived the team after a slow start, leading India to home series wins and a second WTC final, that trajectory has stalled under Gambhir. India have managed just two Test series victories in 14 months — against Bangladesh and West Indies — while suffering heavy defeats in Australia and a draw in England.",Ravi Shastri says both players and team management must take responsibility for India's dramatic fall in Test cricket.

Harbhajan Singh interview: Lauds growth of ILT20, picks strongest team and more

RAIPUR: South African cricket's transformation from the listless side that was hammered 3-0 during their last Test tour of India in Oct 2019 to the powerhouse they have become today has been remarkable.Their men’s team reached the 2023 ODI World Cup semi finals and the 2024 T20 World Cup final while the women’s side made the finals of the 2023 and 2024 T20 World Cups, as well as the 2025 ODI World Cup.This tour of India has carried forward that resurgence. After clinching their first Test series win in India in 25 years — a 2-0 sweep — the Proteas now have a chance to complete a rare double on the hosts by winning the three-match ODI series if they take the decider in Vizag on Saturday.On Wednesday in the second ODI, South Africa, riding on experienced opener Aiden Markram ’s sublime 98-ball 110, chased down a daunting target of 359 to script a magnificent four-wicket win and level the series 1-1.Speaking to the media, Markram admitted he was “hiding at the back of the change room” when Cor bin Bosch and Keshav Maha raj sealed the thrilling win in the final over.“It feels like everything’s going along smoothly, and then all of a sudden the game might change.At the death, the run-rate can go up really quickly. I was biting my nails and trying not to engage with anyone,” he said.He also revealed he had praised injured pacer Nandre Burger — the next man in — for staying composed under enormous pressure. “I was impressed with how calm he was, because I would never have been that way,” he said.Markram said such victories infuse the side with belief. “All of it feels very far away still, but belief and confidence are probably the two things you take as a group. To chase quite a big number gives the group belief and confidence that the next time you’re in that position, we can say, ‘We’ve done it before, and we can do it again,’” he said.Markram had managed only seven runs in the first ODI in Ranchi, but stressed that personal milestones mattered little without a team win.“Runs only matter if you win games, at least for me. If we’d lost today, I’d be as miserable as I was after the previous game. Getting the result is what makes me really happy.”While Markram and captain Temba Bavuma (46) laid the foundation for the chase, it was the explosive 92-run stand in just 64 balls between South Africa’s young batting sensations Dewald Brevis (54 off 34) and Matthew Breetzke (68) that swung the match decisively.Breetzke is enjoying a sensational start to his ODI career, with six fifties and a hundred in his first 11 innings.Markram was full of praise for the duo. “Brevis hits the ball for miles. He takes the game head-on. He’s not afraid to put bowlers under pressure, and as cricket lovers, it’s great to watch. It’s really entertaining.”Breetzke has had an incredible start to his ODI career. He managed the situation really well today. I think he’s only played 10, 11 or 12 games, but the way he batted today felt like he had at least 50 caps.”He added that Breetzke’s ability to both attack and control a chase is invaluable.“It’s a big plus for us to have the side of Matthew Breetzke that can really take the game on and also the side that can manage the chase nicely.”With Brevis, Marco Jansen, Corbin Bosch and others, South Africa possess significant lower-order firepower.“We’ve got some great hitters and great batters in the middle to lower order. If you give them a chance, they can do damage,” Markram said.",South Africa beat India by four wickets in second ODI to level series 1-1.

NEW DELHI: England opener Zak Crawley lauded a “flawless” Joe Root after the 34-year-old finally ended his long wait for an Ashes century in Australia on the opening day of the second Test in Brisbane on Thursday. Root entered the series with 39 Test hundreds but had never reached triple figures on Australian soil across three previous tours.His struggles continued in the opening Test in Perth, prompting some critics to question whether the Yorkshireman could truly be considered among cricket’s modern greats without an Ashes hundred in Australia.Root responded emphatically with a superb unbeaten 135, guiding England to 325/9 at stumps.Crawley, who put on a 117-run stand with Root, revealed that the England dressing room felt the nerves far more than Root as he approached the milestone.""We were nervous for him for a long while before that,"" Crawley said.""You know I think he was less nervous than us. We were just talking about it for ages before he even got there.""And then obviously when he got there we were, we were chuffed for him and so was everyone at the ground.""Crawley added that Root barely acknowledged the significance of the achievement, even though the wait had become a lingering narrative.""He's like his usual self, he's so humble,"" said Crawley, who scored 76 to put his own Perth disappointment behind him after consecutive ducks.""He's not trying to make too much of a deal of it, but I'm sure inside he's pretty, pretty delighted.""He just played a flawless knock.

NEW DELHI: Australian pace great Mitchell Starc , who overtook Pakistan legend Wasim Akram to become the highest wicket-taking left-arm fast bowler in Test cricket, says Akram remains unmatched in his eyes.For Starc, the milestone — achieved during another commanding pink-ball performance — carries humility.""Wasim is still the pinnacle and better,"" Starc said when asked about surpassing the Pakistani great.Starc’s figures of 6/71 marked his sixth five-wicket haul in day-night Tests, the most by any bowler, and extended his exceptional dominance with the pink ball. He now has 87 wickets in pink-ball Tests — far ahead of the next best, teammates Nathan Lyon and Pat Cummins, who have 43 each.By the end of play, Starc had moved to 418 Test wickets in 102 matches at an average of 26.42, with best figures of 7/58. His tally includes 18 five-wicket hauls and three 10-wicket match hauls, making him the fourth-highest wicket-taker for Australia in Test history.Reflecting on his record-breaking day, Starc admitted even he can’t fully explain his remarkable success with the pink ball.""I get asked all the time, I still don't know. It is what it is.I think it is still like a white ball. Today, it was a soft ball. A couple of Yorkshiremen, runs and wickets. Joe (Root) batted well there. A pretty tough day's cricket,"" he said.""I think once that ball goes soft, it is not the easiest thing to score with. It is certainly not the easiest thing to bowl with when it is soft. Pink ball, 9 for 320, pretty solid day's Test cricket,"" he said.His achievement drew warm praise from Wasim Akram himself, who congratulated Starc with a message on X.""Super Starc! Proud of you, mate. Your incredible hard work sets you apart, and it was only a matter of time before you crossed my tally of wickets. I am pleased to give this to you! Go well, and keep soaring to new heights in your stellar career,"" Akram wrote.Earlier in the day, England won the toss and chose to bat. Starc struck early, removing Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope for ducks to leave England reeling at 5/2. Joe Root then rebuilt the innings with a 117-run partnership alongside Zak Crawley, who scored 76 off 93 balls with 11 boundaries. Root later added another crucial stand with Harry Brook, who made 31 off 33 balls.Australia regained momentum through a sharp run-out from Josh Inglis that dismissed England captain Ben Stokes for 19 and triggered a middle-order slide. Starc completed his five-wicket haul as England slumped to 264/9, before late acceleration from Root and Jofra Archer — who smashed an unbeaten 32 off 26 balls with a four and two sixes — lifted the visitors to 325/9 at stumps on day one.","Mitchell Starc overtakes Wasim Akram to become highest wicket-taking left-arm fast bowler in Test cricket.

Selection shock

NEW DELHI: Joe Root finally registered his maiden Test century in Australia on his fourth Ashes tour, steering England from a perilous 5/2 to 325/9 at stumps after a gripping opening day of the second Test in Brisbane on Thursday. Mitchell Starc claimed 6/71 — a spell that made him the most successful left-arm fast bowler in Test cricket — but Root dominated the day-night encounter with a sublime unbeaten 135.No. 11 Jofra Archer added late fireworks, blasting a career-best 32* off 26 balls, including two sixes, to delight England’s travelling supporters. His unbeaten 61-run stand with Root was England’s highest 10th-wicket partnership at the Gabba.Root, the world’s top-ranked batter and second on the all-time Test runs list behind Sachin Tendulkar, had never reached three figures in Australia despite three previous Ashes tours. On Thursday, he buried that narrative. Walking in during the third over with Starc swinging the pink ball under lights, he produced a near-flawless innings and reached his century with a gentle leg glance off Scott Boland.Starc’s six wickets pushed his tally to 418, overtaking Wasim Akram’s 414.“Wasim’s still the pinnacle. I think he’s still better than me,” Starc said after achieving the milestone.The left-armer struck immediately, removing Ben Duckett in his first over and Ollie Pope in his second to leave England reeling.But unlike their collapse in Perth, England fought back through a crucial 117-run stand between Root and Zak Crawley, who made a composed 76.Both sides wore black armbands in tribute to former England batter Robin Smith, who passed away this week.Australia, already without injured captain Pat Cummins, surprised many by omitting off-spinner Nathan Lyon and bringing in seamer Michael Neser — the first time in nearly 14 years they fielded a home Test XI without a frontline spinner.After the early collapse, Root stitched together vital stands with Harry Brook (31), Ben Stokes (19) and Will Jacks (19), adopting a more controlled approach than England’s first-Test aggression.Starc remained the primary threat, while Scott Boland produced the ball of the day — a stunning delivery that cut back sharply to bowl Jamie Smith for a duck.England slumped from 210/4 to 211/6, then to 264/9 as Starc ran through the lower order under the lights. But just as a quick finish seemed imminent, Root shifted gears and Archer counterattacked.Archer launched two towering sixes, while Root produced one of the shots of the day — a bold reverse ramp for six over third man off Boland — to ensure England ended firmly on the front foot.",Joe Root scores maiden Test century in Australia on his fourth Ashes tour.

Big relief for Mathew Hayden





Joe Root’s long wait for a Test century in Australia ended on Thursday, and the landmark brought unexpected relief for former Australian opener Matthew Hayden, who had publicly made a bold promise if Root failed to score a century in Australia on the tour.Hayden, who had wagered that he would "" walk nude around the MCG "" if Root failed to score a hundred this Ashes summer, congratulated the England batter soon after the milestone, calling it a moment he had been “literally” invested in.""Congratulations, mate, on a hundred in Australia. Took you a while, and there was no one that had more skin in the game than me, literally,"" Hayden said in a video posted by England Cricket on X.After 16 matches, 30 innings, and four tours spread across over a decade, Joe Root finally had his moment in Australia. The England batter reached his maiden century on Australian soil on Thursday at the Gabba in Brisbane, in the second Test of the ongoing Ashes series, bringing an end to a long wait.Root reached the milestone in 181 balls, batting through a phase when England needed stability and control, and in the process, checked off one of the few achievements missing from his record.His earlier highest Test score on Australian soil was 89.With the century on Thursday, Joe Root has now scored 40 hundreds in his Test career. Root is now only one behind former Australian captain Ricky Ponting, who has 41 Test hundreds.Overall, Root is at number four in terms of number of centuries in Tests, behind only Sachin Tendulkar (51), Jacques Kallis (45), and Ricky Ponting (41).At the end of day one's play at Gabba, England were 325/9 with Joe Root (135), and Jofra Archer (32) at the crease.Australia, who won the opening Test inside two days in Perth, went into this match without regular skipper Pat Cummins.He had been rumoured to be making an early return from a back injury, but instead the hosts sprung a major surprise by leaving out off-spinner Nathan Lyon for seamer Michael Neser.It was the first time in almost 14 years that Australia played a Test at home without a frontline spinner.Former Australian opener Matthew Hayden had expressed confidence that ace England batter Joe Root would break his century drought Down Under during the Ashes series.Hayden had said that he was willing to walk around the Melbourne Cricket Ground completely naked if Root failed to make a century on the tour.Speaking on the 'All Over Bar the Cricket' podcast on YouTube, Hayden gave himself a massive dare if Root failed to score a century in Australia during the series, saying, ""I will walk nude around the MCG if he doesn't make a hundred this summer.""Former India off-spinner took a cheeky jibe at Hayden after the ton. ""Haydos should be getting suited up,"" Ashwin posted on X after Root's ton.

After 16 matches, 30 innings, and four tours spread across over a decade, Joe Root finally had his moment in Australia. The England batter reached his maiden century on Australian soil on Thursday at the Gabba in Brisbane, in the second Test of the ongoing Ashes series, bringing an end to a long wait. Root reached the milestone in 181 balls, batting through a phase when England needed stability and control, and in the process, checked off one of the few achievements missing from his record.His earlier highest Test score on Australian soil was 89.With the century on Thursday, Joe Root has now scored 40 hundreds in his Test career. Root is now only one behind former Australian captain Ricky Ponting, who has 41 Test hundreds.Overall, Root is at number four in terms of number of centuries in Tests, behind only Sachin Tendulkar (51), Jacques Kallis (45), and Ricky Ponting (41).Australia, who won the opening Test inside two days in Perth, went into this match without regular skipper Pat Cummins.He had been rumoured to be making an early return from a back injury, but instead the hosts sprung a major surprise by leaving out off-spinner Nathan Lyon for seamer Michael Neser.It was the first time in almost 14 years that Australia played a Test at home without a frontline spinner.","Joe Root scored his first Test century on Australian soil on Thursday.

India premier white-ball all-rounder Hardik Pandya is done with his domestic warm-up and is all set to join the Indian cricket team in Cuttack on December 6, the day entire squad will assemble for the five-T20I series vs South Africa. After getting clearance from BCCI CoE, Pandya featured in two Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy games for Baroda vs Punjab on December 2 and Gujarat on December 4.As TimesofIndia.com had earlier reported, he was scheduled to play the third game - December 6 fixture vs Haryana - but there has been a later alteration to that plan and he will be linking up with Suryakumar Yadav-led squad on the same day. Some players are expected to land in Cuttack a day before - on December 5 - the official joining date and Pandya could well be one of them. The final travel arrangements are yet to be done.After staying away from cricket due to his quadricep injury, Pandya had decent outings in the two fixtures with both bat and ball. The first game was an ordinary outing with the ball as he picked just one wicket and leaked 52 runs in four overs vs Punjab but was on fire with the bat. The right-hander smashed 77 off 42 balls, including four sixes, to help his side chase down 223 with five deliveries to spare.In his final SMAT appearance vs Gujarat, he was precise with the ball during his spell of 1/16. As far as batting was concerned, there wasn't much to be done in the 74-run chase and he could contribute only 10 off six balls in the modest chase.India squad for T20I series against SA: Suryakumar Yadav (C), Shubman Gill (VC)*, Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jitesh Sharma (WK), Sanju Samson (WK), Jasprit Bumrah, Varun Chakaravarthy, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Washington SundarNote: * Subject to fitness clearance from BCCI COE.",Hardik Pandya played two matches for Baroda in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.

South Africa's Aiden Markram led his team to a series-leveling victory against India in the second ODI on Wednesday with a stellar 110-run performance, helping chase down a target of 359 with four balls remaining. The win came after Markram felt responsible for the team's loss in the first ODI at Ranchi, where India won by 17 runs.Markram's century was complemented by Dewald Brevis's quick 54 runs off 34 balls and Matthew Breetzke 's steady 68, enabling South Africa to secure a four-wicket win in the second match.""Runs only matter if you win games, to be fair, or at least for me. If we'd lost today, I'd be as miserable as I would have been in the previous game. Getting the result is something that makes me really happy,"" Markram said after the match.He acknowledged his role in the first game's loss, particularly when the team lost early wickets.""Being three down early in the first game, a lot of that is the difference in the results I feel. From a personal point of view I felt quite responsible for that,"" he stated.The chase in the second ODI reminded Markram of the first game, though with a different outcome this time.""There wasn't much to be honest. You kind of know how to chase 350 or 360, you have to take the game on a bit and manage that with setting the game up and being smart in between as well,"" Markram explained about the mid-innings discussions.He emphasized the importance of individual decision-making during the chase.""It wasn't a collective discussion, it was each guy backing their game and the options that they feel confident in doing and trusting that and hopefully it comes off,"" he added.The victory sets up an exciting decider in Visakhapatnam on Saturday, with South Africa eyeing a series win in India.""All of it feels like it's very far away still, but belief and confidence are probably the two things that you can take as a group,"" Markram reflected on the team's prospects.He further elaborated on the team's growing confidence.""To chase quite a big number gives the group belief and confidence that the next time you're in that position, we've done it before and we can do it again,"" he said.Markram praised the performances of young batters Brevis and Breetzke.""Brevis hits the ball miles. He takes the game on. He's not afraid to put bowlers under pressure and as cricket lovers, I suppose it's great to watch. It's really entertaining,"" he commented.He particularly highlighted Breetzke's maturity at the crease.""Matthew Breetzke has had an incredible start to his ODI career. He managed the situation really well today. I think, he's only played 10, 11 or 12 games. But the way he batted today was like this guy's got at least 50 caps under his belt,"" Markram observed.He concluded by noting Breetzke's versatility as a player.""A big plus for us to have the side of Matthew Breetzke that can really take the game on and then the side of Matthew Breetzke that can also manage the chase quite nicely,"" he said.",South Africa beat India by four wickets in the second ODI at Ranchi.

NEW DELHI: Organisers shifted the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy match between Baroda and Gujarat to the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Thursday after large crowds gathered to watch Hardik Pandya , raising security concerns at the Gymkhana ground.Baroda won the match by eight wickets. The decision to shift the venue was taken because of unexpected crowd numbers and security concerns around Hardik’s presence.This was Hardik’s second competitive match after returning from a two-month injury break. He was injured during India’s Asia Cup Super Fours match against Sri Lanka and had been out since. He missed both the ODI and T20I series against Australia and was not available for the ongoing 50-over series against South Africa.Hardik will next play for India in the five-match T20I series against South Africa starting December 9 in Cuttack.The venue change became necessary after unusually large crowds gathered near the team hotel, training areas, and ticket counters, news agency PTI reported, quoting officials. They said the numbers were much higher than what domestic matches usually attract.""Fan turnout, enquiries, and crowd movement exceeded our projections by a huge margin.To ensure safety and smooth match operations, we decided to shift the match to Rajiv Gandhi Stadium,"" a senior organising official was quoted as saying by PTI.After scoring an unbeaten 77 against Punjab on Tuesday, Hardik bowled four overs for Baroda against Gujarat, finishing with 1 for 16, including a maiden.

NEW DELHI: Punjab FC lost 3-1 to East Bengal in the first semifinal of the AIFF Super Cup at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Fatorda, Goa, on Thursday.With this win, East Bengal entered their third AIFF Super Cup final. It is also their second final of the season after losing the IFA Shield to Mohun Bagan SG.East Bengal went ahead in the 12th minute when Mohamad Bashim Rashid scored. Punjab FC equalised in the 34th minute through a Daniel Ramirez penalty.Kevin Sibille restored East Bengal’s lead in first-half stoppage time (45+3), and captain Saul Crespo scored in the 71st minute to secure the result for Oscar Bruzon’s team.Both sides began the match slowly, trying to settle into the game. Punjab had the first clear chance when Pramveer met a cross in the tenth minute, but his header went wide.Punjab were without suspended defender Muhammed Uvais, and the team seemed unsettled in defence. East Bengal took advantage of this when they struck in the 12th minute from a short corner. Miguel Ferreira sent a cross that was only partly cleared. The ball fell to Rashid outside the box, and he sent a low shot that went under goalkeeper Muheet Shabir’s glove.It was Rashid’s first goal for East Bengal.Punjab responded by moving higher up the field. Their equaliser came after an error inside the box. A header from Ricky Shabong struck Bipin Singh’s arm, and the referee awarded a penalty. Ramirez sent the spot kick past goalkeeper Prabhsukhan Singh Gill.East Bengal pushed back soon after. Just before half-time, Ferreira sent in another corner from the left. Sibille jumped higher than his marker and scored with a header. East Bengal coach Oscar Bruzon received a second yellow card while celebrating the goal.In the second half, East Bengal controlled more of the play. In the 56th minute, Bipin Singh moved down the left and took a shot that Shabir saved. Hiroshi Ibusuki reached the rebound but headed the ball off target.Punjab attempted to create openings through Suhail and Ramirez but could not break East Bengal’s defence.East Bengal scored again in the 71st minute.

LIVERPOOL: Virgil van Dijk says Mohamed Salah 's omission from Liverpool's team for a second successive match shows no player at the club has ""unlimited credit"". The Egypt international was an unused substitute for Sunday's win at West Ham and was on the bench for the 1-1 draw at home to Sunderland on Wednesday.It was the first time in his Anfield career that he had not started in back-to-back league matches.The forward was brought on for the second half against Sunderland but struggled to make an impact and is now goalless in five matches.Salah has scored just four Premier League goals for the struggling defending champions this season, in stark contrast to his haul of 29 last season.Liverpool captain Van Dijk was asked after the Sunderland draw whether Salah's omission had sent a message to the dressing room.""That's always been the case,"" he said. ""It's not like you have unlimited credit, everyone has to perform.""Mo has been doing that but the manager made that decision in the last two games. We all want the best for the club.""I am pretty sure Mo will still be a big part of what we are trying to achieve because he is an amazing player and he has shown it consistently.""Van Dijk praised playmaker Florian Wirtz, whose shot deflected in off Sunderland defender Nordi Mukiele for a late Liverpool equaliser that left them eighth in the table.The German, who joined Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer transfer window for £116 million ($155 million), is showing encouraging signs after a tough start to life at Anfield.""There's a very good reason why a club like us bought him,"" said Van Dijk. ""He's an outstanding, world-class player, in my eyes, who can only become even better but it will take a bit of time.""For him he has to stay level-headed. Don't get dragged into the outside world of when it's very good or very bad and don't get dragged into the numbers game.""Nowadays there are a lot of eyes on you if you score goals or have an assist or keep clean sheets but it is also about what you see and the contribution you have for the team.""","Virgil van Dijk says Mohamed Salah's omission shows no player has ""unlimited credit"" Egypt international was an unused substitute for Sunday's win at West Ham and was on the bench for the 1-1 draw at home to Sunderland on Wednesday.

Liverpool frustrated; Villa rise again

Arsenal tightened their grip at the top of the Premier League with a 2-0 win over Brentford on Wednesday, restoring their five-point cushion on a night that delivered shockwaves elsewhere.

Mikel Arteta ’s side were far from vintage at the Emirates Stadium but did enough to edge another step towards a first league title since 2003/04. Mikel Merino justified the decision to keep him in the starting XI ahead of a returning Viktor Gyokeres, powering in Ben White’s cross for his 11th goal of the season.“It’s unbelievable what he has done again today,” Arteta said. “The goal is magnificent — the movement, the quality, the finish… It’s phenomenal.”Bukayo Saka came off the bench on the hour mark to make sure of the win, delivering a fierce stoppage-time strike that Caoimhin Kelleher could not keep out.Leeds boss Daniel Farke entered the match under intense scrutiny after four straight defeats, but his side responded with a passionate, clinical display to climb out of the relegation zone. Jaka Bijol headed them ahead early, before Ao Tanaka lashed in a superb drive from the edge of the area.Pedro Neto offered Chelsea brief hope early in the second half, but a defensive calamity sealed their fate as Tosin Adarabioyo was dispossessed inside his box, allowing Dominic Calvert-Lewin to score. “A very poor night,” admitted Blues manager Enzo Maresca. “They deserved to win. They were better than us in all aspects.”Liverpool’s frustrations deepened as they were held 1-1 by Sunderland despite needing a late own-goal to salvage a point.

Erling Haaland carved his name deeper into Premier League folklore on Tuesday night, becoming the fastest player in history to reach 100 Premier League goals as Manchester City edged Fulham 5–4 in a pulsating contest at Craven Cottage. The Norwegian superstar reached the landmark in just 111 league appearances, obliterating Alan Shearer’s long-standing record of 124 matches.Haaland’s milestone moment came in the 17th minute when Jeremy Doku picked him out with a sharp cut-back. The striker timed his run perfectly and hammered a ferocious finish past Bernd Leno — his 15th league goal of the season and 20th in all competitions.Pep Guardiola could only marvel at his No. 9. “It’s incredible, impressive… He was unbelievable today,” the City boss said. “Hopefully he’s starving hungry to continue with this club to make more and more goals.”Haaland later turned provider, slipping a clever pass to Tijjani Reijnders for City’s second before Phil Foden took charge, scoring twice as City raced into a seemingly unassailable 5–1 lead.But the night nearly turned disastrous. Fulham mounted a furious comeback, with goals from Emile Smith Rowe, Alex Iwobi and a brace from Samuel Chukwueze dragging the match to the brink of a historic upset.Only Josko Gvardiol’s last-gasp goal-line clearance denied Josh King an equaliser in stoppage time.Despite the win, Guardiola looked exasperated as his side once again flirted with collapse. “Of course I was concerned,” he admitted. “This will help us in future games… I’m so old, and the players don’t respect me!” he joked, reflecting the tension of the chaotic final half hour.City, now just two points behind leaders Arsenal, know they will need Haaland firing relentlessly if they are to secure a seventh league title under Guardiola. After going three matches without a goal, the 25-year-old ended his mini-drought in style — with a record that may stand for generations.","Erling Haaland became the fastest player in Premier League history to reach 100 Premier League goals as Manchester City beat Fulham 5-4.

The Dutch striker had experienced a 24-game goalless streak in the league, raising questions about his £36 million transfer from Bologna in 2024.Zirkzee, aged 24, had not found the net in his previous eight appearances since April. Mount, who has faced injury setbacks since joining from Chelsea, celebrated only his second goal of the season.This victory marked United's first win since October, providing relief for Amorim after their recent loss to 10-man Everton at Old Trafford. The win was particularly significant as it ended Palace's unbeaten home record in the Premier League, which had stood since February 15.""There are no excuses"" for United's struggling start to the season, Amorim had stated earlier in the week.Casemiro nearly gave United an early lead within the first minute when a long throw created confusion in Palace's defense, but Dean Henderson saved his close-range shot.Mateta missed an opportunity at the other end, failing to score after getting past Leny Yoro with only goalkeeper Senne Lammens to beat. Lammens then made saves from Daichi Kamada's low shot and helped defend against Yeremy Pino's attempt.Palace took the lead in the 36th minute through a penalty. Yoro fouled Mateta, who initially scored but had his goal disallowed for a double-touch violation.A new rule implemented this season allows successful penalties with accidental double-touches to be retaken. This rule clarification followed Julian Alvarez's disallowed penalty for Atletico Madrid against Real Madrid last season.Mateta successfully converted his second attempt past Lammens. Zirkzee, who had been quiet in the first half, equalized in the 54th minute with a remarkable shot from a difficult angle after receiving Bruno Fernandes' free-kick.Shortly after scoring, Zirkzee almost contributed to an own goal when he deflected the ball toward his own net, but it was cleared to safety.Mount put United ahead in the 63rd minute, scoring from a free-kick assist by Fernandes. His low shot went under the Palace wall and past Henderson from 20 yards out.",Manchester United defeated Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park.

KOLKATA: Khalid Jamil seems to have a quick fix for stemming the rot in the Indian national football team — bringing more Ryan Williams-like Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) players to the table.Jamil’s stint with the Blue Tigers began with a creditable third-place finish in their maiden CAFA Nations Cup but it turned out to be false dawn earlier than anticipated with India failing to make the Asian Cup final round with back-to-back losses to Singapore and Bangladesh.“We need more OCI players like Williams in the national team,” Jamil said during an interaction with mediapersons on Saturday. “One or two more such players have been shortlisted and we’ll reveal their names once everything is confirmed. I feel it’s a good chance. It would be better if we have more Indian overseas players with Indian passport. If he’s available and playing outside, it would be very good. It would definitely improve our performance. In the last game (against Bangladesh) had Ryan Williams been there, we could have performed better,” Jamil remarked.After relinquishing his Australian passport to become an Indian citizen, Williams travelled to Dhaka as a member of Jamil’s squad but could not play because of the delay in getting the mandatory Fifa approval with respect to the change of member association.",Jamil’s stint with the Blue Tigers began with a creditable third-place finish in their maiden CAFA Nations Cup but it turned out to be false dawn earlier than anticipated.

Inter Miami head coach Javier Mascherano showered praise on Lionel Messi , calling him “extraordinary”, after the Argentine icon guided the club into their maiden MLS Cup final with a commanding 5-1 victory over New York City FC on Saturday.Miami’s charge to the championship match was led by a brilliant Tadeo Allende hat-trick, while Mateo Silvetti and Telasco Segovia also found the net in a dominant performance at Fort Lauderdale.Messi, 38, didn’t score on the night, but produced a moment of pure class when he set up Silvetti for Miami’s third goal. That assist came just as New York were closing in on an equaliser and effectively put the contest to bed.Mascherano, who previously shared the pitch with Messi for Barcelona and Argentina, said his star man continues to redefine what is possible.“Leo has spoiled us with the extraordinary,” Mascherano said. “He is unique, someone we won’t see again. Maybe people expected a goal today, but he brought calmness with that third goal. Only he can spot that pass. It basically ended the match.”Miami will now welcome either San Diego FC or the Vancouver Whitecaps, who face off later on Saturday, in next weekend’s MLS Cup final.The team enters the title clash in peak form, having smashed FC Cincinnati 4-0 in the previous round and now dismantling New York with similar ruthlessness.Allende was at the centre of Miami’s attacking storm once again. The 26-year-old struck first in the 14th minute after beating the offside trap, then doubled the lead with an outstanding header shortly after.New York responded through Justin Haak’s headed effort in the 37th minute and almost levelled when Julian Fernandez drew a superb save from Rocco Rios Novo in the 66th minute.That moment proved pivotal. Miami instantly countered, with Rodrigo De Paul and Jordi Alba combining before Messi threaded a perfectly weighted pass to Silvetti, who fired home for 3-1.Segovia made it 4-1 in the 83rd minute, and Allende completed his hat-trick a minute later, setting off huge celebrations.Mascherano credited the squad for turning around a season that once looked in disarray.“The players deserve the praise. They understood the direction we needed to take,” he said. “We grew stronger together and reached this stage with a real sense of unity. Everyone pulls in the same direction, and who starts doesn’t matter. The strength of this group is unshakeable.”",Inter Miami beat New York City FC 5-1 in MLS Eastern Conference final.

Taylor Swift’s June 13 wedding date with Travis Kelce reveals a hidden message longtime fans immediately recognized



The countdown for Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s wedding day is on, and the anticipation has already started shaping conversations among fans. With June 13 marked as their chosen date, the couple has sparked even more interest by tying it to a number that has followed Swift throughout her life and career. Their engagement became one of the most talked about moments of the year, and now their wedding plans are creating the same excitement. Every detail is under a microscope, from the date to the possible locations, as Swifties try to connect each piece to her long history of symbolic choices.According to Page Six, the Chiefs tight end and the “Opalite” singer plan to marry on June 13, 2026. Many fans were quick to highlight why this number matters to Swift. Born on Dec. 13, 1989, she has used 13 as a personal emblem in her music, branding and storytelling for years. Those steeped in her catalog know she plants these choices with intention, often turning them into easter eggs that her fans love to decode.Swift and Kelce began dating in the summer of 2023 and announced their engagement in August. Kelce proposed at his home in Missouri, getting down on one knee in the middle of a garden in the backyard.Their Instagram post sharing the moment showed joy that felt genuine and warm, giving fans a rare look into a relationship that has played out amid intense public attention.Reports suggest they are considering Rhode Island as a potential ceremony location. Swift owns a home there, and its private, coastal setting matches her desire for a quieter celebration. A second wedding might follow in Tennessee, a place tied closely to her rise as an artist. These plans have fueled curiosity, especially since Swift has embraced more privacy during the recent NFL season, choosing to avoid cameras and skipping her familiar tunnel entrances at Arrowhead Stadium.Some outlets, including the New York Post, mentioned June 13, 2025 as the possible date. That speculation only strengthened the idea that Swift’s connection to the number is central. As one excerpt noted, “Of course it would have to be Taylor Swift's lucky ‘13.’” Her career is full of examples. “Any Swiftie knows that ‘1989’ became arguably her greatest album of all time,” and songs like “The Lucky One” carry layers of 13 symbolism. Even her early work marked the pattern, with her first album going gold in 13 weeks.Wherever the ceremony takes place and whichever date they choose, one thing is certain. For Swift, 13 has never been unlucky. It has always been a sign that something big is coming.Also Read: Dak Prescott’s stats headline Cowboys’ season, yet Lions matchup tonight could dramatically swing the NFC playoff race",Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce announced their engagement in August.

"""I’m more than just a girlfriend"": Amon-Ra St. Brown’s girlfriend Brooklyn Adams shuts down NFL ‘WAG’ stereotype",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/im-more-than-just-a-girlfriend-amon-ra-st-browns-girlfriend-brooklyn-adams-shuts-down-nfl-wag-stereotype/articleshow/125778125.cms,"Amon Ra St. Brown and Brooklyn Adams (Getty Images and Instagram)

Brooklyn Adams rejects the “WAG” label



Amon Ra St. Brown and Brooklyn Adams’ relationship



Amon Ra St. Brown’s longtime girlfriend, Brooklyn Adams, is pushing back against a label that often follows women connected to pro athletes. The word “WAG” has lived online for years, part pop-culture shorthand and part internet stereotype. It catches attention, but it also boxes people in. Adams, who has supported St. Brown since their high school days, is one of the partners who no longer wants to fit inside that tidy category. Her views stand out at a time when more NFL and sports partners are speaking openly about what the label means to them.In an interview with People, published on Tuesday, November 2, Adams explained why the term never sat well with her. She said, “We’re more than wives and girlfriends of athletes. I have a name, and if you got to know me, then you’d realize that I’m more than just a girlfriend.” For the 26-year-old nursing graduate, the issue isn’t the attention that comes with dating a rising NFL star. It is about identity and being known for her own goals and achievements.Adams recently teamed up with Abercrombie for its “In Her Own League” campaign, which reframed WAG as “Woman Achieving Greatness and Success.”She appreciated the idea, but she still won’t claim the original title. She said, “I love that they put a spin on that. I don’t like the WAG title. Nothing against anybody who likes it. It’s cute that girls put their own twist on it. But to be given that title, I’m not a fan.”Not everyone in the sports world shares her outlook. Tennis influencer Morgan Riddle, who dates ATP player Taylor Fritz, told Glamour she “always embraced it,” comparing it to the word “influencer.” Several NFL partners feel the same way. Rachel Bush, wife of Jordan Poyer, has said she is unbothered by the label because she knows “there's other things going on with me.” Savanna Jackson, engaged to Malaki Starks, once called it “trendy” and appreciates the community it brings. She told People in October, “Especially being a rookie, a lot of the veterans, their wives and girlfriends definitely have been super helpful and so supportive because they've been through it and they get it.”Some partners sit firmly on Adams’ side. On a February episode of Not Gonna Lie, Kylie Kelce said she disliked the label because there is “a negative connotation [associated] with the term WAG.” Kristin Juszczyk agreed, saying the word “makes me crawl out of my skin.”The couple met during their sophomore year at Servite High School in Anaheim, California. They were paired for an English class project, which sparked a friendship that soon turned into something more. By the end of that school year, they began dating. College took them to different states, creating a long-distance relationship that tested their dedication.Through it all, Adams stayed close to St. Brown’s journey. She attended games, cheered him on online, and shared glimpses of their life together. Those posts have made them one of the most admired young couples in the NFL, proof that their bond has grown stronger than any label attached to it.Also Read: Joe Burrow’s viral reaction after Lane Kiffin leaves Ole Miss for LSU becomes the story everyone is talking about","Amon Ra St. Brown’s girlfriend, Brooklyn Adams, is pushing back against a label that often follows women connected to pro athletes.

The Richest Players in NFL History Will Shock You

Aaron Rodgers – 200 million dollars

Kirk Cousins – about 180 million dollars

Russell Wilson – 165 million dollars

Matthew Stafford – 150 million dollars

The NFL has grown into a financial powerhouse where players turn their on-field success into long-term business wins. Many stars earn far beyond their salaries through smart investments, brand deals, and ventures that keep paying even after retirement. Their financial journeys show how discipline, strategy, and timing can redefine an athlete’s legacy.This list dives straight into the league’s wealthiest names and how they built their fortunes. From record-setting quarterbacks to players who mastered the business world early, each story proves that money in football comes from far more than trophies. These athletes combined talent with opportunity and turned their careers into thriving financial empires.Tom Brady may have retired in 2023, but his financial reach continues to grow. Celebrity Net Worth places him at 300 million dollars, a figure built on decades of elite play and smart business decisions. In 2022 alone, he earned 75 million dollars from salary and endorsements with Aston Martin, Under Armour, and TAG Heuer. After leading the New England Patriots for 19 seasons and winning a seventh Super Bowl with Tampa Bay, he expanded his empire through a deal with Fox Sports and his wellness company TB12.Brady’s choices show how a player can turn fame into a long-term business platform.Aaron Rodgers remains one of the most accomplished quarterbacks in the NFL and one of its sharpest earners. Celebrity Net Worth estimates his wealth at 200 million dollars. His three-year, 150 million dollar extension with the Green Bay Packers in 2022 made him the highest-paid quarterback at that time. He later signed a one-year deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2025 worth an estimated 10 million dollars. Rodgers boosts his income with partnerships that include State Farm, Adidas, Pizza Hut, and Bose. He also invests in tech startups and real estate and is a minority owner of the Milwaukee Bucks.Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins built his fortune through consistent play and a focus on guaranteed money. Celebrity Net Worth places him near 180 million dollars. His steady rise comes from major contracts, brand deals like Tostitos, and smart investments. One source noted, “Cousins has had large guaranteed contracts, and endorsement deals.” His approach matches his own words: “I’m going to keep my head down and just keep working — that’s how I control my outcome. ” Cousins may not generate as many headlines as others, but his financial discipline makes him one of the league’s strongest earners.Russell Wilson signed a one-year, 10.5 million dollar deal with the New York Giants in 2025, but his largest payday came from a five-year, 245 million dollar contract with the Denver Broncos in 2022. Celebrity Net Worth estimates him at 165 million dollars. His endorsements include Nike, Bose, Amazon, and Mercedes-Benz. Wilson also invests actively, holding stakes in Seattle Sounders FC and his own clothing brand, Good Man Brand. Alongside his wife Ciara, he supports education and health initiatives through the Why Not You Foundation.Matthew Stafford helped deliver a Super Bowl win for the Los Angeles Rams in 2022 and strengthened his financial standing with a 160 million dollar contract extension the same year. The team restructured his deal in 2025 to guarantee more money for the upcoming seasons. With a net worth of 150 million dollars, he also profits from endorsements with Nike, Pepsi, and Ford. Stafford invests heavily in real estate, including a nearly 20 million dollar home in Los Angeles.

Danica Patrick’s claims paint a painful picture that still raises questions today

Danica Patrick | The Sage Steele Show

Former NASCAR star Danica Patrick’s emotional reflections on her split from NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers have resurfaced online, rekindling conversations around their turbulent past. Although her remarks were made in a May 2025 podcast interview, fans and analysts continue to revisit the fallout from a relationship that once appeared glamorous and supportive. Patrick and Rodgers, who dated from 2018 to 2020, were one of the most talked-about sports power couples at the time, even purchasing a Malibu home together.Yet years later, the tone of Patrick’s recollection suggests a troubling dynamic that remained hidden behind red-carpet photos and celebrity headlines. The resurfacing of her comments has sparked new conversations about emotional boundaries, accountability, and what high-profile breakups reveal only in hindsight.Patrick revealed on The Sage Steele Show that her breakup with Rodgers was the most difficult experience of her life, noting it “felt sudden” and left her emotionally depleted. She stated that “the nature of the relationship was emotionally abusive, so that wore me down to nothing.”Her claim that Rodgers “leaves a trail of blood” fueled immediate debate, especially because she insisted she wasn’t saying anything “earth-shattering.”Patrick explained that she ignored red flags because she believed she could “handle hard things,” admitting she pushed herself to try harder rather than walk away too soon. Ultimately, she says the painful experience became transformative: “It gave me the greatest gift ... of how much I needed to show up for myself and take care of myself.”While Rodgers never publicly addressed those specific allegations, he later reflected on their relationship more positively, crediting it with helping him explore mindfulness and spirituality. That contrast continues to fascinate fans, showing how two people can walk away from the same relationship with entirely different narratives.Years later, Patrick’s remarks remain a reminder that emotional strain doesn’t always surface until long after the spotlight fades.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers latest injury update: Pittsburgh confronts harsh reality after brutal hit leaves QB shaken","Former NASCAR star Danica Patrick’s emotional reflections on her split from NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers have resurfaced online.

Lili Reinhart reveals her awkward yet wholesome encounter with Sarah Paulson

Fans are used to seeing celebrities shrug off their fame, but even Hollywood stars experience moments of pure fan excitement. Lili Reinhart proved it on a recent episode of Kylie Kelce’s podcast Not Gonna Lie, which aired on November 21, where the Riverdale actress recalled being starstruck in the most unexpected place: her aesthetician’s office.Reinhart explained that she wasn’t preparing for a red carpet, a film set, or an industry party, she was simply waiting for a facial when she suddenly came face-to-face with an actor she has admired for years. What happened next turned into a hilariously relatable story about nerves, blushing, and meeting your idols without warning.During the conversation, Kylie Kelce asked Reinhart whether she had ever been starstruck. Without hesitation, Reinhart admitted, “Definitely. It happened to me two weeks ago.”She went on to explain that she has admired Sarah Paulson since American Horror Story’s first season, and has even followed her online. Reinhart joked that when Paulson followed her back on Instagram, she assumed it had to be a mistake: “Which I thought was a genuine mistake because why?”That confusion turned into shock when Paulson walked out of a treatment room.Reinhart recalled, “I was sitting in the waiting room ready to get my facial, and she came out, and I was like, Okay, well, we're going to finally meet.” Paulson greeted her warmly, saying, “Oh, you're so great.” Reinhart admitted she turned bright red: “I blushed really hard.

Her death at age 45, announced in December 2025 through a posthumous message on Instagram, left fans stunned, especially those who followed her journey not only as a gifted hip-hop dancer, but as a mother, reality TV personality, and cancer warrior.Even through her divorce from country artist Coffey Anderson, with whom she raised three children, Criscilla continued to share her story with surprising openness. She showed audiences how to fight fiercely, celebrate joy loudly, and hold onto hope even when answers didn’t come.Born in Los Angeles and raised between California and Las Vegas, Criscilla spent years dancing for music icons such as Britney Spears, Rihanna, and Snoop Dogg. Her career evolved from center stage performer to respected mentor when she became a choreographer and occasional judge for the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. She called the experience “such a highlight of my career,” proudly celebrating the squad she referred to as “America’s sweethearts.Beyond professional success, she welcomed three children with Coffey Anderson, whom she met at church before marrying in 2009. Their family life, from holidays and parenthood to her cancer diagnosis, became the centerpiece of their Netflix series Country Ever After.Her battle with stage 4 colon cancer began in 2018, and though she announced being cancer-free by 2021, it returned aggressively the following year. Still, she refused to let fear overshadow gratitude. In 2022, she said, “The thing with cancer is that the chances of it returning are very, very high,” describing how she learned to “celebrate all the victories” while preparing her mind for setbacks.Her final words, shared posthumously, reflected unwavering strength: “If you’re reading this, I’ve finally slipped into the arms of Jesus… Please don’t stay in the darkness of this moment.” She left one last message for her children, promising, “When a moment feels warm, familiar… that’s me. I’m still mothering you.” Criscilla Anderson may be gone, but her impact; artistic, spiritual, and maternal, remains impossible to forget.Also Read: “Very very tiring”: Dallas Cowboys cheerleader reveals the emotional and physical toll of the team’s festive season demands","Criscilla Anderson, choreographer for the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, has passed away at 45.

"“A witch”: Tom Brady’s legacy was allegedly powered by Gisele Bündchen’s rumored witchcraft, not just his talent",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/a-witch-tom-bradys-legacy-was-allegedly-powered-by-gisele-bndchens-rumored-witchcraft-not-just-his-talent/articleshow/125766090.cms,"Gisele Bündchen faced internet speculation labeling her a witch after Tom Brady revealed her spiritual game-day rituals. Instead of denying the claims, Bündchen embraced her connection to spirituality and nature, reframing the narrative in a Vanity Fair interview. Her unapologetic authenticity became a lesson in staying true to oneself, regardless of public perception.

How the witch rumors exploded and why Gisele Bündchen didn’t run from them

Back in 2023, one of the internet’s strangest celebrity theories took aim at Gisele Bündchen. Fans weren’t debating a new runway look or her post-divorce life with Tom Brady, instead, social media circles were trying to label the Brazilian supermodel a witch. The rumor spread after Brady himself revealed that Bündchen practiced a series of spiritual game-day rituals, from crystals to handwritten mantras.But when the model finally addressed the claims in a Vanity Fair cover story that year, she didn’t distance herself from the practices. Instead, she embraced them, speaking with candor about her connection to spirituality and the natural world. The headlines may have been sensational, but Bündchen’s response became a lesson in staying unapologetically authentic.The conversation began years before her divorce, when Brady admitted that his wife created an “altar” for him before games and asked him to use “healing stones” and mantras. He famously shared, “I stopped questioning her a long time ago. I just shut up and listen.” Bündchen’s rituals became a topic of fascination on TikTok’s #WitchTok, where users half-jokingly credited her for Brady’s success on the field.When the witch rumors resurfaced after the couple’s 2022 divorce, Bündchen didn’t lash out, she reframed the narrative.Speaking from her Costa Rican home surrounded by crystals, tarot cards, and spiritual books, she explained that her practices were rooted in energy and nature, not spells.“If you want to call me a witch because I love astrology, I love crystals, I pray, I believe in the power of nature, then go ahead,” she said. The model humorously added she preferred being described as “a witch of love.”She even recalled Brady’s famous joke from 2019, when after a Super Bowl win, she teased him saying, “You’re lucky you married a witch, I’m just a good witch.”Looking back, the episode shows how celebrity culture has a habit of turning spirituality into spectacle. Yet Bündchen’s stance made it clear: whatever label people try to put on her, she’ll continue drawing power from the same place she always has; nature, intention, and a belief in love over superstition.Also Read: Tom Brady “got screwed” for ignoring the biggest red flag in his marriage: Gisele Bündchen’s past with Leonardo DiCaprio","Gisele Bündchen faced internet speculation labeling her a witch after Tom Brady revealed her spiritual game-day rituals.

Blake Lively believes Taylor Swift will ‘come running’ back after her lawsuit win hopes it leads to a Kelce wedding invite,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/blake-lively-believes-taylor-swift-will-come-running-back-after-her-lawsuit-win-hopes-it-leads-to-a-kelce-wedding-invite/articleshow/125765484.cms,"Blake Lively is reportedly feeling emotionally lighter after a recent legal victory, leading to hopes of mending her friendship with Taylor Swift. The stars had previously distanced themselves publicly as a survival tactic. However, Lively and Ryan Reynolds are reportedly ""shocked"" by Swift's potentially massive wedding guest list, hinting at new challenges for their reunion.

A legal win, a hopeful reconnection, and shock over a growing wedding guest list

Blake Lively may be stepping into one of the most unexpected chapters of her public life, and it has nothing to do with a movie set or red-carpet reveal. The actress, who recently celebrated a major legal win after a defamation case tied to the Justin Baldoni controversy was dismissed, is reportedly starting to “walk lighter” emotionally. Sources suggest that the ruling didn’t just remove a legal burden, it shifted her mindset, reconnecting her with parts of her life she’d quietly put on pause.One of those rumored pauses involves her long-running friendship with Taylor Swift , a relationship that has fueled joint family celebrations, inside jokes, and major pop-culture moments. Now, insiders believe Lively sees space to mend the gap that formed while both stars navigated heavy scrutiny at the same time.According to reports, Lively and Swift intentionally stepped back from their public connection “as a survival tactic” amid media frenzy. The source described that distance as strategic rather than emotional, saying, “It wasn’t personal… Both were drowning in headlines they didn’t ask for.”With the lawsuit resolved, Lively is said to be optimistic about restoring the bond, telling insiders she misses “the families, the laughter, the old comfort.”One source even claimed she believes Swift will “come running once this legal cloud is gone.”Yet, just as one door seems to open, another complication may be emerging, Swift’s rumored wedding guest list. The list, reportedly massive, has allegedly “shocked” Lively and Ryan Reynolds, raising concerns about potential chaos overshadowing the ceremony. Swift has publicly joked that she would invite “anyone I ever talked to,” hinting at an unusually large celebration as she plans her future with Travis Kelce While no final guest decisions are confirmed, the intrigue suggests that even a mended friendship might face new hurdles, proving that in celebrity circles, reunions come with their own kind of plot twists.Amid the speculation, fans are equally fixated on what Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s wedding could look like. With Swift’s global fandom and Kelce’s camp of NFL supporters, the event is expected to merge two massive worlds. Industry watchers predict everything from high-security protocols to destination-style planning, as the couple continues navigating fame at its peak.Whether Lively finds a spot on the final invite list or not, the upcoming celebration is already being framed as the celebrity wedding of the decade, one that could reshape Hollywood-NFL alliances in unexpected ways.Also Read: Taylor Swift makes another drastic change to her wedding vision with Travis Kelce, hinting at a more personal ceremony","Blake Lively is reportedly feeling lighter after a recent legal victory.

The house of Don Bradman: A must-visit for cricket pilgrims in Australia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/the-house-of-don-bradman-a-must-visit-for-cricket-pilgrims-in-australia/articleshow/116154966.cms,"ADELAIDE : This is a story about a house. Not just any house, but a house which used to be a home. It’s not a new story, just one that never gets old. Many versions of it have passed down the generations. For some, the house is a temple, a pilgrimage, a revered place on hallowed land, a place that is very important. An institution, even.Others may pass by it for years without noticing anything remarkable, or indeed never look at it at all. You may live next to it and not even know it exists. Yet there it stands, the house, in its lonesome, defiant splendour, a living, breathing artifact of cricketing history. A world now lost, but not forgotten.A short drive away from Adelaide’s business district takes one to the leafy eastern suburbs of Kensington Park , where the smoke and grime of the city and the constant thrum of traffic gives way to quietude. Sounds, if any, are of a more arboreal nature. A dog barks in the distance. The entry of our vehicle has broken its reverie.Suddenly, it is upon us, 2 Holden Street , a red-brick house with sparkling white window frames. It’s not in ruins, far from it. Effort has been made to keep it pristine, like you would a prized antique. It even looks lived-in from the outside, until you think about it. This is where Donald Bradman , who some say was the greatest batsman to ever live and breathe, stayed for a quarter century. The house has been missing its master for as long, for Bradman died on Feb 25, 2001.Like Bradman’s batting average, the house seems a statistical anomaly. Visitors aren’t allowed inside the Neo-Georgian two-storied structure, but the trees look manicured. Designed by the architect Philip Claridge for Bradman, it doesn’t look unassuming but isn’t imposing. If anything, it’s distinctly suburban. The gates, bygone iron hinges from another era, have modern padlocks. There’s a security service warning at the gate.This isn’t Bradman’s ancestral home, of course, for that lies in Bowral, New South Wales, where he grew up, and is a story for another day. Bradman and his wife Jessie moved to South Australia in 1934, a half decade before the War, seeking peace and quiet. There wasn’t to be any. As is well known, he lost his first born in infancy in 1936, a second son contracted polio here and a daughter was born with cerebral palsy.Add to that the constant attentionseekers, which led the Don to rename his letterbox 2A, an intentional red herring. The house was heritage-listed in 2004, though the first such attempt was stopped by the Don in 1987. “People just want to see my signature before I die,” he had once lamented.Only the nearby Kensington Oval, home to the Kensington District Cricket Club which the Don captained, offers a string of attached storylines. The Bradman house now has no office, no memorabilia, some of which was shifted to the Adelaide Oval. Not too long ago, in 1998, Sachin Tendulkar famously visited Bradman here on his 90th birthday for a cup of afternoon tea and a chat. Now, there is no one to talk to. Nothing to see. There’s still plenty to feel, though.“Aww, c’mon mate, it’s just a bloody house,” screams the waiting taxi driver, and the spell is broken. It’s time to leave the Don’s house tucked away in a corner of cricketing history, where like its master it prefers to remain undisturbed.","Donald Bradman lived at 2 Holden Street in the leafy eastern suburbs of Kensington Park for a quarter century.

'Foolhardy': Former pacer blasts suggestions for Rohit Sharma to open at Gabba,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/foolhardy-former-pacer-blasts-suggestions-for-rohit-sharma-to-open-at-gabba/articleshow/116146949.cms,"Rohit Sharma. (AP Photo)

Former fast bowler Dodda Ganesh has advised against India's captain Rohit Sharma opening the batting in the crucial third Test against Australia at the Gabba. He believes it's a risky move considering Rohit's current form and the challenging Brisbane conditions.India's batting order has been a topic of discussion following their performances in the first two Tests. They were bowled out for 150 in the first innings of the Perth Test and 180 in Adelaide.India won the Perth Test by a significant margin of 295 runs, thanks to centuries from Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli. However, they suffered a heavy defeat in Adelaide, losing by 10 wickets within three days.There's been discussion about Rohit returning to the opening position. He missed the first Test and batted in the middle order in the second, allowing KL Rahul to open with Jaiswal.Ganesh expressed his concerns on social media regarding Rohit opening the batting.""Rohit Sharma is already short of confidence and runs. Experts urging him to open at the Gabba is foolhardy, to say the least. The series is not being played in the sub-continent where he can throw his bat and get some runs. It will be a lamb to the slaughterhouse if he opens,"" Ganesh posted on X.Ganesh believes Rohit's lack of confidence and the demanding Australian conditions could lead to further struggles.Rohit's performance in SENA countries (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia) has been a subject of discussion throughout his career. In 46 innings in these conditions, he averages less than 30, contrasting sharply with his strong performances in the subcontinent.While Rohit has experienced some success as an opener, his average of 37.8 in SENA countries in this role is significantly influenced by his performance in the 2021 series in England.His impressive 127 at The Oval is a highlight, achieved through technical adjustments to handle swing and seam bowling.

NEW DELHI: Legendary Kapil Dev has always been a passionate advocate for sports, and over the years, golf has become one of his closest companions.Reflecting on his love story with golf, Kapil, replying to a question raised by TimesofIndia.com, candidly shared that had he played golf alongside cricket , he believes it would have sharpened his focus, potentially adding 2,000 more runs to his cricketing tally.""If you play golf, you understand,"" Kapil remarked at the launch of the Vishwa Samudra Open on Monday afternoon. ""I thought cricketers were mad. In the evening, they only talk about cricketers. A golfer is a thousand times madder than a cricketer. They lie in bed at night thinking, 'I should have played that shot better, I missed that putt.'""Kapil's comparison between golf and cricket shines a light on the mental focus required for both sports. He explained that while golf may seem easier when you step onto the course, it can often lead to surprising results.""That’s the beauty of this game - even when you're sleeping, you're thinking, 'If only that putt had gone in, it would have been so much fun.' I think it's really fascinating. When you first step onto a golf course, you feel like you'll play 10-12 under par, but when you finish, you're usually 10-12 over par. The mind is sharp, but the body doesn't always respond the same way,"" he shared with a laugh.Opening up about how golf could have influenced his cricketing career, Kapil said, ""I am not saying that I have played cricket to the highest level. But I wish I'd played golf while playing cricket.

With 5,248 runs in Tests, 434 wickets, and 3,783 runs in ODIs, he is considered one of cricket's finest all-rounders.Most notably, Kapil led India to its first-ever World Cup victory in 1983, a historic moment that changed the trajectory of Indian cricket forever.","Kapil Dev has always been a passionate advocate for sports, and over the years, golf has become one of his closest companions.

Rohit Sharma press conference after loss in Adelaide Test vs Australia

Rohit Sharma's struggle continues

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer and national selector, Jatin Paranjape , maintains his faith in Rohit Sharma 's capabilities, despite the captain's underwhelming performance in the crushing defeat to Australia in Adelaide. He expects Rohit to bounce back in the three remaining matches of the series.Returning to the number six position in Test cricket after a lengthy gap of six years, Rohit managed only nine runs across both innings at Adelaide Oval. His recent Test form has been concerning, with an average of just 11.83 in his previous six matches.Questions have also been raised about Rohit's captaincy decisions, particularly regarding his bowling strategies and field placements.This was evident during Travis Head 's dominant 140-run innings, where India's tactical approach appeared passive, with minimal use of short-pitched deliveries despite Head's known difficulties against such bowling, and defensive field settings.""I know he’s had a really bad run in the last few Test innings. But I think form is temporary, and class is permanent. I have a very, very good feeling about Rohit Sharma coming good, as let’s not forget that he’s a Mumbai batter.""They are known to kind of win against you when things are hard. I thought he was a bit off-colour in this Test match at Adelaide, but I’m sure that he will bounce back There’s nothing wrong in his batting, but he just needs to get an hour or two under his belt on the field,"" Paranjape told IANS.He also believes Rohit should resume his role as an opener in the third Test in Brisbane, starting on December 14.""Being back in the opener’s slot is something which is a comfort area for him. So I expect him to come back into the top slot to open with Jaiswal and have KL Rahul batting at five. I also thought he was a bit off with his captaincy on the first couple of days and I’m sure he will turn it around in the next three matches to come.""","Former Indian cricketer and national selector, Jatin Paranjape, maintains his faith in Rohit Sharma's capabilities.

Ruben Amorim 's Manchester United honeymoon is truly over after Nottingham Forest inflicted a second straight Premier League defeat on his side on Saturday while Manchester City stumbled again.Leaders Liverpool maintained their seven-point lead at the top of the table even though their match at Everton was postponed because of storms on Merseyside. Amorim replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford last month after a terrible start to the season.He began brightly, with a draw and two wins in his first three games.But reality is starting to bite hard after a 2-0 Premier League defeat at Arsenal in midweek followed by Saturday's chastening 3-2 loss to high-flying Forest, who capitalised on United's defensive blunders.United forward Rasmus Hojlund cancelled out Nikola Milenkovic's early goal at Old Trafford, but Morgan Gibbs-White and Chris Wood put the visitors in charge. Forest kept the home side at bay after Bruno Fernandes pulled one back.United's Andre Onana was embarrassed by a swerving Gibbs-White strike for Forest's second while the goalkeeper, Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs De Ligt all failed to deal with a looping Wood header for the third.The win lifts Forest to fifth in the Premier League table. United are languishing in 13th spot.""Tough game in a tough moment but we have to continue the job,"" a disappointed Amorim told the BBC.""This is a long journey. We are improving in some aspects. We have to win games to help us improve the team.""We are in the start of something so big that we pay attention to every detail. We already know it's a big job so we have to continue.""Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo said ""I'm very proud of the way we work together, build things together, from the owner to everyone else in the club.""It's a moment to celebrate. But for me, I'm thinking about (next week's match against) Aston Villa.""Manchester City failed to win for the eighth time in nine games in a 2-2 draw at Crystal Palace Pep Guardiola's men had the chance to go second in the table but failed to build on an encouraging 3-0 win over Forest in midweek.Daniel Munoz fired the home team ahead early but Erling Haaland's towering header levelled the score.The visitors started the second half strongly but were hit with a sucker punch when Maxence Lacroix powered home Will Hughes' corner.Rico Lewis found the top corner to level once more for City, but was then sent off six minutes from time.""We fought incredible.

Jude Bellingham guided champions Real Madrid to a comfortable 3-0 victory at Girona on Saturday in La Liga , with Kylian Mbappe also on the scoresheet after two high-profile penalty misses in recent games.Los Blancos cut the gap on league leaders Barcelona to two points after the Catalans drew 2-2 at Real Betis , with Madrid having played one fewer match.Bellingham opened the scoring before half-time and set up Turkish playmaker Arda Guler for Madrid's second, before Mbappe produced a clinical finish for their third.Both Bellingham and defender Ferland Mendy were replaced with apparent knocks in the second half ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash at Atalanta.Coach Carlo Ancelotti confirmed Bellingham was ""available"" for the game but said Mendy had suffered a muscular injury.After Madrid's fifth defeat across all competitions in midweek against Athletic Bilbao, having lost just twice last season, Ancelotti pledged his team would improve and they were significantly better against Girona.""Bellingham scored his fifth goal running (in La Liga), Mbappe scored, Brahim (Diaz) did good work, Arda scored a great goal,"" Ancelotti said.""We have to bear the moment out and as I said, bit by bit we will come back (to form).""With Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo sidelined, Ancelotti selected Bellingham and Diaz in support of Mbappe.The French forward has been the focus of criticism in recent weeks after blowing penalties against Liverpool and Athletic Bilbao, and struggling to find the form which made him a star with Paris Saint-Germain and his country.Girona, who ran Madrid close for the Spanish title for much of last season before eventually finishing third, started the stronger but Madrid soon clicked into gear.Bellingham pounced after 36 minutes when Diaz's cross was blocked and the ball fell kindly to the England international to drill home.It was Bellingham's fifth goal in his last five La Liga games, finding the form which powered Madrid to a Champions League and La Liga double last season.Los Blancos got their second in the 55th minute when Bellingham threaded through a fine pass for Guler to finish.Mbappe rattled in Madrid's third from a tight angle after Bellingham hobbled off with a knock after Luka Modric played him in down the right.Ancelotti will hope Madrid can carry some momentum into the vital Champions League visit to Atalanta, for which Vinicius is expected to return from a hamstring problem.Girona, eighth in La Liga, welcome Liverpool in the Champions League on Tuesday.Earlier Real Betis twice came behind to stop Barcelona from triumphing in Seville.Assane Diao levelled in the 94th minute to stun Barcelona, who opened the scoring after 39 minutes through Robert Lewandowski.After Giovani Lo Celso levelled for the mid-table hosts from the penalty spot, substitute Ferran Torres struck what seemed the winner before Diao's late intervention.Barcelona coach Hansi Flick said his team had to improve on the road, where most of their set-backs have come this season.""We have the quality to win every match but we also have to show that,"" said Flick.""(In) the away matches we have to be much stronger than we played here.""Real Betis started strongly, with Raphinha forced to clear Diego Llorente's header off his own goal-line.The electric Yamal helped Barcelona get on top as Betis sat deep and the Catalans found the breakthrough shortly before the break with a slick move finished by Lewandowski.It was the 36-year-old striker's 16th league goal of the campaign and he leads the charts in Spain.The hosts levelled with a penalty converted by Lo Celso, when Frenkie de Jong stepped on the heel of Vitor Roque, on loan at Betis from Barca, with Flick sent off for protesting.""I'm really disappointed about (my red card), I thought that would never happen to me,"" Flick told reporters.Torres netted his second goal in two games to put Barca back in front before Diao struck late on.""I'm very happy with the goal,"" said the 19-year-old forward.

NEW DELHI: Former world number one tennis player from Romania Simona Halep has raised concerns about the perceived discrepancies in the treatment of cases involving positive tests for banned substances by the International Tennis Integrity Agency ( ITIA ).Her criticism stems from the recent one-month ban imposed on Iga Swiatek , the current world number two, after testing positive for the heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in an out-of-competition sample.Halep, who returned to tennis in March 2023 after serving a provisional suspension since October 2022 for testing positive for roxadustat at the US Open, believes there is a lack of consistency in the ITIA's approach.She questions the significant difference in the penalties handed out to her and Swiatek, despite the cases occurring around the same time.In her statement, Halep expressed her bewilderment at the disparate treatment and questioned the logical reasoning behind the ITIA's decisions. She accused the organization of attempting to ""destroy"" her career, despite the evidence presented, and claimed to have suffered from the perceived injustice.“I have always believed in good, I have believed in the fairness of this sport, I have believed in kindness,"" Halep wrote on Instagram. “The injustice that was done to me was painful, is painful and maybe will always be painful.

The 29-year-old former world champion acknowledges that staying injury-free is crucial as she moves forward.“This (win) will definitely give me a lot of confidence.

Being smart and experienced is key, and I'm definitely going to play for the next couple of years.”Sindhu recognizes the benefits of experience at her age.

The semifinal was nearly a 40-minute battle, and it took a heavy toll on his body. He fought well initially but his body didn’t support him in the second game. But overall, it was a good performance. He was the first player from Rajasthan to reach the U-13 National Championship final,” said Satvik’s coach Braj Raj Singh Shekhawat while talking to TOI on Saturday.Satvik, who trains at DMR Badminton Academy, ousted eleventh seed S Linesh Vaibav of Tamil Nadu 21-18, 22-20 in the semis, while in the quarters he got the better of seventh seed Krishav Puppala of Telangana 21-13, 21-19 in 35 minutes.Another Jaipur shuttler Anvi Rathore was unlucky to lose in the U-13 girls singles semis.

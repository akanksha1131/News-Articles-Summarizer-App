NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli is renowned for his dynamic and passionate engagement with the crowd, which has become an integral part of his persona both on and off the field.The former Indian captain often teases the crowd during matches, adding an element of entertainment to the game. His ability to interact and sometimes lightheartedly provoke the fans has made him a crowd favorite.Kohli is famous for his ""finger on the lips"" gesture to silence rival fans after performing well, such as hitting a crucial boundary or taking a big wicket. This cheeky response often intensifies the crowd's energy.With Australia chasing a 162-run target against India on Day 3 of the fifth Test in Sydney on Sunday, Prasidh Krishna gave a ray of hope with a three-wicket burst in the absence of Jasprit Bumrah Krishna dismissed Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith before lunch to reduce Australia to 58/3.Steve Smith fell one run short of 10,000 Test runs landmark and it was after his dismissal that charged up Virat Kohli.All riled up, Kohli was seen engaging with the crowd and imitating some of the incidents from the sandpaper scandal in South Africa. The crowd loved it too and continued their cheers and jeers.Cricket Australia shared a clip of the video on X:The Steve Smith sandpaper scandal, often referred to as the ""Sandpapergate"", was one of the most infamous episodes in modern cricket history. It occurred during Australia's tour of South Africa in March 2018 during the third Test match in Cape Town.During the match, Cameron Bancroft , an Australian player, was caught on camera using a piece of sandpaper to tamper with the cricket ball in an attempt to alter its condition and gain reverse swing for the bowlers. The footage showed Bancroft rubbing the ball with sandpaper and then attempting to hide it in his trousers when he realized he was being filmed by the cameras.Steve Smith, then the captain of the Australian team, admitted in a press conference that the leadership group had devised the plan to tamper with the ball.Smith confessed to being aware of the plan but did not intervene to stop it, acknowledging his failure as a leader and was banned from international and domestic cricket for 12 months and stripped of his captaincy.Smith broke down in a tearful press conference, expressing remorse and taking full responsibility for his actions and the incident tarnished Smith's image, despite his status as one of the greatest batsmen of his generation.","Virat Kohli is renowned for his dynamic and passionate engagement with the crowd.

Poll Should Prasidh Krishna Be a Regular in the Indian Cricket Team? No Yes

IND vs AUS: Prasidh Krishna on Jasprit Bumrah, Virat Kohli captaincy, mood in team and more

NEW DELHI: The Indian dressing room was all smiles as Prasidh Krishna let the ball do the talking when Australia began their chase on Day 3 of the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground.In the absence of Jasprit Bumrah, Prasidh stepped up and delivered just as Bumrah is known to — making crucial early breakthroughs for his team.The Karnataka pacer dismissed Sam Konstas (22), Marnus Labuschagne (6), and Steve Smith (4) in quick succession. However, Bumrah's absence due to back spasms looms large, as India are without a third specialist pacer.Prasidh's dismissal of Labuschagne was followed by a significant scalp—Steve Smith, who fell just one run short of reaching 10,000 Test runs. Prasidh bowled a sharp, rising delivery that Smith awkwardly fended to gully, where Yashasvi Jaiswal dived forward to complete a brilliant catch.The stunning effort from Jaiswal charged up Rohit Sharma , who was seen leaping out of his seat in celebration in the dressing room.Meanwhile, Rohit, addressing retirement rumors on Saturday, clarified his decision to step aside for theSCG Test .""I have not retired. I stood down, that is what I would say. Basically, the chat that I had with the coach and the selector was very simple. That I am not able to score runs, there is no form, it is an important match, and we need a player with form. As it is, in our batting, the form of the boys is not that good,"" Rohit told Star Sports.""So you cannot carry a lot of out-of-form players in the team. This simple thing was going on in my mind. I am not going anywhere. That is why I wanted to tell the coach and the selector that this is what is going on in my mind.""They backed my decision. They said that you have been playing for so many years. You know what you are doing. So for me, it was difficult to take this decision. But if everything is kept in front, then this decision was sensible. I will not think much further,"" he added.","Prasidh Krishna makes crucial early breakthroughs for India.

NEW DELHI: Sachin Tendulkar has one of the largest and most devoted fan followings in the history of sports. His incredible achievements, humility, and consistency over a career spanning more than two decades have endeared him to fans worldwide.In India, Tendulkar is more than just a cricket player-he is a cultural phenomenon.

I remember my first Test tour to India, I didn't play in any of the two Tests, but we were sitting there in the second Test in Bangalore (Bengaluru) and Sachin Tendulkar was playing, he had scored some runs and he was coming close to a hundred and all of a sudden Bangalore's stadium was full and louder, more than anything I had ever experienced in cricket. He got to his hundred, they all went nuts and then disappeared. And then he got close to 200, they all came back and it got louder, he got 200, it was loud again and they all disappeared. In terms of some of those big name players, it is extremely loud.""Tendulkar's records, including being the first to score 100 international centuries and amassing over 34,000 international runs, have cemented his legacy, making him an idol for aspiring cricketers worldwide.Tendulkar is admired not only by fans but also by fellow cricketers, athletes, and celebrities, who often express their respect for his skill and demeanor.Sachin's fan base is not just about numbers; it's about the deep emotional connection people feel with him.

IND vs AUS: Rishabh Pant on dropped Rohit Sharma, criticism, Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: If the opening day of the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground was dramatic, Day 2 brought even more high-octane action. After bowling out India for a modest 185 on a grassy SCG pitch, Australia found themselves in trouble at the start of their first innings. Jasprit Bumrah , who dismissed Usman Khawaja late on Day 1, struck again early on Day 2 by removing Marnus Labuschagne. Mohammed Siraj then took center stage, producing a game-changing over that left Australia reeling.Siraj’s first breakthrough came with a superb outswinger to Sam Konstas, who drove with hard hands and edged it to Yashasvi Jaiswal at gully, where a stunning catch was taken.Siraj followed it up with another outswinger, this time slightly shorter, which induced a thick edge from Travis Head. The ball flew to KL Rahul at second slip, who made no mistake.Siraj was visibly pumped after his two-wicket burst, with Virat Kohli joining the celebrations in trademark fashion—jumping and pumping his fists with enthusiasm.Kohli then turned to the crowd, waving his arms to fire them up, adding to the electrifying atmosphere at the SCG.Australia, leading 2-1, need a win or a draw to reclaim the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after a decade.

Another controversy erupted early on the first morning of the fifth Test between India and Australia in Sydney when a relay catch involving Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne off Virat Kohli 's bat was ruled by the third umpire as not legitimate.With Indian openers KL Rahul (4) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (10) dismissed early, India were 17 for 2 when Kohli came in to bat and edged the first ball he faced from Scott Boland to the slips, where the Aussie players claimed the relay catch between Smith and Labuschagne.Diving low to his right, Smith believed to have got his fingers underneath the ball before lobbing it in the air for Labuschagne to complete the catch. The decision was referred by the on-field umpires for review, and the third umpire ruled that the ball grazed the ground before Smith lobbed it back up.Talking to Fox Cricket at the lunch break, Smith said he has no doubt that it was a clean catch, but they have to accept the decision taken by the match officials.""Did you get your hand underneath that ball?"" former England player turned commentator Isa Guha asked Smith?""100%, no denying it whatsoever. But the umpires made the decision, and we move on,"" replied Smith.After replays were shown on the giant screen and the third umpire announced his view, Kohli was seen shaking his head with a wry smile on his face.India went to lunch at a shaky 57 for 3, losing Shubman Gill (20) off the last ball delivered by off-spinner Nathan Lyon before the break, leaving Kohli on the crease at 20 not out. He was joined by Rishabh Pant post lunch.Earlier, India left captain Rohit Sharma out of the eleven, with Jasprit Bumrah doing the leadership duty and chose to bat first after winning the toss.India made two changes to their team. Shubman Gill took Rohit's place, while Prasidh Krishna came in for fellow pacer Akash Deep who is out with a back injury.","Third umpire rules Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne's relay catch off Virat Kohli not legitimate.

Mitchell Starc dismissed KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal fell to Scott Boland.

But the third umpire took his time and signalled it not out and Kohli survived falling for a first ball duck.But former Australian opener and coach Justin Langer maintained that Kohli was out.7Cricket shared a post on X with Langer saying, ""From what I have seen there, that makes it more obvious to me that should have been out. Steve Smith had his fingers (underneath the ball), and you could see he was flicking the ball up, it was brilliant what he did. He had his fingers under the ball, he flicked it up deliberately and in my opinion that's out.""Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting also shared his views on the decision, ""As far as I was concerned, if (the ball) had've come out of (Smith's) hand, he wouldn't have been able to scoop it up. That's what I'm saying, I think his fingers are clearly underneath the ball ... look where his pointer figure is there, it's still underneath the ball.""Kohli, from 10 Tests and 19 innings in 2024, scored 417 runs at an average of 24.52 with one hundred and one fifty.That century by Virat was the unbeaten 100 he scored in the first Test in Perth - the match that India won by 295 runs.",India lost openers KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal early after captain Jasprit Bumrah won the toss and opted to bat against Australia.

India XI:

NEW DELHI: In keeping with what TimesofIndia.com had reported a day prior, instead of Rohit Sharma it was Jasprit Bumrah who came for the toss against Australia for the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday.Bumrah won the toss in overcast conditions and a grassy pitch and opted to bat first.India made two changes in their playing XI from the last Test with Shubman Gill replacing Rohit Sharma and Prasidh Krishna coming in for Akash Deep.After winning the toss, Bumrah said, ""We are looking to bat first. We have played some good cricket. The last match was exciting. The grass doesn't look spicy. We always have learnt to digest defeats.

Sydney: ""We're going to have a look at the wicket and finalise it tomorrow."" ""As I just said, we're going to have a look at the wicket and announce playing 11 tomorrow.""India head coach Gautam Gambhir responded when he was quizzed about the playing XI on eve of the fifth and final Test in Sydney.It was a typical response but what spiced up proceedings was the fact that he was categorically asked about Rohit Sharma 's participation at Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). Not once, but twice.The response remained the same, even the words to a degree, and certainly raised quite a few eyebrows in the media room. It was Gambhir's first interaction with the media in Australia as the coach mysteriously stayed away after the pre-departure address back in November.He was back in the hot seat at a time when a lot of questions were being raised about the environment in the dressing room, knee-jerk reactions while selecting the XI and the defeat in Melbourne which came after a debatable call to benchThe No. 3 was benched to accommodate Rohit back at top of the order but it didn't work out as the Indian captain's lean patch continued and India were outplayed in the Boxing Day Test.Gambhir was constantly asked about the transition, discussions with senior players and he maintained that ""Indian cricket is in safe hands"" while emphasising the importance of ""honesty"".There was a lot of straight talk during the interaction which lasted a little over ten minutes but it was the sequence of events which followed that added to intrigue of India's last practice session of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .Moments after finishing the presser, Gambhir engaged in a long conversation with Jasprit Bumrah near the change room as the rest of the lot played foot-volley. Once the warm-up was complete, the head coach made his way to the ground and had a chat with Shubman Gill, who was doing fielding drills at that time with coach T Dilip and Washington Sundar. A short chat was followed by a fist pump, pat on the back and soon Bumrah joined and gave Gill a handshake.The youngster, who was dropped for the Boxing Day Test, continued with more close-in catching drills as the likes of Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, KL Rahul, Nitish K Reddy and Yashasvi Jaiswal did some slip-catching. All this while Rohit stood away from the group and didn't participate in the catching drills, which he was very active in before the Melbourne fixture, and was one of the last players to leave the ground as rest of the batters made their way to the nets.Kohli, KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Ravindra Jadeja got the session underway and Rohit, still in his training shorts and sweatshirt, had a long chat with Washington Sundar outside the dressing room.Sundar left and then it was Gill's turn to speak to the skipper and this time they had Bumrah for company too. When the mini-conference was over, all players were sweating it out but Rohit was nowhere to be seen.Kohli, Jaiswal, KL, Jadeja and now Gill too were swapping nets as they continued to face the likes of Sundar, Reddy, Prasidh Krishna, Harshit Rana and a lot of side-arm.The action continued before Rohit finally made an appearance and stood in a corner chatting with video analyst Hari before starting a long, light-hearted chat with Bumrah. The seamer had a ball in his hand and the two cracked plenty of jokes but Rohit didn't look in the mood to have a hit.Players started to leave the area and Rohit exited too, adding to the curiosity of the travelling media contingent. He, however, returned in a few minutes with the batting gear on and had a small hit before India wrapped up their final session of the tour.It wasn't a usual net session as Rohit remains very chatty in the middle and has never stood in a corner, away from all the action. Thursday, however, was different and felt different. Even as the public announcer practiced the names of skippers of the two teams in the main ground, Rohit gave enough hints that he wasn't going to be one for the New Year Test.

NEW DELHI: Seamer Scott Boland produced a stunning spell of 6-45 as Australia need 162 runs to win the fifth Test and reclaim the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the first time in a decade.

Their disciplined bowling ensured a swift end to India’s innings, setting the stage for a gripping series finale.Boland’s figures of 6-45 in 16.5 overs marked his first five-wicket haul in Tests since his legendary 6-7 debut against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground during the 2021 Ashes. With a 10-wicket match haul, Boland had the Sydney crowd, dressed in pink for the McGrath Foundation, roaring in delight.Ravindra Jadeja started the morning positively by slicing a short and wide delivery from Cummins for four, taking India’s lead past 150. However, two balls later, Cummins angled a fuller delivery in before getting it to seam away, inducing an edge to Alex Carey, dismissing Jadeja for 13 off 45 balls.In his next over, Cummins bowled Washington Sundar with a delivery that angled in and seamed through the gate, ending his patient knock of 12 off 43 balls.Boland then completed his six-wicket haul by having Mohammed Siraj edge to first slip and bowling Jasprit Bumrah with a delivery that clipped his leg-stump.With Bumrah’s participation as a bowler uncertain due to back spasms, Australia face the challenging task of chasing 162 on a pitch that remains difficult for batting, promising an exciting conclusion to the series.",India bowled out for 157 on Day 3 at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Due to fewer appearances for the nation due to the presence of the first-choice, more experienced pace trio of captain Pat Cummins Mitchell Starc , and Josh Hazlewood , former Australian pacer Brett Lee praised fiery pacer Scott Boland , referring to him as ""Mr Consistent"" and drawing comparisons to former Australian spinner Stuart MacGill Despite a strong start by openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul in the second innings, India lost quick wickets and finished the day at 141/6, with a 145-run lead and little batting firepower remaining. Boland continued to haunt the Indian team with his accurate line and lengths, taking four wickets.Lee discussed Boland with the media on Saturday in Sydney.""He is a freak. He is good everywhere. He is good here because the wicket suits him. Boland is Mr Consistent. His action makes him good, his consistency, his temperament. And he's under the radar. He is literally the world's nicest guy, he does not ask for the accolades, and he catches people off guard.""However, Lee believes that due to their accomplishments for the squad, the renowned Australian pace trio will always be the team's first choice.""My gut says you have to pick those three (Cummins, Starc, Hazlewood) guys every day of the week,"" he said.""They have achieved so much. Starc and Cummins are obviously playing now because they are fully fit but if Hazlewood gets his fitness back and is ready to play, unfortunately you have to go with Josh Hazlewood, and when I say unfortunately, unfortunately for Scott Boland. A fit Josh Hazlewood gets into any Test line-up, in my opinion,"" he added.Boland's predicament was likened to that of former spinner MacGill, who, in spite of his skill as a spinner, was only able to play 44 Test matches for Australia because of the presence of the renowned Shane Warne , taking 208 wickets at an average of 29.02 during his career.""It's a bit like MacGill and Warne, that is probably the best analogy I could say,"" said Lee.","Former Australian pacer Brett Lee praised fiery pacer Scott Boland.

Former Indian all-rounder Sanjay Bangar praised Rishabh Pant 's dynamic fifty against Australia in Sydney. He believes Pant's courageous performance gives India a chance to win the Test and draw the series.Pant reached his half-century in only 29 balls on day two of the fifth Test. This fifty followed a series of promising starts in four Test matches that unfortunately remained unconverted. He was eventually dismissed by Australian captain Pat Cummins . India finished the day at 141/6, leading by 145 runs.Bangar, speaking on Star Sports, commended Pant for effectively handling Mitchell Starc 's swing and Scott Boland's consistent line and length.""The kind of bravery that Rishabh Pant portrayed with his bat, that is the only reason I think that India is in a position where we are still thinking that we can win this match. If you keep this innings aside, the way he played, the calculative risks that he took, the way he played those shots, because Mitchell Starc's deliveries swing in when the ball gets a bit old so he played the shots towards the square-leg. Scott Boland who hits the length, he stepped out and played him, where there was no fielder in the point region he played those cut shots.""Bangar described Pant's innings as ""composed."" He admired Pant's adaptability, contrasting this innings with his first-innings performance of 40 runs from 98 balls, which included enduring several body blows.""So it was quite a composed innings, it was not that he came out and started playing shots without even thinking anything about it. When he plays like this, he has shown that he is quite diverse and you also expect that when a player has played 40-45 test matches, the way he played in the first innings where he took those blows on his body, sometimes you will have to play like that and you'll have to respect the conditions. And today situation of the match was such that a strategy a was put in place where he played counter-attacking innings and it is quite pleasant to watch when he plays those counter-attacking innings,"" he concluded.Pant's first-innings knock included three fours and a six. He demonstrated resilience and a willingness to absorb physical impact for the team's cause. In contrast, his second-innings approach was marked by calculated aggression and an opportunistic exploitation of scoring opportunities.Pant's performance throughout the Border-Gavaskar Trophy has been below his usual high standards. He has accumulated 255 runs in nine innings across five matches, averaging 28.33 with a strike rate of 59.02.","Former Indian all-rounder Sanjay Bangar praised Rishabh Pant's dynamic fifty against Australia in Sydney.

City turned corner?

Arsenal blew a chance to make up significant ground on Premier League leaders Liverpool on Saturday with a frustrating draw at Brighton as Manchester City pummelled West Ham 4-1.In-form Newcastle inflicted another painful defeat on Ange Postecoglou's struggling Tottenham and Chelsea's recent woes continued with a 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace.Mikel Arteta's Arsenal, Premier League runners-up over the past two seasons, travelled to the south coast hunting a fourth straight league win in the evening kick-off.Seventeen-year-old Ethan Nwaneri, in for the injured Bukayo Saka, scored a first-half goal to put them on course for a vital three points.But after being felled by an accidental headbutt from William Saliba, stand-in Seagulls captain Joao Pedro fired home from the spot in the 61st minute.The 1-1 draw means the second-placed Gunners are five points behind Liverpool, having played two games more, with Arne Slot's in-form leaders hosting crisis-hit Manchester United on Sunday.Arteta said his team had under-performed in the second half, failing to build momentum, adding that the penalty award was ""bizarre"".""We are really disappointed with the decision that leads to the goal because I have never seen something like this in my life,"" the Spaniard told the BBC.""He (Saliba) touches the ball as well.""Manchester City's win at home against West Ham means they have now won successive matches for the first time since October and Pep Guardiola will hope they are back on track after a horror run of one victory in 13 games in all competitions.The defending champions took an early lead through a Vladimir Coufal own goal and two goals from Erling Haaland put City in total command.Phil Foden made it 4-0 before Niclas Fullkrug grabbed a consolation for Julen Lopetegui's men, who suffered a 5-0 mauling by Liverpool last week.Despite their shocking run, sixth-placed City are just two points behind Chelsea, in fourth, but Guardiola said his team were still not back in the groove.""I'm very pleased for the result but you cannot ask me if the old City is back,"" he said. ""If you saw the game, we are not.""You saw many times during the years what we have done with the opponents.""In the early kick-off, Newcastle came from behind to clinch a fifth straight Premier League win and heap more misery on injury-hit Spurs.The home side went ahead in the fourth minute through Dominic Solanke.Newcastle levelled two minutes later when Anthony Gordon arrowed an effort into the bottom corner, but Postecoglou stood in disbelief on the touchline looking at referee Andrew Madley after Joelinton intercepted Lucas Bergvall's pass with his hand in the build-up.VAR deemed Joelinton's arm to be in a natural position and the contact to be accidental.In-form Alexander Isak scored what turned out to be the winner towards the end of the first period.The 2-1 victory, watched by new England manager Thomas Tuchel, leaves Newcastle in fifth spot, which may yet prove enough to secure a place in the Champions League next season.But Spurs have slumped to 12th in the table after five defeats in seven matches.Postecoglou said he was proud of his players but was the ""angriest I think I have ever been in my career"".""I think it's clear,"" said the Australian. ""Now whether people agree with me or not whether it wasn't handball or it was accidental, I'm just not interested in any of that discussion.""I know what everyone wants me to say, but all I'll say is that on any other day, on a fair and even playing ground, we would have won that game.

NEW DELHI: Barcelona's attempts to register Dani Olmo and Pau Victor for the remainder of the season have faced significant hurdles, leading to a potential departure of the players.The club took their case to Spain's High Council for Sports on Saturday after La Liga and the Spanish football federation (RFEF) denied their registration requests.The issue stems from Barcelona's financial and administrative constraints, which initially prevented the registration of Olmo and Victor beyond 2024.Despite registering Olmo last summer by utilising an injury exemption, the club lost two court cases seeking an extension of their registrations until the end of the season.In an effort to resolve the situation, Barcelona reportedly sold VIP seats at the future Camp Nou to generate funds and increase their budget, allowing for the players' registrations.However, the joint commission handling the applications denied the licenses due to RFEF rules prohibiting the registration of a player whose license has been previously cancelled within the same season.Barcelona have stated their intention to appeal the decision at the High Council for Sports. Club presidentJoan Laporta has faced criticism for his handling of the affair and has spoken with Olmo and Victor to reassure them.Notably, Olmo's contract reportedly includes a clause allowing him to leave if he cannot be registered.The absence of Olmo and Victor from Barcelona's squad for the Copa del Rey tie against Barbastro highlights the uncertainty surrounding their futures at the club.The situation stresses the complex financial and administrative challenges Barcelona are navigating as they seek to retain their star players while adhering to the regulations set forth by La Liga and the RFEF.",Barcelona's attempts to register Dani Olmo and Pau Victor for the remainder of the season have faced significant hurdles.

Barcelona 's head coach Hansi Flick expressed his discontent on Friday regarding the potential departure of crucial midfielder Dani Olmo due to the club's financial difficulties, while remaining hopeful for a positive resolution.On Tuesday, the Catalan club announced their request to the Spanish football federation for a new playing licence for Spanish international Olmo, following the expiration of his initial registration on December 31, 2024, after Barcelona had exhausted all legal options for extension.Barcelona acquired Olmo for approximately 60 million euros ($62 million) last summer. Spanish media reports suggest his contract contains a provision allowing his release if registration requirements are not met.Due to La Liga 's strict financial regulations limiting Barcelona's expenditure, the debt-laden club initially managed to register Olmo only after Andreas Christensen's injury in August.Striker Pau Victor faces a similar registration predicament.""If I am honest, I was not happy about the situation, and the players are not happy about the situation,"" Flick told a news conference Friday.""But it is like it is and we have to accept it, we are professional, we have to play football. I have to coach and the club has to do their job.""The confidence (in the club) is there, I am always positive about things, but we have to wait for the decision.""Barcelona are set to face Barbastro in the Copa del Rey round of 32 on Saturday, currently without Olmo and Victor.""My job is to prepare the team for the cup,"" continued Flick.""I was in contact before Christmas with the president and I spoke today with the president.""I have the confidence with the club that they do their job and I do my job.""Olmo, 26, a key contributor to Spain's Euro 2024 triumph, has shown excellent form since arriving from Leipzig, scoring five league goals.La Liga stated on Tuesday that ""Barcelona has presented no alternative"" that complies with league spending regulations to enable player registration.The potential loss of Olmo would significantly impact the third-placed Blaugrana's trophy aspirations this season, whilst adding to the club's series of administrative difficulties following years of financial mismanagement.","Hansi Flick expresses his discontent over Barcelona's potential departure of Dani Olmo.

Arteta stressed on Friday the importance of maintaining consistency as his team prepares for their Saturday fixture against Brighton.""We have to show the same level of consistency and a bit more, because the last year we have been the best team in the league, broken various records and still haven't won a major trophy, so something is missing,"" said the Spaniard.""It's going to be very thin, small details, you can pick up certain games and situations. But at the end, we're so close and we just have to flip that coin to the other side to make it happen. That's only going to happen if we do what we have to do and what we can control. The rest is out of our hands.""In their quest for their first Premier League title since 2004, Arsenal face a setback with Bukayo Saka 's hamstring injury, sidelining him until March following the Crystal Palace match.Regarding player rotation, Arteta stated: ""There's not one player that's going to play nine games in a row in that position, it's impossible.""He further noted: ""We need more threat, we need more players fit and rotation in that unit. In relation to that, we will make decisions and as well, players' performances, that's simple.""Regarding potential January transfers, Arteta remained noncommittal.""The focus is on the players that we have,"" he said. ""When something is in the market that we can afford and believe is going to have a real impact on the team, we have to be open to that possibility. We have the ability to change the squad in the windows, but at the moment the focus is on what we have.""",Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta stresses importance of consistency.

Richard Masters , the Premier League's chief executive, has voiced concerns about the scheduling of the Club World Cup . He believes it could pose significant challenges for Manchester City and Chelsea 's preparations for the 2025/26 Premier League season.The expanded 32-team tournament, hosted by the United States, will feature both English clubs. Players' unions are considering legal action due to welfare concerns, and national leagues are worried about the impact on their own competitions.The Club World Cup final is scheduled for July 13th, 2025, while the Premier League season kicks off on August 16th.“The leagues and the players' unions are not happy with the decisions that are being taken at a global level.”Masters expressed his concerns to Sky Sports, highlighting the tight turnaround between the two competitions.“We've seen the Club World Cup come in, and obviously that is going to have an impact on the Premier League.”He explained the potential conflict between the Club World Cup schedule and players' contractual right to a three-week break.“If either Manchester City or Chelsea get to the final of that competition, the Premier League starts four weeks later, and all players are supposed to have three weeks off as part of the contractual commitment.”Masters questioned how this scheduling clash could be resolved.“So how does that work? With great difficulty I would say.”Shifting his focus to the financial state of English football , Masters dismissed suggestions of an impending crisis. He reiterated the Premier League's concerns about the possible ramifications of an independent regulator.During the 2023/24 season, the Premier League incurred legal costs exceeding £45 million ($56 million) defending its rules against challenges from clubs.Further significant legal expenses are anticipated this season due to the ongoing disciplinary case against Manchester City.The reigning champions face over 100 alleged breaches of the Premier League's financial rules, with charges brought in 2023.An independent commission concluded its hearings between September and December, and a verdict is now awaited.Manchester City has also contested the legality of the league's associated party transaction (APT) regulations. These regulations are designed to ensure fair market value in deals involving organizations connected to a club's ownership.Both the current and previous British governments have advocated for an independent regulator. The goal is to ensure the financial stability of clubs in the top five tiers of English football.However, Masters argued that excessive regulation could stifle the excitement that fuels the Premier League's success.“We have that jeopardy, we have that constant fizz of compelling entertainment.”He attributed the Premier League's global appeal to various factors, particularly its unpredictable nature.“There are many different reasons (for the Premier League's global popularity) but that, I think, is what separates us from others.”Masters emphasized the importance of investment in maintaining the league's competitive balance.“We have always been pro investment within measured risks. The Premier League is not a pension fund, it is a place where capital is put at risk. There is no certainty of outcome -- that is one of the things that makes it interesting.”He expressed apprehension that an independent regulator might prioritize risk aversion, hindering clubs' investment capacity.“We do worry that a new regulatory function might be risk-averse and might inhibit clubs' ability to invest. And the ability to invest is key to competitive balance, and that jeopardy that I'm talking about.”",Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has voiced concerns about the scheduling of the Club World Cup.

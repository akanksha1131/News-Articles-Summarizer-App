Mike Hesson press conference: 'Ishan took the game away from us' after India beat Pakistan

Poll What was the main reason for Pakistan's loss against India? Poor batting approach Timid start Ineffective bowling Toss decision

COLOMBO: All those who don’t mind a sense of competition in an India-Pakistan game were left scratching their heads by late Sunday at the Premadasa.Pakistan have been in Sri Lanka since the start of this World Cup, and have the spinners to make use of the slow pitch conditions here. There is an X-factor bowler in Usman Tariq, who may not be Varun Chakravarthy but has taken wickets in 24 consecutive T20 games and bowls at an economy rate of 5.93 in T20Is.Still, when it came to the high-pressure India game, it was a meek surrender. It seemed that the Pakistan team had learnt nothing from their hat-trick of Asia Cup defeats and went down even before the game could take the shape of a contest.Before going into any analysis, let’s accept one thing. India are a superior side than Pakistan and for the neighbours to turn the tables, it will need an upset. But the passionate Pakistan fans are well within their rights to demand that upset once in a blue moon. Like the Indian teams from the mid-80s to the early 2000s -- they won the World Cup games, the Independence Cup in Bangladesh and one Sahara Cup in Toronto even as Pakistan dominated the subcontinental rivalry.On Sunday, for Pakistan it was a case of being timid to start with. The pitch gets slower and it would have been much easier for Pakistan to set a target and pressurize India with their spinners.But they got it wrong by choosing to field first and bringing all the pressure on their batting line-up, which is average at best. They should have understood that if it took them a humongous struggle to chase 147 against the Netherlands, they are not good enough to cross the line chasing against India, a side that would not give you a sub-160 target even on their worst batting day.“I was surprised to see Pakistan choose to field after winning the toss. That’s where they lost half the game,” spin legend R Ashwin said on his youtube show. Pakistan coach Mike Hesson, though, defended his skipper Salman Agha’s decision and felt it was Ishan Kishan’s brilliance that took the game away from them. “The pitch didn’t slow down and it spun less in the second innings. So you have to look at the facts rather than be emotional. It was the quality of the bowling in the first six overs and the way Ishan played that took the game away from us,” Hesson said.Also, hurting Pakistan cricket is the poor form of paceman Shaheen Afridi. He has been below-par with each successive game, but there’s some reason better known to the team management that he can’t be dropped. On Sunday, he bowled two crucial overs and gave away 31 which, in a low-scoring game, was huge. For India, Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya, the two pacers, bowled five overs conceding 33 and took four wickets. “Afridi cannot bowl the hard length consistently on a pitch like this. And if he was bowling to Ishan, he should have tried something different,” Ashwin said.The third aspect, is of course the Pakistan batting approach. It’s true that 175 on a slow pitch was akin to a 225 on any Indian track. Still keeping wickets towards the end would have given Pakistan a fighting chance at the back end.Former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja, on his show said that he finds it hard to fathom the approach of the Pakistani team. “They learnt nothing from their Asia Cup losses. They keep trying the slam bang approach, which cannot work for them against a team as skilled as this India. But no player is ready to take the game deep,” Rameez pointed out.But for the negatives, Pakistan can still qualify for the Super-8s with a win against Namibia on Wednesday. They will continue to play in Colombo if they go that far and the fans will hope against hope that the opposition teams will not be as lethal as India.","India beat Pakistan by eight wickets in their second ODI in Sri Lanka.

KALYANI: He might no longer be in the national team’s scheme of things. He might not be in BCCI’s central contract list. He might be 35 years old. But Mo-hammed Shami remains a potent force.Shami showed how potent he can be by claiming three wickets to help Ben-gal reduce Jammu and Kashmir to 198 for five at stumps on Day II of the Ranji Trophy semifinal match at the Bengal Cricket Academy (BCA) ground.Resuming the day at 249/5, Bengal lost five wickets for 79 runs to be bowled out for 328 runs, some 45 minutes before the lunch interval. But J&K suffered early jolts when Shami picked up two wickets to reduce the visitors to 13 for two before the lunch interval. The former India international had openers Shubham Khajuria in his second over and Yawer Hassan in his fourth and final over, both the batters were trapped in front.Left-hander Shubham Pundir, how-ever, seemed a bit unlucky to be given out after the batter’s edge looked to have kissed the ground. Veteran Paras Dogra and Abdul Samad then arrested the slide.Samad went on to get his 50 off just 36 balls. Dogra used all his experience to get to his fifty off 95 balls. Finally, Shami broke the 143-run fourth-wicket stand in the fourth delivery as he came back for his second spell. Samad departed for an 85-ball 82. Dogra followed his partner in the first ball of the next over. The J&K skipper got 58 and, in the pro-cess, also completed 10,000 runs in Ranji Trophy. Earlier, Bengal’s Sudip Gharami fell lbw for 146, Auqib Nabi ending up with five for 87.Brief scores: Bengal Ist innings 328 (S Gharami 146, A Easwaran 49, Auqib Nabi 5/87) vs J&K Ist innings 198/5 (Abdul Samad 82, Paras Dogra 58, Shami 3/60).",Shami took three wickets to help Ben-gal reduce Jammu and Kashmir to 198 for five at stumps on Day II of the Ranji Trophy semifinal match at the Bengal Cricket Academy (BCA) ground.

T20 World Cup: India humiliate Pakistan again

Sri Lanka had never chased 180 in a T20I at home. To-night, under the lights at Pallekele, Pathum Nissanka re-wrote history in spectacular fashion. The opener scripted a match-winning century, scoring 100* off 52 balls, a memorable knock laced with 10 fours and five sixes.Nissanka played a tour-de-force of an innings, ruthless yet measured. Every boundary split fields, every six cleared the ropes with authority and every calculated strike kept Lanka’s chase of 182 runs firmly on course.The World Cup co-hosts gunned down the target with eight wickets in hand and two overs to spare in front of a packed crowd. Nissan-ka’s century was a declaration of intent that will live long in memory of Sri Lankan cricket fans.With this landmark victory, Sri Lanka secured a spot in the Super 8s while Australia now teeter on the brink of elimination. Nissanka was expertly sup-ported by Kusal Mendis, with the pair putting on a 97-run second-wicket stand, and by Pavan Rathnayake, whose sensational 15-ball unbeaten 28 helped finish the chase in style.At 121/2 after 14 overs, Sri Lan-ka’s chase was on a knife edge. But Nissanka took matters into his own hands and scored 20 runs in the 15th over from Marcus Stoinis, which proved to be the turning point in the chase.Smarting from their shock loss to Zimbabwe in the previous game, Australia, put in to bat after Sri Lanka won the toss and chose to field, galloped to a wonderful start, scoring 70 off the first six overs.Travis Head blazed to a 29-ball 56 (7x4, 3x6), while captain Mitch-ell Marsh, back in charg e, matched Head shot for shot. He was particularly brutal against Sri Lanka’s spinner Maheesh Theekshana. At 110/2 in 10 overs, it felt like one-way traffic.Then came the twist. Matheesha Pathirana hobbled out with a hamstring strain and Sri Lanka could have folded. Instead, they roared. The field spread, the tempo shifted, and spin tightened the screws.Dushan Hemantha ripped through the middle with a three-wicket burst, backed by the relent-less control of Wanindu Hasaranga. Dushmantha Chameera was exceptional at the death, finishing with 2/36.OZ ON THE BRINK...Australia need to...1. Beat Oman keeping NRR in mind.2. Hope Zimbabwe lose to both Ireland and Lanka. If both come to pass, the Aussies will qualify for Super 8s on better NRR.","Sri Lanka had never chased 180 in a T20I at home. Pathum Nissanka re-wrote history in spectacular fashion.

Tom Bruce: Franchise cricket will help Associates get better,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/franchise-cricket-will-help-associates-get-better-scotlands-bruce/articleshow/128447593.cms,"Scotland's Tom Bruce plays a shot during the T20 World Cup (AP Photo)

What will Team India do today in Ahmedabad? Practice timing, Playing XI, press conference and more

Ever since the T20 World Cup was expanded to allow more teams, associate nations have run full members close and on occasions even toppled them, with the United States and Nepal giving India and England a run for their money in this edition.Scotland batter Tom Bruce said the gap between associate sides and top-tier teams could be bridged by playing more often against stronger opponents, and added that franchise cricket could help associate nations improve.“But how can we build up from there? That’s the burning question the associate members have asked over the last two weeks of the ongoing tourney. The lack of games against top-tier nations means they are never able to capilatise on that high as for the next two years they will be playing among themselves in their respective zones to qualify for the next edition besides competing in the World Cup League.”Bruce said more matches against leading teams would improve performance, while the ICC needed to chart out a framework for it. He said franchise cricket helped local players improve in countries that hosted such tournaments.“If you see the countries who have franchise tournaments, the local players are getting so much better. It’s only natural that’s going to happen when you surround yourself with the best players,” said the 34-year-old who played 20 T20Is and two ODIs for New Zealand before switching to Scotland last year.He cited Nepal, Scotland’s opponents in their last Group C match at the Wankhede Stadium on Tuesday, saying the presence of overseas players in the Nepal Premier League could help Nepal’s players in the long run. He referred to players including Faf du Plessis, Dawid Malan, Martin Guptill, Wayne Parnell and Sohail Tanvir featuring in the league.Other associate nations with a T20 league are USA (Major League Cricket), Canada (Global T20 Canada) and UAE (ILT20), while the European T20 League was set to begin this year.Scotland entered the tournament after a last-minute invite when Bangladesh pulled out, and they looked to put up a fighting display as they did in previous editions. In 2021, they beat Bangladesh to reach the Super Six stage. In 2022, they toppled West Indies, and in the last edition, they narrowly missed qualification from their group on net run rate.Scotland fell short after showing promise in key matches. Against West Indies in their opening match, they were 115/3 while chasing 183 but lost seven wickets for 32 runs, including four wickets in a Romario Shepherd over, and lost by 35 runs. They then defeated Italy by 73 runs before losing to England. Against England, Scotland were 113/3 in 12.3 overs but lost seven wickets for 39 runs and were bowled out for 152, which England chased with five wickets in hand.“The guys were disappointed that we weren't able to capitalise after getting ourselves into good positions. But at the same time, very positive knowing that despite limited preparation, we were in positions to win against England and the West Indies,” said Bruce who scored a 28-ball 35 against the Windies and 18-ball 24 against England.",Scotland batter Tom Bruce said the gap between associate sides and top-tier teams could be bridged by playing more often against stronger opponents.

SCOREBOARD

In a world dominated by right-handers, left-handers bring a certain novelty and freshness. Karnataka , a side historically associated with classical right-handed greats, showcased the beauty of the southpaw on Monday as three left-handers — Devdutt Padikkal, R Smaran and Kruthik Krishna — dictated terms at the Ekana Cricket Stadium.Led by skipper Padikkal’s maiden double century (232; 330b; 29x4, 3x6) and Smaran’s sublime unbeaten 121 (191b; 11x4), Karnataka piled up a mammoth 689 against Uttarakhand, tightening their grip on the Ranji Trophy semifinal. Resuming at an imposing 355/2, the eight-time champions added another 344 runs on Day 2, losing four wickets in the process and leaving the opposition chasing leather for most of the day.Padikkal, who had ended the opening day on an unbeaten 148, wasted little time in asserting control. He added a brisk 52 off as many deliveries in the morning session, effortlessly moving past his previous career-best of 193 against Punjab in Hubballi in Jan 2024. His strokeplay blended authority with elegance — crisp drives through cover and controlled flicks.At the other end, Karun Nair (60), looking poised for a century, fell against the run of play. Attempting to guide a back-of-a-length delivery from Abhay Negi, he nicked behind to wicketkeeper Saurabh Rawat, ending a valuable 129-run stand.The dismissal brought Karnataka’s leading run-getter this season, Smaran, to the crease. What followed was arguably the most pleasing passage of the innings. With two left-handers at the crease, the rhythm of Karnataka’s batting was in symmetry. Smaran was the calmer presence, rotating strike effortlessly and punishing anything loose, while Padikkal continued to unfurl his strokes with confidence.Padikkal reached his double century in 288 deliveries. It was a landmark innings marked by composure and command. Yet, in an anti-climax, he fell soon after. Attempting to put away 17-year-old Lakshya Raichandani through fine leg, he edged to the keeper, handing the youngster his maiden first-class wicket.Shreyas Gopal followed without scoring, bowled by Aditya Rawat, offering Uttarakhand a brief window of respite.But Smaran ensured there would be no shift in momentum. Alongside wicketkeeper-batter Kruthik (60), he added 118 runs in a partnership as contrasting as chalk and cheese. Kruthik’s approach was audacious, often lofting deliveries and living dangerously. Smaran, in contrast, relied on timing and placement, dissecting the field with precision and calmness.Just before tea, Kruthik’s attempted defence against Avneesh Sudha played on to his stumps. Yet the day firmly belonged to Karnataka.Smaran, in the company of Vidhyadhar Patil (35 batting), brought up his fifth first-class century in just 150 deliveries — a composed and mature innings that underlined his growing stature. The pair saw out the day without further damage.By stumps, on a surface offering little assistance, Karnataka’s left-handed artistry left Uttarakhand overwhelmed by the relentless run surge.Karnataka (I innings; o/n 355/2): Devdutt Padikkal c S Rawat b Raichandani 232, Karun Nair c S Rawat b Negi 60, R Smaran (batting) 121, Shreyas Gopal b A Rawat 0, Kruthik Krishna b Sudha 60, Vidhyadhar Patil (batting) 35.

Kolkata: Some wobbles, some worries and in the end Mohun Bagan Super Giant got just what the doctor ordered — a 2-0 win over Kerala Blasters to start their defence of the ISL title here on Saturday.Jamie Maclaren put Sergio Lobera’s side in front in the 36th minute and Tom Aldred came off the bench to head home the second goal to polish the victory up deep into injury time.However, it was not the kind of rise-and-shine moment the 30,000-odd fans present at the stands would love to be thrilled with.The defending champions’ path to victory was strewn with some avoidable potholes here and there, something which one might be tempted to attribute to their opening match rustiness and ineptitude.It was Petratos who had a direct role in breaking the deadlock. The Bagan No. 9, receiving the ball inside the box from Apuia, laid it off quickly for fellow Australian Maclaren, who steered clear of Aiban Dohling’s challenge with a sharp turn to beat the goalkeeper Sachin Suresh with a left-footed low volley. Bagan thereafter had more possession and more territory, but they couldn’t control the opponents, who looked more ambitious in the second half, especially with the arrival of Kevin Yoke.Sensing the problem, Lobera introduced Aldred in the 81st minute, taking off Petratos. Defender Aldred calmed the nerves for his team, rising to the occasion to meet Anirush Thapa’s free-kick and beating the Blasters goalkeeper for the second time. It also ensured a perfect start to the Lobera reign at the club as the Spaniard has now kept the record of a winning debut in the ISL for all four clubs he has managed so far.",Mohun Bagan Super Giant beat Kerala Blasters 2-0 in ISL opener.

KOLKATA: Defending champions Mohun Bagan Super Giant started Indian Super League 2025-26 with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Kerala Blasters FC in the season opener here at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharathi Krirangan (VYBK).A first-half strike from Jamie Maclaren (36') and a second-half injury-time goal from Tom Aldred (90+6') secured three points for the Mariners.Mohun Bagan SG head coach Sergio Lobera named a very strong lineup with all the familiar faces including Dimi Petratos, Jamie Maclaren and Alberto Rodriguez, taking the field for the Spaniard's first match in charge of the Mariners. New signings Mehtab Singh, Robson Da Silva, and Amey Ranawade were the fresh faces in the whole match day squad. On the other hand, David Catala named a young lineup in his first ISL match, with foreign signings Oumar Ba and Victor Bertomeu making their debuts alongside midfielders Y Ebindas and Rowllin Borges, as per an ISL press release.The defending champions had the better possession in the first half, with Anirudh Thapa and Lalengmawia Ralte (Apuia) controlling the midfield, allowing Robson and Liston Colaco to find space to attack through the wings.Dimi Petratos returned to his preferred No. 10 role behind Jamie Maclaren, and the Australian almost gave his side an early lead. Liston Colaco found Petratos inside the box, but the forward snatched his shot, which went wide of the goal.The Mariners were dominating possession, but were finding it difficult to break down the stubborn defence of Kerala Blasters. They did manage to take the lead after the water break through Jamie Maclaren. He was found inside the box by Petratos, and the Aussie striker turned Aiban Dohling and found the net through a composed left-footed finish for the first goal of the ISL season. Mohun Bagan ended the first half with the one goal lead registering ten shots on goal with six on target at the end of the half.Catala made two changes in the start of the second half, bringing in Naocha Singh and Marlon Trujillo while Subhasish Bose was replaced by Amey Ranawade for Mohun Bagan. The second half also saw the Mariners being comfortable with the ball, maintaining possession for long periods to force the Blasters to defend deep in their own half.Kerala Blasters became stronger in the final quarter of the game, especially with the introduction of Kevin Yoke, who showed his pace and dribbling abilities down the wings, but could not muster any clear-cut chances to trouble Vishal Kaith in goal. Mohun Bagan put the game beyond the reach of the opposition in injury-time of the second half with substitute Tom Aldred finding the goal with a powerful header past Sachin Suresh from the free-kick of Anirudh Thapa.Jamie Maclaren was named Player of the Match.",Defending champions Mohun Bagan Super Giant started Indian Super League 2025-26 with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Kerala Blasters FC.

Hours before the truncated Indian Super League (ISL) season gets underway on Saturday, it became official that FanCode had sub-licensed the linear TV rights to Sony Pictures Network India (SPNI). Under the agreement, as reported by TimesofIndia.com , Sony Sports Network will hold exclusive TV broadcast rights for India and non-exclusive rights for Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The position on international broadcast, however, is still in the works.All 91-matches will be telecast on Sony Ten 2 and pushed to other channels too if there is a double header at the same time.This is not the first time Sony Sports Network and FanCode will work together. Both platforms carried tennis' French Open in 2025 with Sony retaining the primary broadcast and sub-licensing the streaming aspect of all courts to Dream Sports-owned FanCode.Last year, a similar ploy was employed between Sony Sports and JioHotstar for cricket's India tour of England. Under those terms, Sony kept the television broadcast rights while JioHotstar was responsible for the digital streaming.""The macro observation on this is (that) there's so much opportunity (in the sports industry). (It) is so large that honestly there's just so much to be done in the industry that collaboration is probably more apt at this moment than competition because there's so much opportunity,"" explained FanCode co-founder Yannick Colaco of the sub-licensing strategy""And the way we look at it is very clear. We are a digital-first platform. So the two things that are unique about Fancode is (that) we are digital first and we are sports only.""Our product, our approach has always been focused on technology, focused on experience, focused on how we are available across 11 operating systems, focused on innovation on the digital side. And we neither have, nor (a) desire, to have any focus on building a linear TV business.""So when you look at those two unique pieces, there is tremendous opportunity to collaborate with other large media companies, which have a much bigger mandate and ambit. Very politely, we are a much smaller player in this overall media landscape.""And I think that's the way we look at it in the sense that while younger audiences are all digital first, and even some of the older audiences are migrating to digital, there is still a large audience which consumes sports content on linear television.""So when we're working with partners like the AIFF (All India Football Federation) and the ISL, we're very conscious of the fact that to help the sport grow, help the event be successful, give it maximum amount of distribution, we need to be collaborating with partners who have the linear TV presence so that we are able to reach out and basically able to reach out to all sports fans and all ISL fans across the country,"" he continued.Less than two weeks ago, FanCode acquired the broadcast rights -- linear TV and digital -- for the ISL at Rs 8.62 crore. Even though the company has presence only in digital streaming space, it consciously bid for both aspects knowing there were few, if any, players interested in just the linear TV rights.During conversations between FanCode, AIFF and the ISL interim committee, the provider made it clear they wanted to help ensure the top-division football was showcased to as many viewers as possible.After officially bagging the rights, the company entered into conversations with multiple national providers and even some regional ones.""We immediately started speaking to a bunch of people about this, including regional broadcasters, and we took a bunch of proposals that we got, we put them all together. We shared them with the AIFF and the interim committee. We got on a call with them. I shared the pros and cons of each one with them. And on that basis, a decision was made to accept Sony's proposal,"" said Colaco.While that was happening, FanCode also spoke to ISL club representatives to understand their expectations on how to improve the product. It was at this stage that the concept of each club's 'superfan' recording visuals behind the scenes came into being.ISL will have commentary in English, Hindi, Malayalam, Bengali and Tamil (only for Chennaiyin matches).Doing all this, why give away market share to a competitor like Sony Sports?""I'm making it easier for people who prefer to watch the game on linear television to watch it. And yes, (if it comes) at the cost of us also, that's okay. I think it's important to think consumer first. So I believe that eventually our product is what will give users the choice and deliver a great experience. And if it's good enough, which I hope it is, and I believe it is, consumers will come,"" reasoned Colaco.""I don't think it should be forced and that's always what we (have) believed. And I also think that you know a partner like Sony will help in raising the promotion levels and contribute (to the) marketing. (As the saying goes) A rising tide lifts all boats,"" he added.On their part, Sony Sports Network, who had attended the pre-bid conference for the broadcast rights but chose not to make a final bid, sees this as an opportunity to add to their football portfolio which is largely led by European competitions.""While we were keen to add ISL to our sports portfolio, back then, we needed more time to evaluate the property before putting in our financial offer,"" said Rajesh Kaul, Chief Revenue Officer and Business Head - Sports and International, SPNI,Yet this won't be their first foray into Indian football having previously showcased the I-League and Durand Cup.""Our aim is to cater to football fans and expand the football ecosystem in India. Sony Pictures Networks India is the Home of Football in India and we have a diverse and expansive portfolio of both International and Indian football properties that includes UEFA EURO 2028, the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Nations League, Bundesliga, FA Cup along with India’s very own legacy tournament Durand Cup. Last year, we were also the official broadcasters of I-League which is also homegrown football league,"" he stated.","FanCode sub-licensed the linear TV rights to Sony Pictures Network India. Sony Sports Network will hold exclusive TV broadcast rights for India and non- exclusive rights for Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

Kolkata: The wait is over. The Indian football season is finally here but not, perhaps, at a time ideal enough to fall head over heels with it, especially after the way the game has been left gasping in search of clarity, continuity and identity. As Mohun Bagan SG begin their title defence of an abridged version of the Indian Super League against Kerala Blasters here on Saturday, Indian football is facing a strange transition.True, every transition has its own turbulence, but this season seems to be more about unshackling a state of sterility than setting in motion a long haul.Change, though, remains the popular catchword — both as a contradictory and complementary force. For the first time since the league’s inception in 2014, it’s now in the hands of the national federation.But in this change of guard, issues remain and unintended consequences threaten to emerge with the end of the Master Rights Agreement between the AIFF and Reliance-owned Football Sports Development Limited.How the entire ISL ecosystem has bled in this period of uncertainty is there for everyone to see, and shudder.Holders Mohun Bagan are beginning a new life replacing last season’s ISL Shield and Cup-winning coach Jose Molina with another successful and veteran Spaniard Sergio Lobera.“Pressure? Yes, there’s pressure. I think if you don’t feel pressure, it means you don’t need to fight for big targets. I know I am in a winning team, in a champion’s team. I know what is my responsibility and I am very excited about this responsibility,” Lobera remarked during his match-eve media interaction on Friday.Lobera has reasons to be optimistic as the might of Mohun Bagan looks too formidable to be rooted out easily. Because even in this period of chaos and uncertainty, they have the luxury of assembling the players and training for the past couple of months.Kerala Blasters, on the other hand, represent everything about the detrimental effect of this confusing and trying time. They had to part company with their entire force of foreigners including the veterans like Noah Sadoui, Jesus Jimenez and Adrian Luna and new coach David Catala has a job on his hands with the arrival of a new quintet of overseas players with no experience of playing in Indian conditions.‘We have come here with just 14 days of preparation and it’s not enough,” Catala said.“We’re up against a team which has been training all this time when we didn’t know what would happen to us. It is true that we are going to be the underdog team, but in football anything can happen,” the Blasters coach added.Constrained by financial instability, the state of play has seen several clubs go the Blasters’ way, with FC Goa’s David Timor, Iker Guarrotxena and Borja Herrera, Mumbai City FC’s Tiri and Bengaluru FC’s Edgar Mendez being some familiar faces bidding forced goodbyes to Indian football while Durand Cup champions North-East United FC have loaned out Alaeddine Ajaraie — the best player of the ISL’s 2024-2025 season — to Persija Jakarta in the Indonesian league.","Mohun Bagan SG begin their title defence of an abridged version of the Indian Super League against Kerala Blasters here on Saturday.

“Why don’t you write something positive?” said an irate Indian football official to this reporter. It was the plea of a frustrated representative who had done plenty at the grassroots level but was trying to please multiple stakeholders in the administrative chaos that is Indian football.Picture this. Only two days before the Indian Super League , the country’s top football division, was set to get underway on February 14, members of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) Executive Committee were voting on whether to keep it a 14-team league or expand it to 15 by including Churchill Brothers.That plea from Churchill Brothers was unanimously rejected, keeping Inter Kashi in the top division after a legal quagmire that remains unresolved. The league will therefore remain a 14-team competition with a single round-robin format, featuring 91 matches across the 2025–26 season.Yes, the 2025–26 season is finally getting underway in February 2026, five months later than originally planned. The February 14 start date was reached only after the intervention of the Sports Ministry, which wanted the delay to not affect the country’s ambitious bid to host the 2036 Olympics.All this transpired because Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), the Reliance-backed company that launched and ran the ISL since 2014, saw its Master Rights Agreement (MRA) with the AIFF end in December 2025.The AIFF, stalled by court visits and constitutional updates, neither contemplated its options leading up to this deadline nor moved to renew the association.In the interim, uncertainty prevailed over if, or when, the season would get underway. While administrators twiddled their thumbs, foreign players departed to keep their careers going. Clubs were forced to let them go to recover some costs and to respect the players’ wishes.When the season finally received a start date, organisers struggled to get stadiums in playable condition. Odisha FC will only begin training for the new season on February 17 and, with no home venue confirmed, their opening fixture against Punjab FC on February 16 has been postponed. Kerala Blasters, who at one point considered shutting shop, had no clarity on which city they could feasibly play in.After extensive back-and-forth, the AIFF readied an interim fixture list, which was officially announced just a week before the league’s start. With FanCode on board as the digital broadcaster, the linear television announcement with Sony Sports Network will only take place on the day the season begins.Now for the positives amid the gloom. All stakeholders, including clubs, players, fans, sponsors and even the AIFF, deserve credit for ensuring the season was not lost. They showed maturity for the greater good.Most players have agreed to take pay cuts to keep the ball rolling, quite literally. The same applies to club owners and CEOs who have agreed to invest in a truncated season, aware that revenues will not match previous years, but have returned for the greater good.Even the AIFF, which has faced heavy criticism and could serve as a case study in administrative mismanagement, can argue that its hands were tied by legal disputes and warring factions. The fact that it eventually managed, through multiple mediators, to get everyone moving in the same direction is commendable.Unsurprisingly, the drama and court visits may not be over. As the AIFF circulated the League Rules on the eve of the season’s start, it made clear that relegation will be implemented as per the latest Constitution.This comes barely two weeks after clubs wrote to the Sports Ministry seeking Force Majeure for the season, effectively requesting a pause on relegation.Subsequently, the club that goes down could take the legal route later if the issue is not addressed for now.FC Goa, Mohun Bagan Super Giant, Odisha FC, East Bengal, Jamshedpur FC, SC Delhi, Punjab FC, Mumbai City FC, Bengaluru FC, Kerala Blasters, Inter Kashi, Mohammedan SC, NorthEast United, Chennaiyin FCMohun Bagan Super Giant vs Kerala Blasters on February 14 at 5 pmFC Goa vs Inter Kashi on February 14 at 7:30 pmRs 1.25 croreRs 75 lakhRs 2 croreFanCodeSony Sports Network","The ISL 2025-26 season will start on Saturday.

Chelsea F.C. progressed to the fifth round of the FA Cup after a 4-0 victory over Hull City A.F.C. at the MKM Stadium. Pedro Neto scored three goals, while Estevao Willian scored one.This was a return to Hull for Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior, who has played for and managed the club before. Hull City sacked him in 2024 after they failed to make the Championship play-offs.Despite the bitter end to his spell at Hull, the 41-year-old manager has stated that it is ""an amazing thing"" to be back in Humberside and that he took full advantage of the opportunity to prove to his former club what they had missed out on.""This club means a lot not just to me but also my family for many reasons,"" Rosenior said.""I do hope they make the Premier League this year, but because of our attitude and application, that is what gave us the platform to win tonight.""Rosenior has won eight of his first 11 matches since joining Chelsea from Strasbourg in January to replace Enzo Maresca. He made seven changes to the team for this match. Cole Palmer, Enzo Fernandez and Joao Pedro were not included.""Pedro Neto has been outstanding, he works so hard and has so much quality. I'm delighted to see him get the goals,"" Rosenior said.""The most pleasing aspect was the mentality. It was a really strong performance in terms of the mental application you need to be successful. Everyone worked really hard for each other.""Chelsea dominated possession in the first half and scored in the 40th minute. Liam Delap assisted Neto, who scored from outside the box.Andrey Santos had a header saved by Dillon Phillips in the early minutes of the second half.

Puka Nacua and Charlotte Flair spark fresh questions after Daytona 500 appearance



Puka Nacua is not giving fans much of an offseason break. The Los Angeles Rams wide receiver has stayed in the spotlight long after the final whistle of his season, and lately, it has little to do with football. His name keeps popping up in unexpected places, from celebrity interactions to viral social moments, showing how quickly his profile continues to grow beyond the field.It began with a lighthearted social media flirtation aimed at Sydney Sweeney , which caught fans off guard. Not long after, he was seen in West Hollywood alongside influencer Hannah Stocking, who was previously linked to Klay Thompson. The images fueled curiosity, but they also made one thing clear. Nacua’s offseason has been anything but quiet.The latest buzz followed Nacua’s visit to the Daytona 500 on February 15. He shared moments from the event on Instagram, though not every photo came from his account. Charlotte Flair offered another angle, posting pictures of them smiling together and enjoying the race atmosphere. In one shot, the two stood close, clearly comfortable in each other’s company. Her caption read, ""Yoooo this was so fun!!""She added more images, including one where they stood arm in arm.For fans already tracking Nacua’s social life, it was enough to spark another round of speculation. The two have crossed paths before, including at the ESPY Awards, which suggests their connection did not begin in Daytona.All of it has unfolded against the backdrop of a bittersweet football reality. After the Seattle Seahawks ended the Rams’ run and later defeated the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 60, Nacua drew attention for his online reaction, including a jab at quarterback Sam Darnold. The comment did not land well with many fans, especially as Seattle celebrated.Lost in the noise is how remarkable Nacua’s season actually was. He played 16 games, pulling in 129 catches for 1,715 yards and 10 touchdowns. Those numbers reinforced his place among the league’s elite receivers and showed his rise was no fluke.Still, the offseason often reveals a different side of athletes. For Nacua, it has been a mix of public appearances, social media moments, and chance encounters that keep his name circulating. Whether it is coincidence or something more, people are watching closely. And he does not seem to be hiding from the attention.","Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua and Charlotte Flair have been spotted together. The two were seen together at the Daytona 500.

Fernando Mendoza faces questions about Raiders fit before draft decision



Fernando Mendoza made it clear this week that his NFL Draft journey will begin on his terms. The former Indiana quarterback confirmed he will attend the NFL Draft Combine in Indianapolis but will not take part in on field drills. It is a bold choice, though not a surprising one. After leading Indiana to an unbeaten Big Ten season and a national title, Mendoza has little left to prove. Most projections already have him sitting at the very top of the draft board.Fernando Mendoza enters this process as the most valuable asset in a quarterback class many scouts see as thin. The Las Vegas Raiders hold the first overall pick, and his name has been tied to them for months. His rise has been steady, powered by production, confidence, and a championship résumé that changed the trajectory of Indiana football almost overnight.The discussion around Fernando Mendoza is not really about his ability. It is about what comes next and where. During Monday’s edition of The Herd, Fox Sports analyst Colin Cowherd voiced concern, not about the quarterback, but about the environment waiting for him.“I don’t worry about Fernando Mendoza; I worry about the Raiders as his parent in this league. Bottom line, even if Klint Kubiak is a good coach, he’ll probably be the fourth-best coach in his division, and ownership is impulsive and ridiculously impatient. I don’t have a Mendoza issue; I have a Mendoza to the Raiders issue.”Cowherd added another layer to his evaluation. “Who picks you matters a lot. I think it’s an interesting red flag. Here’s the thing, Caleb (Williams) may have struggled, but Caleb is an insane athlete. Mendoza is not even an Andrew Luck athlete.”Even so, Mendoza’s production speaks loudly. He posted a PFSN College QB Impact score of 93.3 while throwing for 3,535 yards, 41 touchdowns, and just six interceptions. He also ran for 276 yards and seven more scores. Those numbers helped transform Indiana into a national champion and cemented his place at the top of this class.Not everyone believes he needs to play right away. Fox Sports draft analyst Rob Rang offered a different approach.“Unlike recent No. 1 overall selections, Mendoza does not necessarily have to start immediately,” Rang wrote. “The Raiders, of course, still have veteran Geno Smith, who, like Mendoza, is a clean schematic fit in Kubiak’s offense.”Rang added, “Smith’s presence should allow Kubiak and the Raiders the increasingly rare opportunity to truly prepare Mendoza for the NFL, rather than rush him onto the field. The Heisman Trophy winner and national champion has the prototypical build, all the intangibles, and enough physical traits to ultimately become a star in the NFL.”Mendoza’s path here was not predictable. He began at California Golden Bears before transferring to Indiana and thriving under coach Curt Cignetti. One season changed everything. Now, the next decision, made by a franchise and not a player, could shape the rest of his career.","Fernando Mendoza will attend the NFL Draft Combine in Indianapolis.

Kylie Kelce’s candid confession about past wedding discomfort involving Dwyane Wade



Kylie on Her “Feral” College Era, Beef with Dwyane Wade & Jason’s Campus Walk of Shame | Ep. 54

Kylie Kelce and Dwyane Wade elevator incident still lives in her mind, even as her family’s spotlight grows brighter by the day. With her brother in law Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift reportedly planning a Rhode Island wedding next summer, attention has drifted naturally toward love stories in the Kelce circle. Yet for Kylie, one wedding memory from her own past carries a strange mix of disbelief and humor.Long before the global buzz around Travis and Swift, Kylie was preparing to marry Jason Kelce in Philadelphia. It was supposed to be a perfect, emotional day. Instead, an elevator ride just minutes before the ceremony left her stunned. Not because of chaos or nerves. Because of silence. And the man standing quietly beside her was NBA royalty.The moment happened in 2018 at the Logan Hotel, where Kylie, dressed in full bridal attire, stepped into an elevator with her bridesmaids and wedding planner. Already overwhelmed with emotion, she suddenly realized they were sharing the small space with Dwyane Wade.“I have a long-standing beef with Dwyane Wade,” Kylie said on her Not Gonna Lie podcast, noting it’s something that the former NBA star “actually knows nothing about”.She painted the scene clearly. “I am in a wedding dress with a veil on the back of my head,” she recalled. “We have all four bridesmaids and the wedding planner, Sarah, in the elevator with us.

"NFL Mock Draft 2026: Cowboys, Bengals linked to bold moves in chaotic first round",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-mock-draft-2026-cowboys-bengals-linked-to-bold-moves-in-chaotic-first-round/articleshow/128441496.cms,"The 2026 NFL Draft could turn chaotic after the expected first overall pick, as a thin pool of elite prospects may trigger aggressive trades inside the top 10. Teams with multiple first-round selections could package picks to move up, while others prioritize quarterbacks, pass rushers, and protection. The uncertainty may reshape roster strategies and redefine draft value across the league.

Trade chaos and bold roster building could define the top 10

The 2026 NFL Draft is currently turning out to be one of the most unpredictable ones in recent history and the mess can start as soon as the first pick will be announced. Insiders of the league feel that there is not a rich pool of elite prospects in the class that could drive teams into aggressive trade tactics in order to get the handful of blue-chip players present. The top 10 may become a deal-making craze instead of a talent grab with a handful of franchises with multiple first-round picks.Risk vs. urgency is already being measured in front offices. The needs of quarterbacks, pass rush value, and the stability of the offensive line are also premium needs, but the small pool of the best prospects has established a seller market. Teams eager to move up must not only pay a steep price but also find partners willing to slide down the board and trust depth over star power.Most projections agree the Las Vegas Raiders will stay put at No. 1 and select Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza, widely viewed as the closest thing to a franchise cornerstone in this class. From there, volatility takes over. Defensive playmakers such as Ohio State linebacker Arvell Reese and safety Caleb Downs are expected to draw early interest from teams aiming to reshape struggling defenses.Trade scenarios could define the middle of the top 10. The Dallas Cowboys, armed with multiple first-round picks, have been linked to a potential jump up the board to secure an elite edge rusher like Texas Tech’s David Bailey.Another possible change, which may be considered by the Cincinnati Bengals, is to look provisions upwards and fill all the secondary problems, whereas the Rams of Los Angeles might bundle picks to gain position as defensive leaders within the linebacker squad.The frenzy can still be beneficial to the teams that remain. The Cleveland Browns might also need to focus on offensive line assistance to stabilize protection, whereas Washington Commanders and New Orleans Saints will be expected to focus on wide receivers to benefit young quarterbacks and developing passing offenses.The broader theme is clear. This outline might be shallow on the top, but scarcity is a frequent inspiration of daring judgments. Provided that early trades are real, it would disrupt the entire league not just in terms of the strategies of the rosters but also how the flexibility, draft capital, and immediate impact talent are prioritized by the teams.","The 2026 NFL Draft is currently turning out to be one of the most unpredictable ones in recent history.

Miami Dolphins confirmed they had released Tyreek Hill, the veteran wide receiver with immediate effect after a failed physical. At 31, Hill is still one of football’s most feared deep threats. But his recovery from a severe knee injury has now reshaped his future, and Miami’s plans, in one swift decision.Hill’s exit closes a productive chapter that began when he arrived from the Kansas City Chiefs in 2022. He gave Miami explosiveness and reliability, missing just one game in his first two seasons there. That changed last September when his knee gave way. A dislocation and torn ligaments, including the ACL, left him fighting a difficult road back. Now, before he could complete it, the team moved on.Tyreek Hill's Dolphins release came down to health, timing, and roster reality. The team officially listed his failed physical as the reason, ending his run after three seasons. Miami also cut James Daniels and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine the same day, signaling a wider reset.Hill built his reputation long before Miami. Drafted in 2016, he quickly became known as “the Cheetah,” a blur in shoulder pads.He earned eight Pro Bowl selections in his first 10 seasons and helped Kansas City win the Super Bowl in 2020. Even after his trade, he remained elite, ranking sixth in receiving yards across the league during his Miami stint.Off the field, his personal life has also drawn attention. His divorce from Keeta Vaccaro remains ongoing, shaped by accusations and public scrutiny. On the same day Miami cut Hill, Vaccaro shared a glimpse of her morning online. Her Instagram story showed her posing in pink with the caption, ""morning vlog ✨🌸"" and included a link to her Snapchat account.The timing did not go unnoticed. Hill’s football life had shifted dramatically, while Vaccaro appeared focused on her routine. It offered a quiet but striking contrast to the uncertainty surrounding one of the NFL’s fastest and most accomplished receivers.Hill’s next step is unclear. His résumé speaks loudly, but his knee will decide how much football he has left to give.","Tyreek Hill was released by the Miami Dolphins after a failed physical.

“Starting 100 days before the big day” Travis Kelce’s wedding countdown for Taylor Swift sends social media into meltdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/starting-100-days-before-the-big-day-travis-kelces-wedding-countdown-for-taylor-swift-sends-social-media-into-meltdown/articleshow/128440818.cms,"Reports suggest Travis Kelce has begun an elaborate romantic countdown ahead of his summer wedding to Taylor Swift, starting with lavish Valentine’s Day gifts and continuing with planned flower deliveries in the months leading to the ceremony. Fans are buzzing over the grand gestures, while wedding plans at Swift’s Rhode Island estate are expected to transform the venue into a floral showcase.

Travis Kelce's romantic countdown built on flowers, fashion, and symbolism

Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s relationship has always lived at the intersection of romance, spectacle, and pop-culture fascination. Now, as their highly anticipated summer wedding draws closer, fresh reports suggest the Kansas City Chiefs star is turning the months leading up to the ceremony into a grand romantic countdown.What began as a lavish Valentine’s Day celebration is reportedly evolving into a carefully planned series of gestures designed to build anticipation and deepen the emotional significance of their final months as an engaged couple.Sources close to the pair say Kelce wanted their last Valentine’s Day before marriage to feel unforgettable. He reportedly surprised Swift with luxury fashion pieces, rare watches, and thoughtful items aligned with her personal style. But insiders insist the gifts are only the opening chapter in a larger plan aimed at making the lead-up to the wedding as meaningful as the ceremony itself.“Starting 100 days before the big day — then again at 50 days, 30 days, and every day during the final month — he will have flower bouquets delivered to her,” claimed the well-placed insider.The gesture reflects Swift’s well-known love of florals. According to the same source, the deliveries will include roses in multiple colors, hydrangeas, and orchids so she feels surrounded by fragrance and beauty during the countdown.The Valentine’s surprises reportedly totaled more than $140,000 and included Louis Vuitton pieces Swift had recently admired, along with a Hermès caftan suited for upcoming warm-weather trips and their honeymoon. Kelce also selected high-end timepieces, including an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak and a Rolex 1908, signaling both his appreciation for craftsmanship and Swift’s fondness for blending masculine accents into her fashion choices.Beyond the gifts, reports suggest Swift is planning a floral transformation of her Rhode Island property, which is expected to host the ceremony. Landscaping plans alone could cost over $1 million, turning the venue into a lush, flower-filled setting.Together, the gestures paint a picture of a couple merging personal symbolism with high style. If the reports prove accurate, Kelce’s ongoing surprises may ensure the journey to the aisle becomes a story nearly as memorable as the wedding itself.","Travis Kelce's romantic countdown built on flowers, fashion, and symbolism.

“I’d love to start a family”: Chloe Kim hints at retirement timeline while building a future with Myles Garrett,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/id-love-to-start-a-family-chloe-kim-hints-at-retirement-timeline-while-building-a-future-with-myles-garrett/articleshow/128424841.cms,"Olympic snowboard star Chloe Kim continues to make history while reflecting on life beyond competition. The 25-year-old is considering retirement in the coming years and has spoken about her desire to start a family. Supported by boyfriend Myles Garrett during the Winter Olympics, Kim is balancing elite performance with long-term plans, signaling a thoughtful transition toward her future.

As Olympic glory continues, Chloe Kim plans her next chapter with Myles Garrett

Chloe Kim is still making her mark on the history of the Olympics and secretly strategizing the next step. By competing in the winter 2026 Winter Games at Milan Cortina, the American snowboard icon has achieved another milestone by becoming the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic awards in the halfpipe. She has come in second place to South Korea rising star Choi Gaon, but her performance has solidified a legacy of dominance, hardiness, and long life in a sport in which few sport personalities can remain on top of the world over prolonged periods.Away from the halfpipe, Kim’s personal life has drawn attention as well. Her relationship with Myles Garrett, the Cleveland Browns defensive standout, has become a steady source of support during the Olympic spotlight. Garrett traveled to Italy to cheer her on, and the couple spent Valentine’s Day together amid the intensity of the Games, offering a glimpse of balance between elite competition and emotional grounding.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Despite being only 25, Kim has already begun thinking seriously about life beyond competitive snowboarding. Years of training, global travel, and high-pressure performances have shaped her identity, but she is clear that the sport will not define her forever.“Chloe Kim has picked out the date she will retire from snowboarding. She won’t reveal exactly when it will be, but says she’s had it in her mind for a really long time,” Michael Rosenberg of Sports Illustrated reported.Kim has also spoken candidly about her desire to focus on family in the future. “I am 25 right now,” she said. “I’d love to start a family. My mom had me when she was young. I’d love to be a young mom. My dad’s 70 right now. There’s so much time, but also not enough time.”Her clarity extends to her decision-making process. “Once I set my mind to something, then that’s that, and that’s how it’s gonna be,” Kim declared.Even as she considers retirement, Kim remains invested in the sport’s future. She praised teenage champion Choi Gaon and expressed confidence that “the future of snowboarding is in very, very good hands.”Kim and Garrett first appeared together publicly when they posed on the red carpet for the Crunchyroll Anime Awards in May 2025. Their relationship became more definitively public in November when they shared a kiss on the sidelines before a Browns game against the Las Vegas Raiders. The moment established them as the latest high-profile pairing between an Olympic athlete and NFL player.","Chloe Kim is the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic awards in the halfpipe.

Madison Beer reflects on why she rejects the “2026 is the new 2016” trend and what shaped her outlook

Madison Beer has talked about not buying into the internet’s nostalgia wave, even as it pulls much of pop culture with it. The singer, now 26, has seen the trend that claims 2026 mirrors the carefree glow of 2016. But her reaction is calm and clear. Speaking recently while promoting her album Locket, Beer made it known she feels more at peace now than she ever did back then. The past, for her, carries memories. Not all of them are worth reliving.Her perspective comes from experience, not distance. Beer grew up in public view, her teenage years unfolding in front of millions. While fans scroll through old photos and viral moments with fondness, she remembers something more complicated. Growth, discomfort, and lessons learned early. That contrast shapes how she sees the present. And why she is choosing it.Madison Beer addressed the viral nostalgia idea directly in her conversation with Interview Magazine. “I’ve seen it,” Beer told the outlet. “I definitely feel way better in my life now than I did then.” While artists like Charlie Puth and personalities such as Hailey Bieber have embraced the throwback mood, Beer’s connection to that time feels distant.She admits there were lighter moments. “There are nostalgic moments from 2016, the music and the Snapchat filters and the Mannequin Challenge and whatever, all that stuff that I think is really funny,” she said. “But as someone who did not have the best time in my teenage years, I definitely prefer to stay in the now, honestly.”There is humor in hindsight. Beer laughed about fashion cycles, saying, “Maybe some clothes, because I feel like a lot of clothes are coming back in style that were popular then.” But her deeper reflection landed closer to home. “I probably would’ve hung out with my little brother more because, I don’t know, when we were teenagers, he used to really annoy me and now we’re best friends,” she shared. “But other than that, nothing. ”Her early rise explains a lot. At just 13, Beer’s life changed overnight when Justin Bieber shared her cover of Etta James’ “At Last.” Fame arrived before she could prepare for it. In a later interview with Elle, she spoke honestly about that period. ""But in 2012, things were different. I didn’t feel protected, and I didn’t feel like people approached judging me like they were judging a 14-year-old,"" she shared. ""It forced me to grow up really fast, and it messed me up in a lot of ways. I’ve hopefully recovered a bit by now.""That recovery is why the present matters more. Beer is not chasing an old version of herself. She is protecting the one she fought to become.","Madison Beer has talked about not buying into the internet’s nostalgia wave.

Brittany Mahomes is once again in the news following her inclusion on the 2026 Sports Illicit digital cover of the magazine, which immediately caused controversy among the NFL fan base.

Fact check: Did Cardi B make a racially insensitive comment about Offset and Stefon Diggs?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/fact-check-did-cardi-b-make-a-racially-insensitive-comment-about-offset-and-stefon-diggs/articleshow/128421344.cms,"A viral social media post claims Cardi B vowed to stop dating and made offensive remarks about Offset and Stefon Diggs. The quote spread quickly, sparking outrage and debate online. However, no verified interview, livestream, or official post supports the statement. With no credible sources confirming it, the quote appears fabricated, highlighting how quickly misinformation about celebrities can spread online.

Did Cardi B really say she’s done dating? Viral post lacks credibility

One of these viral posts on social media is creating controversy because it alleged that Cardi B promised to never date again and talked candidly about previous relationships. The content, one of the posts published by a commentary account, went viral and elicited both enthusiastic and furious responses among both supporters and opponents. Nonetheless, Cardi B did not claim to have made the statement circulating over the internet, and the quote seems to have been fabricated.The rumor spread due to mentioning high profile individuals, in relation to her past and speculation surrounding her personal life by people. The post went viral and people believed it to be true but some others doubting its truthfulness pretended to be careful before spreading false information.The post shows the following statement to the Grammy-winning rapper: “I will be shifting my focus away from dating from now on and won’t be played, especially by Black guys like Offset and Stefon Diggs but they have good d**k”The quote has not been featured anywhere in an authenticated interview, livestream, or official social media account of Cardi B. The remark has not been given by any reputable media. The absence of sourcing goes a long way to refute the statement.Cardi B has already faced a lot of public attention, especially in connection with her relationship with Offset and the scandals of her connection to NFL star Stefon Diggs. Their names can be on the list of trending names along with her, and the fabricated claims are more believable to readers who pass through the feeds at a fast rate.Rumors about a possible split between Stefon Diggs and Cardi B intensified after the New England Patriots wide receiver posted a series of cryptic messages on Instagram days after the team’s 29–13 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in the 2026 Super Bowl. On Feb. 11, Diggs shared a 20-slide carousel featuring game photos, motivational quotes, and reflective messages, while also disabling comments on the post.Among the slides were phrases such as “Luck didn't bring me this far... God did” and reminders about gratitude, doubt, and perseverance. One quote suggested that appreciating something sometimes requires time apart, while another clip featured a child saying life is neither all good nor all bad. He closed the post with the Patriots’ motto: “We all we got, we all we need.”The timing raised eyebrows because breakup speculation surfaced the day after the Super Bowl, when fans noticed the couple appeared to unfollow each other on Instagram. The pair, first linked in 2024 and public in 2025, welcomed their first child together in November 2025 and frequently supported each other publicly.Neither Diggs nor Cardi B has confirmed a breakup, leaving fans to interpret the signals on their own.","A viral social media post claims Cardi B vowed to stop dating and made offensive remarks about Offset and Stefon Diggs.

Stefon Diggs and Cardi B’s relationship has constantly raised eyebrows over the last one year that they were together.While they welcomed a baby together in November, Stefon Diggs was also constantly accused of cheating on Cardi B as he had other kids with his ex girlfriends. Amid their controversial break up, DJ Akademiks has now brutally trolled Cardi B.A few hours ago, DJ Akademiks on his popular YouTube channel, “King Akademiks” commented on how Cardi B accepted Stefon Diggs having children with multiple women in the same year.DJ Akademiks said, “Cardi B is the only woman in US history that stayed with her man while he had six kids on her in the same year. So that's like a Guinness World Book of Records. I love Cardi, but godd*mn.”DJ Akademiks added, “Let me tell you this, a chick let me have six kids on her in the same year?

Fans quickly pushed back, citing Swift’s historic music achievements and Kelce’s Super Bowl legacy and media presence. Others defended Alwyn’s steady acting career. The debate highlights how modern fandom measures success through fame, numbers, and cultural impact.

Fans erupt after viral claim Joe Alwyn is “more successful” than Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce

A single viral post has reignited an oddly persistent online debate: success, relevance, and what those words really mean in the age of fandom warfare. The conversation exploded after a screenshot of an X post circulated widely, mocking the idea that actor Joe Alwyn could be considered “more successful” than global pop icon Taylor Swift and NFL superstar Travis Kelce . Within hours, fans from multiple camps were clashing over metrics, careers, and what counts as real achievement.The post that triggered the backlash read: ""the concept of joe alwyn (4M) being more successful and employed than taylor swift (1.6B + 4 aotys + 4 rings) and travis kelce (90M + 3 rings) 😭"". A second line amplified the jab with: ""more employed & successful than #them"".While intended as sarcasm, the message sparked fierce reactions, revealing how deeply online audiences invest in celebrity narratives and perceived status hierarchies.Supporters of Swift quickly pointed to her record-breaking tours, historic Grammy wins, and billion-dollar cultural footprint.Kelce fans were equally vocal.They emphasized his three Super Bowl titles, All-Pro output, and the fact that he is one of the greatest tight ends in the history of the NFL game. His performance in the postseason is by itself what has made him a legend as a player of pressure situations.Kelce has also gone beyond the gridiron to launch his brand into mainstream entertainment. He has audiences in the millions thanks to his popular podcast with brother Jason Kelce and being an endorser as well as appearing on television which has made him a crossover star.His relationship with Swift has further amplified his global visibility, introducing him to new audiences far beyond traditional football fans.One fan asked, “isn’t taylor’s ring estimated to cost 5M?” prompting another user to quip that “even her cats can buy him.” Others speculated about who “them” referred to, with one reply wondering if it meant “tayvis or swifties,” while another answered, “its def first option.”The mockery continued as someone laughed at the styling account itself, writing, “‘Styled’?! Hahahahaha whew hahahahaha.” Another wrote, “He has never lived up to the ""potential"" we keep hearing about. His career has stalled and he is nothing but a glorified background actor leeching off the success of others.”In the end, the debate says less about Joe Alwyn, Taylor Swift, or Travis Kelce and more about how modern fandom defines victory. In a digital era driven by visibility, success has become both quantifiable and deeply subjective.That tension keeps the conversation alive and endlessly clickable.","A viral social media post sparked outrage after sarcastically suggesting Joe Alwyn is more successful than Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce.

You get the details…”The Kansas City Chiefs’ star player, Travis Kelce, also recollected that as he attended the 2026 NFL Honors without Taylor Swift, he had to keep a lot of things in mind.Travis Kelce added, “The whole time I’m saying hi to all these familiar faces and some friends of Taylor… and I’m just like, ‘All right, got to remember saw that person…’”The star player continued, “I’m like throwing them in like my memory bank [thinking] ‘Don’t forget, cause she’s going to want some details ’cause she didn’t get a chance to go.’”At this point in time, while Travis Kelce seems to be enjoying the off season, there are strong speculations about him announcing his retirement next month when his current contract with the team ends.As per reports, insiders have revealed that there might be a slight delay in Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s high profile wedding due to the things happening in their lives.However, both Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have not confirmed any of these speculations as they try to keep their wedding planning process out of the spotlight.While Travis Kelce has yet to make a decision about his career, Taylor Swift might just be called to court because of her alleged involvement in Blake Lively’s legal drama with her co-star Justin Baldoni.","Travis Kelce reveals what Taylor Swift has taught him well ever since they began dating two years ago.

John Cena’s old words about Nikki Bella spark outrage amid her rumored romance with Cooper DeJean



What’s happening between Nikki Bella and Cooper DeJean even though there is a huge age gap between the two?



Nikki Bella, the WWE Hall of Famer, and the Philadelphia Eagles’ young player, Cooper DeJean, have sparked romance rumors over the last few months.While there are strong speculations of a relationship between the two, both Nikki Bella and Cooper DeJean continue to be private about it. Amid this, Nikki Bella’s ex and legend John Cena’s words have resurfaced and sparked chaos.A few hours ago, an old clip of John Cena appearing on The Today Show after ending things with Nikki Bella in 2018 have sparked outrage.In the clip, John Cena says, ""For anyone out there speculating on what I'm doing with my life now, I still love Nicole. I would still love to marry Nicole. I still would love to have a family with Nicole.""But this has sparked outrage among fans as many have dragged in an alleged NDA that Nikki Bella had signed during their high profile relationship.A fan by the username @Jessica_Ruiz_1 wrote, “Right and that nda, said she couldn’t even say his name, she had to say my ex, she couldn’t even say his name in her book. Like he can’t have one negative thing out there about him…”Another fan by the username @ChartsUzi posted, “Nikki escaped him and the way she only talks positive about john shows how mature she is…”A third fan by the username @carolinagky wrote, “She begged him for years to have kids and when she finally left, he suddenly had a change at heart.Men like this are a joke and shouldn't be taken seriously, always playing victim.”However, neither John Cena nor Nikki Bella has commented on the outrage yet as Cooper DeJean maintains his distance from it.For the unversed, over the last few weeks, Nikki Bella and Cooper DeJean have often been spotted together.Things took a turn on “Monday Night RAW” when fans teased Nikki Bella by yelling “Coop”, and she gave a cheeky response about Cooper DeJean.While many believed this was a confirmation about their romance, Nikki Bella later revealed to TMZ Sports that she is “single”.","John Cena’s old words about Nikki Bella spark outrage amid her rumored romance with Cooper DeJean.

The Los Angeles Lakers guard, representing Team World, recently said he feels well enough to play “a little bit” in the event at Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California.He missed time before the break but avoided a long-term setback. His status adds interest to an All-Star Game that is introducing a new format this season. Even with restricted minutes, Doncic remains one of the most watched players on the court.This year’s All-Star Game replaces the traditional setup with a round-robin tournament featuring Team USA Stars, USA Stripes, and Team World. The games will take place on February 16, starting at 5 p.m. ET, with four contests scheduled for 12 minutes each.Doncic’s participation stands out because of his recent move to the Lakers and his scoring ability. While he is not expected to handle a full workload, he could still provide short offensive bursts.Doncic strained his left hamstring earlier in February and missed the Lakers’ final four games before the All-Star break. He went through warmups during that stretch but did not play so he could focus on recovery.A strong workout on February 13 helped clear him for the All-Star Game, though his role is expected to be controlled. Doncic joked that fans should not expect him to dunk on LeBron James, suggesting he will avoid unnecessary risk.Team World will be coached by Darko Rajaković and features several established international players. The roster does not include inactive or traded players, but Giannis Antetokounmpo and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander have both been ruled out with injuries.Team World will face USA Stars, a younger group that includes Cade Cunningham and Scottie Barnes. The winner moves on to play USA Stripes, led by veterans such as LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Kawhi Leonard.That format could place Doncic on the floor against his Lakers teammate.

Angel Reese on choosing Reebok and expanding her brand

after the release of her first signature basketball shoe, making it clear that Reebok sees her as central to its return to the sport. As president of Reebok Basketball, O’Neal said Reese reflects the direction the company wants to take as it rebuilds its presence in the market.The launch comes at a time when women’s basketball is drawing more commercial attention. Reese’s sellout and expanding partnerships show her influence is growing off the court as well, strengthening her position as one of the league’s most marketable players while supporting Reebok’s long-term plan.The “Angel Reese 1” released in three colorways on February 13, 2026, and sold out across major retailers in less than a day. The response backed Reebok’s decision to build its basketball strategy around her visibility and appeal.The shoe combines performance features with elements tied to Reese’s personal style, including references to her time with the Chicago Sky. Reebok CEO Todd Krinsky called her their “top pick,” saying she represents the swagger the company wants to bring back.O’Neal and vice president Allen Iverson selected Reese as the brand’s first major signee in October 2023. Explaining the move, O’Neal said, “Angel represents everything this new era of Reebok basketball is about - power, confidence, and impact on and off the court. She’s a competitor, a leader, and she’s unapologetically herself.”He added, “She’s the face of what’s next,” placing her at the center of the company’s relaunch.Reese was involved throughout the process. Before signing, she visited Reebok headquarters, met with executives, and contributed to product design. That involvement helped move the partnership from apparel tests in 2024 to a signature shoe in 2026.Reese decided to lead Reebok’s rebuild instead of signing with Nike or Adidas, relying in part on her LSU connection with O’Neal and the opportunity for a larger role. After agreeing to the deal, she worked with Portia Blunt’s team on product development and helped launch the “Reebok by Angel” line in August 2024.Her multiyear extension makes her only the second WNBA player with a Reebok signature shoe. The immediate sellout showed strong demand and placed her in a small group of players with proven retail pull.Reese explained her decision by saying, “I chose Reebok… I wanted to be that [face].”Also read: Chris Paul’s all-time ranking: Does the veteran point guard land in the top 5 after his 2026 retirement?

Early Outlook for this Mock Trade

Theare reportedly exploring a trade that would bringto the team. The move is being discussed as a way to strengthen the roster around Victor Wembanyama and support a push toward playoff contention in the 2025-26 season.San Antonio has stayed competitive in the Western Conference, while Dallas has fallen to 19-34. With both teams heading in different directions, a deal could address immediate needs for each side. The Spurs would add outside shooting and experience, and the Mavericks could create salary flexibility while reshaping the roster.The San Antonio Spurs are built around Victor Wembanyama and a young group that includes Devin Vassell, Stephon Castle, Keldon Johnson, and Julian Champagnie. Veterans Harrison Barnes, Kelly Olynyk, and Luke Kornet are on expiring contracts, giving the front office options if it chooses to make a move.Dallas Mavericks have used Klay Thompson mostly off the bench alongside Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, P.J. Washington, Cooper Flagg, and Dereck Lively II. Recent losses have highlighted the team’s inconsistent three-point shooting.The finances make a trade possible. Thompson carries a $16.7 million cap hit for 2025-26, while expiring deals such as Olynyk’s $25.5 million and Barnes’ $28.5 million can help match salaries without requiring draft picks.One scenario would send Klay Thompson and injured guard Dante Exum to San Antonio. Dallas could receive Kelly Olynyk, Lindy Waters III, and either Harrison Barnes or Keldon Johnson to keep the incoming and outgoing salary near the $18-20 million range.This approach allows the Spurs to keep their young core, Wembanyama, Vassell, and Castle, while Dallas clears Thompson’s $17.5 million expiring contract for the 2026-27 season. It also helps the Mavericks manage second-apron pressure.Klay Thompson would give San Antonio a reliable catch-and-shoot option and more spacing around Wembanyama and Vassell. His experience could also help younger players such as Castle and Harper. Even with the move, the Spurs are projected to have about $41 million in cap space for 2026.Dallas would lower payroll by roughly $3.2 million this season and open minutes for younger players such as Flagg or Christie. The added flexibility could help the team build around Irving and Davis while avoiding deeper tax penalties.• Immediate shooting help with a 37.6% three-point shooter.• Veteran presence for a roster that averages around 25 years old.• Expiring contracts help protect future cap space.• Thompson’s age does not match Wembanyama’s timeline.• Trading Olynyk removes a stretch-five and reduces depth.• Financial relief and more roster flexibility.• More opportunities for younger players.• Loss of a proven shooter despite a 35.8% win rate.The potential pairing would put 22-year-old, 7-foot-4 Wembanyama next to the 36-year-old Thompson, a 6-foot-6 guard. Moving the 34-year-old Olynyk would help the Spurs stay younger overall while continuing to build around their franchise player.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to land Utah Jazz's Walker Kessler amid LeBron James free agency If the trade happens, San Antonio would take a step toward competing sooner without giving up future assets.

Impact on LeBron’s future

Who benefits?

Thehave been connected to a possible trade foras the team weighs its current title push against an uncertain future. Los Angeles is 33-21, leads the Pacific Division, and is building around Luka Dončić, LeBron James, and Deandre Ayton. With James on an expiring contract and expected to reach free agency in 2026, the front office has reason to look for younger players who can contribute now and remain part of the roster later.Kessler fits that profile. He is productive, still early in his career, and under team control for the short term. Several teams are monitoring his situation, but the Lakers stand out because of their need for interior defense and long-term stability at center.The Los Angeles Lakers are competing near the top of the Western Conference and are focused on strengthening a playoff roster. Planning ahead matters with James’ future unresolved, and adding a younger impact player would help reduce the risk of a major drop-off if he leaves.Utah is in a rebuild. The Jazz are 18-38 and sit 13th in the West despite strong scoring from Lauri Markkanen and a roster filled with recent first-round picks.Defense has been a problem for two straight seasons, and reported tension around Kessler’s extension, believed to be in the nine-figure range over five years, has increased the chances that the team could move him.On the court, Walker Kessler is averaging roughly 14.4 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 3.0 assists while shooting above 70 percent from the field with true shooting over 78 percent. His rim protection remains his main value, which explains why contenders are paying attention.A trade would likely focus on young talent and draft picks rather than a core player.Possible structure:- Los Angeles Lakers receive: Walker Kessler- Utah Jazz receive:• A young rotation player on a rookie-scale contract• A salary-matching veteran on a short or mid-range deal• At least one future first-round pick and a second-round pickKessler’s current salary makes matching contracts manageable. Utah would prioritize long-term assets, while the Lakers are unlikely to move Dončić, James, Ayton, or other key contributors if the goal is to compete this season.The framework could expand depending on negotiations. Utah might try to include another veteran contract, and Los Angeles could add a minimum-salary player or pick swap to finalize value.Kessler would improve interior defense and rebounding, allowing perimeter defenders to pressure the ball more often. He also gives the team another starting-level center next to Ayton, creating lineup flexibility and injury insurance. His timeline matches Dončić’s prime years, which helps the franchise plan beyond the James era.Moving Kessler would turn a pending extension into draft capital and a developmental player. It would also ease a crowded frontcourt that includes Jusuf Nurkić, Kevin Love, Taylor Hendricks, and Kyle Filipowski. The move would better align with a young perimeter group featuring Keyonte George, Isaiah Collier, Cody Williams, Ace Bailey, Brice Sensabaugh, and Walter Clayton Jr..Kessler scores mostly on high-percentage attempts such as lobs, dunks, and short rolls, making him a strong fit next to a ball-dominant creator like Dončić. Utah allowing 125.9 points per game also raises the question of whether committing major money to one defensive center makes sense during a rebuild.• Stronger paint defense.• Adds a young core player.• Greater lineup flexibility with two starting-caliber centers.• Likely cost includes a first-round pick and a young contributor.• Future salary pressure if Kessler signs a large extension.• Possible overlap with another traditional center.• Gains draft assets before an expensive extension.• Clears minutes in the frontcourt.• Maintains financial flexibility.• Defense could decline further without a proven rim protector.• Continued rebuilding may test fan patience.• Draft picks carry uncertainty.Trading for Kessler would show that the Lakers remain focused on competing while James is still under contract. It would also leave the team with a younger foundation if he decides to leave in 2026.In the short term, the Lakers would likely improve by adding an efficient young center without breaking up their core. Utah’s outcome would depend on how the incoming assets develop compared to Kessler’s progress.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Clippers predicted to cut ties with $152.4 million superstar prior offseason after blockbuster James Harden departure The deal has a clear logic for both sides, immediate help for a contender and long-term value for a rebuilding team.",The Los Angeles Lakers and Utah Jazz have been linked to a possible trade for Walker Kessler. The Lakers are looking for interior defense and long-term stability at center.

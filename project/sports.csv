'My job is to play': Haris Rauf stays calm as Pakistan ride out Asia Cup drama

Poll Will Pakistan successfully put India under pressure in the Asia Cup final? Yes, they will pressure India No, India will dominate

Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson urged his players to concentrate on cricket ahead of their historic first-ever Asia Cup final against India on Sunday in Dubai, following heightened tensions during their previous two encounters since the May military conflict between the nations. Pakistan secured their place in the final by defeating Bangladesh by 11 runs in Thursday's Super Four match in Dubai.The previous two India-Pakistan matches in this Asia Cup were marked by controversy, with both teams refusing to shake hands after both games.The matches saw various controversial gestures, with Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav accused of making a political statement after the first match, while Pakistan's Sahibzada Farhan and Haris Rauf made aggressive gestures in the second.""Look, my message to the players is just focus on cricket and that certainly we will be doing. In terms of gestures there has always been passion in terms of high-pressure games,"" said Hesson.India has dominated the recent encounters, winning both matches in this tournament - by seven wickets in the Group A match and by six wickets in the Super Four stage.India's supremacy extends to a seven-match winning streak against Pakistan across formats since 2022, including three ODIs and four T20Is.""We have to be good enough to put India under pressure for longer because there is a reason why they are ranked the top side in the world,"" Hesson said. ""We have to put them under pressure and that will be our challenge.""Pakistan's performance has shown improvement between the two matches. They scored only 127-9 in the first game, which India easily chased down.""I think the way we played against India in the last match was a huge step up from the first game,"" said Hesson. ""The first game was a bit passive, we allowed India to control the game.""""The last match we had that game by the scruff of the neck for long periods and it took an exceptional innings from Abhishek Sharma that took the game away from us.""In the second match, Pakistan posted a more competitive total, but Abhishek Sharma's impressive 74 runs off 39 balls helped India successfully chase down the 172-run target.""We have deserved this opportunity so it's now up to us to make the most of it,"" said Hesson. ""We have been trying to be in a position to win the trophy.""The former New Zealand coach believes his team must maintain pressure throughout the final to have a chance at victory against the world champions.","Pakistan to play India in first-ever Asia Cup final on Sunday in Dubai.

Pakistan coach fires warning ahead of Asia Cup final

Poll Which player do you think is the key for India's victory? Abhishek Sharma Shubman Gill Suryakumar Yadav Jasprit Bumrah

Former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar shared his insights ahead of the Asia Cup 2025 final between India and Pakistan at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday, emphasizing that Pakistan can overcome their previous two losses against India in the tournament if they focus on dismissing key Indian batsman Abhishek Sharma early and maintain an aggressive approach.Pakistan's recent encounters with India in the Asia Cup 2025 have been marked by heated exchanges, particularly during the Super 4s match where Pakistani pacers Haris Rauf and Shaheen Shah Afridi engaged in verbal confrontations with Indian openers Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill , though India emerged victorious.Abhishek Sharma has been instrumental in India's success throughout the tournament, scoring 74 runs off 35 balls in the previous match against Pakistan, which helped India chase down 172 runs with seven balls remaining. He also demonstrated his batting prowess against Bangladesh with a quick-fire 75 runs off 37 balls.Akhtar specifically highlighted the importance of targeting Abhishek Sharma in the early overs of the match. ""Come out of this mindset, keep their aura aside. Just break their aura. Just play with this mindset that you had in the match against Bangladesh. This is the kind of mindset you need. You don't need to bowl 20 overs; you just need to get wickets,"" Akhtar said on the 'Game On Hai' programme.""Mark my words, if Abhishek Sharma gets out in the first two overs, they will get in trouble. The starts they are getting, they are going to struggle if Abhishek gets out early. It's not like that, Abhishek will not mistime the ball; he will do that; you just need to go for the kill. If you come out fighting, India will realise that we have to work hard for our runs,"" Akhtar added.The Rawalpindi Express also shared his perspective on India's head coach Gautam Gambhir 's likely approach to the final. ""I know Gautam Gambhir. He will tell his team that 'you need to bring your A game against Pakistan'. Pakistan will play the worst cricket, they will pick the worst side, but as soon as they reach the final, they play the best cricket, and they win the finals. It has happened so my times with us,"" said Akhtar.Before the highly anticipated final, India is scheduled to play their last Super 4s match against Sri Lanka on Friday, September 26, at the Dubai International Stadium.The former Pakistani speedster, known for being one of the fastest bowlers in cricket history, advised Pakistan's team to shed their inhibitions and adopt an aggressive mindset similar to their approach against Bangladesh.The upcoming final presents an opportunity for Pakistan to reverse their fortunes against India in the tournament, where they have faced defeats in their previous encounters despite showing competitive spirit and engaging in intense on-field battles.The match promises to be a crucial contest between two cricket powerhouses, with Pakistan looking to overcome their recent setbacks and India aiming to maintain their winning momentum in the tournament.",Pakistan face India in the Asia Cup 2025 final at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.

Shaheen Afridi press conference: Hits back at Suryakumar Yadav, Haris Rauf controversy and tension

“good enough to beat anyone”

As Pakistan booked their place in the Asia Cup final, a short video went viral that left many Indian fans shaking their heads. In the clip, a Pakistani supporter shakes hands with Haris Rauf and tells him,– a phrase dripping with provocation and disrespect. The moment has added fuel to the fiery build-up for Sunday’s final in Dubai.Click here to watch the video Pakistan’s journey to the final was hardly convincing. Their batters struggled against Bangladesh, managing just 135 in 20 overs on a tricky pitch. But the bowlers, led by Shaheen Shah Afridi and Rauf, staged a fightback to defend the modest total by 11 runs. Their victory set up a third clash with India in the tournament – one that promises high tension both on and off the field.The final is already steeped in controversy. In the two previous India-Pakistan encounters, there were no post-match handshakes, while Rauf’s “6-0” and fighter-jet gestures against Indian fans drew global criticism. Sahibzada Farhan even mimicked firing a gun with his bat, turning cricket into a theatre of political provocation.Now, Pakistani fans are echoing the same hostile attitude. For Indian supporters, it’s hard not to feel anger at this constant disrespect. Yet, as captain Salman Ali Agha claims, his team is. That may be, but on Sunday, it is India’s skill, discipline, and composure that will speak louder than any gestures or slogans.The stage is set for a clash of cricket and pride. India must not just win the trophy, but also show that such theatrics and provocation will never overshadow the sport.","Pakistan face India in the Asia Cup final in Dubai on Sunday.

2 UAE, 85.7 per cent





India managed a 41-run win over Bangladesh on Wednesday, but the team’s fielding remained a major concern. The side dropped five catches in the match, bringing their tournament total to 12 missed chances, the most by any team so far in the Asia Cup.With a catching efficiency of just 67.5 per cent, India rank second-worst behind Hong Kong China. The game also marked one of the rare instances in T20Is where a single batter saw four catches dropped off them in an innings, a feat previously recorded by Jason Roy, Mohammad Hafeez, Pathum Nissanka, and now Saif Hassan Varun acknowledged the team’s shortcomings but stressed the importance of improvement. “This team has been picked for a mission till the World Cup. We have to pick up our fielding and the fielding coach will have lots to say. Last match he didn’t say much, but after today he’ll have plenty to say,” he said.He also pointed to the challenges of playing under the “Ring of Fire” floodlights and in high humidity. “It comes into your eyesight sometimes and it’s a bit of a disturbance. We have to get used to it. But at this level, you cannot make excuses. We have to take every catch,” Varun added.During the match, Bangladesh’s Saif Hassan was dropped four times at critical moments on scores of 40, 60, 65, and 69. Despite these opportunities, India’s spinners eventually shared seven wickets among them, with Kuldeep Yadav leading the charge with 3 for 18. Varun Chakravarthy took 2 for 29, Axar Patel 1 for 37, and part-timer Tilak Varma contributed to wrapping up the innings. Suryakumar Yadav also effected a key run-out to further restrict Bangladesh’s chase.The team’s struggles under pressure highlight that, while India’s batters and bowlers have been effective, fielding improvements are essential for high-level success.","India managed a 41-run win over Bangladesh on Wednesday, but the team’s fielding remained a major concern.

'Never Dreamt of This...': Rohit Sharma's BIG CONFESSION After Retirement From Test Cricket

India ODI captain Rohit Sharma is making headlines ahead of his much-awaited return to international cricket next month, revealing a striking transformation after shedding 10 kilograms. Former India batting coach and close friend Abhishek Nayar shared a glimpse of Rohit’s new look during a training session in Mumbai, writing, “10,000 grams later, we keep pushing.”The 38-year-old is expected to be back in action on October 19, when India begin their three-match ODI series against Australia. Rohit last featured for India in the Champions Trophy final in Dubai earlier this year and has spent the intervening months preparing rigorously for his return.Earlier plans for both Rohit and Virat Kohli to play in India A’s three 50-over matches against Australia A in Kanpur did not materialise, as neither was named in the squad. The two senior batters had retired from T20 internationals last June after India’s T20 World Cup triumph in Barbados and stepped away from Test cricket in May, just days before India’s England tour.Both Rohit and Kohli have completed their mandatory pre-season fitness tests. Rohit trained in Bengaluru at the BCCI ’s Centre of Excellence, extending his sessions to focus on the upcoming ODI series. Kohli, who has relocated to London following the IPL 2025 season, completed his fitness assessments there.With just weeks to go before India’s first ODI in Australia, all eyes are on Rohit’s form and fitness as he aims to lead the team in the three-match series starting October 19.","Rohit Sharma has shed 10 kilograms ahead of his return to international cricket.

Ajit Agarkar press conference: On Shreyas Iyer, Pant injury, Bumrah availability & why Karun dropped

The BCCI on Thursday announced India’s 15-member squad for the two home Tests against the West Indies, led by Shubman Gill, with senior all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja named vice-captain and Devdutt Padikkal making a return.One of the notable absentees is Shreyas Iyer . Chief selector Ajit Agarkar addressed his unavailability, saying, “Shreyas is a senior player. He has led India A as well, and we are always looking to develop leadership qualities in multiple players. Unfortunately, he won’t be available because of his fitness. More than anything, we want him playing and playing well.”Iyer is currently captaining the India A squad for three 50-over matches against Australia A in Kanpur starting September 30. He had led India A in the first unofficial four-day Test against Australia A but withdrew from the second, requesting a six-month break from red-ball cricket due to ongoing back concerns. The BCCI has approved his request. Shreyas Iyer has informed the BCCI of his decision to take a six-month break from red-ball cricket. Having undergone back surgery in the UK and managed his recovery well, he has recently experienced recurring back spasms and stiffness while playing the longer format.He wishes to utilise this period to build endurance, body resilience and work on his fitness.Iyer first faced back issues in December 2022, which reoccurred during India’s home Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in March 2023. Following surgery in April 2023, he missed the IPL and was later dropped midway through India’s home series against England in February 2024.Despite these setbacks, Iyer remains a key white-ball performer.

Sri Lankan all-rounder Dasun Shanaka expressed optimism for a competitive match against India in their final Super Four game of the Asia Cup in Dubai, despite his team's elimination from the tournament. Speaking ahead of the dead rubber match, Shanaka emphasized that Sri Lanka still has a point to prove before the T20 World Cup next year, which India and Sri Lanka will co-host.India has already secured their spot in the Asia Cup final against Pakistan, while Sri Lanka was eliminated after two losses in the Super Four stage following an unbeaten run in the group phase.""The best opponent in the tournament. We are looking for a fine match and need to prove a point. We are still good enough, but unfortunately out. But we've got a World Cup coming up, so this is a good clash against India. So, the boys have got a point to prove in this competition before leaving Dubai,"" Shanaka told ANI.Shanaka has demonstrated consistent performance against India in T20Is, scoring 430 runs in 22 innings at an average of 26.87, with two fifties and a strike rate above 140. His highest score remains an unbeaten 74.The Sri Lankan all-rounder praised India's dominance in T20 cricket over the past decade and acknowledged their system's effectiveness. He specifically mentioned Indian T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav as a ""big match player"" despite his current form.""Yeah, see, I like the way SKY (Suryakumar) plays. He has not scored many runs in this competition. But you know, he is a big match player and with the bowling, of course, Jasprit Bumrah ,"" Shanaka stated.Suryakumar has struggled in the tournament, scoring only 59 runs in four innings, with his highest being 47 not out against Pakistan. His 2023 performance has been particularly challenging, with just 87 runs in nine innings at an average of 12.42 and a strike rate of 112.98.Shanaka also commended Abhishek Sharma 's performance, noting, ""Abhishek Sharma in his prime form from IPL. So yeah, really happy for him.""Abhishek Sharma leads the tournament's run-scoring charts with 248 runs in five innings, averaging 49.60 with a strike rate of 206.66.

Pakistan cricket player Saim Ayub's batting struggles continued as he registered his fourth duck in five innings during Thursday's Asia Cup Super Four match against Bangladesh, leading former Pakistan captain Waqar Younis to call for his removal from the playing XI. The 23-year-old all-rounder, who has only managed to score 21 runs against India in the tournament, has however picked up six wickets with his bowling performances.Ayub's latest dismissal came while attempting to hit Mahedi Hasan's full delivery over the in-field, resulting in a catch at mid-on after the ball hit the inner half of his bat. This continued his poor run of form with the bat in the tournament.Despite Ayub's contributions with the ball, Waqar Younis expressed concerns about his batting form during his commentary on SonyLiv. The Pakistan cricket legend emphasized the need to protect young talent by occasionally removing them from the playing XI.""Look, I said it after the second duck, I said this guy needs to be benched. It's not that he is not talented; he is very talented. I think he is the future of Pakistan cricket. But sometimes when things are not going right for you, you just keep going in the shell, keep going down and down, and that's what is happening here with him. His body language was poor this afternoon when he walked onto the field,"" Younis stated.Younis further elaborated on his stance regarding Ayub's position in the team, highlighting the importance of focusing on his batting rather than his bowling abilities.""You know, he is a youngster, you really need to look after them sometimes, by just not playing them sometimes. Pakistan kept on playing him, just purely because he can bowl. You don't need to worry about his bowling; Pakistan needs to worry about his batting. If he is going to give us runs or not. At the moment, it's not happening. He needs to dig deeper in his game to score a few runs,"" Younis added.The young all-rounder's only successful batting performance in the tournament came against India in the Super Four stage, where he scored 21 runs from 17 balls. This remains his sole contribution with the bat across his five innings in the 2025 Asia Cup.Ayub's bowling performances have been a bright spot for Pakistan, with six wickets to his name before the Bangladesh fixture. However, his batting struggles have overshadowed his bowling contributions.The discussion around Ayub's position in the team highlights the broader challenge of managing young talent in international cricket, particularly when players face extended periods of poor form in one aspect of their game while performing well in another.The situation presents a dilemma for the Pakistan team management, who must balance the development of a young talent considered to be the future of Pakistan cricket with the immediate needs of the team in an important tournament like the Asia Cup.Ayub's recent dismissals and body language on the field have raised concerns about his confidence levels, which Younis suggests could be addressed by temporarily removing him from the playing XI to help him regain his batting form.The ongoing debate about Ayub's place in the team reflects the challenges of international cricket, where players must maintain consistent performances across all aspects of their game to justify their selection in the playing XI.","Pakistan cricket player Saim Ayub's batting struggles continued as he registered his fourth duck in five innings during Thursday's Asia Cup Super Four match against Bangladesh.

Hussain Talat on morale in Pakistan camp after Asia Cup Super 4s loss to India

Poll Who do you think will win the final match between Pakistan and India in the Asia Cup 2025? Pakistan India Too close to call

In a virtual semifinal in the Asia Cup Super Fours in Dubai, Pakistan edged past Bangladesh in a tense low-scoring contest on Thursday to set up a third clash with India in the competition.On a humid evening, Bangladesh bowlers once again impressed, but Pakistan’s lower order ensured they finished with a competitive 135 for eight from 20 overs. That total, though modest, proved sufficient on a surface where batting was never easy. Pakistan ended up securing a 11-run victory, and with that, another clash with rivals India.This also marks the first-ever meeting between the two teams in the final of the competition. In the last 16 editions of the Asia Cup, the two teams hadn't met in the summit clash.Taskin Ahmed gave Bangladesh the early breakthrough, removing Sahibzada Farhan for four. Saim Ayub fell soon after for a duck, while Fakhar Zaman (13), Hussain Talat (3) and captain Salman Ali Agha (19) also departed cheaply, leaving Pakistan reeling at 49 for five.Mohammad Haris offered some resistance with a quick 31 off 23 balls before being dismissed by Mahedi Hasan. From there, Shaheen Shah Afridi’s 19 and Mohammad Nawaz’s lively 25 off 15 balls gave Pakistan much-needed momentum. Faheem Ashraf’s unbeaten 14 at the back end took them past 130.For Bangladesh, Taskin was the main man of the attack with 3 for 28, while spinner Rishad Hossain (2/18) and Mahedi Hasan (2/28) exploited the conditions well. Mustafizur Rahman also chipped in with one wicket.In reply, Bangladesh never really settled into their chase. Early strikes by Shaheen Afridi put them under pressure, dismissing Parvez Hossain Emon and Towhid Hridoy inside the powerplay.Nurul Hasan managed 16 before falling to Saim Ayub, while captain Jaker Ali (5) also fell cheaply.Shamim Hossain’s 30 gave Bangladesh a glimmer of hope, but with the required rate climbing, Pakistan’s bowlers closed out the contest. The flurry of wickets from Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf, where he dismissed both Tanzim Hasan Sakib and Taskin Ahmed in the 18th over left Bangladesh on the brink.In his final over, which was also the last of the match, he conceded 11 runs, but had enough runs to spare to ensure victory.With this result, Pakistan confirmed their spot in the final, where they will meet India once again in what promises to be another tense clash in Dubai. With controversy surrounding the India-Pakistan clash and the stakes higher than ever, Sunday's clash will be the perfect finale for Asia Cup 2025.",Pakistan beat Bangladesh by 11 runs in the Asia Cup Super 4s in Dubai.

Poll Should India have included a younger fast bowler instead of Jasprit Bumrah in the squad? Yes, it’s a missed opportunity No, Bumrah is essential for the team

Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has questioned the decision to include Jasprit Bumrah in the squad for the upcoming home Test series against West Indies, calling it a missed opportunity to test a younger fast bowler.Bumrah, who bowled in only three of the five Tests on the recent England tour, was named in the 15-member squad for the series starting October 2 in Ahmedabad. Pathan said on his YouTube channel that while Bumrah’s commitment to Test cricket is admirable, selectors could have used this series to look at fresh pace options.“It seems like a missed opportunity not to play a young fast bowler in these two Tests, but that’s the team’s current direction. If I were a selector or manager, I would have surely tried to give a young fast bowler an opportunity, focusing on their development, not just quick results. Bumrah remains committed to Test cricket, which is fantastic,” Pathan said.He felt Indian conditions, where spinners usually dominate, were ideal to rest Bumrah and manage his workload. “Still, it’s good that Bumrah maintains Test cricket as his priority. Selectors could have utilised this series to give proper rest to Bumrah and groom a young fast bowler, something India must prioritise for long-term vision.India needs a group of eight good fast bowlers, not just three or four,” he added.Pathan also welcomed the return of Axar Patel, saying his presence strengthens India’s depth. “Axar’s return strengthens the team. When Axar plays alongside Washington and Jadeja, the team gains batting depth. Does this mean Kuldeep Yadav may miss out again? I would definitely want to see him play, but with home conditions generally allowing only two fast bowlers, his spot is not guaranteed,” he said.With this being India’s first home Test series after Ravichandran Ashwin’s retirement, Pathan raised the question of who will take up his mantle. “Who will fill that Ashwin role? Washington Sundar brings some qualities, but he does not have all of Ashwin’s traits… Jadeja supported Ashwin well, but now someone new must step up for that role. Could it be Kuldeep Yadav or Washington Sundar, or even Axar Patel? Each offers something different,” he said.",Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has questioned the decision to include Jasprit Bumrah in the squad for the upcoming home Test series against West Indies.

India’s World Cup preparations suffered a setback on Thursday after pacer Arundhati Reddy was wheelchaired off the field during the warm-up match against England in Bengaluru.The incident occurred in Reddy’s follow-through while bowling to England captain Heather Knight.

Medical staff rushed in to assist her, but she had to be taken off on a wheelchair.Before the injury, Reddy had given India an early breakthrough by dismissing opener Amy Jones.The 27-year-old seamer has become an important part of India’s pace attack since her debut last year. In 11 ODIs, she has picked up 15 wickets at an average of 32.66, with best figures of 4 for 26.

Poll Do you agree with Mohammad Kaif's assessment of Jasprit Bumrah's bowling strategy? Yes, he has a valid point No, Bumrah knows his best strategy

India pacer Jasprit Bumrah has publicly responded to former cricketer Mohammad Kaif ’s remarks on his workload management, dismissing his claims as inaccurate.On Thursday evening, Kaif raised concerns about how Bumrah was being used in white-ball cricket. Referring to the Asia Cup, he pointed out that under Suryakumar Yadav’s captaincy, Bumrah bowled three overs with the new ball rather than saving himself for the death overs.“Bumrah under Rohit would generally bowl overs 1, 13, 17, 19. Under Surya, in Asia Cup, he bowled a three-overs spell at the start. To avoid injury, Bumrah these days, prefers to bowl while his body is warmed up. 1 over of Bumrah in the remaining 14 overs is a huge relief for batters, against stronger teams at World Cup, this could hurt India,” Kaif wrote on X.Bumrah has now responded to the former India batter’s post, quoting it with a sharp dismissal. “Inaccurate before inaccurate again,” he wrote.The pacer’s reply suggests he felt Kaif’s assessment of his bowling strategy was not only incorrect this time but had been off the mark on previous occasions as well.Despite Kaif’s concerns, selectors have shown full confidence in Bumrah. He was recently included in India’s squad for the two-Test home series against West Indies, beginning October 2 in Ahmedabad.Chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar confirmed that Bumrah is fit and ready after a break following the England tour.Bumrah’s response comes at a crucial time, with India preparing for the Asia Cup final against either Pakistan or Bangladesh on Sunday.

Poll Do you believe that the Indian women's cricket team has a stronger chance of winning the ODI World Cup this year compared to previous tournaments? Yes, absolutely! No, I don't think so.

India vice-captain Smriti Mandhana believes the women’s team carries a stronger sense of belief heading into the ODI World Cup, with every player confident of being a match-winner. India will begin their campaign against Sri Lanka in Guwahati on September 30.Mandhana underlined how preparation has changed the mindset within the group. “I think our belief has changed a lot and it only changes with what work you put behind it. When the effort is there, the fight will always be there. That’s one thing that has changed with this team — everyone believes they are match-winners,” she told JioStar.The left-handed opener also admitted that the last edition of the tournament was difficult to take as an athlete. “The last T20 World Cup was something which hit me quite a lot. I thought to myself, ‘I don’t want to feel like this as an athlete in my life’. Post that, a lot of fitness and nutritional changes have come into place,” she added.Mandhana said the squad is eager to experience the support of home fans. “We all have been waiting for this World Cup. A lot of things have changed for women’s cricket in India since 2013 when I was a kid.I am really excited to see how the stadiums turn out and the way they will support. The Women’s Premier League (WPL) has made us immune to the loud crowd as well. Nothing can beat people cheering India at the stadiums,” she said.Looking back on her debut, Mandhana recalled the emotions of receiving her first India jersey. “I remember I was 17 when I got the India jersey in my room. I don’t think I can forget it. I wore it and sent the photos to my parents and my brother. They were very emotional,” she said.Captain Harmanpreet Kaur reflected on her own journey. “As a girl, it was very hard for me to dream about playing for the country. I always wanted to open with Virender Sehwag, not knowing that you can’t play in a men’s team,” she said.All-rounder Deepti Sharma credited head coach Amol Muzumdar for encouraging the team to push beyond comfort zones. “Our mindset has changed now a bit, regardless of the team we are facing and the format. We focus on what we can pull off and always talk about positive things and apply the same on the ground. We talk to Amol sir in our practice sessions and the main thing is to try and come out of our comfort zone to plan for different situations,” she said.",India will begin their campaign against Sri Lanka in Guwahati on September 30.

Aston Villa secured their first win of the season with a 1-0 victory over Bologna in their Europa League opener, while Rangers suffered a 1-0 home defeat to Genk on Thursday, intensifying pressure on their manager Russell Martin. The matches marked the beginning of the Europa League campaign for both teams.Villa, despite being pre-tournament favorites and reaching the Champions League quarter-finals last season, had struggled with their form, failing to win any of their first five Premier League games. The victory came amid internal tensions, with manager Unai Emery recently criticizing his players and sporting director Monchi departing the club.John McGinn's strike in the 13th minute proved decisive for Villa. The Scotland international found the bottom corner with a shot from the edge of the area.Ollie Watkins, who started on the bench due to his goalless run this season, missed a penalty in the second half with Łukasz Skorupski making an easy save.Bologna came close to equalizing when Santiago Castro's header hit the crossbar, but Villa managed to hold on for the win, repeating their success against the Italian side from their previous Champions League encounter.""Important to get a win at home after not our strongest start to the season,"" McGinn said. ""We haven't been good enough. We've had a lot of praise the past couple of seasons and we're rightly being criticised at the minute.""Rangers' situation worsened as they played with ten men after Mohamed Diomande's red card before halftime for a dangerous challenge.Former Celtic striker Oh Hyeon-Gyu missed a penalty for Genk in first-half stoppage time but redeemed himself by scoring the winning goal ten minutes into the second half.Martin, who joined Rangers in June, has now gone eight games without a win in both Scottish Premiership and European competitions.In other Europa League matches, Lille secured a 2-1 victory over Norwegian side Brann with Olivier Giroud scoring the winner.American player Tanner Tessmann helped Lyon defeat Utrecht 1-0.Stuttgart emerged victorious with a 2-1 win over Celta Vigo.Porto claimed a 1-0 away victory against RB Salzburg.","Aston Villa secured their first win of the season with a 1-0 victory over Bologna.

Oviedo goalkeeper Aaron Escandell made multiple saves from his attempts.""I saw the goalkeeper's mistake and I went first time, and in the moment I kicked it, I saw it was good,"" Oviedo midfielder Reina told DAZN. ""My first in the top flight, I'll never forget it.""Flick defended his goalkeeper's mistake: ""It's the style that we want him to play in, and it can happen. He's a fantastic goalkeeper... one mistake and they use it, but it's football.""De Jong's introduction at halftime helped Barcelona increase their tempo. Escandell continued making saves from Raphinha and Torres before Lewandowski's breakthrough.""The changes were at the right time, with Frenkie and also with Lewy,"" said Flick.Lewandowski, who has mainly been used as a substitute this season following an early injury, showed patience: ""I'm patient, I'm not in a hurry, the season is long and we have a lot of games.""Despite the loss, Oviedo's goalscorer remained positive: ""All footballers dream of nights like this, to play against these players and with these fans.

Indian Women's League: Women-heavy coaching team for Sethu FC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/indian-womens-league-women-heavy-coaching-team-for-sethu-fc/articleshow/124130026.cms,"Rutuja Gunwant

CHENNAI: Indian Women’s League (IWL) club Sethu FC have appointed women in positions of power for the upcoming season. While Rutuja Gunwant has been roped in as the head coach, Kulsum Bi Shaikh and Surbhi Manjrekar have been anointed the head of women’s football and assistant coach respectively.The 2025-26 IWL is expected to begin in the first week of November and end in April, with the top-tier league taking a big break for the AFC Women’s Asian Cup – where the India senior team will compete – in Australia in March.Rutuja will fill the seat vacated by Arun Kumar, who had replaced Shareef Khan midway through the previous season. Rutuja had represented Sethu as a player in the club’s formative years and most recently served as a coach for the Gokulam Kerala FC women’s team. As for Kulsum, she was associated with Odisha FC in the last IWL season.“We felt that it would be better to hand over the coaching duties to a known face. We wanted to have people who are familiar with the system (Indian women’s football). I personally felt that women coaches would be able to handle our players in a better way. That is why we have gone with a women-heavy coaching and staff contingent this time,” Seeni Mohaideen, founder and owner of the Tamil Nadu-based club, told TOI on Thursday.Having finished a disappointing fifth in the previous IWL campaign, Sethu, champions of the 2018-19 season, are determined to once again battle for top honours. In the close season, they have shown ambition, securing the services of forward Lynda Kom and midfielder Grace Lalrampari by paying transfer fee to the now-relegated Odisha.Sethu have retained approximately 14 domestic players and are likely to sign two foreign outfield members – from Africa – and an overseas goalkeeper. “We have players who are part of the India team. We also have young talent in the squad, so it should be a good mix. Our ultimate goal is to get to the AFC Women’s Champions League (the IWL winners will have an opportunity to qualify for the tournament),” Seeni added.Seeni also stressed that the IWL clubs are finding it increasingly difficult to plan for the season ahead, due to lack of clarity regarding the schedule. “The fixtures are yet to be finalised by the AIFF, so we do not know when we will play our home matches. We need to book the stadium soon,” said Seeni while confirming that Chennai’s Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium will remain the club’s home venue.Sethu FC staff: Rutuja Gunwant (head coach), Kulsum Bi Shaikh (head of women’s football), Surbhi Manjrekar (assistant coach), Aadil Ansari (goalkeeping coach), John Mark Danny (strength and conditioning coach), Akshayaa (physiotherapist), Parthiban (head of operations).",Sethu FC appoint women in positions of power for the upcoming season.

(AP Photo/Jose Breton)

Antony's late goal denied Nottingham Forest a winning return to European football as Real Betis grabbed a 2-2 draw in their Europa League opener on Wednesday, while Roma won at Nice.Forest, managed by Ange Postecoglou who won the tournament with Tottenham last season, are playing in Europe for the first time in 30 years.They are only in the Europa League rather than the Conference League because English FA Cup winners Crystal Palace fell foul of UEFA 's rules governing multi-club ownership.Last season's Conference League runners-up Betis struck first in the 15th minute when Antony's pass picked out Cedric Bakambu inside the area, before the veteran striker turned and fired the ball into the roof of the net.But Forest levelled three minutes later as a sweeping move finished with Morgan Gibbs-White's low ball across the face of goal being tapped in from close range by Igor Jesus.Brazilian Igor Jesus, who scored his first goals for Forest since his summer move from Botafogo against Swansea last week, completed the turnaround midway through the first half with a clinical header from Douglas Luiz's corner.Postecoglou's men threatened to seize complete control before half-time, as Igor Jesus twice went close to a hat-trick and Callum Hudson-Odoi hit a shot against the post.Betis managed to stay in the game, though, and a period of late pressure paid dividends when Antony slotted in Marc Roca's ball at the back post with five minutes remaining.""I think first I should be proud of the players' efforts. It's a difficult place to come, difficult conditions,"" Postecoglou, still waiting for his first win in charge since replacing the sacked Nuno Espirito Santo, told TNT Sports.""The thing I could fault is we didn't put the game to bed.""Roma got their campaign for a first Europa League title under way with an impressive 2-1 victory at Nice.Gian Piero Gasperini's men, who have reached at least the semi-finals in three of the previous five seasons, secured a winning start thanks to two goals in the space of three second-half minutes from Evan Ndicka and Gianluca Mancini.Terem Moffi pulled one back for Nice from the penalty spot with 13 minutes to play, but Roma held on.Local authorities and prosecutors said 102 people identified as Roma ultras, many of whom caught with potential weapons, were arrested in the build-up to the game for intending to commit violence.Celtic, playing in the competition for the first time since 2021 after an embarrassing loss to Kairat Almaty in Champions League qualifying, were held to a 1-1 draw by fellow former European champions Red Star Belgrade in Serbia.A long spell of Celtic pressure at the start of the first half culminated in Kelechi Iheanacho's second goal since signing on a free transfer from Sevilla earlier this month.Red Star hit back, though, in the 65th minute as Marko Arnautovic turned in Franklin Tebo Uchenna's cross.Elsewhere, Dinamo Zagreb beat Fenerbahce 3-1 in the Croatian capital, while Bundesliga side Freiburg clinched a 2-1 home win over Basel.",Nottingham Forest held 2-2 by Real Betis in Europa League opener.

Chelsea survive

Alexander Isak scored his first Liverpool goal to inspire a 2-1 win against Southampton in the League Cup third round, while Chelsea survived a scare to beat third-tier Lincoln on Tuesday.Isak was making his third appearance for Liverpool since his British record £125 million ($169 million) move from Newcastle on transfer deadline day.The 26-year-old had drawn a blank in his 58-minute debut appearance against Atletico Madrid and also failed to net after coming off the bench for the last 23 minutes of Saturday's Merseyside derby win over Everton.But Isak got off the mark in the 43nd minute as Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy tried a short pass that was intercepted by Federico Chiesa, who picked out the Sweden striker to fire home.It was a belated birthday present for Isak, who turned 26 on Sunday.Isak, who had scored for Newcastle in their League Cup final win against Liverpool last season, was taken off at half-time as he builds up his fitness after missing pre-season training while his transfer was being negotiated.Shea Charles equalised for the Championship side in the 76th minute with a close-range finish after a wayward header from Liverpool's Wataru Endo.Arne Slot had made 11 changes from the Everton game but substitute Hugo Ekitike saved Liverpool's understudies from a penalty shoot-out when he finished off Chiesa's pass in the 85th minute.The French striker took off his shirt to celebrate and was dismissed for a second bookable offence.Liverpool have made a perfect start to the season, with seven successive wins, including five in the Premier League to take them to the top of the table and one in the Champions League against Atletico.""Not our best performance. You can expect that if you play a complete new team. So many players that haven't played for a long time,"" Slot said.""There were positives. Giorgi Mamardashvili had a good game in goal.

Barcelona's long-awaited return to their renovated Camp Nou has been pushed back after the city council rejected the club's request for an essential safety permit on Tuesday.The Spanish champions had hoped to host Real Sociedad this Sunday at their iconic home with a reduced capacity of 27,000 spectators. Instead, Hansi Flick's men will continue to play at the Olympic Stadium on Montjuic hill, their temporary base for the past two seasons during construction.“The club continues to work on obtaining the necessary administrative permits for the opening of Spotify Camp Nou in the coming weeks,” Barcelona said in a statement, adding that they are working on amendments requested by the council.The city's fire department highlighted issues with evacuation routes and other safety concerns. Deputy mayor Laia Bonet stressed that public safety was the council's top priority.“We share the club's desire to return as soon as possible, but this city council must guarantee the safety of everyone who wants to go to the stadium,” Bonet said. “We will not take a month or a minute longer than necessary to grant the license once all requirements are met.”Barcelona's operations director, Joan Sentelles, defended the stadium's progress: “Just because it's not finished, doesn't mean it's not safe,” he told reporters, noting that the roof will now be completed in summer 2027, a year later than scheduled.Initially set to reopen in November 2024, the Camp Nou project has faced repeated delays. The rebuild is estimated to cost €1.5 billion ($1.75 billion).For now, Barcelona's homecoming remains on hold, leaving fans eager for their return to Europe's largest football stadium waiting a little longer.","Barcelona's long-awaited return to their renovated Camp Nou has been pushed back.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

NEW DELHI: While the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and the government continued to publicly cling to hopes of a last-minute miracle, the reality behind closed doors painted a far bleaker picture for the national team. According to reports, the ICC is expected to replace Bangladesh with Scotland for the ICC T20 World Cup 2026 soon after Bangladesh refused to travel to India citing security concerns.At the centre of the unfolding crisis was a much-anticipated meeting between Bangladesh’s national cricketers, sports advisor Asif Nazrul, and senior BCB officials on Thursday. Many believed the gathering would give players — a chance to influence a decision that could define their careers. Instead, the meeting served a very different purpose.As per a cricbuzz report, the cricketers were not summoned to provide consent but were effectively informed that their World Cup dream was already over. The government, having concluded that the ICC had failed to deliver “proper justice” on Bangladesh’s request to relocate matches to Sri Lanka, was unwilling to shift its stance.“The meeting was called not to give our consent as it was made out to be initially.Rather, we were called so that we are aware of the development in the ongoing crisis,” said a cricketer on condition of anonymity. “They made up their mind and decided what they will do before coming into the meeting, and it's not like any decision was taken taking our views into consideration.”Players were briefly allowed to speak. Cricbuzz report added that most were in favour of playing the T20 World Cup despite the challenges. Their views, however, appeared inconsequential.“They didn't ask. They made the plan directly and said it's not happening,” the cricketer added. “The thing is, Bangladesh's government call was already made… it was a direct order from the government — it's not happening.”Following the meeting, Nazrul maintained that Bangladesh would not change its position, accusing the ICC of failing to address the country’s specific grievances. He claimed neither the ICC nor the Indian government had taken meaningful steps to ensure safety.“Cricket is finished. If we don't go, it will be our cricket's loss. Who cares?” said another cricketer.As per the report, T20 captain Litton Das and Test captain Najmul Hossain Shanto spoke during the meeting, insisting the team was ready and willing to play. In response, government and BCB officials cited past threats to Bangladeshi players, raising concerns about the safety of players, spectators, and journalists.Officials also told the players that the BCCI had not contacted them directly. “Bangladesh is supposed to go, but now if they act like this, how can a country send a team?” one source said.BCB president Aminul Islam Bulbul attempted to reassure the players, but his words offered little comfort. “What can he say apart from giving us comfort mentally? We understand his situation very well,” the cricketer said. “We knew from the beginning that they already decided that we're not going.”A member of the team management summed up the mood: “I feel sorry for the cricketers… they worked hard to become a formidable T20I unit. We can only hope this too shall pass.”",Bangladesh refused to travel to India citing security concerns. The ICC is expected to replace Bangladesh with Scotland for the ICC T20 World Cup 2026.

Poll Do you believe Virat Kohli was forced to retire from Test cricket? Yes No

NEW DELHI: Former India batter Manoj Tiwary has reignited the debate around Virat Kohli’s Test retirement with a sensational claim, insisting the former India captain was “forced” into stepping away from the longest format rather than walking away by choice.Kohli’s decision to retire from Tests continues to dominate cricketing discourse, largely because his red-ball career defined an era for India. With contemporaries like Joe Root and Steve Smith still piling up Test hundreds, the void left by Kohli remains a constant talking point.Speaking to InsideSport, Tiwary strongly disagreed with Sanjay Manjrekar’s assertion that Kohli left the “hardest format” to continue in the “easiest” one. “I don’t agree with him. Usko majboor kiya gaya tha,” Tiwary said. “An atmosphere was created as such that he had to say goodbye to Test cricket. He is not someone who would just decide on his own to leave. Yes, the decision came from his mouth, but everyone knows what happened behind the scenes. ”Tiwary added that, given the context, it was unfair to accuse Kohli of choosing formats merely to pad his numbers. “After knowing everything, how can you say he left the hardest format to play the easiest one just for runs? I don’t agree with him,” he reiterated.While the Test debate rages on, Kohli’s bat continues to do the talking in ODIs. Despite India failing to seal the ODI series against New Zealand, Kohli produced a valiant century — a lone-warrior effort that kept India in the contest and once again underlined his enduring class.Kohli smashed a 108-ball 124, laced with 10 fours and three sixes in the third ODI against the Kiwis. The knock marked Kohli’s 85th international century and his 54th ODI hundred, extending his own record. It was also his seventh ODI ton against New Zealand, the most by any batter, further reinforcing that while his Test chapter may be closed, Kohli’s impact on the game is far from over.",Former India batter Manoj Tiwary says Virat Kohli was 'forced' to retire from Test cricket. Kohli announced his retirement from the longest form of the game earlier this month. The batsman's red-ball career has defined an era for India. The 33-year-old scored a valiant 124 in the third ODI against New Zealand.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127229652,imgsize-43952,width-400,resizemode-4/virat-kohli.jpg"

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Thursday accused the International Cricket Council (ICC) of applying double standards after rejecting Bangladesh’s request to move its T20 World Cup matches out of India, while previously allowing India to play the 2025 Champions Trophy at a neutral venue.Speaking to reporters in Dhaka, BCB president Aminul Islam said the ICC had shown flexibility in the past but refused to extend the same option to Bangladesh. His comments came after a meeting involving Bangladesh sports adviser Asif Nazrul, BCB officials and national team players, following the board’s decision to not travel to India for the T20 World Cup.Aminul said India were given special treatment during the 2025 Champions Trophy by being allowed to play all their matches in Dubai.""When a country refused to travel to another country for the Champions Trophy last February, the ICC organised a neutral venue for them. The team played all their Champions Trophy matches in that neutral venue. They played in one ground, staying in one hotel. It was a privilege,"" Aminul Islam said, as quoted by ESPNcricinfo.The T20 World Cup is scheduled to begin on February 7, with India and Sri Lanka listed as hosts.Aminul said Bangladesh had proposed a similar arrangement, allowing them to play their matches in Sri Lanka under a hybrid model.""We are calling Sri Lanka co-hosts, but they are not co-hosts. Sri Lanka is part of the hybrid model where one country is going to play,"" Aminul said. ""We indicated to the ICC that since our government is reluctant (to let us play in India), we want to take that option. Still, they denied our request. We will communicate with the ICC today. We are ready to play the World Cup in Sri Lanka. We don't want to play in India,"" he added.The ICC had earlier approved a hybrid model for India-Pakistan matches, allowing Pakistan to host the 2025 Champions Trophy while India played its matches in the UAE. Pakistan’s women’s team also played their 2025 Women’s ODI World Cup matches in Sri Lanka while India hosted the tournament.The standoff began after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) asked Kolkata Knight Riders to release Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman from their IPL 2026 squad amid protests in the country against attacks on minorities in Bangladesh.After Rahman’s release from the IPL, the BCB cited safety concerns for its players and staff as the reason for refusing to travel to India for the T20 World Cup.Bangladesh sports adviser Asif Nazrul said the decision was taken by the government and would not be reversed.""Let me tell you clearly. It is the government's decision not to play in India due to security concerns,"" Nazrul said on Thursday.The ICC on Wednesday had rejected the BCB’s request to move its matches out of India for the upcoming T20 World Cup.Under the current schedule, Bangladesh are set to begin their T20 World Cup 2026 campaign against West Indies at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on February 7. They will then play Italy on February 9 at the same venue, followed by another match against England in Kolkata. Bangladesh are scheduled to travel to Mumbai to face Nepal at the Wankhede Stadium after the England game.",Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) accuse International Cricket Council (ICC) of applying double standards.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Former India cricketer Atul Wassan has weighed in on the ongoing standoff involving the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and the ICC, suggesting that Bangladesh should look to ease tensions with India rather than seek a relocation of its matches from India ahead of the T20 World Cup 2026.Speaking to ANI, Wassan said the appointment of Litton Das as Bangladesh captain could be used as a bridge-building opportunity between the two countries. He argued that shifting matches at such a late stage would pose serious logistical challenges for the ICC and maintained that India is capable of providing robust security for visiting teams.“It is a logistical nightmare for the ICC. The preparations for the T20 World Cup have been going on for so long, and it is not possible to do so with the tournament so close now. I don’t think there will be any security issues in India. We have foolproof security and safety measures in place here,” Wassan said. He added, “Your captain is a Hindu, and I think Bangladesh should use the tournament as an olive branch and assuage the ongoing tensions. ”On Wednesday, the ICC confirmed that the T20 World Cup 2026 would go ahead as scheduled, with Bangladesh’s matches remaining in India. The decision followed an ICC Board meeting held via video conference, which was convened after the BCB requested that its fixtures be moved to Sri Lanka citing security concerns.Wassan said Bangladesh’s position does not align with the ICC’s stance and described the request as impractical at short notice. “You cannot just wake up one day and write a letter asking for your matches to be shifted. Things don’t move in this manner,” he said. “The ICC must have told them to either get in line or get out, and I think the BCB knows it.”Despite the ICC’s ruling, BCB president Aminul Islam Bulbul reiterated on Thursday that the board remains firm on its decision not to play its World Cup matches in India.The Men’s T20 World Cup is scheduled to begin on February 7, with India and Sri Lanka serving as co-hosts.","Former India cricketer Atul Wassan has weighed in on the ongoing standoff involving the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and the ICC.

TEAMS and TITLES:

NEW DELHI: Who will lift the 2026 ICC Under-19 World Cup title? It’s the question on everyone’s lips, with most fans and experts tipping India and Australia as the frontrunners, given their dominant performances in the tournament. India began the 2026 edition as the most successful team in the competition’s history, boasting five titles, while Australia, the defending champions, follow closely with four crowns to their name.However, former South Africa spinner Paul Adams, renowned for his unorthodox and unique bowling action, has identified Pakistan as the team to watch out for in this edition of the tournament.Pakistan’s growing reputation has been fuelled by a series of outstanding recent performances, most notably their Under-19 Asia Cup triumph, where they stunned India by 191 runs. That emphatic win not only delivered them the title but also sent a strong message to the rest of the field, underlining Pakistan’s credentials as a serious force at the Under-19 World Cup.With momentum firmly on their side and confidence soaring, Pakistan could well upset the traditional favourites as the tournament progresses.“We played against India just before coming to the World Cup. We had a series, so they are always going to bring a good side to the table.But if you watch the U19 Asia Cup and all of those tournaments, I’m quite confident Pakistan have a strong side. They’ve got some really good fast bowlers in their group. They are looking solid. And, you know, it’s always going to be the top nations competing against each other. There are some good young players in Australia as well,” Adams, who is currently working as South African U19 team’s bowling coach, told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.“A few months ago, we played against them [Pakistan] as well, and there are some good quality cricketers in that group. So, yeah, we’ve done a bit of homework on all of them, and watched them closely. We’re preparing to push into the semifinals and knockout stages, and anything can happen on those days,” said Adams.“I’m the spin bowling lead for Cricket South Africa, so I work across the entire high-performance setup within Cricket South Africa. That involves working with the Under-19s and sometimes moving up and down across various teams,” he said.Meanwhile, Sri Lanka, Australia, India, England, Pakistan, Afghanistan, South Africa and West Indies have all progressed to the next stage of the tournament.India - 2000, 2008, 2012, 2018, 2022Australia - 1988, 2002, 2010, 2024Pakistan - 2004, 2006England - 1998South Africa - 2014West Indies - 2016Bangladesh - 2020","Pakistan won the Under-19 Asia Cup last year, beating India by 191 runs.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh has refused to travel for the upcoming World Cup in India, citing security concerns. Bangladesh's sports adviser Asif on Thursday criticised cricket’s governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), for failing to address Bangladesh’s grievances.Addressing a press conference in Dhaka, Youth and Sports adviser Nazrul stressed that assessing potential security risks for citizens travelling abroad is the sole responsibility of the concerned government and not a matter for external parties to determine.“There is no scope to change our decision. We are not giving up yet. Our team is ready, and we still hope that the ICC will deliver justice. We want the ICC to take our genuine security risk into consideration and allow us to play in Sri Lanka,” Asif Nazrul said after a meeting with Bangladesh team cricketers and BCB officials.“There has been no change in the security risk situation regarding playing in India at present. This concern is not based on any abstract or hypothetical idea; rather, it stems from a real incident in which the Indian cricket board failed to provide security to one of our top players, Mustafizur Rahman, under pressure from extremists, and he was asked to leave India.“Since the Indian cricket board is effectively an extended arm of the government and could not ensure the safety of even a single player, no assurance has been given by the ICC or the Indian government that they would be able to guarantee the security of our entire team, journalists, and spectators,” he added.Supporting the government’s position, Bangladesh Cricket Board president Aminul Islam Bulbul said the board remains resolute in its demand.“A world organisation cannot impose a 24-hour ultimatum. We will keep fighting,” said Bulbul.“Bangladesh is a cricket-loving nation. If a country of nearly 200 million people misses the World Cup, the ICC will lose a huge audience.“Cricket is entering the Olympics in 2028, Brisbane in 2032, with India bidding for 2036. Excluding a major cricket-loving country like Bangladesh would be a failure. We are still fighting. Our only demand is to play the World Cup — but not in India. We want to play in Sri Lanka or another neutral venue. Our team is ready.”Earlier on Wednesday, the ICC rejected Bangladesh Cricket Board’s (BCB’s) request to relocate Bangladesh’s matches from India and chose to keep the tournament’s schedule unchanged after a board meeting.","Bangladesh has refused to travel for the upcoming World Cup in India, citing security concerns.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan have expressed disappointment over the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) decision to proceed with Bangladesh’s matches in India for the upcoming Men’s T20 World Cup, but sources have made it clear that withdrawing from the tournament is not under consideration. The ICC’s rejection of Bangladesh’s request to relocate their matches to Sri Lanka on security grounds has triggered debate across the region, even as the tournament schedule remains intact.According to a report by Telecom Asia Sport, Pakistan had backed Bangladesh’s stance in principle, drawing parallels with its own recent experience of playing India at neutral venues. However, PCB officials believe there is little room for manoeuvre at this stage and see no valid basis for a boycott.“Pakistan backed Bangladesh’s stance on principles because, on India’s insistence, their matches were moved out from Pakistan to Dubai, but the same reason by Bangladesh was not accepted, which is disappointing,” sources told Telecom Asia Sport. Despite that support, the same sources stressed that Pakistan’s options do not extend to pulling out of the World Cup.“Pakistan is considering various options, but withdrawal from the event is never an option nor was it considered,” they said.Officials also underlined that Pakistan are already scheduled to play their matches at a neutral venue, where there are no security concerns. “PCB officials understand they do not have a valid reason to boycott the event, as they are already playing in a neutral venue,” the report added. Sources further clarified that Pakistan never officially threatened to withdraw, insisting that much of the speculation originated on social media.Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal echoed the sense of resignation around the ICC’s call, describing the outcome as expected. “Most of the ICC decisions prove they are in favour of India, and this should not happen as member countries deserve equal treatment,” Kamran told Telecom Asia Sport.He cited past examples to underline his point. “Champions Trophy case was one example where India’s will was accepted because they are a revenue generator for ICC and they also forced Pakistan to host the 2023 Asia Cup on a hybrid model,” Kamran said. At the same time, he acknowledged the constraints facing the governing body. “I think ICC was in a tough situation as they had decided the schedule, and at this point, it was tough to change it.

Several leading Pakistani cricketers, including former captain Babar Azam , wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Rizwan, and pace ace Shaheen Shah Afridi, are reportedly among the victims of a massive financial scam that could see them lose millions of rupees, a source has revealed.A Ponzi scheme is a type of investment fraud in which returns are paid to earlier investors using the money from new investors rather than from actual profit. When new funds dry up, the scheme collapses, leaving many at a loss.The alleged fraud has caught the attention of the Pakistan Cricket Board, which is said to be investigating the matter, according to PTI.As per the source, around a dozen current national players — including Fakhar Zaman , Shadab Khan , and others — along with a former Test captain, had invested significant sums with a Pakistani businessman who has now reportedly fled the country.“The businessman, who was well known to the players and had even sponsored some Pakistan Super League franchises, initially made profit payments to the investors for the first few months. But then the payments stopped,” the source said.When the cricketers sought answers, the businessman allegedly claimed that he had suffered major losses, including both their investments and his own, and was unable to return the money. Subsequently, he reportedly ceased all communication and left the country.According to the source, many players had invested not only their personal funds but also money belonging to family members and close associates.“It appears to have been a Ponzi scheme that collapsed. These players now face the prospect of losing millions of rupees,” the source added.","Former captain Babar Azam and wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Rizwan are among the victims of a massive financial scam.

India’s T20 World Cup-winning captain Rohit Sharma praised young batter Tilak Varma for his mindset and composure, and also shared a light-hearted piece of advice for spinner Kuldeep Yadav ahead of the T20 World Cup, which begins on February 7.Rohit, who ended India’s ICC title drought by leading the team to the T20 World Cup title in 2024 — the country’s first ICC trophy since the 2013 Champions Trophy — was speaking on JioHotstar’s programme.During the interaction, Rohit spoke about his India and Mumbai Indians teammate Tilak Varma, saying the left-hander is already showing signs of handling pressure games.""I think he has something different. Attitude is superb. The temperament is, most importantly, the knock in the Asia Cup final (against Pakistan last year), unbelievable. He is already showing signs that he is a big match player,"" Rohit said.Tilak is expected to play a key role for India in the T20 World Cup. He has scored 1,183 runs in 40 matches and 37 innings at an average of 49.29, with a strike rate of 144.09. His tally includes two centuries and six half-centuries.At number three, Tilak has made 542 runs in 15 innings at an average of 60.22 and a strike rate of over 160, with two centuries and three fifties.His highest score in that position is an unbeaten 120. He can adjust his game between holding the innings together and scoring quickly when required.Though he scored back-to-back centuries in South Africa towards the end of 2024, his unbeaten 69 against Pakistan in the Asia Cup remains one of his most talked-about innings. Batting at number four, he helped India chase 147 in a tight match. At that position, he has scored 490 runs in 14 innings at an average of 54.44 and a strike rate of over 128, including two fifties. (ANI)Rohit also spoke about Kuldeep Yadav, who is expected to be an important part of India’s bowling attack in the tournament, and shared a humorous message for the spinner.""Koi advice nahi hai bhaisahab ko. Chup chaap apna ball daal. Aur peeche ja, on every ball you cannot appeal yaar. (No advice to this guy. Just bowl and go back. You cannot appeal on every ball),"" Rohit said.Kuldeep has taken 90 wickets in 50 T20Is for India at an average of 13.17 and an economy rate of 6.82. His best figures are 5/17. He has three four-wicket hauls and two five-wicket hauls in the format.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has laid bare the sequence of events that led to its refusal to travel to India for the upcoming T20 World Cup, with president Aminul Islam Bulbul stating that Mustafizur Rahman’s removal from an IPL franchise on security grounds was the tipping point.Speaking to media in Dhaka, Bulbul said Mustafizur was neither injured nor had withdrawn himself from the Indian Premier League, nor had the BCB revoked his No Objection Certificate (NOC). “He was dropped due to security reasons,” Bulbul said, calling it a moment that raised serious red flags for Bangladesh cricket.According to Bulbul, once the BCB learned of Mustafizur’s ouster, it immediately reached out to the International Cricket Council (ICC) on January 4. “We informed them of the situation and asked them to take this seriously,” he said. “If a player can be removed from a league due to security concerns, how can we ignore those same concerns for a World Cup?”Bulbul said the BCB proposed solutions rather than confrontation, pointing to precedents where neutral venues and hybrid models had been adopted due to security issues, including past ICC tournaments such as the Champions Trophy. “We asked the ICC to follow that logic,” he said. “Let us play the World Cup, but at a neutral venue like Sri Lanka or elsewhere.”The ICC, however, rejected Bangladesh’s application. Bulbul confirmed that a vote was held at an ICC meeting, though he said he was barred from revealing the exact numbers. “What I can say is that we are deeply concerned,” he added.The BCB president warned that excluding Bangladesh from the T20 World Cup would be a damaging decision for the global game.“Bangladesh is a cricket-loving nation of nearly 200 million people,” Bulbul said. “If Bangladesh misses the World Cup, the ICC will lose a massive audience.”He also placed the issue in a broader context, noting cricket’s inclusion in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, the Brisbane 2032 Games, and India’s bid to host the 2036 Olympics. “Leaving out a major cricket nation at this stage would be a failure for the sport,” he argued.When asked about the players’ views, Bulbul declined to go into detail, calling it “personal.” He also denied reports that Bangladesh had been offered an option where players could travel with maximum security while journalists and fans stayed away. “No such communication took place,” he said.Bulbul was particularly critical of what he described as a 24-hour ultimatum issued to the BCB. “A world organisation cannot impose a 24-hour deadline,” he said. “We will keep fighting.”“Our demand is simple,” Bulbul concluded. “We want to play the World Cup — but not in India. Our team is ready.”","Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) refuse to travel to India for T20 World Cup. President Aminul Islam Bulbul says Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit was tipping point.

The much-anticipated Shubman Gill versus Ravindra Jadeja contest failed to live up to its billing on the opening day of the Ranji Trophy sixth-round clash between Punjab and Saurashtra, with both senior India players enduring forgettable outings as wickets fell in heaps.Jadeja managed just 7 runs from six balls before being dismissed, while Gill’s stay was even shorter. Punjab’s captain was out for a duck, falling to the second delivery he faced. By the end of a frenetic Day 1, 15 wickets had already gone, setting the tone for a low-scoring contest.Both players arrived under pressure. Jadeja continues to face questions over his batting form, while Gill’s leadership has come under scrutiny in recent months. Although Gill showed signs of revival with back-to-back half-centuries during India’s recent 2-1 home series loss to New Zealand, consistency has remained elusive. He was also left out of India’s T20I plans earlier.This match marked Gill’s return to Ranji Trophy cricket after a year, his previous appearance coming against Karnataka in January last season. He had featured in a couple of Vijay Hazare Trophy games recently but only resumed red-ball duties now.Batting at No. 5 instead of his usual Test position, Gill was trapped LBW by left-arm spinner Parth Bhut. His dismissal reduced Punjab to 73 for 4, and the slide continued soon after as the score slipped to 87 for 5.Earlier, Saurashtra were bowled out for 172 in 47.1 overs. Jadeja struck an early boundary but was caught shortly after, unable to anchor the innings.Several other Indian players are also involved across venues. Nitish Kumar Reddy is bowling against Mumbai, Mohammed Siraj has already claimed a wicket, and Sarfaraz Khan registered a half-century. Rishabh Pant remains unavailable as he continues recovering from an injury sustained ahead of the New Zealand ODI series.The Ranji Trophy has resumed following a two-month break for white-ball competitions. With only two league matches remaining, teams are pushing for places ahead of the quarter-finals, scheduled to begin on February 6.","Shubman Gill and Ravindra Jadeja fail to live up to billing on opening day of Ranji Trophy sixth-round clash between Punjab and Saurashtra.

Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has called on the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to take a hard stance and boycott the upcoming Men’s T20 World Cup, urging it to stand shoulder to shoulder with Bangladesh amid the ongoing scheduling and security dispute.The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) is facing the threat of being excluded from the 20-team tournament if it refuses to travel to India, citing security concerns. On Wednesday, the ICC made its position clear, stating that the original schedule would remain unchanged and that Bangladesh’s request to relocate its matches to Sri Lanka would not be entertained. The BCB has been given a 24-hour window to consult with its government and confirm whether the team will participate.With tensions simmering between the ICC and the BCB, Latif said this was the right moment for Pakistan to challenge what he described as the prevailing cricketing power structure by withdrawing from the tournament.Recent reports in Pakistani media suggest the PCB has already expressed solidarity with Bangladesh, with the board’s leadership even pausing the national team’s World Cup preparations while awaiting clarity on the situation.“If Pakistan and India don’t happen, 50 per cent of your World Cup is gone. This is a great opportunity to challenge the existing cricket order,” Latif said on the YouTube channel CaughtBehindShow.“Pakistan should say they stand with Bangladesh and refuse to play the T20 World Cup. This is the time to take a stand. You need a strong heart to do it,” he added.Latif also took aim at the ICC’s handling of the issue, questioning its refusal to consider Bangladesh’s request to move matches to Sri Lanka. He pointed out that similar adjustments had been made in the past when India and Pakistan declined to tour each other for global events.“It doesn’t feel like a good decision. Today, the ICC says there is no danger to Bangladeshi players in India. No agency in the world can say there is no danger — how can the ICC say that?” Latif said. “Even in the most secure places, no one can give such a guarantee. Hopefully, nothing happens to any team.”He stressed that Pakistan holds significant leverage in the current scenario and should use it decisively.“The trump card is still with Pakistan. Bangladesh’s stance is right. Pakistan won’t get a better opportunity than this. Pakistan not playing would be like stopping the World Cup. Pakistan is the key,” Latif said. “Yes, Pakistan could suffer in the future. There could be sanctions if Pakistan refuses to play ICC events. But there is no use of just words — now is the time to show who you support.”The Men’s T20 World Cup is scheduled to be held in India and Sri Lanka from February 7 to March 8, with matches spread across eight venues. Bangladesh have been placed in Group C alongside England, Nepal, Italy and the West Indies. Pakistan, meanwhile, are drawn in Group A with India, Namibia, the Netherlands and the USA.","Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has called on the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to take a hard stance and boycott the upcoming Men’s T20 World Cup.

Sophie Devine returned to form with a composed unbeaten 50 and a crucial bowling contribution as Gujarat Giants secured a commanding 45-run win over UP Warriorz in the Women’s Premier League on Thursday.After being sent in to bat, the Giants recovered from early hiccups to post 153/8, thanks largely to Devine’s calm innings, which included three sixes and two fours off 42 balls. Despite being nearly run out early and dropped on 35 off a no-ball, Devine capitalised in the final over, hitting a couple of sixes off Shikha Pandey to push the total past 150.The Giants’ bowlers then produced a disciplined performance to bundle out the hosts for 108 in just 17.3 overs, ending a three-match losing streak. Veteran left-arm spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad led the attack with 3/16 in her comeback match, while Devine (2/16) and Renuka Singh (2/20) picked up two wickets apiece.UP Warriorz struggled from the outset, losing Kiran Navgire for a golden duck in the first over and seeing skipper Meg Lanning dismissed for 14 early in the powerplay. Phoebe Litchfield offered some resistance with 32, but the Giants’ bowlers kept the pressure on.Gayakwad’s trio of quick wickets reduced UP to 93/7, and Devine wrapped up the tail, dismissing Sophie Ecclestone to leave the hosts at 94/8 inside 16 overs.UPW’s bowlers, led by Kranti Goud’s 2/18, kept Gujarat’s scoring in check through the middle overs, but Devine’s late surge provided a competitive total that proved more than enough. Gujarat’s all-round performance propelled them to second place in the WPL standings, behind Royal Challengers Bengaluru, and ended their three-game slump in emphatic fashion.",Gujarat Giants beat UP Warriorz by 45 runs in Women's Premier League.

- Mendis holds Sri Lanka together -

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's spinners turned the screws to script a hard-fought 19-run victory over England in the opening one-day international at Colombo's R Premadasa Stadium on Thursday.Set 272 for victory, England appeared to be cruising at 129-1 with Ben Duckett and Joe Root stroking the ball sweetly and the asking rate firmly under control.But once the 117-run stand was broken, Sri Lanka dried up the runs and England faltered with the bat, being bowled out for 252 in the final over.""It was a good game of cricket, but we need to keep improving. Our spinners did a terrific job. We knew it would start turning after the 30th over and batting would become a challenge,"" Sri Lanka captain Charith Asalanka said.Duckett's attempted reverse sweep brought Sri Lanka back into the game as he was ruled leg before to Jeffrey Vandersay. However, it was Root's dismissal that truly changed the complexion of the contest.The former England Test captain, a perennial thorn in Sri Lanka's side with imposing averages of 61 in ODIs and 62 in Tests against them, misjudged a sweep off part-time spinner Dhananjaya de Silva.Sri Lanka reviewed instantly, the on-field decision was overturned and the roar from the Premadasa stands said it all.With the required rate climbing north of eight an over, England were forced into risk mode.Harry Brook and Jacob Bethell both paid the price, brilliantly stumped by Kusal Mendis, with Brook undone off a wide by his opposite number Asalanka.Jamie Overton injected late drama with a muscular 34 off 17 balls, adding 39 for the last wicket with Adil Rashid, but it proved too steep a hill to climb and he was the final wicket to fall.Sri Lanka's fielders matched their bowlers stride for stride, with De Silva and Dunith Wellalage pulling off stunning catches to keep the pressure relentless.Earlier, Mendis had been the glue that held Sri Lanka's innings together after England's leg-spin pair of Adil Rashid and Rehan Ahmed reduced the hosts to 124 for four.Battling cramps but showing sharp game awareness, Mendis rotated the strike cleverly and punished anything loose.He added 88 runs for the fifth wicket with Janith Liyanage, who made 46.Mendis was on 92 at the start of the final over and watched from the non-striker's end as Wellalage stole the limelight, launching three fours and a six in a blistering 25 not out from 12 balls as the last over bowled by Overton yielded 23.That proved crucial as it dragged the hosts to 271-6 from their 50 overs.""Sri Lanka outplayed us,"" England captain Harry Brook said.""We thought we could chase it and we were in a good position, but with the asking rate climbing it became difficult. It's hard to start and someone needed to go on and finish the job.""The teams meet again at the same stadium on Saturday for the second game of the three-match series.","England bowled out for 252 in the final over of opening ODI in Colombo.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Pakistan have once again taken a swipe at India, this time through a promotional video released ahead of their upcoming T20I series against Australia, subtly revisiting the much-debated ‘handshake’ controversy.The reference stems from events following the Pahalgam terror attacks, after which Indian players refrained from shaking hands with their Pakistani counterparts during several global tournaments. The issue first came into focus at the Asia Cup 2025, where India and Pakistan faced each other three times. On each occasion, India captain Suryakumar Yadav did not exchange handshakes with Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha, either at the toss or after the conclusion of the matches.Pakistan’s latest promo largely focuses on portraying the country as a warm and welcoming destination for Australian supporters, highlighting local hospitality. Agha himself appears briefly in the video, speaking about how guests are treated in Pakistan.However, the closing sequence has drawn attention and criticism. In the clip, an Australian tourist steps out of a car without shaking hands with the driver.He is then reminded in Hindi-Urdu, “Handshake bhool gaye aap, lagta hai padosiyon ke paas bhi ruke thay” — suggesting he may have picked up the habit from Pakistan’s “neighbours”. The line is widely seen as a direct dig at India and the earlier handshake episode.The controversy around handshakes had previously escalated to the point where Pakistan reportedly threatened to pull out of the Asia Cup midway, following a standoff with the ICC over match referee Andy Pycroft Australia are scheduled to play three T20 Internationals in Lahore as part of their build-up to the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. All three day-night matches will be held at the Gaddafi Stadium on January 29, January 31 and February 1.After the series, both teams will head to the World Cup, with Australia playing their group matches in India, while Pakistan will be based in Sri Lanka. This marks Australia’s first T20 tour of Pakistan since April 2022, when they last visited for a Test series and a white-ball leg.","Pakistan have released a promotional video ahead of their T20 series against Australia.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

On this day — January 22 — 105 years ago, a cricketer was born in Belmont, Port of Spain, in Trinidad. His name was Andrew Gordon Ganteaume, popularly known as Andy Ganteaume Born in 1921, Andy Ganteaume made his first-class debut in the 1940/41 season, representing his home team Trinidad. The wicketkeeper-batter played a total of 50 first-class matches, scoring 2,785 runs at an average of 34.81, with the help of five centuries and 17 fifties. He took 34 catches and had three stumpings to his name as a keeper.It was a decent record, but not a wow-generating career. That moment came in February 1948, when he received his Test cap for the West Indies against England at his home ground in Port of Spain.Ganteaume scored a stunning 112 in his debut innings for the Windies in front of his home fans as an opener, hitting 13 fours. But it turned out to be the then 27-year-old’s one and only Test innings of his cricketing career. He went on to live till his 95th birthday, passing away in February 2016, 68 years after that fateful match in his hometown.That century put him above none other than cricket legend Sir Don Bradman as the batter with the highest batting average in Test history. Bradman famously ended his long and storied career with a batting average of 99.94, after getting out for a duck in his final Test innings.Ganteaume, meanwhile, finished his Test career with an average of 112, thanks to that lone debut knock.Here’s how Andy Ganteaume’s one and only Test match panned out:England captain Gubby Allen won the toss and elected to bat first against the West Indies. Riding on opener Billy Griffith’s century, England reached 230/6 at the end of the opening day. The visitors were bowled out for 362, with Griffith scoring 140 and Jim Laker contributing 55 at No. 9. Wilf Ferguson was the pick of the bowlers for the hosts, returning figures of 5 for 137.Andy Ganteaume came out to bat in his debut innings as an opener and ended Day 2 unbeaten on 52. He, along with opening partner George Carew, who completed his hundred, took West Indies to a commanding 160/0 at stumps.The next day, Carew was dismissed for 107, while Ganteaume made his debut a memorable one with a century, scoring 112. West Indies batted out the entire day and were at 447/6 at stumps, with Frank Worrell missing out on a century after getting out for 97. They held a lead of 85 runs.West Indies failed to increase the lead much after that and were bowled out for 497 on the fourth day — a lead of 135 runs. England went to the stumps on Day 4 at 70/3 ahead of the rest day.On the fifth and final day, opener Jack Robertson scored 133 and set West Indies a target of 141 runs after England posted 275 in their second innings. Ferguson completed his 10-wicket haul in the match, returning figures of 6 for 92 for a return of 11 for 229. West Indies were at 72/3 when the two teams shook hands for a draw.Incidentally, Ganteaume did not come out to bat in the second innings for the hosts, despite opening the innings in the first essay.Why did Ganteaume play only one Test for the West Indies?Despite scoring 112 on debut, Andy Ganteaume never played for the West Indies again. He continued to play for Trinidad till the 1962/63 season but did not feature at the international level thereafter.West Indies had a formidable batting line-up around this time — the era of Walcott, Worrell, Weekes, Sobers, Kanhai, Rae, Stollmeyer and Gomez — and there were suggestions that Ganteaume slowed down when nearing his hundred, possibly costing West Indies a chance of victory. Jeff Stollmeyer later wrote: “Andy’s innings in its later stages was not in keeping with the state of the game and his captain [Gerry Gomez] was forced to send a message out to him to ‘get on with it’. ”But that one match ensured that he ended his Test career with a better average than Don Bradman.Currently, only one batter — Kurtis Robert Patterson of Australia — has a higher Test average, at 144 after playing two Tests. However, Patterson is still active, and until the Australian batter retires from his cricket career, Andy Ganteaume will hold the record of the batter who ended his career with the highest batting average in Test history.","Andy Ganteaume made his Test debut for the West Indies against England in 1948. The wicketkeeper-batter played a total of 50 first-class matches, scoring 2,785 runs at an average of 34.81, with the help of five centuries and 17 fifties. He went on to live till his 95th birthday, passing away in February 2016.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127166915,imgsize-85526,width-400,resizemode-4/mj-66.jpg"

Arshdeep Singh press conference: on adapting to conditions, team roles & bowling plans | IND vs NZ 1st T20I

‘You’ve to take criticism in your stride’

Showering praise on India’s young T20 batting sensation Abhishek Sharma , former India head coach Ravi Shastri has made it clear how much India will bank on the attacking left-hander in the T20 World Cup next month by saying, “If he takes off, India take off.” Abhishek smashed 84 off just 35 balls, in a match-winning innings which was studded with eight sixes, to set up India’s 48-run win over New Zealand in the first T20I at Nagpur on Wednesday night.Asked about which player he thought would dominate the 2026 T20 World Cup tournament, which is set to begin from February 7, Shastri replied at a promotional event of the International Cricket Council here on Thursday, “Abhishek, without a shadow of a doubt. (He’s) the No. 1 T20 batsman in the world and in a rich vein of form. He took the game away from New Zealand last evening. You’ve got to watch out for him because his confidence level is high. He’ll be backed by the home crowd. And if he takes off, it means India take off.”Meanwhile, sitting alongside Shastri, former England batting great Kevin Pietersen said that he felt that Abhishek and South Africa’s batting prodigy Dewald Brevis will be the players who will make the maximum impact in the upcoming T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.Asked about which player he thought would dominate the tournament, Pietersen spelled out Brevis’s name, while going gaga over the 22-year-old’s game in the SA20, during which the ex-England captain was doing commentary duties.“Brevis again played another incredible innings last night. A couple of days ago, I was calling the game in Johannesburg where his team, the Pretoria Capitals, led by (Sourav) Ganguly, was struggling. They were seven for five (in the fifth over) and Brevis went (in) and batted for 15 overs and they got to a winning total of 140 or 150 (143/6). (Now) that’s something Brevis has always come under criticism for, that he’s just a one-trick pony. He stands there and he just tries to hit six after six after six. I said in the commentary that could be the making of Brevis, so from that point of view, he’s in that. Just because I’m seeing him a lot at the moment,” Pietersen said.Showering similar praise on Abhishek, who smashed 84 off just 35 balls to set up India’s 48-run win over New Zealand in the opening T20I at Nagpur on Wednesday night, ‘KP’ remarked, “That kid is a proper star.”“Abhishek Sharma. I mean, my goodness. I remember when Abhishek got that 150 (135 off 54 balls; seven fours, 13 sixes) against England, remember at the Wankhede Stadium last year? We were watching this and (when) he came over and we interviewed him after the game. I just put my hand on his shoulder and I said, ‘Young man, that is the best T20 innings I’ve ever seen in international cricket.’ That kid is a proper star,” ‘KP’ gushed.Asked if he saw Abhishek’s latest special, Pietersen nodded an affirmative. “I saw, I saw. When you know he’s batting, you turn the TV on!”Meanwhile, quizzed on how he reacted to criticism during his tenure as Team India coach — he was in the hot seat from 2014-16, and then from 2016-21 — Shastri said that he “just took it in his stride.”“I prefer criticism that is constructive, and when I became a broadcaster, I said I’ve divorced the dressing room and I will speak on what I see. It doesn’t matter if you were my colleague or you were my friend when I was playing the game. But that’s something you expect. In my tenure, there were good moments and there were rough moments. You just have to take it in your stride because you know there is another game coming up. ”“One day you are in a pole position. The next day you are in a troll position. That can happen. But in a week, you can see all three. You can be in pole, troll, again pole,” he added.","Former India head coach Ravi Shastri has made it clear how much India will bank on the attacking left-hander in the T20 World Cup next month.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: Former India and East Bengal defender Ilyas Pasha died on Thursday after a prolonged illness.He was 61. He is survived by his wife, two daughters, and two sons.The All India Football Federation (AIFF) condoled the death of Pasha, who was one of the best footballers to have come out of Karnataka.A committed and soft-spoken footballer, Pasha carved out a distinguished career in an area of the field that demanded resilience and composure - defence.Primarily operating as a right wing-back, he was renowned for his impeccable sense of timing, calm demeanour, and ability to read the game astutely.Rarely flustered under pressure, Pasha's disciplined positioning and well-judged tackles ensured that opposing left wingers found little joy on his flank, while goalkeepers behind him operated with added confidence.At the international level, Pasha made his senior India debut on January 27, 1987, against Bulgaria in the Nehru Cup at Kozhikode.He went on to earn eight international caps, featuring in two editions of the Nehru Cup (1987 and 1991), the 1991 SAF Games, and the 1992 Asian Cup qualifiers.Pasha began his football journey with Vinayaka Football Club, Vyalikaval, in north Bengaluru, where he also resided.His consistent performances soon earned him a move to Indian Telephone Industries in the mid-1980s, a period that marked his emergence at the national level.From 1987 onwards, he became a regular feature for Karnataka in the Santosh Trophy , representing the state at the tournaments held in Kolkata in 1987, Quilon (now Kollam) in 1988, and Guwahati in 1989.His performance in Guwahati stood out, as Karnataka narrowly missed out on a final berth. He also won two Santosh Trophy titles with Bengal in 1993 and 1995.On the back of his domestic exploits, Pasha was signed by Mohammedan Sporting, where he continued to enhance his reputation, winning the Sait Nagjee Trophy and the Nizam Gold Cup in 1989.He later joined East Bengal, a move that ushered in the most defining phase of his club career. Representing the iconic red and gold from the early 1990s through the end of the decade, Pasha became an integral part of one of the club's most successful eras.He captained East Bengal during the 1993-94 season and was a trusted figure under the late coach Subhas Bhowmick.With the Red and Gold Brigade, he won the Calcutta Football League on five occasions (1991, 1993, 1995, 1996 and 1998), the IFA Shield five times (1990, 1991, 1994, 1995 and 1997), and the Durand Cup four times (1990, 1991, 1993 and 1995).His trophy cabinet also included two Rovers Cups (1990, 1994), the Federation Cup (1996), the historic Wai Wai Cup in Kathmandu (1993), Airlines Trophy titles in 1990, 1992, 1995 and 1997, the Bordoloi Trophy (1992), ATPA Shield (1992), Kalinga Cup (1993), McDowell Trophy (1995, 1997), and the Super Cup in the 1996-97 season.He was also a member of East Bengal's celebrated triple crown-winning side in 1990 and captained the team to its first international title at the Wai Wai Cup in 1993.He also wore the captain's armband when East Bengal registered a sensational 6-2 victory over Iraq's Al Zawraa SC in the 1993-94 Asian Cup Winners' Cup.He got a special Lifetime Achievement Award from East Bengal in 2012.The AIFF said it has joined the Indian football fraternity in mourning the loss of Pasha, a defender of rare composure and consistency, to honour his lasting contributions to the game.In Kolkata, the East Bengal flag was kept at half-mast on the day, while the club's Under-16 team observed a minute's silence before training.Former East Bengal skipper Falguni Dutta, who played alongside Pasha for two years, remembered him fondly. ""I came to know early in the morning. I was shocked.""When I came to the club in 1997, I was a raw talent and he was there to guide me as a mentor. He played in the same position as me, but I never saw any jealousy in him. He was like an elder brother -- a guide and a coach. He inspired us,"" Dutta said.East Bengal Club bid a final farewell to Pasha at his Bengaluru residence.Working committee member Dipten Bose paid his respects, while former players Saravanan, Thomas and Feroz were also present.","Former India and East Bengal defender Ilyas Pasha dies at 61. Pasha was renowned for his impeccable sense of timing, calm demeanour, and ability to read the game astutely.

From Rs 275 crore to bare bones: AIFF faces a tough test to sell ISL broadcast rights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/news/from-rs-275-crore-to-bare-bones-aiff-faces-a-tough-test-to-sell-isl-broadcast-rights/articleshow/127128213.cms,"With no takers for its first tender, the AIFF is scrambling to find a broadcaster for ISL 2025–26.

Time for recalibration

What does the current RFP say?

Poll What is your opinion on the AIFF's decision to issue a second Request for Proposal for ISL broadcast rights? It's a necessary step for improvement It shows a lack of planning It's too late to make a difference I have no opinion on this

Last week, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) floated a Request for Proposal (RFP) tender looking for a broadcast partner for the 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season. This was the second time in six months that the AIFF had issued such a document as the first version, released in October 2025, demanded an annual minimum guarantee of Rs 37.5 crore. For a variety of reasons, that didn't find any takers.Ever since, Indian football is in a free fall.AIFF's deal with Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), which had started the ISL in 2014, expired on December 8, 2025. Between AIFF Constitutional changes, court visits, lack of commercial partners and eventual intervention by the Sports Ministry, ISL has taken a massive hit to its credibility, even if it now has a start date in February 14.The fixtures for ISL 2025-26, which have been tucked away in the draft folder for days due to home venues being in shambles, add to the challenge for any prospective broadcast bidder(s).With 91 matches to be played in the upcoming truncated season in a single leg home-and-away format, this race against time only gets trickier with each passing day. The fact that AIFF have not officially appointed an agency to oversee the broadcast bids process doesn't bode well either.In 2021, the BCCI brought in audit, tax and financial advisory consultants KPMG to advise them on the media rights sale for the IPL. The objective was clear: earn 'top dollar.' It resulted in media rights for the IPL going at Rs 48,390.32 crore over five years - a 100 percent jump in value per match.AIFF, which has hardly showcased its competence in the past few months, is alone in this regard. Before FSDL stepped away, the ISL had a broadcast deal worth Rs 550 crore over two seasons with games showcased on linear TV and OTT. At first, ISL matches were broadcast on the Star Sports Network before moving to the Viacom18-owned Sports18/JioCinema.The Rs 275 crore-a-year deal was reportedly a 37.5 percent increase on what Star India, who had a majority stake in the ISL, had been paying in the first 10 years of the competition.This Rs 275 crore funded things such as match production, league marketing, revenue for the clubs and fixed payments to the federation. Despite this, FSDL posted losses of Rs 14.34 crore in FY23, Rs 46.3 crore in FY22, Rs 13.7 crore in FY21 and Rs 27 crore in FY20. The league only turned profitable when operations were scaled down, posting a net profit of Rs 45.2 crore in FY24.Now, in this post-FSDL era, AIFF and, by extension, the ISL clubs have little room to negotiate with any potential bidders. With the ISL set to be played in multiple cities, it adds to the costs involved with only Rs 9.77 crore budgeted for Production and Transmission. In the past, it hovered around Rs 70 crores.It means the quality output of the broadcast will be lower. Instead of multi-camera setups in different parts of the ground, one can expect 3-4 cameras, similar to the I-League coverage where equipment is placed at a high vantage point, behind the goal and near the half-way line.An ISL club official, who spoke to TimesofIndia.com on the condition of anonymity, said that organising the league in multiple cities could dissuade potential bidders. He also reminded that options are limited anyway, as February-March is also the period for the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, which JioStar will broadcast.The logic is simple: higher viewership means higher sponsorship for clubs and with an inferior product, that Rs 5-6 crore piece of the puzzle is going to take a hit. All clubs are braced for another year of red in their balance sheet. Even though many will cut costs operationally and have reduced player wages, the losses are expected to be three times the normal in the absence of commercial revenue.Like other aspects of the ISL including franchise fees and player salaries, the broadcast rights value also needs to be recalibrated for a healthier future. While this upcoming season can largely be logged as a stop-gap solution-finding exercise, the exercise towards an economically viable product needs to begin now. As ICC and BCCI have found out, mindless pricing of broadcast deals will drive away smaller players in the streaming space. And unlike sports like cricket and kabaddi - whose audience still consumes coverage on linear TV - football's young viewership exists on OTT.Subsequently, if players stay away due to pricing, it will further dwindle AIFF's options. Among the major broadcast players - on linear TV and digital - there are few options outside of JioStar and Sony Sports Network.AIFF's RFP for media rights of the ISL is a 39-page document that lays down the detailed eligibility framework for prospective bidders and specifies the timelines for bids to be submitted, examined and assessed.As per the schedule, the AIFF has fixed January 23 for a pre-bid meeting with interested parties, while any written queries or requests for clarification may be addressed by up to January 27.Bids must be submitted no later than 5:00 pm IST on February 1, with each submission accompanied by a security deposit of Rs. 5 lakh.Eligibility conditions require bidders to be broadcasters or internet operators with a minimum of three years’ operational experience.In addition, bidders must have recorded a net worth of at least Rs. 10 crore in the most recent financial year (2024–25) and an average annual revenue of no less than Rs. 10 crore across the last three completed financial years — 2022–23, 2023–24 and 2024–25.In the case of consortium bids, a maximum of three entities may come together under a special purpose vehicle (SPV). One member must be designated as the ‘Lead member’ and hold at least a 51 percent equity stake in the SPV’s paid-up and subscribed share capital.Each bid will be evaluated in two components — Technical and Financial — carrying weightages of 70 percent and 30 percent respectively. The bidder securing the highest overall score will be awarded the rights for the forthcoming season.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) floated a Request for Proposal (RFP) tender looking for a broadcast partner for the 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season.

'I completely understand the booing': Kylian Mbappé responds to fans’ treatment of Vinícius Júnior,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/i-completely-understand-the-booing-kylian-mbapp-responds-to-fans-treatment-of-vincius-jnior/articleshow/126704155.cms,"Kylian Mbappé of Real Madrid celebrates (Photo by Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty Images)

A tough week

Kylian Mbappé criticized Real Madrid fans for singling out Vinícius Júnior and booing the star forward in the team's Spanish league match on Saturday.Mbappé said fans are entitled to boo when they are unhappy, but should criticize the whole squad and not specific players.“I understand the fans,” Mbappé said Monday ahead of the team's Champions League game against Monaco on Tuesday.“Before I was a player, I was a young guy who watched football, was critical and gave his opinion. I completely understand the booing, but if they're going to do it, they should boo the whole squad, not just a few players. We're all playing poorly.”Madrid beat Levante 2-0 on Saturday to end a slide in form that included a loss to Barcelona in the final of the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia last weekend and an embarrassing elimination against second-division club Albacete in the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday.The crowd at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on Saturday jeered loudly when Vinícius' name was announced before the match against Levante, and again nearly every time the Brazil forward touched the ball.“It's not Vini's fault we're not playing as well as we'd like. The whole squad is to blame,” Mbappé said. “That's the only thing I have to say to the fans. Boo the whole squad. We have to turn the situation around. We're all to blame.We're going to do just that because we're Real Madrid players and there are always moments like this.Mbappé said Vinícius was affected by the boos and said the whole squad had to try to support him.“Vini is a human being,” Mbappé said. “It's normal to be affected when people speak negatively about you. Sometimes it's fair, sometimes it's not. Vini is a fantastic player. He's an incredible man. I'm lucky to know him, and I'm very fond of him. We as a team have to protect him better so he's not in this position of being alone against everyone. We're going to protect him so he can give us his best, because when he's at his best, he's one of the best in the world. ”The fans also booed Jude Bellingham and Federico Valverde on Saturday. The trio was considered by many to be among those who were not behind former coach Xabi Alonso, who was fired following the team's loss to Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup. Alonso was replaced by former B-team coach Álvaro Arbeloa.Mbappé said he spoke with Alonso after his departure and wished him well.“I had a wonderful relationship with him. I wish him all the best because I liked how he viewed the game,” Mbappé said.“He's a coach who's obsessed with the game and the details, and he knows a lot about modern soccer. It's a decision by the club that we have to respect. Now there's a new coach, and we have to support him. We're going to give it our all to ensure things go well for both Arbeloa and Real Madrid.”Mbappé was among the players telling Alonso that they would not do the guard of honor to Barcelona in the awards ceremony at the Spanish Super Cup, an image many said showed a break between Alonso and the players in the locker room.“I'm not going to play dumb,” Mbappé said. “Of course, things go on. There are a lot of things said that ultimately aren't true. I don't think that's right. Our job is to accept it, but when I have the opportunity to speak out, I do so. We have to keep quiet and do our talking on the pitch.”Mbappé said it “hasn't been an easy week” for Madrid and the match against Monaco could prove to be a turning point.“We have to show our character to change these kinds of circumstances and to get everyone back on side,” he said.“I think the fans are eager to give us their support, but we have to earn it. We have to keep fighting for all the titles, and tomorrow the most important thing is the Champions League. We're going to show as a team that we can compete and that we're ready to win all the titles we have left this season.”Madrid sits in seventh place in the league phase of the Champions League. The club trails Barcelona by a point in the Spanish league.","Kylian Mbappé says Real Madrid fans are entitled to boo when they are unhappy.

Senegal fans tried to enter the field. They clashed with security staff. The match was stopped for almost 20 minutes.Eventually, play resumed. Diaz stepped up to take the penalty.

In the fourth minute, Pape Gueye scored a brilliant goal.It was the only goal of the match. Senegal won 1-0 and lifted the trophy.""We had a feeling of injustice. Just before the penalty we thought we should have had a goal and the referee didn't go to VAR,"" said Villarreal midfielder Gueye. ""Sadio told us to come back on and we remobilised. Edouard then made the save, we stayed focused, got the goal and won the game.""Senegal coach Pape Thiaw admitted fault. ""After thinking about it, I realised that I shouldn't have asked them to go off. I apologise for that,"" Thiaw told French broadcaster beIN Sports.""Sometimes you can react in the heat of the moment. Before that we scored a goal that was not given. But now we accept that referees do make mistakes and we apologise.""This was Senegal’s second AFCON title. Their first came four years ago in Cameroon.

LONDON: Aston Villa's Premier League title challenge suffered a huge blow in a 1-0 defeat against Everton, while Newcastle's push towards the top four was derailed by a 0-0 draw at Wolves on Sunday.Unai Emery's side could have closed to within four points of leaders Arsenal if they had beaten Everton at Villa Park.But they wasted the chance to put pressure on the Gunners with a limp performance that was punished by Thierno Barry's second-half winner.After Arsenal's goalless draw at Nottingham Forest on Saturday, Mikel Arteta's men are seven points clear of third-placed Villa.Second-placed Manchester City are also seven points behind the leaders following their 2-0 loss at Manchester United on Saturday.Arsenal are chasing a first English title since 2004 and the stumbles from City and Villa this weekend have tightened their grip on the title race.""There are other teams with more potential than us,"" Emery said of Villa's fading title chances.""We lost a very good opportunity. We did a very good season until now, but today we lost.""We had our chances, we didn't score and they had less chances, but they scored.""Adding to Villa's woes, their captain John McGinn limped off with a first-half injury.Villa had won their previous 11 home games in all competitions.But Everton's Merlin Rohl nearly shattered that feeling of invincibility in just 11 seconds when he capitalised on sloppy defending to shoot against the post.Despite being a boyhood Villa fan, Everton winger Jack Grealish was loudly jeered on his return to his former club.Grealish almost silenced his tormentors with a goal-bound volley that was blocked by Evann Guessand.Everton's Jake O'Brien headed home from a corner, only to see his effort disallowed for offside against Harrison Armstrong.Villa went close just before half-time when Youri Tielemans's cross picked out Guessand and the Ivory Coast forward looped his header onto the bar.But Emery's men lacked a cutting edge and they paid the price in the 59th minute.- Newcastle frustrated -It was a shambolic goal to concede as Pau Torres carelessly surrendered possession just outside his own area.Dwight McNeil pounced with a shot that Emiliano Martinez pushed out to Barry and the striker chipped the ball into the net from close range for his third goal in his last five appearances.Goalkeeper Jordan Pickford preserved Everton's victory with a brilliant tip-over from Morgan Rogers's curler, leaving Villa with only one win from their last four league games.At rain-lashed Molineux, Eddie Howe's Newcastle were unable to prise open the Wolves defence as two points slipped away.Wins over Burnley, Crystal Palace and Leeds had bolstered their bid to qualify for next season's Champions League.But the Magpies are stuck in eighth place after failing to beat bottom-of-the-table Wolves.Following their disappointing 2-0 defeat against Manchester City in the League Cup semi-final first leg on Tuesday, it was another frustrating result for Newcastle.""We needed to do more in attack. I expected us to do better and create more,"" Howe said after Newcastle took 85 minutes to muster a shot on target.""Football is such a strange game.

Former Eagles lineman Kevin Johnson cause of death revealed



Kevin Johnson, a former NFL defensive lineman known for his time with the Philadelphia Eagles, has died at 55, leaving fans and former teammates shocked. His life after football was far from the spotlight, and recent developments surrounding his death have raised serious questions.Once celebrated for his strength and agility on the gridiron, Johnson transitioned from NFL stardom to a quieter, more challenging life off the field. Friends and family remember a man who faced hardship in his later years, yet remained a beloved figure to those who knew him.Kevin Johnson was found dead near a homeless encampment in Los Angeles, according to local authorities. The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office listed his cause of death as blunt head trauma and stab wounds. Police are investigating the incident as a homicide, with Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Lt. Steve De Jong confirming, “Unfortunately, it appears he was homeless. It looks like he was probably living there. ”Johnson’s career in professional football began at Los Angeles Harbor College and later at Texas Southern University, where he made a name for himself as a formidable defensive tackle. He was selected by the New England Patriots in the fourth round of the 1993 NFL Draft but never played a regular-season game for them.His NFL debut came with the Eagles in 1995, where he recorded six sacks, 19 tackles, and returned a fumble for a touchdown in just 11 games.He continued with the Eagles in 1996 and later joined the Oakland Raiders for the 1997 season. Johnson then played in the Arena Football League, winning a championship with the Orlando Predators in 1998. One high school friend shared on social media, “The enemy had a tight hold on you with addiction and I had to walk away. We hadn't talked since 2019 though you've tried to reach out but all I could do is pray from a distance. ”Authorities are continuing their investigation into Johnson’s death. Meanwhile, friends, family, and fans mourn the loss of a man whose life was defined both by athletic excellence and personal challenges, reminding everyone of the fragile nature of life beyond the game.","Kevin Johnson was found dead near a homeless encampment in Los Angeles.

Josh Allen’s influence on the Bills head coach search



Josh Allen sits at the center of every serious conversation inside One Bills Drive right now. The franchise quarterback is not just the face of the Buffalo Bills. He is the standard, the selling point, and the reason this head coaching vacancy feels different from most across the league.Buffalo is coming off another playoff run that ended short of its ultimate goal, and that reality forced ownership to make a difficult call on Sean McDermott. The Bills are still a Super Bowl-level team. They have stability at quarterback, a proven core, and a fan base that expects more than regular-season success. What they need is the right leader who can unlock the final level with Allen at the controls.Allen’s voice in the process is no longer speculation. ESPN insider Peter Schrager made it clear just how involved the quarterback will be as the Bills shape their future.“Josh Allen is going to play a major role in not only consulting, but selecting the next head coach of the Buffalo Bills.”That statement aligns with what owner Terry Pegula hinted earlier this week when he confirmed Allen would assist during the search. For a franchise quarterback who has carried Buffalo to the postseason year after year, this level of involvement signals trust and urgency. The Bills are no longer experimenting.They are aligning leadership directly with their most valuable asset.The logic is simple. Allen thrives when the offense is aggressive, creative, and built around his instincts. That is why names like Brian Daboll naturally surface. Daboll knows Allen’s strengths better than almost anyone, having helped shape his rise from raw talent to MVP. Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady also remains a strong internal option, offering continuity and a modern approach that keeps Allen comfortable and confident.Buffalo is casting a wide net, though. On Thursday, the team confirmed another interview as it explores different philosophies.“We have completed an interview with Indianapolis Colts DC Lou Anarumo for our head coaching position,” the team wrote on their official X.Anarumo brings defensive credibility from his time with Cincinnati and Indianapolis, while Daboll and Brady represent offensive familiarity. The common thread is Allen. Whoever earns this job must connect with him, challenge him, and maximize his prime years.This search is not just about hiring a coach. It is about empowering a superstar quarterback to finally take Buffalo where it has been chasing for decades.","Buffalo Bills have interviewed Indianapolis Colts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo. Bills quarterback Josh Allen is expected to have a major role in the search for a new head coach. The Bills are still a Super Bowl-level team, but they need a leader who can unlock the final level.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127219887,imgsize-53222,width-400,resizemode-4/josh-allen.jpg"

Jesse Minter Ravens head coach era begins with trust and expectation



Jesse Minter is now confirmed as the new Ravens head coach and quickly it became the hot storyline across the NFL on Thursday, and it did not take long for old voices to re-enter the conversation. As Baltimore charted a new path after a rare coaching reset, past remarks from an unexpected place added texture to a move that already carried league-wide weight.For the first time since 2008, the Ravens stepped into unfamiliar territory by naming a new head coach. The decision closed the chapter on John Harbaugh’s long and stable era and opened one built on urgency, evolution, and belief in a rising defensive mind who knows the building well.Baltimore confirmed it had reached an agreement with Jesse Minter, the Los Angeles Chargers’ defensive coordinator, signaling a clear shift toward modern defensive innovation. Minter, 42, previously served as an assistant coach from 2017 to 2020 on Harbaugh’s staff, making his return feel calculated rather than risky. In his first words as head coach, Minter said, ""I am truly honored to serve as the head coach of the Baltimore Ravens,"" adding, ""This is an organization whose values, culture and tradition of excellence reflect everything I believe about the game of football and how it should be played.The hire gained momentum fast because Jesse Minter’s recent work spoke louder than résumés ever could. Under Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh, he transformed a struggling defense into the league’s stingiest unit. Los Angeles allowed the fewest points in the NFL in 2024, a sharp turnaround from a bottom-tier ranking the season before. The Chargers also finished ninth in scoring defense and fifth in yards allowed, proof of a system that adapts and attacks.That surge made Minter one of the most sought-after names of the offseason. Nine teams with vacancies requested interviews, and Baltimore moved decisively after meeting him on Wednesday. By Thursday morning, Minter had withdrawn from Cleveland’s search, clearing the runway for a deal after the Ravens interviewed 16 candidates.As the news settled, social media unearthed comments from Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce , who faced Minter’s defenses twice each season. On the New Heights podcast, Kelce said, ""And to be honest, that dude he has got [explicative] figured out,"" before detailing a surprise blitz that caught the Chiefs off guard. He added, ""Shout out to Jesse, he's absolutely killing it. Coach Minter, couldn't be more proud to say that I was once your scout team quarterback.""That final line hinted at a deeper link. Minter served as a graduate assistant at Cincinnati during Kelce’s freshman year, a connection that now feels prophetic. In Baltimore, Minter inherits Lamar Jackson, a roster loaded with six Pro Bowl selections, and a franchise eager to return to its winning standard. Expectations are high, and this time, even opponents are already nodding in respect.","Jesse Minter, the Los Angeles Chargers' defensive coordinator, has been confirmed as the new Ravens head coach.

Caleb Williams dating rumors collide with Josh Jacobs beach video



Caleb Williams dating chatter took a sharp and unexpected turn this week, flipping a month of fan theories on their head. What once looked like a quiet off-field connection involving the Chicago Bears quarterback now appears to point firmly in a different direction. New social media clues have shifted the spotlight away from Williams and toward a familiar rival in green and gold, adding fresh fuel to one of the NFL’s most heated rivalries.The buzz picked up speed after fans noticed new details that contradicted earlier assumptions. What started as harmless speculation quickly became a full-blown online investigation, blending celebrity culture, football fandom, and rivalry-driven humor. The timing only made it louder, especially after Williams already had his say against Green Bay where it mattered most, on the field.For weeks, fans believed influencer and model Ash Kaashh, whose real name is Ashaley, was linked to Williams. She was spotted at a December Bears game wearing a head-turning fur outfit and even flashed the Bear claw gesture, which many took as a public show of support. The visuals were convincing, and the story spread fast across social platforms.That momentum slowed when Ashaley skipped Chicago’s winter chill for a tropical birthday getaway. The real twist arrived soon after. A video surfaced on Green Bay Packers running back Josh Jacobs’ Snapchat showing him strolling along a beach, hand in hand with a mystery woman. Internet sleuths quickly identified her as Ashaley, confirming she was not alone on the trip.The imagery did not stop there. Jacobs added heart hands emojis, a subtle but clear signal that spoke louder than any caption. Ashaley followed up with beachside photos, including a striking purple swimsuit post that kept fans talking. Together, the posts painted a picture that left little room for doubt.Packers fans embraced the moment with predictable enthusiasm, enjoying a rare off-field win over Chicago. Bears fans, meanwhile, leaned on humor and shrugged it off, pointing out that Williams already delivered his response during the season. Jacobs, known for guarding his private life, suddenly found himself at the center of viral attention.In the end, this saga proves one thing. The Bears-Packers rivalry never sleeps. Even when the helmets come off, the drama finds a way to keep score.","Caleb Williams dating chatter took a sharp and unexpected turn this week.

“Going to wear a dress”: Super Bowl halftime controversy grows as Bad Bunny plans a performance meant to provoke,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/going-to-wear-a-dress-super-bowl-halftime-controversy-grows-as-bad-bunny-plans-a-performance-meant-to-provoke/articleshow/127207290.cms,"Super Bowl halftime controversy is building as Bad Bunny prepares a performance designed to challenge expectations. Reports say the artist plans a bold fashion statement tied to Puerto Rican queer history, sparking political backlash before kickoff. Insiders insist the choice is intentional, not shock value, and that the NFL is bracing for a polarizing moment on its biggest stage yet.

Inside the Super Bowl halftime decision that has already split the NFL audience

The Super Bowl halftime show has always been about spectacle, but this year, the conversation is shifting before a single note is played. With anticipation building around Super Bowl LX, the NFL now finds itself bracing for a cultural moment that promises to stretch far beyond music. At the center of it is Bad Bunny , an artist known as much for intention as for impact.Sources close to the production say this performance will not follow tradition. Instead, it aims to confront it. What is being prepared is not shock for shock’s sake, but a deliberate statement tied to history, identity, and visibility. League executives may see a halftime show. Others see something closer to a manifesto, delivered live on one of the world’s biggest stages.As reactions ripple across political and cultural lines, those involved insist the direction has been clear from the start. The decision, they say, was never spontaneous. It was planned, shaped, and locked in early, even as outside pressure grew louder.According to people involved in the creative process, Bad Bunny plans to wear a dress during the halftime show as a tribute to Puerto Rican queer icons and the long legacy of drag as resistance. A stylist connected to the project described the moment in blunt terms.""He loves controversy. He lives to push envelopes,"" the stylist said.""He is 100 percent going to wear a dress. A political thunderbolt disguised as couture.""Another source from the glam team suggested that the full scope of the performance has yet to register with the league. ""He's not playing it safe. The NFL has no idea what's coming. Zero,"" the source noted.Despite backlash from conservative voices following his selection, those close to the artist say nothing has changed behind the scenes. ""Let them complain. The dress is already being sewn,"" a friend added.Bad Bunny addressed the reaction publicly during an appearance on Saturday Night Live, choosing humor first. ""You might not know this, but I'm doing the Super Bowl Halftime Show. And I'm very happy, and I think everybody's happy about it... even Fox News,"" he said.Bad Bunny later struck a more earnest tone. ""I'm really excited to be doing the Super Bowl, I know that people all around the world who love my music are also happy,"" he added.As Super Bowl LX approaches, the halftime show is no longer just a performance. It is a statement waiting for kickoff.","Bad Bunny plans to wear a dress during the halftime show as a tribute to Puerto Rican queer icons and the long legacy of drag as resistance.

Drake Maye wakes up this week carrying the weight of New England’s past and the promise of its future. On Sunday, the 23-year-old quarterback steps into the AFC Championship with a Super Bowl berth on the line, facing the Denver Broncos in a game that already feels historic. It is the Patriots’ first real shot at returning to the big stage since 2019, and this time, the story belongs to a new leader.The stage is familiar, yet strange. A win in Denver would send New England back to the Super Bowl against a backdrop that connects old eras to new ones. Maye will line up opposite Jarrett Stidham, once a teammate of Tom Brady during that final championship season, now thrust into action after Bo Nix’s injury. The moment is heavy, but Maye has looked built for it all season.Drake Maye’s rise has been fast and convincing. In just his second year, he delivered an MVP-level campaign, throwing for 4,394 yards with 31 touchdowns and only eight interceptions. He led the league in passer rating at 113.5 and completed 72 percent of his throws, guiding the Patriots to an AFC East title and a deep playoff run. Those numbers earned him a finalist spot for the AP Most Valuable Player award and the respect of a fan base hungry for stability after years of searching.While Maye has been rewriting expectations on Sundays, his wife Ann Michael has quietly built her own spotlight. Patriots fans know her from TikTok, where her cooking videos often steal attention, and from the bold game-day outfits that light up timelines. From sparkly pants in the Wild Card round to a custom Drake sweatshirt during the divisional win, she has turned support into style.Earlier this week, she flashed her oversized ring during a cooking clip, then followed it up by making Maye a high-protein chicken salad, dressed in a shoelace-strap workout look that drew instant buzz. It was casual, confident, and very on brand for someone who understands the moment without forcing it.Their story runs deeper than the cameras. Both attended North Carolina, where Maye starred for the Tar Heels and Ann Michael’s brother Tad shared the quarterback room. They married on June 21 back home in North Carolina. Now, as New England’s season balances on one game, Ann Michael stands as his loudest supporter, ready to bring the heat to Mile High Stadium while Drake Maye chases football immortality.","Drake Maye and wife Ann Michael married in June in North Carolina.

Chloe Kim’s father’s uncomfortable reaction to Myles Garrett’s public kiss sparks viral reactions from fans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/chloe-kims-fathers-uncomfortable-reaction-to-myles-garretts-public-kiss-sparks-viral-reactions-from-fans/articleshow/127155062.cms,"Myles Garrett went viral off the field after kissing girlfriend Chloe Kim during a Browns game. Cameras caught her father, Jong Jin Kim, visibly cringing, sparking online debate about public affection and cultural norms. The moment briefly overshadowed Garrett’s historic sack chase and fueled widespread social media reaction.

Fans can’t stop talking about Chloe Kim’s dad after Myles Garrett’s kiss

The NFL rarely pauses for personal moments, but sometimes a few seconds off the field can steal the spotlight from everything else. On a cold November afternoon, with sacks and standings fading into the background, one small gesture involving Myles Garrett and Chloe Kim turned into an unexpected viral moment that had nothing to do with football.Garrett has been dominating headlines all season for his historic push toward the NFL single-season sack record. Yet it was a brief sideline interaction that caught the internet’s attention. Cameras caught Garrett kissing Kim in the stands during Cleveland’s game against Cincinnati. What followed was not boos or cheers, but a quiet reaction that said everything without a single word.Standing just feet away was Kim’s father, Jong Jin Kim, who turned around, shook his head, and placed his palm on his forehead. The gesture spread fast across social media. For many fans, it was both awkward and oddly relatable. Kim’s parents immigrated from South Korea, where public displays of affection are often viewed as uncomfortable rather than romantic. That context added a layer most viewers did not expect.The timing only amplified the moment. Garrett, 29, is one sack away from matching the NFL record of 22.5, chasing names like T.J.Watt and Michael Strahan. On a struggling Browns team, he has remained a rare bright spot and a strong Defensive Player of the Year candidate. Off the field, his relationship with Kim has steadily drawn attention since the two were first spotted together at the Crunchyroll Anime Awards in Tokyo earlier this year.Fans have seen Kim cheering from the stands, racing Garrett playfully on the field, and supporting him quietly throughout the season. Still, this moment struck differently. It blended sports, culture, and family in a way that felt unscripted.The internet, of course, had fun with it. Comparisons flew. Some joked about other viral sports moments, including Shohei Ohtani famously kissing his puppy instead of his wife after an MVP win. Others laughed that Garrett at least avoided leaning into his action-hero persona by saying, ""Hasta la vista, baby!""The clip continues to circulate because it feels real. No branding. No performance. Just a fleeting second where elite sports collided with everyday human reactions.","Cleveland Browns star Myles Garrett kissed girlfriend Chloe Kim in the stands.

Brief Scores



MI Cape Town:

Sunrisers Eastern Cape:

Sunrisers Eastern Cape delivered a commanding performance that not only secured the two-time champions’ place at the top of the SA20 table but also dashed MI Cape Town’s Season 4 playoff aspirations, edging them out by seven wickets in a thrilling contest at St George’s Park on Sunday.MI Cape Town required a bonus-point victory to stay in contention, but now the final playoff place on offer will be a straight shootout between Joburg Super Kings and Durban’s Super Giants.DSG’s hopes hinge on JSK losing to Paarl Royals at Boland Park on Monday. A victory for JSK will see DSG eliminated.The Royals can still overtake the Sunrisers at the top of the table should they beat JSK, but Adrian Birrell’s side have secured their place in Qualifier 1 at Kingsmead on Wednesday, as they can no longer finish outside the top two in the final Betway SA20 standings.The seven-wicket victory was the perfect send-off for the Orange Army, as the unofficial 12th man once again turned out in their thousands for the fifth game in succession to support the local team.They were not disappointed, with new Australian import Chris Green delivering an excellent performance with the ball on his Sunrisers debut. The off-spinner, who was born in South Africa, made the most of the spin-friendly conditions to finish with figures of 3/29.He was ably supported by fellow off-spinner James Coles (1/17) as the Sunrisers limited MI Cape Town to 148/6.Reeza Hendricks was the cornerstone of MI Cape Town’s innings with an unbeaten 70 (44 balls, 8x4, 1x6), while George Linde struck a quickfire 30 off 17 balls (4x6), but they needed much more to push for a bonus-point win.Sunrisers’ chase once again revolved around Quinton de Kock (56 off 49 balls, 6x4, 2x6), with the in-form opener sharing a 109-run partnership for the second wicket with Matthew Breetzke (66 off 55 balls, 8x4).Both departed with victory in sight, creating tension around the ground, but Jordan Hermann held his nerve to hit the winning runs off the penultimate ball of the match and send St George’s Park into seventh heaven.148 for 6 in 20 overs (Reeza Hendricks 70 not out, George Linde 30; Cameron Green 3/29)149 for 3 in 19.5 overs (Matthew Breetzke 66, Quinton de Kock 56; Corbin Bosch 2-29)",Sunrisers Eastern Cape beat MI Cape Town by seven wickets at St George's Park. Victory secures two-time champions' place at the top of the SA20 table.

NEW DELHI: India suffered a historic home series defeat to New Zealand as Virat Kohli ’s brilliant 124 off 108 balls proved insufficient in the third ODI at Holkar Stadium on Sunday.Chasing a challenging target of 338, India was bowled out for 296 in 46 overs, marking the first-ever bilateral ODI series loss to the Kiwis on home soil.Kohli’s innings was a masterclass in controlled aggression and resilience, as he fought hard to keep India in the chase while wickets fell regularly at the other end.Earlier, New Zealand posted a competitive 337 for eight, powered by centuries from Daryl Mitchell (137) and Glenn Phillips (106). The pair stitched together a 219-run fourth-wicket partnership that turned the game decisively in New Zealand’s favour.Mitchell anchored the innings with calm authority, while Phillips provided momentum after a cautious start.Despite early blows from India’s pace attack, including Arshdeep Singh dismissing Henry Nicholls for a duck and Harshit Rana claiming key wickets, New Zealand recovered strongly, rotating the strike and punishing loose deliveries to build a formidable total.India’s chase began shakily, with Rohit Sharma falling for 11 and Shubman Gill for 23 inside seven overs. Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul also failed to make an impact, leaving India at 71 for four.Kohli then rebuilt the innings alongside Nitish Kumar Reddy (53), rotating the strike intelligently and punishing loose deliveries.Harshit Rana contributed a lively 52 off 43 balls, briefly reviving India’s hopes, but the required rate proved too steep.Kohli’s dismissal at 292 for nine, caught by Daryl Mitchell off Kristian Clarke, sealed India’s fate.New Zealand celebrated a landmark 2-1 series win, showcasing composure, power, and effective partnerships.For India, Kohli’s brilliant century drew a standing ovation, but the loss underscored that even individual brilliance could not compensate for a collective batting collapse.The match was remembered as a night where one player’s heroics were not enough to avert a historic defeat.","India bowled out for 296 in 46 overs in third ODI against New Zealand.

NEW DELHI: Delhi cricketer Ayush Badoni feels that taking up bowling a couple of years ago proved to be a turning point in his career, helping him evolve into an all-rounder and earn his maiden India call-up. The 26-year-old was added to India’s ODI squad for the ongoing three-match series against New Zealand after Washington Sundar was ruled out with an injury following the opening ODI.The series is currently locked at 1-1, with the decider scheduled to be played at the Holkar Stadium in Indore on Sunday. While Badoni did not feature in the playing XI for the second ODI, which India lost, he will be hopeful of getting an opportunity, especially given his recent form, to make an impact at the international level.“I was with the Delhi team, I was captain there and our next day match was the quarter-finals against Vidarbha. That’s when I got to know about it. Priyansh was my roommate, so I told him that this could happen and I’ll be going, so maybe you’ll be the captain. That was a great feeling and I feel very grateful and happy that I got this opportunity,” Badoni said while speaking about his selection in a video shared by bcci.tv.Sharing how his family and close friends found out about the call-up, Badoni said, “I got a call late at night, so I couldn’t tell them.It was announced in the morning, that’s when they got to know and they were also very happy and proud. All the coaches and the players were very welcoming to me and I really liked it. I’ve played with and against most of them so it was nice to meet everyone again.”Badoni also spoke about how expanding his skill set over the past two years played a key role in his selection.“Preparation was very clear. Earlier, I used to bat, but since the last two years, I’ve been focusing a lot on my bowling. I always feel that I can take wickets and contribute to the team with my bowling. So I got the benefit of being an all-rounder. I’ve bowled a lot for Delhi, taken wickets, and benefited from it.”Reflecting on sharing the dressing room with senior players, Badoni said he has previously played with or against many of them in domestic and franchise cricket and tries to absorb as much as possible from their experience.“A lot of the seniors in our team are legends in a way so I try to learn from them when I bat or bowl. I feel that it enhances my game and I just try to learn as much as I can. There are a lot of players with whom I have fun and have a good time. I’ve known Harshit because he plays for Delhi. I’ve a lot of fun with Arshdeep and Shreyas too. It’s a lot of fun to be with them,” Badoni concluded.",Ayush Badoni feels that taking up bowling a couple of years ago proved to be a turning point in his career.

David Lloyd calls Sachin Tendulkar live after Mark Waugh leaves him out of all-time XI - Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/david-lloyd-calls-sachin-tendulkar-live-after-mark-waugh-leaves-him-out-of-all-time-xi-watch/articleshow/126640953.cms,"Sachin Tendulkar (Photo by Mark Dadswell/Getty Images)

We do not often see Sachin Tendulkar on the receiving end of selection debates, but a recent podcast moment turned that idea on its head and delivered a genuinely funny twist.During an episode of Stick to Cricket, a discussion around an all-time XI took an unexpected turn when former Australia batter Mark Waugh left Tendulkar out of his side. For a name that almost selects itself in any all-time list, the omission raised eyebrows instantly.Across Tests and ODIs, Tendulkar remains the gold standard. He is international cricket’s leading run-scorer, the most capped player the game has seen, and still the only batter to reach 100 international centuries. Even more than a decade after retirement, he is usually one of the first names written down.That is why the moment felt surreal.As the panel reacted, former England captain Michael Vaughan nudged David Lloyd into action. The suggestion was simple. Call Tendulkar live on the show and see how he responds. Lloyd did not hesitate.He dialled the Indian legend on air and repeatedly introduced himself as “Bumble”. Before the conversation could even settle, the call abruptly cut off. Lloyd broke the silence with perfect timing, saying, “He’s gone,” setting off laughter across the studio.The comedy landed because the numbers never lie.We all know Tendulkar signed off with 34,357 international runs from 664 matches across formats, retiring in 2013 after an emotional home Test against the West Indies at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.Among active players, Virat Kohli is the closest challenger. He currently sits second on the all-time run list with 28,091 international runs, still over 6,000 behind. With the 2027 World Cup widely tipped as his international swansong, the clock is ticking.In a recent ODI against New Zealand in Vadodara, Kohli moved past Kumar Sangakkara’s tally of 28,016 runs to claim second place outright. He had already surpassed Tendulkar’s ODI centuries record during the 2023 World Cup, taking his tally to 53 hundreds.In Tests, England’s Joe Root is also closing in. He is fewer than 2,000 runs behind Tendulkar but still trails by 11 centuries, underlining the scale of the challenge.","Sachin Tendulkar was left out of Mark Waugh's all-time XI on Stick to Cricket.

India captain Shubman Gill did not shy away from the shortcomings after his side lost the decisive third ODI against New Zealand by 41 runs at the Holkar Cricket Stadium on Sunday, handing the visitors a historic series win.With the series locked at 1-1 heading into the do-or-die clash, Gill admitted the performance fell well short of expectations. “After the first game, coming here 1-1, the way we played was disappointing. A lot of areas need improvement,” Gill said during the post-match presentation. He, however, pointed out a few positives, adding, “Virat bhai's batting and Harshit's batting have been pluses. Fast bowlers have done well. Keeping World Cup 2027 in mind and where it will be, we want to give Nitish Kumar opportunities.”New Zealand’s victory marked their first ODI bilateral series win in India since 1988, achieved on their eighth attempt.Asked to bat first, New Zealand piled up an imposing 337 for eight. Daryl Mitchell continued his golden run in the series with a second successive hundred, blasting 137 off 131 balls with 15 fours and a six. Glenn Phillips provided further momentum with a commanding 106 from 88 deliveries, striking nine fours and three sixes.Captain Michael Bracewell added late impetus with an unbeaten 28 off 18 balls, featuring four boundaries.India’s bowlers found some success despite the onslaught, with Arshdeep Singh returning figures of 3 for 63 and Harshit Rana picking up 3 for 84.In reply, India’s chase revolved around Virat Kohli , who stood firm while wickets fell around him. Kohli struck a resolute 124 off 108 balls, hitting 10 fours and three sixes. He found valuable support from Harshit Rana, whose maiden ODI fifty came in the form of a brisk 52 off 43 balls, as the pair stitched together a 99-run stand that briefly kept India in the hunt.Nitish Kumar Reddy also chipped in with a composed 53 off 57 balls, including two fours and two sixes, but the target proved too steep. India were bowled out for 296 in 46 overs.For New Zealand, Kristian Clarke led the bowling effort with figures of 3 for 54, while Zakary Foulkes claimed 3 for 77. Jayden Lennox impressed with a tidy spell of 2 for 42, sealing a landmark night for the visitors in Indore.","New Zealand beat India by 41 runs in the third ODI in Indore.

Priyank Panchal post

Former Indian domestic cricketer Priyank Panchal came out strongly against assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate, calling out his comments on Rohit Sharma and Nitish Kumar Reddy and questioning whether foreign coaches truly understand how to handle relationships within Indian cricket.After the defeat to New Zealand, Ten Doeschate spoke about Rohit’s form, pointing out that the India captain “had not been as fluent as he has been” on what he described as a tough wicket. The comment came despite Rohit scoring 26 and 24 in the two ODIs so far, following a Vijay Hazare Trophy outing for Mumbai in December where the returns were 155* and 0.The assistant coach also took aim at Nitish Kumar Reddy, who had scored 20 runs and bowled two overs for 13 in the Rajkot game. The assessment was blunt. Nitish, according to Ten Doeschate, gets opportunities but “often ended up not doing a heck of a lot”.Those words triggered backlash online, with fans calling the remarks disrespectful towards Rohit, a senior figure who had already piled up five fifty-plus scores between the Australia tour in October-November and the Vijay Hazare Trophy, including two centuries. There was similar anger over the criticism of Nitish, a 22-year-old still finding his feet at international level, having played only three ODIs at the time, scoring 47 runs across three innings and going wicketless.Panchal did not hold back. Taking to X, he wrote: “Terrible comments by Ten Doeschate on Rohit and Nitish. There’s a reason foreign coaches don’t succeed in India. The dexterity you require to navigate through relationships here is lacking in them. Especially if they do not have anything notable to show in their CV. #INDvNZ.”The message struck a chord because it went beyond one post-match comment. It tapped into a familiar debate about communication, cultural understanding, and how criticism is delivered within the Indian dressing room.For Panchal, the issue was not analysis alone, but tone, timing and respect. And once those lines are crossed, the fallout is never limited to just one press interaction.",Priyank Panchal hits out at Ryan ten Doeschate's comments on Rohit Sharma and Nitish Kumar Reddy.

KOCHI: Manisha Kalyan’s journey has never followed the well-trodden path. Her move from India to Peru is another sharp turn taken with purpose. From Gokulam Kerala’s relentless pressing game to the demanding rhythms of South American football , the left winger has stepped into what she calls the “next level” of learning.Peru’s Alianza Lima Femenino signed Manisha from Greek club PAOK FC, the South American club announced on Friday.Alianza Lima Femenino will be the third overseas club in Manisha’s career. After playing for Sethu FC and Gokulam Kerala at home, the 24-year-old joined Cyprian club Apollon Ladies FC in 2022. She became the first Indian footballer to compete in the UEFA Women’s Champions League. She scored 14 goals in 36 matches for Apollon Ladies.In 2024, Manisha joined Greek club PAOK FC.Manisha, however, gained in prominence at home, when she featured for Gokulam Kerala FC from 2018 to 2022, a club in which she notched up 21 goals in 24 appearances.Now, having already tested herself in Greece, Manisha is clear about her progression. The level in Europe, she admits, was good.""Peru, though, feels different...it's more professional, more exacting, and far less forgiving.Training sessions are longer, sharper, and layered with detail. Fitness is non-negotiable. Technique is constantly refined. Tactical drills, focus on ball positioning, timing and awareness being in the right place at the right time,"" she tells TOI.For Manisha, this is not a leap of faith so much as the next step in a carefully built learning process. She speaks like a player still in her apprenticeship, not someone content with milestones already reached.The move, on a one-year contract, is about absorbing football education in its most purest form. ""There is still a lot to learn and improve and there's no better place to do that than here in Peru. In terms of technique and fitness, I think this is where I want to be at this stage of my career,"" she explains.""How to read space, how to stretch a back line from the left wing, and how to make decisions under pressure are things I'm looking to learn,"" she adds.There is quiet pride, too, in how far she has come. From Hoshiarpur in Punjab to Greece and now Peru, Manisha carries the imprint of Indian footballers who are hungry to improve. Gokulam Kerala shaped her edge and ambition. In Peru, in a more demanding environment, she believes she has found the classroom she was looking for.","Peru's Alianza Lima Femenino sign Manisha Kalyan from Greek club PAOK FC.

- A step forward -

MADRID: Angry Real Madrid fans jeered their own team before they went on to beat Levante 2-0 in La Liga on Saturday to record new coach Alvaro Arbeloa's first win at the helm. Villarreal, third, stumbled to a 2-0 defeat at Real Betis, hampering their attempts at mounting a title challenge.Arbeloa's debut after replacing Xabi Alonso ended in a humiliating Copa del Rey defeat in midweek at second-tier Albacete, but second-half goals from Kylian Mbappe and Raul Asencio secured Madrid three vital points at a moody Santiago Bernabeu.Second-place Madrid cut the gap on leaders Barcelona to one point before the in-form Spanish champions visit Real Sociedad on Sunday.Star players Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham came in for ire from the home fans after a disastrous week. Mbappe also started but was spared the jeers.The French forward had been expected to return for the Champions League game against Monaco next week as he manages his recovery from a knee sprain.""I've always respected the Bernabeu (crowd), they whistled me a lot too (as a player), and it's one of the aspects that make this club so great, how demanding the fans are,"" said Arbeloa, defending the right of the fans to express themselves.It was Arbeloa's 43rd birthday and he was eventually able to celebrate with a victory, although his team lacked energy and spark in the first half.That was not the case in the stands as a significant part of the crowd harangued their own team, in response to a wild week at the club.Los Blancos lost the Spanish Super Cup final to rivals Barcelona in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, parted ways with Alonso on Monday and then crashed out of the cup on Wednesday.Some fans also chanted for president Florentino Perez to resign in a sour atmosphere in the Spanish capital.Mbappe had the best chance of a flat first half against the team in 19th in La Liga. Reaching a long ball the French superstar met it with a volley that flew wide of the post.Home fans jeered their side in at the break and Madrid emerged for the second half with more impetus, with Arbeloa bringing on Franco Mastantuono and Arda Guler.Mbappe drew a foul in the area from Adrian de la Fuente to earn a penalty, which he dispatched for his 19th league goal of the campaign.Mbappe has scored 50 goals in 53 La Liga games, taking only a little longer than Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer Cristiano Ronaldo to reach the milestone.The Portuguese managed it in 51 appearances.Asencio doubled Madrid's advantage with a header into the top corner from Guler's corner as the hosts took control.Bellingham came close to adding a third but Mathew Ryan parried his header and then saved Vinicius's effort after a darting run from the Brazilian.Ryan thwarted Bellingham again as tensions calmed by the end, with the crowd temporarily sated by the victory. Unless Madrid can build on it, the jeers and whistles will return.""Today was a very important day, playing in front of our fans, we wanted to turn around the situation,"" Asencio told Real Madrid TV.""What happened at Albacete should not have happened, we felt guilty and we wanted to make things better.""Elsewhere, Vedat Muriqi scored a hat-trick for Mallorca in a 3-2 win over Athletic Bilbao, before Villarreal fell to defeat at La Cartuja.Aitor Ruibal and Pablo Fornals's second-half goals helped Betis earn an impressive victory over Marcelino Garcia Toral's visitors.The loss leaves Villarreal eight points behind leaders Barcelona and damaged their chances of competing for a first-ever La Liga title.Betis had more of the ball in an otherwise even first half before Ruibal volleyed them ahead after 57 minutes.Santi Comesana's red card for a rash challenge on Giovani Lo Celso made Villarreal's job harder and Fornals killed the game by drilling home with precision from outside the area with seven minutes remaining.""It was a hard-fought game, the details led to Betis winning, I think a draw would have been fairest,"" Villarreal midfielder Dani Parejo told Movistar.""We lacked the finishing touch but had some clear chances... I think the team showed up well, but in both boxes we weren't quite good enough.""","Real Madrid beat Levante 2-0 in La Liga on Saturday to record new coach Alvaro Arbeloa's first win at the helm.

'India's dream of FIFA World Cup is still alive': Veteran footballer Ashalata Devi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/indias-dream-of-fifa-world-cup-is-still-alive-veteran-footballer-ashalata-devi/articleshow/126613772.cms,"Ashalata Devi (PTI Photo)

Indian women’s football stalwart Ashalata Devi says the dream of seeing the country play at the FIFA Women’s World Cup remains alive, but stressed that sustained progress at the grassroots level is crucial to bridge the gap with the world’s elite.“Our dream of the World Cup is still alive. We still have to work even harder at this time,” Ashalata told PTI.The veteran defender pointed out that all three national teams -- Under-17, Under-19 and the senior side -- have qualified for their respective AFC Asian Championships, making 2026 a potentially defining year for the women’s game in India.“Under-17, Under-19 and the senior team have already qualified for AFC (competitions). If we do well there, obviously our dream of the World Cup is still alive,” she said.One of the most capped players in Indian women’s football history, Ashalata -- who has earned over 100 international caps and captained the national side on multiple occasions -- said the (senior) team has made steady progress but is still short of world-class standards.“We have been doing better for a long time, but still according to world-class levels, we are not there yet.Still, we are trying a lot,” she said.“I have so much faith in the players. Their passion, hard work and dedication — they have been working for so many years. I really hope this time we qualify for the World Cup and do better for Indian women’s football.”Having spent more than a decade anchoring India’s defence, Ashalata identified grassroots development as the biggest area needing immediate attention.“The problem is that we skip the basics and go straight to the technical aspects,” she said.“In my time, I started playing football at the age of 13. Now many players start at 10 or 11. But if we start at five or six years, learning becomes much better.”She emphasised that skill acquisition becomes increasingly difficult with age.“After 17 or 18 years, teaching skills like ball control becomes very difficult. By then, players play more by expression than learning. That’s why grassroots football is very important,” she added.While acknowledging the role of the All India Football Federation (AIFF), the senior pro said responsibility must also lie with state associations.“AIFF has a big role, but every state has its own association. They must show interest and take initiative. Everything cannot be done only at the top level,” Ashalata said, adding that consistency at the state level is essential to create a sustainable pipeline of talent.Off the field, Ashalata has already begun planning her contribution to the game beyond her playing career through the Ashalata Devi Football Festival (ADFF), which she started along with fellow India international Aditi Chauhan in Imphal.“I never knew what I would do after retirement other than football. I still feel connected to football and I wanted to do something for it,” she said.Drawing from her own experiences, Ashalata said the Festival aims to ensure young players do not have to choose between football and education.“When I was young, I couldn’t manage football and school together because there was no academy near my house. I don’t want the next generation to face what I struggled with,” she said.The initiative, which focuses on combining football training with education, has already exceeded expectations.“I planned for around 50 players, but almost 47–48 kids came. I never expected such a response, and I’m really happy,” Ashalata signed off.","Ashalata Devi is one of the most capped players in Indian women’s football history. The veteran defender has earned over 100 international caps and captained the national side on multiple occasions. All three national teams -- Under-17, Under-19 and the senior side -- have qualified for their respective AFC Asian Championships.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126614242,imgsize-24626,width-400,resizemode-4/ashalata-devi-pti-photo.jpg"

Everything is way faster; you must be perfect every second, no time to think twice. Plus, everyone is very physical.""“The transition is big, so body and mind need time to adapt to the speed.It takes a couple of weeks or months.""“The work I've put in, plus teammates now understand my movements and effort on chances. Hard work always pays off—this shows in my last two games with 2-3 goals.""“It's true—scoring sparks confidence instantly. For me, the key is helping the team now; team success is everything. I want us to win together, contributing goals to secure victories.""“That moment was crucial—I positioned to score. Video shows it looked pre-planned, but it flowed naturally. Hard work off the pitch on positioning pays off in those key moments.""""He's a legend here who knows the club inside out. I like him as a person and coach—this week's training has been excellent, leaving us well-prepared. Everyone's enjoying it and looking forward.""""I sense his energy and the knowledge he instils in us—he's highly detailed, which I love. We'll get along great as a team. Looking forward to working with him.""""I'm really looking forward to it—this derby means so much to fans and is special by name alone. We're prepared, believe we can play well, stay organised, and give our best.""""It'd be massive to beat them—they've dominated for a decade, but it won't be easy. We must stay focused and detail-oriented; one lapse means conceding. Everyone needs to be 100 percent.""","Benjamin Sesko speaks exclusively to JioHotstar ahead of Manchester derby.

AIFF to control both ISL, I-League



AIFF retains control in ISL functioning



I-League clubs have more say



ISL clubs not fully behind proposed structure



Poll Do you think AIFF should have more control over the Indian Super League (ISL)? Yes, more control is necessary No, clubs should have more say

I-League proposed to begin on February 19



The All India Football Federation (AIFF) proposed a participation framework structure for both the top-tier Indian Super League (ISL) and the second-division I-League over the past couple of days. While these are still proposals and have not yet been approved by the clubs concerned, they differ in how much control the AIFF wants to exercise over the two tiers of Indian football.In both proposed frameworks, clubs and commercial partners have representation. However, the stark difference lies in the level of control afforded.In the proposed ISL framework, the AIFF has retained final authority and veto power on key decisions, which is not the case in the I-League proposal.The AIFF has proposed two bodies for the ISL, one Governing Council and another to run day-to-day operations.The Governing Council will comprise the AIFF President or Secretary General, AIFF Vice President, AIFF Treasurer, one representative from each club, three representatives from the rights partner or broadcaster, for which a request for proposal is yet to be floated, and two independent members.The Management Committee will be responsible for the league’s day-to-day operations.It will include the AIFF Secretary General, the AIFF Head of Competitions, the AIFF Head of Strategy, five club representatives and three rights partner representatives.While the ISL Governing Council is expected to convene infrequently, the AIFF has effectively retained control. All decisions require a simple majority, but at least two affirmative votes must come from AIFF representatives. As a result, AIFF officials will largely determine outcomes.Revenue sharing, prize money allocation, significant budget alterations, broadcast or commercial rights matters, long-term agreements and contracts above Rs 1 crore will all require the AIFF’s affirmative vote.Even though the AIFF will fully own and operate the I-League, the clubs will collectively be responsible for commercial and operational decisions.As with the ISL structure, the AIFF will have a say in matters pertaining to sporting integrity, regulatory compliance and disciplinary jurisdiction. However, the AIFF has chosen not to exercise veto powers in matters relating to broadcast rights, digital or media rights, sponsorships, marketing, branding or commercial exploitation.Not all ISL clubs are satisfied with the current proposal shared by the AIFF. One official, who chose to remain anonymous, noted that the structure is not new and had previously been discussed under Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL). The official added that the limited influence afforded to the commercial partner could once again prove to be a hurdle when the AIFF invites bidders.Another ISL club official offered a different perspective, comparing the current proposal to the FSDL era, when clubs had little say in most governance matters.On Friday, the AIFF also informed I-League clubs about the proposed schedule for the second division of Indian football. The 11-team league is expected to begin on February 19 and run for 80 days.The I-League will be played in a home-and-away format, with five home and five away matches for all teams. In a reminder of the COVID-affected 2020-21 season, the top six teams will progress to the playoffs, while the bottom five will fight to avoid relegation.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) proposed a participation framework structure for both the top-tier Indian Super League (ISL) and the second- division I-League over the past couple of days.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

NEW DELHI: All the players of FC Goa , including India's national team captain Sandesh Jhingan, along with all the support staff, have accepted a cut in their salaries for the short ISL season of 2025-26, which commences from February 14. A statement made by the club said that it was indeed an act of selflessness in which Indian football is going through so many fluctuations.Posting on X late Thursday, FC Goa said it had held “honest and difficult conversations” with its players as well as staff about some of the challenges presently being faced by the league, as well as itself. It added that the first-team players and technical staff voluntarily agreed to reduce their remuneration, underlining the unity within the squad during a difficult period.“In a moment of real uncertainty for Indian football, our club had honest and difficult conversations about the challenges we are facing. What followed was something that made us incredibly proud,” the club wrote.The club expressed that they were very grateful for this gesture and that this decision had been anything but easy. FC Goa also expressed that this gesture embodied the character and collective spirit that the group has, as the club is more than what transpires on the pitch.It is more than mere performances and achievements. Apart from Jhingan, the squad also consists of India internationals such as Udanta Singh and Boris Singh.This comes against the backdrop of ISL clubs still struggling financially due to the impact of the termination of the Master Rights Agreement (MRA) between the All India Football Federation (AIFF) and its former commercial partner Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) in the month of December. This led to the league being subjected to a waiting period of nearly six months.After the intervention of the sports minister, Mansukh Mandaviya , and a series of negotiations with the teams, all 14 ISL clubs are now confirmed to participate in the season with an aggregated 91 matches to be played in the home and away format with each team set to play a total of 13 matches.In the new format, the clubs will together shoulder 60% of the operating expenses of the league, pegged at Rs 25 crore. At the same time, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has waived the mandatory match eligibility criterion to qualify for the AFC Champions League 2, though the ISL league champions no longer qualify automatically for the group stage. Since they won the Super Cup, FC Goa will qualify for the AFC Champions League 2.",All the players of FC Goa have accepted a cut in their salaries for the short ISL season of 2025-26.

Carrick meets challenge 'head on'

Jobs on the line

Can Arsenal fell Forest?

MANCHESTER: Michael Carrick has the chance to make a fine first impression to his short-term stint as Manchester United manager by derailing local rivals Manchester City's Premier League title challenge on Saturday.City, meanwhile, have the chance to cut the gap on leaders Arsenal to three points at Old Trafford, while United need the points to boost their chances of Champions League football next season.At the other end of the table, Tottenham's Thomas Frank and West Ham boss Nuno Espirito Santo are fighting to save their jobs as the sides clash in a London derby.AFP Sport looks at three talking points ahead of the weekend action:Carrick faces a baptism of fire with the Premier League's top two the opponents for his first two matches in charge of United.""It's what we live for (big games) - some are more challenging than others but it's why we are here. So we'll go for it head on,"" said Carrick.Before a daunting trip to Arsenal next weekend, the former United and England midfielder has the chance to galvanise a season at risk of coming completely off the rails.An FA Cup exit to Brighton last weekend followed a run of just one win in six league games for United either side of Ruben Amorim's dismissal.The Red Devils, however, remain well in contention for a place in next season's Champions League, just three points adrift of fourth-placed Liverpool.Carrick was unbeaten in a previous three-game interim spell at United after the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2021.Since then he gained far more managerial experience at second-tier Middlesbrough, but was sacked in June for failing to achieve promotion to the Premier League.""I understand the job, what it entails and the responsibility of it,"" added Carrick. ""Now I feel in a strong place to move forward and, hopefully, be successful here.""Both Frank and Nuno have defied speculation over their futures to remain in charge for Saturday's clash at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.Spurs have won just four of their last 17 games in all competitions to slip to 14th in the Premier League and bow out of both domestic cups.Frank is on the brink of joining a long list of managers who have failed to make the grade in north London, including Nuno, who lasted just 17 games as Tottenham boss in 2021.The Portuguese coach, already sacked once this season by Nottingham Forest, has managed just two wins in 16 Premier League games since joining the Hammers in September.West Ham desperately need a quick upturn in results as they sit seven points adrift of safety in 18th place,Top of both the Premier League and Champions League, the Gunners are on course for an unprecedented quadruple after FA and League Cup victories this week.But Mikel Arteta's men must overcome a poor record at the City Ground against a Forest side keen to make amends to their furious manager.Arsenal have won in just one of their last five visits to Nottingham.Forest were dumped out of the FA Cup by second-tier Wrexham on penalties last weekend, sparking an outburst from Sean Dyche.""It's unacceptable to me, but it's unacceptable to the badge as well,"" he said of his side's first-half performance left them battling back from 2-0 down before drawing 3-3.Fixtures (all times GMT)SaturdayManchester United v Manchester City (1230), Sunderland v Crystal Palace, Tottenham v West Ham, Liverpool v Burnley, Leeds v Fulham, Chelsea v Brentford (all 1500), Nottingham Forest v Arsenal (1730)SundayWolves v Newcastle (1400), Aston Villa v Everton (1630)MondayBrighton v Bournemouth (2000)",Michael Carrick takes charge of Manchester United for the first time on Saturday.

BARCELONA: Ferran Torres and Lamine Yamal fired Barcelona to a 2-0 win over Racing Santander and into the Copa del Rey quarter-finals on Thursday.The Spanish internationals' strikes helped holders Barca defeat second division leaders Racing to progress from a surprisingly tight last 16 clash and record an 11th consecutive victory across all competitions.The hosts had two goals disallowed for offside and record 32-time winners Barca did just enough to claim victory.""We didn't think they would be so hard to break down,"" admitted Torres to Movistar.""We knew that we had to stretch the game, be calm and in the end it went well.""Having seen Real Madrid eliminated at second-tier Albacete on Wednesday Barca coach Hansi Flick named a fairly strong side, including teenage star Yamal.After a 15 minute delay with some fans stuck outside, the match kicked off at Racing's Sardinero stadium, and Barca quickly took control of the ball.The Catalans struggled to turn possession into a meaningful opening though, and when they finally did Dani Olmo missed his kick from Marcus Rashford's dangerous cross.Racing looked to breach Barcelona's high defensive line but when they did get in behind the visitors managed to mop up well.Giorgi Guliashvili's low effort from range was fielded comfortably by Joan Garcia, and that was as close as the hosts came.Barcelona continued to push forward in the second half and Rashford had a shot tipped away and also drilled narrowly wide.Eventually the Spanish champions took the lead through Torres, after Fermin Lopez sent him through on goal. The Spain international rounded Racing goalkeeper Jokin Ezkieta and rolled home.The hosts were forced on the offensive and twice had the ball in Barcelona's net, but both of Manex Lozano's goals were ruled out for offside.Barca goalkeeper Garcia made a superb save to thwart Lozano one-on-one deep in stoppage time and avoid the game going to extra-time.Barca wrapped up their win with the last kick of the match, Yamal tapping in Raphinha's cross at the back post.""We played the game we had to play, we played a 10 out of 10 match, (with) two offside goals and the chance at the end... it's okay, it's football,"" said Racing defender Alvaro Mantilla.Elsewhere Valencia won 2-0 at Burgos to reach the last eight.",Barcelona beat Racing Santander 2-0 in Copa del Rey last 16.

Tom Brady's Rolex moment dominated the spotlight



Tom Brady watch collection reflects his next chapter

Tom Brady learned early that time can disappear in a single play. On Sept. 7, 2008, he tore his ACL and MCL in his left knee against the Kansas City Chiefs. The injury ended his season after just one drive. From that point forward, Brady treated every comeback, every year, as borrowed time.Still, he returned in 2009 and never slowed down. He played through broken fingers, sore shoulders, and constant wear and tear. Over the next 14 seasons, he rebuilt his career and extended it far beyond expectations. As a result, time became more than a concept for Brady. It became personal.That idea surfaced again on January 18, 2026. During FOX’s NFC Divisional Playoff broadcast between the Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers, Brady drew attention before he even spoke.Before entering the broadcast booth, TB-12 shared a close-up photo on his Instagram Story. The image showed a Rolex Daytona with a rainbow-diamond bezel and a gem-set bracelet. Watch experts later valued the piece at about $480,000. GOAT captioned the post, “Okkkkkkk,” which he shared on Jan 18, 2026, hours before kickoff.Soon after, viewers noticed the watch on-air. As the game unfolded, social media buzzed. The Rolex did not distract from the broadcast.Instead, it added to Brady’s growing image as a style figure in his post-playing career.This was not a one-off moment. In fact, Brady has turned luxury watches into a weekly tradition. Earlier this month, during FOX’s Eagles vs. 49ers playoff broadcast, he wore a rose gold Rolex Oyster Perpetual LandDweller worth more than $50,000. Likewise, in February 2025, while calling Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans, Brady sported a custom Jacob & O. Caviar Tourbillon valued at nearly $740,000.Meanwhile, Brady’s collection carries real market value. In December 2024, Sotheby’s New York auctioned 21 watches from his personal collection. The sale generated millions. Most notably, a rare Rolex Paul Newman Daytona John Player Special sold for $1.1 million, according to Sotheby’s records dated December 2024.At the same time, Brady’s career continues to shift. On January 15, 2026, he confirmed during a FOX media call that he will leave the network after the NFC Championship.

Patriots Focused on Denver Despite Nix’s Injury



Drake Maye and the New England Patriots are preparing for a high-stakes clash against the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship, but it won’t be the quarterback showdown fans were hoping for. The Broncos’ rising star Bo Nix suffered a broken ankle during overtime of their divisional win against the Buffalo Bills, ending his season abruptly. Maye described the news as “heartbreaking,” highlighting both the competitive disappointment and personal empathy he feels for Nix.“Obviously, the news is heartbreaking,” Maye said. “For what a player he is, the guy he is. Just praying for Bo. I know he's gonna bounce back. He's a great player in this league and looking forward to matching up with him.” Maye’s reaction underscores his respect for Nix, whom he has known since the 2024 draft when Maye was selected second and Nix went 12th. Their paths have crossed before, most memorably in the 2022 Holiday Bowl, where Nix led Oregon to a last-minute win over Maye’s UNC team.While the AFC Championship still promises intensity, the matchup will now feature Broncos backup Jarrett Stidham under center instead of Nix.Maye isn’t underestimating Denver, aware that playoff losses to backup quarterbacks are not unheard of. “They have a good team and so it should be a tough one next week,” he said. His comments reflect a balanced approach—acknowledging the challenge ahead while showing class toward Nix.Beyond the tactical implications, there’s a human story unfolding. Maye and Nix share mutual respect that goes beyond the field. Maye revealed he got to know Nix and his family ahead of the draft, emphasizing the personal side of sports that often goes unnoticed. “Just look forward to matching up with him,” Maye said. “We had one in college, and he got the best of me. I know he'll bounce back.”For the Patriots, the game in Denver represents one of the most significant moments of Maye’s young career. The AFC Championship is a proving ground, not just for team supremacy but for the personal ambitions of a quarterback eager to carve out his legacy. While fans hoped for a Maye versus Nix showdown, the heart of the story remains-respect, resilience, and the relentless pursuit of victory.","Drake Maye and the New England Patriots are preparing for a high-stakes clash against the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship.

Patriots dominate Texans as Cardi B shines as ultimate fan



Cardi B is talking the talk as the New England Patriots walk the walk. The hip-hop superstar, who recently confirmed her relationship with Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs, didn’t hold back after ESPN analysts predicted the Houston Texans would advance to the AFC Championship. Mina Kimes, Ryan Clark, Hannah Storm, Dan Orlovsky, and Marcus Spears all had Houston as their pick—but the Patriots proved them spectacularly wrong.The victory was far from a fluke. New England capitalized on multiple turnovers, including four interceptions from Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud, while clutch plays from Diggs and Kayshon Boutte turned the game decisively in the Patriots’ favor. When the final whistle blew on a 28-16 win, Cardi B took to X to express her excitement. “THEY DIDN’T BELIEVE IN US !!! I LIKE US!!!!! WE ALL WE GOT!!!!! WE ALL WE NEED !!!!” she wrote, pairing it with a playful video that added, “What are you talking about? Nothing!”Stefon Diggs contributed four catches for 40 yards and a touchdown, while Boutte stole the spotlight with three receptions totaling 75 yards, including a stunning one-handed touchdown grab in the fourth quarter that sealed the game. The Texans’ five turnovers, including a pick-six by Marcus Jones, made the Patriots’ path to victory relatively smooth and emphasized New England’s sharp execution under pressure.For Cardi B, this win was more than a football moment- it was a personal celebration. Since confirming her relationship with Diggs in September, she has been a fixture at Gillette Stadium, cheering alongside other players’ partners and even team owner Robert Kraft.In November, the couple welcomed their first child, and Cardi B hasn’t been shy about showing her unfiltered joy for both Diggs’ performance and the team’s success throughout the season.The Patriots are now just one win away from returning to the Super Bowl, marking their first AFC Championship appearance in the post-Bill Belichick and Tom Brady era.

Drake Maye’s wife Ann Michael blends luxury and loyalty with viral Patriots playoff outfit



Drake Maye has rewritten the New England Patriots’ season with a surge few saw coming, and Sunday’s Divisional Round win felt like the moment it all became real. In front of a frozen Massachusetts crowd, the Patriots brushed aside the Houston Texans 28-16, a scoreline that reflected grit more than glamour. Snow fell, pressure mounted, and yet the second-year quarterback looked calm, measured, and fully in command.The result sent New England to its first AFC Championship game since 2019, a milestone that once felt distant after a four-win rookie year for Maye. Now, at 14-3, the Patriots are not just back in contention. They are leading the conversation. The turnaround has been swift, bold, and driven by a quarterback playing with poise beyond his 23 years. But, it was Maye's wife Ann Michael who still stole the spotlight with her message.While Maye carved up the Texans on the field, the stands and sidelines told their own story. Gillette Stadium has been awash in “I ❤️Drake Maye” shirts all season, a visual symbol of how quickly fans have embraced their new leader. On Sunday, that message carried extra weight.Ann Michael Maye, Drake’s wife, stood out pregame in an “I ❤️Drake Maye” sweatshirt paired with an elite fur coat, proudly showing her support.She has become a familiar presence with her game day looks, often shared on TikTok, but this one struck a chord with fans. It blended style, loyalty, and a sense of shared journey.Houston arrived with the league’s top-ranked defense and fresh confidence from a rare road playoff win. They left with another Divisional Round exit and few answers for Maye’s control of tempo and space. The young passer navigated tight coverage, leaned on smart reads, and punished mistakes without forcing the game. That performance has only strengthened his case as a front-runner for NFL Most Valuable Player.Next week, the challenge grows steeper. New England travels to Denver to face the top-seeded Broncos with a Super Bowl 60 berth on the line, scheduled for Sunday, 8 February. It is unfamiliar ground for a Patriots team that once ruled January football at home. Still, belief travels well when confidence runs this deep.Their story adds a human layer to a season defined by results. Drake and Ann began dating in middle school, stayed together through high school, and attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He proposed in January 2025, shortly after his rookie season, and they married in June. As the Patriots chase another Super Bowl dream, that steady partnership mirrors the calm Maye brings to the huddle, grounded, confident, and ready for the moment.",Drake Maye has rewritten the New England Patriots’ season with a surge few saw coming.

Astrologer predicts 2026 breakups for NFL couples and fans breathe easy for Swift and Kelce

Celebrity relationships inside the NFL rarely stay confined to the sidelines, but this week the conversation took an unusual turn. An astrologer’s predictions about which high-profile football romances may not survive 2026 sent fans searching for signs, symbols, and meaning far beyond box scores. In a culture obsessed with both star power and longevity, the idea that the stars themselves might weigh in proved irresistible.The debate intensified when one relationship was notably left out. As speculation swirled around younger NFL couples, Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift emerged untouched by cosmic concern. For followers of the most watched sports pop culture pairing in America, that silence spoke loudly.Astrologer Richard James, host of StarCast Weekly, told TMZ that not every rising NFL romance is aligned for the long haul. He singled out Justin Herbert and singer Madison Beer, pointing to conflicting emotional drivers.""Two Pisces together can easily lose direction,"" James explained. ""His Mars is in Aries, which makes him impulsive and driven by instinct. Her Mars is in Scorpio, which is more intense and focused on depth and longevity.That can create early chemistry, but it often fades once expectations diverge.""James also expressed doubts about Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart and model Marissa Ayers, suggesting that ambition and communication gaps could strain a relationship still in its early stages.""Confidence is attractive, but someone can fall in love with potential rather than reality,"" James said. ""When one person starts feeling they're giving more than they're getting, things unravel quickly.""Yet Swift and Kelce were never mentioned. The omission calmed fans who track every development of their relationship with near forensic interest. Recent reports suggest the couple is taking a slow, deliberate approach to wedding planning, choosing presence over pressure as Kelce weighs his NFL future and Swift balances a demanding global schedule.Whether astrology predicts fate or simply fuels fascination, the response shows how deeply fans are invested in the personal lives of their sports heroes. For now, the absence of any ominous forecast may be the most reassuring sign of all for Swift and Kelce.","Astrologer predicts 2026 breakups for NFL couples.

The fake photo misled many online before being debunked, highlighting growing concerns over AI manipulation, misinformation, and the impact of viral hoaxes on grieving public figures navigating life in the digital spotlight.

AI kissing photo pulls Erika Kirk into unwanted Tom Brady dating rumours

Four months after the sudden death of Charlie Kirk, his widow Erika Kirk found herself pulled into a controversy she never invited. A viral image, falsely showing her kissing NFL icon Tom Brady, spread rapidly across social media, igniting dating rumours that were entirely fabricated but widely believed.The timing intensified the backlash. Erika is still navigating grief, raising two children, and stepping into a high-profile leadership role as the new CEO of Turning Point USA. Despite her visible focus on work and family, online speculation escalated with shocking speed, exposing how easily AI-driven misinformation can blur reality.The controversy began when an X user posted an AI-generated image appearing to show Erika and Brady kissing. At first glance, the photo looked authentic, prompting some users to assume a secret relationship. Others quickly noticed red flags.“Everyone grieves differently,” one fan sarcastically commented. “AI is getting out of hand,” another wrote. “The books among other things in this picture is a big AI giveaway,” one user pointed out. “They're not wasting time,” another joked. “Why doesn't she have her hands on the back of his cranium like she did with JD Vance?” a commenter added.The rumours escalated when another post claimed, without evidence, that Erika and Brady were dating. The internet responded with edited images and dark humour, including manipulated photos placing Brady beside Charlie Kirk’s grave. Yahoo News later confirmed the rumours were false, but by then, the damage was already done.“So she already moved on? It's been like 5 months only,” one user wrote. “She said that she will be single for the rest of her life. This isn't true,” another claimed. “I guess this is one of the stages of Erika's mourning,” a third added.Erika has not acted publicly, preferring to remain silent rather than make a show of it. The episode brings into the limelight a rising concern. Images of AI are moving at a faster pace than facts, and in the case of mourning figures of public people, it is a personal price to pay. What started as digital editing turned out to be a strong reminder that sorrow will not protect anyone in the viral era.","AI-generated image falsely showing Erika Kirk kissing Tom Brady went viral, sparking dating rumours just months after the death of her husband, Charlie Kirk.

Gisele Bündchen’s cryptic words spark fresh debate about her life after Tom Brady

As the new year opened, Gisele Bündchen shared a message that quickly caught attention for what it said and what it hinted at. Posted quietly on Instagram , the words focused on gratitude, self-trust, and following the heart. For many readers, the timing felt pointed. Reports had already surfaced questioning whether her recent marriage marked a misstep rather than a fresh start.The post landed against a backdrop of constant speculation surrounding Bündchen’s personal life since her split from Tom Brady. While she has stayed largely private, each public move continues to invite scrutiny. This time, a reflective caption fueled debate about whether she was affirming her choices or responding to doubts she chose not to address directly.Bündchen shared family moments and wrote: “As the new year unfolds, my heart is full of gratitude for the moments spent recharging with my family. May this year bring you love, health, peace, and new adventures. May you find the courage to honor your heart’s calling and to know and love yourself more deeply.”She continued: “Wishing you endless blessings and a beautiful journey ahead. Here’s to making 2026 a truly joyful and meaningful year.Sending so much love.”The message followed reports that some relatives questioned her decision to marry Joaquim Valente, the father of her youngest child. According to sources, concerns centered on finances and timing rather than affection. Bündchen is estimated to be worth hundreds of millions, while Valente’s wealth is more modest. A prenup is reportedly in place, though it includes provisions for a financial settlement if the marriage ends.Still, those close to Brady suggest there is no lingering bitterness. “He’s happy in the way that is simple: he’s happy that she is happy,” a source previously said, noting that peace between the former couple benefits their children most.Bündchen has not addressed criticism directly. Instead, her message leaned inward. Less explanation. More intention. Whether reassurance or quiet resolve, her words suggest a woman choosing conviction over noise, and calm over commentary.","Gisele Bündchen shared a reflective Instagram post about following her heart, prompting renewed speculation about her recent marriage to Joaquim Valente.

Houston Rockets injury update on Steven Adams' status



Steven Adams' injury impact on the Rockets' rotation



The Houston Rockets faced an anxious moment late Sunday when veteran center Steven Adams exited their game against the New Orleans Pelicans after a hard fall in the fourth quarter. The incident occurred during a defensive stand. Adams remained on the floor in discomfort. Medical staff rushed in as teammates looked on his status.Adams eventually left the court with assistance and headed straight to the locker room, leaving the Rockets without one of their most reliable physical anchors. Houston secured a 119-109 win, but Adams’ condition and injury update sparks questions among fans of the franchise.The injury occurred when Steven Adams attempted to block a Zion Williamson layup with under ten minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. He landed awkwardly on his left leg and was unable to put weight on it. Adams tried to walk off under his own power but needed help from two staff members to reach the locker room.Before exiting, Adams logged 27 minutes and finished with five points, 10 rebounds, and two assists. He did not return to the game.Afterward, Rockets coach Ime Udoka offered an initial assessment that provided some relief.“Sprained ankle. Lots of swelling already. Nothing broken. Not a high ankle sprain, not sure about everything, as far as time-wise,” Udoka said.Later evaluations clarified that Adams has been diagnosed with a high ankle sprain. The team has yet to announce a firm timetable for his return, though swelling remains a key factor in determining next steps.Adams has played a central role in Houston’s frontcourt success this season, particularly on the glass. He ranks among the league leaders in offensive rebounding, averaging more than four per game, and provides physical screens that open space for Houston’s guards.Adams’ presence alongside Alperen Sengun has allowed the Rockets to control the pace and punish several opponents.As Adams is sidelined, Houston may lean more heavily on Clint Capela to support Sengun, especially considering that the lineups require rim protection and rebounding. Dorian Finney-Smith could also see increased minutes.Through 31 games, Adams has averaged 5.9 points and 8.6 rebounds in limited minutes. As for now, the Rockets will continue monitoring his recovery.",Houston Rockets center Steven Adams suffered a high ankle sprain in Sunday's 119-109 win over the New Orleans Pelicans.

Donovan Mitchell’s Panamanian connection

Donovan Mitchell is redefining the All-Star landscape

The NBA All-Star game is a night where the league showcases some of its finest players who made it to the hardwood through weeks of fan voting. But the new twist in the USA vs. World format is sending shockwaves through the league. Cleveland Cavaliers superstar Donovan Mitchell has shown interest and desire to suit up for Team World at the 2026 NBA All-Star. While most fans associate Mitchell with the stars and stripes of Team USA, Mitchell is looking to honor his deep-rooted Panamanian heritage.With the NBA leaning harder into the international rivalry format, Mitchell’s potential defection isn't just about a jersey, it’s about cultural identity. The four-time All-Star is making it clear that his roots run deeper than his birthplace, and he’s ready to represent it on the global stage.For many casual observers, Mitchell is the quintessential American guard due to his scoring ability and high-level efficiency. However, his connection to his mother’s Panamanian heritage has always been a private point of pride that he’s now ready to bring to the hardwood. The Cavaliers' leading man recently opened up about the lack of recognition regarding his international ties, and he isn't mincing words about where his heart lies for the upcoming festivities.“I do think I should be on the World Team, but I don’t think people look at me as like a Panamanian basketball player. But I do,” Mitchell stated. “I would love to be on the World team if I got a chance. Don't get me wrong, but definitely want to show love to my Panamanian roots and my people in Panama. My grandmother being from Panama, she came over here on a boat, no plan, no money, and two generations later, here we are.”By choosing to align with Team World, Mitchell is aiming to highlight the diversity of the NBA’s talent pool and bring visibility to a region not typically associated with high-level guards. If the league allows the switch, a Team World backcourt featuring Mitchell alongside international titans like Luka Dončić or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander would be a nightmare for Team USA to contain.Mitchell’s request comes at a pivotal time for the league. As the NBA struggles to keep the All-Star game competitive, the USA vs. World format has been the go-to solution to inject some action into the game.

Rosamund Pike and son Atom’s courtside family moment extends the hype for NBA’s global expansion



The Oscar-nominated actress Rosamund Pike has made a rare public appearance with her youngest son, Atom, attending the NBA London game at the O2 Arena on January 18. The outing placed Pike among a packed crowd watching the Memphis Grizzlies face the Orlando Magic, a matchup that ended in a 126-109 win for Memphis.Public moments with her children are not quite common for Pike. The mother and son were seated together as the arena filled with celebrities, athletes, and international basketball fans.Rosamund Pike, 46, kept her look understated for the game, wearing an all-black outfit paired with a long jacket and dark sunglasses. Atom, 11, embraced the occasion in a blue and white bomber jacket as he followed the action from close range. The pair watched as the Grizzlies controlled the game, with the O2 hosting its latest chapter in the NBA’s expanding presence in the UK.Pike shares Atom and his older brother, Solo, with longtime partner Robie Uniacke. While she typically shields her sons from public view, she has spoken in the past about how motherhood influenced her approach to work and creativity. In a 2014 interview with Glamour, she said, “You have less time to worry and overanalyze when you're a parent,” adding, “With children, you spend so much time reexperiencing the world as a child experiences it, and that has a nourishing effect on your imagination.In my job, imagination is key.”Pike has occasionally shared small insights into life with her two boys. During a 2018 appearance on Live with Kelly and Ryan, she described their dynamic with humor. “The good news is they are a team,” she said, before adding, “The bad news is they're quite a naughty team.”Pike has previously revealed that she and Solo learned Mandarin together, and in October 2024, Solo won the Chinese Bridge Chinese Proficiency Competition in the primary school category, earning recognition as a “Future Star of Chinese.”The NBA London game offered a relaxed setting for Pike and Atom to enjoy time together while surrounded by a global sports audience. As the league continues to return to the UK, the night extends the hype for the NBA’s global expansion.","Rosamund Pike made a rare public appearance with her youngest son, Atom.

Flagg’s historic rookie campaign on pause

Copper Flagg's road to recovery and Roty race

The Dallas Mavericks’ season just hit a major speed bump. After spending the first half of the season proving he was more than just a pre-draft hype train, rookie phenom Cooper Flagg has been sidelined with a left ankle sprain. The injury occurred during a January 14 showdown against the Denver Nuggets when Flagg rolled the ankle while defending Peyton Watson in the first half. While he briefly attempted a gutsy return before halftime, Mavs training staff made the cautious, and likely smart, call to shut him down. Now, Dallas fans are left holding their breath as the Rookie of the Year frontrunner watches from the bench.Before the injury, Flagg wasn't just playing well for a rookie, he was playing like an All-NBA lock. The 19-year-old Duke product currently leads the Mavericks in scoring, averaging a staggering 18.8 points per game, a drop after missing two consecutive games. He hasn't just been a bucket-getter, Flagg is the only rookie in the league ranking in the top three across all five major statistical categories: points, rebounds (6.3), assists (4.2), steals (1.3), and blocks (0.8).His impact was most apparent just two nights before the injury, when he torched Brooklyn Nets for 27 points, 5 rebounds, 5 assists and 3 steals with 10 shots from the field despite tweaking that same ankle.Flaggs prowess on both ends of the floor has turned the Mavericks into must-watch television, and without him, they lose their primary defensive anchor and their most versatile offensive weapon. His absence from the bench leaves a massive void in a rotation that is already missing their veteran star Anthony Davis.The big question now: how long will the Flagg be sidelined? As of today, January 19, Flagg is considered a game-time decision for tonight’s matchup against the New York Knicks at MSG. While he has already missed two consecutive games, his status has been upgraded from doubtful to questionable, is a clear sign that the swelling is down and that the 2025 #1 pick is itching to get back on the hardwood.The Mavericks’ front office is walking a tightrope. They desperately need Flagg’s production to keep pace in a crowded Western Conference, but they can’t afford to risk the long-term health of the new face of the franchise. With fellow rookie Kon Knueppel currently neck-and-neck with him in the scoring race, every missed game matters for the award season. But for Dallas, the focus remains simple: get Cooper back at 100% so he can continue his march toward greatness.",Dallas Mavericks rookie phenom Cooper Flagg has been sidelined with a left ankle sprain.

Milwaukee Bucks vs Atlanta Hawks Players driving each side

How the game may play out

Theplay theon January 19, 2026, in a game shaped by injuries on both sides. It is an Eastern Conference matchup where rotations matter more than name value, and where execution is likely to decide the result.Both teams are still trying to find consistency. Atlanta comes in short-handed and trying to stop a slide. Milwaukee has been uneven for weeks but enters with a healthier roster. On a day when many games lean into ceremony, this one comes down to basic things: who defends better, who rebounds, and who takes care of the ball late.Atlanta Hawks’ frontcourt has taken multiple hits. N’Faly Dante remains out after an ACL tear. Zaccharie Risacher will not play due to a left knee bone contusion. Kristaps Porzingis is also out, dealing with left Achilles tendinitis and now missing his fifth straight game. His absence removes rim protection and spacing that Atlanta has struggled to replace.Dyson Daniels is listed as questionable with a right ankle sprain. If he sits, Atlanta may be forced into smaller lineups, which affects both defense and rebounding.His status is one of the biggest unknowns going into tip-off.Milwaukee Bucks do not carry the same level of injury concern into this game. The Bucks are 17-24 and still searching for rhythm, but their rotation is more stable. That matters against an Atlanta team already adjusting on the fly.Recent wins over Denver and Dallas showed that Milwaukee can compete when its defense holds. Those performances also highlighted the issue that has followed the team all season: when defensive focus drops, games slip away quickly.Atlanta Hawks continue to rely on Jalen Johnson, who is averaging 21.4 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 8.0 assists. Onyeka Okongwu has been steady inside with 16.2 points and 8.1 rebounds. If Daniels plays, his ability to generate steals could disrupt Milwaukee’s ball movement.For Milwaukee Bucks, Kevin Porter Jr. leads the offense with 17.7 points and 7.8 assists per game. Ryan Rollins has taken on a larger role, averaging 14.5 points and 5.2 assists, while also spacing the floor with 2.2 made threes per game.Atlanta scores more overall but also gives up more points. Milwaukee’s edge comes from depth and availability. If the Bucks stay disciplined defensively, they are positioned to pull away late.The expectation is a close game that opens up in the final minutes. Milwaukee has the clearer path to a 118-112 win, though Daniels playing would narrow that margin quickly.","Atlanta Hawks’ frontcourt has taken multiple hits.

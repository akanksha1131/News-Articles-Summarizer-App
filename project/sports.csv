Shubman Gill on missed chances, fielding lapses & World Cup preparation after ODI series loss

INDORE: Blaming head coach Gautam Gambhir for India’s series loss to New Zealand would be lazy analysis. Of course, as head coach he is responsible for team tactics and selections, but India made too many errors to go unpunished. Batters failed to convert starts, fielders dropped sitters, allowed rival batters to turn ones into twos and missed direct hits. The list is long.Unfortunately for Gambhir, it is the Black Caps again who seem to be haunting him. In 2024, New Zealand whitewashed India 3–0 for their maiden Test series win in India. On both occasions, their team was vastly inexperienced and India were overwhelming favourites.The latest reversal could add to the scrutiny on Gambhir ahead of the T20 World Cup at home next month. His position as India’s head coach in Tests is already under the scanner after the team was whipped 2–0 by South Africa in the two-Test series in Nov–Dec last year, marking the team’s first Test series win in India in 25 years. That defeat made Gambhir the first India head coach to preside over two whitewashes in home Test series.India were also vanquished 3-1 in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in the 2024–25 season. The only bright spot in Gambhir’s coaching record has been the 2–2 draw in the fiveTest series in England under new captain Shubman Gill last summer.The ODI record on his CV looks better with the ICC Champions Trophy triumph. But the truth is that India have lost three bilateral ODI series in his 19-month tenure. In July 2024, India lost a series in Sri Lanka (2–1) for the first time in 28 years. While they beat South Africa 2–1 at home, they lost a bilateral series in Australia by the same margin.His T20I statistics as a coach, however, are brilliant, and it is this format that he will be banking on as India look to defend their title.Last week, a known Gambhir critic — former India batter and Bengal skipper Manoj Tiwary — accused Gambhir of playing a role in removing Rohit Sharma as ODI captain despite India winning the Champions Trophy. He also hinted that Ajit Agarkar, chairman of the selection committee, may have been swayed into replacing Rohit with Gill.In Gambhir’s defence, though, it can be said that he arrived at a time when several of India’s senior players were on the decline. He has also made some good calls like appointing Suryakumar Yadav as T20I captain instead of the injury-prone Hardik Pandya , backing players like Harshit Rana. Having closely observed Varun Chakravarthy’s spin magic during his stint as mentor of the KKR in the IPL, Gambhir pushed for Varun’s recall, a decision that worked like a charm.The coach’s decision to give more opportunities to Washington Sundar and to persist with KL Rahul as batterkeeper while benching Rishabh Pant in ODIs has also paid dividends.In his playing days, Gambhir was known as a combative and brave lefthander who scored ugly but tough runs. If India win the T20 World Cup, even while playing ugly cricket, Gambhir would not mind one bit.",Gautam Gambhir under scrutiny ahead of T20 World Cup at home next month.

Good luck for your stint with London Spirit. Barring 2022, when Spirit were in the race for qualifying for the play-offs, the team unfortunately has not performed as well as people would like it to. As a coach, how challenging is it to take over a franchise that did not enjoy decent results?

ISPL | Chennai Singhams' Mohammed Nadeem credits management for his success

With your experience of sitting in the auctions and planning and building teams, will that help you when The Hundred goes in for the first-ever auctions this year? Have you got a shopping list ready?

Andy, you were associated for so long with England, and you obviously coached teams at Lord’s. Having had that amount of experience, how did the traditional Middlesex members and crowds warm up to The Hundred?

Do you think eventually a 100-ball event will overtake the popularity of T20, and will other countries embrace the format?

You said you were involved with Trent Rockets, and you had such a large coaching experience in terms of T20 franchises. We saw a lot of innovations come in with both bat and ball because of ODIs and T20Is in the five-year history of The Hundred. As a coach in one of the franchises earlier, do you think any particular innovation came through because of The Hundred?

Do you think we could have Indian talent also come and play in The Hundred one day?

You talked about innovations coming into the game, and you were a terrific Test match batter also. As someone who almost legitimised the reverse sweep by playing it so successfully and efficiently, even in Test match cricket, why did it become such an effective shot even in red-ball cricket?

Out of curiosity, I just wanted to ask you, did you ever get dismissed while playing the reverse sweep?

You coached so many teams and so many players across countries. As a coach, and as a very successful coach, what makes a player coachable?

What are your views on coaching players one-on-one, like we see in tennis? Were you ever approached by players to work with them one-on-one?

If given an offer to coach internationally, or coach India, would you take it up? If you were willing to take up the offer, would you take up the white-ball job or the red-ball job?

You mentioned going back to The Hundred and the format. You mentioned 10 balls, a set of 10 balls bowled. Since you are also in the coaching set-up in the IPL, what are your views on match-ups? We keep hearing a lot about match-ups: left-right, right-left. Do we overplay it sometimes?

Related to match-ups and data: have you used AI for analysis in your coaching, and how do you see the implementation of AI into coaching and data analysis?

Shubman Gill on missed chances, fielding lapses & World Cup preparation after ODI series loss

Poll What do you think is the main reason for India's recent ODI losses? Excessive changes in the lineup Lack of clarity in player roles Inadequate coaching strategies Strong opposition teams

NEW DELHI: Former India batter Ajinkya Rahane has delivered a blunt assessment of what he believes is going wrong in the Indian team under head coach Gautam Gambhir , following the side’s 1-2 ODI series defeat to New Zealand at home. Calling for clarity, security and honest conversations, Rahane said India’s recent struggles in the 50-over format were a result of excessive changes and a lack of defined roles as the team builds towards the 2027 ODI World Cup.India began the three-match series on a positive note with a win in the opener under Shubman Gill , but losses in the next two games handed New Zealand the series. Even Virat Kohli ’s standout performances were not enough to turn the tide.Speaking on Cricbuzz, Rahane did not shy away from highlighting uncomfortable truths. “See, there will be tough questions. India lost five ODIs in the last nine. And that’s the reason: too many changes,” he said. “You are looking at the World Cup, where players actually need that security, that clarity from management. If you are going to play certain players in that format, it’s always about clarity.”Under Gambhir, India have now lost ODI series to Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand, raising concerns about direction and continuity.Rahane stressed that results would improve if the management focused on communication and stability. “So yes, tough questions will be asked, which is very natural,” he added, pointing out how deeply fans are emotionally invested in Indian cricket.Rahane also underlined the weight of expectations in home conditions. “Especially in India, playing against New Zealand, which was probably the New Zealand A or B team, due respect to all the players. But expectations were there that we all thought India would win easily, probably 3-0,” he said, while also praising New Zealand’s execution.Despite the criticism, Rahane believes the scheduling break could work in India’s favour. India do not play another ODI until July 2026, when they tour England, and he feels the gap offers the management time to reset. “They just need to follow the process. Just see which are the players you are going to back,” Rahane said. “You have time. After T20, there’s nothing at all.”Emphasising the need for decisive planning, he concluded, “It’s always about finding your right thing, right players, right combination, and just back them.”",Former India batter Ajinkya Rahane has delivered a blunt assessment of what he believes is going wrong in the Indian team under head coach Gautam Gambhir.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma’s lean run with the bat has sparked debate after another modest outing in the third and deciding ODI against New Zealand in Indore on Sunday.Rohit, who scored just 11 runs off 13 balls, continued a dip in form that has raised questions about his motivation as he enters the final phase of his international career.Having retired from T20Is and Test cricket, Rohit is now active only in ODIs.While he was named Player of the Series during India’s ODI series against Australia last year, he has struggled to replicate that form in recent months.Against South Africa, Rohit managed 146 runs in three matches, but his output dropped sharply against New Zealand, where he scored only 61 runs across the three-game series.Rohit’s failure in the series decider prompted former New Zealand fast bowler Simon Doull to question whether the veteran still has a clear goal driving him.Speaking during commentary on Star Sports Network, Doull said: ""I feel with Rohit, he's always had something to chase, as in a goal in mind, whether it be a T20 World Cup, whether it be a 50-over World Cup. I just wonder, that 27 World Cup in South Africa, is that too far away? Does he have that real hunger? Maybe it's just, I mean, it's different every year, isn't it? Because we're building up. We seem to be building up as national sides, no matter who you are.Each year, you're building up to a different format of an ICC event, aren't you?""The last little while and coming up for the next two weeks, we're building up to a T20 World Cup. So there's very little one-day cricket played in the last four months and in the next three or four months. Next year, I'm guessing, or later this year and going into next year, there'll be an absolute diet of 50-over cricket.""When you're only playing one format, you don't get huge amounts of opportunities. The next time he's in the Indian uniform will be, what, July in the UK? It's a long way away.""While Rohit endured a tough series, Virat Kohli stood out for India, finishing as the top scorer with 240 runs at an average of 80, including a century in the final ODI, though it came in a losing cause.","India captain Rohit Sharma has struggled with the bat in recent months.

Shubman Gill on missed chances, fielding lapses & World Cup preparation after ODI series loss

Following India’s first-ever ODI series defeat to New Zealand at home, former India cricketer Ravichandran Ashwin said the team’s response to the challenge posed by the visitors looked ""a bit flat"" and felt New Zealand had effectively won the series ""5-0"".The series win was a landmark moment for a Michael Bracewell-led New Zealand side that toured India without several regular players. Contributions from Daryl Mitchell, Jayden Lennox, Glenn Phillips and Kristian Clarke helped the visitors recover from a loss in the opening ODI and clinch the series 2-1.In the third and final ODI, New Zealand posted 337/8 after being asked to bat. India were reduced to 71/4 in the chase, but partnerships involving Virat Kohli (124), Nitish Kumar Reddy (53) and Harshit Rana (52) brought the hosts back into the game. New Zealand, however, struck at key moments to secure a 41-run win and seal the series.The result marked New Zealand’s first ODI series win in India. It came a little over a year after New Zealand handed India a 3-0 Test series defeat at home in 2024, India’s first Test series loss on home soil in 12 years.Speaking on his YouTube show ‘Ash ki Baat’, Ashwin said the series could soon fade from memory depending on results in upcoming tournaments.""Everything will be forgotten now. There is the T20 World Cup and the IPL now. So, if the environment is there, things will go accordingly. We all know this. But if the T20 World Cup does not go well and people do not perform in the IPL too, there will be pressure on them. But if everything goes well, this series will be forgotten. In my books, New Zealand won the series 5-0. They won two but threatened to win one more too, so it was actually a sweep,"" Ashwin said.Ashwin added that he was unsure whether the issues stemmed from preparation or readiness, but felt India’s response under pressure was lacking.""I thought if India even plays their B or C teams, they can beat sides. I am a little worried now that this has nothing to do with the team's quality. Looking from the outside, I think the Indian team's response has been a bit flat. That response is not there. Always, when the team has been put under pressure, the Indian team has found ways in the past and has shown that habit. I just felt that the response felt flat, and that was disappointing. I do not think we put them under pressure. We played very soft cricket,"" he concluded.In the final ODI, centuries from Daryl Mitchell (137 not out) and Glenn Phillips (106) took New Zealand to 337/8, despite Harshit Rana and Arshdeep Singh picking up three wickets each. After slipping to 5/2 and then 58/3, Mitchell and Phillips added 219 runs to take control of the innings.India’s chase began poorly, but an 88-run stand between Kohli and Reddy, followed by a 99-run partnership between Kohli and Rana, kept the hosts in contention. Kohli scored 124 off 108 balls, but once he was dismissed, India lost the remaining wickets and were bowled out for 296 in 46 overs, handing New Zealand a 2-1 series win.","Ravichandran Ashwin says India's response to New Zealand challenge looked ""a bit flat"" Former India cricketer feels New Zealand effectively won the series ""5-0"" Daryl Mitchell, Jayden Lennox, Glenn Phillips and Kristian Clarke helped visitors recover from a loss in the opening ODI and clinch the series 2-1.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126702480,imgsize-48930,width-400,resizemode-4/mj-50.jpg"

Matthew Breetzke on tough St George’s wicket, crucial win and playoff push for SEC

How it unfoded



By the late 1990s, West Indies were no longer the dominant force they had been through the 1970s and 1980s. Losses to Australia, both home and away, and a 3-0 Test series defeat in Pakistan had pushed them down to No. 4 in the ICC Test rankings. Even so, they remained a respected side. That is why there was genuine interest when West Indies toured South Africa for the first time in the 1998–99 season, with the two teams appearing evenly matched on paper.What followed turned into one of the most one-sided tours in Test history.Led by Hansie Cronje, South Africa dominated the West Indies in the whole tour. Proteas won the seven-match ODI series 6-1 and completed a clean sweep in the five-Test series, winning 5-0. The margins underlined the gap between the sides. South Africa won the first Test by four wickets, the second by 178 runs, the third by nine wickets, the fourth by 149 runs and the fifth by 351 runs.The final Test, played from January 15 to 18, 1999, produced a moment that remains rare in the game. At the end of the match, adjudicator Dennis Lindsay named the entire South African team as Player of the Match.West Indies captain Brian Lara won the Toss and elected to field against the Proteas.The Lara-led side had already lost the series, having faced defeat in all four previous Tests of the series.West Indies made a good start on day 1 and reduced South Africa to 5-2 and then 123-6. However, South Africa made a strong comeback and ended day 1 at 311/9 thanks to Mark Boucher's 100 and Jacques Kallis's 83. The innings ended early on day two at 313. Lance Klusener, recalled for the injured Terbrugge, added useful runs at the end.West Indies then faced Allan Donald. On a pitch that offered bounce, if not extreme pace, the visitors moved to 102 for 2 after another shaky start, driven by a rapid counter-attack from Lara. He reached fifty from 38 balls, hitting 12 fours, including six off Donald across two overs. His dismissal changed the course of the innings. Donald removed Lara with a short ball, and what followed was a collapse. The last eight wickets fell in 17 overs. Donald finished with his 17th five-wicket haul in Test cricket.West Indies were bowled out for 144, handing South Africa a lead of 169.The comeback for the West Indies from that situation was near impossible, and in their second innings, South African batters made sure that there was no chance for Lara's side.When Courtney Walsh broke down early in South Africa’s second innings, West Indies were left with a young and inexperienced pace attack, which included debutant Reon King, who was still dealing with jet lag. None of the fast bowlers were able to apply pressure. Carl Hooper was the only one who managed to slow the scoring by bowling a defensive line into the rough.Gary Kirsten, coming off a poor run of form, used the opportunity to bat time and scored a hard-earned century. Herschelle Gibbs registered his first fifty of the series, while Hansie Cronje batted with intent. Jonty Rhodes, however, was the most aggressive, taking full advantage of the tiring attack to score a hundred in just 95 balls. It was his first Test century at home and came in emphatic fashion, with his sixth six, all struck off pull shots.Cronje declared South Africa’s innings at 399 for five late on the third day. The decision paid off immediately, as West Indies opener Wallace was caught down the leg side soon after, capping a difficult series for him.On the fourth morning, wickets continued to fall at regular intervals. Paul Adams took four wickets, Jacques Kallis picked up two, while Lance Klusener, Shaun Pollock, Allan Donald and Daryll Cullinan claimed one each. West Indies were bowled out for 217 in their second innings, giving South Africa a 351-run win and sealing a 5-0 series whitewash over Brian Lara’s side.Match adjudicator Dennis Lindsay awarded the Player of the Match to the entire South African team, an unusual but fitting call. Kallis, who finished the series with 485 runs was the clear choice for Player of the Series.","West Indies were beaten 5-0 by South Africa in the 1999 Test series.

Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan said Nitish Kumar Reddy should have played the ODI series against New Zealand from the first match and can serve as a backup to Hardik Pandya Pathan spoke about Reddy’s performance in the third ODI, saying the youngster showed promise with both bat and ball. Reddy scored a half-century and struck big shots, while also bowling at speeds touching 135 kmph. Pathan said these signs show why India should continue to back him.Reddy played the third and final ODI in Indore on Sunday, scoring 53 off 57 balls with two fours and two sixes. He added 88 runs with Virat Kohli , but the effort was not enough as New Zealand won the match by 41 runs.""Nitish Kumar Reddy was a positive. He scored a fifty with the bat, and Reddy played instead of Washington Sundar in Rajkot. I felt he should have played from the first game. The way he batted, Reddy showed he had the potential to play big shots and can rotate strike. Reddy was also involved in good partnerships in both games. Reddy can play those big shots easily, whether it's the pull shot or playing straight. The way Nitish Kumar Reddy bowled, he touched speeds of 135. It's a decent speed, and it shows he has the potential to be Hardik Pandya's backup.Even if Reddy fails, the management should persist with him, and India will eventually get a good all-rounder,"" Pathan said on his YouTube channel.Reddy made his India debut in T20Is and Tests in 2024 and ended the year with a century in the Boxing Day Test at the MCG against Australia. He has played four ODIs so far, scoring 100 runs at an average of 33.33, including one fifty.In Tests, he has scored 396 runs in 10 matches at an average of 26.40, with one hundred. He has also taken eight wickets at an economy rate of 4.25.New Zealand sealed their first-ever ODI series win in India with a 41-run victory in the third ODI.

The making of Cooper Connolly: Australia’s 22-year-old star

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh Cricket Board has denied reports that the ICC set a January 21 deadline for a decision on the T20 World Cup. The board says no such date was communicated. It has again asked for its matches to be moved to another venue.BCB director Amzad Hossain explained what happened in the last meeting with the ICC.""Last Saturday, January 17, an ICC representative came. A meeting was held with a delegation from our Cricket Board. There, we clearly conveyed our position regarding the World Cup participation and informed them that we are unable to play at the specified venue, and we requested an alternative venue. A detailed discussion took place with their representative. At that time, they told us that they would inform the ICC about these matters and later communicate the decision to us. However, they did not mention any specific date or timeline for when they would inform us—only that they would let us know the next date. Thank you,"" he said.Earlier media reports claimed the ICC had told Bangladesh to decide by January 21 or face removal from the tournament. Some reports also said Bangladesh could be replaced if it refused to travel to India.An ICC source was quoted as saying by news agency PTI, ""The BCB officials have been told to decide on the participation by January 21. If they refuse to travel to India, then they should be ready to be replaced by another team as per rankings.""The dispute has continued for weeks. No solution has been found so far. The issue started after Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman was removed from the 2026 IPL. The decision came from the BCCI. The reason given was unspecified “developments all around.”The BCB says its team will not travel to India. It has cited security concerns and national pride. Bangladesh are scheduled to play group matches in Kolkata and Mumbai.The ICC is reluctant to move those games. The schedule is already finalised. Sri Lanka is co-hosting the tournament. It will also host the India–Pakistan match under an agreement that runs until 2027.Bangladesh have suggested alternatives. They want a venue change or a group change. They are currently in Group C with West Indies, Italy, England and Nepal. The BCB has proposed swapping groups with Ireland in Group B.

'I completely understand the booing': Kylian Mbappé responds to fans’ treatment of Vinícius Júnior,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/i-completely-understand-the-booing-kylian-mbapp-responds-to-fans-treatment-of-vincius-jnior/articleshow/126704155.cms,"Kylian Mbappé of Real Madrid celebrates (Photo by Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty Images)

A tough week

Kylian Mbappé criticized Real Madrid fans for singling out Vinícius Júnior and booing the star forward in the team's Spanish league match on Saturday.Mbappé said fans are entitled to boo when they are unhappy, but should criticize the whole squad and not specific players.“I understand the fans,” Mbappé said Monday ahead of the team's Champions League game against Monaco on Tuesday.“Before I was a player, I was a young guy who watched football, was critical and gave his opinion. I completely understand the booing, but if they're going to do it, they should boo the whole squad, not just a few players. We're all playing poorly.”Madrid beat Levante 2-0 on Saturday to end a slide in form that included a loss to Barcelona in the final of the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia last weekend and an embarrassing elimination against second-division club Albacete in the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday.The crowd at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on Saturday jeered loudly when Vinícius' name was announced before the match against Levante, and again nearly every time the Brazil forward touched the ball.“It's not Vini's fault we're not playing as well as we'd like. The whole squad is to blame,” Mbappé said. “That's the only thing I have to say to the fans. Boo the whole squad. We have to turn the situation around. We're all to blame.We're going to do just that because we're Real Madrid players and there are always moments like this.Mbappé said Vinícius was affected by the boos and said the whole squad had to try to support him.“Vini is a human being,” Mbappé said. “It's normal to be affected when people speak negatively about you. Sometimes it's fair, sometimes it's not. Vini is a fantastic player. He's an incredible man. I'm lucky to know him, and I'm very fond of him. We as a team have to protect him better so he's not in this position of being alone against everyone. We're going to protect him so he can give us his best, because when he's at his best, he's one of the best in the world. ”The fans also booed Jude Bellingham and Federico Valverde on Saturday. The trio was considered by many to be among those who were not behind former coach Xabi Alonso, who was fired following the team's loss to Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup. Alonso was replaced by former B-team coach Álvaro Arbeloa.Mbappé said he spoke with Alonso after his departure and wished him well.“I had a wonderful relationship with him. I wish him all the best because I liked how he viewed the game,” Mbappé said.“He's a coach who's obsessed with the game and the details, and he knows a lot about modern soccer. It's a decision by the club that we have to respect. Now there's a new coach, and we have to support him. We're going to give it our all to ensure things go well for both Arbeloa and Real Madrid.”Mbappé was among the players telling Alonso that they would not do the guard of honor to Barcelona in the awards ceremony at the Spanish Super Cup, an image many said showed a break between Alonso and the players in the locker room.“I'm not going to play dumb,” Mbappé said. “Of course, things go on. There are a lot of things said that ultimately aren't true. I don't think that's right. Our job is to accept it, but when I have the opportunity to speak out, I do so. We have to keep quiet and do our talking on the pitch.”Mbappé said it “hasn't been an easy week” for Madrid and the match against Monaco could prove to be a turning point.“We have to show our character to change these kinds of circumstances and to get everyone back on side,” he said.“I think the fans are eager to give us their support, but we have to earn it. We have to keep fighting for all the titles, and tomorrow the most important thing is the Champions League. We're going to show as a team that we can compete and that we're ready to win all the titles we have left this season.”Madrid sits in seventh place in the league phase of the Champions League. The club trails Barcelona by a point in the Spanish league.","Kylian Mbappé says Real Madrid fans are entitled to boo when they are unhappy.

Lionel Messi India tour: Inside story of what went wrong in Kolkata

Drama unfolded in the Africa Cup of Nations final on Sunday as Senegal survived chaos to win the title. With Senegalese players walking off the pitch, fans clashed with security. However, a missed Panenka penalty changed everything.The final was played at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat. Senegal and Morocco were locked at 0-0 deep into injury time. Morocco were then awarded a penalty after a VAR review. The decision was for a challenge on Brahim Diaz.Senegal were already angry. Minutes earlier, they had a goal ruled out for a soft foul. The referee did not check VAR for that moment. When the penalty was given, Senegal players reacted in fury. Some of them walked off the pitch in protest.The situation grew worse in the stands. Senegal fans tried to enter the field. They clashed with security staff. The match was stopped for almost 20 minutes.Eventually, play resumed. Diaz stepped up to take the penalty.

In the fourth minute, Pape Gueye scored a brilliant goal.It was the only goal of the match. Senegal won 1-0 and lifted the trophy.""We had a feeling of injustice.

""After thinking about it, I realised that I shouldn't have asked them to go off. I apologise for that,"" Thiaw told French broadcaster beIN Sports.""Sometimes you can react in the heat of the moment. Before that we scored a goal that was not given. But now we accept that referees do make mistakes and we apologise.""This was Senegal’s second AFCON title. Their first came four years ago in Cameroon.

LONDON: Aston Villa's Premier League title challenge suffered a huge blow in a 1-0 defeat against Everton, while Newcastle's push towards the top four was derailed by a 0-0 draw at Wolves on Sunday.Unai Emery's side could have closed to within four points of leaders Arsenal if they had beaten Everton at Villa Park.But they wasted the chance to put pressure on the Gunners with a limp performance that was punished by Thierno Barry's second-half winner.After Arsenal's goalless draw at Nottingham Forest on Saturday, Mikel Arteta's men are seven points clear of third-placed Villa.Second-placed Manchester City are also seven points behind the leaders following their 2-0 loss at Manchester United on Saturday.Arsenal are chasing a first English title since 2004 and the stumbles from City and Villa this weekend have tightened their grip on the title race.""There are other teams with more potential than us,"" Emery said of Villa's fading title chances.""We lost a very good opportunity. We did a very good season until now, but today we lost.""We had our chances, we didn't score and they had less chances, but they scored.""Adding to Villa's woes, their captain John McGinn limped off with a first-half injury.Villa had won their previous 11 home games in all competitions.But Everton's Merlin Rohl nearly shattered that feeling of invincibility in just 11 seconds when he capitalised on sloppy defending to shoot against the post.Despite being a boyhood Villa fan, Everton winger Jack Grealish was loudly jeered on his return to his former club.Grealish almost silenced his tormentors with a goal-bound volley that was blocked by Evann Guessand.Everton's Jake O'Brien headed home from a corner, only to see his effort disallowed for offside against Harrison Armstrong.Villa went close just before half-time when Youri Tielemans's cross picked out Guessand and the Ivory Coast forward looped his header onto the bar.But Emery's men lacked a cutting edge and they paid the price in the 59th minute.- Newcastle frustrated -It was a shambolic goal to concede as Pau Torres carelessly surrendered possession just outside his own area.Dwight McNeil pounced with a shot that Emiliano Martinez pushed out to Barry and the striker chipped the ball into the net from close range for his third goal in his last five appearances.Goalkeeper Jordan Pickford preserved Everton's victory with a brilliant tip-over from Morgan Rogers's curler, leaving Villa with only one win from their last four league games.At rain-lashed Molineux, Eddie Howe's Newcastle were unable to prise open the Wolves defence as two points slipped away.Wins over Burnley, Crystal Palace and Leeds had bolstered their bid to qualify for next season's Champions League.But the Magpies are stuck in eighth place after failing to beat bottom-of-the-table Wolves.Following their disappointing 2-0 defeat against Manchester City in the League Cup semi-final first leg on Tuesday, it was another frustrating result for Newcastle.""We needed to do more in attack.

Sorloth winner for Atletico

MADRID: Disallowed goals, hitting the woodwork five times, and great saves.It was just too much for Barcelona to overcome on Sunday as it lost 2-1 to Real Sociedad in the Spanish league to see its 11-game winning streak come to an end.Barcelona had three goals disallowed — as well as a penalty-kick call reversed by video review — in the first half alone. It had five attempts hit the woodwork, including an 84th-minute header by Jules Koundé from close range, and Sociedad goalkeeper Álex Remiro made a series of impressive saves.""Disappointed, we created a lot of opportunities. The result does not reflect our game,"" Barcelona coach Hansi Flick said.""Sometimes it's like that. At the end, there are some days you invest a lot of energy and at the end you are unlucky. I appreciate a lot what I saw.""The loss left the Catalan club one point ahead of second-place Real Madrid, which beat Levante 2-0 at home on Saturday.It was the second consecutive win for Sociedad, which moved to eighth place.""Three amazing points,"" said Remiro. He made one terrific close-range save off a header by Robert Lewandowski in the second half.Mikel Oyarzabal put the hosts ahead with a volley by the far post in the 32nd minute. Barcelona equalized with a header from Marcus Rashford in the 70th but a minute later Gonçalo Guedes put Sociedad ahead again with a shot from inside the area.Barcelona had plenty of chances throughout the match. It thought it had taken the lead a few minutes into the game when Fermín López scored with a low shot from outside the area, but the goal was disallowed by video review for a foul by Dani Olmo on Sociedad's Takefusa Kubo in the buildup.Barcelona also had a goal by Frenkie de Jong called back for offside in the 21st and another by Lamine Yamal in the 27th.Yamal was awarded a penalty in first-half stoppage time but the call was reversed because he was offside.""We played well, had many scoring opportunities,"" De Jong said.""We deserved to win. We need to be able to capitalize on these chances.""Sociedad's Carlos Soler was sent off in the 88th for a hard foul.Barcelona had won 11 in a row across all competitions in a streak that included a 2-1 victory over Real Madrid in the final of the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia last weekend. It hadn't lost since a 3-0 road defeat against Chelsea in the league phase of the Champions League.Its last Spanish league loss had been a 2-1 defeat against Real Madrid in the first clasico of the season at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in October.Barcelona forward Raphinha was not included in the squad for Sunday's match. João Cancelo made his debut off the bench in the second half after recently signing with the Catalan club.Kubo had to be taken off the field on a stretcher in the second half because of an injury.Alexander Sorloth scored early in the second half to give Atletico Madrid a 1-0 home win over relegation-threatened Alaves.Sorloth struck in the 48th minute with a firm header from near the penalty spot after Pablo Barrios crossed from the right flank. The ball hit the post at the far corner before going in.It was the 10th start in 19 league games for Sorloth this season. The Norway forward has six goals, three with headers.Alaves, winless in five straight league games, came close to equalizing a few times late in the match at the Metropolitano stadium in the Spanish capital.Alaves has seven losses in its last nine league games, with its only win, 1-0, against Real Sociedad in December.Earlier Sunday, Valencia moved out of the relegation zone by winning 1-0 at Getafe with an 84th-minute goal by José Gayà.The result ended Valencia's six-game winless streak in the league. Getafe is now winless in six consecutive league games, with five losses.Celta Vigo routed 10-man Rayo Vallecano 3-0 at home.

KOCHI: Manisha Kalyan’s journey has never followed the well-trodden path. Her move from India to Peru is another sharp turn taken with purpose. From Gokulam Kerala’s relentless pressing game to the demanding rhythms of South American football , the left winger has stepped into what she calls the “next level” of learning.Peru’s Alianza Lima Femenino signed Manisha from Greek club PAOK FC, the South American club announced on Friday.Alianza Lima Femenino will be the third overseas club in Manisha’s career. After playing for Sethu FC and Gokulam Kerala at home, the 24-year-old joined Cyprian club Apollon Ladies FC in 2022. She became the first Indian footballer to compete in the UEFA Women’s Champions League. She scored 14 goals in 36 matches for Apollon Ladies.In 2024, Manisha joined Greek club PAOK FC.Manisha, however, gained in prominence at home, when she featured for Gokulam Kerala FC from 2018 to 2022, a club in which she notched up 21 goals in 24 appearances.Now, having already tested herself in Greece, Manisha is clear about her progression. The level in Europe, she admits, was good.""Peru, though, feels different...it's more professional, more exacting, and far less forgiving.Training sessions are longer, sharper, and layered with detail. Fitness is non-negotiable. Technique is constantly refined. Tactical drills, focus on ball positioning, timing and awareness being in the right place at the right time,"" she tells TOI.For Manisha, this is not a leap of faith so much as the next step in a carefully built learning process. She speaks like a player still in her apprenticeship, not someone content with milestones already reached.The move, on a one-year contract, is about absorbing football education in its most purest form. ""There is still a lot to learn and improve and there's no better place to do that than here in Peru. In terms of technique and fitness, I think this is where I want to be at this stage of my career,"" she explains.""How to read space, how to stretch a back line from the left wing, and how to make decisions under pressure are things I'm looking to learn,"" she adds.There is quiet pride, too, in how far she has come. From Hoshiarpur in Punjab to Greece and now Peru, Manisha carries the imprint of Indian footballers who are hungry to improve. Gokulam Kerala shaped her edge and ambition. In Peru, in a more demanding environment, she believes she has found the classroom she was looking for.","Peru's Alianza Lima Femenino sign Manisha Kalyan from Greek club PAOK FC.

- A step forward -

MADRID: Angry Real Madrid fans jeered their own team before they went on to beat Levante 2-0 in La Liga on Saturday to record new coach Alvaro Arbeloa's first win at the helm. Villarreal, third, stumbled to a 2-0 defeat at Real Betis, hampering their attempts at mounting a title challenge.Arbeloa's debut after replacing Xabi Alonso ended in a humiliating Copa del Rey defeat in midweek at second-tier Albacete, but second-half goals from Kylian Mbappe and Raul Asencio secured Madrid three vital points at a moody Santiago Bernabeu.Second-place Madrid cut the gap on leaders Barcelona to one point before the in-form Spanish champions visit Real Sociedad on Sunday.Star players Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham came in for ire from the home fans after a disastrous week. Mbappe also started but was spared the jeers.The French forward had been expected to return for the Champions League game against Monaco next week as he manages his recovery from a knee sprain.""I've always respected the Bernabeu (crowd), they whistled me a lot too (as a player), and it's one of the aspects that make this club so great, how demanding the fans are,"" said Arbeloa, defending the right of the fans to express themselves.It was Arbeloa's 43rd birthday and he was eventually able to celebrate with a victory, although his team lacked energy and spark in the first half.That was not the case in the stands as a significant part of the crowd harangued their own team, in response to a wild week at the club.Los Blancos lost the Spanish Super Cup final to rivals Barcelona in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, parted ways with Alonso on Monday and then crashed out of the cup on Wednesday.Some fans also chanted for president Florentino Perez to resign in a sour atmosphere in the Spanish capital.Mbappe had the best chance of a flat first half against the team in 19th in La Liga. Reaching a long ball the French superstar met it with a volley that flew wide of the post.Home fans jeered their side in at the break and Madrid emerged for the second half with more impetus, with Arbeloa bringing on Franco Mastantuono and Arda Guler.Mbappe drew a foul in the area from Adrian de la Fuente to earn a penalty, which he dispatched for his 19th league goal of the campaign.Mbappe has scored 50 goals in 53 La Liga games, taking only a little longer than Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer Cristiano Ronaldo to reach the milestone.The Portuguese managed it in 51 appearances.Asencio doubled Madrid's advantage with a header into the top corner from Guler's corner as the hosts took control.Bellingham came close to adding a third but Mathew Ryan parried his header and then saved Vinicius's effort after a darting run from the Brazilian.Ryan thwarted Bellingham again as tensions calmed by the end, with the crowd temporarily sated by the victory. Unless Madrid can build on it, the jeers and whistles will return.""Today was a very important day, playing in front of our fans, we wanted to turn around the situation,"" Asencio told Real Madrid TV.""What happened at Albacete should not have happened, we felt guilty and we wanted to make things better.""Elsewhere, Vedat Muriqi scored a hat-trick for Mallorca in a 3-2 win over Athletic Bilbao, before Villarreal fell to defeat at La Cartuja.Aitor Ruibal and Pablo Fornals's second-half goals helped Betis earn an impressive victory over Marcelino Garcia Toral's visitors.The loss leaves Villarreal eight points behind leaders Barcelona and damaged their chances of competing for a first-ever La Liga title.Betis had more of the ball in an otherwise even first half before Ruibal volleyed them ahead after 57 minutes.Santi Comesana's red card for a rash challenge on Giovani Lo Celso made Villarreal's job harder and Fornals killed the game by drilling home with precision from outside the area with seven minutes remaining.""It was a hard-fought game, the details led to Betis winning, I think a draw would have been fairest,"" Villarreal midfielder Dani Parejo told Movistar.""We lacked the finishing touch but had some clear chances... I think the team showed up well, but in both boxes we weren't quite good enough.""","Real Madrid beat Levante 2-0 in La Liga on Saturday to record new coach Alvaro Arbeloa's first win at the helm.

'India's dream of FIFA World Cup is still alive': Veteran footballer Ashalata Devi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/indias-dream-of-fifa-world-cup-is-still-alive-veteran-footballer-ashalata-devi/articleshow/126613772.cms,"Ashalata Devi (PTI Photo)

Indian women’s football stalwart Ashalata Devi says the dream of seeing the country play at the FIFA Women’s World Cup remains alive, but stressed that sustained progress at the grassroots level is crucial to bridge the gap with the world’s elite.“Our dream of the World Cup is still alive. We still have to work even harder at this time,” Ashalata told PTI.The veteran defender pointed out that all three national teams -- Under-17, Under-19 and the senior side -- have qualified for their respective AFC Asian Championships, making 2026 a potentially defining year for the women’s game in India.“Under-17, Under-19 and the senior team have already qualified for AFC (competitions). If we do well there, obviously our dream of the World Cup is still alive,” she said.One of the most capped players in Indian women’s football history, Ashalata -- who has earned over 100 international caps and captained the national side on multiple occasions -- said the (senior) team has made steady progress but is still short of world-class standards.“We have been doing better for a long time, but still according to world-class levels, we are not there yet.Still, we are trying a lot,” she said.“I have so much faith in the players. Their passion, hard work and dedication — they have been working for so many years. I really hope this time we qualify for the World Cup and do better for Indian women’s football.”Having spent more than a decade anchoring India’s defence, Ashalata identified grassroots development as the biggest area needing immediate attention.“The problem is that we skip the basics and go straight to the technical aspects,” she said.“In my time, I started playing football at the age of 13. Now many players start at 10 or 11. But if we start at five or six years, learning becomes much better.”She emphasised that skill acquisition becomes increasingly difficult with age.“After 17 or 18 years, teaching skills like ball control becomes very difficult. By then, players play more by expression than learning. That’s why grassroots football is very important,” she added.While acknowledging the role of the All India Football Federation (AIFF), the senior pro said responsibility must also lie with state associations.“AIFF has a big role, but every state has its own association. They must show interest and take initiative. Everything cannot be done only at the top level,” Ashalata said, adding that consistency at the state level is essential to create a sustainable pipeline of talent.Off the field, Ashalata has already begun planning her contribution to the game beyond her playing career through the Ashalata Devi Football Festival (ADFF), which she started along with fellow India international Aditi Chauhan in Imphal.“I never knew what I would do after retirement other than football. I still feel connected to football and I wanted to do something for it,” she said.Drawing from her own experiences, Ashalata said the Festival aims to ensure young players do not have to choose between football and education.“When I was young, I couldn’t manage football and school together because there was no academy near my house. I don’t want the next generation to face what I struggled with,” she said.The initiative, which focuses on combining football training with education, has already exceeded expectations.“I planned for around 50 players, but almost 47–48 kids came. I never expected such a response, and I’m really happy,” Ashalata signed off.","Ashalata Devi is one of the most capped players in Indian women’s football history. The veteran defender has earned over 100 international caps and captained the national side on multiple occasions. All three national teams -- Under-17, Under-19 and the senior side -- have qualified for their respective AFC Asian Championships.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126614242,imgsize-24626,width-400,resizemode-4/ashalata-devi-pti-photo.jpg"

AIFF to control both ISL, I-League



AIFF retains control in ISL functioning



I-League clubs have more say



ISL clubs not fully behind proposed structure



Poll Do you think AIFF should have more control over the Indian Super League (ISL)? Yes, more control is necessary No, clubs should have more say

I-League proposed to begin on February 19



The All India Football Federation (AIFF) proposed a participation framework structure for both the top-tier Indian Super League (ISL) and the second-division I-League over the past couple of days. While these are still proposals and have not yet been approved by the clubs concerned, they differ in how much control the AIFF wants to exercise over the two tiers of Indian football.In both proposed frameworks, clubs and commercial partners have representation. However, the stark difference lies in the level of control afforded.In the proposed ISL framework, the AIFF has retained final authority and veto power on key decisions, which is not the case in the I-League proposal.The AIFF has proposed two bodies for the ISL, one Governing Council and another to run day-to-day operations.The Governing Council will comprise the AIFF President or Secretary General, AIFF Vice President, AIFF Treasurer, one representative from each club, three representatives from the rights partner or broadcaster, for which a request for proposal is yet to be floated, and two independent members.The Management Committee will be responsible for the league’s day-to-day operations.It will include the AIFF Secretary General, the AIFF Head of Competitions, the AIFF Head of Strategy, five club representatives and three rights partner representatives.While the ISL Governing Council is expected to convene infrequently, the AIFF has effectively retained control. All decisions require a simple majority, but at least two affirmative votes must come from AIFF representatives. As a result, AIFF officials will largely determine outcomes.Revenue sharing, prize money allocation, significant budget alterations, broadcast or commercial rights matters, long-term agreements and contracts above Rs 1 crore will all require the AIFF’s affirmative vote.Even though the AIFF will fully own and operate the I-League, the clubs will collectively be responsible for commercial and operational decisions.As with the ISL structure, the AIFF will have a say in matters pertaining to sporting integrity, regulatory compliance and disciplinary jurisdiction. However, the AIFF has chosen not to exercise veto powers in matters relating to broadcast rights, digital or media rights, sponsorships, marketing, branding or commercial exploitation.Not all ISL clubs are satisfied with the current proposal shared by the AIFF. One official, who chose to remain anonymous, noted that the structure is not new and had previously been discussed under Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL). The official added that the limited influence afforded to the commercial partner could once again prove to be a hurdle when the AIFF invites bidders.Another ISL club official offered a different perspective, comparing the current proposal to the FSDL era, when clubs had little say in most governance matters.On Friday, the AIFF also informed I-League clubs about the proposed schedule for the second division of Indian football. The 11-team league is expected to begin on February 19 and run for 80 days.The I-League will be played in a home-and-away format, with five home and five away matches for all teams. In a reminder of the COVID-affected 2020-21 season, the top six teams will progress to the playoffs, while the bottom five will fight to avoid relegation.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) proposed a participation framework structure for both the top-tier Indian Super League (ISL) and the second- division I-League over the past couple of days.

What’s stopping Mike Tomlin from becoming the Buffalo Bills’ next head coach?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/whats-stopping-mike-tomlin-from-becoming-the-buffalo-bills-next-head-coach/articleshow/126752053.cms,"What’s stopping Mike Tomlin from becoming the Buffalo Bills’ next head coach?(Image via Joe Sargent/Getty)

Why the Tomlin-Bills buzz never turned real

The Buffalo Bills entered unfamiliar territory. Sean McDermott was fired just days after Buffalo’s season ended with a playoff loss to the Denver Broncos. The move shocked the locker room and split the fan base. It also opened one of the most attractive head coaching jobs in the NFL Almost immediately, one name dominated the conversation. Mike Tomlin. Proven. Respected. A Super Bowl winner. On the surface, it felt logical. Buffalo has a franchise quarterback in Josh Allen and a roster built to win now. Tomlin has navigated pressure markets for nearly two decades.But the noise never matched reality.Behind the scenes, multiple obstacles made a Tomlin-to-Buffalo pairing close to impossible, despite how clean it looked on paper.The first issue is contractual. Tomlin stepped away from the Pittsburgh Steelers after the 2025 season, but he did not become a free agent. Because he did not coach another team, Pittsburgh still controls his NFL coaching rights for the 2026 season. Any team interested would need to trade for him.That alone complicates things. The Bills and Steelers are in the AFC and have met in high-stakes games. Trading a high-profile coach to a conference rival is not standard practice.NFL insider Tom Pelissero addressed this on The Rich Eisen Show.“Question one is, would the Rooneys even trade Mike Tomlin to Buffalo?” Pelissero said during the show. “That is very close geographically, and it’s one of your AFC rivals.”Then comes the recent performance. Tomlin’s résumé is historic, but recency matters. His Steelers teams failed to win a playoff game over the past nine seasons. During that same stretch, McDermott led Buffalo to multiple deep playoff runs. From a results standpoint, the upgrade argument was never clean.The final hurdle is personal. According to Pelissero on the same Rich Eisen Show appearance, Tomlin is not mentally preparing to coach in 2026.“At this point, I don’t believe that Mike Tomlin is in a mental space where he wants to coach in 2026,” Pelissero said, noting Tomlin may step away entirely for a year.That matters for Buffalo. The Bills are not rebuilding. Josh Allen turns 30 in May 2026. This roster needs a coach ready to install systems immediately and chase a Super Bowl from Day 1.For Buffalo, the intrigue faded once reality set in. The name carried weight, but the timing never worked. The Bills will now pivot toward candidates without contractual baggage and who are immediately available. Mike Tomlin may coach again, just not in Buffalo.","The Buffalo Bills fired Sean McDermott just days after the season ended. Mike Tomlin was considered a logical choice to replace McDermott.

The Miami Dolphins hired Jeff Hafley to replace Mike McDaniel, as Micah Parsons shared a heartfelt message



The Miami Dolphins moved fast once the Mike McDaniel era officially ended. Now, the franchise had its next head coach in place. The Dolphins hired the Packers' DC Jeff Hafley, signaling a clear shift in direction after a messy 2025 season.The news sent ripples across the league, including inside the Packers locker room. One reaction stood out. Micah Parsons, who played under Hafley in Green Bay, shared a rare, personal response that reflected both respect and loss. It was not scripted. It felt real. And it explained why Miami believes it made the right call.ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that the Dolphins finalized Hafley’s hiring after a second interview with team leadership. The move came days after Miami parted ways with McDaniel, who finished his four-year run with a 35–33 record and just one winning season over the last two years.Shortly after the news broke, Micah Parsons reacted on X. The comment came the same day and reflected his experience playing in Hafley’s system.“Genuinely happy for Haf. Great guy, great person. Gonna miss his energy,” Parsons wrote in a social media post following the announcement.Parsons worked with Hafley during his time in Green Bay after arriving from Dallas via trade. The linebacker signed a four-year, $188 million contract and immediately became the centerpiece of Hafley’s defense. In the 2024 season, Parsons posted 41 total tackles, 12.5 sacks, and 12 tackles for loss while anchoring a unit that finished fifth in total defense.That success shaped Hafley’s growing reputation. Green Bay allowed just 314.5 yards per game in 2024 and returned to the playoffs. The defense slipped to 12th in 2025, but the Packers still reached the postseason. Around the league, Hafley earned credit for accountability and clarity, traits Miami lacked late in the McDaniel era.Dolphins owner Stephen Ross addressed the hire in a team statement.“I believe great things are ahead for the Miami Dolphins with Jeff Hafley leading the way,” Ross said during the official team announcement. “Jeff is a proven leader and motivator.”Miami also hired Jon-Eric Sullivan as general manager, another move tied to Green Bay’s front office. The Dolphins now lean on structure, discipline, and defense to reset a franchise that went 7–10 in 2025. Parsons’ reaction said it best. Hafley leaves respect behind. Miami hopes he brings results next.","Miami Dolphins hired Green Bay Packers DC Jeff Hafley to replace Mike McDaniel.

Raiders buzz grows as Ravens face hard reset



The Baltimore Ravens are entering unfamiliar territory, and the timing matters. For the first time in over a decade, the franchise is preparing for life without John Harbaugh. That shift has pushed uncomfortable questions to the surface, none bigger than the future of Lamar Jackson Around the league, those questions have sparked trade chatter that once felt impossible. On Jan 19, multiple league observers began connecting Jackson to the Las Vegas Raiders, a franchise now influenced by minority owner Tom Brady and searching for a defining move.The Baltimore Ravens have built their modern identity around Lamar Jackson, from their offensive design to roster construction. But coaching changes often bring philosophical resets. Executives across the league know that new regimes prefer clean slates, especially at quarterback.That reality explains why the Raiders have entered the conversation. Las Vegas holds the top overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft and has the flexibility few teams can match. Brady’s presence has only added fuel to the speculation, as league insiders believe the Raiders want a bold move that reshapes relevance in the AFC West.Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk addressed the mechanics of a potential deal. He outlined how a trade could legally take shape before the league year opens.“In theory, the Raiders and the Ravens could agree to the terms of a Lamar Jackson trade at any time, with the understanding that it will be finalized on March 11, the first day of the league year,” per Florio. “If Brady wants to take a big swing and if Jackson is ready to take his bat and ball to a new city, it’s something to keep an eye on.”Baltimore would hold significant leverage. Any deal would likely start with the Raiders’ top pick, with additional selections attached. That package could allow the Ravens to draft quarterback Fernando Mendoza or trade down and stockpile premium assets.Jackson’s 2025 season added context to the discussion. Baltimore struggled with consistency, and durability questions resurfaced as the year wore on. While Jackson remains one of the league’s most dangerous players, the Ravens must now weigh peak value against long-term sustainability.The emotional cost would be massive. Jackson delivered an MVP, playoff success, and a unique identity. Front offices also understand a harsh truth. Replacing elite quarterbacks rarely works on paper.Still, if Baltimore believes its competitive window has shifted, trading Jackson could accelerate a retool instead of prolonging uncertainty. For now, it remains a rumor. But as January closes and March approaches, this is one story the league will not ignore.","Lamar Jackson's uncertain future sparks blockbuster trade talk, with Tom Brady’s Raiders.

Troy Aikman closes the booth as Monday Night Football ends

The NFL postseason is flying. One weekend, you are watching the wild-card chaos. Next, the conference championships are already here. That fast pace brings excitement. It also brings reminders that the season is closing in.One of those reminders arrived quietly on Jan 19, 2026. Troy Aikman’s year in the Monday Night Football booth came to an end. No farewell segment on air. Just a short moment shared online that confirmed ESPN’s NFL broadcast season is done. Aikman marked it himself.On Monday, Aikman posted an Instagram story after ESPN aired its final Monday Night Football game of the season. He reposted a photo with longtime broadcast partner Joe Buck and wrote, “That’s a wrap in the booth!” The post went live hours after the divisional round wrapped up.That moment mattered because there are no Monday games left. The NFL does not schedule Monday Night Football during the divisional or conference rounds. The league avoids giving one team extra rest while another plays on a short week. The playoff format stays tight. Saturday and Sunday only. Always.With that structure, ESPN’s NFL season officially closed last week.Aikman and Buck will not call another game together until the 2026 regular season begins in September.That absence feels noticeable. Over the last few years, Monday nights carried a different tone. Aikman stayed direct. He questioned calls. He challenged officials. He never softened opinions.During a Sports Business Radio podcast appearance on Dec. 12, 2025, Aikman explained his approach. “I never try to make anything personal,” he said during the interview. “I try to be honest. I try to be fair. That fan at home cares deeply about their team.” That honesty became his signature.But the future holds more questions than answers. On the same podcast, Aikman admitted broadcasting may not be his final chapter. He said he is interested in working for an NFL team, even though the learning curve feels steep at his age.That idea moved closer to reality earlier this month. In Jan. 2026, the Miami Dolphins brought Aikman in as a temporary consultant during their general manager search. The role ended once Jon-Eric Sullivan took the job. Still, the experience mattered.For now, Aikman remains ESPN’s voice on Mondays. But as the playoffs roll on without him in the booth, one thing feels clear. This season did not end for ESPN alone. It reopened a door Aikman has not closed.","Troy Aikman posted an Instagram story after ESPN aired its final Monday Night Football game of the season.

Caleb Williams’ net worth and career earnings

Saquon Barkley’s net worth and career earnings

Who is richer right now?

Caleb Williams and Saquon Barkley are two of the most famous players in the NFL right now. Both stars come from different generations and positions. One is a rookie quarterback who is just starting out in the NFL, while the other is a running back who has already won a Super Bowl. They have also made a lot of money since they have done well on the field. This is a closer look at how their salary, contracts, endorsements, and net worth compare.Caleb Williams entered the NFL in 2024 as the first overall pick and quickly became the face of the Chicago Bears. According to Celebrity Net Worth , Williams net worth is around $14 million in 2026. Most of his wealth comes from his rookie contract, which was one of the richest for a first-year quarterback.He signed a four-year deal worth about $39.5 million, fully guaranteed. He received a massive signing bonus of nearly $25.5 million, which helped him earn more than $26 million in his first season alone. For the 2025–26 season, his salary and bonuses are close to $9.8 million.As a young star, he is also building his brand. He already has endorsement deals with major sports and lifestyle companies, and his market value is expected to rise fast if he continues to perform well.At just 24 years old, he is still at the beginning of what could become a very lucrative career.Saquon Barkley has been in the league since 2018 and has built a much larger financial base. According to Celebrity Net Worth , his net worth is estimated at around $30 million. His earnings come from several big contracts and years of steady performance.Barkley started with a four-year rookie deal worth $31.2 million with the New York Giants. After playing under the franchise tag in 2023, he joined the Philadelphia Eagles in 2024 on a three-year contract worth $37.75 million. Following a record-breaking season and a Super Bowl win, he signed a two-year extension in 2025 worth $41.2 million, with most of the money guaranteed.By now, his total career earnings have crossed $60 million. He also earns from endorsements and partnerships, including early investments and brand deals that add to his income.At this stage, Barkley is clearly ahead in terms of net worth and total earnings. His long career, Super Bowl success, and massive contracts have given him a strong financial lead. Williams, however, has time on his side. As a franchise quarterback, he is likely to sign a huge extension in the coming years that could quickly push his net worth much higher.While Barkley enjoys the rewards of a proven career, Williams represents the future. If his development continues, this financial gap may not last very long.","Caleb Williams entered the NFL in 2024 as the first overall pick and quickly became the face of the Chicago Bears.

John Harbaugh's New York Giants era puts family and future in focus



John Harbaugh's New York Giants era has officially begun, and the first signs point to a cultural reset inside one of football’s most scrutinized franchises. The moment the deal became final on January 17, the Giants signaled that stability and experience now sit at the center of their long-term vision. After years of inconsistency, New York turned to a coach known for structure, accountability, and sustained relevance in the NFL.Harbaugh arrives with context that matters. His exit from Baltimore followed an 8–9 finish in 2025, the Ravens’ first missed postseason since 2021. Injuries to Lamar Jackson shaped that outcome, but after 18 seasons, both sides understood change was inevitable. For the Giants, it was not about chasing trends. It was about leadership, credibility, and setting a tone that can last beyond one season.The hiring did more than reshape the Giants’ coaching staff. It pushed the Harbaugh family into a new spotlight. Fans quickly turned their attention to his inner circle, including his daughter Alison, a former Notre Dame lacrosse player who later continued her academic and athletic journey at the University of South Florida.Just as visible is Ingrid Harbaugh, whose steady presence has followed John through every chapter of his coaching life.Their story began years ago at Western Michigan. John was working as a graduate assistant under his father Jack, while Ingrid held a role in the baseball office as a student. What started on campus became a lifelong partnership that has now landed in New York. That connection felt front and center when the Giants shared a video of the couple together, welcoming them with the caption, ""Coach Harbaugh has arrived"".Beyond the emotion lies real football intrigue. Harbaugh steps into a roster filled with young talent and unfinished promise. Jaxson Dart represents a quarterback project with upside. Malik Nabers, if healthy, gives the offense a dynamic edge. The appeal of this move rests in Harbaugh’s ability to develop players while demanding discipline from day one.Expectations will rise quickly. The Giants are not asking for miracles. They are asking for direction. With Harbaugh, they finally believe they have it.",John Harbaugh's New York Giants era has officially begun.

NFL insider explains why Travis Kelce retirement must wait



Travis Kelce's retirement talk has shifted from quiet whispers to a full league wide debate, and Kansas City suddenly finds itself at the center of it. The Chiefs are not chasing another Lombardi Trophy this January. Instead, they are watching the postseason unfold from home while one question looms larger than any offseason move. Will their most reliable offensive voice return for one more run?The uncertainty feels heavier because it is not just about numbers or legacy. It is about timing, trust, and whether a dynasty still has one more chapter left to write. As the Chiefs regroup from a painful exit, insiders believe this decision could shape the franchise well before free agency truly begins.NFL insider Nate Taylor believes Kansas City cannot afford to stay passive. Writing for ESPN, Taylor pointed to one clear priority that should rise above all others as the offseason unfolds.“Convince tight end Travis Kelce to return. The odds might not be in the Chiefs’ favor, but he is still productive and someone Patrick Mahomes trusts over any other pass catcher,” Taylor wrote. “A reasonable one-year contract could lead to Kelce returning to the roster for Mahomes’ return following his recovery from a left knee injury,” he added.Kelce has not rushed the process. Speaking on the January 7 episode of the New Heights podcast, he made it clear that reflection comes first. “Just being a regular human for a couple weeks, maybe a month or so, trying to figure out what I’m gonna do next in terms of my future in football,” he said while talking with his brother Jason.He also revealed that conversations inside the building have already started. “And I think, you know, I’ve talked to a few people in the facility already, you know, having the exit meetings and everything, and they know where I stand at least right now.”Still, the door remains open. Kelce sounded far from done when discussing his body and motivation. “At the same time, if my body can heal up and rest up and I can feel confident that I can go out there and give it another 18, 20, 21-week run, I think I would do it in a heartbeat.”Even in a difficult year, Kelce finished with 851 receiving yards and ran more routes than nearly any tight end in football. More importantly, he remains Patrick Mahomes’ emotional anchor. If Kansas City hopes to steady itself after a rare stumble, stopping Travis Kelce retirement may be the most important win they secure all year.",Travis Kelce's retirement talk has shifted from quiet whispers to a full league wide debate.

George Kittle Achilles surgery brings encouraging recovery outlook



George Kittle Achilles surgery gave the kind of update San Francisco needed at the heart of a tense offseason. The 49ers star tight end spoke with calm confidence, offering reassurance not just through optimism, but through detail. His words reflected relief, clarity, and a mindset locked on recovery rather than regret. For a player whose presence defines toughness and joy, the tone mattered as much as the medical news itself.The injury happened in the heat of playoff football, yet Kittle’s response has been measured and upbeat. From the moment he addressed reporters, his message carried substance. There was no guessing, no empty promises. Instead, he explained why his recovery outlook looks encouraging and why patience, not panic, should guide expectations as the process unfolds.“Overall, I’m fantastic,” Kittle, who tore his Achilles during the Niners’ wild-card win over the Eagles in the first round of the playoffs, told reporters on Monday. “The surgery went really, really good. The surgeon was incredibly happy with it.”That confidence stems from the nature of the injury itself.“[The surgeon] said that the best-case scenario when you tear an Achilles is that you tear it up high, by your soleus, which is what I did. I had a clean tear. They didn't have to drill into my heel. And where the repair was is where there’s more blood flow. And so it takes some time off the recovery time.” The procedure was performed last week in Los Angeles by Dr. Neal ElAttrache, a trusted name in elite sports medicine.Kittle knew instantly when something was wrong. “It felt like someone put a shotgun up against my calf and pulled the trigger,” he said. “Unfortunate,” he added, “but football’s tough sometimes.” Even in that moment, his awareness was sharp and honest.While timelines remain guarded, hope is evident. He joked about keeping his return date “as a surprise,” later pushing back on the idea of a midseason comeback by suggesting it could happen “well before November.” That hint alone lifted spirits across the fan base.There was also a lighter note after the injury. “Yep, it happened,” Kittle said of enjoying tequila in the locker room as he watched his teammates close out the win. “I had a great time.”At 32, and coming off a season where he still ranked among the team’s top receivers, Kittle’s influence remains strong. Rehab will test patience, but his attitude already signals leadership. The body will heal in time. The belief is already there.","George Kittle tore his Achilles during the 49ers' wild-card win over the Eagles.

Jessica Pegula sends clear message about controversial Bills call



Jess Pegula Press Conference | Australian Open 2026 First Round

The controversial Buffalo Bills call still echoes far beyond the NFL field, and this time it surfaced on a tennis court in Melbourne. The overtime loss to the Denver Broncos on January 17 did more than end a season. It left a bruise that fans still feel days later. A disputed interception call involving Josh Allen and Brandin Cooks flipped momentum, then history, in a game the Bills fought hard to extend.As the Broncos walked away with a 33-30 playoff win, frustration settled in across Buffalo. The ruling stood. The season has closed. Yet the moment refused to fade, especially for those with personal ties to the franchise. Among them stood Bills heiress Jessica Pegula, watching from a different world but feeling the same sting.Pegula, ranked No. 6 in the world and fresh off a first round win over Anastasia Zakharova at the Australian Open, did not need a microphone to make her point. After sealing the victory, she turned to the on court camera and wrote, “That was a catch.” with a sad face. The message was brief, sharp, and loaded with meaning. It mirrored what much of Bills Mafia believed after Brandin Cooks appeared to secure the ball before hitting the turf, only for the call to go the other way.Her frustration did not stop there. Asked later about the loss, Pegula spoke as a fan first, not an elite athlete. “Yeah, yesterday sucked, not going to lie. I was not happy. Not a happy camper.“Tough game. Tough loss. How we lost was also — you know, it just was like a stab in the heart kind of situation. It just wasn’t fun, yeah.”The emotion felt raw, honest, and deeply personal. For Pegula, the game unfolded while she was preparing for her own match. “I was actually practicing from 11:00 to 12:00, so actually I practiced with an earbud in and had the stream on my phone so I could just at least hear what was going on, because it was pretty much to the end right before we went into the overtime,” said Pegula. “Then the game pretty much ended. It was an important part of the game.“I don’t know why my coach booked practice that time. That was his fault, but it was the only time we could get a court.”Despite the heartbreak, Pegula made one thing clear. The loss does not derail her focus, even if it lights a fire. “Yeah, I mean, it doesn’t affect me when I’m out there on court, but you do get, like, a little fired up,” she said, before adding, “When it comes match day, you kind of forget about all that. I have other things to kind of focus on.”For Bills fans, that mix of pain and resilience feels all too familiar.","Bills heiress Jessica Pegula is ranked No. 6 in the world and fresh off a first round win over Anastasia Zakharova at the Australian Open.

Sean McDermott firing closes a defining chapter in Buffalo



Sean McDermott's firing has left Western New York quiet, reflective, and searching for meaning after a season that ended in heartbreak rather than celebration. It is rare for a city to grieve a coach, yet Buffalo finds itself doing exactly that. Just two days after an overtime playoff loss to the Broncos, the Bills made a decision that reshaped their future. The move was swift, emotional, and heavy with consequence. McDermott, the man who helped restore pride and belief, was dismissed without ever delivering the Super Bowl the city craved.For nine seasons, McDermott stood as the face of Buffalo’s football rebirth. When he arrived in 2017, the Bills carried the weight of the NFL ’s longest playoff drought. That burden lifted quickly. Playoff appearances became routine. Winning seasons followed one after another. Still, January failures lingered. From the infamous 13 seconds collapse to the most recent postseason sting, those moments slowly defined his legacy as much as his success.Hours after his dismissal, McDermott released a statement that captured the bond he built with the franchise and its people.“For nearly a decade I have had the opportunity to wake up every morning as the Head Coach of the Buffalo Bills, which has truly been a gift,” McDermott wrote.“I want to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to the Pegula family, the Buffalo Bills organization, and to the fans for allowing me to live out the dream of being a Head Coach in the NFL in this incredibly special place.“I am proud and humbled to have worked alongside amazing staff and players as we shared life together and poured out our hearts and souls into both winning football games and making a positive impact in our community. This community graciously embraced not only me but my family and in some ways helped raise our children over the last nine years. For that I say thank you to all of the teachers, coaches, and friends whom we met along the way … the City of Good Neighbors! We Love You! We will miss Buffalo.“Bills Mafia, you are one of one! It has been a joy and inspiration to witness your passion and commitment first hand. I always wanted our teams to play with the sam level of toughness and grit that is true to Buffalo and that you demonstrate every day!“God gave me and my family an incredible opportunity, one that we will cherish for the rest of our lives. Yet we know that HE has a plan.“Thank you for allowing me to serve as your head coach. God bless, Sean McDermott.”McDermott exits as the second winningest coach in franchise history, posting a 98-50 record and seven straight double digit win seasons. More than numbers, he reshaped how Buffalo sees itself. He defended the city, earned the respect of his players, and raised expectations that once felt unreachable. He may not have finished the journey, but he changed the road forever.",Sean McDermott released a statement after being fired by the Buffalo Bills.

Mike Tomlin’s long-protected reputation is finally being questioned as former Steelers players start to speak up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/mike-tomlins-long-protected-reputation-is-finally-being-questioned-as-former-steelers-players-start-to-speak-up/articleshow/126685872.cms,"Mike Tomlin’s long-standing reputation is facing fresh scrutiny as insiders reveal some former Steelers players quietly held back criticism. With an eight-year playoff win drought and growing public comments from ex-players like Ryan Clark, questions are emerging about whether Tomlin’s message has grown stale and if Pittsburgh has reached its ceiling under his leadership.

Former Steelers are starting to speak up about what it was really like under Mike Tomlin

93.7 The Fan Live Stream

Mike Tomlin has long been protected by reputation. Around the league, his name still carries weight. Inside Pittsburgh, however, the conversation is shifting. As the Steelers move towards the 2026 offseason, a series of comments from insiders and former players have cracked open a debate many believed had been buried for years. Behind closed doors, not every former Steeler remembers the Mike Tomlin era fondly.According to respected NFL reporter Aditi Kinkhabwala, several ex players have stayed silent despite lingering frustrations. “I’ll just say this without violating anybody’s trust. There are many, many former players that I have spoken to that have bitten their tongues about their experience with Mike (Tomlin),” she said on 93.7 The Fan. “There’s a huge disconnect, right? Because the national media is in love with Mike Tomlin and the national media never brings up the playoff drought. ”That disconnect is no longer quiet. With the Pittsburgh Steelers stuck in an eight year playoff win drought, patience is thinning. Tomlin’s consistency once shielded him from scrutiny. Now it is fueling it. Six straight postseason losses have pushed him into an uncomfortable historical company, a reality fans and analysts can no longer ignore.The most pointed criticism has come from inside the Steelers family itself. Former team captain Ryan Clark questioned whether Tomlin’s voice has simply worn out its welcome. “I believe Mike Tomlin should coach in another organization,” Clark said in May.“Mike Tomlin should be the fresh voice somewhere else. I believe, as great as a coach as he is, and he’s a first-ballot Hall of Famer, I believe his voice has run stale there. I believe he’s allowed that team to reach the highest of heights they are going to reach unless they get a top-tier quarterback.”For Tomlin, the issue is no longer respect. It is results. The Steelers have not won a playoff game since 2016, and Tomlin now owns the longest active postseason losing streak of his career. National praise still exists, but it is no longer unanimous.As training camp approaches, one truth is clear. The silence from former players is fading. And the questions surrounding Mike Tomlin are no longer coming from the outside looking in.","Mike Tomlin’s long-standing reputation is facing fresh scrutiny as insiders reveal some former Steelers players quietly held back criticism.

Are Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson engaged? A renamed boat and a diamond ring raised eyebrows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/are-bill-belichick-and-jordon-hudson-engaged-a-renamed-boat-and-a-diamond-ring-raised-eyebrows/articleshow/126684063.cms,"Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson are fueling engagement speculation after she was spotted wearing a diamond ring on her left hand in late May 2025. Reports claim Hudson has privately said they are engaged, though neither has confirmed it. From repeated ring sightings to a renamed boat, small details are keeping the rumors alive.

Why Jordon Hudson’s airport photos have everyone talking about Bill Belichick

Bill Belichick has built a career on silence, discipline, and control. That approach is suddenly being tested far from the football field. In late May 2025, a single detail spotted in an airport terminal reignited intense speculation about the legendary coach’s personal life. It was not a statement or an announcement. It was a ring.At the center of the chatter is Bill Belichick and his much younger girlfriend, Jordon Hudson. When Hudson, 24, was photographed at Raleigh Durham Airport wearing a sparkly ring on her left hand, the images spread quickly. The timing only added fuel. Reports had already surfaced claiming Hudson privately told at least one person the couple was engaged. Neither she nor Belichick, now 73, has addressed the rumors.The speculation has not slowed. Hudson has been seen wearing the same ring at multiple high profile events in New York, including a museum luncheon and a dinner outing. Adding intrigue, Belichick recently renamed his boat. Once called VIII Rings, a tribute to his Super Bowl titles, it is now I + VIII Rings. Fans immediately noticed the symbolism.Despite the noise, Hudson has shown she is comfortable leaning into the spotlight on her own terms.Earlier this year, she marked the couple’s anniversary with humor, writing, “Happy Meetiversary @billbelichick — Cheers 🥂 to the fact that you still let me give you lengthy philosophical lectures four years later,” referencing how they first met.Public curiosity intensified after an awkward moment on CBS News Sunday Morning. When Belichick was asked how the couple met, Hudson shut it down instantly. “We’re not talking about this,” she said, interrupting the interview. The clip went viral and sparked debate about boundaries and influence.Belichick later responded to criticism that the relationship might distract him from coaching duties at the University of North Carolina. “I mean, that’s really off to the side,” he told ESPN. “It’s a personal relationship, and she [Jordon] doesn’t have anything to do with UNC football.""For now, the ring remains unexplained. The silence feels intentional. And in a relationship already under a microscope, every detail continues to speak louder than words.","Jordon Hudson, 24, was photographed at Raleigh Durham Airport wearing a sparkly ring on her left hand in late May 2025.

“Wearing a holy thing for a bad purpose”: Gisele Bündchen’s most controversial disguise happened during her years with Tom Brady,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/wearing-a-holy-thing-for-a-bad-purpose-gisele-bndchens-most-controversial-disguise-happened-during-her-years-with-tom-brady/articleshow/126682843.cms,"Gisele Bündchen faced intense scrutiny during her marriage to Tom Brady when a private decision about plastic surgery turned public. Seeking anonymity, she sparked backlash for how she concealed the procedure. Though she later regretted the surgery, Bündchen reclaimed control of her image, returned to high fashion, and proved her career could outlast controversy and personal upheaval.

Gisele Bündchen’s most misunderstood decision still follows her today

Fame usually rewards perfection, but for Gisele Bündchen, perfection came with a price. Long before she was defined by her marriage or divorce, Bündchen lived under constant scrutiny in an industry where every inch of the body is inspected. After motherhood changed her physically, the pressure did not soften. It intensified. What followed was a deeply personal decision that later became public in the most controversial way possible.Bündchen has never hidden her vulnerability about that period. She once admitted, “I was always praised for my body, and I felt like people had expectations from me that I couldn't deliver.” Nursing altered her body in ways she could not control, and public comments made it worse.“I felt very vulnerable because I can work out, I can eat healthy, but I can't change the fact that both of my kids enjoyed the left boob more than the right. All I wanted was for them to be even and for people to stop commenting on it.” The choice to undergo breast augmentation came from exhaustion, not vanity.In 2015, a routine trip to a Paris clinic became headline news. Reports claimed Bündchen wore a burqa to avoid paparazzi attention during her surgery visit.The backlash was swift and fierce. Critics accused her of using a sacred garment as a prop. One religious leader did not mince words. Imam Muhammad Abdullah Kamal Al-Azhari told Page Six, “She's not doing it for Islam. This is very bad ... She's wearing a holy thing for a bad purpose. ”Bündchen never publicly defended the disguise, but she later spoke openly about regretting the surgery itself. “When I woke up, I was like, 'What have I done?' I felt like I was living in a body I didn't recognize,” she said. “For the first year, I wore [baggy] clothes because I felt uncomfortable.”Time changed her relationship with that choice. After her divorce from Tom Brady, Bündchen returned to work without hesitation. She fronted a major campaign for Louis Vuitton and reentered elite fashion circles on her own terms.The episode remains controversial, but it also reveals something deeper. Even icons struggle with body image, regret, and reclaiming control in a world that never looks away.","Gisele Bündchen faced intense scrutiny when a private decision about plastic surgery turned public.

Mike Brown breaks silence after Knicks’ loss to Mavericks



Madison Square Garden has seen rough nights before, but Monday’s loss was devastating for fans.

""We've got to figure this out fast.""Knicks head coach Mike Brown also addressed the reaction from the stands and did not push back on it.“I’m okay with the boos,” Brown said. “If we’re playing crappy, boo. If I was in the stands, I would boo, too. You pay hard money to come to the game. This is a form of entertainment for the fans. They know good basketball, they know bad basketball, and we didn’t play good basketball in the first half.”Dallas dominated the home team with Max Christie’s game-high 26 points.

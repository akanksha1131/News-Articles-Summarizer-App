NEW DELHI: Holger Rune delivered one of the most jaw-dropping moments of Indian Wells 2025 on Tuesday, hitting a between-the-legs winner to save break point en route to a straight-sets victory over Stefanos Tsitsipas . But as thrilled as the crowd was, Rune was just as excited — at least until he saw the replay.""You know, I kind of had the expectation that I looked like Roger Federer when I hit it, and I didn't quite do that,"" Rune said with a laugh after his 6-4, 6-4 win. ""So that was disappointing.""The 21-year-old Dane’s flashy shot wasn’t just for show — it helped him knock off the world No. 9 and book a spot in the Indian Wells quarterfinals for the second consecutive year.It also marked Rune’s first quarterfinal appearance of 2025, a year that hasn’t quite lived up to expectations for the former world No. 4.After bursting onto the scene in 2022 with a memorable win over Novak Djokovic at the Paris Masters, Rune has struggled to maintain consistency, slipping to 13th in the rankings while contemporaries like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner continue to climb.Still, Rune is staying focused, emphasising growth over frustration.""It's about making results, but at the same time improving your game and having stability,"" he said. ""Because I don't believe I have become the worse player the last two years. I actually think the opposite. I think I have become a better all-around player.""He admits falling short of expectations can sting. ""You know, when you have these expectations and you don't quite, like, live up to them, of course it's disappointing,"" he said.""But it's very basic and maybe it's very boring to say it, but I just love tennis .""So even not being satisfied with my results, I still love to go down to the practice court and hit forehands, backhands, work on my shots, my physicality ...

'Not going anywhere': Rohit Sharma on retirement from ODIs after winning the Champions Trophy

Last one year has been a roller-coaster for you. Lots of things happened. Central contract, so much noise but you responded with one title at a time. IPL trophy, domestic success... how satisfying was it when you collected the Champions Trophy white blazer?

Did frustration ever creep in during this period?

Your KKR teammates have publicly appreciated your captaincy and the decisions during pressure situations. How much have you evolved as a captain after leading in the IPL, then Mumbai in the domestic competitions? You were in the leadership discussions for the Indian team too.

Your back troubled you for a long time and it wasn't something which was fixed after a quick rehab. It flared up when you played the longest format. What changes did you have to make in terms of routine, physical exercises and how confident are you with your body after undergoing what you did?

You spoke about not getting that recognition after the IPL title but India captain Rohit Sharma was very vocal in his praise for you. He termed you the ""silent hero"" of the Champions Trophy campaign. It wasn't typical Shreyas contributions because you are known for those big hands right from your early days but you mentioned during one of the chats after the final that even if the big runs didn't come you were happy to contribute in winning causes throughout the tournament.

It's a tough job to be the No. 4 in ODIs and be the link between the top and lower-order. There are some superstars in the team but you quietly come and do the job more often than not. How do you prepare for that difficult job?

How difficult were the tough times?

Did the Champions Trophy win feel sweeter because you played a very crucial role in winning the tournament for the side. Leading run-getter, getting them in difficult situations.

Do you feel there is unfinished business in the white jersey? Leadership ambitions?

The 2025 Champions Trophy winners medal around his neck and the iconic white blazer on, Shreyas Iyer broke into an impromptu jig when the rest of his teammates assembled for a group picture. Sukhbir's popular song 'Oh ho ho' was too hard to resist for the right-hander and he ensured not to miss a beat with his sublime footwork. It wasn't his usual Afrobeat number but on hearing ""mera waala gaana"" on the loudspeaker, the dancing skills took over and soon became a buzz on social media.The grooving continued in post-match interviews and the 30-year-old celebrated what was a very successful campaign where he ended as India's leading run-getter with 243 runs in five innings. These were hard-fought runs which came in tricky situations and allowed India to control the middle overs - the passage of play which was very crucial on the sluggish surfaces in Dubai. One knock at a time, not only did he remind of his class in the format but also put doubts, if there were still any, to rest.Over the past year, there were lows of missing a central contract and losing spot in the Test side but Shreyas took it on the chin and responded with an Indian Premier League (IPL) title for Kolkata Knight Riders and a very consistent run in the domestic circuit for Mumbai, across formats. Hours after the biggest high of his career, yet, India's No.4 opened up on the CT campaign, confidence he has in his game, unfinished business in whites and more.Edited excerpts:Extremely satisfying. To be honest it has been a journey and I have learnt a lot in this phase of my life where I got out of the contract after playing the 2023 ODI World Cup. I reassessed where I went wrong, what I should be doing, how well I need to focus on my fitness. I asked myself all these questions and prepared a routine and started focussing on my training and also the skills I added side by side. Once I got continuous matches in domestic cricket , I figured out how important fitness was for me especially when I raised my concerns at the start of the year. Overall I am extremely happy with myself... the way I came out of this, the way I handled the situation and most importantly I believed in myself.Frustration toh nahi tha because I was playing IPL. The major focus was to win the IPL and thankfully I won it. I personally felt I didn't get the recognition I wanted to after winning the IPL but at the end of the day, as long as you have self integrity and you keep doing the right things when no one is watching, that is more important and that is what I kept doing.I would say I am more of an instinctive person. I see the situation, read the situation and based on that I call my shots. I believe a lot on my gut calls. Whatever the first thought comes in my mind, I take that and back it. Most important is you back your teammates, you back your calls and every individual who is part of the team on the given day. It's important you back them in pressure situations and make sure that you believe in their abilities. Once all these patterns are set up for you, everything else follows.I am extremely happy with my training routine. There is this guy Sagar who has been working with me on my training and he creates schedules for me based on my activities on the field. He helped me a lot in terms of changing my body, the training and understanding what I was going through. He worked with me during the IPL as well. Lot of credit goes to him also. From there on I was convinced to follow whatever he says in terms of my fitness and it worked well.When I talk about recognition, it's about getting that respect. It was about the respect for whatever efforts I put on the field. I think sometimes it gets unnoticed but extremely satisfied with the efforts I put in because they weren't easy wickets to bat on. It wasn't easy to take singles especially when the bowlers were bowling so tight. I just had the belief in myself that once I get two sixes here or there, I can change the momentum towards our side. Luckily I got them at crucial times.I don't come quietly (laughs). I come with my full heart and there is something else going on in my mind. I have a lot of confidence in myself to do the job. Koi bhi situation mai bhejo, karke aauga. This mindset works for me and this confidence comes after facing rejections and failures. They are the best teachers. You also get to know during tough times, only you can lift yourself. No one else.Whenever I am in that low phase of life, very few people message me. And they are Pravin Amre sir, Abhishek Nayar, Sagar and there are few other people who supported me a lot during that time and I will always keep them with me. They are normal when everything is fine but even nicer when I am undergoing that low period. I appreciate that kind of mentality and you will definitely grow if you have such people around you.Nothing is sweeter than winning the trophy. Your individual score and all is secondary and important is that the team wins. People are happy in India. So many people support us from the ground and everywhere and winning the game for them feels very good.Obviously there is... I want to play as much as I can. I have done well in the domestic tournaments but let's see what happens. I don't want to think too much about it because the more I think, more mind will be taxed. It will basically get tired. I live in the moment, maze karta hu [I enjoy] and think about the match when it comes. I don't think too much about [the] future or past. It has helped me a lot.","Shreyas Iyer was India's leading run-getter with 243 runs in five innings.

As the curtains came down on the ICC Champions Trophy , a stage that witnessed several breathtaking performances over the last three weeks, some players ensured the spotlight shines a little brighter on them. From blistering centuries to match-winning spells, the tournament was a showcase of skill, temperament and most importantly, T20-ready performances.With the IPL 2025 season on the horizon, scouts and franchise owners would undoubtedly have taken note of these standout players, whose stellar campaigns could translate into lucrative contracts in the world’s biggest T20 league.All these cricketers, incidentally, participated in the auctions and went unsold, so they could become attractive buys in case franchises shop for replacements.Duckett’s stellar performance in the ICC Champions Trophy has significantly bolstered his prospects for inclusion in the 2025 IPL. In a group-stage match against Australia, Duckett went into overdrive, scoring 165 runs off 143 balls with 17 fours and three sixes embellishing the innings. Despite going unsold in the initial IPL-2025 auction, Duckett’s recent form has caught the attention of several franchises seeking to strengthen their squads. Reports suggest that Royal Challengers Bangalore are considering him as a potential replacement playerIn the opening game against Pakistan, Latham hit an unbeaten 118 off 104 balls, including 10 fours and 3 sixes. Throughout the tournament, Latham consistently contributed to New Zealand’s cause. His proficiency against both pace and spin, coupled with his wicketkeeping abilities, make him a valuable asset in the T20 format also. Latham’s recent form could open opportunities for him to secure an IPL contract.Henry emerged as the leading wicket-taker of the tournament, securing 10 wickets in four matches at an impressive average of 16.70 and an economy rate of 5.32. Henry’s consistent wicket-taking ability and control over run flow were standout features. His proficiency in both the Powerplay and death overs makes him a valuable asset in the T20 format. He has previously played for Lucknow Super Giants, Chennai Super Kings and Kings XI Punjab in the IPL. And given his current form and experience, Henry is poised to be a soughtafter player if any franchise wishes to make an addition to its squad or bring in a replacement player. It all depends, though, on the shoulder injury that didn’t allow him to play in the CT final.In a pivotal group-stage match against England, Zadran delivered a record-breaking innings, scoring 177 off 146 balls – the highest individual score in Champions Trophy history. His innings was marked by 12 boundaries and six sixes, highlighting his ability to smash those big ones. Despite his impressive credentials, Zadran went unsold in the initial IPL-2025 auction, where his base price was set at Rs 75 lakh. However, his recent exploits have reignited interest among IPL franchises.A lower-order hard-hitting batsman and a highly effective off-spinner, Bracewell was impressive with both bat and ball in the Champions Trophy. In the match against Bangladesh, he delivered his best ODI bowling figures, 4/26. In the final against India, Bracewell played a crucial knock. His quickfire 53 off 40 balls ensured the Black Caps reached a competitive total. During India’s chase, Bracewell delivered a stingy spell, picking the prized scalp of Virat Kohli as well as Axar Patel and finishing with figures of 2/28 in his 10 overs. He has previously played for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 2023 season.The tall Australian delivered notable performances in the Champions Trophy. Over three matches, he secured seven wickets at of 21.71 and an economy rate of 5.84. His standout performance came against Afghanistan, where he achieved figures of 3/47. Dwarshuis’s left-arm seam bowling offers variety, and his experience in high-pressure situations makes him an attractive proposition for the IPL franchises. He has previously been a part of Delhi Capitals and Kings XI Punjab in the IPL. Dwarshuis is also a sought-after player in various T20 leagues of the world","The ICC Champions Trophy was a showcase of skill, temperament and most importantly, T20-ready performances.

'Not going anywhere': Rohit Sharma on retirement from ODIs after winning the Champions Trophy

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma gave a special mention to the ""silent hero"" Shreyas Iyer after India scripted another triumphant chapter in its rich cricketing history.India clinched the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 title with a four-wicket victory over New Zealand in the final on Sunday. This marked India's third Champions Trophy triumph, having previously won in 2002 (as joint winners with Sri Lanka) and in 2013.All through the tournament, India's middle order has been the team's quiet protector, stepping up in critical moments—either stabilising the innings after top-order setbacks or forging crucial partnerships to steer the team to safety.""I am very proud of this team. We knew the conditions would be difficult, but we adapted well. If you look at all the games, the first game was against Bangladesh. I know it was only 230, but we knew that the wicket was a little slow. We needed partnerships. The batsmen made big partnerships. Not to forget the silent hero Shreyas Iyer throughout the tournament was brilliant He was very, very important in that middle phase for us. Stitched the partnerships with all the batters who are batting with him that semi-final against Australia with him with him and Virat at that point was very, very important,"" Rohit said in the post match conference.Iyer concluded the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy as the tournament's second-highest run-scorer, following a crucial 48-run knock in the final against New Zealand. With 241 runs in five matches, he emerged as India's leading run-getter and finished just behind Rachin Ravindra, who amassed 263 runs.Though Iyer narrowly missed a well-deserved half-century, he played a pivotal role in India's chase of 252, forging a crucial 61-run fourth-wicket stand with Axar Patel.Displaying composure under pressure, Iyer built a steady and vital partnership with Axar, ensuring India remained on track for their third Champions Trophy title.""And even against Pakistan and New Zealand, the league game that we played. And even today, to be honest, When I got out, we had lost three wickets. And at that time, again, we needed a partnership of 50 to 70 runs, which him and Shreyas have done. So, when such performances happen, when you understand the conditions and adapt the conditions as soon as possible, it feels good. So that's why my work is less than it should be,"" he said.ALSO SEE: Exclusive: Gautam Gambhir to travel with India 'A' to England ""I don't need to speak much because the boys understand what to do in between. And not to forget, We are talking about batting, but keeping the bowlers, the teams, under 240s under 250 is a big effort. We make it in our minds that the wicket is helping the spinners. But you must have seen that in the fifth match, no ball has turned in such a way that the ball is turning every time, in every over,"" he said.""Sometimes, one or two balls turn in between, but that is the challenge that you are facing as a batter. You don't have to be ready for the ball that is turning. The straight ball that is coming, which is 80% out of 100, or 70%, you have to be ready for that. So, I think that is the adaption. And that is what these guys have shown in the middle, that this is how we want to adapt and play our game,"" the Indian skipper said.","India won the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 with a four-wicket victory over New Zealand in the final on Sunday.

'Not going anywhere': Rohit Sharma on retirement from ODIs after winning the Champions Trophy

The absence of a representative from the host nation's cricket federation, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), at the presentation ceremony after the Champions Trophy final in Dubai on March 9 hasn't gone down well with the PCB , following which the board has lodged an official complaint with the International Cricket Council ( ICC ), according to a report in Pakistan daily 'Dawn'.PCB's Chief Operating Officer, Sumair Ahmed Syed, attended the final between India and New Zealand but wasn't invited to the dais as part of the dignitaries presenting the awards. Syed is also the director of the tournament.The Dawn reports that the PCB has officially complained about it.“A formal complaint has been lodged with the ICC, demanding an explanation and a public apology,” the board’s spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report. “We are appalled by this blatant disregard for Pakistan’s role as the host nation.“The ICC’s decision to exclude Mr Syed — who was both the Tournament Director and the PCB Chair’s designated representative — violates its own standard operating procedure. This is a matter of principle, fairness, and respect for the game’s global stakeholders.”PCB chairman, Mohsin Naqvi, was officially invited for the ceremony but couldn't travel to Dubai as he was unwell.ICC, meanwhile, has clarified why Syed wasn't asked to join the rest of the dignitaries on stage.""The ICC only invites the head of the host board such as the president, vice-president, chairman, or CEO to participate in the awards ceremony. Other board officials, even if present at the venue, are not part of the stage proceedings,"" said the ICC spokesperson.But the PCB argues the incident as ""repeated blunders"".“The ICC’s repeated blunders, double standards and selective governance have cast serious doubts over its credibility,” the PCB spokesperson was quoted further. “By sidelining the host nation at its own tournament, the governing body has once again shown a troubling lack of neutrality and fairness.“We have demanded a full public clarification and an assurance that such biased and unjust treatment will not happen again. The PCB expects professionalism, transparency, and equal representation from cricket’s governing body.“The PCB has made its stance clear: This is not just about a presentation ceremony — it is about respect, integrity, and the fundamental principles of fair governance in international cricket. The world is watching. Will the ICC finally uphold professionalism, or will it continue to cater to selective interests at the cost of cricket’s global integrity?”","PCB's Chief Operating Officer, Sumair Ahmed Syed, attended the final between India and New Zealand but wasn't invited to the dais as part of the dignitaries presenting the awards.

Varun Chakaravarthy after dream Champions Trophy debut: 'Virat, Rohit, Hardik helped calm me down'

Former India cricketer R Ashwin believes Varun Chakravarthy was crucial to India's Champions Trophy victory. Chakravarthy joined the squad after impressing in matches against England, that preceded the eight-team tournament, despite not being in the initial team selection.Though Rachin Ravindra from New Zealand received the Player of the Tournament award, Ashwin had a different perspective on who deserved the honour.""Whatever said and done, the Player of the Tournament, in my view, was Varun Chakaravarthy. He didn't play the entire tournament. He was such a big difference. If Varun Chakaravarthy wasn't there, I think this game would have been very different. He brought that X-factor and the novelty factor. If I were the judge, I would have given it to Varun. He was the biggest difference,"" Ashwin expressed on his Hindi YouTube channel 'Ash Ki Baat'.Ashwin particularly praised Chakravarthy's bowling technique against Glenn Phillips.""Just look at how he dismissed Glenn Phillips. He wasn't covering the stumps, so Varun went wide of the crease and bowled that googly. In my view, Varun has to be the Player of the Series. The award should be given to someone who made the biggest difference. Varun Chakaravarthy deserves the Player of the Series award,"" he added.Ashwin acknowledged the bowling unit's contribution to India's victory, specifically in limiting New Zealand to 251/7 in the final match.""I am so happy for Rohit and Gautam Gambhir. Just spare a thought for GG [Gambhir]. What must he be going through? Losing Test series against New Zealand, you have been losing a few. But you made a remarkable decision. There was no Jasprit Bumrah. Remarkably, this Indian team won the Champions Trophy without [Jasprit] Bumrah. What does it tell you? Where does it leave Indian cricket? I am so happy. I think the world will take some time to catch up with Indian cricket ,"" he stated.Chakravarthy, who finished as the tournament's second-highest wicket-taker, shared his thoughts after the final match.""I didn't expect to turn out like this, a dream come true. The spin was less in the first innings, and I had to be disciplined, just stick to the basics,"" Chakravarthy told the broadcasters after the win.",Former India cricketer R Ashwin believes Varun Chakravarthy was crucial to India's Champions Trophy victory.

'Not going anywhere': Rohit Sharma on retirement from ODIs after winning the Champions Trophy

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

NEW DELHI: Indian wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant , who recently won the ICC Champions Trophy with India, has credited his late coach Tarak Singh for shaping his game. Pant, set to play for Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025, fondly recalled Singh's influence on his cricketing journey.The most expensive player in IPL history at Rs 27 crores, Pant will lead LSG as they kick off their campaign against Delhi Capitals (DC) in Visakhapatnam on March 24.Speaking on JioHotstar, Pant reflected on Singh's role in improving his defence and how his father encouraged him to compete against senior players.""When I started playing after moving from Roorkee, I mostly played lofted shots--almost 80 per cent of the time. I did not think about playing along the ground because I used to open the innings. My father always said that playing against your age group is normal, but if you want to improve in cricket, you must compete with older players. So, from a young age, he pushed me to participate in senior tournaments. Even when I was 10 or 11, I played in open tournaments,"" recalled Pant.""When I joined Tarak Sir, he used to get really angry. He had one rule--'You must learn defence first. If you master defence, you will master everything else.' He believed I already knew how to hit big shots, so he wanted me to learn how to defend. I used to keep an eye on him while batting. If he was watching, I would play proper defence, playing drives and textbook shots. But the moment I saw him looking away, I would go back to playing my natural attacking game,"" he added.Pant explained that his attacking instincts were influenced by watching unconventional shots played by senior cricketers, particularly MS Dhoni ""Earlier, quite a few players played these shots. I have seen old videos of Mahi bhai (MS Dhoni), and he, too, has played the lap shot. But percentage-wise, I think they used to do it less. The game is changing now--field placements are different, and players are adapting. Some might feel it is necessary for their game, while others may not. At the end of the day, how you read the game determines how you play it,"" he added.Pant also credited gymnastics for improving his fitness.""I used to do gymnastics as a kid. My gymnastics coach always told me that it would come in handy in life. Basu Sir, our Indian team trainer, once told me in 2018-19, 'Thank you to your gymnastics coach because what he taught you in childhood is still benefiting you today.' I kept practicing handsprings, and it has played a huge role in my fitness for sure,"" he added.The wicketkeeper-batter also addressed how his bat frequently slips out of his hands, a sight that has amused many on the field.""I think it (bat slipping out of his hands) mostly happens because I hold my bottom hand very lightly. I mainly try to use my bottom hand for support because, at times, it starts dominating. So, I focus on gripping my top hand tightly. But when I overreach--especially when the ball is too wide or too short--it is not always in the ideal hitting zone,"" he said.""Sometimes, the shot I attempt may only have a 30-40 per cent success rate, but depending on the match situation, I am willing to take that risk. That is my mindset. When I take that chance and overreach, I need to do something to maintain balance. At times, it may look like I am throwing the bat, but in reality, I am just trying to make the most of that delivery. If my bat slips, if it is not in my hand, or even if it hits my head--my only focus at that moment is finding the boundary. That is my thought process,"" he added.Pant emphasised that while IPL is a great platform, his ultimate dream has always been to represent India.""I believe that if your goal is to play for your country, everything else--including the IPL--will eventually fall into place. If you have that bigger mindset, success will follow. I always believed that I would play for India one day, and God has been kind. At 18, I got the opportunity to make my debut, and I am grateful for that,"" he concluded.Pant has played his entire IPL career with Delhi Capitals (DC) since 2016, scoring 3,284 runs in 110 matches at an average of 35.31, including a century and 18 fifties. He was appointed captain in 2021 and led the team to the playoffs that season.","Indian wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant has credited his late coach Tarak Singh for shaping his game. Pant is set to play for Lucknow Super Giants in the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025. The most expensive player in IPL history at Rs 27 crores, Pant will lead LSG as they kick off their campaign against Delhi Capitals (DC) on March 24.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118881534,imgsize-60720,width-400,resizemode-4/118881534.jpg"

Seven medical professionals faced trial on Tuesday for homicide charges related to their treatment of Argentine football icon Diego Maradona before his death.Maradona passed away on November 25, 2020, at age 60, whilst recovering from brain surgery at home. He had struggled with cocaine and alcohol dependencies for decades.The accused face potential prison sentences of eight to 25 years if found guilty of ""homicide with possible intent"", for allegedly continuing treatment despite knowing it could result in the footballer's death.Supporters gathered outside the courthouse on Tuesday, displaying banners demanding justice and singing tributes to their fallen hero.Veronica Ojeda, mother of Maradona's young son Dieguito, tearfully thanked the assembled crowd. His daughters, Dalma and Gianinna, entered silently.The prosecution presented their opening statement, promising substantial evidence that the medical team failed in their duties during Maradona's final days.Prosecutor Patricio Ferrari displayed a photograph of Maradona post-mortem, showing him supine with a distended abdomen.Maradona was discovered lifeless two weeks after surgery in a leased residence in an upscale Buenos Aires area, where he stayed after hospital discharge.Medical examination revealed death from cardiac failure and acute pulmonary oedema. His passing during the Covid-19 pandemic caused nationwide grief in Argentina.Thousands queued to pay respects as his body lay in state. The trial, featuring nearly 120 witnesses, is expected to continue until July.The defendants include various medical professionals. A separate jury trial awaits the day nurse who discovered Maradona's body.Prosecutors assert that recommending home care was negligent and inadequate, leaving Maradona in prolonged distress before death.A 2021 expert panel concluded proper medical facility care might have improved survival chances. The residence lacked basic emergency equipment like a defibrillator.Family representatives cite communications suggesting staff prioritised financial gain over proper care. The accused maintain their innocence.In Buenos Aires' La Paternal district, where ""El Pibe de Oro"" first displayed his talents, street art demands justice.

NEW DELHI: The incident in southwestern Congo, where a boat capsized resulting in the loss of 25 lives, primarily football players, highlights the prevalent issue of maritime safety in the region.The players were returning from a match in Mushie city, Maï-Ndombe province, when the vessel overturned on the Kwa River on Sunday night. Alexis Mputu, the provincial spokesman, suggested that poor visibility at night may have contributed to the accident.While at least 30 individuals survived the incident, as confirmed by Renacle Kwatiba, the local administrator of Mushie territory, such tragic occurrences are not uncommon in the central African country.Overcrowded vessels and late-night travels are frequently cited as contributing factors, exacerbated by the lack of enforcement of maritime regulations by the authorities.Congo's vast network of rivers serves as a crucial means of transportation for its over 100 million inhabitants, particularly in remote areas where infrastructure is inadequate or non-existent.Regrettably, hundreds of lives have been lost in boat accidents in recent years, as more people resort to wooden vessels packed with passengers and goods, abandoning the few available roads.The incident underscores the pressing need for improved maritime safety measures, including stricter enforcement of regulations, better vessel maintenance, and awareness campaigns to promote responsible travel practices.Addressing these issues is crucial to prevent further loss of life and ensure the safe transportation of people and goods across Congo's waterways.","The players were returning from a match in Mushie city, Maï-Ndombe province, when the vessel overturned on the Kwa River.

KOLKATA: It's a paradox which seems to have come wrapped in desperation and which Indian football under Manolo Marquez couldn't simply sidestep.Marquez's decision to coax 40-year-old Sunil Chhetri out of retirement may have raised a storm, but India's Spanish coach emphasized that if current form is a criterion for selection, the veteran striker is an automatic choice. ""At this moment, he's the best striker… he's the best Indian striker and I think there is no doubt about this,"" Marquez said after FC Goa 's loss to Indian Super League Shield winners Mohun Bagan SG at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.""We need players (for the national team) who play with regularity in a single league. And yes, Sunil is one such player,"" the Spaniard added.In an unprecedented move, the All India Football Federation appointed Marquez to the hot seat last year, allowing him to manage FC Goa concurrently during the 2024-25 season before assuming the senior national team's coaching role on a full-time basis.However, the 56-year-old Spaniard insisted that his move to include Chhetri in the Blue Tigers squad for Asian Cup 2027 final round qualifier against Bangladesh - to be held in Shillong on March 25 - is intrinsically aimed at serving the national team's interest on an emergency basis and not putting up a barrier for the development of youngsters.Having failed to qualify for the Asian Cup directly, Marquez's India need to seal their place in the continental showpiece tournament via qualifiers. The Blue Tigers have been clubbed with Bangladesh, Hong Kong and Singapore in Group C of the final-round qualifiers with only the group topper being eligible to earn a ticket to the Asian Cup finals. ""At Hyderabad FC and now at FC Goa, (my job) is about development (of Indian players), but in this tournament (Asian Cup), you need to win and this is not the moment for developing players. It's not about… let's see if this guy who plays for this team in the league can score or not.""This is about the national team. You need a level, you need to play well as soon as possible. The most important part is the teams (in the group) who are coming at the top level. Obviously, we want to win and we need immediate results,"" Marquez told reporters. He revealed that calling Chhetri and making him available for national duty again was ""a difficult situation"" for him.""You can see who the Indian top scorer in ISL is - Sunil Chhetri. Who is the second top scorer among Indians? Brison Fernandes, and the third top scorer is Subhashis Bose. We need someone to score goals. I know Sunil has retired. This is the reason I spoke with him personally. It's a difficult situation for him. It's a difficult situation for me.

and records galore

KOLKATA: It was an evening Mohun Bagan Super Giant made their own with a sense of inevitability. A record run at home, record points tally and winning the biggest prize in Indian club football in back-to-back seasons - Jose Molina 's brigade brought quite something to the party on Saturday.They celebrated their Indian Super League Shield-winning show in grand style, defeating second-placed FC Goa 2-0 at the Salt Lake Stadium here and finishing their group stage with a slice of revenge against the visitors.FC Goa - supervised by India head coach Manuel Manolo - came into the match as the only other team after Bengaluru FC to have been able to conquer Molina's brigade this season. But they lost the plot in the reverse fixture, conceding two goals born out of individual blunders.On the first occasion, Boris Singh much to everyone's horror saw his back-pass with a header off an ambitious but misdirected long ball from Bagan defender Tom Aldred roll into an empty net with the Goa goalkeeper Hrithik Tiwari also leaving his place with the intention of claiming it in the 63rd minute.As if that dreadful defensive miscommunication was not enough, Bagan became the beneficiary of another clanger deep into the stoppage time. This time, India's defensive mainstay Sandesh Jhingan messed up big time in controlling the ball under pressure from Jason Cummings and Greg Stewart pounced on it to beat the goalkeeper with consummate ease.Mohun Bagan finished the league stage with the highest number of points (56), record number of wins in a ISL season (17) and an unbeaten run at home (11 wins and one draw). Goa's late chase for the Shield fell eight-point short.Long before the kick-off, thousands of Bagan fans made it an occasion to remember. They unfurled tifos highlighting the team's legacy and supremacy; they carried out Mexican waves and turned on the flashlight on their mobile phones to set light to the team's ambitions.Despite having clinched the Shield with two games to spare, Molina opted for a strong side giving only goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh his first game. It's, however, Goa who scored in all their matches in the group stage before Saturday and came close to scoring early on, Iker Guarrotxena missing the target by a whisker while Udanta Singh seeing his goal-bound attempt blocked by Aldred.However, the highlight of the first half came in the injury time when Manvir Singh did find the back of the net but Goa vehemently protested and referee Rahul Kumar Gupta eventually disallowed it after consultation with fourth official Harish Kundu, judging that Dimitri Petratos had touched the ball with his hand in the build-up of the move.Goa got a reprieve. But then came two individual mistakes, leading to their downfall in an uncharacteristic way.Bagan were already into the party mood. They brought the house down with another win; they rang the curtain down on the league stage by breaking new ground.",Mohun Bagan beat FC Goa 2-0 to win Indian Super League Shield.

Inter Milan extended their lead over Napoli at top of Serie A to four points after they were made to work hard at home by Monza before winning 3-2 on Saturday.Despite being heavily favoured against last-placed Monza with only 14 points this season, Inte found themselves trailing by two goals in the opening half.Marko Arnautovic scored just before half-time to narrow the gap, and while Inter dominated possession afterwards, they didn't level the score until the 64th minute, when Hakan Calhanoglu made it even.The winning goal came in the 77th minute when Lautaro Martinez's header took a slight deflection off Monza's Greek defender Giorgos Kyriakopoulos before finding the net.Despite their struggles, Inter's victory increased pressure on Napoli, who have managed just one point from their previous five matches ahead of their clash with seventh-ranked Fiorentina.Meanwhile, AC Milan faced a challenging away match against struggling Lecce, mirroring a similar situation to their city rivals. American forward Christian Pulisic netted twice, helping his team secure a vital 3-2 victory and avoid a fourth consecutive Serie A loss.Without their suspended French keeper Mike Maignan, Sergio Conceicao's team found themselves trailing 2-0, as Lecce's Montenegrin striker Nikola Krstovic scored twice.The tide turned when Antonino Gallo's own goal in the 68th minute gave Milan hope, followed by Pulisic converting a penalty five minutes afterwards.","Inter Milan extended their lead over Napoli to four points with a 3-2 win over Monza.

Indian Wells: Defending champion Iga Swiatek edged closer to an unprecedented third straight Indian Wells WTA title Sunday, overwhelming Dayana Yastremska 6-0, 6-2 to reach the fourth round.Swiatek's 65-minute victory set the tone on a day that saw Daniil Medvedev spend just 10 minutes on court before ailing opponent Alex Michelsen retired.Swiatek, the world number two from Poland, was in full control against hard-hitting Ukrainian Yastremska, swinging freely as she won the first 10 games.She converted six of her 11 break chances and didn't face a break point herself and it was virtually over by the time Yastremska got on the board with wins in her last two service games.""It's always hard to finish a match like that,"" Swiatek said. ""But I'm happy that I got my intensity up the last game and closed it with confidence.""Swiatek next faces Czech Karolina Muchova , who trailed 3-5 in the first set but won 10 of the next 11 games to beat compatriot Katerina Siniakova 7-5, 6-1.Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva and 2023 Indian Wells champion Elena Rybakina joined Swiatek in dishing out bagels as they lined up a fourth-round clash.Andreeva, who triumphed in Dubai last month to become the youngest ever winner of a WTA 1000 event , beat Denmark's Clara Tauson 6-3, 6-0 in 63 minutes.Rybakina downed Britain's Katie Boulter 6-0, 7-5.Andreeva -- who beat Tauson in the final in Dubai -- said she found conditions on Stadium Court tougher than she made it look.""I'm just happy the way I managed to stay in the game,"" she said. ""I didn't give her much rhythm so I guess it was not bad -- but there's a lot of things to work on.""Women's fourth seed Jessica Pegula of the United States, fresh off her first WTA title of the year in Austin, was another quick winner, putting away China's Wang Xinyu 6-2, 6-1 in just 62 minutes.Pegula next faces Ukraine's Elina Svitolina, a 6-2, 6-4 winner over Danielle Collins.Medvedev headlined the men's lineup in the combined ATP Masters and WTA 1000 event, but he was barely underway when 20-year-old Michelson retired because of illness after dropping the first two games.""Food poisoning or something like this, these things happen,"" said Medvedev, who was headed to the practice courts to tune up for a fourth-round clash with 10th-seeded American Tommy Paul.Paul beat Britain's 2021 Indian Wells winner Cameron Norrie, now ranked 77th in the world, 6-3, 7-5.Eighth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas, coming off his first title in almost a year in Dubai, beat Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 6-3 in a rematch of their Dubai quarter-final last week.Tsitsipas dropped just eight points on his serve as he wrong-footed Italian with a variety of athletic shots, breaking him three times on the way to victory in 68 minutes.After months in the doldrums Tsitsipas said he was relishing a new mental approach to the game.""I just feel like I want to get out there on the court and be a gladiator, and that's how I approach every single match I get to play,"" he said.Tallon Griekspoor , the world No. 43 from the Netherlands who shocked world number two and top seed Alexander Zverev in the second round, backed up his big win with a 7-6 (7/3), 6-3 victory over France's 29th seed Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.Griekspoor fired 10 aces, dominating the first set tiebreaker, and didn't face a break point in the second set.Griekspoor needed an hour and 16 minutes to secure the win, but in a season in which dropping the first set has become an alarming habit that was fast enough.""It feels nice to win a match in under one and a half hour,"" he said.","Defending champion Iga Swiatek beats Dayana Yastremska 6-0, 6-2 to reach fourth round. Daniil Medvedev wins just 10 minutes on court before ailing opponent Alex Michelsen retires. Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva and 2023 Indian Wells champion Elena Rybakina win.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118830200,imgsize-27086,width-400,resizemode-4/118830200.jpg"

Former world number one Novak Djokovic , who has won the Indian Wells ATP Masters five times, suffered a surprising defeat in his opening match on Saturday, going down to lucky loser Botic van de Zandschulp, while reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz progressed to the next round.The 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic lost 6-2, 3-6, 6-1.""No excuses for a poor performance,"" the Serb said after the match. ""It doesn't feel great when you play this way on the court. But congratulations to my opponent -- just a bad day in the office, I guess, for me.""Van de Zandschulp has established a notable record against the big guns.His impressive victories include a remarkable win against Alcaraz at the US Open in the previous year, followed by a triumph over Rafael Nadal in Davis Cup, which turned out to be the Spanish legend's final professional match.""I think I kept my cool during the whole match,” said van de Zandschulp. ""I know if I go into the match and lose my cool, especially against the big players, it's going to be a really tough day. That's always one thing I'm trying to do well.""Djokovic reduced his unforced errors significantly in the second set, compared to his 14 mistakes in the first set and swiftly secured a service break, establishing a 3-0 advantage.He celebrated with a fist pump after striking a powerful forehand winner to the corner, earning his first break opportunity of the contest.Despite the intense exchanges continuing throughout, Djokovic's visible signs of frustration emerged occasionally. Although he lost his serve while attempting to close out the set, he succeeded in his subsequent service game, delivering a powerful forehand winner to the baseline to make it an even contest.But the momentum shift proved temporary. Zandschulp maintained consistent pressure through both baseline play and net approaches, as Djokovic's error count increased steadily.Zandschulp gained the upper hand with a break for 3-1, subsequently winning five consecutive games as Djokovic struggled to halt his opponent's progress.Djokovic exit followed a similar shock suffered by world number two Alexander Zverev and fourth-seeded Casper Ruud.The tournament's landscape has shifted dramatically, with world number three Alcaraz emerging as the highest-ranked player remaining, particularly notable given world number one Jannik Sinner's absence due to a three-month drugs suspension.Alcaraz, pursuing a remarkable achievement of three consecutive Indian Wells titles - a feat only accomplished by Djokovic and Roger Federer - commenced his title defence impressively, defeating France's Quentin Halys 6-4, 6-2.The Spanish player secured an early advantage to claim the opening set, before establishing a commanding 4-0 lead in the second set with impressive serving.His dominant display included seven aces and successful defence of the sole break point faced, concluding the match efficiently in 67 minutes.""I was nervous at the beginning of the match,"" he told a supportive crowd. ""The first match is never easy so I was trying to be focused on my game.""I just tried to be relaxed, as relaxed as I can. Can always be better, but I'm ready for the (next) round and excited.""Australian Open winner Madison Keys began proceedings at the combined ATP Masters and WTA 1000 tournament, defeating Russia's Anastasia Potapova 6-3, 6-0 in her first appearance since claiming her first Grand Slam title.Her performance was sharp as she overcame Potapova in 63 minutes.In other early contests, American players Taylor Fritz and Coco Gauff progressed to the next round.Fritz, who won the men's title in 2022, beat Italian qualifier Matteo Gigante 7-5, 6-3, while Gauff -- also seeded third in her section -- secured a hard-fought 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7/4) win against Japan's Moyuka Uchijima.","Former world number one Novak Djokovic suffers shock defeat at Indian Wells.

Not as much for his frame, but rather how he employs it, serving at lightning speed.The foundation of the Frenchman's serve is a smooth, rapid-fire action, where he pushes off the ground and crushes down the orb. The world No.30, who clinches 89 percent of his service games, has saved 70 percent of breakpoints and averages 18 aces per match, is looking to put the blush on the receiver.Agreed that the serve is but one shot in matchups that are likely to test different tools, but Mpetshi Perricard's serve makes for a compelling case.""You need to accept that you can miss,'' he says. ""I'm aggressive, I'm near the limit. But you have to prepare yourself, be ready that you may miss a lot of times.""""And you can succeed a lot of times too.""As much as his serves appear to manifest everything that is out of control -- a hailstorm, a howling tempest - control is a big part of his motion.

The other one says, you have a big chance to win the point if you go near the limit. I would choose the one with more chance to win the point.

""Players will adjust. You guess, use reflexes, or pick a side and say, you're not going to ace me on the T.""Daniil Medvedev , the world No.6, employs a tactic against every big server he plays.""They all serve so well, just by statistics they're not going to lose their serve that much during the year. You need to be really solid on your serve, try to take it to the tiebreak, maybe then try to put pressure on their serves,"" he said.The Frenchman - whose father Guylain Mpetshi is a former footballer and mother Sylvie Perricard, a homemaker - however, didn't work on his serve in the pre-season this time. ""I have a lot to improve,"" he said about his game. ""I have to be better with my movement, my backhand... When my serve doesn't make the point, I have to be very good when I play backhand or forehand.""Mpetshi Perricard started out playing a two-handed backhand, but switched to the single-hander at nine years of age. ""I felt more confident with the one-handed backhand,"" he said.Tennis has been the way forward for Mpetshi Perricard and his younger sister Daphnee, who is on the junior Tour. In his player bio on the ATP website, he lists his mother as his hero. Mpetshi Perricard's face delights in breaking into smiles off the court, but when he talks of Sylvie the smile lines fade and an intensity sets in.""She helped in a different way than my father,"" he says.Sylvie told her son words he needed to hear.

World No. 2 Alexander Zverev , who suffered a defeat against Tallon Griekspoor in his Indian Wells opener, admitted that his ""terrible"" performance has pushed any thoughts of overtaking Jannik Sinner in the rankings out of his mind.Zverev entered the prestigious ATP Masters event in the California desert as the top seed, taking advantage of world No. 1 Sinner’s belated three-month suspension for a doping violation.Having finished as the runner-up to Sinner at the Australian Open, Zverev initially saw an opportunity to claim the top spot. However, with his current struggles on the court, that ambition is quickly fading.""Now it's less, because I'm just playing terrible,"" said Zverev, who made early exits at Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and Acapulco before his disastrous Indian Wells showing.He became the first men's top seed at Indian Wells to crash out in the opening round since Andy Murray in 2017.""I have to find my game before thinking about that, because to become world number one you have to win tournaments,"" Zverev said.""I'm not past getting first, second round at the moment. So I need to figure that out first.""Zverev admitted he had no clear explanation for his dip in form since the Australian Open.Before the tournament, he had cited illness during two of the three weeks of his ""rough South American swing"" as a possible factor.However, after his 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/4) loss to 43rd-ranked Griekspoor—who had been defeated in six of their previous seven meetings—Zverev conceded that he was simply not playing well enough.""I'm not playing a level that I want to play, definitely not playing anywhere near what I played in Australia,"" he said.After taking the first set against Griekspoor, Zverev staged a comeback from 2-5 down in the second to lead 6-5, only to be broken while serving for the match.In the third set, he saved five match points in the 12th game and converted his fifth break point to push the contest into a decisive tiebreak. However, he could not hold off Griekspoor any longer, ultimately falling short.""He played a good match,"" Zverev said. ""There's no question about that. But I have to look at myself a little bit.""""It's everything,"" he said. ""I keep working, but right now it's not clicking.""",World No. 2 Alexander Zverev loses to Tallon Griekspoor in the first round of the Indian Wells Masters.

Brazilian rising star Joao Fonseca demonstrated resilience by overcoming a third-set deficit to defeat British player Jacob Fearnley 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 on Thursday at Indian Wells .The teenager, who earned his place in history as the 10th-youngest ATP Tour winner with his victory at the Argentina Open in February, said: ""Today was petty difficult, a lot of windy, but I got through. Beginning of the match I played really well and he was making some mistakes. But the second set he played more aggressive and I was a bit more tight, maybe a bit more nervous.""Fearnley seemed to gain the upper hand after breaking Fonseca's serve in the third set's third game, and subsequently held his serve for a 3-1 lead in a lengthy game that reached deuce on five occasions.However, Fonseca responded by claiming the following five games in succession, securing two service breaks and finishing the competitive match between the world's 80th and 81st-ranked competitors with a decisive backhand volley winner.In the women's opening round, Olympic champion Belinda Bencic from Switzerland secured a straightforward victory against Germany's Tatjana Maria, winning 6-1, 6-1 in a swift 65-minute match.The Abu Dhabi champion from February 2024, Bencic, who welcomed her daughter Bella in April 2023, has made an impressive return to competitive tennis following her maternity break.The 27-year-old Swiss player, who has exceeded expectations in her return to the sport, acknowledged that managing the playing conditions was crucial to her success in the match.""Obviously today the main topic was the wind, trying to accept it and not trying to make it pretty -- just staying in the rallies, trying to be more smart rather than playing amazing shots.""Japanese tennis player and Indian Wells debutant Moyuka Uchijima delivered a commanding performance to defeat former US Open champion Emma Raducanu with a score of 6-3, 6-2.The victory earned Uchijima a second-round clash against world number three Coco Gauff.","Joao Fonseca defeats British player Jacob Fearnley 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 at Indian Wells.

'The next big thing' in Indian tennis blooming under Rafael Nadal's watchful eyes: Maaya Rajeshwaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/exclusive-the-next-big-thing-in-indian-tennis-blooming-under-rafael-nadals-watchful-eyes-maaya-rajeshwaran/articleshow/118757183.cms,"(Instagram Photo)

NEW DELHI: ""Learning, enjoying, and sharing time and experiences with these young and talented players,"" Rafael Nadal penned a post on X (formerly Twitter) not even a fortnight ago. The post featured an image of the tennis great at the center. To his left stood three teenage girls, and to his right, four more. On his far right, one could spot 15-year-old Maaya in her training attire, looking somewhat nervous, her right index finger tucked into her left fist.Nervousness was quite palpable - after all, the 22-time Grand Slam champion was right there in person at his Rafa Nadal Academy on the island of Mallorca, his watchful, forever-fiery eyes evaluating the teens.As for Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi , this was her first meetup with the ""King of Clay"" after taking the tennis scene by storm with her exceptional performance at the Mumbai Open earlier this year.But here's a fun fact: Mumbai wasn't even on her calendar at the start of the year.""First of all, playing the Mumbai Open wasn't even part of the plan. My wildcard was confirmed just 2 days before the tournament,"" Maaya, born to father Rajeshwaran and mother Revathi in a Tamil family, told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive chat. ""I was very confident that I'd compete well. Honestly, I didn't expect that I'd make it that far, but I just played match by match and gave my best.""Romping past opponents far more experienced than her, the rising star made waves across the tennis fraternity.As she reached the semi-finals at the Cricket Club of India and became the first 2009-born player to make semi-final of a WTA 125 event, some even clasped their hands in prayer, hoping for an outlandish title win. But a defeat to 27-year-old Jil Teichmann in the semis brought Maaya's dream run to an end.""After losing in the semi-finals, I was a bit upset because I didn't play as well as I hoped I would. But I had a lot of positives to take away from the Mumbai Open,"" added the rising star following the best series of results in her professional circuit so far.Even tennis was not part of Maaya's plan until she turned eight. For her, it was initially just a ""recreational sport"" after school.She decided to go pro when she was 10. At the heart of her journey are her parents, who, in Maaya's words, have been incredibly supportive.""I'm so blessed that my mom can travel with me. My home has always been my family, and also, I have a very good support system back home. Sometimes, I do miss them a lot,"" she told TimesofIndia.com. ""But specifically, I miss my dad so much. I'm very close to both my parents. I think if my dad would also be with me, I would feel very much like home.""At such a young age, staying abroad can make anyone homesick. Yet, this is exactly what Maaya had always wanted. She recalled, ""We were looking for a base in Europe last year, and the invitation from the Rafa Nadal Academy was quite surprising. But we were very happy that they took me in.""An avid reader and movie buff, Maaya also loves baking - baking, as she bakes, those chants already labelling her as the ""next big thing"" in Indian tennis. ""I'm definitely not worried about that. In fact, it's very supportive and encouraging to see people believe in me,"" she added.Currently, she is more into wading through the pages of the novel ""The Palace of Illusions"" by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni as Maya reflected, ""If I could tell something to my younger self now, it would be to trust myself and the good people around me, no matter what happened, no matter if I didn't win, I just had to do what I love to do with all my heart.""You've probably heard these sayings: A life without a goal is like a ship without a rudder, a car without a steering wheel... or, for tennis fans, Rafael Nadal without a Grand Slam (not quite a famous one yet), but you get the idea.What is it that always drives Maaya?""The ultimate goal for me is to become the world no. 1 and win slams,"" sighed the current world no. 1 Aryna Sabalenka's aficionado.","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi, 15, is the first 2009-born player to make semi-final of a WTA 125 event. Tennis was not part of Maaya's plan until she turned eight. She decided to go pro when she was 10.

'We were close to getting him': Woakes admits Gill’s control as India reach 310/5 at Edgbaston

Poll What do you think about the impact of shorter boundaries at Edgbaston on the game's outcome? It gives an advantage to the batsmen It makes the game less competitive It doesn't significantly affect the outcome It enhances the excitement of the match

As India closed Day 1 of the second Test at 310 for 5, the talking point wasn’t just Shubman Gill ’s masterclass with the bat, but also the noticeably shortened boundaries at Edgbaston - a move former England pacer Steven Finn linked directly to the Bazball mindset.""So we're here at Edgbaston. I stood right by the boundary rope, which is a considerable way in from where you may anticipate for a normal Test match,” Finn said on BBC’s broadcast. “England and their propensity to want to win the toss, bowl first and chase in the last innings maybe is the reason why those boundaries have come so far in.""Whether by design or not, it was India’s new skipper Gill who made the most of the shorter dimensions, staying unbeaten on 114 off 226 balls and anchoring a revival after India had slipped from 161/2 to 211/5. His unbroken 99-run stand with Ravindra Jadeja (41*) kept England at bay late in the day.Gill’s second consecutive century as captain, after his 147 in Leeds, comes amidst the high-pressure backdrop of India trailing 0-1 in the five-Test series. His hundred came via a delicate sweep for four off Joe Root - a shot that capped a day marked by grit and patience.Finn's observation added intriguing subtext to England’s tactical setup, especially after Ben Stokes chose to field again - just as he had at Headingley.Meanwhile, Yashasvi Jaiswal dazzled with a 59-ball fifty and made 87 before falling to a loose stroke off Stokes. Post-play, he lauded Gill’s leadership: “It’s incredible to see him bat... he’s very clear about what he wants the team to do.”Chris Woakes, who returned 2 for 59, rued missed chances: “A couple of decisions go our way early doors and then all of a sudden they're 30-3… it could’ve been a completely different day.”England will hope for early breakthroughs on Day 2, but with Gill standing tall and the pitch still flat, India hold the edge - short boundaries or not.",India closed Day 1 of second Test at 310/5 at Edgbaston.

That Moment

Brief Scores

India: 310 for 5 after 85 overs (Shubman Gill 114*; Yashasvi Jaiswal 87; Chris Woakes 2/59)

TimesofIndia.com in Birmingham: Kuldeep Yadav missed a spot in the XI for the Edgbaston Test vs England because the lower-order collapses were still playing on the Indian team management’s mind. Losing 7 for 41 and 6 for 31 in both innings of the Headingley Test meant coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Shubman Gill went looking for insurance down the order, even if it came at the cost of leaving a genuine wicket-taker out of the team sheet for a match where your premium fast bowler, Jasprit Bumrah, was warming the bench due to workload management.Not one, not two, but India made three changes for the second fixture of the five-Test series, and all those moves pointed in one direction—extend the batting depth, get that extra cushion in the lower middle order, and assemble a supporting cast for the three quicks Prasidh Krishna, Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep. The support cast for the bowling bit is a discussion for a different day, as the early spotlight was on the batting group India had. After a Test where the fifth bowling option was hardly used by Gill, the team decided to add a sixth, and it came at the cost of specialist batter Sai Sudharsan and also forced a change in the batting position of Karun Nair, who was promoted to No.3.There was an early hiccup with the wicket of KL Rahul, but the Indian change room would have been a much more relaxed place when Yashasvi Jaiswal got going with Karun Nair.Together, the duo dominated the morning session before that period of play right before the Lunch break came to haunt India again. In both innings of the Headingley Test, India lost wickets, and the trend continued at Edgbaston too, where Nair was undone by a Brydon Carse delivery that rose sharply to find his edge.It still wasn’t time for alarm bells, as a very confident Gill walked in and was ready with a plan for the passage of play. Just like the team selection for this fixture, the captain put a very defensive foot forward but looked very assured with his footwork and use of the crease. While facing Chris Woakes, he was way outside the popping crease and chose to use the depth while facing someone like Carse. Meanwhile, Jaiswal continued to be fluent from one end, while Gill was building his knock—one block at a time.The blocks have now become the highlight of Gill’s approach in England. There is a nice stride forward, the bat remains close to the pad to cover for the incoming deliveries that have troubled him in the past, and the head remains still and right over the impact point of the ball meeting the bat. Everything is so correct that he has often held the pose to turn muse for the photographers.It was a stark contrast from the way he built his innings in Leeds and clearly showed he wanted to bat long, and big, for his side. They had extended the batting, and Gill’s different approach seemed like a plan where he wanted the rest to bat around him.Jaiswal fell short of another well-deserved hundred against an opposition he has scored at least a fifty against in the seven Tests. Rishabh Pant came, survived, did his bit, fell to Shoaib Bashir, and Reddy shouldering arms to a Woakes in-dipper meant India were in a spot of bother with five, including the all-rounder at No.6, back in the hut.It wasn’t a moment to lose sleep over because India had beefed up their batting for situations like these, and Ravindra Jadeja was the next man in, with Washington Sundar still to come. One more wicket could have drawn curtains, but Jadeja resisted, Gill carried on, and India ensured there were no more casualties before the umpires flipped the bails and called stumps.The day had its moments for both sides, and while England will be the happier lot having picked five wickets on a wicket that didn’t have a lot for bowlers, for India, Gill’s unbeaten ton of class—his second in as many games as India’s new Test captain—helps them regroup for Day 2 with a healthy total on the board.",Kuldeep Yadav missed a spot in the XI for the Edgbaston Test vs England.

Bangladesh suffered one of their most spectacular ODI meltdowns in recent memory, collapsing under lights to hand Sri Lanka a dramatic 77-run win in the first ODI at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.Chasing a manageable target of 245, Bangladesh were cruising at 100 for 1 before losing seven wickets for just five runs in a jaw-dropping 26-ball stretch. From a position of dominance, the visitors unraveled in chaos and were bundled out for 167, gifting Sri Lanka a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.The collapse began with the run-out of Najmul Hossain Shanto, who had looked set during a fluent 71-run stand with opener Tanzid Hasan. Fresh from scoring twin centuries in the drawn Galle Test, Shanto called for a risky second run and was caught short by a rocket throw from debutant Milan Rathnayake, triggering panic in the Bangladesh ranks.Sensing blood, Sri Lanka unleashed their spin duo - Wanindu Hasaranga and Kamindu Mendis - who tore through the middle order with relentless precision. Hasaranga finished with a remarkable 4 for 10, including his 100th ODI wicket, becoming the second-fastest Sri Lankan to the milestone in just 64 matches, behind Ajantha Mendis.Kamindu Mendis, showcasing his ambidextrous spin, picked up three for 36, as the visitors wilted in a flurry of poor shot selection and nerves.Earlier, it was Charith Asalanka’s composed 106 that propped up the Sri Lankan innings after they slipped to 29 for 3.

Amid the blistering heat of Wimbledon 's hottest opening day in history, it wasn't just the tennis that stole the show - but a moment of genuine compassion from defending champion Carlos Alcaraz that left a lasting impression.Temperatures soared to a sweltering 33°C (91°F) on Monday, marking the hottest Day 1 since the tournament began 148 years ago. Organizers scrambled to keep spectators safe with added water stations, shaded areas, and staff equipped with refillable bottles. Still, the oppressive heat proved too much for some.Midway through a dramatic five-setter against veteran Fabio Fognini on Centre Court, Alcaraz noticed an elderly fan in distress. Without hesitation, he halted play and pointed out the incident to officials. He handed a water bottle into the stands as medical personnel arrived, delaying the match for over 15 minutes.Later that evening, a poignant moment unfolded off the court. The daughter of the woman who fainted posted a message on X, writing: ""Thank you @carlosalcaraz for the concern shown to my mum today who was taken ill during your match.

With the SuperUnited Rapid & Blitz leg of the Grand Chess Tour underway in Zagreb on Wednesday, all eyes are once again on Magnus Carlsen and Gukesh Dommaraju as their rivalry continues to simmer with tension, potential, and now, pointed words.Ahead of their rapid and blitz face-offs, former World Champion Carlsen didn’t hold back when asked about the reigning classical world champion. “Gukesh hasn’t done anything to indicate that he’s going to do well in such a tournament,” Carlsen told media as quoted by chess24. “I hope for his sake that he can play better, but playing him in this tournament, I will approach it as I’m playing one of the presumably weaker players,” he added.The remark has sharpened focus on the highly anticipated matchup between the 33-year-old Norwegian icon and the 19-year-old Indian prodigy. Gukesh may have held his nerve in longer formats, but rapid and blitz are Carlsen’s domain, and the veteran isn’t shy about underlining the same.Adding another layer to the mix, Carlsen also reflected on his return to Zagreb, a city he missed in 2024 due to the passing of his mother.“A little bit of a mixed bag for me,” Carlsen admitted. “It is a format that I really enjoy and a city that I really enjoy. I have lots of good memories, but I also have very, very difficult memories from not playing last year.”This week’s tournament will see Carlsen and Gukesh face off in one rapid and two blitz games.

Carlos Alcaraz marched into the third round of Wimbledon on Wednesday with a commanding straight-sets win over British wildcard Oliver Tarvet, as chaos reigned elsewhere in the draw with more seeded stars tumbling out.The defending champion and world No. 3 took just two hours and 17 minutes to defeat the 21-year-old amateur 6-1, 6-4, 6-4, showing his class while still acknowledging the home favourite’s spirited performance.“Big praise to Oliver,” said Alcaraz. “In just his second match on the tour, I loved his game to be honest. I knew I had to play my best tennis today.”Alcaraz, who has now won 20 consecutive matches including titles at Roland Garros, Queen’s Club, and Rome, is seeking to become the fifth man in the Open era to win three straight Wimbledon crowns — a feat achieved only by Borg, Sampras, Federer, and Djokovic.Tarvet, ranked No. 733, made headlines with his first-round win but must forgo most of his earnings to maintain amateur status as a student-athlete. Reflecting on his Centre Court debut, he said: “It was really special. It’s not every day you get to play maybe the best player in the world. I just tried to enjoy it.”While Alcaraz thrived, women’s fourth seed Jasmine Paolini became the latest high-profile casualty. The 2023 finalist fell 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 to Russian world No.62 Kamilla Rakhimova, joining the likes of Gauff, Pegula, and Zheng in a shocking early exodus.“It’s tough out there. Everyone plays well at this level,” Paolini admitted. “But I didn’t take my chances today.”The mass exodus of top seeds — now eight from the men’s and women’s top 10 combined — set a Grand Slam Open era record for most early-round exits.Aryna Sabalenka, however, stood firm. The world No. 1 saw off Marie Bouzkova 7-6 (7/4), 6-4, hammering 41 winners and setting up a blockbuster clash with Britain’s Emma Raducanu, who stunned 2023 champion Marketa Vondrousova 6-3, 6-3.“Honestly, it’s sad to see so many top players go out,” Sabalenka said. “But you better focus on yourself. I hope there are no more upsets — if you know what I mean!”In the men’s draw, Frances Tiafoe (12th seed) lost to Cameron Norrie, while Taylor Fritz (5th seed) survived another five-set battle, edging Gabriel Diallo to avoid joining the long list of early exits.","Carlos Alcaraz beat British wildcard Oliver Tarvet in straight sets.

NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill ’s captaincy journey in Test cricket has gotten off to a dream start, with the young Indian skipper notching up his second century as captain and seventh overall in the format. On Day 1 of the second Test at Edgbaston, Gill displayed composure, class, and command — all hallmarks of a leader settling into his role with confidence and style.This century follows his ton in the opening Test at Headingley, making it back-to-back hundreds in his first two matches as captain — a remarkable feat for someone taking over the reins from a seasoned leader like Rohit Sharma , who retired ahead of the England series.This tour marks Gill’s first assignment as Test captain, and he’s already making headlines not just with his decisions, but with the bat in hand.Gill’s celebration reflected the emotion of the moment. After reaching the three-figure mark, he let out a roar, raised his helmet high in the air, took a bow towards the crowd, and kissed his bat — a sequence that captured the pride, relief, and joy of the achievement.Coming in at No. 4, Gill anchored the innings after early setbacks and ensured India stayed competitive in a crucial Test they must win to level the series.India had lost the Headingley Test by five wickets and are trailing the five-match series 0-1.Gill has entered a rare league of Indian batters with centuries in three consecutive Tests against England. The young captain now finds himself alongside the likes of Mohammad Azharuddin (1984–85), Dilip Vengsarkar (1985–86), and Rahul Dravid — who achieved the feat twice, in 2002 and again between 2008–2011. Gill’s run of centuries across the 2024–25 England series places him firmly among the most consistent performers in this storied rivalry.What makes it even more special is that Gill is now only the third India captain to score centuries in back-to-back Tests against England, after Vijay Hazare — who did it in Delhi and Brabourne in 1951–52, and Azharuddin, who struck hundreds at Lord’s and Old Trafford in 1990.Gill has joined an elite list of Indian cricketers to have scored centuries in each of their first two Tests as captain. The list includes some of the biggest names in Indian cricket history — Virat Kohli, who scored hundreds in each of his first three Tests as captain, Vijay Hazare, Sunil Gavaskar, and now Gill.","Shubman Gill scores his second century as captain and seventh overall in Test cricket.

Yashasvi Jaiswal press conference: On Shubman Gill, confusion in India team selection and more

India batter Yashasvi Jaiswal backed captain Shubman Gill ’s selection decisions for the second Test at Edgbaston, Birmingham on Wednesday.With India trailing 0-1 in the five-match series, pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah was rested for the match due to workload management, with Akash Deep included in his place. At the toss, captain Shubman Gill explained that the team management believed Bumrah would find more suitable conditions at Lord’s.India also brought in Washington Sundar and Nitish Kumar Reddy in place of B Sai Sudharsan and Shardul Thakur — moves that strengthened the batting lineup. However, without Bumrah, the side looked notably different.By the end of Day 1, India posted 310 for 5, with Gill anchoring the innings with a composed unbeaten century. Jaiswal narrowly missed his own ton, falling for an aggressive 87.Gill, unbeaten on 114 off 216 balls, notched up his second successive century in the series, following his 147 at Headingley.

Poll Do you think India can reach a total of 450 runs in this innings? Yes, definitely Maybe No, unlikely

NEW DELHI: Former India head coach Ravi Shastri showered high praise on Shubman Gill after the young Indian batter notched up his seventh Test century on a gripping first day of the second Test against England, describing it as a ""disciplined performance"" where Gill ""looked fantastic and very solid. ""Gill, coming in at No. 4, displayed remarkable poise and application to remain unbeaten on 114 off 216 balls, an innings studded with 12 boundaries. His knock, which helped India reach 310/5 at stumps, was his second century in as many matches after a match-defining 147 at Headingley last week.""Shubman Gill has worked hard on his defence,"" said Shastri on Sky Sports. ""When he last came to England, he played with hard hands, pushed at the ball — a bit like Virat Kohli . But now, the top hand is much more in control. He allows the ball to come to him, trusts in his defence, and has all the shots in the book when he goes on the attack.""Highlighting the vital 99-run unbeaten partnership with Ravindra Jadeja (41*), Shastri added, ""India will be pretty happy. This stand has got them out of what could’ve been a spot of bother. But tomorrow morning is crucial — they’ll need another 150 at least. They can afford to lose just one wicket in the first hour.""Former England captain Nasser Hussain echoed Shastri’s sentiments, noting the importance of capitalising on the strong foundation. ""As Ravi said, they should be getting this total up to 450 and beyond tomorrow. My eyes are on India - can they make up for their mistakes last time?""Hussain also acknowledged England’s tireless bowlers, saying, ""It was a flat pitch. You can’t fault the effort. But this 99-run partnership turned the game. Before it, England were ahead - unlike Headingley.""As Day 2 beckons, all eyes remain on India to consolidate and avoid another Headingley-style collapse.","Ravi Shastri hails Shubman Gill's ""disciplined performance"" Former India head coach also praises Ravindra Jadeja's 99-run stand with Gill.

PANAJI: The Goa Cricket Association (GCA) has confirmed the appointment of Milap Mewada as the head coach for the 2025-26 season.Goa won the Plate division – meant for lower-ranked teams – last season with Dinesh Mongia as coach, but the former international is understood to have ruled himself out of the job, telling GCA officials that he is “unavailable.”Goa were then offered the services of Mewada and, given his profile, officials were quick to conclude the deal.“Mewada is an excellent choice for Goa,” a senior official told TOI after the GCA managing committee meeting on Wednesday. “His track record as batting coach has been excellent and he will be able to guide our players properly. Wherever he has coached, the results have been impressive.”A wicketkeeper-batter, Mewada never made it to the top as a player, consistently missing out on a starting spot for Baroda where Nayan Mongia was the first choice. He did play 11 first-class and 26 List-A matches as a wicketkeeper-batter for Baroda between 1996 and 2005, before commencing his coaching career where he made a name for himself, famously being appointed as the batting coach for Afghanistan at the ODI World Cup in 2023.Mewada, 50, has worked with several state teams, including Jammu and Kashmir, who he took to the quarterfinals of the Ranji Trophy in 2019-20. His other stints include coaching assignments with Baroda, Chhattisgarh and Hyderabad.“He will be Goa’s head coach with all other coaches reporting to him,” said the official.Former India pacer Dodda Ganesh has been appointed as the bowling coach, having previously worked as the chief coach for four years.","Milap Mewada has been appointed as the new coach of Goa cricket team.

TimesofIndia.com in Birmingham: India finished a hard-fought opening day of the second Test at Edgbaston on 310-5, led by a masterful unbeaten 114 from new captain Shubman Gill Walking in with pressure mounting and the lower order exposed, Gill played a measured and mature knock to guide India out of trouble.He found an ideal partner in Ravindra Jadeja , who stood firm with a gritty 41 not out, as the duo stitched together an unbroken 99-run stand to steady the innings after two quick wickets post-tea left India teetering at 211-5.Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal also made a strong impression, scoring a fluent 87 on a true batting surface before falling against the run of play. England’s bowlers toiled under sunny skies and on a flat pitch, but found enough moments to stay in the contest. Chris Woakes , who returned respectable figures of 2-59, reflected on the day by acknowledging Gill's quality.“He played very well, good for his team. We were close to getting him a couple of times, but he looked in control,” Woakes told reporters at the end of the day's play.Woakes explained England’s rationale for bowling first, citing favourable conditions: “We saw the wicket, and there was a little bit of grass. We thought it would do a bit.300/7 would have been a great day on a very good batting surface. Hopefully we can break this partnership and then into the tail.”Captain Ben Stokes continued his bold approach, opting to bowl first for the 10th time in 11 home toss wins.While India capitalised with solid partnerships, England’s hopes now hinge on an early breakthrough on day two to expose India’s tail. The Gill-Jadeja stand remains crucial, and with India holding the momentum, England will be eager to shift the balance quickly.",India finished the opening day of the second Test at Edgbaston on 310-5.

Birmingham: With 30 minutes remaining on the first day of the second Test, India captain Shubman Gill unleashed two cracking sweep shots behind square off Joe Root , bringing up his second century of the series in his third innings as India’s Test captain. He did his customary celebration, taking off the helmet and bowing towards the crowd and dressing room.It was a significant moment for this young Indian team. At stumps, Gill was undefeated and batting on 114 in an innings that again underlined his credentials as a batting powerhouse at No. 4. With an authoritative presence and remarkable restraint, Gill played one of the most defining knocks of his career.Incidentally, it was here at Edgbaston in 2018 that Virat Kohli cemented his legacy as a Test great with a superlative hundred when the rest of the batting looked out of breath.By stumps, Gill had safely taken India to 310/5 in the company of Ravindra Jadeja — batting on 41 — from a rather delicate position of 211/5. The efforts would have eased the nerves in the dressing room after the team was in danger of staring at their third successive collapse in this series, after Rishabh Pant holed out to deep long-on off Shoaib Bashir for a 42-ball 25 and Nitish Reddy shouldered arms to Chris Woakes’ incoming delivery.The other notable contributor was Yashasvi Jaiswal , whose fluent 87 set the tone and helped erase memories of his dropped catches in the first Test in Leeds.Minutes before the toss, it was cloudy, chilly and windy here on Wednesday. Traditionally, these are conditions apt for bowling first in England, although the pitch here was expected to offer very little to the seamers. England captain Ben Stokes elected to field first when the sun broke out at the time of toss, but for once, he was not expecting his bowlers to run through India’s top order.Instead, Stokes was laying a trap on a flat deck on a perfect batting day. If the young and promising Indian top order thought playing all 15 sessions of a Test at Headingley was tough cricket, Stokes and his bowling attack was about to put them through a day of attritional cricket.Gill responded with immaculate defence, his trademark punchy shots to the boundary and exemplary temperament to thwart England’s efforts. Flamboyance took a backseat as Gill fought it out in the middle.It was credit to Gill and Jadeja’s composure that India remained in the game and now can even hope to claim dominance when they resume on Day Two. Not only did they fend off a disciplined English attack which came hard at them at the fag end of the day, they had to shut out a vociferous and partisan Edgbaston crowd as well.India opted to go in with three utility allrounders in Reddy, Jadeja and Washington Sundar. It was the kind of selection that didn’t leave the established batters much room to fail. Gill’s exemplary application at the crease, coupled with his aesthetic stroke-making, won India an important battle on the first day.Jaiswal, meanwhile, made a remarkable comeback after a deflating fielding performance in Leeds. His knock was a departure from the rest of the pack, one that India are getting used to at the top of the order. Stokes’ celebratory sprint after he got Jaiswal to edge a short and wide delivery to the wicketkeeper suggested how much India’s opener was hurting England’s plans.","India captain Shubman Gill scored 114 in his third innings as India's Test captain.

Poll What do you believe is the main reason for India's poor performance under Marquez? Lack of talent in the squad Inadequate coaching strategies Injury issues among key players

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) and head coach Manolo Marquez have decided to part ways by mutual consent, ending an underwhelming spell in charge of the Indian men’s national team.The Spaniard, who had previously enjoyed success in the Indian Super League by winning the 2022 title with Hyderabad FC and the 2024 Super Cup with FC Goa was appointed India coach in June 2024. However, results did not go as hoped during his tenure. The AIFF Executive Committee agreed to release 56-year-old Manolo Marquez from his role after he expressed his desire to step down, even though he had a year remaining on his contract.India played eight matches under Marquez and managed just one win, which was a 3-0 victory over the Maldives in a friendly. Their latest setback came on June 10, when India suffered a 0-1 loss to Hong Kong in the third round of the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers. Despite the result, Marquez insisted India still had a chance to qualify. “We’re sad. The dressing room is like a funeral. But we’re still in the fight,” he said after the defeat.Frustrations had been building. After a goalless draw against Bangladesh in March, Marquez openly criticised the performance. “I’m very angry, disappointed with everyone,” he said. “Maybe this is the reality of Indian football.”India’s form has been on the decline over the past year. The team failed to win a single game at the 2024 AFC Asian Cup in Qatar, crashing out in the group stage. Since November 2023, the Blue Tigers haven’t won a competitive match and have slipped from 99th to 127th in the FIFA world rankings.Marquez was appointed as head coach in June 2024 for a two-year tenure and had replaced Igor Stimac as head coach last year.","The All India Football Federation and head coach Manolo Marquez have decided to part ways by mutual consent.

Gonzalo Garcia’s clinical 54th-minute header proved decisive as Real Madrid edged Juventus 1-0 at the Hard Rock Stadium on Tuesday, sealing their place in the quarter-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup.The narrow win sets up a last-eight clash with the winner of Tuesday’s other match between Borussia Dortmund and Mexico’s Monterrey. It was a mature and disciplined performance from Xabi Alonso’s Madrid side, who showed both grit and flair in difficult conditions.Adding to the good news for the Spanish giants was the return of Kylian Mbappe . The star forward, sidelined with illness, made his first appearance of the tournament, coming on as a 68th-minute substitute to a rousing reception from the 62,000-strong Miami crowd.The first half saw Juventus, led by Igor Tudor, start with energy and purpose. Randal Kolo Muani had a golden opportunity early on but chipped over the bar after being played through by Kenan Yildiz. Real gradually grew into the game, with Jude Bellingham and Federico Valverde forcing sharp saves from Juve goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio as Madrid finished the half the stronger side.The pressure continued after the break, and Madrid’s breakthrough came from a moment of precision.Trent Alexander-Arnold delivered a pinpoint cross from the right, which Garcia met with a powerful, well-timed header for his third goal in four games.“We had to be patient, we had to mature into the game,” said Alonso after the match. “This was a knockout tie — it’s about competing. You grit your teeth, and in the end, we had to hold on. I’m happy with that.”Juventus showed flashes of resilience, with Francisco Conceicao and Nicolas Gonzalez testing Thibaut Courtois, but their energy visibly faded as the game wore on. Tudor admitted fatigue played a major role. “There were ten players asking to be substituted — the tension, the heat, the humidity, and a long season took its toll,” he said.Mbappe’s return offered a promising glimpse ahead of the quarters. “Day by day, he will be better,” Alonso said. “I talk to him every day about how he's feeling. I think he will be much better for the next game.”",Real Madrid beat Juventus 1-0 to reach the quarter-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup.

Poll Are you excited about the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup? Absolutely! Not really Only if the issues are resolved

As the final eight of the 2025 Club World Cup takes shape with teams like Chelsea and Palmeiras booking their spots, the tournament has become the target of criticism from several top figures in the sport. While thrilling matchups such as Paris Saint-Germain vs Inter Miami and Real Madrid vs Juventus keep fans on edge, the build-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup has exposed serious issues in the revamped 32-team Club World Cup.From matches being disrupted because of extreme heat to pitch concerns and an expanded format, players and coaches alike have raised concerns. Despite solid turnouts at some fixtures, the overall experience, both on and off the pitch, has left many questioning the planning behind the tournament.Chelsea may have comfortably defeated Benfica 4-1, but manager Enzo Maresca was far from being satisfied. The Italian coach vented his frustration after the match was delayed by nearly two hours due to lightning in Charlotte, North Carolina, stretching the game to five hours.“This is not the right place to do this competition,” Maresca said, noting it was already the sixth weather-related delay of the tournament.“If they are already suspending six, seven, eight games, probably there is something that is not working well.”Poor pitch quality has been another talking point of the competition. PSG boss Luis Enrique didn’t hold back, comparing the playing surface to a pothole-riddled basketball court after his side’s 2-0 win over Seattle Sounders.“I wouldn't imagine an NBA court full of holes,” said Enrique. “The ball bounces almost like if it were jumping around like a rabbit.”Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham also mirrored his concerns after his side’s 3-1 win over Pachuca. “The pitches aren’t great at all. It holds up the ball, the ball barely bounces,” said the England star. “It’s tough on the knees as well. Hopefully there's someone who will look at that going into the World Cup next year,” the player told Sky Sports.Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp called out the tournament's expanded format, pointing to a packed football calendar and player fatigue.""It's all about the game and not the surrounding events – and that's why the Club World Cup is the worst idea ever implemented in football in this regard,"" Klopp told Welt am Sonntag. “There is insane money for participating, but it’s also not for every club... That means no real recovery for the players involved, neither physically nor mentally.”Despite reports of low crowd numbers at certain matches, some fixtures have seen heavy attendance. Eighteen group-stage games drew over 40,000 fans, and a record 80,619 showed up to watch PSG thrash Atletico Madrid 4-0 at the Rose Bowl, making it the highest attended game in Club World Cup history.However, weekday games saw poor turnout, with the worst being Ulsan HD vs Mamelodi Sundowns in Orlando, where only 3,412 fans attended a match delayed by storms. This wasn't the lowest in tournament history, but it reflected poor turnout in less-hyped fixtures. That being said, the opening match between Al Ahly and Inter Miami drew 60,927 fans to Hard Rock Stadium.Sweltering conditions have plagued several games, with temperatures soaring to 36°C during Bayern Munich vs Benfica in Charlotte. Chelsea coach Maresca described trying to train in Philadelphia’s “code red” heat warning zone as “impossible.”Games have featured mandatory cooling breaks, with players using ice towels and dousing themselves in water to survive the conditions. The threat of thunderstorms also looms large, with five games facing lengthy delays due to lightning within a 10-mile radius of stadiums.Even Bundesliga giants Borussia Dortmund resorted to keeping their substitutes in the dressing room during matches. Their coach Niko Kovac described the dugout atmosphere as of that to a “sauna”.As the Club World Cup moves closer to its conclusion, the football on display has had its moments, but the criticism surrounding schedule, climate, and player welfare are casting long shadows over FIFA’s revamped project.","The 2025 Club World Cup has become the target of criticism from several top figures in the sport.

With several new debutants and the tournament now being a month-long event, the competition has changed in stature.Now, teams from all six confederations - 12 teams from Europe, 6 from South America, 4 from Africa, 4 from Asia, 4 from North, Central America and Caribbean, 1 from Oceania, and 1 team from the host nation complete the 2025 line-up.With the group stage done and dusted and just 16 teams left in the running, it is fair to say that this edition of the Club World Cup has had its fair share of upsets, David vs Goliath matchups and some heated moments, literally and figuratively.Ranked 4,971st in the Opta Power Rankings, Auckland City went in as the lowest ranked side in the Club World Cup. They were grouped alongside Bayern Munich, Benfica and Boca Juniors.To put things into context, Auckland City are made up of amateurs, play in the Northern League in New Zealand, comprising just 12 teams.Auckland suffered a brutal 0-10 loss against Bayern Munich to start with - the biggest defeat in this year's tournament - which was followed by a 0-6 thumping from Benfica.Already eliminated and with nothing to lose, Auckland faced Argentinian giants Boca Juniors in their last game. In what can only be described as a David-Goliath matchup, the underdogs denied Boca a spot in the Round of 16, who were in need of a win to progress. A difference of 4,819 ranking points and Boca's historical success made the 1-1 draw all the more sweet for the amateurs.Grouped alongside giants Porto, Al Ahly and Palmeiras, Lionel Messi's Inter Miami were expected to be swept aside. Instead, the Argentine No 10, supported by Luis Suarez, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets, powered through to the Round of 16, after finishing second in Group A.While the Herons could only pick up one win, it was enough to qualify. After a stalemate against Al Ahly in the tournament opener, Miami were up against Portuguese giants Porto. In what seemed like a difficult task for Miami, Messi's timeless brilliance, exemplified by a stunning free kick, earned them a 2-1 win. Miami drew their final game 2-2 against Brazil's Palmeiras, and confirmed their berth in the last 16.Tensions boiled over on the final matchday in Group E, where River Plate needed a win to make it to the last 16. Inter, however, denied them that pleasure. At the full-time whistle, River's Marcos Acuna and Inter's Denzel Dumfries nearly came to blows, needing an entire team and support staff to intervene. The feud, which first began three years ago, saw Argentina's Acuna show Netherlands' Dumfries the 2022 World Cup trophy logo on his shin guard. At the tournament, Argentina had beaten Netherlands in a heated quarter-final which finished on penalties.Heated moments weren't restricted to the players, as heatwaves and extreme temperatures saw teams give their players ice baths and cold towels. Borussia Dortmund went a step further, making their substitutes watch the game against Mamelodi Sundowns from the locker room and not from the bench to protect them from the blistering heat. Their coach likened the playing conditions to that of a 'sauna'. Thunderstorms and lightning also resulted in at least five games being delayed.But it isn't just ice packs, but ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement) who have been a presence at the tournament, making it the first to do so. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will also be a part of the tournament's setup, with non-citizens needing proof of legal status to attend games.With less than a year to go for the 2026 FIFA World Cup , set to be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada, its precursor has revealed several issues. From pitch quality, to heat and weather in general, the tournament hasn't been a smooth one to say the least.Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham called out the poor pitch conditions, saying ""The pitches aren’t great here. The pitches aren’t great at all,"" said the 21-year-old after his side's match against Pachuca at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte.Besides the underdog stories, major upsets and more teams, the tournament still remains a hunting ground for Europe's best. Giants like Real Madrid and Manchester City still remain favourites to win the prize. Five teams from the eight groups - Seattle Sounders, Urawa Reds, Ulsan, Wydad AC and Pachuca - were eliminated without a single point.Group A: Palmeiras, Inter MiamiGroup B: Paris Saint-Germain, BotafogoGroup C: Bayern Munich, BenficaGroup D: Flamengo, ChelseaGroup E: Inter Milan, MonterreyGroup F: Borussia Dortmund, FluminenseGroup G: Manchester City, JuventusGroup H: Real Madrid, Al Hilal",The 21st edition of the FIFA Club World Cup has come to an end.

David Beckham (Instagram Screengab)

David Beckham is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery for a long-standing wrist injury, with wife Victoria Beckham offering fans a glimpse into his recovery.On Friday, Victoria took to Instagram Stories to post a photo of the 50-year-old football icon lying in a hospital bed, dressed in a hospital gown with his arm resting in a blue sling.Captioning the photo “Get well soon daddy” with a heart emoji, the former Spice Girl and fashion designer showed support for her husband, who sustained the original injury back in 2003 during an England match.Though no further medical details were shared, the injury appears to be related to the same wrist issue that had lingered since his playing days. Despite the discomfort, Beckham appeared in good spirits, smiling gently for the camera as he recovered post-surgery.Victoria also posted another touching image of David holding a friendship bracelet bearing the message “Get well soon” spelled out in colorful beads -- likely a sweet gesture from one of their four children: Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, or Harper.The hospital update comes just weeks after it was announced that Beckham would receive a knighthood from King Charles, officially becoming “Sir David Beckham.” Victoria marked the news with pride on Instagram, writing, “You’ve always been my knight in shining armour, but now it’s official.”The couple recently celebrated Father’s Day as well, with Victoria sharing throwback clips and photos of David with their children, calling him “the best daddy there is.”Married since 1999, David and Victoria Beckham continue to show that family remains at the center of their lives—even during unexpected hospital stays.","David Beckham is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery for a long- standing wrist injury.

Lazio have recalled Romano Floriani Mussolini to the club following his loan spell at Serie B side Juve Stabia. The 22-year-old right back is the great-grandson of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and son of Alessandra Mussolini, a former European MP for Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party.Mussolini initially joined Lazio in 2022 but did not make any appearances for the club. He spent the 2023-24 season on loan at Pescara, where he played 32 matches.At Juve Stabia, Mussolini established himself as a regular starter, making 37 appearances across all competitions. He contributed one goal and four assists during his time there. Despite Juve Stabia's interest in signing him permanently, Lazio opted to bring him back.Fascist fan groups have been present across Italian football, with Lazio's hardcore supporters maintaining ties to the extreme right since the 1970s. The club's historic ultras group, the 'Irriducibili', maintained friendly relations with similarly right-wing supporters at Inter and Verona.Verona's fan base has been involved in several controversial incidents.Their supporters have directed racist chants at Mario Balotelli and Franck Kessie, displayed swastikas in the stadium, and once arranged cars at a fan gathering to form a Nazi symbol in 2014.Some 20 years ago, former Verona club president Giambattista Pastorello stated he wouldn't sign a black player due to potential fan reaction.Nine years prior to that statement, Verona fans wearing Ku Klux Klan hoods hung an effigy of black Dutch player Maickel Ferrier from the stands. This incident occurred in protest of his potential signing, which was subsequently cancelled.","Lazio have recalled Romano Floriani Mussolini from Serie B side Juve Stabia.

My main goal is to keep learning and to help the team complete its program for the day, like we did in Jeddah, while also showing my pace.”Also Read: Season 11 Berlin Rookie Test: Formula E teams announce nominations, eligibility rules explained The Berlin Rookie Test will give rookies a chance to drive the GEN3 Evo cars.

Oliver Rowland’s latest win was in Tokyo



Oliver Rowland has multiple things to look forward to

Oliver Rowland is on the verge of winning the Formula E Season 11 World Championship. With four wins and three additional podiums in 12 rounds, Rowland leads this year’s Driver Standings by a massive margin. As the season nears its conclusion with the Berlin double-header and the London double-header remaining, the Nissan driver is almost certain to lift the championship trophy.Things began to look up for Oliver Rowland after he decided to switch from Mahindra Racing to Nissan last year. This season, he is all set to lift the Formula E World Championship trophy. Although he had a lackluster start in Sao Paulo, he bounced back with his first win of the year in Mexico. Soon after, he secured two podiums in Jeddah, including a win. He continued his strong form with double podiums in both the Monaco and Tokyo double-headers.After his last win in Tokyo, he brought his four-year-old daughter, Harper, to join him on the podium.

There was a lot of pressure to go through.I was looking forward to the race being over, to be honest, and when it was over... when I saw her face, I just couldn't help but be super emotional. ”""[The atmosphere] was amazing.

It has been held annually without a miss since 2015, and its scenic venue — the historic Tempelhof Airport — adds to its charm. Here are some interesting facts about Rounds 15 and 16 of the Formula E season in Berlin.One look at the Tempelhof circuit explains why the Berlin E-Prix is so special. With imposing aircrafts parked on one side of the barrier and a vast expanse of open space on the other, it’s arguably one of the most picturesque tracks in motorsport.Formula E cars are second only to airplanes when it comes to reaching top speeds — hitting 322 km/h in less than a minute. The most distinctive aspect of the Tempelhof Airport circuit is that it was originally designed for airplanes to take off and land, making it a unique surface for electric racing.The surface of the 2.343 km-long Tempelhof circuit is composed of layered concrete slabs designed for aircraft operations.While it supports Formula E racing, it presents challenges in energy management, tyre wear, and grip. The hot summer temperatures in Berlin can further test the drivers. Despite that, the wide layout, long corners, and even an indoor tunnel make the track exciting and full of overtaking opportunities.The Berlin E-Prix is a home race for DS Penske driver Maximilian Gunther. He won the event in 2020 and secured a third-place finish in 2023. The German driver recently expressed his excitement on Instagram. Reflecting on the Jakarta race, Gunther wrote, “Didn’t go our way this Saturday in Jakarta. Thanks for all the love, Indonesia. Now all eyes on Berlin – my home race.”However, it is TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa who holds the record for the most Berlin E-Prix wins, having triumphed three times — twice in 2020 and once in 2024. Envision Racing’s Sebastien Buemi, Lola Yamaha ABT’s Lucas di Grassi, and TCS Jaguar Racing’s Nick Cassidy have each won the race twice.Also Read: Season 11 Berlin Rookie Test: Formula E teams announce nominations, eligibility rules explained However, this year’s race may see a new winner, as has been the case in several recent Formula E rounds.

Most wonderful shots from Jakarta E-Prix

It was a dusty yet thrilling Formula E race in Jakarta, with the championship returning to Indonesia after two years. Formula E has now shared some of the best videos from the Jakarta E-Prix for fans to relive the Indonesian race again and again. The real footage appears as eye-catching as scenes from a racing movie — complete with synchronized reactions from the audience and ground staff.The shots from the Jakarta E-Prix were shared by Formula E on Instagram with the caption: “Our race in Jakarta would have made a beautiful movie.” The first video is a still camera shot from a turn on the circuit, as the GEN3 Evo cars speed down the track. It is followed by a clip of a Lola Yamaha ABT driver getting into the car ahead of the race. There are also a few shots of the audience and ground staff moving their eyes from one direction to another as the cars race past.The post also includes a glimpse of Cupra Kiro driver Dan Ticktum celebrating his win by standing on his car amid loud cheers from his team members. There are additional shots from different corners of the circuit, each offering a unique visual experience. One clip features Jake Dennis, who, despite securing pole position, was hit by Nyck De Vries during the race — ruining his chances of winning or finishing on the podium.A comment from Mahindra Racing’s Instagram page read: “If Wes Anderson directed FE.” A fan agreed, saying, “Accidentally, the dust and pollution in Jakarta matched with Wes Anderson’s color palette.”One fan reacted to the post, “Love the still camera angle.” Another said, “Ha, it certainly would.” One more wrote, “Straight out of a movie scene!” Another comment read: “I hope this event will still be held in Jakarta next year.

Do front row starts matter in Formula E? Oliver Rowland’s dominance says yes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/formula-e/do-front-row-starts-matter-in-formula-e-oliver-rowlands-dominance-says-yes/articleshow/122142779.cms,"Image credit: Oliver Rowland/Instagram

Formula E drivers with the most front row starts

Does pole position — or a front row start — guarantee a win? Well, in most cases, it does. If not, it at least enables the driver to finish the race on the podium or earn some points to add to their score in the Driver Standings. This season, it’s Nissan’s Oliver Rowland who has clinched five front row starts and is leading the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings. He is far ahead of the competition and is almost certain to have secured the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship title this year.Oliver Rowland is far ahead of the competition at the top of the Formula E Driver Standings with 172 points. He has taken pole twice and started on the front row in three other races this year.There is hardly any scenario in which anyone can beat him in the remaining four races — except one. If Pascal Wehrlein, who is second in the Driver Standings, wins and Rowland fails to score any points, then only can Rowland’s top spot be challenged. However, that is highly unlikely, and Rowland will most probably lift the world championship trophy in London with ease.TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein has three front row starts, including two poles.This suggests that front row starts do play a major role in a driver’s chances of a podium finish.Pascal, however, is behind Taylor Barnard, who has delivered the most impressive performance on track this year. The NEOM McLaren driver recorded four front row starts, including two poles this season. He already has four podium finishes in what can be considered his first year as a full-time Formula E driver.Meanwhile, DS Penske driver Maximilian Gunther, TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa, and Andretti’s Jake Dennis have two front row starts each this season. Among others who have grabbed pole position are Nissan’s Norman Nato, Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries, Cupra Kiro’s Dan Ticktum, and Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy.Also Read: Oliver Rowland’s daughter Harper turns four, Nissan driver shares glimpse of her birthday celebrations There are four more races to go before the current Formula E season comes to an end.

Watch: Extrication practice in Formula E

Every motorsport involves risk, where a single crash can prove life-threatening. Formula E has maintained a strong safety record over its eleven seasons so far. However, as a precautionary measure, Formula E drivers undergo extrication practice once a year to ensure they are familiar with the emergency protocols in case of an incident. Recently, NEOM McLaren driver Sam Bird participated in one such practice session. A glimpse of the session was shared with fans on social media, offering insight into this important aspect of motorsport safety.The video shows Sam Bird acting as an injured driver while the FIA Formula E safety team carefully lifts him out of the car and places him on a stretcher. The procedure is designed to avoid further injury, particularly to the neck or any broken bones.McLaren FE shared the video on Instagram with the caption: “Earlier today, Sam completed his extrication practice with the @fiaformulae safety team. This is an exercise that happens at each race with a different team each time. This is for both the safety of the drivers and the extrication team should an incident occur where the driver would need assistance exiting the car. Each driver has to do this at least once a year to ensure their own safety.Some fans were momentarily alarmed upon seeing the video. One commented, “Goodness grief — not me watching the first few seconds of this without context.” Another said, “That scared me there for a second.”In general, fans appreciated the behind-the-scenes look at Formula E's extrication protocol. “Never seen the neck wrap/support before, very neat,” wrote one. Another added, “Much love to the safety teams, always prepared and always do an incredible job.” A third said, “Awesome to see, safety above all.” One fan even joked, “An FIA-mandated nap sounds quite nice.”Also Read: Who is Sam Bird’s girlfriend Jess Impiazzi?

Training local marshals at Formula E circuits

Safety and technical knowledge are paramount in Formula E, where the sport involves handling some of the world’s fastest electric cars. Now, the FIA has given fans a behind-the-scenes look at how local marshals in each host country are trained before every Formula E race to ensure that operations run swiftly, efficiently, and to the highest standards.A video shared on the FIA Official Instagram page features Benoit Dupont, Head of Circuit Operations at FIA Formula E, offering a glimpse into the marshal training process at the Jakarta E-Prix.Speaking about the preparation in Jakarta this year, Dupont explains, “Before each Formula E race, we make sure that marshals are trained to the correct level to understand how to efficiently remove and recover a car. It's very important to have precise and fast operations. We've been in Indonesia before, but it was two years ago, so the goal here is to bring everyone back up to speed.”He adds that Formula E cars require a specific method of being lifted, particularly using a strap in a defined way. As a result, every post is trained individually to ensure marshals are fully up to date.Dupont also highlights the crucial role of the clerk of the course, who acts as a bridge between FIA officials and local marshals.He says, “Leaving a legacy is an important part of what the FIA brings to these races. There are international procedures that might not be followed at local races, so we ensure they meet the latest standards. That’s why we conduct training sessions like this,” he says. “The clerk of the course connects with the marshals, all the trackside personnel, and the recovery team. Since they communicate in their local language, the clerk ensures the communication line remains as efficient as possible.”Commenting on the video, one Formula E fan wrote, “Well done on showcasing these wonderful men and women who keep races going and clear up the mess after an OOPS moment from the drivers.”Also Read: Dan Ticktum shares unfiltered pictures and a note after Jakarta win, mentions losing F1 chance: “It wasn’t down to my attitude” The Jakarta E-Prix was a single-header this year, unlike its double-header format in the 2023 season.

In terms of numbers, India captain and opener Rohit Sharma may not have produced the amount of runs fans associate with him, but the skipper's intent in the ongoing Champions Trophy has had a positive impact on the dressing room, according to the team's head coach Gautam Gambhir India remained unbeaten in the group stage, beating Bangladesh, Pakistan and New Zealand; and went on to defeat Australia in the semifinal on Tuesday in Dubai by four wickets.After the match, Gambhir was asked a question on Rohit's performance in the four matches of the tournament, which have seen him accumulate just 104 runs at an average of 26.00 and highest of 41.A clearly flustered Gambhir came all out in support of Rohit, reminding the reporter that there is the Champions Trophy final to play.""Abhi to final hai Champions Trophy ka. Uss se pehle mai aapko kya jawab du? (there is the final of the Champions Trophy; what should I tell you before that?)"" Gambhir reacted.He went on to throw his weight behind the captain, saying that the number of runs scored by a batter is not how the team management evaluate performances, stressing on the impact Rohit has had on the campaign with his fearless approach at the top of the order.""If your captain bats with such a tempo, it gives a very good signal to the dressing room that we want to be absolutely fearless and courageous,"" said Gambhir.""You evaluate with runs, we evaluate with impact. That's the difference. You evaluate with stats, we evaluate with impact. As journalists and experts, you see numbers and averages. But as a coach and as a team, we don't see numbers and averages.""The coach added that Rohit is leading by example for the way the team wants to perform.""If it's the captain who is the first to raise his hand in the kind of cricket we want to play, then there can't be a better thing for that dressing room,"" said Gambhir.India were led by 'Man of the Match' Virat Kohli's 84 to go past Australia's 264 in the semi-final on Tuesday.The 2013 champions will meet the winners of the second semifinal between South Africa and New Zealand to be played on Wednesday in Lahore.",India coach Gautam Gambhir says Rohit Sharma is leading by example.

Chasemaster Virat Kohli fashioned another famous win for India in the semifinals of the Champions Trophy against Australia in Dubai on Tuesday, and his celebratory expression looking at wife Anushka Sharma after the match added the cherry at the top.Man-of-the-match Kohli scored 84 off 98 balls and looked set for another century, but closer to the win, he perished in an attempt to finish the game early when leg-spinner Adam Zampa had him caught at long-on by Ben Dwarshuis.However, the batting legend had done enough damage by then to allow KL Rahul (42 not out) and Hardik Pandya (28) to take India past Australia's 264 all out. Shreyas Iyer's 45 was the other important contribution in India's four-wicket win.Earlier, India's bowling was once again spearheaded by Mohammed Shami, who took 3 for 48, while spinner Varun Chakravarthy (2 for 49) and Ravindra Jadeja (2 for 40) claimed two wickets each.At the end of the match, the Indian players were all smiles, exchanging hugs and high-fives in the dressing room before they walked down to the sidelines, where Kohli was seen looking towards Anushka in the stands and punching the air with a big smile on his face.India now wait to know their opponents in the final, which will be decided between South Africa and New Zealand in the second semifinal.The match is scheduled for Wednesday at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.",India beat Australia by four wickets in Champions Trophy semifinal.

The script has become so familiar that it sounds boring now. Virat Kohli , run chase , big pressure game...We have heard this before, seen this before, but every time he puts on a chase masterclass, the instant reaction is to go wow! Not once does he look out of control and eliminates risk to a level where the knock feels like a soothing spell of a breeze on a dry afternoon. There is no sense of panic or pressure in his approach as he aces the calculation game to perfection and builds the innings one phase at a time.A solid start, busy acceleration and then the late flourish. One phase at a time. Kohli injects so much stability in the chase that the dressing room can afford to keep their feet up.264 was a par total but was always going to be a tricky chase in the high-pressure knockout clash against a side which has spoilt India's party plenty of times. The early departure of Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill didn't help, but Kohli rarely disappoints when the stakes are as high as they were today.With Shreyas Iyer , he steadied the ship and kept the required run-rate in check when captain Steve Smith tried to choke the period with a heavy dose of spin. The two right-handers ran hard, put the loose balls away and frustrated Australia for close to 20 overs.After a watchful period, there was a lot of fluency in the manner in which they operated and Kohli even managed to outpace his batting partner. They put on a 91-run stand off 111 deliveries with Kohli scoring 46 off 49 and Shreyas contributing 45 off 62 deliveries.While both remained solid, the difference was Kohli's ability to rotate strike and find gaps when the tweakers were rushing through their overs. The fifty was brought up with a boundary, an aggressive gesture followed and even after Shreyas's ill-timed dismissal, Kohli kept his eye on the 265-run target. Anything that came in its pursuit was going to be incidental.Axar Patel came, did his job of keeping the target within reach and left. That 44-run stand denied Australia the opening they were desperately looking for in the business end, and it was just a matter of time before ""Kohli, Kohli"" chants reverberated in the stands. It wasn't a packed house, but there was enough voice to build the anticipation for ODI hundred No. 52. They found their voice after the middle-overs slowburn and put on a real show when Kohli entered the 80s.Every run was cheered, every delivery became an event, but there was anti-climax in store when the set batter miscued the big hit off Adam Zampa to Ben Dwarshuis at long on. Silence took over again, and Kohli quite literally dragged himself to the changing room.Another hundred was there for the taking, the team was within striking distance of sealing the win. But the right-hander, after controlling and dominating the run-chase to perfection, couldn't be out there when the side crossed the finishing line. The ending of the script wasn't the usual one, but the rest of it remained on familiar lines.India 267/6 in 48.1 overs (Virat Kohli 84, KL Rahul 42*; Nathan Ellis 2/49, Adam Zampa 2/60) beat Australia 264 all out in 49.3 overs (Steve Smith 73, Alex Carey 61; Mohd. Shami 3/48, Varun Chakravarthy 2-49) v India",Virat Kohli scores 84 not out in India's 265-run chase against Australia. Kohli and Shreyas Iyer put on 91-run stand off 111 deliveries.

NEW DELHI: Team India head coach Gautam Gambhir on Tuesday hit back at critics questioning India's Dubai-only schedule in the Champions Trophy after India's four-wicket win over Australia in the first semi-final.""What undue advantage? We practice at ICC Academy, where conditions are different from the stadium. Some people are perpetual cribbers; they need to grow up,"" he said.Following India's victory, Gambhir remained focused on the ultimate goal. ""We've had a flawless campaign, but there’s still one more game to go,"" he told reporters. Virat Kohli once again proved why he is one of the best in ODIs, leading India’s chase with a brilliant 84 off 98 balls.His 74th ODI fifty ensured India successfully chased down 265, finishing at 267-6 with 13 balls to spare. Kohli also became India’s highest run-scorer in Champions Trophy history, surpassing Shikhar Dhawan.""Kohli is a phenomenal ODI player, and he plans his innings exceptionally well,"" Gambhir praised the Indian stalwart. Mohammed Shami (3/48) spearheaded the attack, while Varun Chakravarthy and Ravindra Jadeja picked up two wickets each to bowl out Australia for 264 in 49.3 overs.Despite Steve Smith’s 73 and Alex Carey’s 61, Australia struggled to capitalise on strong partnerships. Shami returned to dismiss Smith at a crucial moment, and Axar Patel removed Glenn Maxwell cheaply, derailing Australia's momentum.Kohli and Shreyas Iyer (48) added a crucial 91-run stand, stabilising the innings after early setbacks. Though Iyer and Axar Patel (27) fell, KL Rahul (42) and Hardik Pandya (28) finished the chase in style.With this win, India advanced to the Champions Trophy final in Dubai, where they will face the winner of South Africa vs New Zealand.",India beat Australia by four wickets in Champions Trophy semi-final.

India will face Australia in the first semi-final of the Champions Trophy 2025 in Dubai on Tuesday. This match comes less than 36 hours after India's victory against New Zealand at the same venue.India's success on Sunday with their spin-focused strategy has raised questions about whether they will maintain their four-spinner approach or add another pace bowler to support Mohammed Shami and allrounder Hardik Pandya.The Indian team may be considering utilising Varun Chakaravarthy 's mystery spin bowling against Australia in Dubai's spacious playing field. Their four-spinner strategy proved effective against New Zealand, making a modest total difficult to chase. Rohit Sharma admitted to being in a tricky position.“He has got something different about him, so wanted to try and see what he had to offer. We got to think a little about what to do for the next game, it's a good headache.

India vs Australia, Champions Trophy: Rohit Sharma & Co. out to avenge 2023 World Cup final loss

NEW DELHI: As India prepare to face Australia in the ICC Champions Trophy semi-final in Dubai on Tuesday, former cricketer Aakash Chopra has stressed the importance of the toss, pointing out that India have won all three group-stage matches despite Rohit Sharma losing every toss. However, he believes that the toss could be a decisive factor against Australia.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Chopra acknowledged India’s impressive run but warned of the potential impact of losing the toss in the knockout game. ""We haven't won a single toss thus far. Rohit has sworn that he won’t win the toss and won’t lose the match. It sounds alright, but the toss is a problem. Australia won the toss in Ahmedabad (2023 World Cup final) and, against popular belief, chose to bowl first. That decision played a critical part,"" he said.India have played all their group matches at the Dubai venue, successfully chasing against Bangladesh and Pakistan before defending a target against New Zealand. Chopra pointed out how difficult it is to chase at this ground.""When New Zealand bowled after winning the toss, I said they would die because they wouldn’t be able to chase if India scored 270. The truth is, even 250 wasn’t chased. So, this is the reality of this ground,"" he observed.While Australia do not possess a dominant spin attack, Chopra believes that setting a target of 270 would make India clear favourites. ""If someone tells you that the toss isn’t important and you can restrict the opposition while chasing, I disagree. If Australia get 270, it won’t be chased easily,"" he added.Chopra concluded with a direct appeal to India’s captain: ""So, in my opinion, the toss has incredible importance in this game. Rohit, please win one toss.""",India face Australia in the ICC Champions Trophy semi-final in Dubai. Former cricketer Aakash Chopra has stressed the importance of the toss.

""I didn't want to get comfortable with the idea of retirement. I have noticed that once you take a break, it becomes difficult to come back actively in a different capacity,"" the former goalkeeper told TOI here.""We players tend to compensate for the sacrifice we made by staying away from our families.

'Steve Smith cannot win a major tournament': Astrologer Lobo's huge prediction ahead of IND vs AUS semis

NEW DELHI: India and Australia are set for another high-stakes ICC showdown, this time in the semi-finals of the 2025 Champions Trophy on Tuesday. In a rematch of the 2023 ODI World Cup final , where Australia triumphed, India will look to turn the tables.One man who has been a thorn in India’s side is Travis Head . From his match-winning century in the World Cup final to his heroics in the World Test Championship decider and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , the Australian left-hander has relished big moments against India.Former Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh has made it clear: Mohammed Shami must get rid of Head early to shift the momentum in India’s favour.""Three things that Team India needs to do, which will be essential to win against Australia,"" Harbhajan said on Star Sports. ""The first thing is to overcome the fear of Travis Head and get him out. Shami saab, bahut ho gaya Travis Head ka kaam, ab unko run nahi banane dena hai [Shami sahab, enough of Travis Head, he shouldn’t be allowed to score runs now].""Head’s numbers against India in ODIs underline the threat he poses. In nine innings, he has amassed 345 runs at an average of 43.12, including a century in the World Cup final. His aggressive approach at the top makes him a game-changer, and Harbhajan believes neutralising him is crucial.However, Head is not the only Australian batter India must be wary of. Harbhajan identified Glenn Maxwell and Josh Inglis as two other key players who could turn the game in an instant.""Their lower-order batters, Glenn Maxwell and Josh Inglis, are strong hitters and deal in sixes and fours,"" he pointed out. ""They must not be allowed to score runs quickly.""Harbhajan also had a word of advice for the Indian team as they step into a do-or-die encounter. While the pressure of a knockout match can be immense, he urged the players to keep things simple.""The third one is simple — it’s a knockout match, and in a knockout match, one should not try too hard,"" he said. ""You have to play in the same manner as you have been playing.""With Head’s track record in crunch games and Australia’s ability to rise to big occasions, India will need to execute Harbhajan’s game plan to perfection. As the two cricketing giants clash once again, the battle between Shami and Head could set the tone for another epic encounter.","India take on Australia in Champions Trophy semi-final on Tuesday.

"A 'confident' Varun Chakravarthy buries ghosts of Dubai, achieves redemption",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-2025/a-confident-varun-chakravarthy-buries-ghosts-of-dubai-achieves-redemption/articleshow/118697840.cms,"DUBAI: It's difficult to describe Varun Chakravarthy 's relationship with the Dubai International Cricket Stadium (DICS)-but it's a place that occupies centrestage in his life's story. It was here, and in the other two venues in UAE, that he first made a mark, taking wickets by the bucketful in IPL-2020 and the second half of IPL-2021 to earn a call-up for India's squad for the Sri Lanka tour in 2021 and the T20 World Cup that year. Touted as a 'mystery bowler,' he was supposed to be India's secret weapon in that tournament.However, enduring a nightmarish time on Oct 24, 2021 evening at DICS, Varun ended up being hammered for 4-0-33-0 as Pakistan's openers Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan treated him like a club bowler while taking their team to a commanding 10-wicket victory over India in Twenty20 World Cup. A week later, Varun again went wicketless at the same venue, conceding 0-23 in four overs after being asked to open the bowling, as New Zealand thrashed India by eight wickets. Varun's so-called 'mystery' had fizzled out. It seemed that he developed stage fright, that he was rushed too soon after a few good IPL performances. However, unfazed by the setback, the spinner went back to the grind of domestic cricket, picked wickets consistently for Tamil Nadu and Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL, and was back with a bang last year, taking three for 31 in India's win over Bangladesh in the first T20I last year. It's a fairytale comeback which is turning rosier by the day.On Sunday night, Varun ruled at DICS, making a smashing return to a venue where he once failed to pick a wicket across three games in a World Cup. Fielded as the fourth spinner on a turning pitch, the 33-year-old destroyed the Kiwi batting line-up, taking five for 42 in eight overs, thus burying the ghosts of 2021 for ever, as he helped India canter to an emphatic 44-run victory.""Yeah, of course, in 2021, we didn't have -- I didn't, personally, have a great tournament here. But I do feel that I did bowl decently. But the results were not our way. But it looks good right now. And Team India is doing well,"" Varun said, talking about that forgettable phase in Dubai .Naturally, in the backdrop of his history with this venue, Varun was a bit emotional when he came onto bowl in the 10th over of the innings, before the -captain Rohit Sharma and the other senior India players calmed him down. ""The first spell of mine, I was a little nervous because the previous things, the emotions and all were playing..whatever happened in the last three years before on this ground was playing a little bit with me, and I was trying to keep it down, control it. But Virat bhai, Rohit and even Hardik were telling me to calm down. That really helped,"" Varun said.In three spells across ten overs, Varun left the Black Caps befuddled with his variations. He has now completely confused the Indian team management about whether to pick him for the semifinal against Australia on Wednesday-a hugely tempting idea indeed. ""He has something different about him, so wanted to try and see what he can offer. We haven't thought much about the next game, but it's a good headache to have,"" said skipper Rohit Sharma said post Varun's heroics.""Oh, he bowled beautifully, didn't he? I think he showed his skill tonight, the way he turned the ball both ways, and even the way that he could bowl pace. I thought he was brilliant,"" said Kiwi pacer Matt Henry , who took identical figures to Varun's five for 42, but was overshadowed by the Indian tweaker's spellbinding magic.Having seen him from close quarters for the past couple of years-he played a key role in his team's IPL title triumph last year, taking 18 wickets in 17 matches@24.88, KKR head coach Chandrakant Pandit feels that Varun is now a more dangerous bowler because of the confidence he has gained due to his success in the last few months.""India made 249, which wasn't a handsome total. Therefore, Varun's effort was special, in fact outstanding. He picked up wickets at the right time. Varun is a pillar of India's bowling unit. He's got many variations. From what I've been watching him in the last few matches, he has gained a lot of confidence. I feel that earlier, he used to be a little hesitant if a batter would attack him. He used to look a little confused. However, I feel that his character has changed a lot now, purely because his confidence level is very high at the moment, which reflects in his bowling run-up. Now, if anyone is trying to attack him, it doesn't matter to him. From a couple of deliveries that I saw him bowl, he has adjusted his variations in the air-some of deliveries are slower, while some go quicker. The main thing about his spell yesterday was that even when he was spinning the in or away from the batter, his line and length was good. That is his biggest forte. The pressure to defend 249 was a big challenge for him, but he showed courage and consistency, and his new-found confidence helped him too,"" Pandit told TOI.Pandit said that even the Indian batters, normally good against spin, were struggling to pick Varun in the last couple of years! ""I've had a lot of conversations with him in the last few years. He hardly speaks, but knows what he's going to do. And he has own plan as well. His acceptance level (to suggestions) is fantastic. whenever we, I and the (KKR) bowling coach (Bharat Arun) discuss anything with him. He knows his ability, strength, and he tries to deliver accordingly. It's not just the international teams-in the last couple of years, I've seen most of the India batters too struggle while facing him!"" the veteran coach said.Indeed, there's some enigma about Varun, which is why the Indian team management-captain Rohit Sharma and head coach Gautam Gambhir are so fond of him. Ahead of India's Champions Trophy 2025's campaign opener against Bangladesh, Rohit gave a 'soft warning' message to the opponent teams about how tricky it can guessing about Varun move for the Champions Trophy. The Indian captain said that Varun doesn't bowl all his variations, even in the nets. ""Varun Chakaravarthy has been impressive, he doesn't bowl in nets with much variation, I think he is keeping it a secret (laughs),"" Rohit said. Basically, Varun is a 'joker' in the pack-you don't when he will turn the deal in your favour!On Sunday, Varun even gave a peek about the multiple variations in his bowling. ""Basically, the ball that goes inside, outside and goes straight. So, you can keep it that way but there are minute changes that you can do with that also,"" he said. If only decoding his 'bowling code' was so simple!Interestingly, the five wickets that he took weren't Varun's best deliveries on the night. However, it's the 55 other balls that he bowled that seemed to have left the Black Caps in a tangle in their minds. Will Young, who played a googly onto the stumps, was his first victim. Glenn Phillips and Michael Bracewell were given out lbw-the latter walked off without even seeking a DRS review which would've overturned the decision. Mitchell Santner's off-stump was uprooted by a seam-up delivery , and finally, Matt Henry holed out to long on.""Yeah, I think I can do it better. But I would definitely not term it as luck. But it was definitely planned out. I planned out all the deliveries. And if it happens, it happens. In cricket anything can happen and can't term it as luck,"" Varun said.",Varun Chakravarthy returns to Dubai International Cricket Stadium. The 33-year- old took five for 42 in eight overs as India beat New Zealand by 44 runs. Varun had failed to pick a wicket in three games at DICS in 2021 T20 World Cup.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118697764,imgsize-26720,width-400,resizemode-4/118697764.jpg"

Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed found herself at the center of a social media storm after her comments on India captain Rohit Sharma ’s weight sparked widespread backlash. Facing criticism from former cricketers, BJP leaders, and even her own party, Mohamed later defended her remarks, insisting they were not meant as body shaming.In a now-deleted post on X, she wrote, ""@ImRo45 is fat for a sportsman! Need to lose weight! And of course, the most unimpressive captain India has ever had!"" The post quickly drew strong reactions, prompting her to remove it.Speaking to ANI after the controversy erupted, Mohamed argued that her comment was merely an observation on an athlete’s fitness rather than an attempt to body shame Rohit. ""It was just a generic tweet about the fitness of a sportsperson. It is not body shaming. I always believe a sportsperson has to be fit. So I felt he's a bit overweight and I just tweeted on that,"" she said.She further justified her stance by comparing Rohit with past Indian captains like MS Dhoni, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid Kapil Dev and Virat Kohli . ""I have the right. It's a democracy. What is wrong in saying this?"" she questioned.Mohamed also referenced past incidents where cricketers faced criticism, including when Virat Kohli defended teammate Mohammed Shami after India's loss to Pakistan. ""Let's not forget how Virat was attacked when he supported Shami. A good captain leads from the front, scores runs, and acknowledges opponents’ performances,"" she added.Her remarks did not sit well with former cricketers. Speaking to ANI, Atul Wassan dismissed her comments, stating, ""He is a World Cup-winning captain. Her remarks should not be taken seriously as she doesn’t understand match fitness."" Rohit's former coach Dinesh Lad also came to his defense, highlighting his recent performances. ""If Rohit was not fit, he wouldn’t have scored a century against England in the ODI series,"" Lad said.Former selector Sarandeep Singh reinforced Rohit's athleticism, saying, ""Rohit doesn't look unfit from anywhere. He has been diving on the field and performing brilliantly. We all are proud of what he is doing.""The Congress party quickly distanced itself from Mohamed’s remarks. Party leader Pawan Khera clarified on X, stating, ""Her comments do not reflect the party’s position. She has been advised to exercise greater caution in the future.""With criticism mounting from both cricketing and political circles, Mohamed’s defense has done little to quell the storm surrounding her remarks on the Indian captain.","Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed's comments on India captain Rohit Sharma's weight sparked widespread backlash.

India vs Australia, Champions Trophy: Rohit Sharma & Co. out to avenge 2023 World Cup final loss

South Africa’s journey to the ICC Champions Trophy semi-finals took an unexpected detour, with the team flying to Dubai and back within 18 hours. However, as they prepare to face New Zealand in Lahore on Wednesday, batter Heinrich Klaasen insists the whirlwind trip will not impact their performance.The travel chaos stemmed from the tournament’s scheduling, which required both South Africa and Australia to travel to the United Arab Emirates while awaiting the result of the final Group A match between India and New Zealand. With India securing victory and topping the group, only Australia remained in Dubai for their semi-final against India, while South Africa made a swift return to Pakistan.Despite the disruption, Klaasen believes the team is well-prepared. ""It was not ideal for the bodies, but we had some time to get out and walk about. We knew ahead of time that two teams were going to have to travel,"" he said.The quick turnaround meant the Proteas had to endure two flights of around five hours each within a short period. But Klaasen downplayed any concerns about fatigue, saying, ""We haven’t travelled a lot in this competition, to be fair. It was just a crazy 18 hours. We could stretch our legs and recover before we had to come back. It is part of professional cricket these days. There is not much more to say about it.""Now settled in Lahore, South Africa are shifting focus to the conditions they will face in their crucial knockout match against the Black Caps. ""It is quite chilly (in Lahore), so I think the ball will swing a little bit more. It is a good skill that needs to be applied. But Pakistan is a nice place to bat,"" Klaasen noted.South Africa’s recent record in ICC events gives them confidence. They reached the semi-finals of the 2023 ODI World Cup and finished as runners-up in last year’s T20 World Cup. Klaasen believes those experiences will serve them well.""The nerves are a little bit less because we have more experience in the semi-final department,"" he said. ""We are playing good cricket at ICC events, we have just had some bad luck and things not go our way. We are holding our composure in the bigger moments. The big boys just need to step up on Wednesday.""A victory over New Zealand would send South Africa into the final, where they would face either India in Dubai or Australia in Lahore. By then, the Proteas will hope their unexpected travel detour will be a distant memory.",South Africa face New Zealand in the ICC Champions Trophy semi-finals.

'Steve Smith cannot win a major tournament': Astrologer Lobo's huge prediction ahead of IND vs AUS semis

NEW DELHI: India and Australia are set to battle in the first semi-final of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in Dubai on Tuesday, marking their first ODI meeting since the 2023 World Cup final. Despite Australia’s dominant win in Ahmedabad, former captain Ricky Ponting believes India will enter the contest as favourites.""I think India are going to start favourites in this game,"" Ponting told The ICC Review. ""They haven’t had to move and travel. They’ve been training on those wickets all the time. Australia have rushed in to Dubai to get ready.""India topped Group A with an unbeaten run, while Australia secured their semi-final spot as the second-ranked team in Group B with four points. While some might wonder if India are still haunted by their World Cup final defeat, Ponting dismissed such concerns and suggested it could even serve as motivation.""You would hope that would be left behind in the dressing room that night,"" he said. ""They’ve got a lot of experience, a different coach. Maybe they haven’t even talked about it. Or maybe they use it as motivation.""India’s most recent victory — a 44-run win against New Zealand — showcased their ability to recover from challenging situations, something Ponting believes is a key strength of this side.""They had to find a way to stay in the game and shift momentum,"" he noted. ""Shreyas (Iyer) and Axar (Patel) did a great job. They bat deep. Even when they’re in trouble, they have high-quality players to step up.""Ponting highlighted the depth in India’s batting, making them a dangerous opponent even if their star players don’t deliver.""If Rohit doesn’t fire, Virat doesn’t fire, they still have Iyer, Patel, KL (Rahul), Hardik (Pandya). They have players who can get the job done in big moments.""While India’s familiarity with the conditions gives them an edge, Ponting cautioned against underestimating Australia, particularly in high-stakes matches.""India will start favourites, but I’ll never tip against an Australian team,"" he asserted. ""These are the moments where they play their best cricket.""He also addressed the potential impact of the toss, noting that conditions in Dubai might not favour chasing as much as they did in Pakistan earlier in the tournament.""If there’s no dew, whoever wins the toss should bat first. The wicket will probably slow down later. If Australia bat first, I think they have a much better chance than if they chase.""Ponting’s insights add further intrigue to an already thrilling contest between two of cricket’s biggest powerhouses. While India will aim to avenge their 2023 World Cup final loss, Australia will look to once again rise to the occasion when it matters most. With both teams boasting world-class talent and big-match experience, the stage is set for a semi-final showdown that could go down as one of the tournament’s defining moments.",India face Australia in the first semi-final of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in Dubai on Tuesday. It will be the first ODI meeting between the two sides since the 2023 World Cup final.

CHENNAI: Less than 48 hours after enduring the pain of losing the Ranji Trophy final in Nagpur, veteran Kerala all-rounder Jalaj Saxena was back on the field, playing the TNCA first-division match for Alwarpet CC that started on Tuesday in Chennai.After Kerala went down to Vidarbha in their maiden Ranji final on Sunday, Saxena made the trip to Chennai on Monday, reaching pretty late. Despite not having much time for a turnaround, the 38-year-old took the field in the eighth-round red-ball contest against India Pistons CC at the CPT-IP (Turf) Ground.On the opening day, Saxena did not just merely participate; he secured a five-wicket haul with his off-spin – his fourth of the season – and later walked out to bat as an opener. “I am a professional cricketer. I have been associated with The Sanmar Group (which owns Alwarpet and Jolly Rovers CC) for many years now. It is my duty to play these matches whenever I am available,” Saxena told TOI about his decision to not rest.“I want to show my commitment towards the team. Whenever I am available, I have to be there for my team. Till the time I play cricket, enjoy it and stay fit, I have to fulfil my duties,” added Saxena, one of the stalwarts of Indian domestic cricket.Saxena, yet to come to terms with Kerala’s defeat in the Ranji final, admitted that playing these long-format matches without a break has been challenging both mentally and physically. “I am still not over it (Kerala’s loss), it is painful. I am still feeling bad. But life goes on, such things happen in life,” he said.“It is an important game for Alwarpet (they are trying to avoid relegation). The body is tired after the number of overs I bowled in the Ranji final. But I have to push it. Generally, I work really hard on my fitness, both during the season and in the off-season.”On how he keeps the fire in him burning, even in the twilight of his career, Saxena said: “It might be impractical, but I am still hopeful of playing for India. That is what keeps me going. If you do not want to play for the country, you will not work hard enough in the off-season. You will not be able to perform, so I am taking it as a process. I know that it (India debut) is impractical, but I am just working hard for it. I do not have any expectations or regrets.”",Jalaj Saxena plays for Alwarpet CC in TNCA first-division match in Chennai. Saxena took five wickets on opening day of match against India Pistons CC.

NEW DELHI: Chase-master Virat Kohli on Tuesday emphasised the importance of India's victory over personal milestones after playing a match-winning knock of 84 runs against Australia in the first Champions Trophy semi-final in Dubai.The star batter played a crucial knock, anchoring the chase with composure and precision. His form has been instrumental in India's campaign, ensuring a spot in the final.India finally avenged its 2023 ODI World Cup heartbreak, turning the painful memory into a distant past with a thrilling four-wicket victory in the semi-final.Chasing a challenging target of 265, India achieved its highest-successful run chase against Australia in an ICC event, surpassing the previous best of 261 set during the 2011 World Cup quarter-final.Speaking after India's dominant win, Kohli said, ""It was pretty similar to the other day against Pakistan . It is about understanding the conditions and rotating the strike because partnerships on this pitch are important. It all depends on the conditions and then I play my innings. My timing, my composure at the crease, I wasn't rushed.""""The singles that I took were the most pleasing part for me. This game is all about pressure. If you go deep into the game, the opposition usually gives in. It is important to control your impulses. Even if the RR is six per over, I am not bothered,"" Kohli said.Kohli emphasised that team success matters more than personal milestones, which happen naturally when the focus remains on winning.""I don't know. That is up to you guys to break down. I have never focused on those things. When you don't think of those milestones, they happen. If I get to the three-figure mark, great, but the win is important. For me, those things don't matter anymore,"" Kohli added.",India beat Australia by four wickets in Champions Trophy semi-final. Virat Kohli played match-winning 84-run knock for India.

wants to inspire change through her story

NAVI MUMBAI: Honey Thaljieh knows the road she has travelled. Right from when she was a seven-year-old girl who would often pass by a group of boys playing football in the streets of occupied Bethlehem .One day, the boys invited her to join them and her skills caught the eye. It was just a humble beginning to a lifelong bond with the 'beautiful game'. One that would see Thaljieh become a co-founder and the first captain of the Palestine women's national foot ball team. One that would help her shatter stereotypes about Arab women playing sport.Football has indeed paved the way for Thaljieh to accomplish goals way beyond the imagination of that innocent seven-year-old girl whose footwork left the boys impressed that day. ""I grew up in such a context where I only wanted an opportunity and football gave it to me,"" Thaljieh tells TOI.It even helped her secure a professional career. For the past 13 years, Thaljieh has been working in Fifa 's public relations team. It's a role that has taken her around the globe, and brought her to India now for the third time.And wherever Thaljieh goes about her business, be it championing the causes of equality and inclusion, or promoting social development initiatives, she feels a sense of joy. A joy from being the influential figure she missed having in her life as a young Palestinian girl growing up in a hostile region.""Everywhere I go, it reminds me of my own story,"" Thaljieh says, shortly after delivering a talk to Pillai College students here in celebration of International Women's Day. ""Everywhere I am involved in projects, whether with girls, with boys, disadvantaged groups, slums, refugee areas, villages, all these disadvantaged groups at all levels, it reminds me where I come from. And that's where I find joy, because I strive to be the kind of influence I wished I had as a young Palestinian girl growing up in a challenging environment. I believe that every child deserves access to sports, and it should be recognized as a fundamental right.""On what is her second visit to the city, Thaljieh has been busy. From giving a lecture at the 6th edition of the Pillai Fifa CIES Programme in sports management and interacting with local students, to taking part in a friendly football game with girls from Slum Soccer - an NGO dedicated to uplifting underprivileged youth, she continues trying to bring about change.""I want to share my story with young girls to inspire change in their lives, because it's not acceptable that we still have children living under poverty,"" says Thaljieh who was also honoured by Soroptimist International, an organisation advocating for human rights and gender equality. ""I want a better world where opportunities are for everyone, regardless of their background, nationality, ethnicity, or religion.""Those words make you wonder about the plight of her own people, who continue to suffer the devastating consequences of the war in Gaza. ""The situation in Palestine has not been a recent development, it is part of a long-standing fight for equality, justice, and freedom since 1948,"" Thaljieh, who is based in Zurich, points out. ""I come from a land that should be synonymous with peace, yet it is mired in conflict. This drives my mission to advocate for justice and equality, as we strive to be recognised and respected as human beings with basic rights that everyone deserves. And that's why I chose football - to fight injustices, to fight inequalities.""It may not alter the immediate circumstances of her people, she concedes, but then Thaljieh is best placed to appreciate how powerful a tool, sport and football can be in transforming lives. ""Football can change the narrative of the Palestinian people. Football put us on the map,"" she says.""Yes, it's not going to change the immediate situation and bring freedom to Palestinian people in Gaza, the West Bank, or people from any war-torn place, but it empowered me to be here today and speak about justice and equality and freedom for all people.""",Honey Thaljieh is a co-founder and the first captain of the Palestine women's national foot ball team.

NEW DELHI: FIFA, the international governing body for football, has lifted the suspension imposed on the Pakistan Football Federation ( PFF ) after the necessary constitutional amendments were implemented to ensure proper governance of the sport in the country.The suspension was initially imposed on February 5 due to the failure of PFF Congress members to amend the constitution as required by FIFA.However, on Thursday, the PFF Congress members reached a consensus and approved the necessary amendments to the constitution. A PFF official confirmed that FIFA informed them on Sunday that the suspension had been lifted.Since June 2019, Pakistan's football affairs have been overseen by a FIFA-appointed normalization committee, tasked with conducting elections and resolving disputes between parallel factions.Despite multiple changes in the committee's leadership over the past five years, the core issues facing Pakistani football remained unresolved.Last week, a senior official from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) visited Lahore to persuade Congress members to adopt the required constitutional amendments.The changes were approved at a meeting in Lahore, paving the way for FIFA to lift the suspension.With the suspension lifted, Pakistan will now be eligible to participate in the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers .

Barcelona secured a dominant 4-0 victory over Real Sociedad on Sunday, reclaiming the top spot in La Liga after a commanding performance at the Spotify Camp Nou. An early red card for Sociedad’s Aritz Elustondo gave Hansi Flick ’s side a significant advantage, allowing Gerard Martin, Marc Casado, Ronald Araujo and Robert Lewandowski to find the net in a comfortable win.Atletico Madrid had temporarily knocked the Catalans off their perch with a win over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday, while Real Madrid lost further ground in the title race with a defeat at Real Betis. Flick made several rotations ahead of Barcelona’s Champions League last-16 trip to Benfica on Wednesday but still managed to move one point ahead of Atletico.Real Sociedad, sitting ninth, started brightly but fell victim to Barcelona’s offside trap, with Sergio Gomez’s goal ruled out early on. Barcelona playmaker Pedri Gonzalez nearly capitalized on a mistake from Sociedad goalkeeper Alex Remiro, but his deflection landed just over the net. The game’s defining moment came in the 17th minute when Elustondo was sent off for pulling down Dani Olmo , who was racing through on goal.Barcelona took advantage quickly, opening the scoring eight minutes later when Olmo floated a cross to Martin, who fired home his first-ever senior goal. Four minutes later, Olmo was involved again—his wayward shot deflecting off Casado and into the net for Barcelona’s second. The young Lamine Yamal continued to impress, setting up Pedri, whose shot from the edge of the box was saved. Pedri came even closer after halftime, rattling the crossbar from distance.Shortly after, Araujo made it 3-0, reacting quickest after Remiro parried Lewandowski’s header from a corner. Lewandowski then wrapped up the scoring with a clever finish, diverting Araujo’s low drive past the goalkeeper. The 36-year-old now leads the La Liga scoring charts with 21 goals in 25 appearances.Barcelona controlled the final 30 minutes without much trouble, though substitute Ferran Torres came close to adding a fifth goal twice. Real Sociedad defender Javi Lopez admitted the red card changed the course of the game.Elsewhere, Valencia salvaged a 3-3 draw at Osasuna, thanks to a stunning backheel volley from Umar Sadiq in the 87th minute. The Nigerian striker scored twice to earn his side a valuable point in the relegation battle. Valencia, now 18th, sit one point above Alaves, who drew 1-1 at Mallorca earlier in the day. In another crucial result, Leganes (16th) edged Getafe 1-0, moving three points clear of the drop zone.Barcelona now shift focus to their Champions League last-16 first leg against Benfica on Wednesday, as they look to continue their pursuit of silverware across all competitions.","Barcelona beat Real Sociedad 4-0 to reclaim top spot in La Liga.

MUMBAI: It's been one of the classic fixtures in the Indian Super League in recent seasons, and Saturday was another example why.Reduced to 10 men in the 58th minute, harshly they might have felt, Mumbai City produced a spirited second half comeback to hold newly crowned champions Mohun Bagan SG to a thrilling 2-2 draw at the Mumbai Football Arena .In a season where the Islanders have often looked vulnerable at home, Petr Kratky's side appeared to be heading for another defeat here when they found themselves 2-0 down at halftime. The visitors showed no signs of any hangover from the 1-0 win over Odisha last Sunday which saw the Mariners become the first team in the ISL to defend the Shield.A fine finish by Jamie Maclaren in the 32nd minute followed by Dimitrios Petratos's tap-in from close range (41st) had the Bagan supporters in the stands buzzing.Around 1300 of them belonged to the Mumbai Pune Mariners fan club. “There was already a plan to come for this game as there was the possibility of the title being won here,” one of the supporters told TOI.Odisha's loss, of course, spared Mumbai that embarrassing likelihood, but the Islanders had more to gain from this fixture with their playoff berth far from guaranteed.The Islanders gave the home fans reason to believe in another comeback when a wellworked corner routine was finished off in fortunate fashion (57th). Bagan defender Thomas Aldred's headed clearance off Valpuia's rightfooted attempt saw the ball rebound off Jon Toral's knee into the goal.Less than a minute after the restart, Mumbai were reduced to 10 men when Vikram Partap Singh picked up a dubious second booking following a tussle with Subhasish Bose. As often happens in these situations, the sense of injustice appeared to galvanise Kratky's men, and they were duly rewarded with an 89th minute equaliser through Nathan Rodrigues.","Mumbai City produce a spirited second half comeback to hold newly crowned champions Mohun Bagan SG to a thrilling 2-2 draw at the Mumbai Football Arena.

The race to the Serie A title remains closely contested after Napoli held rivals Inter Milan to a 1-1 draw on Sunday, thanks to a late equaliser by Danish midfielder Philip Billing at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.The result keeps the reigning champions just one point behind league leaders Inter.With just three minutes left on the clock, Billing slotted in his maiden strike for Napoli, shortly after replacing Billy Gilmour.On loan from Bournemouth, the 32-year-old capitalized on a driving run from Stanislav Lobotka, reacting quickest to slot home after his initial effort was saved by Inter goalkeeper Josep Martinez.Until Billing’s intervention, Federico Dimarco’s stunning 22nd-minute free-kick looked set to secure a crucial victory for Inter in their title defense.Simone Inzaghi’s side found themselves under intense pressure for much of the match and had to rely on desperate defending in a bid to claim all three points.Inzaghi's plans were disrupted when both Federico Dimarco and Hakan Calhanoglu were forced off with injuries shortly after halftime, while Marcus Thuram also had to be replaced by Joaquin Correa in his first game back from an ankle injury.Inter could hardly have faced Napoli at a more opportune moment, with Antonio Conte’s side stumbling through February, collecting just three points from four matches after previously appearing destined for a second title in three seasons.However, despite Inter’s resilient defensive effort—marked by last-ditch tackles and desperate clearances—their resistance was finally broken by Billing, who rescued his new team in just his second appearance since signing in January.Billing’s late equalizer also offered a lifeline to Atalanta, who extended their winless run at home to five Serie A matches, but remain third, after a goalless draw against Venezia. They are three points behind Inter.Gian Piero Gasperini’s side are still in the title race but have struggled to deliver in front of their home fans, failing to win a domestic fixture in Bergamo since the start of the year. They missed a golden opportunity to draw level with Inter before the showdown in Naples.Davide Zappacosta came closest to scoring five minutes before halftime, striking the outside of the post after excellent work from Ademola Lookman.Lookman himself squandered a one-on-one chance against Venezia goalkeeper Ionut Radu earlier in the match and later blazed over from close range in the 82nd minute.",Philip Billing scores late equaliser as Napoli draw 1-1 with Inter Milan.

Manchester City overcame a first-half scare to defeat Plymouth Argyle 3-1 at the Etihad on Saturday, securing their place in the FA Cup quarter-finals.

Star striker Erling Haaland, who started on the bench, came on late and assisted Kevin De Bruyne for City’s third goal in stoppage time.Crystal Palace’s derby victory over Millwall was marred by a horrifying injury to Mateta, who was stretchered off after being accidentally kicked in the head by Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts just eight minutes into the match.Roberts, who initially won the ball, caught Mateta with his boot while clearing outside the penalty area. After a VAR review, referee Michael Oliver upgraded his initial decision to a red card.Palace manager Oliver Glasner was furious, stating the tackle could have ended Mateta's career. ""Just imagine if he hits his face straight, with his power, with the studs, it is the end of JP's career,"" he said.Mateta later reassured fans on Instagram: ""Thank you for all your kind messages. I'm doing well. I hope to be back very soon. And stronger than ever.""Palace capitalised on their numerical advantage, with Japhet Tanganga’s own goal opening the scoring in the 33rd minute. Daniel Muñoz doubled the lead before Millwall’s Wes Harding pulled one back in first-half stoppage time. Eddie Nketiah sealed the win for Palace with a late looping header.Bournemouth reached the quarter-finals for only the third time in their history after a dramatic 5-4 penalty shootout win over Wolves following a 1-1 draw.Evanilson’s first-half strike was followed by VAR controversy when Milos Kerkez had a goal ruled out for offside after an eight-minute review, due to a failure of the semi-automated system.Matheus Cunha equalised with a stunning strike for Wolves but was later sent off for violent conduct after clashing with Kerkez. In the shootout, Luis Sinisterra converted the winning penalty after Wolves' Boubacar Traoré hit the crossbar.Preston North End ended Burnley’s 23-game unbeaten run with a dominant 3-0 victory at Deepdale. Milutin Osmajic, who was previously accused of racist abuse by Burnley’s Hannibal Mejbri, taunted opposition fans after scoring the second goal. Robbie Brady and Will Keane were also on target as Preston progressed to the FA Cup quarter-finals for the first time since 1966.",Manchester City beat Plymouth Argyle 3-1 at the Etihad. Nico O'Reilly scored twice from set-pieces to turn the tie around. Bournemouth beat Wolves 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw.

WTA Merida Open

Mérida:

World number four Jessica Pegula powered to her first WTA title of 2025 on Sunday, beating McCartney Kessler 7-5, 6-2 in an all-American final in Austin, Texas.Pegula, the top seed, claimed a seventh WTA title and her first since she won the 1000 event in Toronto last year.That was one of Pegula's two titles in a 2024 campaign in which she also reached the US Open final.In Kessler she stopped a fast-rising talent, whose first two WTA finals had yielded a pair of titles -- in Cleveland last August and at Hobart in January.The 25-year-old arrived in Austin riding high after claiming her first career top-10 player with an upset of Coco Gauff in the second round at Dubai.But she couldn't find a way past Pegula, who snapped a three-match losing streak in finals for a confidence-building crown heading into the prestigious hard court tournaments at Indian Wells and Miami.Pegula, the only top-10 player in the draw, dropped just one set all week.Kessler looked set to change that when she rallied from 0-2 down to take a 4-2 lead in the first set.But too many unforced errors from Kessler allowed Pegula to get back in front and after Kessler missed a chance to break in the 11th game she was broken in the next as Pegula pocketed the first set.Kessler broke Pegula to open the second, but Pegula won the next four games to seize control.Top-seeded American Emma Navarro capped a dominant week with a 6-0, 6-0 thrashing of qualifier Emiliana Arango in the final of the WTA Merida Open on Sunday.Navarro, seeded No. 1 for the first time, marched to her second WTA title without dropping a set, adding the 500-level crown to the title she won in Hobart last year.Navarro hadn't reached a final since, although she made it to the quarter-finals or better at the last three Grand Slams and came into the week ranked 10th in the world.She needed just 55 minutes to subdue Arango, becoming the first player to win a WTA final 6-0, 6-0 since Iga Swiatek blanked Karolina Pliskova in the 2021 Rome title match.Arango, a 24-year-old Colombian who made it past the quarter-finals of a WTA tournament for the first time this week, came into the tournament ranked 133rd in the world and will crack the top 100 when the new rankings are announced on Monday.","Jessica Pegula wins WTA title in Austin, Texas.

DUBAI: The US Open's decision to cut and change the draw of its mixed-doubles event has divided the locker-room on the men's and women's tours. The Open's plan is to reschedule mixed-doubles as a standalone feature during the qualifying draw, tossing out $1 million in prize-money.This year's mixed-doubles event in New York, perhaps inspired by the vibe of last year's 'Mixed Madness' mela, will feature 16 pairs as against the 32 that make up mixed-doubles draws at Grand Slams. It will be played on August 19-20, three days before the start of the main draw. The qualification process has also been changed, with eight teams earning direct entry courtesy their combined singles ranking, while the other eight teams will be wildcard entries. Rohan Bopanna , still going strong in doubles at almost 45 years, said it was a lost opportunity for doubles specialists, who look forward to playing two events in Grand Slams -- doubles and mixed doubles. ""I don't think any doubles players can really play the mixed doubles. This year's US Open will be the first Grand Slam where we are not playing two events,"" Bopanna told TOI on the sidelines of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis championships here.Bopanna believes doubles is still a popular option for singles players on the ATP Tour. ""All the guys who enjoy doubles play doubles on the circuit,"" Bopanna said. ""The system is such that you can use singles ranking to get into doubles, on the ATP Tour you see a bunch of guys playing doubles and they enjoy it.""Yuki Bhambri, the India No.2 in the individual doubles ranking, said the USTA knew exactly what they were doing when they wrung in the changes. ""Grand Slams especially have always talked about tradition, that's why they never want to shorten matches,"" he said. ""They do that when it suits them, obviously business over (other) interests. The mixed doubles for a lot of countries like Great Britain, India and Australia has been a source of Grand Slam achievement. You're never going to get an opportunity like that with what they've done.""""You're essentially having the singles guys play a practice week,"" the 32-year-old Bhambri said, adding, ""It is obviously a sad day and a loss for a lot of the doubles players. We've all spoken about that, everyone is aware of what they've done and how they've gone about it.""Last year's Mixed Madness exhibition event before the start of the main draw saw a number of high-profile singles players pairing up. American Coco Gauff said she wouldn't be playing the mixed event this time even though she enjoyed being a part of Mixed Madness last year. ""It's an interesting situation because (on one side) some (players) rely on mixed doubles and it's an event that's been there forever. On the other hand, I know they're trying to get more singles players involved, maybe grow the sport,"" Gauff said, ""I most likely won't be participating just because it's not a great time for me, it will take away from the preparation for US Open.""",The US Open has cut and changed the draw of its mixed-doubles event.

Stefanos Tsitsipas secured his first title in nearly a year by defeating Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-3, 6-3 in the Dubai final on Saturday.""There is nothing that ensured the win today, it was just pure fighting,"" said Tsitsipas after winning in one hour and 28 minutes.The Greek player ended his unsuccessful run in ATP 500-level finals with this victory.While Tsitsipas has previously won the season-ending ATP Finals and top-tier ATP 1000 events, he had lost all 11 of his previous finals at 500 tournaments, including two defeats in Dubai to Roger Federer in 2019 and Novak Djokovic in 2020.""It's a big relief that I'm able to hold that trophy after the third attempt. It's something that I had in the back of my mind, and I'm happy to say I accomplished it.""Unseeded Canadian Auger-Aliassime entered the match with the momentum, having won tournaments in Adelaide in January and Montpellier in February.""I had a great opponent on the other side of the net, I knew it was a difficult task. I'm just proud of the way I managed the pressure and was able to perform in those crucial moments.""Tsitsipas controlled the match from the baseline and maintained his serve throughout, despite facing break points twice in each set.He broke the Canadian's serve in the seventh and ninth games of the first set, and secured the decisive break in the eighth game of the second set.Tsitsipas, who had fallen from world No.3 in early 2023 to 11th place, will climb to ninth when the ATP rankings update on Monday.""These are the things we are fighting for as professional tennis players. To be owning a spot in the top 10 is definitely one of the greatest feelings a tennis player can experience. It comes with hard work and sacrifices, but I'm happy that I'm in a position where I can really celebrate.""",Stefanos Tsitsipas beats Felix Auger-Aliassime in Dubai final.

DUBAI: The thread running through Stefanos Tsitsipas ’ run at the Dubai Duty Free tennis championship this week has been his fight, not the lack of it. The gifted Greek appeared lost on the court for most part of the last couple of years, and it gradually reflected on his ranking which dipped out of the top-10 for the first time in five years last Feb.The 26-year-old backed himself with successive three set wins over Karen Khachanov and Matteo Berrettini to make the last-four here, his first ATP 500 semis since last July. Tsitsipas then beat Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor 6-4, 6-4 to make the final, where he meets Felix Auger-Aliassime .""The ability to fight is the most important one for an athlete, once you lose that, you are useless on the court,"" Tsitsipas said. ""There is no match without fighting, you have to fight. The best victories are the ones you fought for. You’re not in control (of the match) and you somehow find that little gap and you win the match, that’s the most thrilling moment a tennis player can experience.""You feel a little lost, not that confident with certain things that you have done to your game,"" Tsitsipas said of the road back. ""It’s difficult to fake the confidence. It helps if you win, and you see yourself in the level that you are kind of imagining in your mind. That brings you confidence.""The World No.11 – a six-time Grand Slam semifinalist, and twice finalist at Roland Garros (2021) and Australian Open (2023) – rued the lost opportunity of seasons gone. ""I wish I had more of those matches where I fought and came back and won,"" he said. ""There were not enough of those moments in 2024. I need to recreate those moments.""Not unsurprisingly, the Tsitsipas corner wears a different look these days. Tsitsipas’ father Apostolos, a disruptive presence at courtside, was his longtime coach until the 6-feet-4 pro announced in Aug that he wouldn’t be working with his father any longer and introduced his new coach Dimitris Chatzinikolaou , the Greek Davis Cup captain.","Stefanos Tsitsipas is through to the final of the Dubai Duty Free tennis championship.

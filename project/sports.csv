Even hours after the champagnes were popped, peppy Punjabi music reverberated in the stadium and multiple selfies were clicked, the party was not over in Dubai. The euphoria of India's 2025 Champions Trophy win gripped the city and hundreds gathered outside the team hotel to catch a glimpse of their favourite superstar with the white coat on and the winners medal around their necks.Deafening chants could be heard from a fair distance when Team India's bus, escorted by police cars, reached a luxury hotel around 11pm local time in the busy neighbourhood not far away from the iconic Burj Khalifa.The hotel staff had their task cut out as the fans were itching to see the players but they did a commendable job in masking the passage and ensuring a seamless entry into the premises.There were some fireworks and flower shower for the players, and within no time they reached their respective floors without the fans getting a wind of it. The chanting continued and the tri-colour was aggressively waved but the repeated pleas were not going to be heard.""Sir, bahar bula do. Balcony mai bula do ek baar, hum tabse khade hai (sir please call them in the balcony once, we are standing for a long time),"" pleaded fans to the Indian security guard stationed at the main entrance. ""Oh ghar jaao bhai, ab wo aaram karege. Khaaege, peeyege, mauj karege. Ab nahi aaege (go home, they will rest now. They will eat, drink, enjoy. They won't come now),"" came the quick retort but it wasn't convincing enough for the hundreds who were ready to camp near the drop-off zone.Some gave up and happily went home after getting selfies with Indian cricket team fans Sudhir and Ram Babu but plenty kept lurking around the hotel for just one glimpse of the star players.Nearly three hours had passed since the fireworks went off at the Dubai International Stadium and a big fat party got underway away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The younger lot of the team didn't miss a beat while shaking their leg and the seniors were soaking in the moment and celebrating with their family members and loved ones.Captain Rohit Sharma's wife Ritika and daughter, Virat Kohli's wife Anushka, Ravindra Jadeja's family and Mohammed Shami's family were all present at the ground before the presentation ceremony got underway and everyone's mobile phone were working overtime to record these memories of a lifetime.Away from the bunch, moments after getting the medal and white blazer, Hardik Pandya broke away from the pack and did his iconic pose with the trophy on the playing surface. He was soon joined by teammates and then everyone sat down for more pictures.Near the boundary ropes, Gautam Gambhir indulged in the herculean task that is doing shayari with former India cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu who even forced the head coach to do some bhangra during their brief chat.Virat and Rohit meanwhile broke into dandiya with the stumps and the Indian captain's two-line comment after that is going absolutely viral on social media.There were multiple interviews which followed and a sense of satisfaction was written all over the faces of the players who gave their all in last few weeks in Dubai.The Indian cricket team landed in Dubai on February 15 and the unbeaten run in the tournament gave them their second ICC title in two years and third Champions Trophy overall, and priceless moments.The party would have certainly continued afterhours in the team hotel but everyone would have ensured a sound sleep before they catch the flight back home on March 10.",India won the Champions Trophy for the third time on Sunday after beating New Zealand in the final.

NEW DELHI: Cricketers have their own ways of celebrating big tournaments victories, often depending on the team's culture, the tournament's significance, and individual personalities.Players pop champagne bottles or energy drinks and drench each other in water, soft drinks.Players take a lap around the stadium to thank the fans, often with national flags, while some players engage in playful acts like imitating famous celebrations.Dancing to loud music is a common sight, with some players showing off their unique moves.When India had won the 2013 edition of the Champions Trophy under the captaincy of MS Dhoni after defeating England in the final at Edgbaston in Birmingham on June 23, Virat Kohli showed off his dance moves by grooving to Gangnam style and also doing pushups in front of his teammates.Cut to March 9, 2025, India won their third Champions Trophy title after defeating New Zealand by 4 wickets in the final in Dubai, with Virat now a former captain and the elder statesman of the team.So this time, it was Shreyas Iyer who showed off his dance skills, which he has so often done on social media, as the Indian cricketers celebrated with the trophy.The International Cricket Council ( ICC ) shared clips of both celebratory dances from 2013 and 2025 with the caption, ""Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer sure know how to groove.""India surpassed Australia, who had two titles, by adding trophies in 2002 and 2013.India, the top-ranked ODI team in the world, stayed undefeated in the eight-nation competition held in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.India played all their matches at the Dubai International Stadium after they refused to tour hosts Pakistan.","Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer show off dance moves after winning Champions Trophy.

NEW DELHI: The failure of the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) to send a single representative to Sunday's 2025 Champions Trophy final at the Dubai International Stadium has drawn harsh criticism.International Cricket Council ( ICC ) chairman Jay Shah , Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Roger Binny and secretary Devajit Saikia, and New Zealand Cricket (NZC) director Roger Twose shared the podium to award players with the trophy after India defeated New Zealand by four wickets in the final.Sumair Ahmed, the PCB chief operations officer and the Champions Trophy event director, was in Dubai but was not given a podium invitation.According to a report by Telecom Asia Sport, Mohsin Naqvi, the chairman of the PCB, was unable to visit Dubai because of his official duties as the nation's interior minister. President Asif Zardari was scheduled to speak at the joint parliament session in Islamabad, and Mohsin had informed the ICC that he was occupied with that.Former fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar claimed on social media that it was ""beyond his understanding"" that Pakistan had not sent a single representative to the stage.""India has won the ICC Champions Trophy today but I noticed something strange. Pakistan were the hosts in the tournament but there were no Pakistan Cricket Board representatives here (at the trophy presentation). This is beyond my understanding. Why was there no one to represent us and give the trophy? Please think about it, it's a world stage but sadly I could not see any PCB members. Feeling very down to see that,"" said Akhtar in a video posted on X.The fact that the PCB chairman did not attend the celebration because India had advanced to the final and emerged victorious is seen by some former Pakistani players as a negative indication.After losing to New Zealand and India, the hosts were humiliatingly ousted in the group round of the 2025 Champions Trophy, which was Pakistan's first home tournament in 29 years.The PCB delegate Sumair was there in Dubai, but he was not called to the stage, even though the report states that the ICC chooses which guests will stand at the podium.But a post by a Pakistani journalist claimed that, ""Mohsin Naqvi was supposed to attend the final and presentation but he wasn't feeling well and was unable to attend it.""","Pakistan did not send a single representative to Sunday's 2025 Champions Trophy final.

Rachin Ravindra has been a revelation for New Zealand . His century in the semifinal against South Africa underscored his ability to anchor an innings as well as accelerate when needed.Ravindra's approach to counter India's spinning quartet could significantly influence New Zealand's batting performance.'Mystery spinner' Varun Chakravarthy has emerged as the biggest match-winner for India in the tournament. Introduced late in the playing XI, Varun made an immediate impact with a five-wicket haul against New Zealand, baffling the batters with his variations.Only one Kiwi batter countered Varun's variations effectively and that was Kane Williamson, who scored 81 in that match. Williamson's excellent technique against spin makes this duel a focal point of the match.New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner's left-arm spin has been really effective in the tournament, particularly in the middle overs. His three-wicket haul against South Africa in the semifinal stands out.For India, Shreyas Iyer has been consistency personified. Iyer is notably proficient against left-arm spinners, averaging 97.50 in ODIs. Across six innings, Santner has bowled 93 deliveries to Iyer without dismissing him and conceding 78 runs.Mohammed Shami has played an instrumental role in India's bowling attack, delivering crucial breakthroughs with the new ball throughout the tournament. Shami has dismissed New Zealand opener Rachin Ravindra twice in ODIs across three innings.Shami is particularly effective against left-handed batters. He averages 27.98 from 101 innings with 62 dismissals to his name against the lefties.

Pranav's final push for glory

Exclusive | Arjuna Awardee Vantika Agrawal: 'People still ask, 'Chess is fine, but what do you really do?''

NEW DELHI: The soft thud of a yellow smiley-face sponge ball striking the floor again and again barely disturbed the silence of a five-star hotel room, where 18-year-old Pranav Venkatesh and his coach, GM Shyam Sundar M, were putting up during the Chennai Masters in November last year.Standing tall with a table tennis racquet — now a makeshift cricket bat — Pranav had already transformed his room into the quietest battleground ever. And if there was no sponge ball or table tennis racquet? No problem! The student-teacher duo would improvise, turning a bottle cap into a ball and the bottle into a bat, maximising the use of their limited resources.It is a familiar sight of Pranav staying with his mentor before a major tournament.It is unconventional, but it works. Cricket, often seen by the mentor as a break from the mental grind, has become part of Pranav’s preparation routine for chess.""Cricket, badminton, any sport... we play it all in the room,"" Shyam, who couldn’t travel to Montenegro to witness his student clinch the World Junior Chess Championship title due to visa issues, toldduring an exclusive conversation.Pranav’s journey to becoming the junior world chess champion, interestingly, began on a cricket field a year ago.Shyam, who runs his chess academy, Chess Thulir , in Chennai near Perambur, often plays cricket with his students to bond with them and keep them physically active.""Pranav came to play cricket a few times, just like any other teenager,"" Shyam recalled with a chuckle. ""Back then, he wasn’t even training for chess with me.""But that soon changed.Though he had trained with other coaches in the past, it was only after his father approached Shyam that their serious chess journey began.""We started working together officially around January last year,"" Shyam noted. ""By then, Pranav was already a grandmaster. But my goal was to take him to the next level.""Thus began a year of intense training, where Shyam sought to balance Pranav’s natural skill in fast-paced formats like rapid and blitz with the endurance needed for longer, more gruelling classical games.""It’s like T20 cricket versus Test cricket,"" Shyam explained. ""You can hit the ball out of the park in T20, but in Test cricket, you need patience to play the long game. Similarly, in chess, Pranav was brilliant at quick formats, but I wanted him to master the longer formats too.""Pranav, already recognised for his acumen in blitz games — having even defeated top players like Magnus Carlsen in online matches — had to channel his instinct for speed into a more methodical approach.However, the transition wasn’t easy.""Initially, it took some time. We worked together for two months, and then he went to Spain to play a few events. It didn’t go well, which was expected because I need time to understand any player I work with. The first few months are always a process of trial and error — getting to know their psychology and approach. So, the first two or three months didn’t go very well,"" Shyam told. ""Once I started to know him much better, it went very well. He was winning events like the Dubai Police Championship and Sharjah Masters.""These victories, though impressive, were just the beginning.By December 2024, Pranav had qualified for the prestigious Chennai Masters Tournament after winning the Chennai Challenges Invitational.It was at this event that the coach-player duo cemented their unique pre-match routine, which included playing cricket in hotel rooms to relax before a match.“We used to play cricket in the room with a bottle cap, stress balls, whatever was available,” Shyam said, laughing. “The idea was to keep Pranav relaxed.”READ ALSO: 'A big step forward for women': World No. 8 Anna Muzychuk on equal prize in Norway Chess | Exclusive Pranav, a boy of few words, has remained humble throughout this period. With no presence on social media, he is managed well by his father, Venkatesh, who often travels with him to different countries for tournaments.Shyam, being a grandmaster himself, was not unaware that the pressure was mounting on Pranav, especially as he prepared for his ultimate challenge: the 2025 World Junior U20 Chess Championship in Petrovac, Montenegro.As the tournament neared, preparing for the tournament was getting tricky. ""Just before the tournament, we had a few online sessions. Initially, we had planned to play different openings,"" Shyam admitted. ""But it wasn’t just a rigid plan A, B, or C. Plan A didn’t feel quite right, so we adjusted. What was originally Plan B and C became Plan A.""But as the tournament kicked off, Shyam reflected, ""He started strong, and once he took a one-point lead, he maintained it and converted his chances well.""His final-round draw against Matic Lavrencic, securing a score of 9/11, sealed the victory and solidified Pranav’s status as one of the brightest young stars in the chess world.“I spoke to him after the final round,” Shyam recalled, his voice filled with pride. ""He was always confident. He told me, 'Come on, don't you know this is my kind of position? How could I mess this up?'""But for Shyam, the nerves were unavoidable. “During the last round, I was so anxious that I went to the temple. I had to switch off the internet, of course. After coming out, I turned my data back on, and there it was—he messaged, 'I won the tournament.' I just thought, 'Thank God!'”Winning the World Junior Chess Championship — a title previously held by none other than Viswanathan Anand — has been the summit of Pranav's career so far.The journey, however, wasn’t just about winning.It was about the bond built over shared games of cricket, the relentless training, and the mutual respect between coach and student.""We speak the same regional language — Tamil — so we get along very well. We crack jokes, and he's like an innocent kid. He doesn’t have many distractions,"" said the 32-year-old coach. ""It’s a good relationship. He watches a lot of comedy movies, so we use movie references while joking.""As Pranav stood on the podium in Montenegro, a smile on his face, trophy in hand, he looked back — not just at the hours spent hunched over a chessboard, but also at those moments in hotel rooms, where the sound of a bottle cap hitting the wall did little to disturb others.","Pranav Venkatesh, 18, is the junior world chess champion. His coach, GM Shyam Sundar M, often plays cricket with his students to bond with them and keep them physically active. Cricket, often seen by Shyam as a break from the mental grind, has become part of Pranav's preparation routine for chess.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118808711,imgsize-88916,width-400,resizemode-4/118808711.jpg"

Team India, currently in scintillating form, will look to clinch their third ICC Champions Trophy title when they face a determined New Zealand in the final at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.India's previous triumphs came in 2002 and 2013, and this final offers them a chance to settle some old scores against the spunky Kiwis.The clash for the 'mini-World Cup' pits two of the most consistent yet underachieving teams in ICC events against each other. Both sides will be desperate for glory after enduring heartbreaking losses in recent ODI finals - India in the 2017 Champions Trophy and the 2023 World Cup, and New Zealand in the 2015 and 2019 World Cups.This time, India's campaign has also been slightly marred by accusations of ""unfair advantage"" due to all their matches being scheduled at a single venue.A key point of interest will be whether India captain Rohit Sharma uses this stage to bid farewell to his international career, or at least his ODI career, following the example of Australia captain Steve Smith and former Bangladesh skipper Mushfiqur Rahim, who recently retired after their teams' exits.Similarly, New Zealand's Kane Williamson, who has been in fine form with 189 runs in four matches at 47.25, including a century in the semifinal, may also see this as an opportunity to bow out of ODIs in style.Rohit, 37, has been instrumental in setting the tone for India, despite not producing a big individual score. His cameos of 41, 20, 15, and 28 in India's four consecutive wins have earned praise from head coach Gautam Gambhir. ""If your captain bats with such intent, it sends a strong message to the dressing room about being fearless and courageous. We evaluate impact, not just runs,"" Gambhir said.The final also offers Rohit and Virat Kohli , who has found form with an unbeaten century against Pakistan and a crucial 84 against Australia in the semifinal, a chance to relive the glory of India's T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies last year.For India, this match presents an opportunity to avenge a defeat New Zealand inflicted on them nearly 25 years ago. On Oct 15, 2000, Chris Cairns' century guided New Zealand to a four-wicket victory over Sourav Ganguly's India in the Champions Trophy final in Nairobi, securing their maiden title. In recent years, New Zealand have emerged as India's bogey team in ICC events.The Black Caps defeated India in the 2019 World Cup semifinal and the 2021 World Test Championship final. However, India broke the jinx with a 70-run victory in a high-scoring semifinal in Mumbai earlier in this tournament, thanks to centuries from Kohli and Shreyas Iyer , and a seven-wicket haul by Mohammed Shami India's journey to the final has been marked by dominant performances, including a clinical win over Australia in the semifinal and victories in all three group matches against Bangladesh, Pakistan, and New Zealand.Bouncing back from an ordinary Test tour of Australia, vice-captain Shubman Gill has batted like a dream, scoring 157 runs in four matches at 52.33, while Kohli, Iyer and KL Rahul have given the Indian middle order the look of a well-oiled machine, with Hardik Pandya providing the perfect finishing touches.India's decision to field a four-pronged spin attack in their last two matches has paid off handsomely. Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja Kuldeep Yadav , and Varun Chakravarthy have been instrumental, with Chakravarthy's five-wicket haul against New Zealand in the group stage proving decisive.","Team India face New Zealand in the ICC Champions Trophy final in Dubai.

Former world number one Novak Djokovic , who has won the Indian Wells ATP Masters five times, suffered a surprising defeat in his opening match on Saturday, going down to lucky loser Botic van de Zandschulp, while reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz progressed to the next round.The 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic lost 6-2, 3-6, 6-1.""No excuses for a poor performance,"" the Serb said after the match. ""It doesn't feel great when you play this way on the court. But congratulations to my opponent -- just a bad day in the office, I guess, for me.""Van de Zandschulp has established a notable record against the big guns.His impressive victories include a remarkable win against Alcaraz at the US Open in the previous year, followed by a triumph over Rafael Nadal in Davis Cup, which turned out to be the Spanish legend's final professional match.""I think I kept my cool during the whole match,” said van de Zandschulp. ""I know if I go into the match and lose my cool, especially against the big players, it's going to be a really tough day. That's always one thing I'm trying to do well.""Djokovic reduced his unforced errors significantly in the second set, compared to his 14 mistakes in the first set and swiftly secured a service break, establishing a 3-0 advantage.He celebrated with a fist pump after striking a powerful forehand winner to the corner, earning his first break opportunity of the contest.Despite the intense exchanges continuing throughout, Djokovic's visible signs of frustration emerged occasionally. Although he lost his serve while attempting to close out the set, he succeeded in his subsequent service game, delivering a powerful forehand winner to the baseline to make it an even contest.But the momentum shift proved temporary. Zandschulp maintained consistent pressure through both baseline play and net approaches, as Djokovic's error count increased steadily.Zandschulp gained the upper hand with a break for 3-1, subsequently winning five consecutive games as Djokovic struggled to halt his opponent's progress.Djokovic exit followed a similar shock suffered by world number two Alexander Zverev and fourth-seeded Casper Ruud.The tournament's landscape has shifted dramatically, with world number three Alcaraz emerging as the highest-ranked player remaining, particularly notable given world number one Jannik Sinner's absence due to a three-month drugs suspension.Alcaraz, pursuing a remarkable achievement of three consecutive Indian Wells titles - a feat only accomplished by Djokovic and Roger Federer - commenced his title defence impressively, defeating France's Quentin Halys 6-4, 6-2.The Spanish player secured an early advantage to claim the opening set, before establishing a commanding 4-0 lead in the second set with impressive serving.His dominant display included seven aces and successful defence of the sole break point faced, concluding the match efficiently in 67 minutes.""I was nervous at the beginning of the match,"" he told a supportive crowd. ""The first match is never easy so I was trying to be focused on my game.""I just tried to be relaxed, as relaxed as I can. Can always be better, but I'm ready for the (next) round and excited.""Australian Open winner Madison Keys began proceedings at the combined ATP Masters and WTA 1000 tournament, defeating Russia's Anastasia Potapova 6-3, 6-0 in her first appearance since claiming her first Grand Slam title.Her performance was sharp as she overcame Potapova in 63 minutes.In other early contests, American players Taylor Fritz and Coco Gauff progressed to the next round.Fritz, who won the men's title in 2022, beat Italian qualifier Matteo Gigante 7-5, 6-3, while Gauff -- also seeded third in her section -- secured a hard-fought 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7/4) win against Japan's Moyuka Uchijima.","Former world number one Novak Djokovic suffers shock defeat at Indian Wells.

Gautam Gambhir chases history! India coach targets maiden ICC trophy in first final

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has hit back at a social media (X) account user for falsely attributing a quote to him regarding the retirement plans of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma . As Team India gears up for the Champions Trophy 2025 final against New Zealand, scheduled for Sunday, speculation around the future of the two senior stars has been a hot topic.Kohli and Rohit, who already announced their T20I retirements after India's 2024 T20 World Cup triumph, have played a crucial role in India’s unbeaten run in the Champions Trophy. While Kohli has delivered match-winning knocks against Pakistan and Australia, Rohit has provided fiery starts, setting the tone for India’s batting.Amid the buzz, an X user shared a fake quote allegedly from Ashwin’s YouTube channel, stating that Rohit was targeting the 2027 ODI World Cup while Kohli might retire soon to spend more time with his family.

NEW DELHI: India's dominance in world cricket over the past two years, particularly in limited-overs formats, has been nothing short of remarkable. The Rohit Sharma-led side has played in all three major ICC tournament finals in this period, winning two of them and establishing themselves as the most formidable force in international cricket.The juggernaut began with India's incredible run in the 2023 ICC ODI World Cup at home. They remained unbeaten throughout the tournament, winning 10 consecutive matches before stumbling at the final hurdle.Despite a dominant campaign, their title hopes were dashed by Australia in the final, as Travis Head’s magnificent 137 guided the Aussies to a six-wicket victory in a 240-run chase in Ahmedabad. Though the World Cup ended in heartbreak, India’s 10-1 record was a testament to their strength and consistency.Undeterred, India bounced back to end their 11-year ICC title drought with a resounding victory in the 2024 T20 World Cup , hosted in the Americas. They once again went unbeaten in the tournament, culminating in a thrilling seven-run victory over South Africa in the final at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown.The triumph secured India’s second T20 World Cup title, their first since the inaugural edition in 2007 under MS Dhoni. India finished the tournament with an outstanding record of eight wins and one no result, reaffirming their prowess on the world stage.India continued their dominance in 2025 by winning the ICC Champions Trophy , hosted in Pakistan and the UAE. In yet another unbeaten campaign, they secured victories in all three group-stage matches before cruising through the semifinal and the final against New Zealand.Playing all their matches in Dubai due to their decision not to travel to Pakistan in the hybrid model, India finished with a flawless 5-0 record. The final saw them clinch a thrilling four-wicket victory over the Kiwis, breaking a 12-year wait for an ICC ODI title.With this latest triumph, Team India has set an unprecedented benchmark in ICC tournaments. Across the last three major events, India have played 25 matches, winning 23, losing just one, with one game ending in a no result. This level of dominance is rarely seen in international cricket and solidifies India’s status as the team to beat in global tournaments.

NEW DELHI: In a tournament steeped in cricketing glory, few symbols capture triumph quite like the white Champions Trophy jackets .Introduced in the 2009 edition held in South Africa, the jackets have grown into a powerful emblem of elite success — a visual badge of honour for the world’s finest ODI team.While India celebrated their record third Champions Trophy title on Sunday in Dubai with a four-wicket win over New Zealand, what caught fans’ attention during the presentation was not just the trophy lift, but the donning of the white jackets.Rohit Sharma and his squad wore them with pride, adding a regal touch to the celebration.Designed originally by Mumbai-based fashion designer Babita M, the jacket blends rich Italian wool, elegant gold braiding, and the Champions Trophy logo embroidered with a golden contour.It was first unveiled on August 13, 2009, as part of the ICC’s move to lend the tournament a distinct identity, akin to the green jackets of The Masters in golf.Former Pakistan great Wasim Akram reintroduced the ceremonial outfit ahead of the 2025 edition, calling it a “symbol of tactical brilliance and lasting legacy.”He added that the white jacket “builds excitement and honours the journey of those who’ve played the game at the highest level.”This year, India earned their jackets in style — Rohit Sharma's commanding 76, a composed unbeaten 34 from KL Rahul, and a sharp spin show that restricted New Zealand to 251.In cricketing terms, lifting the trophy is the moment. But putting on the white jacket? That’s legacy.

We played some good cricket through the tournament. To have the result our way is a great feeling. (Aggressive style) Not natural to me, but something I really wanted to do. When you are doing something different, you have to have the backing of the team and management. I spoke to Rahul bhai earlier and now Gauti bhai as well. It is something I really wanted to do. I have played all these years in a different style, and now we are getting the results with this.""""We have to understand the nature of the surfaces and I was very clear about how I wanted to execute the first five-six overs. I have gotten out as well earlier, but the execution matters. The depth gives me the freedom and it helps. With Jadeja coming at 8, it gives you the confidence to go hard up front. As long as I am clear in my mind, it is great.""Under Rohit's leadership, India secured their second ICC trophy in two years, following their 2024 T20 World Cup triumph. This victory marked India's third Champions Trophy title, adding to their previous wins in 2002 and 2013.""I appreciate everyone who came to support us. The crowd has been amazing.

NEW DELHI: Shreyas Iyer was left 'over the moon' after playing a crucial 48-run knock to help India lift their third Champions Trophy title with a four-wicket victory over New Zealand in the final in Dubai on Sunday.Iyer finished the tournament as the second-highest run-scorer with 241 runs in five matches, behind New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra. This triumph marked the right-hander’s first-ever ICC title, making it an unforgettable moment in his career.""I am over the moon, to be honest. It’s hard to sum it up in words. This is my first ICC trophy, and I feel overwhelmed. Kudos to everyone in the dressing room—the way we turned up in this tournament was simply magnificent,"" Iyer said.He also expressed his love for performing under pressure. “I thrive under pressure and love the challenge. I always want to score big, but even a small contribution that helps the team win is enough for me. I am truly happy.”While Iyer’s 48 off 62 balls played a vital role, it was KL Rahul ’s composed 34 off 33 balls* that guided India across the finish line.With this victory, India secured their third Champions Trophy title after 2002 and 2013 and their second ICC trophy in 12 months, following their T20 World Cup triumph in June last year.India’s latest win makes them the most successful team in Champions Trophy history. The packed Dubai stadium, filled with Indian supporters, witnessed a moment of redemption after the heartbreak of the 2023 ODI World Cup final on home soil.Rahul admitted to feeling immense pressure in the final moments but backed himself to stay calm.“I don’t think I can say this on camera, but I was shitting myself. We had a couple of batters left, but I was tense. It’s all about staying composed in situations like this. I’ve batted under pressure in three out of five games in this tournament, and in one, I didn’t even get to bat against Pakistan.”Reflecting on India’s resilience, Rahul credited the BCCI and domestic cricket structure for preparing players for high-pressure moments.“Handling pressure is something we’ve learned since picking up a bat and choosing to become professional cricketers. The way BCCI and the domestic circuit groom us helps us excel in situations like these.”India’s triumph not only sealed their dominance in the Champions Trophy but also reaffirmed their ability to thrive under pressure on the world stage.",India beat New Zealand by four wickets to win the Champions Trophy.

NEW DELHI: India ended their 12-year ICC ODI title drought in style, defeating New Zealand by four wickets to claim their record-breaking third ICC Champions Trophy title on Sunday at the Dubai International Stadium. Star batter Virat Kohli , reflecting on the victory, praised the team’s depth and asserted that this squad has the potential to dominate world cricket for the next eight years.""When you leave, you want to leave the team in a better place,"" Kohli said. ""I feel we've got a squad that’s ready to take on the world for the next eight years. Shubman has been outstanding, Shreyas has played some top knocks, KL has finished games, and Hardik has been superb with the bat.""India, unbeaten throughout the eight-nation tournament held in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, chased down New Zealand’s 252-run target with an over to spare. Skipper Rohit Sharma led from the front, scoring a crucial 76 off 83 balls, and forming a steady 105-run opening partnership with Shubman Gill (31). However, New Zealand’s spin trio of Mitchell Santner (2/46), Michael Bracewell (2/28), and Rachin Ravindra (1/47) brought their side back into contention by reducing India to 203/5.Despite the setbacks, KL Rahul (34), Hardik Pandya (18), and Ravindra Jadeja, who struck the winning boundary, ensured India’s triumph. With this victory, India surpassed Australia’s two-title record, having previously won the Champions Trophy in 2002 and 2013.Reflecting on the victory, Kohli remarked, ""It's been amazing. We wanted to bounce back after a tough Australian tour, and winning a big tournament like the Champions Trophy is incredible. There’s so much talent in the dressing room; they’re always striving to take their game further. We seniors are just happy to share our experiences, and that’s what makes this Indian team so strong.""India’s bowlers had earlier set the foundation for the win, with Varun Chakaravarthy (2/45) and Kuldeep Yadav (2/40) restricting New Zealand to 251/7. Daryl Mitchell (63 off 101) and Bracewell (53 off 40) were the key contributors for the Kiwis, but India's disciplined bowling attack never allowed them to break free.Kohli also lauded New Zealand’s performance and their ability to consistently punch above their weight. ""They’re an amazing team. We’ve always been in awe of what they can do despite having a smaller talent pool. They execute their plans so well, and their fielding unit is easily the best in the world. It’s sad to see my good friend Kane Williamson on the losing side, but New Zealand keeps playing cricket that makes them one of the most competitive teams.""With this triumph, Team India now boasts an impressive ICC trophy cabinet, which includes two ODI World Cups, two T20 World Cups, and three Champions Trophy titles.

and records galore

KOLKATA: It was an evening Mohun Bagan Super Giant made their own with a sense of inevitability. A record run at home, record points tally and winning the biggest prize in Indian club football in back-to-back seasons - Jose Molina 's brigade brought quite something to the party on Saturday.They celebrated their Indian Super League Shield-winning show in grand style, defeating second-placed FC Goa 2-0 at the Salt Lake Stadium here and finishing their group stage with a slice of revenge against the visitors.FC Goa - supervised by India head coach Manuel Manolo - came into the match as the only other team after Bengaluru FC to have been able to conquer Molina's brigade this season. But they lost the plot in the reverse fixture, conceding two goals born out of individual blunders.On the first occasion, Boris Singh much to everyone's horror saw his back-pass with a header off an ambitious but misdirected long ball from Bagan defender Tom Aldred roll into an empty net with the Goa goalkeeper Hrithik Tiwari also leaving his place with the intention of claiming it in the 63rd minute.As if that dreadful defensive miscommunication was not enough, Bagan became the beneficiary of another clanger deep into the stoppage time. This time, India's defensive mainstay Sandesh Jhingan messed up big time in controlling the ball under pressure from Jason Cummings and Greg Stewart pounced on it to beat the goalkeeper with consummate ease.Mohun Bagan finished the league stage with the highest number of points (56), record number of wins in a ISL season (17) and an unbeaten run at home (11 wins and one draw). Goa's late chase for the Shield fell eight-point short.Long before the kick-off, thousands of Bagan fans made it an occasion to remember. They unfurled tifos highlighting the team's legacy and supremacy; they carried out Mexican waves and turned on the flashlight on their mobile phones to set light to the team's ambitions.Despite having clinched the Shield with two games to spare, Molina opted for a strong side giving only goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh his first game. It's, however, Goa who scored in all their matches in the group stage before Saturday and came close to scoring early on, Iker Guarrotxena missing the target by a whisker while Udanta Singh seeing his goal-bound attempt blocked by Aldred.However, the highlight of the first half came in the injury time when Manvir Singh did find the back of the net but Goa vehemently protested and referee Rahul Kumar Gupta eventually disallowed it after consultation with fourth official Harish Kundu, judging that Dimitri Petratos had touched the ball with his hand in the build-up of the move.Goa got a reprieve. But then came two individual mistakes, leading to their downfall in an uncharacteristic way.Bagan were already into the party mood. They brought the house down with another win; they rang the curtain down on the league stage by breaking new ground.",Mohun Bagan beat FC Goa 2-0 to win Indian Super League Shield. Bagan finished the league stage with the highest number of points (56) and record number of wins in a ISL season (17) Goa's late chase for the Shield fell eight-point short.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118813437,imgsize-150296,width-400,resizemode-4/118813437.jpg"

Inter Milan extended their lead over Napoli at top of Serie A to four points after they were made to work hard at home by Monza before winning 3-2 on Saturday.Despite being heavily favoured against last-placed Monza with only 14 points this season, Inte found themselves trailing by two goals in the opening half.Marko Arnautovic scored just before half-time to narrow the gap, and while Inter dominated possession afterwards, they didn't level the score until the 64th minute, when Hakan Calhanoglu made it even.The winning goal came in the 77th minute when Lautaro Martinez's header took a slight deflection off Monza's Greek defender Giorgos Kyriakopoulos before finding the net.Despite their struggles, Inter's victory increased pressure on Napoli, who have managed just one point from their previous five matches ahead of their clash with seventh-ranked Fiorentina.Meanwhile, AC Milan faced a challenging away match against struggling Lecce, mirroring a similar situation to their city rivals. American forward Christian Pulisic netted twice, helping his team secure a vital 3-2 victory and avoid a fourth consecutive Serie A loss.Without their suspended French keeper Mike Maignan, Sergio Conceicao's team found themselves trailing 2-0, as Lecce's Montenegrin striker Nikola Krstovic scored twice.The tide turned when Antonino Gallo's own goal in the 68th minute gave Milan hope, followed by Pulisic converting a penalty five minutes afterwards.","Inter Milan extended their lead over Napoli to four points with a 3-2 win over Monza.

League leaders Liverpool secured a 3-1 victory against bottom-placed Southampton, with Mohamed Salah converting two penalties, while Nottingham Forest achieved a significant 1-0 triumph over Manchester City to boost their Champions League aspirations.Liverpool extended their advantage at the summit to 16 points, despite an underwhelming first-half display. Following their successful 1-0 Champions League win against Paris Saint-Germain, Liverpool manager Arne Slot selected three different players but was forced to make three substitutions at half-time to revitalise his team.Despite Southampton amassing merely nine points from 28 fixtures this season, they surprised Anfield when Will Smallbone scored just before the break. A miscommunication between Alisson Becker and Virgil van Dijk allowed Smallbone to tap into an empty net.Slot responded by introducing Harvey Elliott, Alexis MacAllister, and Andy Robertson after the interval, which resulted in two goals within three minutes before the hour mark. Darwin Nunez equalised with a well-taken finish from Luis Diaz’s delivery, before Salah converted a penalty after Nunez was fouled in the box. The Egyptian striker sealed the win with another spot-kick two minutes before full-time, bringing his season’s goal tally to 32.Arsenal, in second place, have two matches in hand over the leaders, starting with Sunday’s away fixture at Manchester United. Liverpool appear destined to secure their second league championship in 35 years.Elsewhere, Nottingham Forest opened a four-point gap over third-placed City after Callum Hudson-Odoi’s late winner at the City Ground. The former Chelsea winger beat Ederson with seven minutes remaining, courtesy of Morgan Gibbs-White’s assist, sparking celebrations as Forest defeated the English champions for the first time since 1997.The two-time European champions have not played in the continent’s elite club competition since 1980 but are edging closer to qualification. A top-five finish may be enough due to English teams’ strong European performances this season.City remain in fourth place, vulnerable after suffering their ninth league defeat of the campaign. Pep Guardiola’s side now face the prospect of being overtaken by Chelsea, who host struggling Leicester on Sunday.Crystal Palace overcame Jean-Philippe Mateta’s serious ear injury to defeat Ipswich 1-0, courtesy of Ismaila Sarr’s strike. Palace have now won nine of their last eleven matches across all competitions, climbing to eleventh place.Brighton also enhanced their Champions League prospects as Joao Pedro’s dramatic 98th-minute penalty secured a 2-1 win against Fulham. Raul Jimenez ’s superb opener had given Fulham the lead before Jean Paul van Hecke equalised before half-time.

Nottingham Forest dealt a major blow to Manchester City's Champions League hopes as Callum Hudson-Odoi struck late to secure a 1-0 victory in Saturday’s top-four clash at the City Ground.City’s uncharacteristically poor Premier League season continues, with this being their ninth league defeat, leaving their usual top-four finish in serious doubt. Despite six league titles in seven years, Pep Guardiola’s side finds itself in an unfamiliar battle to secure a Champions League spot.This was City’s first league defeat to Forest since 1997, putting them in a precarious position with just a one-point lead over Chelsea, who could leapfrog them with a win against Leicester on Sunday. A fifth-place finish might still be enough for Champions League qualification , but that depends on English clubs' performances in European competitions this season.Meanwhile, Forest’s remarkable transformation from last season’s relegation fight continued, as they climbed to third place, maintaining a four-point cushion over City. The two-time European champions are now edging closer to their first Champions League qualification since 1980-81.The match began with an emotional tribute to Stuart Pearce, who was hospitalised after falling ill on a flight. Forest honoured their former defender with a ""Get Well Soon Stuart"" message displayed on the big screen after three minutes.A cagey first half saw few clear-cut chances, with Nico Gonzalez narrowly missing from distance, and Josko Gvardiol setting up Phil Foden, only for Nicolas Dominguez to block his shot. Bernardo Silva then wasted an opportunity, failing to spot an unmarked Erling Haaland.Jeremy Doku forced Matz Sels into his first real save, while Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White failed to hit the target with a speculative effort. After the break, Anthony Elanga’s cross found Dominguez, whose volley forced Ederson into action.Guardiola responded by introducing Omar Marmoush, Kevin De Bruyne, Rico Lewis, and Mateo Kovacic in an attempt to break the deadlock, but the changes had little impact as Forest grew in confidence.City had a scare when Hudson-Odoi’s curling effort was brilliantly tipped onto the post by Ederson. De Bruyne’s free-kick was then comfortably saved by Sels before Hudson-Odoi finally broke through in the 83rd minute.Gibbs-White delivered a perfectly weighted pass, allowing Hudson-Odoi to cut inside and smash a powerful strike past Ederson’s weak near-post save, sparking wild celebrations at the City Ground.",Nottingham Forest beat Manchester City 1-0 at the City Ground. Callum Hudson- Odoi scored the only goal of the game in the 83rd minute. City's Champions League hopes are now in serious doubt. The defeat was City's first in the Premier League since 1997.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118806843,imgsize-52562,width-400,resizemode-4/118806843.jpg"

PANAJI: India’s India’s record goal scorer Sunil Chhetri has been coaxed to come out of retirement and join the national team for the crucial final round of the AFC Asian Cup 2027 qualifiers.The 40-year-old Chhetri was included among the 26 probables for the international friendly against Maldives on March 19 and the Group C opener of the Asian Cup qualifiers against Bangladesh on March 25 in Shillong. India, without a win in the whole of 2024, have been clubbed with Bangladesh, Hong Kong and Singapore with only the top team making it to the continental showpiece in Saudi Arabia.“The qualification for the Asian Cup is very crucial for us. Given the importance of the tournament and the matches ahead, I discussed with Sunil Chhetri about making a comeback to strengthen the national team. He agreed, and so we have included him in the squad,” India coach Manolo Marquez said on Thursday.The striker had not made any official statement on this development till late Thursday.BFC however put out a cryptic “Maybe all goodbyes are just an ‘I’ll see you soon’ in disguise,” on their official X handle.“Sunil’s leadership qualities are unmatched. He has played international football for close to two decades and a player of his stature can motivate the entire team. His form too has been impeccable in the ISL, scoring 12 goals. India can greatly benefit with a striker like him in the team,” said All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Kalyan Chaubey.Chhetri is India’s highest-ever goalscorer and was third among the world’s active players, behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, when he called time on his international career in May last year.Since then, he has continued to star for Bengaluru FC and has scored goals in the Indian Super League (ISL). This season he has scored 12 goals in the ISL, second only to the Moroccan Alaaeddine Ajaraie who tops the list with a record 21 for NorthEast United.Other Indian strikers have not really delivered, prompting Marquez to fall back on the services of the veteran striker. Marquez, who also coaches FC Goa, took over the national team after Chhetri’s international retirement and will have him in the dressing room for the first time. In his first assignment — the Inter -Continental Cup — Marquez tried young Kiyan Nassiri, Edmund Lalrindika, Manvir Singh and Liston Colaco upfront without much success.India drew goalless against Mauritius and lost 0-3 to Syria. India did score in the next two friendlies against Vietnam and Malaysia, both ending 1-1, through Farukh Chaudhary and Rahul Bheke. The only bright spark for Marquez and Indian football this season has been the rise of Brison Fernandes, with the Goa winger’s seven goals bracketing him among the top-10 strikers in the ISL.He could provide the surprise element on the wings for the national team, if declared fit. The other big call in the national team probable list is the exclusion of goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu. The first name on the starting list for several years, Gurpreet’s form for BFC this season has been inconsistent and marked by errors.He lost his place in the team for two games to Lalthuammawia Ralte but has since made a comeback. ISL Golden Glove contender Vishal Kaith (Mohun Bagan), Amrinder Singh (Odisha) and Gurmeet Singh (NorthEast) are the three goalkeepers in Marquez’s list.","India's record goal scorer Sunil Chhetri has been coaxed to come out of retirement and join the national team.

Chelsea advanced towards the UEFA Conference League quarter-finals with a 2-1 victory at Copenhagen on Thursday in their last 16 tie's first leg, whilst Panathinaikos and Fiorentina engaged in an intense five-goal contest.The visitors secured their advantage through second-half goals from Reece James and Enzo Fernandez, before Gabriel Pereira reduced the margin for the home side, as Enzo Maresca's team secured a narrow advantage in Denmark's capital.After a lacklustre first half, Chelsea captain James opened the scoring moments after the interval, receiving Marc Cucurella's deep pass before placing a long-range shot inside the near post.The match intensified following the goal, with Copenhagen nearly equalising immediately when Viktor Claesson's one-on-one attempt struck the inside of Robert Sanchez's post before rebounding into the keeper's hands.Substitute Fernandez secured a second goal for the visitors in the 65th minute, finishing decisively after impressive build-up play from young Tyrique George.The Premier League club appeared in control until Pereira found space in the penalty area to head in from a set-piece with 11 minutes remaining.Also, Panathinaikos secured a 3-2 victory against previous season's runners-up Fiorentina.Panathinaikos established an early dominance with Karol Swiderski and Nemanja Maksimovic scoring within the first 19 minutes, creating a 2-0 advantage.

So I need to figure that out first.""Zverev admitted he had no clear explanation for his dip in form since the Australian Open.Before the tournament, he had cited illness during two of the three weeks of his ""rough South American swing"" as a possible factor.However, after his 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/4) loss to 43rd-ranked Griekspoor—who had been defeated in six of their previous seven meetings—Zverev conceded that he was simply not playing well enough.""I'm not playing a level that I want to play, definitely not playing anywhere near what I played in Australia,"" he said.After taking the first set against Griekspoor, Zverev staged a comeback from 2-5 down in the second to lead 6-5, only to be broken while serving for the match.In the third set, he saved five match points in the 12th game and converted his fifth break point to push the contest into a decisive tiebreak. However, he could not hold off Griekspoor any longer, ultimately falling short.""He played a good match,"" Zverev said. ""There's no question about that. But I have to look at myself a little bit.""""It's everything,"" he said. ""I keep working, but right now it's not clicking.""",World No. 2 Alexander Zverev loses to Tallon Griekspoor in the first round of the Indian Wells Masters. He is the first men's top seed to lose in the opening round since Andy Murray in 2017. The German admits he is not playing at a level he wants to play.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118797150,imgsize-26982,width-400,resizemode-4/118797150.jpg"

Brazilian rising star Joao Fonseca demonstrated resilience by overcoming a third-set deficit to defeat British player Jacob Fearnley 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 on Thursday at Indian Wells .The teenager, who earned his place in history as the 10th-youngest ATP Tour winner with his victory at the Argentina Open in February, said: ""Today was petty difficult, a lot of windy, but I got through. Beginning of the match I played really well and he was making some mistakes. But the second set he played more aggressive and I was a bit more tight, maybe a bit more nervous.""Fearnley seemed to gain the upper hand after breaking Fonseca's serve in the third set's third game, and subsequently held his serve for a 3-1 lead in a lengthy game that reached deuce on five occasions.However, Fonseca responded by claiming the following five games in succession, securing two service breaks and finishing the competitive match between the world's 80th and 81st-ranked competitors with a decisive backhand volley winner.In the women's opening round, Olympic champion Belinda Bencic from Switzerland secured a straightforward victory against Germany's Tatjana Maria, winning 6-1, 6-1 in a swift 65-minute match.The Abu Dhabi champion from February 2024, Bencic, who welcomed her daughter Bella in April 2023, has made an impressive return to competitive tennis following her maternity break.The 27-year-old Swiss player, who has exceeded expectations in her return to the sport, acknowledged that managing the playing conditions was crucial to her success in the match.""Obviously today the main topic was the wind, trying to accept it and not trying to make it pretty -- just staying in the rallies, trying to be more smart rather than playing amazing shots.""Japanese tennis player and Indian Wells debutant Moyuka Uchijima delivered a commanding performance to defeat former US Open champion Emma Raducanu with a score of 6-3, 6-2.The victory earned Uchijima a second-round clash against world number three Coco Gauff.","Joao Fonseca defeats British player Jacob Fearnley 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 at Indian Wells.

'The next big thing' in Indian tennis blooming under Rafael Nadal's watchful eyes: Maaya Rajeshwaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/exclusive-the-next-big-thing-in-indian-tennis-blooming-under-rafael-nadals-watchful-eyes-maaya-rajeshwaran/articleshow/118757183.cms,"(Instagram Photo)

NEW DELHI: ""Learning, enjoying, and sharing time and experiences with these young and talented players,"" Rafael Nadal penned a post on X (formerly Twitter) not even a fortnight ago. The post featured an image of the tennis great at the center. To his left stood three teenage girls, and to his right, four more. On his far right, one could spot 15-year-old Maaya in her training attire, looking somewhat nervous, her right index finger tucked into her left fist.Nervousness was quite palpable - after all, the 22-time Grand Slam champion was right there in person at his Rafa Nadal Academy on the island of Mallorca, his watchful, forever-fiery eyes evaluating the teens.As for Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi , this was her first meetup with the ""King of Clay"" after taking the tennis scene by storm with her exceptional performance at the Mumbai Open earlier this year.But here's a fun fact: Mumbai wasn't even on her calendar at the start of the year.""First of all, playing the Mumbai Open wasn't even part of the plan. My wildcard was confirmed just 2 days before the tournament,"" Maaya, born to father Rajeshwaran and mother Revathi in a Tamil family, told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive chat. ""I was very confident that I'd compete well. Honestly, I didn't expect that I'd make it that far, but I just played match by match and gave my best.""Romping past opponents far more experienced than her, the rising star made waves across the tennis fraternity.As she reached the semi-finals at the Cricket Club of India and became the first 2009-born player to make semi-final of a WTA 125 event, some even clasped their hands in prayer, hoping for an outlandish title win. But a defeat to 27-year-old Jil Teichmann in the semis brought Maaya's dream run to an end.""After losing in the semi-finals, I was a bit upset because I didn't play as well as I hoped I would. But I had a lot of positives to take away from the Mumbai Open,"" added the rising star following the best series of results in her professional circuit so far.Even tennis was not part of Maaya's plan until she turned eight. For her, it was initially just a ""recreational sport"" after school.She decided to go pro when she was 10. At the heart of her journey are her parents, who, in Maaya's words, have been incredibly supportive.""I'm so blessed that my mom can travel with me. My home has always been my family, and also, I have a very good support system back home. Sometimes, I do miss them a lot,"" she told TimesofIndia.com. ""But specifically, I miss my dad so much. I'm very close to both my parents. I think if my dad would also be with me, I would feel very much like home.""At such a young age, staying abroad can make anyone homesick. Yet, this is exactly what Maaya had always wanted. She recalled, ""We were looking for a base in Europe last year, and the invitation from the Rafa Nadal Academy was quite surprising. But we were very happy that they took me in.""An avid reader and movie buff, Maaya also loves baking - baking, as she bakes, those chants already labelling her as the ""next big thing"" in Indian tennis. ""I'm definitely not worried about that. In fact, it's very supportive and encouraging to see people believe in me,"" she added.Currently, she is more into wading through the pages of the novel ""The Palace of Illusions"" by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni as Maya reflected, ""If I could tell something to my younger self now, it would be to trust myself and the good people around me, no matter what happened, no matter if I didn't win, I just had to do what I love to do with all my heart.""You've probably heard these sayings: A life without a goal is like a ship without a rudder, a car without a steering wheel... or, for tennis fans, Rafael Nadal without a Grand Slam (not quite a famous one yet), but you get the idea.What is it that always drives Maaya?""The ultimate goal for me is to become the world no. 1 and win slams,"" sighed the current world no. 1 Aryna Sabalenka's aficionado.","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi, 15, is the first 2009-born player to make semi-final of a WTA 125 event.

Naomi Osaka was bundled out of the first round at Indian Wells on Wednesday, falling 6-4, 6-4 to Camila Osorio in the Japanese star's first tournament since injury forced her out of the Australian Open.Former world number one Osaka, now ranked 56th in the world, looked rusty against the 52nd-ranked Colombian, struggling to find the range on her powerful groundstrokes on a chilly night in the California desert.Osorio, who challenged Osaka with an array of drop shots and slices, gained the lone break of the opening set for a 5-4 lead and served it out without a hitch, then broke Osaka to open the second.The Japanese star immediately broke back, but Osorio gained the upper hand with a break in the seventh game. After Osaka fought off a match point against her own serve Osorio served it out, fighting off four break points to seal it with a stinging forehand winner.It was a winning return from injury for Osorio, who pulled out of last week's event in Merida, Mexico, with an abdominal injury.Osaka, who returned from a 15-month break last year after giving birth to daughter Shai in 2023, reached her first final since 2022 in Auckland, but retired from the title match with an abdominal injury.Back for the Australian Open, she was forced to retire from her third round match with an abdominal strain.Osorio, owner of two WTA titles, booked a second-round meeting with Denmark's Clara Tauson, the 22nd seed, who took the title in Auckland when Osaka retired.Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, on the comeback trail seven months after giving birth to her son Petr, also fell in the first round.France's 70th-ranked Varvara Gracheva beat the Czech 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, but the 24-year-old was full of admiration for her 34-year-old opponent, who lifted the trophy at Wimbledon in 2011 and 2014.""If you let me step back a little bit, I really want to congratulate her,"" Gracheva said. ""Because she had a child quite recently, and I'm so happy that she now has the role of a mother and a tennis player, which is very demanding. It's very inspiring for sports, athletes, women -- it's just amazing.""All 32 men's and women's seeds have first round byes in this combined ATP Masters and WTA 1000 tournament.Gracheva lined up a second-round meeting with ninth-seeded Mirra Andreeva, the 17-year-old Russian who became the youngest ever WTA 1000 champion in Dubai last month.In other matches, French veteran Caroline Garcia beat US wild card Bernarda Pera 6-3, 6-4 to line up a second-round meeting with second-seeded defending champion Iga Swiatek.- Nishikori battles through -In men's action, Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands beat Miomir Kecmanovic of Serbia 6-7 (5/7), 6-4, 6-3 to book a second-round meeting with top-seeded German Alexander Zverev, who heads a field missing world number one Jannik Sinner as he serves a three-months drugs ban.China's Bu Yunchaokete defeated American Nishesh Basavareddy 7-5, 6-4 to book a second-round match against Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev, runner-up the past two years to Carlos Alcaraz -- who is seeded second as he chases a rare three-peat.Japanese veteran Kei Nishikori, who revealed during the Australian Open that he almost quit tennis last year after lengthy battles with injury, defeated Spain's Jaume Munar 6-2, 5-7, 7-6 (7/3) to line up a second-round match against 18th-seeded Ugo Humbert of France.Nishikori was treated for a leg injury in the third set and then soldiered through cramp to close out the victory.""It was not easy,"" Nishikori said. ""In the third set I was cramping pretty badly, but somehow I came back and won, so a very good match.""bb/rcw",Camila Osorio beats Naomi Osaka in first round of Indian Wells.

Emma Raducanu revealed she experienced severe emotional distress, unable to see clearly or breathe properly when she noticed a man who was intensely focused on her during a match.The British tennis star, who won the 2021 US Open, became upset during her match at the Dubai Championships last month due to the presence of this individual in the stands.The spectator, who had previously approached Raducanu during the tournament, was removed from the venue after she alerted the chair umpire during her second-round match against Karolina Muchova .Dubai police subsequently detained the individual, who signed an agreement to maintain distance from Raducanu. The WTA confirmed the person displayed obsessive behaviour.Speaking to British journalists at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, her first competition since the event, Raducanu described her distress.""I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, I don't know how I'm going to finish'. I literally couldn't see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe. I was like, I need to just take a breather here'.""Despite continuing after the individual's removal, Raducanu lost 7-6 6-4.She explained that her post-match emotional response wasn't primarily due to the defeat.Speaking to the BBC, Raducanu acknowledged that while the situation could have been handled more effectively, security measures have been enhanced.""I'm always now very aware and not necessarily doing things on my own any more. I'm always with someone and always being watched,"" Raducanu told the BBC.Previously in 2022, authorities issued a restraining order against an obsessive supporter who visited her residence three times.Raducanu is scheduled to compete against Japan's Moyuka Uchijima, ranked 52nd globally, three positions above her, in Thursday's first round in California. The victor will face third-seeded Coco Gauff , as the top 32 players receive automatic advancement to round two.","Emma Raducanu reveals she experienced severe emotional distress when she noticed a man who was intensely focused on her during a match.

WTA Merida Open

Mérida:

World number four Jessica Pegula powered to her first WTA title of 2025 on Sunday, beating McCartney Kessler 7-5, 6-2 in an all-American final in Austin, Texas.Pegula, the top seed, claimed a seventh WTA title and her first since she won the 1000 event in Toronto last year.That was one of Pegula's two titles in a 2024 campaign in which she also reached the US Open final.In Kessler she stopped a fast-rising talent, whose first two WTA finals had yielded a pair of titles -- in Cleveland last August and at Hobart in January.The 25-year-old arrived in Austin riding high after claiming her first career top-10 player with an upset of Coco Gauff in the second round at Dubai.But she couldn't find a way past Pegula, who snapped a three-match losing streak in finals for a confidence-building crown heading into the prestigious hard court tournaments at Indian Wells and Miami.Pegula, the only top-10 player in the draw, dropped just one set all week.Kessler looked set to change that when she rallied from 0-2 down to take a 4-2 lead in the first set.But too many unforced errors from Kessler allowed Pegula to get back in front and after Kessler missed a chance to break in the 11th game she was broken in the next as Pegula pocketed the first set.Kessler broke Pegula to open the second, but Pegula won the next four games to seize control.Top-seeded American Emma Navarro capped a dominant week with a 6-0, 6-0 thrashing of qualifier Emiliana Arango in the final of the WTA Merida Open on Sunday.Navarro, seeded No. 1 for the first time, marched to her second WTA title without dropping a set, adding the 500-level crown to the title she won in Hobart last year.Navarro hadn't reached a final since, although she made it to the quarter-finals or better at the last three Grand Slams and came into the week ranked 10th in the world.She needed just 55 minutes to subdue Arango, becoming the first player to win a WTA final 6-0, 6-0 since Iga Swiatek blanked Karolina Pliskova in the 2021 Rome title match.Arango, a 24-year-old Colombian who made it past the quarter-finals of a WTA tournament for the first time this week, came into the tournament ranked 133rd in the world and will crack the top 100 when the new rankings are announced on Monday.","Jessica Pegula wins WTA title in Austin, Texas.

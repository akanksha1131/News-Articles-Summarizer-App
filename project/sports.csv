#IPL Retentions: Why No Shreyas Iyer in KKR Doesn't Come As a Surprise

'Perfect spot for me'

The speculations around Rohit Sharma's future with Mumbai Indians ended on Thursday when the five-time champions retained him as one of their five retentions ahead of the mega auction later this month.Hardik Pandya, Suryakumar Yadav, Rohit, Jasprit Bumrah and Tilak Varma are the five capped players retained by MI.Speaking about the road ahead for MI after a disastrous last-place finish in the 2024 season, when Hardik replaced Rohit as the team's captain, the batting icon hoped that they would manage to put a good squad together at the auction and vowed to turn things around in the 2025 edition.""With Mumbai, we have always tried maintaining a core group of players. Moving forward, I just feel that we can have a good auction and create a group of players who can be match-winners for us. We will put the right foot forward and bring the legacy back where it belongs,"" said Rohit.""I have played so much cricket for Mumbai Indians. I am happy to be here. We haven't had the best of the season in the last two or three years. But we are quite determined to change that. We will be looking forward to each other's help. And hopefully, we can turn things around,"" he added.The MI owners are left with a purse of Rs 45 crore for the auction after paying their five retained players.Bumrah has been retained for Rs 18 crore, Surya for Rs 16.35 crore, Hardik for Rs 16.35 crore, Rohit for Rs 16.30 crore and Tilak Varma for Rs 8 crore.The national team's skipper, who retired from T20Is after the T20 World Cup triumph in June this year, said the players who have represented the country should be preferred when it comes to retention by IPL franchises.""The players who are representing the national team at the highest level should get the preference. It's a very tough one when you come into a fresh auction and you start retaining players,"" said Rohit.The 37-year-old Rohit said having retired from the international arena in the shortest format, nothing could have been better for him than staying with a franchise where he has spent the most time in his IPL career.""Mumbai Indians have a rich history of winning trophies, winning games out of unbelievable situations. Since I have retired from the (international) format, I think this is the perfect spot for me,"" said the former MI captain.",Mumbai Indians retain Rohit Sharma as one of their five retentions.

How does it feel to be Lucknow Super Giants' top retention?

LSG will need a captain this time. Are you putting your hand up?

You relinquished West Indies captaincy. Was there any pressure on you as a batter?

BREAKING NEWS: #IPL 2025 Final Retentions

Now do you think you are mature enough to handle batting and captaincy together?

In the last season, LSG did not have a very good tournament. Anything that you would want to do differently this time?

KOLKATA: Nicholas Pooran has taken some giant strides as a batter in the past couple of years. Quite a bit of the Trinidadian's success has come in the IPL , as a key member of Lucknow Super Giants . So, when LSG marked the former West Indies captain as their number one retention before the mega auction, it did not come as a surprise. In fact, co-owner Shashwat Goenka emphasises that Pooran's retention was never in doubt. ""He is among the world's best batters and it was a no-brainer for us,"" Goenka said.Speaking to TOI, Pooran expressed his happiness at staying at ‘home' and indicated he was available to be the captain if asked. Excerpts from an interview.I feel honoured. I came to LSG in 2023, with back against the wall. They took a chance with me. For some reason, I have fallen in love with this franchise and everything has clicked for me, especially as a batter. I just feel like LSG has helped me grow as a batter and achieve a lot of things over the past two years. Hopefully I will be one of those fellows who can lead them to a title in the next few years.Yes, we will obviously be looking for a captain and whatever decision the management will take, we'll see...all hands on deck. If that question is put to me then I am available, but it all comes down to trust. If the management believes in me, having seen me for a couple of years...I am all hands on deck. But at the moment my focus is to score runs, win as many games as possible and try to create a winning atmosphere.Yeah, of course, I was quite young and West Indies were in a transition period. I was trying to be the best version of myself, trying to be the best batter in the world and I had a lot of young players around me, who were also trying to figure out their game. We know how frustrating that can be. The search for perfection is really difficult and that's what I wanted when I was the captain, but it takes time. I relinquished captaincy for different reasons and I thought it was the best decision I made because I had started to struggle as a batter. As I see it 3-4 years down the line, captaincy has actually helped me grow as a human being and cricketer.It is my opinion (laughs), but I have captained one game in the IPL and also in other leagues, and I have done good. But I believe if captaincy has to come in my direction again, it will come at the right time. At this moment, it's all about one thing: Be the best version of Nicholas Pooran and continue to entertain people.I obviously want us to win games. But winning is difficult and we have to understand how to win, particularly in home conditions and it is all about building that team. It is all about getting players who actually want to play and win for this franchise.",Nicholas Pooran has been retained by Lucknow Super Giants. The Trinidadian batsman relinquished the West Indies captaincy. Pooran indicated he was available to be the captain if asked. He said he was honoured to be retained by the IPL franchise.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114830892,imgsize-51336,width-400,resizemode-4/114830892.jpg"

Hosts seek redemption as New Zealand eye historic clean sweep

BREAKING NEWS: #IPL 2025 Final Retentions

MUMBAI: Are we on the brink of the biggest upset of the 21st century? In a year when Test cricket has ripped apart the formbook, can New Zealand do the unthinkable? After Bangladesh’s stunning 2-0 victory over Pakistan on their home turf, England’s home losses to Sri Lanka and Pakistan, the Kiwis — fresh off a heavy defeat in Sri Lanka — have secured their maiden series win in India and now stand on the verge of an unprecedented 3-0 whitewash over India, one of the toughest Test teams to beat on home soil.Only a month ago, New Zealand left Galle bruised after a brutal series loss to Sri Lanka, where they were bowled out for 88 & 360 as Sri Lanka amassed a massive 602 for five declared. Now, with the third Test against India starting today, one wonders: will Wankhede Stadium witness New Zealand's own ""Gabba moment,"" akin to India's famous triumph over Australia at Brisbane in Jan 2021?This time, the tables have turned. Despite missing their captain Kane Williamson and senior pacer Trent Boult, the Kiwis have already stunned a seasoned Team India in back-to-back Tests — on a seaming pitch in Bengaluru and a turner in Pune. Can they clinch one more victory at a venue where India hasn't lost since Nov 2012?For India, it's more than pride on the line. Head coach Gautam Gambhir , part of India's last loss at Wankhede to England in 2012, will be cautious, especially given the left-arm spin threat of Mitchell Santner and Ajaz Patel, who have proven themselves highly dangerous on turning tracks. India desperately needs a win here, not only to salvage pride but also to stay in contention for the World Test Championship final and to reaffirm their dominance on spinning pitches that have been their strength since that 2012 series.This match could also be a pivotal moment for India's senior players. Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli , R Ashwin, and Ravindra Jadeja have all been stalwarts, but another loss might bring additional scrutiny as they enter the twilight of their careers. Both Sharma and Kohli have struggled this series, with Kohli notably dismissed by a Santner full toss in Pune, while Ashwin and Jadeja's spin prowess has been overshadowed by their Kiwi counterparts.New Zealand, bolstered by their balanced spin and seam attack and standout performances from Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra , deserves credit for staging a remarkable turnaround. The question remains: Can India rise to the occasion at Wankhede, or are we about to witness an upset for the ages?",New Zealand are on the brink of an unprecedented 3-0 whitewash over India.

BREAKING & LIVE : #IPL 2025 Final Retentions @ 5.30pm

Heinrich Klaasen (SRH) - Rs 23 crore

Virat Kohli ( RCB ) - Rs 21 crore

) - Rs 21 crore Nicholas Pooran (LSG) - Rs 21 crore

In a surprising turn of events on Thursday, South African wicketkeeper-batter Heinrich Klaasen outshone one of cricket’s biggest icons, Virat Kohli , by securing the highest retention price ahead of IPL 2025 mega auction.Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) retained Klaasen for a staggering sum of Rs. 23 crore, marking a significant statement on his impact in the tournament and the value he brings to his franchise.Klaasen’s performances in the previous IPL season, where he showcased his explosive batting and consistent match-winning abilities, have evidently bolstered his worth in the eyes of SRH.His ability to handle high-pressure situations and accelerate the innings makes him a versatile and invaluable asset in the T20 format. As a result, SRH chose to retain Klaasen at an eye-watering price, reflecting their belief in his potential to drive the team’s success in the upcoming season.Following Klaasen, RCB’s Kohli was retained for Rs 21 crore, a slightly lower amount compared to Klaasen. Despite being one of the most popular and accomplished players in the league, Kohli’s retention price reflects RCB’s balanced approach to squad building while still banking on his leadership and experience to guide the franchise in IPL 2025.Meanwhile, West Indies wicketkeeper-batsman Nicholas Pooran was also retained at Rs 21 crore, same as Kohli, by the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG). Pooran, known for his hard-hitting and dynamic style, proved his worth last season and was rewarded with one of the top retention prices this year.These high-profile retentions underline the franchises' confidence in their core players, setting the stage for an exciting season ahead.","South African wicketkeeper-batter Heinrich Klaasen outshone one of cricket’s biggest icons, Virat Kohli.

Thankfully, none of my family came to any physical harm,"" he wrote on X. ""Understandably, however, the experience has had an impact on their emotional and mental state. All we can think about is how much worse this situation could have been.""The thieves took jewelry and ""other valuables and a good deal of personal items. Many of those items have real sentimental value for me and my family. They are irreplaceable.""In an effort to assist the police in apprehending the burglars, Stokes claimed he made the news public. He shared pictures of a few of the pilfered goods.""Although we have lost cherished possessions, to be clear, my sole motivation in sharing these photographs is not the recovery of material items.

I was desperate for India A call... dream is to play for the country: Baba Indrajith,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/baba-indrajith-exclusive-interview-tamil-nadu-india-a-squad-australia/articleshow/114775370.cms,"Baba Indrajith. (PTI Photo)

exclusive conversation with Timesofindia.com

Excerpts:

Baba Indrajith plays a shot during the Ranji Trophy match between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka at M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. Image: PTI

Twelve years back, you missed the U-19 World Cup bus and were naturally very dejected. Cut to 2024, you are very close to taking the next step, a very crucial step, in your career, and it's going to happen in Australia too. Was there desperation to get that call after years of consistency with the bat?

Did you approach this season any differently? Duleep Trophy squads were picked by national selectors and good outings would have made the right noise. Did you think about what the future had in store - the A tour... ?

And when it finally happened, did it feel overwhelming? Like you put your feet up and say, boss this has finally happened!

How have your preparations been like for the challenge Down Under?

Even after playing First Class cricket for so long, you don't have a lot of overseas exposure and there have been only few outings in Bangladesh some time back. How much are your picking from your brother Aparajith because he has been to Australia multiple times.

Two of your senior state-mates have been very vocal in their support for you. Both Dinesh Karthik and R Ashwin have been regularly highlighting your efforts in the domestic circuit on social media. How special is it to get their support, and how has it been spending a lot of time with Ashwin during the TNPL?

How's the mood in the house - parents, Aparajith...

You have had some freak injuries in the past but how frustrating was it to get injured during the Duleep Trophy fixture. You have batted with stitches, returned from multiple surgeries but this was very close to the Australia tour...

Some twelve years back, Baba Indrajith was at one of the lowest points of his cricketing career when he wasn't picked for India U-19 squad for the World Cup. He was dejected but very happy for his twin brother Baba Aparajith who made the cut and had a good outing Down Under with the side which won the title.With no U-19 launchpad, Indrajith had no option but to undergo the domestic grind for Tamil Nadu but little would he would have imagined that it would take more than a decade for the next step.Also See: Cricket Live Score Season-after-season, he kept piling on the runs for Tamil Nadu in the middle-order but could never go beyond the Zone side. Multiple A tours happened during this duration but Indrajith's name was constantly missing from the squad sheets.He did get frustrated at times, desperation creeped in to do things differently but one thing remained constant - the runs. After 80 First Class appearances, the sweet reward finally came his way when he was named in India A squad for the tour of Australia Yes, Australia. The same Australia where he wanted to go with India U-19 side as a teenager and 12 years later, he will be donning the shining whites and will take a crucial step towards realising his ultimate dream of playing for the country.In an, Tamil Nadu's run-machine talks about his long journey, the injury fears in Duleep Trophy, the ""different feeling"" in the household and the desperation to get the India A opportunity.Australia has been a special place in our family. Because Apar (Aparajith) travelled to Australia a lot of times and won the World Cup. I would have wanted to be at the U-19 World Cup as well but I never felt like that they should have picked me or something like that. I was very happy for Apar but never thought on these lines. Only when you told me, I was able to recollect all of that.And yes, I think you can say I was desperate. It's not wrong to say I was. I was actually desperate to get this opportunity because being in the domestic circuit for so long, and obviously that expectation of getting the break would be there. Very, very happy that everything happens for a reason and comes at the right time. So I'm happy that it's happened now.Was the opportunity coming up in my mind? Definitely, yeah. But I wanted to focus on the things I could do correctly because if I put too much pressure on myself then it would be very difficult. But at the same time, if I say that, okay, I didn't think about all of these tours or whatever that is coming up, I would be lying. So it was there in the back of the mind. And obviously, whenever I wrote it down and I said, like, if I get my eye in, or if I get set, then I will think of these tours or whatever it is coming up, and then I will push myself to score big. So that was there in my mind. But I wasn't putting too much pressure on myself saying that, okay, this is the thing. I know Duleep Trophy is very very important and I knew if I score runs, I would get an opportunity.You have been at it for more than a decade in the First Class circuit. You play Tamil Nadu Premier League, have been part of IPL teams and there has been continuous cricket. Did it get exhausting at some point? Did you ask questions like - what more is needed, what do I need to do to take that next step...Obviously, I mean, all of these thoughts came in. Because, as you said, the domestic scene is not very easy. It's a very hard toil for so long. So all of these hardships come to you, I mean, come to your mind. So whenever you get the opportunity, or whenever you get the break, that realisation will be even more, because you know how hard you work to get here. So. yeah, in a way, I feel it's a good thing, because when you get an opportunity like this, you know the value of it, yeah.I understand what you're saying, but I mean, like, it hasn't gone to that level. But obviously it was emotional. I will be very honest, it was emotional because, yeah, I've been waiting for this opportunity for a very long time. It was kind of emotional but at the same time, I told myself that, okay, this is just one step ahead because my dream is to play for the country. It is a little bit overwhelming, but not too much, because I don't want it to be too overwhelming. If that happens, then I will be satisfied just getting selected for India, which I don't want. I want to go there and do well. I know there will be a lot of hype. Obviously there will be a lot of expectations.I have done whatever preparation I could do in terms of skill, mentally, physically, whatever it is, because I know the value of this. So I will give everything. And obviously that dream to play for the country and do well for the country is there. So I don't want this to be too overwhelming, yeah, but at the same time, I'm leaving the result to the universe. So I will do everything... whatever I've been doing in the domestic circuit. I will try and do the same thing there.I will somehow get to the same pattern. Obviously, wherever you go, even if it is from Chennai to Delhi or from Chennai to Mumbai, conditions are going to be different, correct? So similarly, when you go to Australia, it's going to be even more different. And you will not crack the code or find the pattern, or even if you play the domestic circuit for so long.With whatever experience I have, I should go there and adapt quickly. So the adaptation is going to be very, very important, yeah. And if I adapt and things go well, God willing, then I would be very happy.I have been picking his (Aparajith) brain. And a lot of other people too because if I can get something out of everybody then I feel it's going to help me. And no better person than Apar because I'll be able to relate to him much better than anybody else. He has gone there thrice, not just once. So it's going to be very helpful.And outside of India, I have played just three games in Bangladesh and that too rain affected. So to be very honest, I have not had exposure outside of India. So as I said, even if it's outside of India, even if it's in the subcontinent or outside the continent, it is going to be different. You are going to take time to adapt, and when it's in Australia, obviously, conditions are going to be even more different. So I don't want to be overwhelmed or be worried about it.I've accepted the fact that it's going to be different. It is better to adapt. That's the one thing I could do from my side, apart from that kind of preparation because you're not going to play a domestic season there for a month or two or for a year and then get used to the conditions. Apart from that, I feel like I can do a lot of visualisation and preparation in terms of watching matches and everything. I've been doing that personally but want to get too much into the details but I've been preparing myself.I think their help has been great... immense. DK, I know him personally for a very long time and he's been supportive and also helpful in my game as well, in terms of preparation and everything, whatever it is, he doesn't hold back. I can call him anytime and then ask for his help, Even before the Duleep Trophy, he told me certain things as to how to practice and go about things, and Ashwin has been an immense help too.There is no need for Ashwin or Dinesh Karthik to put out a tweet or be supportive on social media for me, but they take that extra initiative and step because whenever someone does well, they make sure that it is seen outside. Because you know it's not easy. If they don't put it, nobody's going to ask them why. If they don't show their support, nobody is going to ask... but to take that initiative and be supportive has been very, very helpful.And one thing with Ashwin is that he doesn't make you feel like you're talking to someone who's taken over 500 Test wickets. He comes down to your level and talks. And it's not like he plays in the TNPL for the sake of it. He plays it with intensity and wants you to improve your game all the time. So all of these things, even if it's a different format, it definitely helps.And when you play Ashwin in the net(s) you will definitely get the confidence. So you feel like that if you can play a bowler who has picked 500 Test wickets, you will be able to manage other players. Sometimes you get overwhelmed with the players who you've seen on TV, and then directly go and play with them. Okay, these are like, big bowlers, big players. You feel like that. But when you are able to face the challenge and take the challenge of Ashwin, who has taken 500 Test wickets you will gain a lot of confidence.And if he gives a pat on the back, saying that, okay, you are doing well, then nothing more than that. That confidence is going to be very, very high. And obviously DK has a lot of experience in the IPL, is commentating all around the world, is coaching and everything. So they both have been very, very instrumental.It's a bit different because obviously it's a new challenge for Apar moving to another state and playing as a professional. It's a different challenge and it's different for us also because we are so used to playing for the same team. So it's a bit different. But in the household, I think they're very, very happy for me. Father, mother... because they have seen my struggles for all these years, and they're very, very happy for me, and obviously Apar is also very happy. But it's difficult for my parents also because 10 or 12 years back, the scenario was different. Now the scenario is different.So as parents, you want both your kids to do well. But sometimes it is different. It is different. Difficult for them to handle all of that. But the good thing is that between me and Apar there's always been a good rapport. We have always helped each other become better cricketers. So that has been okay, but overall, right now, everybody is happy for me, and they want me to go there, enjoy myself and do well.To be very honest with you, the minute I fell down, because I knew the Australia tour was coming, I didn't tell anybody, but I was aiming for it. But the minute I fell down, the first thought went to Australia, will I be missing it again? Missing the India opportunity again? So I troubled a lot of my strength and conditioning courses and physios asking, What is the grade? One, what if it's Grade 2? How long will it take? In 10 days, one week and all of that. And I did a lot of research.When you are scared or worried or anxious, you will do all of those things to make sure that you somehow get on the flight to Australia, because it happened on the third game. I thought, okay, I was going to play the Rest of India game, and I will get the opportunity because I got two good scores in Duleep Trophy. And that third game, I was batting on 35 so I thought I have a decent chance to go to Australia.But the minute I fell down all those things... like I was really, really upset. The physical pain was there but mentally I was gone. But I think with a lot of help from the strength and conditioning coaches I did everything possible. I did absolutely everything possible, right from my diet to my sleep time to everything to make sure that I got fit for the first Ranji Trophy game. Because only if I played Ranji, I will be cleared for fitness. So all of these things were running in my mind, and I think, as they say, everything happens for a reason, and I'm happy and thankful that I was able to be fit for the first time.","Baba Indrajith has been named in the India A squad for the tour of Australia.

NEW DELHI: Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola 's recent comments on the historic rivalry between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have sparked a fresh wave of discussion and debate in the world of football .Speaking at a pre-match press conference on Tuesday, the Spaniard opened up on a long-running rivalry between Messi and Ronaldo.""No one could beat Messi, only Cristiano. Cristiano was a monster and the father of that monster is Messi. The two have achieved something incredible in the last 20 years,"" said Guardiola.Guardiola's remarks came on the back of the 2024 Ballon d'Or ceremony, where Manchester City's Rodri emerged as the winner, breaking the long-standing duopoly of Messi and Ronaldo.The Spanish midfielder's triumph was celebrated as a victory for Spanish football and a recognition of the often-overlooked role of midfielders in the game.Rodri's win marked a significant milestone, as he became the first defensive midfielder to claim the Ballon d'Or since Lothar Matthaus in 1990 and only the third Spaniard to receive the honour, following in the footsteps of Alfredo Di Stefano and Luis Suarez.His win is particularly noteworthy as it ends a long drought for Spanish players in the Ballon d'Or rankings, with no Spaniard having won the award since Luis Suarez in 1960, despite Spain's ""golden generation"" achieving significant success on the international stage.“Maybe Xavi and Iniesta deserved it at that time, so I think yesterday Rodri achieved what Spanish football deserved worldwide,” Guardiola further added.The 2024 Ballon d'Or ceremony was massively dominated by Rodri's compatriots, national teammate Lamine Yamal winning the Kopa Trophy for the best Under-21 player, Aitana Bonmati securing the women's Ballon d'Or for the second consecutive year, and Jennifer Hermoso being honoured with the Socrates Award for her role in the fight for women's rights in football and her courageous stance against sexism in sport.","Guardiola's comments come on the back of the 2024 Ballon d'Or ceremony.

Brief Scores:

AHMEDABAD: Opener and vice-captain Smriti Mandhana (100 off 122 balls; 10x4) answered questions about her form with a timely century as India chased down a 233- run target with six wickets to spare in the third and final ODI against New Zealand here on Tuesday.With meaningful contributions from captain Harmanpreet Kaur (59 not out; 63b; 6x4), No. 3 Yastika Bhatia (35; 49b; 4x4) and finishing touches from Jemimah Rodrigues (22; 18b; 4x4), the hosts chased down the target in 44.2 overs to take the series 2-1.India’s pursuit of 233 commenced with Shafali Verma striking two exquisite boundaries before she was caught down the leg side by Isabella Gaze off pacer Hannah Rowe. However, Mandhana and Bhatia batted in a composed manner, rotating the strike and hitting the odd bad ball for boundaries as India reached 40 for 1 in the first 10 overs.Mandhana’s first boundary came off the 27th delivery she faced while Bhatia got off the mark with a straight drive off Lea Tahuhu. Smriti lofted Eden Carson for a boundary over mid off before Yastika smashed the same bowler over extra cover for another four. Bhatia then hit Sophie Devine straight down the ground before spooning a catch back to the bowler off the next ball.Harmanpreet and Smriti's partnership started off slowly but eventually all the bowlers bore the brunt of their hitting prowess. Devine was struck for three boundaries while left-arm spinner Fran Jonas and pacer Rowe were smashed to all parts of the ground.Smriti was bowled just after she completed her hundred, off Rowe’s scrambled seam delivery. Jemimah's cameo, in which she struck four exquisite boundaries, was cut short by Jonas, who trapped her in front.Earlier, India had New Zealand in a spot of bother, first at 36 for 3 and then again at 88 for 5, but the White Ferns added 144 runs for the last five wickets to reach 232 in 49.5 overs.India 236 for 4 (Mandhana 100, Harmanpreet 59; Rowe 2 for 47) beat New Zealand 232 (Halliday 86, Deepti 3 for 39, Mishra 2 for 41) by 6 wickets.","Opener and vice-captain Smriti Mandhana (100 off 122 balls; 10x4) answered questions about her form with a timely century.

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant will turn out in new colours from IPL 2025 as the wicketkeeper-batter doesn't feature in Delhi Capitals ' list of retained players. The franchise has decided to retain Axar Patel Kuldeep Yadav , Tristian Stubbs and Abhishek Porel, and have also kept the option of Right To Match (RTM) card open for the mega auction.As TOI.com had reported earlier this month, DC were open to retaining Pant but not as their captain and the youngster wanted to continue leading an IPL franchise. Both Pant and the DC leadership had numerous discussions on the way forward but the final decision is understood to have been made today.""Rishabh Pant wanted captaincy, wanted to be involved with regards to appointment of coaches and support staff but plenty in the DC set-up are not convinced about his T20 game.

There is an option of Axar Patel but it is understood that the franchise would explore options at the mega-auction and don't be surprised if they go aggressively for Shreyas Iyer ""Axar Patel is there as an option but there is a strong possibility of DC exploring options at the mega auction. Plenty of captaincy options are set to enter the mega auction so wait and watch is going to be the right way forward for DC.

MUMBAI: New Zealand skipper Tom Latham said on Thursday that the World Test Championship has given a context to Tests because of which we are seeing more result-oriented games. While New Zealand have sealed the series 2-0, the 12 points that teams will earn if they go on to win the third Test means the interest in the Wankhede Stadium game hasn't waned.""The context ( WTC ) has put on Test cricket rather than the bilateral series has been fantastic.

MUMBAI: How did India get bamboozled by New Zealand spinners? Ask head coach Gautam Gambhir and he says it all ""comes down to T20 cricket "".Speaking on the eve of the third Test at the Wankhede Stadium , Gambhir didn’t mince words when he spoke at length about how playing T20s has led to batters' downfall when it came to honing their defensive technique and the ability to play with soft hands in the longest format. India's batters were at sixes and sevens against Black Caps' left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner , who finished with match figures of 13/157 in the second Test in Pune. That was the first time the 32-year-old had taken a five-wicket haul in his 29-match Test career.""It has a lot to do with T20 cricket. When you are used to muscling the ball, you end up forgetting the soft hands… stuff which used to happen eight or 10 years back. That is why I say that a complete cricketer is one who would play the T20 format successfully as well as Tests. One can adapt his game. That is what growth is.""Growth is not only about hitting the ball in the stands. It's also about batting sessions on a turning track, where you know that you will not be able to hit in the stands, but you will be able to rotate better. For that, I think the foundation is very important.,"" said Gambhir.""You see people like Virat (Kohli) and all the great players who've done well in Tests for a long period of time. They've always had the defence. The foundation of your batting in Tests must be defence and then you start from there.""The drooping shoulders and the grim faces after the defeat in Pune showed how much the series defeat has affected the team.

Who next after Pant: Iyer or Axar?

NEW DELHI: After months of intense discussions with the Delhi Capitals management, Rishabh Pant has finally decided to move on from the franchise and enter the IPL mega auction next month. Pant didn’t opt for retention following a very emotional call with the owners on Wednesday evening.The development has thrown the auction wide open. TOI understands a lot of the franchises have already reached out to Pant and have started planning their auction strategy around him. Punjab Kings, with a remaining purse of Rs 110 cr and former Delhi Capitals coach Ricky Ponting in the ranks, will pose the biggest competition for other franchises on auction day. Chennai Super Kings , looking to carry out a transition from MS Dhoni, will also be tempted along with Lucknow Super Giants and Royal Challengers Bengaluru .It has been an emotional week for Pant and Capitals after he had communicated his wish to move on to management in the second week of Oct. The Capitals management tried to reach common ground with Pant till the last hour before submitting their retentions to BCCI on Oct 31. TOI understands that Pant was offered top retention and was definitely in the process of building a team for next season. However, things changed once the two owners - GMR group and JSW group - decided to split responsibilities and operations of the team on a two-year rotation basis earlier this month.Pant has had multiple meetings with the owners from Aug. Discussions around planning for the next season had been initiated. But once the business agreement was made between the two co-owners, there were certain differences in opinions. Pant has been the most prolific batter in the history of the franchise.""Pant has had a cordial relationship with both owners. But it was getting difficult to have a common vision and direction where the team was headed. To get so many people on the same page at so many levels was something he was unsure of,"" a source close to the development told TOI.""It was a very emotional moment for all the stakeholders. Pant has been an integral part of the franchise since he was first bought in 2016. The owners and Pant didn't want this relationship to end easily. So, they kept trying till the end. But Pant decided that he would rather leave on good terms and be a bone of contention,"" the source said.The GMR group, which is in charge of operations for the next two seasons, decided to rope in Hemang Badani as head coach and Venugopal Rao as director of cricket. It is learnt that Pant was not kept in the loop during the appointment process. ""The GMR group was the sole owner of the team when Pant was bought in 2016. They share a very fond relationship with Pant. But Pant expected a greater role in the franchise which was agreed upon in Aug. But somehow that wasn’t translating into anything,"" the source added.While Axar Patel seems to be the obvious top retention followed by Kuldeep Yadav, the franchise will be looking for an established name to succeed Pant as the captain.Delhi Capitals had generated highest ever revenue once Pant made his comeback after injury in the 2024 season. The stadium was packed for every game. It will be tough for the franchise to garner such a fanbase without Pant.TOI has learnt that Capitals management has interest in getting Shreyas Iyer as it is likely that the IPL-winning captain won’t be retained by Kolkata Knight Riders. It is also learnt that Iyer wasn’t happy that KKR refused to give him top retention. ""The GMR group has already had conversations with Iyer. This franchise, when it was known as Delhi Daredevils, had given Iyer his first contract. Iyer was the captain when Capitals made the IPL final in 2020 before parting ways in 2022 as the franchise appointed Pant as the captain in 2021 when Iyer was out injured,"" the source said.","Rishabh Pant has decided to move on from the Delhi Capitals management.

Yuste doubtful starter:

Three days after snapping their nine-match winless run across competitions, East Bengal FC are gearing up for another key hurdle to cross when they take on Lebanon's Nejmeh FC in their final Group A match of the AFC Challenge League in Thimphu on Friday.At stake for Oscar Bruzon's team is not only a place in quarterfinals of the remodeled third tier of men's AFC club competitions, but a much-required confidence-booster before resuming action in the Indian Super League East Bengal are second in the group with 4 points, 2 points behind a perfect Nejmeh.Eight teams will progress to the quarterfinals from the group stage — the three group winners and best-ranked runners-up from the West, and the top two finishers of each group from the East.Should East Bengal finish second, they will still have a chance to advance, but their fate may depend on the day's second match between hosts Paro FC (1 point) and already-eliminated Bashundhara Kings (0 point).East Bengal's talk of resurgence has gathered steam from their 4-0 demolition of Bashundhara on Tuesday, the team's first win in 10 matches in the season. They held Paro 2-2 in the opener with Dimitri Diamantakos scoring in both matches.""The last game (against Bashundhara), especially its first half, was a beautiful art of football. We are slowly improving and I believe the players can be ready for another high intensity football,"" Bruzon told reporters in Thimphu on Thursday.East Bengal have faced Nejmeh SC twice in Asian football earlier, losing 0-3 away and 0-4 at home in 2010 AFC Cup group stage.Bruzon is aware of the challenge on hand. ""There's no speculation or calculation and both teams will go for the win and qualify for the knockout stage. So, the analysis is quite simple,"" the East Bengal coach said.Defender Hector Yuste is a doubtful starter after suffering a muscle pull during Friday's match. Team captain and fellow Spaniard Saul Crespo insisted that others can live up to the challenge since the team has ""players who can play at different positions.""Midfielder Souvik Chakrabarti, an unlikely scorer in his team's demolition of Bashundhara, also stressed on the need of building on the momentum. ""The victory (against Bashundhara) is more important than my personal milestone. We want to improve together as a unit and win more matches,"" he said.The match will kick off at 3.30pm IST at Thimphu's Changlimithang Stadium on Friday.","East Bengal FC take on Lebanon's Nejmeh FC in final Group A match of AFC Challenge League.

East Bengal FC ended their winless run of the season in style, blowing away Bangladesh champions Bashundhara Kings 4-0 in their second Group A match of the inaugural AFC Challenge League in Thimphu on Tuesday.Oscar Bruzon’s side, with its back to the wall, finally came to the fore with a statement win, with Dimitri Diamantakos opening the floodgates in just 35 seconds — the club’s quickest goal in international football .Goals from Souvik Chakrabarti (20), Nandhakumar Sekar (26) and Anwar Ali (33) helped East Bengal kill the game as a contest in the first half itself. It was East Bengal’s first win since beating Downtown Heroes in the Durand Cup on August 7, during which period they have lost 8 matches in a row before sharing the spoils 2-2 with Bhutanese side Paro FC in the Challenge League opener.East Bengal got off to a rampaging start, and the way they stormed the Bashundhara area with so much magic and menace that the Bangladesh champions didn’t have an answer to it.Diamantakos started the rout, turning in Lalchungnunga’s low centre across the face of the goal with his left foot. Bruzon’s strategy of pressing the opponents high on the pitch and then finding an attacker with pinpoint and purposeful crosses often bypassing the middle third while Nandhakumar posing a constant threat with his pace and potency along the left flank — kept bearing fruit with almost every move in the first half.In the 20th minute, Naorem Mahesh blew Nandhakumar’s cutback over the bar, but when they came calling again barely a few seconds later, they found an unlikely scorer in Souvik. Bashundhara captain Topu Barman managed to deal with a Saul Crespo attempt, but the East Bengal No. 23 found the back of the net with his left-footed snap shot from the edge of the box.Six minutes later, it became 3-0.Nandhakumar, receiving the ball from Talal, entered the box with his trademark pacey run, took rival defender Raiman Kazi in his stride with a swift outside dodge and drilled the ball into the far corner past goalkeeper Anisur Rahman.There was no let-up in East Bengal’s attacking intensity and Anwar joined the party with a spectacular left-footed strike from near the D. Bashundhara did trouble East Bengal on a few occasions with goalkeeper Prabhsukhan effecting a couple of saves to deny Foysal Fahim while Jonathan Reis had his shot denied by the woodwork.East Bengal too could have swelled their tally had second-half substitutions Cleiton Silva and David Hmar been on target with their shots.East Bengal with 4 points are second in the group and will take on leaders Nejmeh FC of Lebanon, who have won both their matches. The top two finishers of each group from the East will progress to the quarterfinals.","East Bengal FC ended their winless run of the season in style, blowing away Bangladesh champions Bashundhara Kings 4-0 in their second Group A match of the inaugural AFC Challenge League in Thimphu.

You need to get to a situation for luck to play a role: Arjun Kadhe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/you-need-to-get-to-a-situation-for-luck-to-play-a-role-arjun-kadhe/articleshow/114661630.cms,"Arjun Kadhe

PUNE: It was his grandparents who sowed the seeds for Arjun Kadhe ’s career as a professional tennis player.More than two decades ago, when Arjun was taking baby steps in tennis, his paternal grandfather decided to sell their house and set aside the proceeds exclusively to help his grandson follow a dream.“I remember when I was eight years old … at that point we were not financially so super to think about tennis as a viable option for my career. But my granddad had a vision. He told me, ‘Okay, I will do anything. You just play tennis, you want to represent India, you want to play a Grand Slam ’. My parents were living on rent. It was unbelievable,” an emotional Kadhe, 30, said as he jogged his memory back.All the sacrifices, of his and of those around him, and the years of tireless pursuit of excellence bore fruit last week when Arjun claimed his first ATP Tour doubles title , in partnership with Rithvik Choudary at the Almaty Open in Kazakhstan last week.“The credit goes first to my parents, they've made huge sacrifices, then my coaches. Obviously, it's a team effort,” he said.""Obviously, Balu sir (coach M Balachandran) traveling with us, (former South African player) Raven (Klaasen) traveling with us, the Double Dream of India programme is helping us a lot.“And as you said, the journey is long, but it feels really, really good, because you get rewarded. In doubles you're playing 35 weeks alone on the road, and it can be really brutal sometimes.“So this win, we both want to take it in, get confidence, enjoy and go ahead again.”The Indian combination beat three teams ranked in the top-30 on the ATP Tour, including No. 13 pair Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul of France in the second round.In a thriller of a final, Arjun and Rithvik saved five match points in the super tiebreak to beat Germany’s Jakob Schnaitter and Mark Wallner, ranked 26th, 3-6, 7-6 (3), 14-12. Remarkably, the Indians won only 68 points to their rivals’ 80 in the match.Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard to get there in the first place.“I think luck played a big part. But at the same time, we were just talking, the coaches were telling us we lost two finals in the super tiebreak, where we were the better team, in the Challengers. As (personal coach) Hemant (Bendrey) sir was also saying, luck is there, but you have to get yourself into that situation for luck to play it out,” Arjun said.The Punekar, supported by Punit Balan group , rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win.“I'm really grateful that it has happened, but at the same time, I feel I was playing a good level,” he said.“It's about, you know, being there, giving yourself that chance, getting rejected, at some point it will come.“It's not in your hands when that click comes. For some people, it comes early. If they can sustain it, they move to the next level.“Some people get rejected, and get that breakthrough. It's about working hard and trying to improve, and take the next step. Everyone has their own journey, in my opinion.“I feel we deserve it, because I truly believe we have the level. Now it's about going the long way and trying to improve every day and not be satisfied with this one tournament.”Arjun had partnered Rithvik in the latter half of last season but parted ways at the start of 2024. Even before they combined, the Telangana lad had mentioned to Arjun of his desire to play with his previous partner Niki Poonacha whenever he decided to focus on doubles. So, the Maharashtra player was understandably cautious when Rithvik reached out to him in the middle of this season.“I feel like every challenge brings opportunity. At that point (when Rithvik chose to go back to Niki at the start of 2024), I was like, ‘oh my God. we are doing well, blah, blah, blah, what is happening?’ But then, if I look back now, I won (two Challenger) titles (with Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan and Anirudh Chandrasekar),” Arjun said.“So it was really good for me.”This time around, Arjun said, the two were in for the long haul. And long-term partnership is something he strongly believes in.“To develop a good team, you need time,” he said, “because if you keep switching partners, the first few weeks of understanding how we want to play, understanding how my partner wants us to play in the future, what is our best?“For all that to align it takes a little bit of time, and in doubles you have super tiebreak. Sometimes you are winning from (facing) match points, sometimes losing from match points.”The Almaty title had given a pleasant surprise for both Arjun and Rithvik in terms of ranking jump — the latter had broken into the top-100 for the first time in his career, reaching 85 in the ATP charts.That means they will now give it a shot to make the Australian Open cut before closing the season.“Now it's about planning it smartly, taking care of your body, because it's the end of the year, you don't want to overplay,” he said.“If we want to be top-50 in the world, we need to improve a lot. We won this tournament, but those teams are doing so many things better than us. So, it’s important also to play the big events, lose, and then realize this is where we are at.“So, we are not thinking too far ahead, just trying to think next week. How can we try and make Australia? If we don't make it, we still have to try and make French.“The plan will go forward from there.”","Arjun Kadhe claims his first ATP Tour doubles title with Rithvik Choudary at Almaty Open in Kazakhstan. The 30-year-old rose to a career-high 77 in the individual doubles ranking after the win. Arjun acknowledged that luck played its part in their win, but the team needed to work hard.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114661721,imgsize-157286,width-400,resizemode-4/114661721.jpg"
My fighting spirit helped me win my first ITF title: Tanisha Kashyap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/my-fighting-spirit-helped-me-win-my-first-itf-title-tanisha-kashyap/articleshow/114554193.cms,"Tanisha Kashyap in action during the $15,000 ITF women's tennis event in Bengaluru last week. (Photo Credit: KSLTA/Deepthi Indukuri)

For Tanisha Kashyap , 22, the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week will remain special for many reasons, not least because it's her first one on the pro circuit.""This one's really special because it's in my home country, in India, and it's something that I've waited for a while,"" Tanisha said.""I'm really glad how I performed in the week I was actually injured. I had a neck catch which led to my shoulders because of the continuous matches that I played.""And it was tough each and every match to play with that pain, but I managed it really well. Mentally, I stayed strong and I relied on my fitness to win this title.""Tanisha, world ranked 868, overcame Akanksha Nitture 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-1 in the final of the hard court event.The triumph was made all the more memorable by the difficult start to the season wherein she was rendered out of action for three months after undergoing a ""mini surgery"" to treat a meniscus and ACL tear.Tanisha suffered the injury during an event in Monastir, Tunisia, in early April. She was leading in the second set against Finland'sAnastasia Kulikova , a former top-200 player with nine pro titles, when she felt pain but played through it. It was only the following day when she underwent scan, she discovered the full extent of the injury.""I cannot disclose what treatment I got, because I was treated by (Daniil) Medvedev's doctor … (I was) set back for three to four weeks,"" she said.""I was completely off from tennis. I was on crutches. I didn't play for three-four (sic) months. I was just building back my fitness and building the strength of my knee and everything.""So I would say this year has been tough, mentally, physically, and I had to face a lot adversities in the beginning because it was not looking that great.""But through it all, I stayed positive and didn't lose sight of my goal. I worked hard each and every day to build myself back up from injury … to get to where I'm right now, to lift my first pro title.""The time away from action and the subsequent comeback helped her understand her game better.""When I did start, it was also very tough, because when you start to play tournaments, you're trying to figure it out again because there's some pain or there's a certain movement that's bothering you.""So you have to find out, you have to go back and do therapy. It was a process to figure it out and to also strengthen my quads back up to support my knee. So, it was tough.""But, sometimes when there's a lot of chaos, when you have a lot of time, you can really think about tennis from an outside perspective, and you get to know yourself better.""Tunisia seems to be Tanisha's favourite hunting ground, at least this year, and it was for a reason.""The best probable reason why I frequently played in Monastir (is) because I've been boarding in All In Tennis Academy (in France), and it's very close,"" she said.""It's not that expensive to travel, not much of jet lag. And the level of the tournaments in Monastir are way, way, much higher than other places.""And I was still fresh off an injury. If you're injured and suddenly go to Thailand, what do you do? You go to Indonesia, you spend all that money for two weeks and you might not perform well.""It was in Monastir while she was finding her way back in July that she first felt a catch in the neck, which forced her to retire from a $15K event in the second round when she was leading 6-2, 4-1 against Spaniard Victoria Gomez O'Hayon.It was the same issue that cropped up in Bengaluru at the very start of the tournament, and she showed tremendous grit to play through the pain and obvious discomfort it put her in.""Right before my first round, in a certain movement, I jerked it, and I had the same neck catch again,"" she said.""I couldn't look up, I couldn't look to my right, I couldn't serve. And I think throughout this tournament, I had so many double faults. I'm sure the statistics are there.""It taught me something. I stayed strong, I battled each and every point. I ran for each and every shot. I didn't, you know, let anything go. So, that fighting spirit really helped me win this tournament.""And, of course, some strategy here and there, and to play smart tennis.""Smart tennis she did have to play in the final which lasted two hours and 19 minutes.""I knew that I had limited range of motion, and I knew that I couldn't blast my first serves, how I was blasting in Mysuru or before. So I knew that I had to tennis wise, play smart, and place the ball and start off the point and stay in the rallies for my match.""For sure, the neck started to act during the first set, which lasted more than an hour and a half. She delivered nine double faults in the opener, compared to just one for the remainder of the match.""When I was four or five down, my neck started to really catch again, and it was really extremely painful. So I had no other option to call the physio,"" Tanisha said.""The second and third, I took a breather. I just kind of meditated and focused on my game strategy … to place the balls away from her striking zone and to make her work for each and every point.And maybe she wasn't expecting, maybe she thought that I would be tired out and I wouldn't fight back. But I've always been a fighter, and I stayed strong mentally and just stayed in it, and I let her make the errors.""I was calm and cool. I can't explain it, but you know, I just went into my zone.""Tanisha has been mainly coached by her father Suresh Kalita. But she had worked with former Davis Cupper Vishaal Uppal and Billie Jean King Cup player Rushmi Chakravarthi among other coaches. She also had a short stint at the JC Ferrero Tennis Academy in Spain before heading to the Ohio State University to play college tennis.Having seen her share of tennis abroad, the Assam native believes that while the ""commitment level and fitness level"" were the areas where Indian players lagged, it was not necessary that they had to relocate to elsewhere to make the breakthrough.""We can definitely do that here as well. Like I said, it depends on the individual and how much they want to do it.""They might be doing the same exercises that the Europeans are doing, but it's not up to the standard that the Europeans are doing. In the sense, the effort, the physical ability, how much you are pushing yourself.""I've always believed that it's an individual's choice. And, there are some great tennis coaches, fitness coaches here. But in the end of the day, it's how hard you push yourself.""As for herself, Tanisha is not ready to rest on her Bengaluru laurels.""""This is just the beginning of something,"" she said, ""it's a good achievement, but I'm looking for more. I'm gonna get back to train and recover, to win some more, hopefully soon.""It's just one of the small stepping stones towards the bigger picture and the bigger goal.""","Tanisha Kashyap, 22, won the $15,000 ITF title in Bengaluru last week.

The organization stresses feedback gathered from key stakeholders, including players, coaches, and umpires.According to the ITF, players perceive the change positively. Coaches view it as beneficial for player development and professional recognition. Umpires appreciate the shift, claiming it allows them to focus on officiating rather than policing coaching violations.However, the decision has drawn criticism from some prominent players.World number six Taylor Fritz took to social media platform X to express his disapproval, stating, ""Can we stop ruining the 1v1 mental/strategic aspect of the sport PLEASE.""Fritz, a US Open finalist, has previously voiced concerns about off-court coaching, believing it diminishes the individual strategic and mental battle inherent to tennis.Former world number 10 Denis Shapovalov echoed Fritz's sentiment, expressing disappointment on X, stating, ""Not just as atennis player but as a fan of this sport it’s sad to see this new off-court coaching rule. Tennis is special because you are out there alone. Why are you trying to change the beauty of this game.""Shapovalov's statement underscores the perspective that off-court coaching undermines the unique solitary nature of tennis, potentially impacting the sport's core appeal.The ITF's decision to formally implement off-court coaching marks a significant shift in the sport's landscape.While the organization emphasizes positive feedback from stakeholders and potential benefits, vocal opposition from high-ranking players like Fritz and Shapovalov highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the rule change and its potential long-term impact on the sport's fundamental dynamics.","The ITF has officially approved off-court coaching, starting January 1, 2025.

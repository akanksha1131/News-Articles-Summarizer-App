Poll Should India continue to experiment with different players in the No. 3 spot? Yes, keep experimenting No, stick with one player

NEW DELHI: Will India stop playing musical chairs with the No. 3 spot and lock in on Sai Sudharsan for the immediate future? That question was still up in the air as the Tamil Nadu batter’s greatest strength, his backfoot play and strength against spin, also proved to be biggest weakness at the Ferozeshah Kotla on Friday.The multi-format left-handed batter’s recent Test form has been patchy at best, in spite of an excellent 61 in Manchester in July, but the factors keeping him in play in the selectors’ eyes were all on view on Friday — the ease and balance of his backfoot play, especially against spin, the power in his backfoot punches, the adaptability to both spin and pace and above all, a keen temperament and rare ability to handle pressure.Yet the weaknesses too are interlinked, like the tendency to play fuller balls too off the back foot, a perceived vulnerability to balls angling in and the hesitation in frontfoot play to balls on off stump.At the Kotla, he was repeatedly caught on the back foot to good-length deliveries till he was undone by leftarm spinner Jomel Warrican identifying the weakness, getting a flatter one to turn appreciably and getting Sudharsan trapped in front.It’s something the Indian team management is acutely aware of, as batting coach Sitanshu Kotak pointed out after the day’s play.“The only thing we talk about is, some of the very full balls also he plays on the back foot. We are trying to cut down on that. He knows that. Coming from Tamil Nadu, he has played a lot on turning tracks and is good against spin. Some of the shots he plays off the back foot, not many players can play. But a lot of balls which he negotiates on the back foot… most batters would negotiate off the front foot,” Kotak said.“Outside the off-stump line, the same length, he could easily go on the front foot and play. Then the impact would be outside off. Yet, he batted brilliantly today. Did you ever feel he was under pressure? His bat swing, the power he generates off the back foot is amazing. Some of the shots through extra cover and midwicket are his strength.”Kotak showed on Friday Sudharsan’s still a work in progress. “I’ve seen him for the last two-three years in India, vs England ‘A’, he batted in three games, got two hundreds. So say, KL would step out, Gill would step out, Jaiswal would if he finds flighted deliveries. But it is not compulsory,” he said.India have gone through six No. 3 batters since the India-NZ home Tests in the middle of 2024 — Kohli (one Test), Gill (5), Padikkal (1), KL Rahul (1), Sudharsan himself (5) and Karun Nair (2). Kohli has since retired, Gill has eased into the No. 4 spot, KL Rahul is back opening the innings and Nair seems to have been overlooked after England. The competition may not be as tough as it seems, and like Kotak said, it’s not compulsory for everyone to play the same way.","Sai Sudharsan's greatest strength, his backfoot play and strength against spin, also proved to be biggest weakness at the Ferozeshah Kotla on Friday.

New Zealand secured a convincing 100-run victory over Bangladesh in the Women's World Cup match, thanks to outstanding fifties from Brooke Halliday and captain Sophie Devine, followed by a strong bowling performance.The White Ferns chose to bat first and posted 227 for nine, recovering from early setbacks through a crucial 112-run partnership between Halliday and Devine.New Zealand's innings began poorly, losing Georgia Pimmer for 4, Suzie Bates for 29, and Amelia Kerr within the first 10.5 overs, leaving them at 38 for three.Devine scored 63 while Halliday contributed 69, as they carefully rebuilt the innings with their fourth-wicket partnership.Bangladesh's batting response was inadequate, resulting in their dismissal for 127 in 39.5 overs, well short of the target.The Bangladesh innings struggled from the start, with five wickets falling by the 14th over for just 30 runs.Several Bangladesh batters, including Rubya Haider, Sharmin Akhter, Nigar Sultana, Sobhana Mostary, Sumaiya Akter, and Shoma Akter, failed to make an impact against the New Zealand bowlers.The highest partnership of the Bangladesh innings came from Fahima Khatun and Rabeya Khan, who added 44 runs for the eighth wicket. Khatun scored 34 while Khan made 25.New Zealand's bowling attack was led by Jess Kerr and Lea Tahuhu, who took three wickets each, conceding 21 and 22 runs respectively. Rosemary Mair claimed two wickets for 20 runs.The early collapse of New Zealand's innings began when Georgia Plimmer was caught by wicketkeeper Nigar Sultana off Rabeya Khan, who finished with three wickets for 30 runs.Halliday reached her fifty with a boundary over mid-on off Nishita Akhter and later hit a six over wide long-on against Shorna Akhter.Devine played a more measured innings, scoring her first boundary in the 38th over.Halliday's innings of 69 included five fours and a six from 104 balls before she was caught behind by Sultana.Devine achieved her third consecutive fifty-plus score in the tournament with a six over long-on, followed by another maximum in the next ball.Her innings ended at 63 runs from 85 balls, including two fours and two sixes, when she was bowled by Nishita while attempting another big shot.The New Zealand innings concluded with Maddy Green's contribution and the quick dismissals of herself and Jess Kerr in consecutive deliveries.","New Zealand secured a convincing 100-run victory over Bangladesh in the Women's World Cup match.

India's Sai Sudharsan expressed the team's intention to extend their batting innings against West Indies in the second Test at Arun Jaitley Stadium on Friday.India reached 318/2 at stumps on day one, with Yashasvi Jaiswal remaining unbeaten on 173 and Sudharsan contributing 87. The team aims to replicate their successful strategy from the first Test in Ahmedabad by posting a substantial first-innings total.""Ideally, we would like to bat just once; we want to bat as long as possible and get the best total we can. We don't have a specific number in mind, but the goal is to make the West Indies bat twice,"" he told JioHotstar.Sudharsan maintained a composed approach throughout his innings, building on his recent success with India A: ""I was not thinking about the pressure or the magnitude of the game. I was coming off a good India A series, so my focus was only on how I could make the innings better. I tried not to think about anything else, just to stay as calm as possible and not get caught up in the occasion.""It was a very composed innings for me. Before the game, I had decided to take a bit more time and let things happen naturally, rather than forcing them. That was the main thought running through my mind. And obviously, batting alongside Jaiswal was fantastic, the way he creates boundaries even off good deliveries is so fascinating to watch from the other end.""Sudharsan acknowledged Shubman Gill's influence on his game and approach, adding, ""The role clarity was definitely there from Shubman, and what I admire most about him is his belief, the belief to come back stronger, to convert starts into big hundreds, and to make the team win. When you see him up close, you realise how much conviction he plays with. I feel that's something I should learn from him, that self-belief is such an important quality to have.

IND vs WI 2nd Test: Team India coach warns Sai Sudharsan despite 87 - 'He very much knows that',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-west-indies/ind-vs-wi-2nd-test-team-india-coach-warns-sai-sudharsan-despite-87-he-very-much-knows-that/articleshow/124459186.cms,"India's Sai Sudharsan (AP Photo/Manish Swarup)

India's batting coach Sitanshu Kotak analysed Sai Sudharsan's dismissal and identified a technical flaw. He is now working with the mentally strong youngster to address this issue.During the first day of the second Test between India and West Indies at Arun Jaitley Stadium, Sudharsan scored an impressive 87 runs from 165 balls. His innings ended when he played on the back foot against vice-captain Jomel Warrican's turning delivery.Sudharsan found himself cramped for space and was caught in front of the stumps. After India's dominant first day, Kotak discussed how the 23-year-old batsman got out despite his known proficiency against spin bowling.""Sai obviously coming from Tamil Nadu, they play a lot on turning wickets, so he is pretty good against spin I think his back foot game and some shots he plays on back foot not many players play or lot of bowls which he negotiates on back foot most of the players would negotiate it on front foot the only thing we talk about is some of the very full bowl also sometime he plays on back foot so we are trying to cut out on that, he very much knows that and he tries,"" Kotak said.Sudharsan, who received his first Test cap in England earlier this year, had scored 147 runs in seven innings before this Test. His declining performance had drawn criticism about his place in the Test team.After KL Rahul's dismissal at 58/1, Sudharsan joined Yashasvi Jaiswal at the crease. The left-handed pair built a substantial 193-run partnership for the second wicket, putting India in a commanding position.""See Sai, we all know how talented he is and every time probably you won't look at the score you would look at the batsman how he is batting how he is placing his innings, what kind of shots he plays sometime one or two innings anybody can fail but he batted brilliantly today I don't think, he is someone who is mentally very tough you will never see him under pressure you will never see he will change his style of playing whatever, he always plays on the merit so the same way he batted today,"" he continued.Following Sudharsan's departure, Jaiswal continued his aggressive batting approach. He remained unbeaten on 173 runs from 253 balls after celebrating his seventh Test century, positioning himself for a potential third double century in Test cricket.""The determination that he showed was important for me. The ball came on the new, better bat. He also bowled the second 50 at a good pace. But I felt that after 60-65 overs, the ball didn't come on the better bat. I think he took enough time; he didn't miss a single shot,"" he added.""Same thing he told me in tea time, and so it shows that last match he felt he missed out on a big inning, so the way he approached, I think it was brilliant. For me, the most important thing was the determination he showed to play a big inning. Obviously, he is still playing, but I think that determination and that belief after not being so aggressive also, he is batting on 173 or 175, so it shows how good he batted.""",Sai Sudharsan was caught in front of the stumps by Jomel Warrican.

Mumbai:

Suryakumar Yadav wants this Bollywood star to play his role in his biopic!

The squad:

In a stunning development, which perhaps could even signal the end of his red-ball career, India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav was on Friday excluded from the 16-man Mumbai squad for the 2025-26 season-opening Ranji Trophy match against Jammu & Kashmir at the Sher-E-Kashmir Cricket Stadium in Srinagar from Oct 15.Led by Sanjay Patil, the senior selection committee—which also included former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar—named India’s Under-19 captain Ayush Mhatre in the squad. Mhatre will fly straight to Srinagar with the rest of the Mumbai team after arriving from Australia, linking up with the side at the Mumbai airport. The team will be led by India’s out-of-favour Test allrounder Shardul Thakur ""No, SKY hasn't been dropped. It's just that his availability wasn't confirmed for this match. The Mumbai Cricket Association's staff tried to contact him (to ask if he would play in the match), but he didn't give his availability for this match to us,"" MCA secretary Abhay Hadap told TOI.An indication that SKY will possibly not be in the Mumbai Ranji Trophy team for the J&K match came when he didn’t feature in Mumbai's three-day practice match against Maharashtra at Gahunje in Pune (which concluded on Thursday) either.“It's fine because in any case, there's no chance that he would be picked for India in Tests, or even the ODIs. He's 35 now, and is playing only in the T20 format for India,"" a source tracking developments told TOI.Surya scored 109 runs in three matches @21.80, including a top score of 70 in the quarterfinals against Haryana, but managed only 0 & 23 as Mumbai lost to eventual champions Vidarbha in the semifinals last season. In his nearly 15-year first-class career since debuting against Delhi in Dec 2010, he has scored 5,758 runs in 86 matches @42.33, with 14 hundreds, 30 fifties, and a top score of 200 against Orissa (now Odisha). He also featured in one Test for India, against Australia in 2023.This will thus be the first time in many years when Mumbai will play without their India's white-ball batting stars Suryakumar and Shreyas Iyer , who has sought a six-month break from red-ball cricket due to back issues.Meanwhile, in a big boost to Mumbai, Sarfaraz Khan has returned to the squad after completing his injury rehab at the BCCI ’s Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru. Sarfaraz had suffered a quadriceps injury while scoring back-to-back hundreds in the Buchi Babu Trophy and was forced to miss the Duleep Trophy and the Irani Trophy as a result. Also in the squad is all-rounder Shivam Dube, fresh off his heroics for India in their Asia Cup triumph in UAE last month.Led by new captain Shardul Thakur, the Mumbai team will travel on Saturday to Srinagar for the match.

India are without a win at the halfway stage of the AFC Asian Cup 2027 final round qualifiers, but miraculously, they are not out of the race either.Reduced to ten men early in the second half after Sandesh Jhingan was sent off just after resumption, Khalid Jamil’s side was a minute away from a second consecutive loss, and almost out of contention. Singapore, however, blundered in the final minute of regulation time as Rahim Ali’s first international goal helped secure a 1-1 result in Singapore on Thursday.Singapore are still on top of the group with five points, three more than India’s two, but they will have a chance to make amends in the home clash next week. Hong Kong (four) and Bangladesh (one) have a game in hand.Only the group winners qualify for the Saudi Arabia edition.“I think it’s going to be difficult, we are just taking one game at a time,” Sunil Chhetri , who returned to the team after being left out for last month’s CAFA Nations Cup, said after the draw. “Going ten men and getting a result wasn’t easy. Just glad to be taking a point away.”Given the circumstances, India will be delighted with a point. When Ikhsan Fandi scored in first half stoppage time for Singapore and Jhingan was sent off for a second yellow, India were left with their backs against the wall.Chances were limited, and the hosts were in the ascendancy, only to blunder right at the end. Without a shot on goal till then and ineffective upfront, India could have only scored from a defensive lapse.India were thrown a lifeline in the 90th minute when Jordan Emaviwe casually played a ball back to goalkeeper Izwan Mahbud. Rahim pressed and the keeper’s clearance struck the feet of the India striker, who was left with an open goal to score his first international goal.For most part, Singapore were the better team, enjoying 63 % ball possession and plenty of looks at the India goal. The hosts had several chances, only to miss, twice from handshaking distance. Ilhan Fandi had two good chances in quick succession.At first, he shot wide, after being put under pressure by a sliding Rahul Bheke, while another attempt from a one-on-one situation with Gurpreet Singh Sandhu saw the keeper effect a good save.Even in the first half with everyone available, India never really posed a threat to the rival goal. Jamil chose to start with two men upfront – Chhetri, Farukh Choudhary – but without creativity in midfield, chances were in short supply.Then, with time running out, Jamil was forced into attacking changes: Udanta Singh, Sahal Abdul Samad and Rahim were all thrown into the mix, and India were ‘rewarded’ with a lucky goal to bring home a point.","Singapore draw 1-1 with India in AFC Asian Cup 2027 qualifier.

Algeria secured their place in the 2026 FIFA World Cup on Thursday with a commanding 3-0 victory over Somalia, becoming the fourth African team to qualify after Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt. The match, played in Oran, saw Wolfsburg striker Mohamed Amoura score twice, while Riyad Mahrez contributed both as scorer and provider.Amoura opened the scoring in just the sixth minute, volleying a precise Mahrez cross into the net. The former Manchester City winger then converted a loose ball in the first half to double the lead. Mahrez once again set up Amoura in the 57th minute, stretching Algeria’s advantage to 3-0. With qualification secured, coach Vladimir Petkovic substituted both scorers to manage the squad ahead of the final round of Group G fixtures.Algeria sit atop Group G with 22 points, four ahead of second-placed Uganda, and will make their fifth World Cup appearance in the United States, Canada, and Mexico next year. Their previous campaigns include first-round exits in 1982, 1986, and 2010, while they reached the second round in 2014 before losing 2-1 to eventual champions Germany.Notably, goalkeeper Luca Zidane, son of French legend Zinedine Zidane, made the squad after switching allegiance from France to Algeria.Elsewhere on the continent, Kenya defeated Burundi 1-0 in a fiery East African derby, with Ryan Ogam scoring the decisive goal. Burundi played almost the entire match with 10 men following a straight red card for Bonfils-Caleb Bimenyimana. The win lifted Kenya to third place in Group F, eight points behind leaders Ivory Coast, who can confirm their fourth World Cup spot with a win in their penultimate fixture.As Africa’s qualification race heats up, nine matches are scheduled Friday, including a crucial Group C round where Benin, South Africa, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Lesotho all remain in contention. With Algeria now guaranteed a place, attention shifts to the remaining spots, ensuring high-stakes drama across the continent’s qualifying groups.","Algeria secured their place in the 2026 FIFA World Cup on Thursday with a commanding 3-0 victory over Somalia.

The Argentine Football Association announced his passing on Wednesday, following a recent deterioration in his health.

The coach of Argentine football club Boca Juniors, Miguel Angel Russo, has died at the age of 69, the Argentine Football Association announced Wednesday.Russo's health had deteriorated in recent weeks.The last Boca Juniors game he attended was on September 21, when his team drew 2-2 with Central Cordoba in a league match at Boca's home ground.Boca Juniors never gave details of his health, but Argentine media reported that the coach, diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2017, had contracted a urinary tract infection.Boca Juniors, in a statement, expressed ""profound sadness"" at Russo's death.""Miguel leaves an indelible mark on our club and will always be an example of joy, warmth, and dedication,"" it said.In his absence, his assistant Claudio Ubeda had been managing the club.A man of few words, Russo was a coach for more than half his life and was talked up at one point as a potential manager for the national side after significant stints with Boca Juniors, Rosario Central and Estudiantes de la Plata.He spent his own playing career entirely at Estudiantes, from 1975 to 1988, forming part of one of the most memorable midfields in Argentine football, along with Alejandro Sabella, Marcelo Trobbiani, and Jose Daniel ""Bocha"" Ponce.He made the national team but wasn't selected for the 1986 World Cup in which Diego Maradona famously captained Argentina to victory.Years later, Russo admitted he was angry at being sidelined but said iconic coach Carlos Bilardo explained: ""'The day you become a coach, you'll understand, like never before.' And later, I understood.""Russo's trophy cabinet was not extensive, but he had a knack for reviving the fortunes of top teams.His first first-division title came with Velez Sarsfield in 2005. Later, at Maradona's request, he was called on to manage Boca Juniors, which he led to victory in the 2007 Copa Libertadores, his greatest achievement as a manager.He sealed an eternal love affair with Rosario Central, which he twice saved from relegation, by winning the League Cup in December 2023.In 2017, he led Colombian side Millonarios to a championship title just one day after undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, earning himself undying affection in Bogota.In June, he agreed to coach Boca Juniors for a third time, four years after being sacked by the giants just six games into a new season.","Boca Juniors coach Miguel Angel Russo has died at the age of 69.

'Block Everything': Italy’s Pro-Palestine Protests Enter Day 2, 60+ Hurt As Police Clash With Mob

Poll Should the match between Italy and Israel be postponed due to political tensions? Yes, safety is a priority No, the game should proceed as planned

Italy’s hopes of automatic qualification for the 2026 World Cup are under pressure, as the national team prepares to face Israel in Udine next Tuesday amid rising political tensions. The match comes at a sensitive time, following a weekend of some of Europe’s largest pro-Palestinian demonstrations across Italy.Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest Israel’s ongoing military offensive in Gaza, which followed a Hamas attack on Israeli communities on October 7, 2023. Calls to ban Israel from international sport have grown louder, and demonstrators even targeted the Italian team’s training centre in Florence, demanding the qualifier be called off.Only around 4,000 tickets have been sold for the Udine match, a city chosen to minimize potential disorder. Udine previously hosted Israel in September 2024 during the Nations League, a match that passed largely without incident but required heavy security, including soldiers stationed on the stadium roof. Despite these precautions, the mayor of Udine, Alberto Felice De Toni, has requested the game be postponed due to fears of larger protests.Italy coach Gennaro Gattuso described the situation as “very sad”, lamenting the unusual atmosphere for a crucial match.“There will be 10,000 people outside the stadium and 5-6,000 inside it... I would have preferred to play a home match in front of an enthusiastic crowd like we did in Bergamo (where Italy beat Estonia 5-0) a month ago,” he said.Italy sit second in their World Cup qualifying group, level on nine points with Israel but six behind leaders Norway, who hold a 16-goal advantage in goal difference. Only the group winner secures automatic qualification, leaving Italy to realistically aim for a play-off spot. The team has failed to reach the knockout stage of a World Cup since winning it in 2006, and missed out entirely in 2022 despite being reigning European champions.With four remaining matches, including a crucial San Siro clash against Norway, Italy must win all remaining games while hoping for slip-ups from Erling Haaland’s side to top the group. The external political pressure, coupled with the crucial stakes on the field, has made Gattuso’s task more challenging than ever, as Italy fight to keep their World Cup dreams alive.",Italy face Israel in World Cup qualifier in Udine next Tuesday.

Poll Do you think hosting La Liga matches outside Europe is a positive development for football? Yes, it's a great opportunity for global exposure. No, it undermines the league's traditions.

In a landmark decision, Barcelona will play Villarreal in Miami on December 20, marking the first European league fixture to be held outside Europe, La Liga announced on Wednesday. The match will take place at Florida’s Hard Rock Stadium, originally scheduled to be played at Villarreal’s home ground.La Liga president Javier Tebas called the move a historic step for Spanish football.“With this match we take a historic step that projects La Liga and Spanish football into a new dimension,” Tebas said. “We understand and respect the concerns that this decision may generate, but it is important to put it into context — it is a single match out of the 380 that make up the season.”While the move is groundbreaking, it has faced criticism. UEFA , the European football governing body, earlier expressed opposition to overseas league games but allowed this one on an exceptional basis. Real Madrid, Barcelona’s arch-rivals, also voiced disapproval, warning that playing a La Liga game abroad could “alter the competitive balance” and set an “unacceptable precedent.”Fan reaction has been mixed. In September, 18 supporter groups from both clubs expressed complete opposition to the match being held abroad.To ease concerns, Villarreal has announced measures to compensate season ticket holders.“Season ticket holders will be able to travel for free to the match, and those who choose not to travel to Miami will enjoy a 30 percent discount on their season ticket price as part of the measures designed to reward their support and loyalty,” La Liga said.La Liga has previously attempted to host matches overseas dating back to 2017, but faced resistance from the Spanish football federation (RFEF), despite successfully staging the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia.The December 20 fixture between Barcelona and Villarreal represents a historic moment for European football, as the league seeks to expand its global reach, despite concerns over tradition, competitive fairness, and fan sentiment. The match in Miami will undoubtedly be watched closely as a potential blueprint for the future of European club football abroad.",Barcelona will play Villarreal in Miami on December 20.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor. Massive congratulations. You are the future of this sport.”Recalling Barnard’s maiden pole, a fan also wrote, “Fantastic season, Taylor, we'll never forget that Monaco pole.”Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Barnard claimed five podiums in his first full season in Formula E.

Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

Aryna Sabalenka advanced to her 11th semi-final of 2023 by defeating Elena Rybakina 6-3, 6-3 at the Wuhan Open on Friday. In a surprising upset, Jasmine Paolini defeated Iga Swiatek in a quick 65-minute match.Sabalenka, currently ranked world number one, maintains an undefeated record of 20-0 at this tournament and will face Jessica Pegula in Saturday's semi-final.Coco Gauff secured her spot in the semi-finals for the second consecutive year with a 6-3, 6-0 victory over Laura Siegemund. She will compete against Italy's seventh seed Paolini, who achieved her first-ever victory against Swiatek after six previous losses, winning 6-1, 6-2.Sabalenka, the defending champion and recent US Open winner, improved her head-to-head record against Rybakina to 8-5.""Elena is a great player, very nice girl and always tough to play against. We have a really huge history against each other, always great battles. She always pushes me to the limit to get the win. I'm super happy with the performance today,"" the US Open winner said.In temperatures exceeding 30C, Sabalenka secured a crucial break in the eighth game to win the first set in 43 minutes.She continued her momentum in the second set, breaking twice to establish a 4-1 lead.Rybakina managed to recover one break but couldn't prevent Sabalenka from reaching the semi-finals and extending her winning streak to 10 matches.Pegula achieved her 50th win of the season by defeating Katerina Siniakova 2-6, 6-0, 6-3, marking her third consecutive semi-final appearance.""I guess I'm in really good shape. I definitely don't think I need to play any more matches or work on any physical stuff because I've been able to battle through these matches and play very well,"" she added.""Obviously I wish maybe it was more straightforward for my mental and physical state.

She won her match against Siegemund in 85 minutes, successfully converting five out of eight break points.""I think I had chances in the first set to even have a greater lead, so I think I just capitalised more on those chances in the second set,"" said Gauff.","Aryna Sabalenka defeated Elena Rybakina in straight sets.

Chinese tennis fans have created unique nicknames for international tennis stars based on Chinese language homophonic syllables, as revealed during the ongoing tennis tournaments in Shanghai in October 2025. These nicknames, often derived from puns and transliterations of players' names into Chinese, range from animals to food items and reflect the creative way Chinese fans engage with their favorite athletes.World number one Carlos Alcaraz has been dubbed ""Duck"" by Chinese fans who see a resemblance between his facial features, particularly his mouth, and those of a duck-billed platypus. Novak Djokovic , the 24-time Grand Slam champion, carries the nickname ""Chicken"" or ""De Ji"" in Chinese. The name originated when he was at his peak, as ""hot chicken"" in Chinese describes a new sensation, while ""De Ji"" mimics the ""DJ"" sound in his surname.Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka has earned multiple nicknames in China. She's known as ""China's Daughter"" due to her strong performances and popularity in the country. Fans also call her ""Tiger Girl,"" referencing her birth year 1998 (Year of the Tiger) and her tiger tattoo.Additionally, she's dubbed the ""Fried Rice Queen"" because of her proclaimed love for the dish.World number two Iga Swiatek is known as ""Silk Socks"" because ""si wa"" in Mandarin resembles the ""Swia"" in her surname.Amanda Anisimova, the China Open champion, has been nicknamed ""Medicine Sister"" as her surname sounds similar to the Chinese word for the antibiotic Amoxicillin. Madison Keys is simply known as ""Key Sister.""Jessica Pegula and Emma Navarro have been given wealth-related nicknames. Pegula is called ""Dafu"" meaning ""Big Rich,"" while Navarro is known as ""Second Rich,"" both references to their billionaire family backgrounds.Daniil Medvedev has earned the nickname ""Prime Minister"" due to sharing a surname with former Russian premier Dmitry Medvedev. Alexander Zverev, world number three, is named after a princess called ""Ziwei"" from a popular TV drama, as it sounds similar to his surname in Chinese. Roger Federer , though retired, maintains his popularity in China with the nickname ""Cow."" This name originated from receiving two cows as gifts at a Swiss tournament - Juliette in 2003 and Desiree in 2013. Chinese fans also associate his gentle and mellow personality with that of a cow.The nicknaming tradition demonstrates how Chinese fans have creatively adapted foreign players' names into their language, creating meaningful and often humorous connections with the athletes.","Chinese tennis fans have created unique nicknames for international tennis stars based on Chinese language homophonic syllables.

(Getty Images)

WUHAN: Jasmine Paolini’s ringlets are pulled back in a tight top knot that opens out like a crown. Her eyes out sparkle the lights and her laugh is ready. The 29-year-old is joie de vivre on two legs.The Italian enjoyed a breakthrough 2024, up until when she was better known on the doubles court. There may have been a hint of what was to come when she started the season strong, making the fourth round of the Australian Open. Her first time in the second week of a Grand Slam, which took her ranking up to a career-high No.24. In the summer, Paolini made back-to-back major finals at the French Open and Wimbledon and later lodged herself in the top-five at No.4.If what the 5 ft 4’ pro achieved in 2024 was memorable, her effort in making a case for players not in the 5 ft 9 and above height bracket is equally significant. Which is why the back-up season (2025), where she made the fourth round of a Grand Slam just once, yet managed to stay in the top-10 has been revelatory.“I always say that if you keep your level, you are going down. You have to improve, keep improving,” Paolini told TOI on the sidelines of Dongfeng-Voyah Wuhan Open, gesturing with her right hand to make a point.The Italian, ranked No.8 in singles and in the top-five in doubles, is the shortest player in the top-10. American Jessica Pegula at 5 ft 7 is closest to her in height.Marta Kostyuk, the 5 ft 9’ Ukrainian, spoke about how she struggles when standing next to some of the 6-footers on the WTA Tour.“If Marta said that, imagine me,” Paolini said with a laugh. “When I'm playing against them, I see that they are taller than me, but when you come to the net for the coin toss or to shake hands, you see the difference even more. When they are down the other end, you are not thinking about it much.”Paolini, however, has learnt to be kinder to herself.‘Sometimes, when I don’t serve well, I tell myself I'm 163 (cms),” she says, “So compared to people that are 160 in height, I'm serving not that bad.”Paolini points at the robust Italian system –a layered tournament structure and advanced coaching levels -- available to players for her rise in the singles. Italy has eight WTA 125 tournaments, where local players have an opportunity for wildcards into the main draw.Italian tennis is enjoying its best days with Jannik Sinner and Lorenzo Musetti in the top-10 of the ATP Rankings.Any talk of Sinner, hugely popular in Italy, sees Paolini’s eyes light up.She recalls an incident from last year when her former coach Renzo Furlan was in conversation with Sinner. “Jannik told my coach that I was not doing ‘something’ on the court,” she says, breaking into giggles when asked what exactly the world No.2 had suggested she do to improve her game. “I can’t say that then my opponents will know! But when my coach came to me and told me, see Jannik also said, I’m like, if Jannik said…’she finishes throwing back her head and opening out her palms.Paolini said Sinner is seen as a role model among the young in Italy.“He's doing unbelievable things on the court. People like him a lot. How he's behaving on and off the court, he's a really nice guy,” she said. “He’s good role model and that’s very good for our sport in Italy.”For the women it is Paolini who is taking things forward.The 29-year-old says the difference in her life after her success last year is that people recognise her in Italy. She argues that while the two Grand Slam finals were a huge high for her personally, it was the Olympic gold, which she claimed playing alongside Sara Errani, that won her the greatest appreciation among her countrymen.“After the gold medal things were different,” she says, “ People were watching this on the news, the TV. So everybody recognized me. When you do some good results in Grand Slams, it is just tennis fans that are watching. But the gold medal is something all Italians were watching. “This year she emerged triumphant at the Rome Masters, a site she frequented as a child along with her father Ugo.Doubles for Paolini is a play that keeps her in the competition. It helps steady the ship when things are not going her way in singles.“It's a coincidence that I started to play better in singles when I started to play well in doubles,” the Italian said. “Sometimes it's good because you don't play well in singles, but you have the chance to stay in the tournament, it keeps you in the competition.”The last couple of years has been a great balancing act for the little Italian and she has done well to stay on top of things.",Jasmine Paolini is ranked No.8 in singles and in the top-five in doubles.

'Going to be a battle'

Daniil Medvedev on Wednesday got his revenge against US teenager Learner Tien, beating him in a nail-biter 7-6 (8/6), 6-7 (1/7), 6-4 to proceed to the Shanghai Masters quarter-finals.There he will meet world number seven Alex de Minaur, who cruised past Portugal's Nuno Borges 7-5, 6-2 earlier in the day.Victory in Shanghai comes just over a week after the 36th-ranked Tien took the Russian out of the China Open semi-finals in Beijing.""He's an unbelievable tennis player,"" Medvedev said of the 19-year-old. ""Outside of the big three, he may be the toughest opponent I've ever faced.""Medvedev broke first in the ninth game, but Tien returned the favour immediately.The last two games of the first set saw the two players locked in an epic back-and-forth, their prolonged rallies thrilling the crowd.Both faced breakpoint but managed to hold, with Medvedev smashing a looping lob from Tien to send them to a gripping tiebreak.Medvedev broke early in the second set, but Tien was again unphased -- breaking back in the fifth and then seventh games, before the former world number one levelled in the tenth.Medvedev began limping just before the second-set tiebreak and spoke briefly with a medic before hobbling back onto court.Tien went 3-0 up as the Russian, ten years his senior, tried to stretch out on court, becoming increasingly irate as the match was pushed to a decider.""I should be more calm, but Learner drives me nuts... I lost two very traumatic matches against him -- so for sure I was scared to lose again,"" he said.But a scrappy third set -- full of double-faults from both players -- was settled when Medvedev broke in the ninth game with a backhand.The Russian said he would need to rest his legs in anticipation of a similarly tough challenge against De Minaur on Friday, smiling wryly: ""We're gonna run again"".After Novak Djokovic , the Australian is the highest ranked player left standing after a string of high-profile exits.De Minaur needed five break points in the 11th game against Borges in the first set, converting the last with a backhand for a decisive advantage.He carried the momentum into the second set, breaking in the first and third games.But he remained cautious about his title chances.""In our side of the draw, there's a lot of quality players, so it's still going to be a battle,"" he said.Another top-10 player fell on Wednesday as Italy's Lorenzo Musetti lost to Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-4, 6-2.Thirteenth-ranked Auger-Aliassime looked sharp throughout, breaking in the fifth game.He went on to dominate the second set, breaking Musetti, the world number nine, in the fifth and seventh games.""I knew it was going to be the toughest match of the week so far, and I knew I was going to have to raise my level, and I did,"" said the 25-year-old Canadian.He will next meet France's Arthur Rinderknech, who reached his first Masters 1000 quarter-final after beating Czech Jiri Lehecka 6-3, 7-6 (7/5).Rinderknech's cousin Valentin Vacherot made it to the last eight on Tuesday, and will face Denmark's Holger Rune for a place in the semi-finals.Djokovic will follow them on to court on Thursday against Belgium's Zizou Bergs for a place in the last four.","Daniil Medvedev beats Learner Tien 7-6, 6-7 (1/7), 6-4 in Shanghai Masters quarter-finals.

Hardik Pandya and a 'special' pendant: The T20 World Cup dream of Italy's Thomas Draca,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/hardik-pandya-and-a-special-pendant-the-t20-world-cup-dream-of-italys-thomas-draca-exclusive/articleshow/128094609.cms,"Thomas Draca (Image credit: Special arrangements)

Team India lands in New Delhi for T20 World Cup match

A 'SPECIAL' PENDANT

NEW DELHI: When the legendary Sachin Tendulkar retired, he left the crowd with a piece of timeless advice: “Chase your dreams, they do come true.” For Italy allrounder Thomas Draca, one long-cherished dream is now within reach — meeting his idol, Hardik Pandya , during the T20 World Cup. On the field, whether with bat or ball, Draca strives to mirror Pandya’s intensity and fearless approach to the game.But his admiration doesn’t stop at cricketing skills alone. Draca also tries to emulate Pandya’s energy and demeanor off the field, reflecting the all-rounder’s professionalism and charisma in his own conduct.""It's my dream to play alongside him [Hardik Pandya]. I don’t really look forward to playing against him or bowling to him, but if we qualify and I get the chance to play against him or meet him, it would be an incredible experience. He’s someone I’ve always looked up to and model my game after. I’m an all-rounder too, and I really admire the way he approaches the game — the way he engages with the public and carries himself in the media. That’s something I try to emulate now,"" Draca told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""Matching his energy is tough — he’s always on top of his game. If I can mirror that as I progress, I think I’ll be on the right path for a good career.I’d love to chat with him, get some tips. He seems like such a nice guy and has been one of my heroes growing up. I love how he plays fearlessly, takes on the contest with both bat and ball, and that’s what I’m trying to do myself. If I can do a little of that, I’ll know I’m heading in the right direction,"" he added.Italy, a nation long celebrated for its football domination, is set to make its maiden appearance on the T20 World Cup stage. The Azzurri find themselves in a challenging group alongside Scotland, West Indies, Nepal, and England.Despite the stiff competition, 25-year-old Draca remains confident about Italy’s chances of progressing to the Super Eights, eager to make a mark on the global stage; meet his idol Pandya and ask him the questions he has already noted in his travel diary.""One thing I’d ask him is how much his watch is worth — he’s wearing a Royal Oak! (laughs) Just kidding. I’d also ask about his variations, especially in the back end of the innings. I really like his off-cutter and knuckleball, so I’d probably ask him about those,"" he said.""Then, I’d just have a chat and try to pick his brain. Whether it’s for five seconds or five minutes, I don’t care — we’ll see how long the conversation goes,"" Draca added with a smile.The 25-year-old Draca has been honing his skills under the guidance of legends Dennis Lillee and Carlos Brathwaite.Lillee has been mentoring him in the art of pace bowling, while Brathwaite, famous for hitting four successive sixes off Ben Stokes in the final over of the 2016 T20 World Cup to secure the title for West Indies, has been shaping his all-round game.""I was fortunate to meet Carlos Brathwaite during a franchise stint. Over the past year and a half, he’s really taken me under his wing. I’ve flown to Barbados multiple times to work out with his S&C coach, Jamar. He’s invested a lot of time in my cricket. Carlos always tells me to stay calm and be myself on the pitch. Don’t worry about the pressure — just enjoy the game. That mindset has really helped me stay relaxed, focus on my plans, and perform,"" Draca said.""I’ve also got Dennis Lillee as a mentor. He guided me when I was 17, helping me through rehab and teaching me discipline both on and off the field. He even gave me his World Series chain to wear during the World Cup, which is an incredible inspiration. I know I’ll be emotional the first time I put it on,"" he added.""Having that chain around my neck reminds me of the belief these greats have in me. It gives me the confidence to keep things simple, bowl fast, enjoy the game, and perform for my country,"" Draca said.","Thomas Draca wants to meet idol Hardik Pandya during the T20 World Cup.

T20 World Cup: 'God changed my destiny' - Mohammed Siraj on emotions of lucky comeback

Speculation around the equation between India head coach Gautam Gambhir and senior batter Virat Kohli has refused to die down ever since Gambhir took charge of the national side. Their well-documented on-field run-ins during the Indian Premier League have continued to fuel chatter within the cricketing community, with suggestions that the two are still not entirely on the same page.Those claims, however, have now been firmly dismissed by BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia, who rubbished reports of any ongoing tension between the two high-profile figures.“I have never seen them ( Kohli and Gambhir) fighting. They are in a very good cordial relationship,” Saikia said while speaking on the India Today podcast.Referring to their IPL history, Saikia added, “IPL? Maybe I didn’t see that match because I was with them when they were representing the country.”Gambhir’s tenure as head coach has coincided with significant phases in Kohli’s career. The former India captain announced his retirement from Test cricket in 2025, a decision that sparked widespread debate. More recently, Kohli’s place in India’s ODI plans for the 2027 World Cup has also been scrutinised, though much of that discussion has eased due to his outstanding run of form.At 37, Kohli is enjoying what many believe to be one of the richest purple patches of his ODI career, having struck three centuries and a score of 93 in his last six appearances for India.Questions around the Gambhir-Kohli relationship have also been linked to the BCCI’s tougher stance on senior players featuring in domestic competitions when not on international duty. Over the past year, Kohli returned to both the Ranji Trophy and the Vijay Hazare Trophy after long absences.Despite persistent rumours of friction, Gambhir and Kohli have already combined successfully at the highest level, playing key roles in India’s Champions Trophy triumph in 2025, an ICC title that underlined unity rather than discord within the setup.","Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli's relationship has been the subject of persistent speculation.

MUMBAI: It was a ‘Himalayan effort’ by the Himalayan kingdom. Nestled between India and China (Tibet), Nepal, a landlocked South Asian nation, is famous for its beautiful landscape, which includes 10 of the highest peaks on earth, including Mount Everest.Judging by the way they began their campaign in the 2026 T20 World Cup on Sunday, with both their talented team and enthusiastic fans stealing the show, Nepal will now also be known as a cricketing nation.Chasing 185, they finished on 180 for 6 in 20 overs, falling just one hit short of what would have been one of the biggest upsets in T20 World Cup history. Nepal needed 10 off the last six balls with Lokesh Bam on 39 not out off 20 balls, but Curran held his nerve with yorkers and fuller deliveries and conceded only five runs and did not allow a boundary.Curran returned 1-27 in four overs. Jofra Archer conceded 1-42 in four overs, while Adil Rashid went for 0-42 in three overs.Nepal’s chase gathered momentum when they took 22 off the 18th over bowled by Archer, with Aarif Sheikh hitting a six and then Lokesh striking two more. Lokesh struck two fours off Luke Wood, but Wood struck a key blow off the last ball when he dislodged the off stump of Gulsan Jha with a crossseam yorker.For England, Jacks, adjudged Player of the Match, helped them add 45 off the final three overs. Batting at No 7, he made 39 not out off 21 balls with four sixes and one four. Three of those sixes came in the final over as he hit Karan KC for 21 off the last six balls. With the ball, Jacks took 1-17 in two overs and dismissed Kushal Bhurtel, who made 29 off 17 balls with four fours and one six, caught off his own bowling.After Bhurtel’s dismissal, Nepal captain Rohit Paudel scored 39 off 34 balls with two fours and two sixes, while Dipendra Singh Airee hit 44 off 29 balls with six fours and one six. They added 82 runs for the fifth wicket in 54 balls.Earlier, England elected to bat first and made 184-7. Jacob Bethell scored 55 off 35 balls with four fours and four sixes, while captain Harry Brook made 53 off 32 balls with four fours and three sixes.England were 57 for 3 before Brook and Bethell added 71 for the fourth wicket off 45 balls.Nepal struck early when Phil Salt was caught at short fine leg off off-spinner Sher Malla, making his T20I debut, on the first ball of Malla’s second over.Nepal’s fielders held all their catches, while Airee took 2-24 in four overs, Yadav 2-25 in four overs and Lamichhane 1-25 in four overs.Nepal’s fans formed a majority of the 17,008 crowd at the Wankhede and included supporters who travelled from Kathmandu and London.Wearing blue jerseys with a dash of red, they cheered Nepal’s boundaries, and after the match Nepal’s players took a lap of the ground to acknowledge the support. Jos Buttler has become the fourth batter to complete 1000+ runs in T20 World Cup — his tally being 1039 at an average of 41.56 in 35 innings. He has joined Virat Kohli (1292), Rohit Sharma (1220) and Mahela Jayawardene (1016).",England beat Nepal by six wickets in 2026 T20 World Cup.

Special dinner for Team India at Gautam Gambhir’s house in Delhi | T20 World Cup

KOLKATA: There is a muted curiosity around the Italian cricket team. Even though the usual buzz that surrounds an international cricket match here at the Eden Gardens is missing, a tiny number of faithful did fetch up at this iconic stadium when the Italians landed for a practice session on Sunday afternoon. They will take on Scotland here on Monday, in their maiden T20 World Cup match and skipper Wayne Madsen admits there will obviously be some butterflies in the stomach.“We had a good preparation and some great practice matches,” he said before getting down to a session in the nets. “But the real thing starts now.” The fact that they are in the World Cup sunk in when the tournament started on Saturday. “The boys are excited and they just want to go out there and play.” It helps that Scotland are their first opponents, a team they know quite well. “We have played them a number of times and we know quite a bit about them,” Madsen added.It also perhaps helps that Scotland, a last-minute entry into the World Cup, might not be all that well prepared. A loss to West Indies on Saturday would have left them a little low.“We saw that game and gathered our points,” coach John Davison, a former Canada cricketer best known for his 67-ball century against the West Indies in the 2003 50-over World Cup, said.“The wicket looks pretty good for batting.”Incidentally, Italy do not have any natural grass turf wicket.“We play on artificial wickets,” Davison said. So, they have a number of adjustments to make: the surface, the atmosphere and the crowd. An official admitted that back home, they are accustomed to playing in front of spectators in single digits!Given that they won both their practice games against Canada and UAE in Chennai, as well as one game against Ireland in Dubai, their confidence will be quite high. A win against Scotland on Monday would be a dream start to their journey in cricket’s big league.","Italy take on Scotland in their maiden T20 World Cup match on Monday.

T20 World Cup Groups Explained: Who Can Reach the Super 8

Sri Lanka began their ICC Men’s T20 World Cup campaign on a confident note, overcoming Ireland by 20 runs in their opening fixture on Sunday, thanks to a composed unbeaten half-century from Kamindu Mendis and a clinical display from their spinners.Asked to bat first, the hosts were rocked early when Mark Adair removed Kamil Mishara for six in the fourth over. Despite the early setback, Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis ensured Sri Lanka finished the powerplay on solid footing, taking the score to 50 with a blend of caution and timely aggression.The partnership added 34 for the second wicket before George Dockrell broke through in the ninth over, dismissing Nissanka for 24 off 23 balls. Dockrell struck again soon after, sending Pavan Rathnayake back for 5, leaving Sri Lanka wobbling at 68 for three after 11 overs. Ireland tightened the screws through the middle phase, drying up the boundaries and forcing Sri Lanka to crawl to 95 for four by the 15th over.The momentum shifted dramatically thereafter. Kamindu Mendis and Kusal Mendis counter-attacked with a vital 67-run stand that revived the innings.Kamindu changed the complexion of the match with a blistering burst, smashing 44 off just 19 balls, before settling into a mature unbeaten 56 off 43 deliveries. His knock guided Sri Lanka to a competitive total of 163.In reply, Ireland lost skipper Paul Stirling early, trapped by Maheesh Theekshana in the fourth over. Ross Adair showed intent but was bowled by Wanindu Hasaranga for 34, while a promising 49-run stand between Harry Tector and Lorcan Tucker briefly kept Ireland in the hunt.Sri Lanka’s spinners then took control. Hasaranga removed Tector for 40 and Dunith Wellalage accounted for Tucker, triggering a collapse. Theekshana struck twice late to seal the contest as Ireland were bowled out for 143.Maheesh Theekshana and Wanindu Hasaranga claimed three wickets apiece, underlining Sri Lanka’s all-round dominance.",Sri Lanka beat Ireland by 20 runs in their opening T20 World Cup match.

Barcelona confirmed on Saturday that it has withdrawn from the European Super League project, leaving Real Madrid as the only club still involved.""Barcelona hereby announces that today it has formally notified the European Super League Company and the clubs involved of its withdrawal from the European Super League project,"" said the Catalans in a statement.Barcelona president Joan Laporta said in October 2025 that the club wanted to rebuild its relationship with UEFA and move away from the project launched by 12 clubs in 2021, which collapsed after strong opposition from fans and football authorities.Soon after the Super League was announced five years ago, the six English clubs involved—Manchester City, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United, Tottenham and Chelsea—withdrew.They were later followed by Atletico Madrid, Inter Milan, AC Milan and Juventus by 2024, leaving only Barcelona and Real Madrid still part of the project supported by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez.""We are in favour of peace because there is a way forward for the clubs in the Super League to return to UEFA,"" said Barca chief Laporta in October.""We feel very close to UEFA and the EFC (European Football Clubs, a sole, independent body representing football clubs within Europe).""In 2024, a Spanish court ruled that opposition to the Super League from FIFA and UEFA had limited free competition.

Barcelona strengthened their grip on the La Liga title race with a commanding 3-0 victory over Mallorca on Saturday, opening up a four-point lead at the top of the table. Teenage sensation Lamine Yamal played a central role, responding to an earlier miss with a stunning long-range finish that underlined his growing influence. Robert Lewandowski set Barça on their way in the first half before 18-year-old academy graduate Marc Bernal wrapped up the points late on with the first goal of his senior career. The result gives Barcelona breathing space at the summit, although second-placed Real Madrid have the chance to cut the deficit to a single point when they travel to Valencia on Sunday.Lewandowski broke the deadlock in the 29th minute, reacting quickest after Marcus Rashford’s initial effort down the left was blocked. The striker calmly brought the ball under control, shifted it away from a defender and finished with precision from close range.Rashford’s growing confidence was evident again just before the interval. His curling free kick in stoppage time forced an excellent save from Mallorca goalkeeper Leo Roman. The rebound dropped invitingly for Jules Koundé inside the area, but his mishit effort fell to Yamal, who surprisingly failed to convert from virtually on the goal line.Lewandowski, one of the game’s most prolific scorers with more than 650 club goals to his name, was quick to encourage the young winger after the miss. Yamal made amends in emphatic fashion in the 61st minute. Skipping past a defender on the edge of the box, he unleashed a fierce, dipping left-footed strike into the bottom corner, leaving Roman rooted to the spot.Both Yamal and Lewandowski were substituted later in the match and watched on approvingly as Bernal added the third in the 83rd minute. Barcelona cut through Mallorca’s midfield with a sharp passing move that released the teenager, who showed impressive composure to glide past a defender and slot the ball neatly inside the post.Elsewhere in La Liga, two fixtures were postponed. Rayo Vallecano’s home clash with Oviedo was called off due to safety concerns over the pitch at Vallecas Stadium, while Sevilla’s match against Girona was also postponed because of adverse weather. Oviedo said it understood the decision but criticised the late notice and confirmed it was considering legal action.",Barcelona beat Mallorca 3-0 to move four points clear at the top of La Liga.

NEW DELHI: Few clubs in Indian football have risen as swiftly or as symbolically as Real Kashmir FC. From their debut season to becoming consistent contenders in the Indian Football League (IFL), the Srinagar-based club has carved out a reputation for resilience and ambition. Yet, as the upcoming I-League season prepares to kick off on Feb 21, the Snow Leopards find themselves navigating a familiar terrain of uncertainty both on and off the pitch.Real Kashmir, back-to-back IFA Shield winners (2020 and 2021), have finished among the top five six times in I-League in the seven seasons they have competed. However, the postponement of the season has created significant logistical and financial challenges, not just for Real Kashmir but for clubs across the league.Club owner Arshad Shawl, who took over as part of the leadership group in 2019, candidly said that the turmoil is the result of a system that leaned too heavily on a single private entity for over a decade.“You have to understand the ecosystem of Indian football over the last 15 years,” Shawl told TOI. “When that private support was pulled out, there was no contingency plan in place.”With the All India Football Federation (AIFF) under financial strain, I-League clubs have been forced to absorb much of the operational burden themselves.For Real Kashmir, the challenge is compounded by geography and climate. Pre-season preparations in sub-zero temperatures, coupled with an an uncertain calendar, have made the task even tougher.“Starting this season is like starting a frozen engine in minus temperatures and asking it to run a rally,” Shawl added.Despite the obstacles, the club’s philosophy stays firmly rooted in local identity. Real Kashmir have consistently prioritised Kashmiri players and home grown talent, a vision reflected in the appointment of former India international and Kashmir native Ishfaq Ahmed as head coach. Under his guidance, the club has become a platform for local footballers to dream bigger. “This club has put Kashmir on the front pages for a happier reason,” Shawl said. “It allowed the world to look at Kashmir through the lens of football.”Beyond the first team, Real Kashmir has invested in a structured youth development, blending local prospects with experienced Indian and overseas players. A capable backroom staff supports the squad.”What continues to hold the club back, Shawl insists, is beyond its control. “We are doing everything that we can control,” he said, pointing to ownership stability, player commitment, and grass roots development.","Real Kashmir have been consistent contenders in the Indian Football League (IFL) The Snow Leopards have finished among the top five six times in the seven seasons they have competed.

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola will ask the English Football League for permission to play Marc Guehi in the League Cup final against Arsenal, even though the defender is currently not eligible.Guehi joined City from Crystal Palace in January but was not allowed to play in the semi-final win over Newcastle.Guehi cannot play in the League Cup this season because he joined the club after the first leg of the semi-final.Another January signing, Antoine Semenyo, is eligible, as he was registered earlier in the competition.Guardiola, aware of his team’s defensive problems this season and Arsenal’s threat, plans to ask for Guehi’s inclusion.""Why should he not play? Why not?"" Guardiola said. ""He's our player, we pay his salary, we hired him.""We want to ask. I said to the club we have to ask definitely.

Super Bowl Trophy Cost revealed: How expensive the Vince Lombardi Trophy really is,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/super-bowl-trophy-cost-revealed-how-expensive-the-vince-lombardi-trophy-really-is/articleshow/128098593.cms,"Super Bowl Trophy Cost revealed: How expensive the Vince Lombardi Trophy really is (Getty)

Super Bowl trophy cost is around $50,000 and requires months of handcrafted work

Every Super Bowl ends with the same moment. The reigning team lifts the Lombardi Trophy as confetti falls. Folks see the shine on TV, but most know the efforts it takes to craft that incredible silver prize.Behind that grand celebration lies months of hard work and actual costs. The Lombardi Trophy is not mass-produced. Skilled craftsmen build it by hand each season, which is why its price tag remains high every year.The Vince Lombardi Trophy costs about $50,000 to produce. That figure comes up often in reports that track Super Bowl history and NFL memorabilia. The price reflects the premium material and the detailed handwork required for each edition.Tiffany & Co. has produced the NFL trophy since the first Super Bowl. The partnership began in 1966 when Tiffany executive Oscar Riedener sketched the original design during a meeting with then-NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle. The league named the trophy after Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi in 1970, after his death, adding deeper meaning to the award.The trophy is made of sterling silver. That metal gives the piece its bright finish and durability, but it also increases the base cost.Craftsmen shape the silver by hand, polish every surface, and check the finish before the Super Bowl each year.The build process takes time. It usually spans about four months, with dozens of hours of direct labor from experienced silversmiths. That slow, careful approach ensures every trophy looks flawless on the biggest stage in American sports.Regarding its stunning design, the Trophy stands about 22 inches tall and weighs close to 7 pounds. A football in a kicking position sits on a three-sided base. The clean look has stayed almost unchanged for decades, which makes the trophy instantly recognizable the moment it appears on the field.Another key factor raises the cost. The NFL creates a new trophy all season, and the winning team keeps it permanently. After the game, artisans engrave the champion’s name, the Super Bowl number, and the date. That step turns the trophy into a one-of-a-kind keepsake tied to that specific title run.Add it all up, and the $50,000 figure makes sense. Sterling silver, months of hard work, and a fresh build every year add up to the final price. That mix of tradition and perfect work is exactly why lifting the Lombardi Trophy remains the grand moment of any Super Bowl night.","Tiffany & Co. has produced the NFL trophy since the first Super Bowl.

Kenneth Walker III proves why he deserved Super Bowl MVP after Seahawks grand win

All week, the buzz around Super Bowl LX stayed locked on quarterbacks. Big arms, heavy throws, and remarkable moments. Then the game kicked off on Feb 8, 2026, and the script flipped pretty fast. Instead of a shootout, it turned into a grind.That grind favored Seattle. Kenneth Walker III kept the offense moving, play after play, while the Patriots struggled to find answers. By the final whistle at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, the Seahawks had a 29–13 win, their second Lombardi Trophy, and Walker stood out as the clear difference maker.Right from the first half, Seattle leaned into the run. Walker rewarded that trust with tough yards and smart reads. While both teams opened slowly, he gave the Seahawks steady field position and kept drives alive.Soon enough, the big plays showed up. Walker broke off runs of 29 and 30 yards during a key stretch, flipping momentum and setting up scoring chances when points were tough to get. That burst helped Seattle build early control instead of chasing the game.By halftime, Walker had already piled up 94 rushing yards, one of the strongest first-half rushing totals in Super Bowl history . That early push compelled New England to play catch-up, which played right into Seattle’s plan to control the clock.He finished the night with 135 rushing yards on 27 carries and added 26 receiving yards. Those numbers told part of the story, but the timing mattered more. Whenever Seattle needed a steady gain or a tough conversion, the ball kept finding Walker.Meanwhile, the Seahawks defense backed the effort with constant pressure and limited scoring chances. Kicker Jason Myers kept adding points with five made field goals, stretching the lead bit by bit. Even with that support, the offense clearly ran through Walker from start to finish.That performance earned him Super Bowl LX MVP honors on February 8, 2026. The moment also carried history. Walker became the first running back to win the award since Terrell Davis did it after the 1997 season. His 135 rushing yards were also the most recorded by any player in a Super Bowl since that same mark.His playoff run made the case even stronger. Walker totalled 313 rushing yards across the postseason and finished just five yards short of Marshawn Lynch’s franchise playoff record from 2014.In a game packed with quarterback hype, Seattle trusted its ground attack instead. That call paid off. Kenneth Walker III controlled the tempo, wore down the defense, and owned the biggest stage.So the answer is simple. The Super Bowl LX MVP is Kenneth Walker III, the Seahawks star who delivered a clutch performance and drove Seattle to a championship win.",Kenneth Walker III is the first running back to win the award since Terrell Davis did it after the 1997 season.

Seattle Seahawks win Super Bowl LX: How the Dark Side Defense decided the title



The Seattle Seahawks's Super Bowl LX victory was sealed on Sunday night at Levi’s Stadium, where Seattle defeated the New England Patriots 29-13 to claim the second championship in franchise history. Eleven years after a painful Super Bowl XLIX loss to the same opponent, the Seahawks flipped the script with authority, delivering a result shaped less by star quarterbacks and more by raw defensive force.This victory also halted New England’s pursuit of a record-breaking seventh Lombardi Trophy. Instead, it marked a moment of long-awaited redemption for Seattle, whose defense answered every lingering question about its place in NFL history. What unfolded was not just a win, but a statement that defense, when designed and executed with clarity, can still rule the sport’s biggest stage.Seattle arrived with purpose and identity. Branded as the Dark Side Defense, the unit entered Super Bowl LX determined to prove it belonged in the same conversation as the famed Legion of Boom. From the opening series, the Seahawks dictated terms, collapsing pockets, closing lanes, and forcing Patriots quarterback Drake Maye into rushed decisions all night.The Seahawks came within one misstep of recording the first defensive shutout in Super Bowl history. That moment slipped away on a single breakdown, when cornerback Riq Woolen failed to read the play quickly enough, allowing Maye to connect for New England’s lone touchdown. It was the only crack in an otherwise relentless performance.Pressure defined the evening. Outside linebacker Derick Hall sparked chaos with a strip sack, recovered by defensive tackle Byron Murphy II. Later, Maye misread coverage again, throwing an interception to Julian Love on a deep cross where the safety never left his sightline. Devon Witherspoon added the defining exclamation point, forcing a strip sack that edge rusher Uchenna Nwosu returned 45 yards for a touchdown.Seattle finished with six sacks, eight tackles for loss, 11 quarterback hits, and three turnovers. Those numbers told only part of the story. The true architect was second-year head coach Mike Macdonald, whose defensive philosophy blended discipline with aggression. At just 38, Macdonald already looks like a defining defensive mind of his generation.This performance did not come out of nowhere. Seattle led the league in scoring defense during the regular season, allowed fewer than 92 rushing yards per game, and consistently suffocated opposing quarterbacks. On the sport’s biggest night, that identity reached its peak.","The Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots 29-13 in Super Bowl LX.

Stefon Diggs’ long wait for a ring ends in fresh heartbreak



The New England Patriots’ dream run ended, and the final moments hit Stefon Diggs the hardest. The veteran WR walked off the field at the end of Super Bowl LX with tears in his eyes after Seattle sealed a 29-13 win. For a player who chased this stage for over a decade, the loss cut deep right away.New England came in riding a strong postseason, but the Seahawks’ defense controlled the night. Drake Maye and the offense could not find a rhythm for most of the game. By the time the Patriots finally broke through with a late touchdown, the gap was already wide. As the confetti fell for Seattle, Diggs stood near the sideline, visibly shaken, knowing another shot at a ring had slipped away.The scene after the final whistle summed up the night. In a video shared, ML Football captured Stefon Diggs, his eyes filled with tears, on the field following Super Bowl LX.The post read, “HEARTBREAKING: #Patriots star WR Stefon Diggs was CRYING while walking off the field after losing the Super Bowl. Diggs still does not have a ring in his career.”That moment carried years of history. Diggs entered the season determined to prove he still belonged among the league’s top receivers.He signed a three- year, $63.5 million deal with New England in the 2025 offseason after his short stint in Houston ended early due to an ACL tear in Week 8 of the previous year. Many questioned if he could return to form.He answered with production and leadership. Diggs finished the 2025 season with 1,013 receiving yards and four touchdowns. He also helped guide a young offense led by Maye. The Patriots went 14-3 in the regular season, won the AFC East, and then beat the Chargers, Texans, and Broncos to reach their first Super Bowl since the Tom Brady era.Diggs had already spoken about how much this run meant after the AFC Championship win over Denver on Feb. 2, 2026, at Empower Field at Mile High. Fighting back tears during the on-field interview, he said, “It made it all worth it, man. All the hard work. We’ve got one more.”That “one more” never came. Instead, Sunday night added another painful chapter. Diggs has now played 11 seasons and still waits for his first ring. For one of the most productive receivers of his era, the image of him leaving the field in tears told the whole story of how close the Patriots came and how much it still hurts.","New England Patriots lost 29-13 to Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX.

JJ Watt’s coin toss joke steals attention during Super Bowl LX

The Super Bowl LX is live, and while the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks battle on the field, JJ Watt is winning the internet. Amid the early moments of the game, the former NFL star’s sharp comment on the coin toss has gone viral, giving fans a much-needed laugh during football’s biggest night.The moment happened right before kickoff at Levi’s Stadium. As the referee raised the coin at midfield, Watt reacted in real time. Posting on X during Super Bowl LX, the CBS Sports analyst wrote, “Ref held the coin up like it was communion at church.” The line spread quickly as the game moved on, with fans sharing it across platforms while the first drives unfolded.The timing made it land even harder. Super Bowl moments already feel larger than life. Every pause feels dramatic. Every gesture feels symbolic. Watt’s comment captured that exact feeling without trying too hard. It was quick, clean, and perfectly placed, which is why it cut through the nonstop game chatter.The coin toss itself favored New England. The Patriots won and chose to defer, setting Seattle up to receive the opening kickoff. It was a routine football decision, yet Watt’s observation turned a standard sequence into one of the night’s early highlights.Watt watched Super Bowl LX from the analyst’s chair, a role he has embraced since retiring after the 2023 season. Now 36, he remains closely tied to the league and often brings humor into serious football moments. This was not planned content. It was a natural reaction that fans instantly related to.There was added context behind his presence. On Jan. 12, 2026, Watt appeared on CBS Sports’ “NFL Today” and backed the Houston Texans to make a Super Bowl run. “The defense is good enough to get to the Super Bowl,” Watt said on the show. That prediction fell short when the Patriots defeated the Texans in the divisional round.Well, today at Levi's Stadium, the New England Patriots won the toss, but Watt’s comment seems louder than the game itself.Now, as New England couldn't win its first Super Bowl title since 2019, Watt’s voice remains part of the night. Even without playing, he found a way to shape the conversation. In a game filled with pressure and history, his joke reminded fans why Super Bowl moments live far beyond the field.","J.J Watt shared hilarious take on Super Bowl LX coin toss.

Seattle Seahawks’s Super Bowl LX win built on defensive authority and timely execution



The Seattle Seahawks are Super Bowl champions for the second time in their history as they beat the New England Patriots 29-13 on Sunday at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Eleven years after a loss to New England that still echoes in franchise memory, the Seahawks authored a far more definitive ending. This time, there was no late-game doubt, no single play to debate. There was only control, sustained over four quarters, and a scoreboard that reflected it.Seattle won because it dictated terms early, absorbed resistance calmly, and tightened its grip as the game matured. The Patriots, chasing a historic seventh Lombardi Trophy, never found oxygen. From the opening series, momentum leaned one way and never fully tilted back.Why did the game turn so firmly in Seattle’s favor. The answer sat at every level of the Seahawks defense, a unit known as “the Dark Side,” which imposed itself from the first snap and refused to bend when field position tightened. New England entered with a defense that thrived on discipline, but it was Seattle that set the tone physically and mentally.The Seahawks offense moved with intent early, advancing deep into Patriots territory on the opening drive before settling for three points. That restraint proved strategic. Rather than forcing plays, Seattle trusted its defense to keep pressure mounting. Kenneth Walker III provided rhythm on the ground, breaking through with explosive runs that flipped field position and wore down pursuit angles. His first-half effort turned short possessions into scoring chances and drained belief from the opposing sideline.Sam Darnold operated with efficiency instead of excess. He avoided risk, extended drives, and delivered when opportunity finally opened. That moment arrived late in the third quarter, after a forced fumble shifted possession. Five plays later, a touchdown pass to AJ Barner stretched the lead and altered the emotional math of the game.From there, the Seahawks defense tightened further. Pressure forced rushed throws. Takeaways followed. A late interception and a fumble return touchdown sealed the result. New England managed a brief response, but it arrived too late and without leverage.Seattle did not chase highlights. It chased certainty. By the final minutes, even a long touchdown run being called back could not change the ending. The Seahawks had already won the game where it mattered most.","Seattle Seahawks beat New England Patriots 29-13 to win Super Bowl XLIX.

Blue Ivy’s signature Super Bowl pose and Rumi’s steady rise continue to spotlight the Carter family

Super Bowl LX was not just another workday for Jay-Z. It also became a family moment that quietly stole attention at Levi’s Stadium. The 25 time Grammy winner attended the game with his daughters Blue Ivy and Rumi Carter as the New England Patriots faced the Seattle Seahawks. While millions watched the action on the field, Jay-Z was seen moving between professional responsibilities and hands on dad duties on one of sport’s biggest stages.As the NFL’s live music entertainment strategist, Jay-Z had every reason to be present. Still, it was his daughters who added a personal layer to the night. Blue Ivy, now 14, confidently posed for cameras on the sidelines, flashing her familiar jump for joy stance. The moment felt like a callback to earlier Super Bowl appearances, turning a simple pose into a tradition fans now recognize instantly.Blue Ivy’s Super Bowl pose has become a recurring highlight over the years. She struck the same stance at Super Bowl LIV in 2020 and again at Super Bowl LIX last season. This year felt different, though, with younger sister Rumi right beside her. At just eight years old, Rumi is still new to these high profile settings, but she looked comfortable taking it all in.The sisters’ Super Bowl appearance followed a busy year that pushed them further into public view. Both were special guests during the Cowboy Carter Tour headlined by their mother, Beyoncé. For Blue Ivy, it marked her second time touring with Beyoncé. For Rumi, it was her first taste of the stage. Fans frequently saw her join her mom and older sister during performances of the Cowboy Carter track “My Rose,” a moment that quickly became a fan favorite.Since the tour wrapped, Blue Ivy’s role has grown in ways that go beyond performing. In December, Beyoncé acknowledged her daughter’s involvement by selling “Blue Ivy Management” hoodies on her official website. The gesture sparked conversation online and highlighted how naturally Blue has stepped into leadership around her mother’s projects.Jay-Z and Beyoncé also share an eight year old son, Sir Carter, Rumi’s twin. Together, the Carter family continues to blend music, culture, and major sports moments, turning even Super Bowl Sunday into a snapshot of their evolving legacy.","Jay-Z attended the Super Bowl with his daughters Blue Ivy and Rumi Carter.

Trey Wingo ’s coin toss stat brings back uncomfortable Super Bowl memories

The New England Patriots entered Super Bowl LX carrying the underdog label once again. Lined up against the Seattle Seahawks, New England opened the night as 4.5 point underdogs, a reflection of how differently the two teams’ seasons were perceived. Seattle battled through a difficult regular season and looked sharper with every playoff game, while the Patriots were still viewed as a team searching for consistency despite their AFC title run.New England’s playoff path showed resilience rather than dominance. They defeated strong opponents and handled pressure well, but doubts remained about how the offense would respond on the biggest stage. That skepticism only grew minutes before kickoff when the Patriots won the opening coin toss, triggering an unexpected reminder from NFL history that quickly caught fans’ attention.NFL insider Trey Wingo highlighted a pattern that Patriots fans know all too well. “The Patriots won the coin toss. They won the coin toss in all 3 of their Super Bowl losses…and lost the coin toss in all 6 of their Super Bowl wins,” Wingo tweeted on Sunday.The statistic immediately sparked debate because those three losses came during the most successful era in franchise history. New England fell twice to the New York Giants, first in the 2007 season and again in 2011.They later lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII, a game remembered as one of the most entertaining Super Bowls ever played.Early action in Super Bowl LX has not eased the nerves. At the time of writing, the Patriots trail 6 to 0, with Seattle’s defense controlling the tempo. Rookie quarterback Drake Maye has faced steady pressure, forcing New England to play from behind earlier than planned.There is still a long way to go, and Super Bowl history is filled with comebacks and momentum shifts. Still, as the Seahawks continue to dictate the game, Wingo’s coin toss stat feels less like trivia and more like an uneasy reminder hanging over the Patriots’ night.","NFL insider Trey Wingo highlighted a pattern that Patriots fans know all too well.

Lakers drop Luka Doncic's injury status



Lakers GM Rob Pelinka on Luka Doncic's injury



Luka Doncic did not suit up the last time the Los Angeles Lakers took the floor, and his absence immediately shifted attention toward the team’s short term outlook. The six time All-Star missed Saturday’s 105 to 99 win over the Golden State Warriors after picking up a hamstring injury earlier in the week. While the Lakers kept rolling without him, questions followed about his availability with another high profile matchup approaching.The Lakers released their injury report ahead of Monday night’s home game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. With the All Star break approaching and a demanding stretch on the schedule, the franchise revealed where Doncic stands and what the next few days could look like.The Lakers ruled Luka Doncic out again for Monday’s game at Crypto.com Arena as he continues to manage a mild hamstring injury. The issue surfaced late in Thursday’s win over the Philadelphia 76ers, when Doncic exited near the end of the second quarter and did not return. He finished that night with 10 points, four rebounds, and two assists in slightly more than 16 minutes.Initially listed as doubtful against Golden State, the team later shut him down entirely. The latest injury report confirms he remains sidelined, with no firm return date.There is also uncertainty around his status for Wednesday’s matchup against the San Antonio Spurs. If he misses that contest, Thursday’s game against the Dallas Mavericks would become his next possible return before the All Star break.Despite the setback, the Lakers have maintained momentum. They sit at 32 and 19, fifth in the Western Conference, and have won three straight games. With Doncic out, Austin Reaves returned from a calf injury, giving the rotation added stability alongside LeBron James.General manager Rob Pelinka addressed the situation before Saturday’s game, offering reassurance after medical imaging. Per ESPN’s Dave McMenamin, Pelinka said, “In terms of this injury, the good news is it doesn’t appear to be anything serious. It was a mild hamstring strain, and he is truly day-to-day.”Head coach JJ Redick echoed that assessment while explaining the decision to hold Doncic out. “Yeah, he felt some soreness in his hamstring, so he didn’t feel like it was good enough to go back in,” Redick said after the Philadelphia game. “Neither did medical, so we held him out. And he’ll get some imaging. I mean, too early to say if there’s an injury, but just had a sore hamstring.”Further context was provided by Brian Windhorst, who outlined what the diagnosis means moving forward. “It really comes down to, is this a mild strain, a first-degree?” Windhorst said. “If that’s the case, the All-Star break comes next week, and he could be back without missing too many games. If it’s a more serious Grade 2, now you’ve got a bigger problem.”As of now, the Lakers are cautious about Doncic.",The Los Angeles Lakers released their injury report ahead of Monday night’s home game against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Damian Lillard enters the 3-point contest



Why didn’t Damian Lillard play this NBA season ?



Damian Lillard will step back into the national spotlight during NBA All-Star Weekend, even though he has not played a single game this season. The nine-time All-Star is set to compete in Saturday’s 3-point contest in Los Angeles, placing him alongside players who have logged heavy minutes throughout the year. His inclusion immediately draws attention because of his absence from the court.Lillard’s return comes at a familiar event due to his shooting history. He enters as a two-time champion, chasing a rare third title while continuing his recovery from a serious injury. The NBA confirmed his participation days before All-Star Saturday, placing him at the center of a contest.Portland Trail Blazers star Damian Lillard, who is currently rehabbing, will be part of the eight-man field competing in Saturday's 3-point contest as part of All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles. Lillard won the competitions in 2023 in Salt Lake City and 2024 in Indianapolis. He now has a chance to match Larry Bird and Craig Hodges as the only three-time winners in event history.The field includes Devin Booker of the Phoenix Suns, rookie Kon Knueppel from the Charlotte Hornets, Tyrese Maxey of the Philadelphia 76ers, Donovan Mitchell of the Cleveland Cavaliers, Jamal Murray of the Denver Nuggets, Bobby Portis Jr.of the Milwaukee Bucks, and Norman Powell of the Miami Heat. Mitchell leads the league with 180 made 3-pointers, while Portis owns the best accuracy at 45.1 percent this season. Knueppel could become the first rookie to win the contest.As for Lillard, he ranks fifth all-time in NBA history with 2,804 made three-pointers across 13 seasons.Lillard has not appeared in an NBA game this season because he is recovering from a torn left Achilles tendon. The injury occurred during last year’s playoffs while he was with the Milwaukee Bucks. The setback required surgery and a long rehabilitation process, leading to a decision to sit out the entire season.During the offseason, Lillard signed a three-year deal to return to Portland, the franchise where he spent his first 11 NBA seasons. The plan from the start centered on a full recovery rather than rushing back. He recently shared an update on his progress while speaking to the Road Trippin’ Show.“It’s going great,"" Lillard said, per NBC Sports. ""I think it’s just one of those injuries where you’ve got to take your time — you know, it takes what it takes. The first couple of weeks to maybe two or three months is kind of frustrating because you’re so limited.""But with patience, giving yourself grace, and doing the things necessary to continue progressing, you get to a point where you start to see the light at the end of the tunnel.”That timeline places his full return next season, with All-Star Saturday offering a controlled stage for his first competitive appearance since last spring.",Damian Lillard will compete in Saturday's 3-point contest as part of NBA All- Star Weekend in Los Angeles. The Portland Trail Blazers star has not played this season because of a torn left Achilles tendon.

My two cents on this mock trade

Trade talk is building around the Los Angeles Lakers as the 2025-26 season moves through February. Reports suggest the team may try to acquire Giannis Antetokounmpo in the offseason and place him alongside LeBron James and Luka Dončić If it happens, the move would show the Lakers are still focused on winning immediately. It would also raise practical questions about cost, roster balance, and whether Milwaukee would consider moving its franchise player.Giannis Antetokounmpo is under contract with the Milwaukee Bucks through the 2026-27 season and has a player option for 2027-28. He is earning $54.1 million this season and is scheduled to make $58.5 million next year. A deadline trade is unlikely, but Milwaukee could review its options in the summer depending on results and the player’s stance.The Lakers currently have LeBron, Dončić, Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, Deandre Ayton, Marcus Smart, Jarred Vanderbilt, Dalton Knecht, Adou Thiero, and future first-round picks. One proposed structure meets salary rules and reflects the type of return Milwaukee would likely demand.• Giannis Antetokounmpo (F, 31, $58.5M in 2026-27)• Thanasis Antetokounmpo (F, minimum contract)• Austin Reaves (SG, projected $15-18M in 2026-27)• Rui Hachimura (PF, projected $13-15M)• Dalton Knecht (SF, rookie-scale)• Adou Thiero (SF, rookie-scale)• 2026 first-round pick or swap• 2030 first-round pick swap• 2032 first-round pick swapThe package would give Milwaukee younger players and draft flexibility while allowing the Lakers to match Giannis’s salary.Adding Giannis Antetokounmpo would give Los Angeles three players who can control the offense and score in different ways.The group would provide scoring, playmaking, and interior defense. Dončić, at 26, would remain the long-term piece, while Giannis (31) and LeBron (41) suggest a shorter title window. From a business view, a roster led by two international stars and one of the league’s most recognizable players would carry strong global appeal.If the Bucks decide to move Antetokounmpo, the priority would likely be future assets. Reaves has playoff experience and a manageable contract. Hachimura adds size and flexibility. Knecht and Thiero would be developmental players. Multiple picks would give the team options to rebuild or pursue another star.Milwaukee would still have rotation players such as Myles Turner, Thanasis Antetokounmpo, Cole Anthony, and Gary Harris, so the roster would not be empty during a transition.Giannis Antetokounmpo has said he is not leaving Milwaukee, but league discussion continues about where he might consider playing if the situation changes. The Knicks and Heat are often mentioned as possible destinations.Los Angeles Lakers would offer a ready-made contender and strong market visibility. The adjustment would come from sharing possessions with two other primary creators and handling the defensive workload that comes with a fast system.- Advantages: stronger title chances, defensive improvement, and commercial impact.- Risks: reduced depth, fewer future picks, possible fit issues, and age-related durability concerns.- Advantages: draft capital, younger contributors, and avoiding a later free-agency situation.- Risks: losing the face of the franchise, uncertainty around player development, and possible fan reaction.In the short term, the Los Angeles Lakers would likely improve their championship chances. Milwaukee’s long-term result would depend on how well it uses the picks and young players.For Giannis Antetokounmpo, the decision would shape the later years of his prime, whether that means continuing as Milwaukee’s centerpiece or joining a roster built to compete immediately.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Golden State Warriors predicted to land $240 million Utah Jazz star center to support Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler A trade sending Giannis to the Los Angeles Lakers is still speculative but possible under league rules. There is a lot of risk involved but so is the potential reward and that is a roster built around three of the league’s most productive players. The direction each team chooses later this year will determine whether the idea stays theoretical or turns into the biggest move of the 2026 offseason.","Giannis Antetokounmpo is under contract with the Milwaukee Bucks through the 2026-27 season and has a player option for 2027-28.

Cam Thomas brings stability and security to Milwaukee Bucks after Brooklyn Nets release

Cam Thomas’ could help Milwaukee Bucks despite limited league-wide interest

Tony Ronzone of Wasserman, Cam Thomas's agent, informed ESPN on Sunday that the free agency guard has reached an agreement with the Milwaukee Bucks. There are rumors that the Bucks are interested in Cam Thomas, and they are the only team with that interest. The Bucks were the only team with genuine interest in Thomas, according to NBA insider Jake Fischer, even though the Brooklyn Nets made trade offers for him.The Brooklyn Nets waived Thomas shortly after the trade deadline on February 5. They seem to be the front-runners to sign him now that he is a free agent. The Nets selected the 24-year-old with the 27th overall choice in the 2021 NBA draft, and he began his career with them.The 24-year-old Thomas, who has averaged 21.4 points per game over the previous three seasons, gives the Bucks, who are still attempting to contend this season without Giannis Antetokounmpo, an instant skill boost.After more than four seasons with the team and unsuccessful trade negotiations, Thomas was dismissed by Brooklyn earlier this week. Following his waiver, Thomas informed Marc Spears of ESPN Andscape:“Super excited, ready to actually help and contribute to another team..My next team is getting elite scoring, good playmaking and a good combo guard.”As per insider Jake Fischer:""I haven't heard anything about a team that would want Cam Thomas. The one team we heard was Milwaukee, but they did not want to pay draft capital to acquire him. Could he go to Milwaukee now? It's possible, but that's the only real spot I've heard with Cam Thomas interest all along.""A left hamstring ailment earlier in the season kept Thomas out of action for 20 games. In 24 games this season, he is scoring 15.6 points on average. Thomas, who will be in unrestricted free agency this summer, accepted a $5.9 million qualifying offer during the summer after failing to sign an extension with the Nets.Since Thomas is still available, it appears that no one is interested in signing him as a free agent after he was waived, and no one wants to trade for him at the deadline. During his first two seasons in the NBA, Thomas showed his ability to score points while playing a supporting position alongside elite players like Mikal Bridges, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Durant.During his 2023–24 season, he scored 22.5 points and pulled down 3.2 rebounds per game, shooting 44.2 percent from the field and 36.4 percent from beyond the arc. He ultimately got more chances with the ball in his hands and flourished.The Los Angeles Lakers, who are now in last place in terms of bench points per game, thought they may be a serious contender for his services. But the Lakers chose to give their two-way guard Kobe Bufkin a regular deal instead. The fact that Thomas was there for the taking speaks volumes about their feelings for him. It's possible that many other teams share the same position.Thomas may assist the Milwaukee Bucks in addressing one of their main issues, which is scoring, even though he wouldn't be able to fix every one of them. The following season, he averaged 24.0 points per game, but a hamstring ailment kept him from playing in more than 25 games.","Milwaukee Bucks have reached an agreement with Cam Thomas, his agent said. The 24-year-old guard was waived by the Brooklyn Nets earlier this week. Thomas has averaged 21.4 points per game over the previous three seasons.

Did LeBron James really punch Luka Doncic? Debunking viral AI video spreading rapidly across social media platforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/did-lebron-james-really-punch-luka-doncic-debunking-viral-ai-video-spreading-rapidly-across-social-media-platforms/articleshow/128084310.cms,"Another AI video of LeBron James went viral (Image via NBA)

No, LeBron James did not punch Luka Doncic, Stephen Curry, Michael Jordan and other NBA giants

LeBron James has previously taken legal actions against disturbing AI videos trying to defame him

The concept of artificial intelligence can be frightening. LeBron James is thus setting a clear boundary at a time when deepfakes make it difficult to distinguish between fiction and defamation. A crazy AI movie that purports to depict LeBron James punching Steph Curry, Michael Jordan, and others is making the rounds. It also appears to be very realistic.Luka Doncic, Stephen Curry, Michael Jordan, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, Bronny James, Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, and Anthony Davis are all on the list of individuals whom LeBron punched in this blatantly phony film. However, ironically, this wasn’t the first time an AI video of James went viral.An AI-generated image of LeBron twerking marked the end of the video. The caption of the video read:“I open the neighbor’s Wi-Fi, swipe my finger, see the most random and nonsensical video I’ve ever watched, close the neighbor’s Wi-Fi..”Millions of people have viewed the posts on X that share this. It's difficult to think that someone could make such footage so easily, but they can, and it challenges many common beliefs about seeing is believing.This isn't real, though. However, this is not the first instance of this kind of event occurring. A burgeoning legal struggle against the misuse of artificial intelligence now centers on the NBA legend.After unsettling AI-generated films with James' likeness, including one that showed him as pregnant, went viral, James and his legal team sent a cease-and-desist letter to FlickUp, the firm that created Interlink AI.Interlink AI, a Discord-hosted video-generation application that allows users to produce incredibly lifelike films of celebrities without their permission, is at the heart of the dispute. Stephen Curry, Nikola Jokić, LeBron James, and others unintentionally became avatars in a virtual playground that swiftly descended into grotesqueness.According to 404 Media, one video, which showed an AI-generated Sean ""Diddy"" Combs s*xually attacking a dummy Steph Curry in a prison environment while an expressionless AI LeBron James watched in the background, garnered over 6.2 million Instagram views.Others depicted James reaching out to Curry while clutching a pregnant belly, kneeling with his tongue out, or homeless.FlickUp founder Jason Stacks in an Instagram Reel said:“This is a letter from one of the biggest NBA players of all time. Two months ago, I launched the YouTube AI video. It was a fun idea to help creators make some more money. But then people started noticing… Like this guy, yeah, LeBron James. And he wasn’t happy, because I got this cease-and-desist from his team.”Stacks said that the attention caught him off guard and that he deleted all realistic users from the platform within 30 minutes of receiving the legal warning from Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks. He said to 404 Media:“We removed the models immediately and have since updated our approach to likeness and public figure policies.. That’s really the full story on our end.”Now, following this, The makers of AI-generated videos that featured James' likeness allegedly received cease-and-desist letters from his legal team. Attorneys for James submitted a cease-and-desist letter to the developers of Interlink AI, a Discord community and AI program that enabled users create films of NBA players, according to 404 Media.James' lawyer sent him a letter ""a couple of weeks ago,"" according to Jason Stacks, founder of the AI generation platform FlickUp, which houses Interlink. He further said:“Within 30 minutes of receiving the cease and desist, we made the decision to remove all realistic people from Interlink AI's software,” Stacks told 404 Media, confirming the letter came from the law firm Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks. “Generative AI is the ‘wild west’ when it comes to copyright & IP, but we're committed to being on the right side of that change…”Nevertheless, James hasn’t said anything about the recent AI video as of yet.","A video purports to depict LeBron James punching Steph Curry, Michael Jordan, and others is making the rounds.

Jayson Tatum takes key rehab step with controlled scrimmages as Boston Celtics await return decision

Boston Celtics maintain cautious stance on Jayson Tatum’s return amid strong recovery progress

With a 34-18 record and the second seed in the Eastern Conference, the Boston Celtics have been having a fantastic season without their franchise player, Jayson Tatum. On the Tatum front, they may be receiving a significant update, though. Achilles, Tatum, is now able to participate in controlled 5-on-5 scrimmages with the coaching staff.It is obvious that the Celtics will not bring him back until Tatum is completely sure of his Achilles, and if that means he has to wait until 2026–2027, then the team will accept that. ESPN's Shams Charania reports that Jayson Tatum has met yet another milestone in his Achilles rehabilitation.Although this is by no means a major update, fantasy managers will accept what they can for now. There is still no set return date for Tatum, and there have been mixed rumors about whether he will try to make a comeback this season.On the network's pregame broadcast on Sunday, Charania stated that the Celtics star ""has started controlled 5-on-5 scrimmaging with coaches."" Compared to the one-on-one training that reporters have been witnessing in recent weeks, that is a step forward.Shams Charania of ESPN claims that Tatum has begun participating in regulated basketball workouts, such as five-on-five scrimmages.:“Sources tell me Jayson Tatum has started controlled five-on-five scrimmaging with coaches. He has aggressively attacked his rehab at every turn…there’s more phases in his rehab, he has to practice with his team of course, and then again there's also the normal nerves of coming back from an injury of this magnitude, a torn achilles, in May..”He continued:“To a really good team that has aspirations to advance in the playoffs. Jayson Tatum has made clear to the people around him that he wants to come back as close to Jayson Tatum as possible, not a shell of himself, not a lesser percentage of himself....""He further added:""And the other side of all that is the Celtics’ medical staff will have to clear him 100% before he can return, and he himself will have to feel 100% confidence and trust in that leg before he makes a potential return this season..”With his co-star Jaylen Brown, who is having an MVP-caliber season, leading the charge, his teammates have come together in his absence. This does not, however, imply that Tatum should miss this season. Ultimately, Tatum has the final say over whether or not he comes back. However, he ought to come back to Banner 19 to give his squad their best chance if he is comfortable being himself.Tatum has admitted that reintegrating into a Boston club that has performed well without him could present ""challenges."" According to a later story, he was ""reevaluating"" whether to play this season or wait until 2026-2027.The Celtics want the same, Stevens said.“The best (time) for Jayson Tatum to come back is when he’s 110% healthy, he’s fully cleared by everybody that matters in that decision, and he’s got great peace of mind and he’s ready to do it,” Stevens said in his post-trade deadline news conference. “That’s it. That’s the objective, and that’s what we’re going to stick with.”When asked whether the Celtics have an internal return date for Tatum,Stevens replied: “When we feel 100%, it’ll be a group getting together and talking…”He said:“I think our medical people are really good.. I think his doctors are really good. So we’re going to listen to them. He’s listening to them. I think (trainer) Nick (Sang) and (Taum) have had an amazing work ethic throughout this whole recovery. When it’s right, then we’ll all sit down and talk about it…""He further added:""There’s still no force from us. There’s no pressure from us. But there’s also not going to be any of us saying, ‘Well, why doesn’t he just take another week?’ When he’s ready, he’s ready.”Tatum played 36.4 minutes per game in 72 games last season, averaging 26.8 points, 8.7 rebounds, six assists, and 1.1 steals. Because he could score, grab rebounds, create plays, and anchor down on defense by earning a steal almost every game, he was the engine of their offense.","Jayson Tatum has met yet another milestone in his Achilles rehabilitation.

Washington Wizards waive injured Dante Exum after Anthony Davis blockbuster trade creates roster flexibility

Dante Exum’s injury-hit journey continues as Washington Wizards create roster space after waiver move

On Sunday, the Washington Wizards declared that they had asked for waivers for Dante Exum. Before Thursday's trade deadline, Washington made a blockbuster trade including Anthony Davis, and Exum was one of four players acquired from Dallas.Given that the athlete missed all of the 2025–2026 season due to season-ending surgery on his right knee in December, the move was not surprising. The Washington Wizards acquired the Dallas Mavericks wing and Australian Boomers bronze medalist in 2025, along with All-NBA First Team player Anthony Davis.On X, the Washington Wizards declared on Saturday that they had placed veteran player Dante Exum on waivers. The official tweet read:“The Washington Wizards have requested waivers on guard Dante Exum…”Exum is out for the season and is set to become a free agent this summer, so the Wizards' decision to cut him shortly after acquiring him as part of the eight-player deal last week that sent Anthony Davis to Washington comes as little surprise.Washington might sign a free agent for a 10-day or remaining-of-season contract, or it might use the available roster space to upgrade one of its three two-way players to a regular contract.Apparently, the action was not surprising. His season ended before it started due to complications from an offseason procedure on that knee that eventually necessitated follow-up surgery. Over Exum's career, injuries have been a recurrent theme.The former fifth overall pick missed the whole 2015–16 season due to a torn ACL after playing all 82 games as a rookie. He later struggled with recurrent knee, ankle, and shoulder problems.After playing well in Europe from 2021 to 2023, Exum restored his NBA value before rejoining Dallas. Dallas sold him to them in the Anthony Davis trade. The veteran guard's $3.3 million contract was about to expire.Washington now has two roster spots available that can be filled with regular NBA salaries after dismissing Exum. Keshon Gilbert's 10-day contract is presently filling one of the positions.The 30-year-old Australian averaged 8.0 points, 2.8 assists, and 2.4 rebounds in 19.5 minutes per game on strong shooting splits when healthy, making him a valuable rotation player for the Mavericks.Nevertheless, he has only made 75 appearances overall since the 2023–24 season began, including just 20 in 2024–25 because of wrist surgery and a fractured hand.Elite athletic tools, several injury setbacks, and a successful late-career comeback have all been features of Exum's career, which has spanned the NBA, Europe, and international basketball. Exum was a high-upside guard who joined the Utah Jazz as the fifth overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft.However, he suffered a ruptured ACL and other serious injuries that plagued his early NBA career. After playing for Cleveland and Utah, he left the NBA in 2021 to rebuild his career in Europe with FC Barcelona and Partizan Belgrade, where he was named to the All-ABA League Team in 2023 and won an ABA League title.Now, with one of those roster places, Washington could now sign one of its two-way players, Tristan Vukcevic, Jamir Watkins, or Sharife Cooper, to a regular NBA contract. After Exum clears waivers, Washington will still be responsible for his $2,296,274 salary cost; but, the move frees up a roster space.With Keshon Gilbert signing a 10-day contract to take the 14th position, the Wizards now have 13 players on regular contracts.",Washington Wizards waive injured Dante Exum after Anthony Davis blockbuster trade creates roster flexibility.

NEW DELHI: The Harbhajan Singh–Sreesanth altercation remains one of the darkest and most debated episodes in Indian Premier League (IPL) history. Nearly 18 years later, the infamous “slap-gate” controversy has resurfaced after former IPL chairman Lalit Modi revealed he possesses unseen footage of the incident, sparking questions about why the video never saw the light of day.The flashpoint occurred during the inaugural IPL season in 2008, when Mumbai Indians' stand-in skipper Harbhajan Singh slapped Kings XI Punjab pacer Sreesanth after a match in Mohali.Television cameras later captured Sreesanth crying uncontrollably, an image that dominated headlines and cast a shadow over the fledgling league. Harbhajan was banned for 11 matches and lost his match fees, while the BCCI disciplinary committee held him guilty of misconduct.Modi, speaking on Michael Clarke 's Beyond23 Cricket Podcast, claimed one of his security cameras caught the exact moment. “As players were exchanging handshakes, Bhajji just looked at Sreesanth, said something, and gave him a backhander. That's what the footage shows. I've had it for 18 years,” he said, adding that the clip was never made public.Cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle has now explained why. “Interesting that the Harbhajan-Sreesanth video has found its way out after 17 years.Very few of us had seen it and we had given our word that it would stay out of the public domain because the IPL was in its first year and it wouldn't have been the best bit of news for it,” Bhogle posted on X.His remarks underline how the league, in its infancy, chose to protect its image over exposing a damaging scandal in full detail.While Harbhajan and Sreesanth have long reconciled and transitioned into commentary roles, the revival of the episode has drawn fresh criticism. Sreesanth's wife strongly condemned Modi and Clarke , accusing them of “dragging up old wounds” for publicity.With Bhogle's revelation, fans finally understand why the infamous video was buried for nearly two decades — to shield the IPL's reputation in its formative years.","The infamous'slap-gate' controversy has resurfaced after former IPL chairman Lalit Modi revealed he possesses unseen footage of the incident.

His century against Gujarat Titans, scoring 101 off 38 balls, came against a strong bowling lineup featuring Mohammed Siraj, Ishant Sharma, Washington Sundar, Prasidh Krishna, and Rashid Khan.The Bihar-born cricketer continued his impressive form in youth cricket, scoring 143 off 78 balls against England's U19 team in Worcester.

Nitish Rana hails Starc: haven’t seen death bowling like this in a long time

NEW DELHI: The Delhi Premier League Eliminator turned into a fiery spectacle at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Friday, as West Delhi Lionz skipper Nitish Rana and South Delhi Superstarz spinner Dignesh Singh Rathi almost came to blows in a heated mid-match confrontation.The official DPL handle later shared the video of the dramatic incident on X, which quickly went viral.The footage showed Rathi pulling out during his run-up, leaving Rana waiting at the crease in visible irritation. Moments later, when Rathi was finally about to release the ball, Rana walked away deliberately, further escalating the tension. The drama reached its peak when Rana audaciously reverse-swept Rathi for a six, following which both players exchanged angry words. Teammates and the umpire had to rush in to prevent the situation from spiraling into a physical altercation.The tension did not end there. Soon after, Krish Yadav attempted to clear the long-off boundary off Aman Bharti but was caught by Anmol Sharma. What followed was an ugly on-field melee, as furious exchanges broke out between South Delhi’s Sumit Mathur, bowler Aman Bharti, and Yadav. Players from both sides got involved in pushing and shoving before officials intervened to restore order.Amid the chaos, Rana’s bat did the talking. The West Delhi captain played a sensational unbeaten knock of 134* off just 55 deliveries, powering his team to a thrilling seven-wicket win while chasing a daunting 202. His innings, laced with audacious strokeplay, proved the defining factor as the Lions roared into Qualifier 2.Earlier, South Delhi Superstarz had piled up 201/5, courtesy of Tejasvi Dahiya’s 60 off 33 and Sumit Mathur’s 48 not out. But despite their formidable total, it was Rana’s masterclass — and his fiery exchanges with Rathi — that stole the limelight.The West Delhi Lions will now face East Delhi Riders in Qualifier 2, with the winner set to meet Central Delhi Kings in the grand finale.","Nitish Rana and Dignesh Singh Rathi almost came to blows in a heated mid-match confrontation.

Sports memorabilia carry immense emotional, cultural, and historical value, often transcending sport itself. Cricket, with its rich heritage, has produced some of the most treasured artefacts ever auctioned. From iconic bats to legendary baggy greens, these prized possessions not only capture unforgettable moments on the field but also command staggering sums under the hammer.In 2020, Shane Warne stunned the cricketing world by auctioning his treasured Baggy Green cap to raise funds for the Australian bushfire appeal. The cap eventually fetched an extraordinary A$1,007,500, bought by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The bank ensured it wasn't locked away but displayed nationwide to raise more money for the cause. Today, the cap rests at the Bradman Museum in Bowral, immortalising Warne's generosity as much as his unmatched spin wizardry.Bradman's first Test cap, worn in the 1928-29 series against England, remains one of the most significant items in cricket history.Symbolising the humble beginning of a career that would later define cricketing greatness, this rare artefact was auctioned in 2020 for nearly A$450,000. Collectors see it as the genesis of “The Don's” incredible journey, from a young debutant to the greatest batsman the sport has ever seen, with an immortal average of 99.94.The National Museum of Australia recently secured a piece of cricket's greatest legacy — Sir Donald Bradman's Baggy Green worn during the 1946–47 Ashes series. The Don amassed 680 runs in that series, averaging a staggering 97.14. Auctioned for A$438,500, this cap is among just 11 Bradman baggy greens known to exist. It represents not only his cricketing genius but also Australia's post-war revival, making it a national treasure beyond monetary value.Bradman's Baggy Green from his farewell tour of England in 1948 — famously known as the “Invincibles” tour — is another priceless relic. It was during this tour that he needed just four runs to secure a Test average of 100 but was bowled for a duck in his final innings. The cap sold in 2003 for £170,000 to a UK-based collector. More than memorabilia, it is a poignant reminder of cricket's most human moment.Few sporting memories stir as much emotion as MS Dhoni's six that sealed India's 2011 World Cup triumph after 28 years. The bat used in that iconic moment was auctioned for £100,000, bought by R K Global Shares & Securities Ltd. At the time, it became the most expensive cricket bat ever sold. Beyond its price, the willow represents national pride, Dhoni's legendary calmness under pressure, and a generation's most cherished sporting memory.Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack is often called the “Bible of Cricket,” and a complete set covering its first 144 editions (1864–2007) was sold for a whopping £84,000 in 2008. The collection included rare index issues, making it highly desirable for cricket historians and collectors alike. Beyond its market value, the Almanack is a time capsule of cricketing history — chronicling the evolution of the game from its early days to the modern professional era.In 1968, Sir Garfield Sobers etched his name into cricket folklore by hitting six consecutive sixes in an over against Glamorgan's Malcolm Nash in a first-class match. The bat that delivered those historic blows was auctioned in 2000, fetching £54,257. For fans, it symbolises the audacity and power of Sobers, arguably cricket's greatest all-rounder. The sale not only honoured the record itself but also preserved the spirit of attacking cricket Sobers embodied.Before Brian Lara broke it decades later, Sobers' monumental 365 against Pakistan in 1958 stood as the highest individual Test score for 36 years. The bat with which he achieved this feat was auctioned in 2000 for £47,475. More than just wood and leather, this willow embodies the brilliance of Sobers' strokeplay and his ability to dominate bowling attacks. For collectors, it remains one of the purest connections to Test cricket's golden records.These jaw-dropping auction figures prove that cricketing history isn't just about numbers on a scorecard. From Bradman to Dhoni to Warne, these artefacts are priceless bridges between generations — symbols of sporting greatness preserved forever.","Cricket has produced some of the most treasured artefacts ever auctioned.

A piece of Australian sporting history has found a permanent home, after a cricket cap worn by Sir Donald Bradman during the 1946-47 Ashes series was bought by the National Museum of Australia in Canberra for AU$438,500 (approx. US$286,700).The federal government covered half the purchase cost, with Arts Minister Tony Burke hailing the acquisition as vital for safeguarding a national treasure.“You’d be hard-pressed to meet an Australian that hasn’t heard of the great Donald Bradman, arguably the greatest cricketer of all time,” Burke said. “Now to have one of his iconic baggy greens in the National Museum of Australia means visitors will have the opportunity to get up close and connect with our sporting and cultural history.”Bradman wore the cap as captain in the 1946-47 Ashes series – the first Test contest between Australia and England after World War II – scoring 680 runs at a staggering average of 97.14 to lead his team to a 3-0 victory. That triumph lit the spark for the 1948 ‘Invincibles’ tour, when Australia went unbeaten in England.The baggy green is one of only 11 of Bradman’s known to exist. Another is housed in the Australian Sports Museum, while the rest remain in private collections.National Museum director Katherine McMahon said the acquisition honours both Bradman’s brilliance and the spirit of resilience he symbolised.“Sir Donald’s baggy green marks the life of Australia’s most celebrated batsman and reflects a time when sporting heroes gave Australians hope, following the heartbreak and hardship of the Second World War,” she said.The cap will now feature in the museum’s Landmarks gallery, joining other national treasures that shaped Australia’s identity.",Bradman wore the cap as captain in the 1946-47 Ashes series.

Paris Olympics 2024: Neeraj Chopra Wins Silver, Pak's Arshad Nadeem Breaks Record | 'Also Our Son'

Two-time Olympic medallist Neeraj Chopra had to settle for a runner-up finish in the Diamond League Final for the third year in a row as Germany’s Julian Weber produced a commanding performance to win his maiden title with two massive 90m-plus throws in Zurich on Thursday.Weber lit up the event with a season world-leading 91.57m effort, also his personal best, coming in the second round. He had already set the tone with 91.37m in his opening attempt, and from there it was a one-man show. None of his rivals came close to the German, whose five legal throws all went beyond 83m, underlining his dominance in the seven-man field.Chopra, meanwhile, had an uncharacteristically modest series. The 27-year-old Indian began with 84.35m and then slipped with efforts of 82m and a foul. At the halfway stage, he was placed third behind Trinidad and Tobago’s Keshorn Walcott. Two more fouls followed before he salvaged his night with a final-round 85.01m to snatch back second place, edging Walcott by just six centimeters. Defending champion Anderson Peters of Grenada finished fourth with 82.06m.“This was not too bad,” Chopra reflected after the event. “We are getting close to the world championships, so I still need to throw a little further.A few things went well, a few things did not. But I am very happy for Julian – he managed to throw really far. Showing 91m was really good.”The modest return was a rare off-day for Chopra, who has made a habit of breaching the 88m mark in recent seasons and famously crossed the 90m barrier earlier this year in Doha. He acknowledged that the focus now shifts to Tokyo, where he will defend his world title next month. “At major championships, the gold is more important than the far throws. So I will try my best to win the medal,” he said.For Weber, it was another breakthrough in a season where he has already thrown over 90m three times, including his 91.06m effort in Doha in May. Thursday’s win also gave him a 3-1 edge over Chopra in head-to-head contests this season, although the Indian still holds a dominant 15-5 overall record.Chopra has not finished outside the top two in any competition since June 2021. But on the biggest Diamond League stage, Weber’s night of brilliance ensured the Indian star had to settle for second best yet again.",Two-time Olympic medallist Neeraj Chopra had to settle for a runner-up finish in the Diamond League Final for the third year in a row.

Tourism Australia has launched a new version of its ""Come and Say G'day"" campaign specifically targeting the Indian audiences. The new campaign features Sara Tendulkar , daughter of cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar , alongside Ruby the Souvenir Kangaroo, an animated character. It is a $130 million initiative aiming to increase Indian tourists' visit to Australia, capitalising on the market's impressive growth with visitor arrivals exceeding 450,000 and spending reaching $2.7 billion.The new tourism campaign's success builds on strong momentum in the Indian market. Nishant Kashikar, Tourism Australia's country manager for India and the Gulf, reports that Indian visitor numbers are up 8% from last year. Even more impressive is the 21% increase in overnight stays, totalling 29 million nights, and a 14% jump in spending by Indian tourists.Sara Tendulkar's selection as brand ambassador wasn't random. She has a long-standing connection with Australia, having visited the country since childhood. ""Sara has been visiting Australia ever since she was a kid, over the past couple of decades, and therefore, as a result of the trip, she's developed that natural affinity and an emotional connect with Australia,"" explains Kashikar.The 27-year-old Sara Tendulkar brings more than just star power to the role. ""For me, the 'Come and Say G'day' campaign goes beyond tourism. It's about sharing stories of the places that shape you,"" she told NDTV. Her Instagram posts showcase various Australian experiences, including a nostalgic visit to the Melbourne Cricket Ground.Sara's engagement with the campaign reflects her personal philosophy about travel. ""Travel is about discovery, culture, food, and the interesting people you meet along the way,"" she shared.""That's the kind of work I want to keep doing - something that connects people and creates lasting impressions that stay with you long after the holiday.""Tourism Australia sees huge potential in the Indian market. They aim to attract 500,000 Indian visitors by next year.

Poll Is it more important for a fast bowler to focus on speed or accuracy? Speed Accuracy Both are equally important

Bengaluru: Mohammed Shami is barely a week away from his 35th birthday and much slower than he once was, but the fire within hasn’t dimmed. Neither has the tenacity to fight. With several of his illustrious teammates having called it a day in recent times, Shami has received many not-so-subtle hints to walk off into the sunset.But the premier fast bowler isn’t throwing in the towel just yet, and as he reiterated just a couple of days ago, “The day I get bored, I will leave. You don’t pick me, don’t play me, I don’t care. But I will keep working hard.”Arguably one of India’s finest pace-bowling exponents, Shami has his focus set on the 2027 50-over World Cup. Mentally, he is all there. The question is, will his body hold up? His last appearance in the ODI format, after all, was in the Champions Trophy final in Dubai in March earlier this year.Playing in his first competitive red-ball game since Nov 2024, the Bengal pacer was slow but not rusty in the Duleep Trophy tie between East and North Zone at the BCCI Centre of Excellence here on Thursday. He bowled 17 overs spread over four spells, focusing more on accuracy rather than speed, on a surface that offered considerable bounce but little seam movement.He was effective but not incisive, looking primarily to test his injury-ravaged body.In his first spell of five overs, his inswingers from good length troubled the right-handers — openers Shubham Khajuria and Ankit Kumar, in particular — while his next spell of three overs was rather uneventful, barring a few edges towards fine leg.Post lunch, Shami switched ends and gears. He appeared to have assessed the conditions to his satisfaction, and his third spell of 4-2-9-0 was his best of the day. Shami was more probing, as he tempted Ayush Badoni and Yash Dhull in the corridor outside off. He finally struck late in the day with a delivery that sent back Sahil Lotra.Shami continued the probing line and in the 70th over, Lotra offered a thick edge to wicketkeeper Kumar Kushagra. The catch was redemption for Kushagra, who had earlier dropped Kanhaiya Wadhwan off Shami. With rain ensuring an early end, it will be interesting to see how Shami and his new-ball partner Mukesh Kumar , who went out for nine overs due to a niggle, fare on a moist surface.","Mohammed Shami played in his first competitive red-ball game since Nov 2024.

'Never Dreamt of This...': Rohit Sharma's BIG CONFESSION After Retirement From Test Cricket

What is the Bronco Test?

Former India cricketer Manoj Tiwary has made a striking claim about the introduction of the Bronco Test in Indian cricket, suggesting it could be aimed at keeping Rohit Sharma out of the team. The new fitness benchmark, implemented under India’s strength and conditioning coach Adrian Le Roux, adds to the existing Yo-Yo and 2-kilometre time trial tests that players must meet.Speaking to Crictracker, Tiwary raised questions about the timing and purpose of the test, particularly as India prepares for a transitional phase ahead of the 2027 World Cup. ""I think it will be very difficult to keep Virat Kohli out of the plans for the 2027 World Cup, but I have doubts about Rohit Sharma. I believe the Bronco Test has been introduced for players like him. It seems designed to make it difficult for some senior players to stay in the team,"" Tiwary said.Tiwary also highlighted that Rohit could struggle to re-enter the ODI setup if his fitness standards are not up to the mark. He questioned why the test was introduced at this particular time rather than at the start of the new head coach’s tenure. ""Why now? Who decided to bring in the Bronco Test? It is hard to say, but the observation is that players like Rohit will find it challenging if they do not work hard on their fitness,"" he added.Drawing parallels with past phases in Indian cricket, Tiwary said similar fitness benchmarks have previously sidelined senior players. ""When legends like Gambhir, Sehwag, and Yuvraj were performing well, the Yo-Yo Test was introduced after the 2011 World Cup. Fitness standards have often been used to shape team selection,"" he explained.The Bronco Test is an endurance-focused fitness challenge commonly used in sports like rugby. Unlike the Yo-Yo Test, which allows short recovery breaks, the Bronco Test requires players to complete continuous shuttle runs of 20 metres, 40 metres, and 60 metres, repeated five times without a pause, covering a total of 1,200 metres. Top-level Indian cricketers are expected to complete it in around six minutes.For context, the Yo-Yo Test is a 20-metre shuttle run with increasing speed and ten-second recovery intervals, with a minimum pass mark of 17.1. The 2-kilometre time trial requires fast bowlers to finish in 8 minutes 15 seconds and batters, spinners, and wicketkeepers in 8 minutes 30 seconds.The decision to implement the Bronco Test reportedly followed concerns over endurance levels during India’s recent five-Test tour of England. Among the fast bowlers, only Mohammed Siraj managed to play all five matches, highlighting potential gaps in fitness.",Former India cricketer Manoj Tiwary questions the purpose of the Bronco Test.

Poll Do you agree with Suresh Raina's choice of Virat Kohli as the biggest symbol of change in Indian cricket? Yes No

Former India cricketer Suresh Raina has picked Virat Kohli at the top of his list as he named the five players who, in his opinion, have had the greatest influence on Indian cricket. Speaking on Shubhankar Mishra’s YouTube podcast, Raina praised Kohli ’s transformation of the game both on and off the field.“The five players who, in my view, have had the biggest impact on Indian cricket are: First, Virat Kohli. The way he transformed the fitness culture, the way he became a GOAT and went on to score more than 50 centuries shows how different his attitude was. Scoring hundreds almost every other match changed the atmosphere inside the dressing room,” Raina said.Kohli, who stepped away from T20 internationals in 2024 and announced his retirement from Test cricket earlier this year, continues to remain central to India’s ODI plans. Both he and captain Rohit Sharma are set to feature in the upcoming ODI series against Australia in October.Kohli also achieved a long-awaited milestone last season, winning his maiden IPL title with Royal Challengers Bengaluru.Raina said Kohli’s contribution extended beyond his runs. By setting new benchmarks in fitness, Kohli inspired an entire generation of cricketers to adopt higher physical standards.For Raina, Kohli’s influence wasn’t limited to statistics. He credited the former captain for creating a culture of belief and intensity in the Indian dressing room as well.While Raina also mentioned other names who shaped Indian cricket, it was Kohli who, in his eyes, stood out as the biggest symbol of change.","Former India cricketer Suresh Raina has named Virat Kohli as the biggest symbol of change in Indian cricket.

Poll Do you think Lalit Modi should have kept the unseen footage of the 2008 incident private? Yes, it was unnecessary to bring it up again. No, it's part of cricket history.

The infamous Harbhajan Singh–Sreesanth “slap-gate” controversy from the inaugural edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008 has resurfaced following remarks made by former IPL chairman Lalit Modi . Speaking on ex-Australian cricketer Michael Clarke ’s Beyond23 Cricket Podcast, Modi claimed to possess unseen footage of the altercation that shook the league in its early days.The fresh spotlight on the 18-year-old incident has triggered a strong reaction from Sreesanth ’s family, with his wife issuing a scathing statement against Modi and Clarke for “dragging up old wounds” for publicity.“Shame on you @lalitkmodi and @michaelclarkeofficial. You people are not even human to drag up something from 2008 just for your own cheap publicity and views. Both @sreesanthnair36 and Harbhajan have long moved on, they are fathers now with school-going children, and yet you try to throw them back into an old wound. Absolutely disgusting, heartless, and inhuman,” she wrote in her post.She further highlighted how the resurfacing of the episode has affected her family. “@sreesanthnair36 has rebuilt his life with dignity and grace after every hardship he faced. As his wife, and as the mother of his children, it is deeply painful for our family to see this resurface after 18 long years. Families are being forced to relive trauma that was buried decades ago only so you can chase views.This doesn’t just hurt the players, it scars their innocent children who now have to face questions and shame for no fault of theirs. ”The 2008 incident occurred during a clash between Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings) and Mumbai Indians in Mohali. After Punjab’s victory, tempers flared and Mumbai’s stand-in skipper Harbhajan Singh slapped Sreesanth during the post-match exchanges. The fallout saw Harbhajan suspended for the remainder of the season and fined, while both players eventually reconciled years later.Despite the reconciliation, Modi has now stirred the controversy once again, claiming his security cameras captured what television cameras missed. “It happened. Absolutely. And I’ll tell you what happened,” Modi told Clarke, adding that he had kept the video private for nearly two decades.Sreesanth’s wife, however, called the move deeply insensitive. “You should be sued for doing something so cheap and inhumane. Sreesanth is a man of strength and character, and no video can take that dignity away from him. Fear God before you hurt families and innocent children for your own gain,” she wrote.She also criticised the handling of comments on the podcast’s page. “So pathetic! You deleted my comment instead of facing the truth. If you can post for views, at least have the courage to keep the truth visible,” she added. The former Rajasthan Royals bowler also reshared the same on his Instagram afterwards.",Sreesanth's wife Bhuvneshwari has called out Michael Clarke and Lalit Modi for airing the unseen video of the'slap' incident between her husband and Harbhajan Singh from 2008.

Poll Do you think Auqib Nabi has a bright future in Indian cricket? Yes No

: Under sullen, grey skies, the focus on Day 2 of the North Zone vs East Duleep Trophy quarterfinal on Friday quickly shifted to two India pacers — Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana.They didn’t disappoint, but it wasn’t the two star North Zone bowlers who lit up the day. With the sun barely out, Jammu and Kashmir pacer Auqib Nabi turned on the heat, bowling with highlighted precision and purpose. The 28-year-old, who had a breakthrough 2024-25 Ranji Trophy season with 44 wickets, continued with his fine form, returning a hat-trick en route to figures of 5 for 58.Speaking about bowling alongside the Indian pace duo, Nabi said, “They've learnt to stay positive, and I've picked that up from them. When you get a chance, you have to do well. This is the first time I’m playing with them, and I’ve learnt a lot from the experience.”Nabi’s second spell late in the day devastated East as he reaped a clutch of wickets in 10 deliveries. East crumbled under the onslaught, bowled out for 230 in 56.1 overs. North, who finished on 405 in the morning, claimed a commanding 175-run lead.At 200/5 in the 46th over, East, without their main batters Abhimanyu Easwaran and Ishan Kishan, were doing relatively well, until Nabi took the wind out of their sails.The collapse began in the 53rd over when Nabi sent a defiant Virat Singh's middle stump cartwheeling. Manishi then shouldered arms to a ball that hit him on the shin, while Mukhtar Hussain became Nabi's hat-trick victim when a scorcher crashed into his stumps.Yet, Nabi was far from done. Off the first delivery in his next over, he got Suraj Jaiswal to offer an edge to wicketkeeper Kanhaiya Wadhawan and then ended East’s innings by trapping Mohammed Shami leg before. It capped a memorable day for Nabi, which included a fighting 44 with the bat.Earlier, left-arm spinner Manishi ended North Zone’s innings with a six-wicket haul. All of the Jharkhand youngster’s victims were adjudged leg before.In the morning, Suraj Sindhu Jaiswal struck off only his second delivery of the day to send back overnight batter Mayank Dagar (28). At the other end, Nabi survived some close calls, but Shami — new ball in hand and breeze behind him — was lethal.The seasoned pacer breathed fire and precision. Wadhawan was at the receiving end of Shami's short deliveries, one of which hit him on the glove and left him writhing in pain. The next delivery caromed off his helmet. Nabi too was struck on the gloves but he eased the pressure by sending a Shami delivery over the ropesArshdeep admitted that the team under-bowled Nabi — he was brought into the attack in the 15th over. “We’ve never seen him play before, so Harshit and I kept bowling,” Arshdeep said. “When I saw him for the first time in the nets, he took about seven wickets in 10 overs. I thought it was something special. He bowled his second spell quite late as well, but he waited patiently, which is a sign of a good player.”Brief scores: North Zone (O/N: 308/6): 405 all out in 93.2 overs (Kanhaiya Wadhawan 76, Mayank Dagar 28, Auqib Nabi 44; Suraj Jaiswal 2-44, Manishi 3/90) vs East Zone: 230 all out in 56.1 overs (Utkarsh Singh 38, Riyan Parag 39, Virat Singh 69, Kumar Kushagra 29; Harshit Rana 2-56, Nabi 5-28).","Auqib Nabi took a hat-trick and a fighting 44 with the bat to help North Zone to a commanding lead against East Zone in the Duleep Trophy quarterfinal.

India secured a 2-1 victory over Tajikistan in their opening match of the CAFA Nations Cup football tournament in Hisor on Friday. Goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu delivered an outstanding performance with multiple crucial saves, including a penalty save.India, ranked 133rd in the world, took an early lead through defender Anwar Ali in the 5th minute, followed by Sandesh Jhingan's goal in the 13th minute. The team then maintained a defensive stance against the 106th-ranked hosts for the remaining 75 minutes.The match marked a successful debut for new India head coach Khalid Jamil, with captain Gurpreet returning to the starting lineup after being sidelined under former coach Manolo Marquez.""Indian fans had waited for this result for a long time. I know we defended deep at times but we are still rusty but we need to build on this win. We need to show more character against Iran,"" Jhingan said in a snap interview.Despite struggling in attack, India's center-backs Anwar and Jhingan stepped up to end India's three-game scoring drought within the first 15 minutes.The team's formation reflected Jamil's tactical approach, with fullbacks Rahul Bheke and Muhammed Uvais Moyikkal initially providing attacking support before adopting a more defensive role.Anwar Ali opened the scoring with a header following Uvais's long throw-in from the left. The goal was awarded to Anwar after a Tajik defender's attempted clearance rebounded off another player into the net.Jhingan doubled India's lead when he capitalized on a rebound after goalkeeper Muhriddin Hasanov partially saved Bheke's powerful header from Anwar's left-footed cross.India's shift to a defensive approach allowed the hosts to gain momentum. Tajikistan's Sheriddin Boboev set up Shahrom Samiev, who beat Jhingan and scored past Gurpreet to make it 2-1 in the 23rd minute.The Indian midfield struggled to make an impact, with Suresh Singh Wangjam and Lallianzuala Chhangte having minimal influence on the game.Tajikistan started the second half strongly, testing Gurpreet with several shots on target. Jamil responded with three substitutions, bringing on Naorem Mahesh Singh, Nikhil Prabhu, and Danish Farooq.India's forwards Vikram Partap Singh and Irfan Yadawad had limited involvement due to the midfield's focus on defensive duties and lack of service.Tajikistan earned a penalty when Vikram Partap Singh fouled Rustam Soirov in the box. Gurpreet made a crucial save, diving to his right to deny Soirov's spot-kick.In the 85th minute, substitute Naorem Mahesh's powerful left-footed shot was saved by Hasanov. Gurpreet made another impressive save late in the game, his fifth of the second half, to secure India's victory.","India secured a 2-1 victory over Tajikistan in their opening match of the CAFA Nations Cup football tournament.

Poll Do you believe Jose Mourinho can find success at his next club? Absolutely, he's a proven winner Maybe, if given the right resources No, his best days are behind him

Fenerbahce and Besiktas have both made shock coaching changes this week following disappointing European campaigns.Portuguese tactician Jose Mourinho was relieved of his duties at Fenerbahce on Friday after the club failed to reach the Champions League group stage, falling to Benfica in a crucial play-off tie. The 62-year-old, who arrived in Istanbul in June 2024 amid fanfare, had guided the Yellow Canaries to second place in the Turkish league last season.His tenure, however, was marked by setbacks both on and off the field, including clashes with Galatasaray coach Okan Buruk and criticism of Turkish referees. Fenerbahce expressed gratitude for Mourinho’s efforts and wished him success in the future.Meanwhile, Besiktas parted ways with former Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on Thursday. The club’s 1-0 defeat to Swiss side Lausanne in the UEFA Conference League play-off meant Besiktas were eliminated 2-1 on aggregate, prompting an emergency board meeting that ended in Solskjaer’s dismissal.Appointed in January, the Norwegian had faced growing pressure following European and domestic disappointments, including a fourth-place league finish and early Europa League exit. Besiktas thanked Solskjaer for his services in a formal statement.Both high-profile departures highlight the pressure on Turkish clubs to succeed in Europe, even for managers with decorated careers. Mourinho leaves behind memories of passion and controversy, while Solskjaer’s brief Istanbul stint ends after an intense period of expectation and scrutiny.Fans now await who will take the reins at these two storied Istanbul clubs as they aim to rebuild and challenge again on the domestic and European fronts.","Jose Mourinho was relieved of his duties at Fenerbahce on Friday.

Poll Should AIFF prioritize completion of its constitution over starting the new league season? Yes, constitution first No, league season is a priority

: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has submitted before the Supreme Court that it proposes to kickstart the season with the Super Cup or another domestic competition, while the “new league season” is expected to commence from December.Whether the new league continues to be the top-tier Indian Super League (ISL) will depend on Football Sports Development Ltd (FSDL), a subsidiary of Reliance and AIFF’s current marketing partners, taking part and winning the “open, competitive and transparent tender for selection of a commercial partner to conduct the ISL in line with global best practices.”AIFF has told the Supreme Court that it will conclude the process of finalising a marketing partner by October 15.FSDL’s 15-year contract with AIFF ends December 8, 2025, and the marketing partners have agreed to advance the final tranche of the rights fee of Rs 12.5 crore. The company has crucially also waived its contractual Right of First Negotiation and Right to Match.“This collaborative framework represents a significant step forward in the evolution of Indian football as it ensures that no disruption is caused to the footballing ecosystem, that all stakeholders are given clarity, and that the governance of the sport proceeds in conformity with national and international norms,” AIFF and FSDL said in a joint submission before the SC on Thursday.All parties have been asked by the SC to “reflect” on the proposals, and if agreeable, the court will pronounce judgment on Monday.The crucial matter of AIFF’s constitution, with FIFA, the governing body of world football, threatening to suspend India if there’s no definitive order from SC and ratification by the general body before October 30, is also expected to be finalised next week.The AIFF constitution case has been in the apex court since 2017, when the court directed formulation of a new constitution, one that was submitted by former SC Judge Justice L. Nageswara Rao in 2023.For AIFF, its marketing partners waiving its contractual Right of First Negotiation and Right to Match was a big step forward.""As soon as the order is out, we will appoint one of the big five companies to oversee the tender process and float the tender by September 15,” said a senior official.“A month later, we will have the marketing partners in place, and they will be asked to start the league in December. FSDL giving up its right to match was a big win (for an open and transparent process). If they could match, there was no point in issuing a global tender since not many would have participated.”","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has submitted before the Supreme Court that it proposes to kickstart the season with the Super Cup or another domestic competition.

The Champions League draw for the 36-team league phase will take place in Monaco on Thursday, with defending champions Paris Saint-Germain looking to retain their title after their historic 5-0 victory over Inter Milan in last season's final in Munich. The new format, introduced last season, replaced the traditional group stage with a single league where teams play eight different opponents.PSG finished 15th in the league phase before going on to win the tournament, defeating first-placed Liverpool on penalties in the last 16. They went on to become only the second French team to win the trophy after Marseille's 1993 triumph.""Last season we fulfilled the objective which everybody connected to the club had been dreaming about. But we want to keep on making history and now that would mean winning two Champions Leagues in a row. That is our objective. Last season nobody thought we were capable of winning it and we showed that we were. The dream is to win it again. We know it will be very difficult, but we are delighted to have that as a dream,"" said PSG coach Luis Enrique.PSG's victory ended a 20-year dominance by teams from England, Spain, Germany, and Italy.These four nations still maintain their strong presence with 19 of the 36 teams, including six English clubs thanks to Tottenham Hotspur's Europa League victory.The competition now features teams from only 16 countries out of UEFA's 55 member associations, with three teams coming from France.Only half of the teams in Thursday's draw participated in last season's league phase, bringing fresh faces to the competition.Kairat Almaty from Kazakhstan qualified by defeating Celtic in the play-offs, becoming only the second team from their country to reach the Champions League proper after Astana.Norwegian club Bodo/Glimt qualified for the first time, marking Norway's return to the competition since Rosenborg's appearance in 2007/08.Union Saint-Gilloise secured their first-ever Champions League qualification after winning their first Belgian title in 90 years.Cypriot champions Pafos, featuring former Chelsea and PSG defender David Luiz, also qualified for the first time.""We are the black sheep of the Champions League and the expectation is that we will suffer and lose games, but we will fight, compete and just enjoy the journey,"" said Pafos coach Juan Carlos Carcedo.While Liverpool's top finish in the league phase didn't lead to ultimate success, the next three teams - Barcelona, Arsenal, and Inter - all reached the semi-finals.The financial rewards for Champions League participation have reached new heights, with UEFA projecting total prize money of nearly 2.5 billion euros.Winners can earn over 100 million euros in prize money alone, with additional millions from television rights and coefficient ranking. PSG reportedly earned close to 150 million euros from their victory last season.The final will be played in Budapest, which lies 5,800km west of Almaty by land.The Champions League draw will take place on Thursday August 28, 2025. It will be held in Monaco.The Champions League draw will take place at 9:30pm IST (6pm CET/11pm ET/4pm GMT/5pm UK).Last year the entire draw and award ceremony took 75 minutes to complete so brace yourself as 36 teams get their place in the league phase draw.Each team will be drawn to play eight fixtures, facing two opponents from every pot.Teams from the same country cannot face each other, so Real Madrid cannot play Barcelona.There can be at most two matches against clubs from the same country. For example, Liverpool could be drawn against Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern Munich, but would then be ineligible to face Eintracht Frankfurt.Pot One: Paris Saint-Germain (FRA) - reigning champions, Real Madrid (ESP), Manchester City (ENG), Bayern Munich (GER), Liverpool (ENG), Inter Milan (ITA), Chelsea (ENG), Borussia Dortmund (GER), Barcelona (ESP)Pot Two: Arsenal (ENG), Bayer Leverkusen (GER), Atletico Madrid (ESP), Benfica (POR), Atalanta (ITA), Villarreal (ESP), Juventus (ITA), Eintracht Frankfurt (GER), Club Brugge (BEL)Pot Three: Tottenham Hotspur (ENG), PSV Eindhoven (NED), Ajax (NED), Napoli (ITA), Sporting (POR), Olympiakos (GRE), Slavia Prague (CZE), Bodo/Glimt (NOR), Marseille (FRA)Pot Four: FC Copenhagen (DEN), Monaco (FRA), Galatasaray (TUR), Union Saint-Gilloise (BEL), Qarabag (AZE), Athletic Bilbao (ESP), Newcastle United (ENG), Pafos (CYP), Kairat Almaty (KAZ)The Champions League draw will be LIVE on Sony Network on TV in India and on SonyLiv for live streaming.",UEFA Champions League draw will take place on August 28. 36 teams will be drawn to play eight matches in the league phase.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins. He was pushed from second place to third, with Cassidy in second. Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings. He won two podium spots this season.","All three Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor. Massive congratulations. You are the future of this sport.”Recalling Barnard’s maiden pole, a fan also wrote, “Fantastic season, Taylor, we'll never forget that Monaco pole.”Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Barnard claimed five podiums in his first full season in Formula E.

Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

The Ultimate Performance

NEW DELHI: South Africa captain Temba Bavuma questioned his team’s attitude after they were thrashed by 342 runs against England in the largest defeat in ODI history on Sunday. Chasing 415 to complete a clean sweep of the three-match series, the Proteas were bowled out for just 72 in 20.5 humiliating overs at Southampton.It marked the biggest winning margin in ODI history when batting first, surpassing India’s 317-run victory over Sri Lanka in 2023. South Africa narrowly avoided recording their lowest ODI total of 69 against Australia in 1993. England’s previous largest margin of victory was a 242-run triumph over Australia at Trent Bridge in 2018.Bavuma admitted South Africa’s sloppy fielding, which included several dropped catches, reflected their poor performance.""It's a downer. We were just poor to be honest, in all departments. Fielding is always about attitude, and looking at our fielding and some of the catches you could question where our attitude is,"" Bavuma said.""With the ball at some point something went horribly wrong. The extras as well with the ball, far from ideal.""With the bat it was always going to be tough, and their bowlers really put us under pressure. We didn't have a chance.""To sum it up, a poor game of cricket from us.""South Africa had won the first two games of the series, but Bavuma insisted lack of motivation was not a factor in their embarrassing surrender.""I think as an international sportsman you can't use that as an excuse. Every game you're playing for your country. There have been changes within our team with players rested so our depth has been tested,"" he said.""For those guys it shows how much of a step up it is for international cricket.""We have conversations about our depth and when premium players aren't there, because it takes a squad to go and win trophies.""Although South Africa’s astonishing collapse will take time for Bavuma to process, he took heart from their overall form. Their ODI series win against England came after a recent victory over Australia in the same format.""We are moving forward, we are taking positive strides forward, the team is shaping up nicely,"" Bavuma said.""I think looking at the way we were against Australia, we are starting to answer those question marks about our team.""England’s fifth-highest ODI total of 414-5 proved more than enough. After Jacob Bethell smashed 110 from 82 balls for his maiden professional century and Joe Root compiled a typically efficient 100, Jofra Archer dismantled the South African top order, finishing with 4-18 in nine overs.""It was awesome to see Jofra bowling rockets there. To have that in your side, it's quite frightening,"" England captain Harry Brook said.""We were awesome with the bat, put them under pressure all the way through that innings and the bowling just speaks for itself. It was the ultimate performance.""Amid questions over England fast-tracking Bethell across formats, the 21-year-old all-rounder made his mark with 13 fours and three sixes. Brook praised him, saying:""That's just the beginning. I said that to him at lunch. Everyone knows how good he is. I'm glad he's got that first century and hopefully now the floodgates open.""",South Africa captain Temba Bavuma questions his team's attitude.

NEW DELHI: South Africa endured a nightmarish outing in Southampton on Sunday, slumping to the heaviest defeat in ODI history as England romped to a record 342-run victory. The tourists were bundled out for a paltry 72 in just 20.5 overs while chasing a daunting 415, a collapse that underlined the sheer dominance of Jofra Archer and the destructive brilliance of Jacob Bethell.The margin of defeat eclipsed the previous record of 317 runs set by India against Sri Lanka in 2023, making it the biggest win in ODI history when batting first. For South Africa, it was an embarrassment narrowly shy of their lowest ODI total of 69 against Australia back in 1993.England’s commanding position was built on their fifth-highest ODI score, 414/5. Bethell, the 21-year-old left-hander fast-tracked into all formats, played a sparkling knock of 110 off 82 balls — his maiden ODI century — decorated with 13 fours and three sixes. Joe Root added a fluent 100, while Jos Buttler (62 not out) and opener Jamie Smith (62) piled on the misery for South Africa’s bowlers.But it was Archer who stole the show with the ball. Charging in at over 90 mph, the fast bowler ripped through the top order with figures of 4-18 in nine overs. He removed four of South Africa’s top five, including skipper Aiden Markram in the opening over and the in-form Matthew Breetzke, to leave the Proteas reeling at 18/5.Brydon Carse and Adil Rashid combined to wipe out the tail, with Rashid collecting three wickets.Only Corbin Bosch provided token resistance with 20, while Temba Bavuma’s absence through injury meant the visitors were effectively a batsman short.The result was a welcome boost for England, who had already lost the three-match series after defeats at Headingley and Lord’s. More importantly, it marked a return to form for Archer, whose fitness remains central to England’s hopes in the upcoming Ashes series.For South Africa, the humiliation will sting deeply. Their shot at redemption comes quickly, with a T20I series against England beginning on Wednesday, but this crushing defeat will linger as one of the darkest days in their ODI history.",England beat South Africa by 342 runs in the third ODI in Southampton.

What is BCCI’s Serious Injury Replacement Rule?



According to the BCCI’s guidelines:

The injury must be sustained during play within the designated playing area.

It should be the result of an external blow, leading to a fracture, deep cut, or dislocation.

The injury must render the player unavailable for the remainder of the match.

The replacement must be a like-for-like cricketer.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra wicketkeeper-batter Saurabh Nawale etched his name into the history books, becoming the first cricketer to be used as a ‘serious injury replacement’ in Indian domestic cricket.The landmark moment unfolded during the Duleep Trophy semi-final between West Zone and Central Zone when Nawale was drafted in to replace Harvik Desai , who suffered a quadricep injury. With the consent of Central Zone skipper Rajat Patidar, West Zone invoked the new regulation recently introduced by the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) for the 2025–26 domestic season.The rule permits teams to field a like-for-like replacement if a player sustains a serious injury during the course of a match. While Nawale’s historic appearance did not translate into major runs — he scored just nine after adding a 32-run stand with Yashasvi Jaiswal —the moment signaled a new era in Indian cricket’s approach to player safety and fairness.The introduction of the rule came after growing calls during India’s tour of England earlier this year, when players such as Rishabh Pant and Chris Woakes were forced to continue despite carrying visible injuries.By becoming the first beneficiary of the regulation, Nawale’s inclusion may well set a precedent for how teams manage injuries in high-stakes matches. While his batting contribution was modest, the bigger takeaway was that player welfare has been placed at the forefront of domestic cricket.",Saurabh Nawale becomes the first cricketer to be used as a ‘serious injury replacement’ in Indian domestic cricket.

With half their side back in the dressing room, North Zone’s hopes of overhauling a 258-run deficit on the final day looked as bleak as the overcast weather on Sunday.The cloudy conditions, however, suited South Zone perfectly, as they turned a fine display of seam bowling into a ticket to the Duleep Trophy final. At the BCCI Centre of Excellence, South set up a title clash against Central Zone, with both teams progressing by virtue of their first-innings leads.With the result already clear, South and North players shook hands half an hour before tea. Meanwhile, the other game between West and Central was called off at tea.North’s faint hopes were dashed early by South medium pacer V Koushik, who removed centurion Shubham Khajuria (128 off 252 balls, 20x4, 1x6) in the second over of the day, uprooting his middle stump.Sahil Lotra (19) and Mayank Dagar (31) tried to offer resistance, with Dagar freely brandishing his bat, hitting some boundaries and rotating the strike. However, South’s bowlers remained incisive under the overcast skies.M Nidheesh (3/82) ended the 47-run partnership by knocking over Lotra’s middle stump. Dagar followed in the next over, chopping a Nidheesh delivery onto his stumps. Yudhvir Singh later gave a catch to Mohit Kale at silly point off Tanay Thyagarajan.The last-wicket pair of Auqib Nabi (10) and Anshul Kamboj (11 not out) held out for a while before Nabi fell to Gurjapneet Singh (4/96), giving South a commanding 175-run lead after bowling North out for 361 in 100.1 overs.In South’s second innings, first-innings centurion N Jagadeesan scored an unbeaten 52 off 69 balls (6x4), helping the team declare at 95/1 in 24.4 overs and bring the game to a close.Central Zone, already assured of a final berth, completed formalities with a 162-run first-innings lead after posting 600 in 164.3 overs. Off-spinner and man of the match Saransh Jain raised hopes with a five-wicket haul (5/84) in the second innings, but half-centuries from Yashasvi Jaiswal (64) and Tanush Kotian (40 not out) denied West Zone a win.West, bowled out for 438 in their first innings, reached 216/8 in 53.3 overs in the second.

Shreyas Iyer’s India Future: Comeback or Curtains? | Greenstone Lobo predicts

Poll Do you think Shreyas Iyer deserved a spot in the Asia Cup squad? Yes, based on his recent form No, there are better options

NEW DELHI: Star India batter Shreyas Iyer has spoken candidly about the mental challenges players face when left out of squads, admitting that the frustration often stems from self-belief and hard work. His comments come just days after he was overlooked for India’s squad for the upcoming Asia Cup 2025 in the UAE, a decision that surprised many given his recent form.Speaking on the iQOO India podcast, Iyer reflected on the emotions players grapple with during such moments. “It is only frustrating when you know that you deserve to be in the team, in the playing XI. At that time, it’s frustrating,” he said.However, the 30-year-old stressed the importance of maintaining perspective and prioritising team success. “But at the same time, when you know that someone is performing and playing consistently for the team and bringing their best, you support them. And eventually, the goal is for the team to win. When the team is winning, everyone is happy.”Iyer, who has been named captain of India A for the upcoming multi-day series against Australia A, further underlined the value of integrity and work ethic, regardless of opportunities.“Even if you don’t get a chance, you have to make sure that you do your work ethically. It’s not like you do it only when someone is watching. Even when no one is watching, you have to keep doing your work,” he added.While Iyer’s absence from the Asia Cup squad may be a talking point, India’s preparations for their title defense are in full swing. The team unveiled their new jersey on Sunday through a stirring video montage and continued their high-intensity practice sessions at the ICC Academy in Dubai.Defending champions India, eight-time winners of the tournament, open their campaign against hosts UAE on September 10, before facing Pakistan on September 14 and Oman on September 19.",Shreyas Iyer has spoken candidly about the mental challenges players face when left out of squads.

- Depay makes Dutch history -

NEW DELHI: Mikel Merino scored a hat-trick as a majestic Spain thumped Turkey 6-0 away in World Cup qualifying on Sunday, while a brilliant Florian Wirtz free-kick helped Germany beat Northern Ireland 3-1 to get their bid up and running. European champions Spain were in unstoppable form in the central Turkish city of Konya, claiming their second biggest-ever away win in World Cup qualifying as Arsenal midfielder Merino scored his first professional hat-trick.Barcelona playmaker Pedri Gonzalez opened the scoring inside six minutes and later completed the scoring, with Ferran Torres netting the visitors' other goal.The quality of Merino's strikes was remarkable, with his first coming at the end of a superb team move and his second a controlled finish from a Pedri assist. He completed his triple with a curling shot into the top corner.The one blemish on the night's work for Spain was the withdrawal of Nico Williams due to an apparent thigh injury, but Luis de la Fuente's team are already clear at the top of qualifying Group E with six points from two games.""I'm very happy for winning, to pick up six points, for doing it in this way, and for scoring three goals, which is not normal -- the first hat-trick of my career,"" said Merino.The group winners will qualify directly for the finals, with the runners-up progressing to a play-off phase.Georgia and Turkey come next on three points each, with the former beating Bulgaria 3-0 in Tbilisi thanks to goals by captain Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Nika Gagnidze and Georges Mikautadze.Germany were under pressure after losing their opening qualifier 2-0 in Slovakia on Thursday, and it took them until the final quarter of their home meeting with Northern Ireland in Cologne before they could secure the victory.Serge Gnabry gave the hosts an early lead only for Isaac Price of West Bromwich Albion to equalise before half-time.The home fans were unhappy with Julian Nagelsmann's team, but they eventually retook the lead on 69 minutes when substitute Nadiem Amiri turned in David Raum's cross.Liverpool star Wirtz, playing in his home city, then took centre stage by converting a free-kick in style to seal Germany's first win in Group A.""We knew it was a catastrophe (in the) last game and we wanted to do things better,"" Wirtz told Germany's RTL network.""It was a good performance (which) we can definitely build on.""They and Northern Ireland both have three points, while Slovakia lead the way on six points after Tomas Rigo's late goal clinched a 1-0 victory in Luxembourg.Memphis Depay became the Netherlands' all-time top goalscorer with a brace in their 3-2 win in Lithuania in Group G.Depay, who now plays in Brazil for Corinthians, scored his 51st and 52nd international goals to move clear of Robin van Persie, with whom he had been tied in first place on half a century of strikes for the Oranje.The 31-year-old turned in Cody Gakpo's cutback for the opener before Quinten Timber netted the second goal for the Netherlands in Kaunas.They appeared to be on easy street, but Torino midfielder Gvidas Gineitis pulled one back and Edvinas Girdvainis headed in the equaliser before the break for the team ranked 143rd in the world.Depay, though, rescued the Netherlands by heading in a Denzel Dumfries cross just after the hour mark.Ronald Koeman's side have 10 points after four matches and are ahead of Poland on goal difference with a game in hand.Poland won 3-1 at home to Finland in Chorzow with Matty Cash, captain Robert Lewandowski and Jakub Kaminski netting before Benjamin Kaellman pulled one back for Finland, who are three points behind the leading duo in third.Belgium recorded a second 6-0 win in as many matches in Group J as they swept aside Kazakhstan at Anderlecht's stadium in Brussels. Kevin De Bruyne scored twice and is now his country's second-top goal-scorer of all time behind Romelu Lukaku.Jeremy Doku of Manchester City also bagged a brace, with Nicolas Raskin and Thomas Meunier netting the other goals.North Macedonia beat Liechtenstein 5-0 in the same group and they are top with 11 points from five matches, one ahead of Belgium -- who have a game in hand -- and Wales.",Mikel Merino scores a hat-trick as a majestic Spain thumped Turkey 6-0 away in World Cup qualifying.

At least the lads kept their shape lying down!""Fortunately, no injuries were reported, and the bees eventually moved on, allowing the game to resume.While weather delays, power outages, or pitch invasions are not uncommon in football, incidents involving wildlife are far rarer, though Africa has seen occasional interruptions from animals such as birds, dogs, and even cows wandering into stadiums.For the players, the bee invasion was a moment of real tension, but for global audiences, it became an instant viral clip, showcasing the unpredictability of live sport.The match later continued without further disruption, but fans will likely remember the bizarre stoppage more than the final scoreline.","A massive swarm of bees disrupted a football match in Tanzania.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

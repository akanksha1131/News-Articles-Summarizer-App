Handshake drama becomes ugly! India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2025 in DANGER?

NEW DELHI: The Asia Cup continues to be overshadowed by the handshake controversy that erupted after India’s win over Pakistan on September 14, when Indian players walked off without the customary post-match greetings.The fallout, already sparking heated debates and even a delay in Pakistan’s clash against the UAE on Wednesday, took another twist on Thursday after former Pakistan pacer Mohammad Amir weighed in with a pointed social media post.Amir shared a picture of himself alongside Indian batting legend Virat Kohli and wrote: “One thing is for sure, Virat is the best player and human being in Indian cricket history. Respect.”The remark, while appearing complimentary to Kohli, was widely read as a subtle dig at the current Indian squad embroiled in the handshake saga.The post quickly went viral, igniting fresh conversations among fans on both sides of the border.The controversy has already spilled onto the tournament’s scheduling. Wednesday’s Pakistan–UAE game began an hour late, as the PCB threatened to pull out and demanded the removal of match referee Andy Pycroft , who officiated the India clash. Talks with the ICC eventually calmed tensions, and Pakistan went on to defeat the UAE by 41 runs, setting up a rematch with India in the Super Four.Meanwhile, pacer Haris Rauf promised that Pakistan would deliver a stronger performance against their arch-rivals, saying: “Fans have expectations, and we will try to live up to them.”But for now, it is Amir’s viral post that has added yet another dramatic layer to an already charged Asia Cup.",Former Pakistan pacer Mohammad Amir takes a dig at Indian captain Virat Kohli.

NEW DELHI: In a heartbreaking turn of events, Sri Lankan spinner Dunith Wellalage learned of his father’s sudden demise only after helping his team secure a six-wicket win over Afghanistan in the Asia Cup Group B clash in Abu Dhabi on Thursday, September 18.The 22-year-old spinner was unaware that his father, Suranga Wellalage, had passed away earlier in Colombo while he was on the field. According to reports, the tragic news was conveyed to him by Sri Lanka’s team manager moments after the post-match formalities concluded. Wellalage immediately left the squad to return home and be with his family.The young cricketer’s grief adds a somber note to what was otherwise a crucial victory for Sri Lanka, who advanced to the Super Four stage unbeaten. This development, however, throws uncertainty over Wellalage’s further participation in the tournament, with Sri Lanka scheduled to face Bangladesh on September 20, Pakistan on September 23, and India on September 26.Thursday’s match was Wellalage’s fifth T20 international and his first of the 2025 Asia Cup. Though he struggled with the ball — conceding 49 runs in his four overs, including five sixes in the final over to a rampaging Mohammed Nabi — his teammates rallied to script a successful chase. Kusal Mendis’s unbeaten 74 and Kamindu Mendis ’s late cameo ensured Sri Lanka crossed the target of 170 with eight balls to spare.Wellalage has already built a reputation as one of Sri Lanka’s brightest young prospects, with standout ODI spells against India, including his career-best 5/27 last month in Colombo. But Thursday’s triumph will forever be bittersweet for the youngster, who went from celebrating a team win to facing personal tragedy in the space of minutes.For now, the cricketing world extends its condolences to Dunith Wellalage and his family during this difficult time.",Dunith Wellalage learned of his father's sudden demise only after helping his team secure a six-wicket win over Afghanistan in the Asia Cup Group B clash in Abu Dhabi.

Haaland’s half-century

Frankfurt hit five, Leverkusen denied

Brugge stun Monaco, Sporting cruise

Marcus Rashford scored his first goals for Barcelona as the Spanish champions launched their Champions League campaign with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Newcastle United at St James’ Park on Thursday.Rashford, on loan from Manchester United, broke the deadlock just before the hour mark by heading in Jules Kounde’s cross, before unleashing a thunderous strike from distance to double the lead midway through the second half. Anthony Gordon pulled one back for Newcastle, but Xavi’s men, semi-finalists last season, held firm.“It’s an amazing experience playing for Barcelona. I’ve always been a huge admirer of the club. We just want to win as much as possible,” said Rashford.At the Etihad, Erling Haaland continued his remarkable scoring record as Manchester City, the 2023 winners, overcame Napoli 2-0. The Serie A champions’ hopes were dented when skipper Giovanni Di Lorenzo was sent off in the first half for bringing down Haaland.Pep Guardiola’s side capitalised, with Haaland nodding in a Phil Foden assist early in the second half for his 50th Champions League goal in just 49 appearances.Jeremy Doku added a second as City extended Napoli’s winless run in England to 13 games.“The numbers speak for themselves,” Guardiola said. “Along with Ronaldo and Messi, Erling is there. In terms of goals, he is unbelievable.”Eintracht Frankfurt were the night’s biggest winners, thrashing Galatasaray 5-1. After Davinson Sanchez’s own goal levelled Yunus Akgun’s opener, Can Uzun and Jonathan Burkardt scored in first-half stoppage time. Burkardt struck again after the break before Ansgar Knauff sealed victory.Elsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen rescued a 2-2 draw at FC Copenhagen thanks to Pantelis Hatzidiakos’s stoppage-time own goal. Alejandro Grimaldo’s free-kick had earlier cancelled out Jordan Larsson’s opener, but Robert’s late strike for Copenhagen looked decisive until the dramatic finale.Club Brugge, last-16 qualifiers in 2024, produced a statement 4-1 win over Monaco. After Maghnes Akliouche missed a penalty for the visitors, Nicolo Tresoldi, Raphael Onyedika and Hans Vanaken all scored before Mamadou Diakhon added a fourth. Ansu Fati’s late goal was only consolation for Monaco.Portuguese champions Sporting Lisbon also impressed, brushing aside Kazakhstan’s Kairat Almaty 4-1. Francisco Trincao netted twice while Alisson Santos and Geovany Quenda struck in quick succession. Edmilson replied for Kairat, who face Real Madrid next.","Marcus Rashford scores his first goals for Barcelona in 2-1 win over Newcastle.

Will they? Won't they? The guesswork continued for days over Pakistan's participation in the ongoing Asia Cup . To make matters worse, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) decided against allowing the team to board the bus for the stadium, for their match against UAE, at the final hour. Thus ensued plenty of back-channel talks and an eventful day of dialogue between PCB, International Cricket Council (ICC) and Asian Cricket Council (ACC).PCB president Mohsin Naqvi and Salman Naseer led the negotiations on their behalf while Sanjog Gupta, the ICC CEO, represented the global cricket body in the negotiations.As a result, the match, due to begin at 6.30pm local time (8:00pm IST), was delayed by an hour.But when the two captains finally lined-up for the toss, match referee Andy Pycroft - the hottest keyword in the last four days - was in position before the coin got a flip. A lot of drama, multiple emails, phone calls, negotiations and allegations preceded Pakistan-UAE toss as Mohsin Naqvi-led PCB were adamant on getting Pycroft removed from the roster for violation of Code of Conduct.In its first email to the ICC on September 15, a day after the India-Pakistan game, the PCB mentioned an ""incident"" - read toss - where Code of Conduct wasn't followed. They questioned the role of match referee Pycroft as the two captains Suryakumar Yadav and Salman Agha didn't shake hands - as is custom. ICC immediately agreed to look into the matter and after doing its due diligence, a response was sent to the PCB stating Pycroft performed his duty well and didn't violate any code of conduct.It was further communicated that he was following the instructions he got from the ACC, chaired by Naqvi, regarding no handshake at toss. The ICC further highlighted that Pycroft handled the situation well and ensured there was no awkward situation on live television. The PCB, however, didn't seem satisfied with the response and responded with the demand of Pycroft's removal from the roster. They added that they would withdraw from the tournament if the Zimbabwean official was not removed from Pakistan's matches.ICC, however, stood its ground and reiterated that Pycroft is not guilty of any code of conduct violation, and asserted they can't change officials as per the demands of any team as it would set a dangerous precedent. When PCB's withdrawal threat didn't work, the ACC also got involved with the same request but ICC didn't budge from its stance once again.As far as the men handling the communication from the Dubai office were concerned, the Pycroft chapter was closed on September 16 but a fresh email from the PCB on September 17 gave a different angle. For the first two days - September 15 and September 16 - all the chatter was around the conduct at toss but on September 17, PCB said there were code of conduct violations during and after the India vs Pakistan match, and again questioned Pycroft's role. In response, the ICC asked PCB for more information and are yet to get a response.Amid all the drama, Pycroft came up with a suggestion and called for a meeting with Pakistan captain Agha and manager Naveed Akram Cheema. It was also attended by coach Mike Hesson in the match referee room at the Dubai International Stadium and Pycroft is learnt to have spoken to the Pakistan camp regarding the possible miscommunication which happened. Was this an apology, as the PCB statement claims? ""There was no question of any apology. Especially from someone who did no wrong,"" says a well-placed source. A video of the meeting is also doing rounds but the audio has been muted.Six emails, a lot of chatter but the only thing which changed was the start time of the Pakistan-UAE contest. Pycroft officiated the fixture and is set to continue doing that for the remainder of the tournament. What next for PCB? They first need to respond to ICC with more information as their previous claims have clearly fallen flat.","PCB demanded match referee Andy Pycroft's removal, alleging code of conduct violations during the India-Pakistan match.

NEW DELHI: Amid all the drama, chaos, and delays surrounding Pakistan’s Asia Cup campaign, the team finally made it to the Dubai International Stadium to take on the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday. Despite a late start and the lingering controversy from their group-stage loss to India and the handshake saga, Pakistan delivered a strong all-round performance, securing a comfortable 41-run victory and booking their place in the Super Four.With this win, Pakistan not only progress to the Super Four but also set up a high-stakes rematch against India on Sunday at the same venue, promising another thrilling contest.The match started an hour late as Pakistan threatened a pull-out after the handshake fiasco during the previous game against India before Salman Agha's team climbed down and showed up for the game.Put into bat, Pakistan had a shaky start.

Afridi had previously impressed with 33 not out, including four sixes, against India.Junaid Siddique starred with the ball for UAE, picking up four vital wickets for 34 runs, while Simranjeet Singh claimed three more.Chasing 147, UAE tried to adopt a cautious approach to avoid another low total, but their slow scoring made the target unrealistic.Rahul Chopra (35) and Dhruv Parashar (20) added 48 for the fourth wicket, but it wasn’t enough.Pakistan maintained control throughout, and from 85 for 3 after 14 overs, UAE collapsed to 105 all out in 17.4 overs.","Pakistan beat United Arab Emirates by 41 runs to progress to Super Four.

Poll Do you think Pakistan will overcome their batting challenges against India? Yes, they will improve No, they will struggle

NEW DELHI: Fresh off the handshake controversy and the recently resolved stand-off with match referee Andy Pycroft , Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha struck a defiant note ahead of the blockbuster Super Four clash against India, declaring that his team is “ready for any challenge.”The tension between the two sides has spilled beyond the boundary rope. Their group-stage meeting in Dubai, played under the shadow of the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, had already triggered calls for a boycott. India thrashed Pakistan by seven wickets and walked straight back to the dressing room, refusing to engage in the customary handshakes. Pakistan’s players responded by skipping the post-match presentation.Ex-cricketers lined up to criticise India’s stance, while the PCB blamed Pycroft for a “breach of conduct” and demanded his removal. The ICC’s refusal escalated the drama, even forcing Pakistan to cancel a scheduled press conference. Matters worsened before the UAE fixture when the team threatened a boycott, staying back at their Dubai Marina hotel until just 30 minutes before the toss. The standoff caused an unprecedented one-hour delay.On the field, Pakistan initially faltered again with the bat, reeling at 128/8 before Shaheen Afridi’s late fireworks — 29 off 14 balls with two sixes and a four — lifted them to 146/9. Though modest, the total proved more than enough, with Salman leading from the front alongside Abrar Ahmed and Saim Ayub as Pakistan’s spinners throttled UAE to seal a 41-run victory and a Super Four berth.Salman, however, was candid about his team’s shortcomings. “We got the job done, but we still need to improve our batting in the middle order. That’s been a concern… we’re still just finding our way to 150. If we bat well in the middle overs, we can push it to 170 no matter the opposition. Shaheen’s batting has improved a lot — he’s already great with the ball,” he said.But it was his rallying cry that set the stage for Sunday’s showdown: “We’re ready for any challenge, and if we keep playing the way we have over the last four months, we’ll be good against any side.”",Pakistan face India in their Super Four clash on Sunday.

'My job is to play': Haris Rauf stays calm as Pakistan ride out Asia Cup drama

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ramiz Raja has accused International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee Andy Pycroft of blatant bias, branding him a “favourite for the Indians” in the wake of the handshake controversy and mounting tensions at the Asia Cup in Dubai.Pakistan’s players had refused to leave their hotel ahead of their must-win fixture against the UAE on Wednesday, demanding Pycroft’s removal after the fallout from their heated clash with India. Although they eventually received clearance to play, the game was delayed by an hour. The PCB also cancelled the pre-match press conference.Speaking at a joint press conference alongside PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi, Ramiz Raja did not hold back, questioning Pycroft’s track record. “What’s interesting is… Andy Pycroft is favourite [for the Indians]. Whenever I host tosses, he’s always a permanent fixture over there,” Raja charged.Raja argued that Pycroft had been disproportionately appointed for India’s matches, raising doubts about the ICC’s neutrality. “This is something blatant for me because, though I thought he had refereed several matches, stats seemingly show something one-sided.It should not be like this. This is a neutral platform, which is why there are referees and match officials. However, I felt that he was fixed there. But I hope that better sense prevails,” he added.The PCB alleged Pycroft had directly prohibited India captain Suryakumar Yadav and Pakistan skipper Salman Agha from shaking hands after their high-voltage encounter, later classifying the incident as a “miscommunication.” In a strongly-worded statement on X, the board said: “ICC’s controversial match referee Andy Pycroft has apologised to the manager and captain of the Pakistani cricket team… The ICC has expressed its readiness to investigate the violation of the Code of Conduct.”However, ICC sources have since refuted Pakistan’s claims, clarifying that no formal investigation has been initiated and that Pycroft was not guilty of any breach. The apology, they stressed, was due to a venue manager’s error.Despite the uproar, Pycroft returned to duty at the Dubai International Stadium, officiating Pakistan’s clash against the UAE, leaving the controversy far from settled.",Former Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ramiz Raja has accused International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee Andy Pycroft of blatant bias.

Tense faces! Pakistan cricket team arrive at ICC Academy | Will they boycott Asia Cup?

Poll Who do you think is currently the better spinner in international cricket? Kuldeep Yadav Axar Patel

Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma are inseparable in the nets | Exclusive visuals from Dubai

Watching India and Pakistan train at the nets reveals the gulf between the two sides.It starts with the basics — discipline and work ethic — which the Pakistan side lacks.On Tuesday, at the ICC Cricket Academy in Dubai, India and Pakistan trained at the same venue in different time slots. But even the process of training highlighted the gulf between the two teams.India's bus arrived at the venue at 5:20 pm (local time), 40 minutes before their scheduled start. India’s support staff, including side-arm throwers D Raghavendra, Nuwan Seneviratne, and Dayanand Garani, had reached 40 minutes before the team.The troika got to work immediately, setting everything in order. The moment Gautam Gambhir’s team arrived, they slipped into rhythm seamlessly.Two and a half hours later, around 7:50 pm, Pakistan’s bus arrived with just 10 minutes to go before their session. At the same time, the UAE team, who had just finished their nets, were leaving the venue. The Pakistan players stopped to banter with them, as many of the UAE cricketers are of Pakistani origin and had played with them back home.Another 30 minutes passed as Pakistan struggled to figure out what to do. They looked all at sea before captain Salman Ali Agha pulled a football out of his kitbag, and they started playing.To be honest, they were as clueless with football as they were with bat in hand against India on Sunday. Most looked like club-level batters against the Indian attack.Pakistan’s batters were miserable against India’s spin trio — Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy and Axar Patel.After the handshake-gate drama, Pakistan coach Mike Hesson was coaxed into defending his players.“It’s more the accuracy and the pressure that they (Indian spinners) build. When you build up a lot of dot balls, sometimes your mind plays tricks and you play big shots. So it’s not that they can’t pick spin. It’s the fact we struggle to rotate strike and relieve pressure. That’s why dismissals happened in clusters,” Hesson told TimesofIndia.com.Back at Tuesday’s nets, Indian batter Tilak Varma, who has a history of struggling against spin and looked vulnerable against Pakistan too, was facing Kuldeep and Varun in the far nets, with Gautam Gambhir and Sitanshu Kotak keeping a close eye.After 45 exhausting minutes, Tilak was drained and on his knees before being allowed to leave the nets.At the same time, Pakistan’s Saim Ayub, one of their brighter prospects, stood away from the football group, doing shadow practice with Hesson.Meanwhile, Kotak emerged from India’s dressing room with a blackboard clearly listing who would do what in training. In contrast, Pakistan’s session was trial and error.Fakhar Zaman, undone by Axar Patel’s guile on Sunday, was facing Mohammad Nawaz — whom Hesson had once called the world’s best spinner — and was hitting him with ease. Yet Fakhar again struggled against Axar, underlining the difference in quality between the two left-arm spinners.In this era, when every team has at least two side-arm throwers, Pakistan have none. As one veteran Pakistani journalist summed it up: “Hum abhi wahaan nahi pahunche hain (We haven’t reached that level yet).”The six-hour nets marathon — three each for India and Pakistan — can be summed up by Rohit Sharma’s words during the 2019 ODI World Cup, when asked what advice he would give to Pakistan’s struggling batters. Smiling, Rohit had said: “Agar main Pakistan ka coach bana to bilkul bataunga, abhi kya bataunga (If I become Pakistan’s coach, I’ll surely tell them, but not now).”Six years later, the gulf between India and Pakistan cricket has only widened — something that was clearly visible last Sunday, when the so-called rivalry was buried in Dubai’s desert.","On Tuesday, at the ICC Cricket Academy in Dubai, India and Pakistan trained at the same venue in different time slots.

Handshake drama becomes ugly! India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2025 in DANGER?

Poll Do you agree with Anil Chaudhary's statement that the handshake controversy is unnecessary? Strongly agree Agree Disagree

NEW DELHI: The ongoing Asia Cup has been overshadowed by the fallout from the handshake row and Pakistan Cricket Board’s escalating confrontations with the ICC. Former international umpire Anil Chaudhary has now weighed in, dismissing the controversy as “unnecessary” and accusing Pakistan of using it to shift the spotlight after their defeat to India.“I think that after losing the match, it was a part of turning things around. Otherwise, in any law book, in any ICC's playing conditions, there is nothing in writing,” Chaudhary told ANI. “The handshake controversy you are referring to started about 15-20 years ago. The captain used to shake hands before. So, I think all that is unnecessarily created, and there is no need for it.”The incident erupted after India beat Pakistan by seven wickets in Dubai on Sunday and the Indian players chose not to engage in post-match handshakes. Pakistan reacted sharply, boycotting the presentation ceremony and later filing a complaint against ICC match referee Andy Pycroft , accusing him of violating the spirit of cricket. The ICC, however, refused to act on the complaint.Chaudhary was blunt in his assessment of the PCB’s move: “I think the people who complained also knew that there was no point in doing this in the field.By doing this, they will know that nothing is going to happen.”The PCB’s protests escalated into threats of pulling out of their must-win clash against the UAE, demanding Pycroft’s removal. On Wednesday, Pakistan delayed leaving their team hotel in Dubai, forcing the match to start an hour late.Chaudhary, however, defended Pycroft: “All these are unnecessary things. He is a seasoned and old referee from the ICC elite panel. He is a very well-known player of Zimbabwe, and his track record is so good.”As Pakistan advanced to the Super Four after beating the UAE, the cricketing narrative remains entangled in off-field theatrics, with Chaudhary’s remarks reinforcing the sense that the handshake row was more politics than sport.","Former international umpire Anil Chaudhary has dismissed the handshake controversy as ‘unnecessary’ The incident erupted after India beat Pakistan by seven wickets in Dubai on Sunday and the Indian players chose not to engage in post-match handshakes.

Asia Cup: Handshake gate, Pakistan’s Super 4 entry and India vs Pakistan build-up

Watch:

Poll Do you think the delay in the match affected UAE's performance? Yes, it disrupted their focus. No, they handled it well.

NEW DELHI: The Asia Cup Group A fixture between Pakistan and the UAE in Dubai on Wednesday was already surrounded by drama due to a delayed start, but the evening took an even more concerning turn when on-field umpire Ruchira Palliyaguruge was struck on the ear by an accidental throw.The incident occurred in the sixth over of UAE’s chase of Pakistan’s 146 when a return throw to the bowler hit the Sri Lankan umpire on his left ear. With his back turned, Palliyaguruge appeared dazed and immediately drew concern from the fielders. Pakistan’s players rushed towards him, and the team physio was called to provide treatment. After a brief delay, the reserve umpire stepped in as Palliyaguruge left the field for further checks.On Thursday, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) released a video showing the team’s manager visiting the umpire at the hospital to enquire about his condition. The gesture was widely appreciated, reflecting sportsmanship beyond the boundaries of the game.Despite the disruption, Pakistan regrouped to secure a 41-run victory, booking their place in the Super Four alongside India from Group A. Fakhar Zaman’s fighting half-century (50 off 36 balls) and Shaheen Shah Afridi’s late cameo (29* off 14) lifted Pakistan to 146/9.UAE’s bowlers, particularly Junaid Siddique (4/18) and Simranjeet Singh Kang (3/18), kept the contest tight.In reply, UAE faltered against Pakistan’s spinners, with Abrar Ahmed and Saim Ayub striking early. The hosts were eventually bowled out for 105 in 17.4 overs, giving Pakistan a comfortable victory.The umpire’s injury added a dramatic twist to a contest already marred by pre-match delays and threats of a Pakistan boycott.",Pakistan beat UAE by 41 runs in their Asia Cup Group A fixture.

NEW DELHI: Veteran all-rounder Mohammad Nabi unleashed a stunning display of death-overs hitting to revive Afghanistan’s hopes in their must-win Asia Cup Group B clash against Sri Lanka at the Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium on Thursday. The 40-year-old blasted a whirlwind 60 off just 22 balls, smashing five towering sixes in a single over to propel Afghanistan from a precarious position to a competitive total of 169/8.Nabi’s fireworks with the bat came almost poetically on the eve of the anniversary of Yuvraj Singh ’s iconic six-sixes assault against Stuart Broad during the 2007 ICC T20 World Cup.At 120/7 after 18 overs, Afghanistan’s innings seemed headed for collapse, especially after Nuwan Thushara ripped through their top order with a fiery 4/18 spell. But Nabi, the longest-serving member of the Afghan side, turned the game on its head with an astonishing assault in the last two overs — plundering 46 runs, including 32 off the final over bowled by Dunith Wellalage.Nabi’s 35-run stand with skipper Rashid Khan (24) was the highest partnership of the innings. Wellalage dropped Nabi once in the deep — a costly miss — before being at the receiving end of five cleanly struck sixes in the final over, one coming off a no-ball.Nabi was run out on the last ball, but not before ensuring Afghanistan had a total to defend.Earlier, Afghanistan started briskly with 26 runs in the first two overs, but Thushara’s incisive powerplay burst removed Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Karim Janat and Sediqullah Atal to reduce them to 45/3. The innings lost steam as Sri Lanka’s fielding brilliance — a sharp relay catch from Kusal Perera and a stunning grab by Dushmantha Chameera — kept pegging Afghanistan back.Rashid briefly counter-attacked with two boundaries and a no-look six off Dasun Shanaka before falling to Thushara. Nabi then launched his counter-assault, cracking three consecutive boundaries off Chameera and eventually raising his fifty off just 20 balls — the joint-fastest T20I fifty for Afghanistan.Nabi’s 60 made him only the second 40-plus player after Chris Gayle and Mohammad Hafeez to score a T20I fifty against a full-member side. Afghanistan’s 169/8 also became the third-highest total by a full-member side after losing six wickets for under 80 in T20Is.For Sri Lanka, the 32 runs conceded by Wellalage in that over was their second-most expensive in T20I history, behind the 36-run over smashed by Kieron Pollard off Akila Dananjaya in 2021.Nabi’s incredible assault has not just revived Afghanistan’s innings — it has reignited their hopes of reaching the Super Fours.",Mohammad Nabi scores 60 off just 22 balls to revive Afghanistan's hopes.

TimesofIndia.com

In an interesting development, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has sent a strong email to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) over the violations in the Players and Match Officials Area (PMOA) before their match against the hosts UAE in the ongoing Asia Cup at the Dubai International Stadium on September 17.It is understood that ICC CEO Sanjog Gupta wrote the email to PCB, in which he detailed how filming in the PMOA area was a serious violation.Well-placed sources have informedthat the PCB insisted on recording the entire conversation between match referee Andy Pycroft, Pakistan captain Salman Agha, and coach Mike Hesson.When they were asked not to do that in the PMOA area, the PCB threatened to pull out of the match again.To ensure the Asia Cup fixture wasn't compromised, other stakeholders allowed the PCB to have their way, but their actions — statements on Pycroft and the release of footage on social media — have not gone down well.It is learnt that PCB media manager wanted to carry his phone in the PMOA area and when he was objected, blackmail tactics were used again before the match.While Pycroft and ICC wanted to clear any misunderstanding, it is understood that the PCB wanted to make a spectacle out of the meeting that took place in the PMOA area of the venue before the fixture against UAE.It remains to be seen how the PCB responds to the strongly-worded email, as they are yet to furnish details in response to another email sent by the global cricket body to the PCB on September 17 — the day the drama unfolded and the fixture was delayed by an hour.","The International Cricket Council (ICC) has sent a strong email to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) over the violations in the Players and Match Officials Area (PMOA) before their match against the hosts UAE in the ongoing Asia Cup.

'KHADOOS' BRAND OF CRICKET

THE BOND WITH SKY

NEW DELHI: When cricketer Shubham Ranjane left the bustling ‘city of dreams’ Mumbai a few years ago, he didn’t just leave behind his home and parents — he left behind a rich family legacy. Shubham is the third cricketer from the third generation of the Ranjane family. His grandfather, Vasant Ranjane , a former India cricketer who featured in seven Test matches between 1958 and 1964, and his father, Subash Ranjane, a former first-class cricketer who also represented India A, were the first two.Now, Shubham is proudly carrying that legacy forward.Breaking into the Mumbai side is never easy. Shubham had always wanted to be a fast bowler like his grandfather, who famously took the wickets of legends such as Garfield Sobers, Frank Worrell, Conrad Hunte and Rohan Kanhai. As a young Mumbai lad, he dreamt of steaming in with the red ball and rattling stumps — but the journey wasn’t easy.He eventually made his mark in the Mumbai team, performed well, and shared dressing rooms with some of the giants of Mumbai cricket. But destiny had other plans.Today, at 31, he is in the United States, still chasing and fulfilling his cricketing dreams.Every morning from his flat in California, Shubham enjoys his coffee while gazing at two framed photographs — one of his grandfather and one of his father — before packing his kit bag and heading to practice.Currently, he plays in Major League Cricket (MLC), and on the back of his stellar performances there, he has also earned a contract with Joburg Super Kings in SA20.He credits it all to the blessings of his grandfather, his father, and, of course, the trademark ‘Khadoos’ brand of Mumbai cricket that continues to drive his dreams forward.""I'm the third generation of my family who's playing cricket. My grandfather played Test cricket for India. My father played for India A, the Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup Tournament and the Vijay Hazare Trophy. That’s how I grew up — watching them, going with them for practice sessions, watching them play. I’ve never seen my grandfather play, but I hear a lot of things about him — his attitude, his commitment, his dedication. I saw my father playing first-class games. He’s my inspiration,"" Shubham told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""I got a call from Major League Cricket (MLC). Many of my friends are playing in the US. They just called me and said that there’s an opportunity to play in bigger leagues. So, MLC was going to be introduced in 2023, so I came here in 2022. I wanted to play franchise cricket. When I heard about this, I just made up my mind and wanted to play in this league. There was a Minor League Cricket (MiLC) happening in the USA, and that was a pathway to the Major League. I came here in 2022. The minor league was halfway done, and our team was in a must-win position. I got my first game, and from there my journey started smoothly. In the finals of the minor league, I won the Man of the Match award,"" he said.""I’m very excited. It’s amazing being in the Chennai Super Kings franchise family — Texas Super Kings, and now Johannesburg Super Kings (JSK). Playing alongside Faf du Plessis and others has helped me grow as a player. It’s a great achievement and fun to make a mark,"" he said.Breaking into the Mumbai cricket team, especially the Ranji Trophy side, is never easy. You need to put in the hard yards and be consistently good to earn your place. Right-arm fast bowler Shubham Ranjane, who can also bat, finally made his debut in 2016 under the captaincy of Aditya Tare. Shubham shared the dressing room with Mumbai stars like Shreyas Iyer, Dhawal Kulkarni, Suryakumar Yadav , Abhishek Nayar, and Shardul Thakur.The opposition was Gujarat cricket team, led by Parthiv Patel, and featuring the likes of Axar Patel and Jasprit Bumrah Shreyas Iyer went on to score 194 in the match, while Jasprit Bumrah claimed six wickets — including Shubham’s — in the drawn match at Hubballi.Like every young cricketer, it was a huge moment for debutant Shubham. His heartbeat was racing as he tried to keep his nerves in check. He went on to play 15 first-class matches, scoring 595 runs at an average of 31.31 and picking up 12 wickets, including a five-wicket haul.That same trademark Mumbai ‘Khadoos’ brand of cricket is now helping Shubham take his game to the next level.""It was prestigious to debut for Mumbai against Gujarat. Bumrah and Axar Patel were playing. Chandrakant Pandit was our coach. I was nervous but also proud to be playing alongside big names like Dhawal Kulkarni, Surya, Shardul, Rahane, and Shreyas. I was in the team but not getting top-order opportunities because seniors were already there. I wanted a fair chance to showcase my talent as an all-rounder, so I moved. I’m grateful to Mumbai for everything I learned,"" Shubham said.""Coming from Mumbai taught me hard cricket. Now, in the US, I’m achieving things step by step. Being picked in SA20 is special. My next goal is the IPL and the ICC T20 World Cup 2026. The Mumbai grind gave me confidence to tackle any situation. Playing 10 years in Mumbai with that Khadoos attitude and that brand of cricket helps a lot. People here in the US say I carry that attitude (laughs) — not giving up, handling pressure, and being tough on the field. That’s what defines a Khadoos cricketer,"" Shubham said.""It’s always been great playing with them. It’s all about learning. Mumbai cricket is very tough and competitive. Watching Suryakumar Yadav, Shreyas, and Shardul play — it teaches you body language, attitude, and discipline. It’s always been a pleasure, and it made me feel like I wanted to represent the country too. Yes, I keep talking to them. I really miss playing competitive cricket. I played 10 years of cricket in Mumbai. It was absolute fun and full of hardship, but very rewarding,"" he said.“Bindaas rehne ka. Chill maar. Nervous nahi hone ka” — the words from Suryakumar Yadav, his then Mumbai cricket team teammate, still echo in Shubham’s mind when he recalls making his debut.""Suryakumar Yadav came to me and said — ‘Don’t be nervous, play like you play for your club. Be natural, express yourself.’ That gave me a lot of confidence,"" Shubham recalled.""Surya and I share a very good bond. We are still very good friends. He has supported me a lot. We were roommates during games like the Vijay Hazare Trophy and the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. We never spoke much cricket, just enjoyed moments. He still calls me ‘Dada’. He has always supported and believed in me, especially when I moved to the US,"" Shubham said.","Shubham Ranjane is the third generation of his family to play cricket. His grandfather played Test cricket for India, and his father played for India A. He is currently playing in Major League Cricket in the United States. He has also earned a contract with Joburg Super Kings in SA20.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123979752,imgsize-55820,width-400,resizemode-4/shubman-ranjane-1809-sd.jpg"

Poll Do you think Ashwin's experience will significantly impact Team India's performance in the Hong Kong Sixes? Yes, definitely No, not really

Hong Kong Cricket on Thursday confirmed that Ravichandran Ashwin will be part of Team India at the Hong Kong Sixes 2025, set to be held from November 7 to 9.The veteran off-spinner will add experience and star power to the side in the quick-fire format.

When I believe in something strongly, I run after it. Now I am running after joy in the game,” he remarked while announcing his decision to move on from the IPL.Ashwin, speaking on the opportunity, expressed his enthusiasm to participate in the format. “We have all watched the HK Sixes as youngsters on Television and it has always been an existing format that I wanted to be a part of. This format requires a different strategy and will prove to be high octane which I am looking forward to play alongside my ex-teammates.I am also thrilled to compete against some quality players in the opposition teams, it will be a good challenge for us,” he said.Burji Shroff, Chairperson of Hong Kong Cricket, described Ashwin’s participation as a major boost for the competition. “We are proud to welcome R.

Poll Should the BCCI allow international players to skip certain fielding duties? Definitely No, all players should field equally

NEW DELHI: Former India bowler and 1983 ODI World Cup winner Balvinder Singh Sandhu has put forward an unusual idea to address the workload burden on India’s senior cricketers like Virat Kohli , Rohit Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah.Sandhu argued that the BCCI should consider deploying specialist fielders in domestic cricket and the IPL to help preserve the longevity of these established names, while writing in his Mid-Day column.The veteran pointed to the toll that international schedules take on ageing players, stressing that big names remain the key attraction for fans. “The magnets are the stars — Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah. Without them, this circus is just a cheap mela. Why kill the goose that lays the golden egg?” he wrote.The former cricketer questioned the need of putting big names through excessive fielding drills, noting that audiences mainly come to watch their batting or bowling. “Nobody buys a ticket to see Kohli dive at square leg. They come for a cover drive. Let substitutes do the fielding in domestic cricket, and remember, IPL is domestic cricket.Protect the stars, stretch their careers,” Sandhu suggested.Calling for the introduction of specialist fielders in the T20 format, Sandhu said six or seven such players could be used in domestic competitions, and that international stars could be exempted from intense fielding duties.“T20 here should have specialist fielders. Six or seven of them. Let the stars save their bodies for batting and bowling. Even in domestic cricket, internationals should play without breaking their backs. Youngsters will learn, seniors will last, and the game will gain,” he added.He also criticised the tendency to over-romanticise fielding, warning of the risks involved. “Diving catches look good in replays. They also send men into surgery,” Sandhu wrote.Pointing to the criticism faced by Jasprit Bumrah earlier this year for missing the Oval Test in England, Sandhu said the pacer had not been given the chance to explain his situation.He urged the board to allow players to present their perspective on workload management instead of facing unwarranted backlash.",Former India bowler Balvinder Singh Sandhu has put forward an unusual idea to address the workload burden on India’s senior cricketers.

Who is Sanjog Gupta ?

Poll Do you think the Pakistan Cricket Board's demand to remove Andy Pycroft is justified? Yes, completely justified No, it's unnecessary

The Pakistan Cricket Board’s demand to remove match referee Andy Pycroft from the Asia Cup after the handshake row has headlined all talk surrounding the tournament. It is understood that Sanjog Gupta, ICC CEO, personally fronted the top body's response in negotiations with PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi and COO Salman Naseer.The PCB alleged that Pycroft acted in a “partisan” manner during the high-voltage India–Pakistan group match in Dubai on September 14, claiming he advised captains against routine protocols such as the customary post-match handshake.Pakistan formally requested Richie Richardson to replace Pycroft for their remaining matches. After a series of exchanges, the ICC concluded that Pycroft had not breached any officiating standards.In light of the above-mentioned incidents, Pakistan even threatened a pull-out from the match and also 'stopped' their players from boarding the team bus even though their kits and gear had been boarded. This resulted in a one-hour delay and the game which was scheduled for 8:00PM IST got underway at 9:00PM.Moreover, Pycroft was also seen in his position ahead of the toss for the Pakistan-UAE clash.While the governing body agreed to a limited inquiry into the matter, Gupta stood firm against calls for a temporary replacement, cautioning that such a move without evidence would “set a dangerous precedent and undermine the authority of match officials.”Away from the controversy, Pakistan sealed their progression into the Super 4s with a 41-run win over the UAE in Dubai on Wednesday.

Poll Was Liverpool's late win against Atletico Madrid a show of tactical brilliance? Yes, absolutely! No, it was luck.

Title-holder Paris Saint-Germain roared to victory in the Champions League on Wednesday, while Liverpool once again left it late to continue their stunning start to the season.At the Parc des Princes, PSG dismantled Atalanta 4-0 with style and confidence. Even Bradley Barcola’s missed penalty did little to dent the champions’ dominance, as coach Luis Enrique praised his players: “It’s a joy to see such a performance. I think our fans can be happy.”Nuno Mendes got on the scoresheet in the second half after Khvicha Kvaratskhelia lit up the night with a dazzling solo goal just before halftime. With Ousmane Dembélé sidelined, PSG are already campaigning for him in the upcoming Ballon d’Or awards in Paris, though Mendes and Achraf Hakimi also strengthened their claims.At Anfield, Liverpool survived another nerve-shredding finish in a 3-2 win over Atletico Madrid. Early goals from Andy Robertson and Mohamed Salah had the hosts cruising, but Marcos Llorente — who famously knocked Liverpool out in 2020 — struck twice, in first-half stoppage time and the 81st minute, to level the match. Yet the Reds had one more twist to deliver. In the 92nd minute, Virgil van Dijk rose highest to head in Dominik Szoboszlai’s corner, sealing a dramatic victory.Coach Arne Slot admitted, “We should have made it easier for ourselves.”Elsewhere, Bayern Munich avenged their 2012 final heartbreak by beating Chelsea 3-1 in Munich. Harry Kane scored twice, while Cole Palmer grabbed a fine consolation for the visitors. Inter Milan also enjoyed European nostalgia, defeating Ajax 2-0 in Amsterdam with a Marcus Thuram brace — echoing their revenge for losing the 1972 European Cup final to the Dutch giants.The debutants also made their presence felt. Norway’s Bodo/Glimt staged a late comeback to draw 2-2 at Slavia Prague. Having missed a penalty and trailing 2-0, Kasper Høgh pulled one back before substitute Sondre Brunstad Fet smashed in a stunning equaliser in the 90th minute. Goalkeeper Nikita Haikin then preserved the point with a stoppage-time save.Cypriot side Pafos earned a gritty 0-0 draw at Olympiakos despite being reduced to 10 men after Bruno Felipe’s dismissal in the 26th minute. Veteran defender David Luiz limped off injured on his debut, but the team held firm to mark Cyprus’s first main-phase appearance since 2017.The competition continues Thursday with six more fixtures, including Manchester City hosting Napoli with Kevin De Bruyne set for a return, and Barcelona travelling to Newcastle without the injured Lamine Yamal.","Paris Saint-Germain thrashed Atalanta 4-0 at the Parc des Princes.

Real Madrid opened their Champions League campaign with a narrow 2-1 win over Marseille at the Santiago Bernabeu, despite playing the closing stages with 10 men. Marseille stunned the home crowd when Timothy Weah put them ahead midway through the first half. Real equalised before the interval when Mbappe converted a penalty after Rodrygo was fouled in the box.The home side faced further trouble in the second half. Trent Alexander-Arnold was sidelined with an injury, and Dani Carvajal was sent off following a VAR review for a headbutt on Marseille goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli.Even with ten men, Real Madrid held on thanks to another Mbappe penalty, after Facundo Medina was penalised for handball. Mbappe, who reached 50 goals for the club, said, “For me it’s a penalty, but I understand there are people who don’t. We’re all lost with this rule.”Arsenal followed with a strong 2-0 away win against Athletic Bilbao. Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard, both substitutes, scored late in the game. Martinelli ran through to open the scoring in the 72nd minute, and Trossard sealed the victory with a deflected strike.“We started to grow throughout the game. In the second half, we were more fluent, dominant, and the finishers made the impact for us to win the game,” said coach Mikel Arteta. This was an ideal start for Arsenal, who lost to eventual champions Paris Saint-Germain in last season’s semi-finals.Tottenham Hotspur edged Villarreal 1-0 in North London, with the match decided by a farcical own goal from Villarreal goalkeeper Luiz Junior. Lucas Bergvall’s cross trickled into the net, giving Spurs the win. “It was a very even game that we just edged,” said manager Thomas Frank, as Tottenham continued their strong form under new leadership.Juventus and Borussia Dortmund delivered one of the most thrilling games of the night, finishing 4-4 in Turin. After a goalless first half, Karim Adeyemi put Dortmund ahead, but Kenan Yildiz equalised soon after.

Paris Saint-Germain begin their Champions League title defence against Atalanta on Wednesday, with concerns mounting over their squad's ability to handle an intense schedule following their historic triumph last season. The French champions, who played 65 games in 2024/25, are already facing injury challenges as they prepare for another demanding campaign that includes domestic competitions, European matches, and the FIFA Intercontinental Cup.PSG's European campaign includes matches against Bayern, Tottenham Hotspur, and Newcastle United in the group stage, along with away fixtures at Barcelona, Bayer Leverkusen, Athletic Bilbao, and Sporting Lisbon.The team's previous Champions League performance showed resilience despite early struggles, losing three of eight group stage matches before securing their first European title with a 5-0 victory over Inter Milan in Munich.The demanding schedule from last season has begun taking its toll. Ballon d'Or favorite Ousmane Dembele and Desire Doue are sidelined with muscle injuries from international duty, while Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Lee Kang-in, and Lucas Beraldo suffered injuries in Sunday's 2-0 win against Lens.""It happens to everyone. It is a bit of a difficult time for us because we have a lot of players injured,"" said Luis Enrique, who himself is wearing an arm sling due to a cycling accident. ""I am calm about it and I hope we will manage to overcome it.""The club's squad management last season was effective, with nineteen players logging over 1,000 minutes, matching the rotation patterns of Real Madrid and Barcelona.The Club World Cup's demanding schedule, featuring matches in intense heat and extensive travel across the United States, proved particularly challenging. PSG utilized 19 players compared to Chelsea's 27, ultimately losing 3-0 in the final.This season could see PSG play at least 55 games if they advance in the Champions League, including December's FIFA Intercontinental Cup.Right-back Achraf Hakimi, who recorded the most minutes for PSG last season, faces additional commitments with Morocco's hosting of the Africa Cup of Nations in December and January.The club's transfer activity was minimal, adding only center-back Illia Zabarnyi and goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier, who replaced Gianluigi Donnarumma.""Injuries to high-profile players are only one visible part of the workload crisis facing professional football and are not surprising,"" stated FIFPro, the global players' union. ""The impact is not felt just by the players but increasingly also by clubs, national teams, fans and national competitions.""Despite these challenges, PSG's coach maintains optimism about their European campaign.""It is a special moment. We know how difficult this competition is, but we are relaxed about it and we are hoping to put in a good performance in our first game,"" Luis Enrique said.","Paris Saint-Germain begin their Champions League title defence against Atalanta on Wednesday.

Manchester City cruised to a commanding 3-0 victory over rivals Manchester United on Sunday, with Erling Haaland scoring twice after Phil Foden’s opener at the Etihad Stadium.The result handed Pep Guardiola’s side a timely lift after back-to-back league defeats, while piling more pressure on United manager Ruben Amorim, whose team have now taken just four points from their first four games.City began strongly and made the breakthrough inside 20 minutes. Jeremy Doku’s persistence on the left allowed his cross to find an unmarked Foden to head home.After the restart, Haaland extended the advantage in trademark fashion, racing clear before lifting the ball calmly over Altay Bayindir. Moments later, the Norwegian spurned an open-goal chance when he rounded the goalkeeper but struck the post, keeping United faintly in the contest.Any hopes of a response were dashed by a standout moment from debutant Gianluigi Donnarumma, who clawed away Bryan Mbeumo’s volley at full stretch to preserve City’s two-goal cushion. Minutes later, Harry Maguire’s misplaced pass allowed Bernardo Silva to release Haaland, who finished emphatically to seal the points.The win keeps City six points behind leaders Liverpool but restores momentum ahead of a demanding week featuring fixtures against Napoli and Arsenal. For United, it was another disappointing derby day, with fans audibly expressing their frustration towards Amorim as chants of “sacked in the morning” echoed from the away section.The occasion was preceded by a solemn moment as both sets of supporters paid tribute to boxing great Ricky Hatton, who passed away earlier on Sunday.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins. He was pushed from second place to third, with Cassidy in second. Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

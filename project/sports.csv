Iga Swiatek’s run in the 2025 US Open met with a shocking end on Wednesday as Amanda Anisimova powered past her 6-4, 6-3 in the quarterfinals.It was a rematch of July’s Wimbledon final, where Swiatek had crushed the American 6-0, 6-0. This time, Anisimova dictated play with fearless shot-making to reach her first semifinal in New York.“What I learned then and also throughout this tournament, I feel like with each match that I've played I tell myself to really not go into the match with fear,” the 24-year-old American said. “Today, I came out with not an ounce of fear.”Four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka held off Karolina Muchova 6-4, 7-6 (3) to stay unbeaten in major quarterfinals. Osaka moves into the last four, joining Anisimova in what promises to be an unpredictable finish at Flushing Meadows.On the men’s side, Felix Auger-Aliassime battled past Alex de Minaur in a four-hour, 10-minute marathon, winning 4-6, 7-6 (7), 7-5, 7-6 (4) to advance to his second Grand Slam semifinal and first since 2021 at the US Open.The 25th seed struck 22 aces and 51 winners, saving a crucial set point with a 120 mph ace in the second-set tiebreak to avoid going down two sets to love.“It wasn’t always pretty, but I was willing to dig really deep and do everything I can to stand here right now,” the Canadian said.For the first time in his career, Auger-Aliassime has eliminated three seeds in a single Slam, adding No. 8 de Minaur to earlier wins over No. 3 Alexander Zverev and No. 15 Andrey Rublev. He will next face either top seed Jannik Sinner or No. 10 Lorenzo Musetti for a spot in Sunday’s final.Thursday’s night session brings the women’s semifinals, headlined by defending champion Aryna Sabalenka against Jessica Pegula in a rematch of last year’s title clash.","Amanda Anisimova beats Iga Swiatek 6-4, 6-3 in the quarterfinals.

NEW DELHI: It was nothing short of a night to forget for Irfan Pathan in the 2010 edition of the IPL. Representing Punjab Kings (then Kings XI Punjab), Irfan found himself in the spotlight in match number 54 of the tournament against the Chennai Super Kings in Dharamsala.Punjab, batting first, produced a mammoth total of 192/3, riding on Shaun Marsh’s unbeaten 88 and a quick-fire 44 not out from Irfan himself. With that total on the board, Punjab had every reason to believe they were in the driver’s seat.However, what followed turned out to be one of the most memorable finishes in IPL history, with Irfan at the receiving end.CSK’s chase went down to the wire, and as fate would have it, the equation came down to 16 runs required off the last over. The ball was in Irfan’s hands, and standing at the other end was none other than MS Dhoni Dhoni had other plans in mind.He began the over by dispatching Irfan for a boundary, followed it up with a couple of runs, and then unleashed his brute power to hammer back-to-back sixes.In just a few deliveries, the game had slipped away from Punjab. CSK sealed the contest by six wickets with two balls to spare, and more importantly, secured their place in the semifinals.Dhoni finished unbeaten on 54 off just 29 deliveries, an innings laced with five fours and two sixes, and was rightly adjudged Player of the Match.For the CSK skipper, it was more than just another win.""It's a tough game, you can't always perform, but if you perform in big games, you get that tag of being the pressure player. But the fact is, Raina and Badri set the chase up. It was an emotional moment. Your franchise pays so much money for you, you should at least make the semi-finals,"" Dhoni reflected after the match.Fast forward to today, Irfan once again finds himself in headlines, but for an entirely different reason.An old interview clip linked to Dhoni has resurfaced, where Irfan hinted that Dhoni used to smoke hookah and allegedly favoured players who joined him. The remarks have reignited debates on social media, triggering trolling and fresh discussions around Irfan’s abrupt exit from international cricket. Even when he tries to move past it, fans continue to remind him of the controversy.","MS Dhoni and Irfan Pathan were both involved in one of the most memorable finishes in IPL history.

Poll Should MS Dhoni comment on the recent discussions around his captaincy? Yes, he should share his perspective No, he should stay out of it

Former India captain MS Dhoni was among the star attractions at the US Open 2025, attending the men’s singles quarter-final clash between Novak Djokovic and Taylor Fritz at the Arthur Ashe Stadium.The 44-year-old, who retired from international cricket on August 15, 2020, was spotted in the stands during the high-profile match. A photo of Dhoni posing with businessman Hitesh Sanghvi quickly went viral after Sanghvi shared both a picture and a video of the moment on Instagram.Dhoni remains one of the most celebrated figures in Indian cricket. Across a career spanning 90 Tests, 350 ODIs and 98 T20Is, he guided India to all three ICC white-ball trophies and also took the team to the top of the Test rankings. His presence at the US Open drew attention not only from fans in New York but also back home, where images of his surprise appearance circulated widely on social media.Dhoni has also been at the centre of cricket conversations in recent weeks, after an old interview of Irfan Pathan resurfaced online. The former all-rounder revisited his experiences under Dhoni’s captaincy, particularly his exclusion from the national side. Pathan suggested that communication had been lacking at the time.“Yes, I asked him. During the 2008 Australia series, Mahi bhai's statement came out in the media that Irfan wasn't bowling well. I thought I had bowled well throughout the series, so I went and asked Mahi bhai,” Pathan said in the interview with SportsTak.He added that Dhoni reassured him, saying, “No Irfan, there is nothing like this, everything's going as per plans.”Pathan further remarked, “I don't have a habit of setting up hookah in someone's room or talking about this. Everyone knows. Sometimes if you don't speak about it, it's better. A cricketer's job is to perform on the field and that is what I used to focus on.”Dhoni, however, is yet to opine on the same and has stayed away from the debate, choosing instead to enjoy the tennis spectacle in New York.",Former India captain MS Dhoni was in attendance at the US Open.

SOUTH VS NORTH

Most discussions on the Asia Cup squad that was announced last month centred on one player who didn’t figure in the list of 20 (including five reserves) — Shreyas Iyer The prolific batsman has more experience, expertise and adaptability than many picked for the tournament in Dubai, but he doesn’t figure in the think-tank's T20 scheme of things. Iyer himself has maintained a studious silence.But the spotlight will be firmly on him when he steps onto the field for West Zone against Central Zone in the Duleep Trophy semifinal starting here Thursday.With a limited-overs and Test series against West Indies and South Africa and the ODI and T20 series against Australia looming, the 30-year-old has plenty to play for.Away from Iyer, the West Zone has a star-studded lineup with Yashasvi Jaiswal, who blew hot and cold in England — he had two centuries, an equal number of 50s and several low scores in 10 innings — will look to get some red-ball gametime under his belt.Their skipper Shardul Thakur will look to course correct after mediocre returns in the two Tests he featured in England. Other prominent players include Tanush Kotian, Tushar Deshpande and Ruturaj Gaikwad.Central won’t be easy meat for the batting-dominant West Zone. While West is well-rested, Central were stretched in the second inning by NorthEast Zone in the quarterfinal. Danish Melewar struck a fluent double ton, while Rajat Patidar and Shubam Sharma were other centurions.Patidar, who is leading the side in the absence of Jurel, scored 125 and 66 in the previous outing and will again play a pivotal role for Central.Their main bowlers —Khaleel Ahmed and Deepak Chahar, will look to get among wickets.There has been a spate of injury concerns with Central Zone’s Dhruv Jurel, Vyshak Vijaykumar from South and Sarfaraz Khan from West Zone being among the prominent players who will sit out of the semifinals. They have been replaced by Akshay Wadkar, V Koushik and Shivalik Sharma respectively.In the other last-4 contest, South takes on North Zone with both sides having to chop and change their squad due to injuries and non-availability of players.Unlike in previous years, when there was a strong presence of players from the dominant states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, this edition focuses on players from Kerala. In the absence of Asia Cup-bound Tilak Varma, South are led by Mohammed Azharuddeen, who marshalled Kerala into a historic Ranji Trophy finale appearance last season.South has a smattering of youngsters with some older workhorses in the mix.North, on the other hand, will be without pacers Arshdeep Rana and Harshit Rana, making it an even contest. Having said that, North will have the edge, considering they played the quarterfinals match at the same ground at the new BCCI Centre of Excellence facility.",West Zone take on Central Zone in the Duleep Trophy semifinal in Bengaluru on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Irfan Pathan has once again found himself at the centre of a storm after an old interview clip linked to MS Dhoni resurfaced online, sparking heated debate across social media. In that interview, the former India all-rounder hinted that Dhoni used to smoke hookah and allegedly favoured players who joined him. The claim has triggered widespread trolling and reignited conversations about Pathan’s abrupt exit from international cricket.Even when Pathan tried to stay away from the controversy, fans did not let him off the hook.On Wednesday, he posted a birthday wish for India pacer Mohammed Shami on social media.“Wishing the seam king @MdShami11 a very happy birthday. Looking forward to see your bowling for India again soon. Have a great one,” Pathan wrote.But instead of responding to the birthday greeting, one fan shifted the focus back to the controversy and asked: “Pathan bhai woh hookey ka kya hua???”Rather than ignoring the comment, Pathan chose to respond with humour and tagged Dhoni in his reply. “Mein or @msdhoni sath beth kar pienge ;)” Pathan wrote.Pathan’s career has long been the subject of debate. Despite taking a five-wicket haul in his last ODI, he was left out of the Indian team in 2012 and never returned.The selectors and management never publicly explained his exclusion, but Pathan has hinted on multiple occasions that Dhoni’s captaincy and team dynamics may have played a role.On the field, Pathan’s record speaks for itself. In 29 Tests, he scored 1,105 runs at an average of 31.57, including a century and six fifties, while also claiming 100 wickets at 32.26. His career-best 7/59 remains one of the finest spells by an Indian seamer, fondly remembered by fans.In ODIs, he played 120 matches, scoring 1,544 runs at 23.39 with five fifties. With the ball, he picked up 173 wickets at 29.72, including a best of 5/27.In T20Is, Pathan made key contributions with both bat and ball, taking 28 wickets in 24 matches at a strike rate of 16.5 and scoring 172 runs at a brisk strike rate of 119.44.","Pathan hints that Dhoni used to smoke hookah and allegedly favoured players who joined him.

Irfan Pathan on X (Screengrab)

Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has reacted sharply after an old interview clip linked to MS Dhoni resurfaced online, sparking heated debate on social media.The video, from years ago, featured Pathan reflecting on his communication with Dhoni during his playing days and included remarks that some interpreted as a cryptic reference to the former captain’s off-field preferences.As the clip gained traction, Pathan took to X with a cryptic post, questioning the motives behind its sudden reappearance. “Half decade old video surfacing NOW with a twisted context to the Statement. Fan war? PR lobby?” he wrote, suggesting the resurfacing may have been deliberate. In the interview, Pathan had recalled an incident from the 2008 Australia series when media reports suggested Dhoni was dissatisfied with his bowling.“Yes, I asked him. During the 2008 Australia series, Mahi bhai’s statement came out in the media that Irfan wasn’t bowling well. I thought I had bowled well throughout the series, so I went and asked Mahi bhai. Sometimes statements are twisted in the media, so I also wanted to clarify. Mahi bhai said, ‘No Irfan, there is nothing like this, everything’s going as per plans.’ When you get a reply like this, you believe that okay, you do what you can. Also if you keep asking for explanations again and again after that, you hurt your self-respect,” Pathan said.He followed that account with a pointed remark: “I don’t have a habit of setting up hookah in someone’s room or talking about this. Everyone knows. Sometimes if you don’t speak about it, it’s better. A cricketer’s job is to perform on the field and that is what I used to focus on.”The remarks have ignited a storm of online discussion, with fans divided over whether they were a dig at Dhoni or a broader comment on team culture at the time.By addressing the controversy through his latest post, Pathan has indicated his displeasure at the way the comments have been framed and interpreted, while hinting that the video surfacing again may be part of a deliberate attempt or scheme.","Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has reacted sharply after an old interview clip linked to MS Dhoni resurfaced online.

Poll What aspect of MS Dhoni's leadership do you think is the most inspirational? Calmness under pressure On-field decision-making Backing players

Pakistan women’s cricket team captain Fatima Sana says she is taking inspiraiton from former India skipper MS Dhoni ’s leadership book as she prepares to lead her side into the ODI World Cup later this month.The tournament, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, begins on September 30. Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka, starting their campaign against Bangladesh in Colombo on October 2.Sana admitted that the pressure of captaining at such a stage is natural but said she looks to Dhoni as her role model. “It is natural to be a little nervous initially when captaining in a big tournament like the World Cup, but I take inspiration from Mahendra Singh Dhoni as a captain,” she told PTI.She explained how Dhoni’s approach influences her. “I have seen his matches as India and CSK captain. His on-field decision-making, calmness and the way he backs his players, there is a lot to learn from that. When I got the captaincy, I thought that I have to become like Dhoni. I also watched his interviews and got to learn a lot,” she said.Pakistan have featured in five previous editions of the Women’s ODI World Cup but victories have been difficult to come by.Sana believes the tide will turn. “This time, the jinx will definitely be broken because the young players know how important this tournament is for Pakistan women’s cricket. We will not think about the past. My goal is to take the team to the semifinals,” she said.The all-rounder, who has 397 runs and 45 wickets in 34 ODIs, is counting on her bowlers to deliver. “We have top-class bowlers in the team and spinners will be our trump card. We will depend more on bowling than batting but in the last one year, we have worked a lot on batting and we will get results,” she added.With preparations ongoing in Lahore and a series against South Africa lined up before the tournament, Sana is confident her team will arrive in Sri Lanka firing on all cylinders. “The team is in good rhythm and after the good performance in the qualifiers, everyone’s morale is high,” she said.","Pakistan women's cricket team captain Fatima Sana says she is taking inspiraiton from former India skipper MS Dhoni ’s leadership book.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Robin Uthappa has taken aim at Lalit Modi and Michael Clarke for releasing a video from the 2008 IPL that showed Harbhajan Singh slapping S Sreesanth after a match between Mumbai Indians and Punjab Kings. The clip has reignited discussions around the infamous incident that resulted in Harbhajan receiving an 11-match ban, despite both players having long reconciled and maintained a cordial relationship.The footage, recently put online by Modi and Clarke, has dragged the controversy back into the spotlight.Over the years, Harbhajan and Sreesanth have moved on, often appearing together at commentary stints and promotional events. Harbhajan has repeatedly expressed remorse for his actions, while Sreesanth has spoken warmly about their bond in various interviews.Uthappa, who was on the field when the incident occurred, voiced strong criticism on the Kim-Appa Show with Jarrod Kimber.""That whole Slapgate thing that happened in the IPL. What the f*** man? How does someone get away with stuff like that?"" Uthappa said.""Now, imagine we put up a clip of something that an Australian did that was offensive, that was kept under wraps for the respect of that whole situation, to save the respect of that situation, which is an impulsive, bad decision that a human being made… Now that you have gone and interviewed someone, and you have got access to the file, do you think you have the right to publish it, put that into the world, and make those two people go through that whole emotion, that raw emotion, 20 years later?,"" he said.Uthappa further questioned the lack of sensitivity behind releasing the video and highlighted what he saw as racial double standards in cricket.""Where is your sense of sensitivity and empathy for other people?"" he asked.""We all make mistakes, but are we going to keep putting it out there to make people go through the embarrassment of the wrong choices the person has made? For me, it's guys who aren't brown skinned who get away with it a lot more. Today, we are speaking about Sunny G having an opinion on what other countries speak about Indian cricket. But what about this? Imagine the human implications of this… You can't treat people like crap just because it'll get you more views.

Poll Do you think FIFA is doing enough to combat racism in football? Yes, they are taking strong actions No, they need to do more

FIFA has imposed heavy sanctions on six national football federations, including defending world champion Argentina, following incidents of racist abuse during World Cup qualifiers in June.The governing body’s disciplinary committee listed Albania, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina among those punished for “discrimination and racist abuse.”While details of the incidents were not disclosed, the fines highlight FIFA’s focus on tackling racism in football.Albania received the heaviest sanction, a fine of over ₹1.75 crore ($200,000).

Poll Do you believe the sentence given to the Espanyol supporter is sufficient to deter future incidents of racism in football? Yes, it sets a strong precedent. No, harsher penalties are needed.

A Barcelona court has sentenced an Espanyol supporter to one year in prison for racially abusing Athletic Bilbao striker Inaki Williams during a league match in January 2020.The individual was found guilty of directing racist chants and gestures at the Ghana international inside the RCDE Stadium. While the ruling imposes a custodial sentence, Spanish law allows the fan to avoid serving time because it is under two years and there are no prior convictions.In addition, the court imposed a fine of around 1,000 euros (over ₹1 lakh) and issued a three-year ban from entering football stadiums. The High Court of Justice of Catalonia confirmed the sanctions in a statement.The Spanish Prosecutor’s Office had initially sought a two-year sentence but later reached an agreement with the accused.La Liga welcomed the decision, stressing its wider significance. “Today’s ruling represents another milestone in the fight against racism in football and the eradication of all forms of violence inside and outside stadiums,” the league said, as quoted by AFP.The incident forms part of a recurring pattern in Spanish football, where high-profile players have frequently been subjected to abuse. Earlier this year, another Espanyol–Athletic clash at the same venue was halted following allegations that visiting forward Maroan Sannadi faced racist taunts from home fans.Several other cases have also reached the courts. In June 2024, three Valencia supporters were sentenced to eight months in prison for abusing Real Madrid’s Vinicius Junior. That same month, four Atletico Madrid ultras received suspended jail terms after hanging a dummy of the Brazilian from a bridge in what authorities classified as a hate crime.Alongside Vinicius, both Inaki and his brother Nico Williams have emerged as central figures in the campaign against racism in Spanish football.","A Barcelona court has sentenced an Espanyol supporter to one year in prison for racially abusing Athletic Bilbao striker Inaki Williams during a league match in January 2020.

Portugal’s first international camp since the tragic death of Diogo Jota was marked by a deeply emotional gesture from his close friend and teammate Ruben Neves. The 28-year-old midfielder unveiled a striking tattoo on the back of his left leg, depicting him embracing Jota, a moving homage to the Liverpool forward who lost his life in a car crash in Spain on July 3.The tattoo, which shows Neves holding Jota in his iconic “Diogo J 21” shirt, is inscribed with the words: “You will never be forgotten. We are 23+1.” It has since gone viral, becoming a symbol of the Portuguese team’s grief and unity.“More than friendship, we are family,” Neves said in a video shared by the Portuguese Football Federation . “When we’re at the table, in the locker room, or on the plane, you will still be with us.”Neves, who played alongside Jota at Porto, Wolves, and for Portugal, helped carry his coffin at the funeral and will now wear the No.21 jersey in his memory. Manager Roberto Martínez explained: “The No.21 jersey will go to Rúben Neves because, that way, that number will remain on the field and with all of us. He had a very close relationship with Diogo and is the ideal person to represent him.”Earlier, the national team joined Jota’s family, widow Rute Cardoso, agent Jorge Mendes, and Portuguese leaders President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa and Prime Minister Luís Montenegro in an official ceremony. A bronze framed Portugal shirt bearing Jota’s No.21 was unveiled at the training base in Lisbon. Cristiano Ronaldo and teammates, dressed in suits, stood in solemn tribute as Neves delivered a handwritten letter to his late friend: “Life brought us together and nothing can break that bond… From today on, you’ll step on to the pitch with us.”","Portugal's first international camp since the tragic death of Diogo Jota was marked by a deeply emotional gesture from his close friend and teammate Ruben Neves.

With the next World Cup just nine months away, European champions Spain and other heavyweights are finally kicking off their qualifying campaigns this week. France, Germany and Portugal are also starting their journeys, aiming for a place in the tournament to be held in North America.Elsewhere, the picture looks very different. World Cup holders Argentina, along with Brazil and Ecuador, have already sealed their spots from South America. In Asia, six teams have booked their tickets. Europe has 16 slots available, with 12 going directly to group winners and four more to be decided through play-offs.Spain, ranked second in the world behind Argentina, begin their campaign away to Bulgaria before facing a tough test in Turkey. Led by youngsters Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams, and boosted by the return of Rodri from injury, they are considered one of the favourites. But coach Luis de la Fuente has urged caution, pointing out that even giants like Italy have missed World Cups in the past.France are eyeing one last big run under Didier Deschamps, who is expected to step down after 14 years in charge. Les Bleus are strong favourites in a group featuring Ukraine, Iceland and Azerbaijan.Deschamps has called up Liverpool forward Hugo Ekitike for the first time and reminded fans that qualifying is never straightforward.Portugal begin life after the tragic loss of Diogo Jota , with Roberto Martinez promising to honour his memory. Cristiano Ronaldo, now 40, looks determined to lead his country in pursuit of a maiden World Cup.Germany, led by Julian Nagelsmann, are hoping to end a poor run at major tournaments. They start against Slovakia and Northern Ireland, with new stars Florian Wirtz and Nick Woltemade offering hope.Italy remain in trouble after a disastrous 3-0 defeat to Norway in June. Gennaro Gattuso has now taken over as coach and faces Estonia and Israel with no room for slip-ups. England, meanwhile, have made a steady start under Thomas Tuchel and look comfortable in their group, while Denmark, Belgium, Switzerland and Sweden are also expected to challenge strongly in their pools.The road to the first 48-team World Cup has begun, and in Europe, every slip could prove costly.","The road to the first 48-team World Cup has begun, and in Europe, every slip could prove costly.

Poll How do you feel about the AIFF's ability to handle the upcoming football season? Very confident Not confident They cannot

: The uncertainty surrounding Indian football is expected to end with the Supreme Court directing the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to take necessary measures for start of the season and issue tenders inviting bids for new commercial partners.In April this year, Supreme Court had directed the AIFF “not to enter into any binding contracts till the judgment (on the draft constitution) is pronounced.”The direction brought football to a standstill since the AIFF’s 15-year contract with FSDL, its marketing partners, was to end in December this year. The next edition of the top-tier Indian Super League (ISL) was then kept on hold, prompting three clubs to suspend player salaries. Six others have not yet started pre-season training.On the directions of the Supreme Court, AIFF and FSDL then came up with a consensual resolution which the court felt was “compelling and necessary” to break the impasse.“We direct AIFF to take such measures as may be necessary for timely commencement of football calendar and to maintain competitive continuity for the 2025-2026 season with respect to Super Cup and other competitions under its control,” the Supreme Court said in an order on Tuesday.The apex court also asked AIFF to “issue tenders inviting bids for open, competitive and transparent process for selection of its commercial partner to conduct Indian Super League.”The order issued on Tuesday does not prohibit AIFF from seeking long-term commercial partners, neither does it make a mention of fresh elections, despite arguments from senior lawyers that the “present committee was elected for three months but now it’s been three years.”Former Justice (Retd.) L. Nageswara Rao has been appointed to ensure that the selection process “enures in identifying a competent, reputed and an efficient firm as a commercial partner to conduct ISL, in line with global best practices.”“The Supreme Court order comes as a huge relief for Indian football and we can now begin work on commencing the season,” AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey told TOI on Tuesday. ""For some months now, player salaries were on hold and there was uncertainty too with clubs hesitant to even start pre-season. Now the road is clear. AIFF will ensure that players get enough competitive matches, starting with the Super Cup.”Meanwhile, AIFF is anxiously waiting for the final order on the all-important constitution, a case which is pending in the apex court since 2017, when the court directed formulation of a new constitution.FIFA has given AIFF a deadline of October 30 to secure a definitive order from the Supreme Court approving the revised AIFF constitution and then get it ratified by the general body. Failure to adhere to its obligation, “may result in sanctions outlined in the FIFA and AFC Statutes, including the possibility of suspension.”","Supreme Court orders All India Football Federation (AIFF) to take necessary measures for start of the season and issue tenders inviting bids for new commercial partners.

Poll Should the EFL consider expelling Grimsby Town for fielding an ineligible player? Yes, they should No, it isn't that serious

Grimsby Town have been fined £20,000 (₹ 23,54,698) by the English Football League (EFL) after fielding an ineligible player during their Carabao Cup victory over Manchester United The League Two side stunned United in the second round, winning on penalties after a 2-2 draw in normal time. But their success was overshadowed when it emerged that midfielder Clarke Oduor, who had joined on loan from Bradford City, had been registered one minute and 59 seconds after the competition’s noon deadline.Grimsby admitted the error and self-reported the breach. The EFL confirmed: “The club’s non-compliance was not deliberate with no intention to deceive or mislead.” The Mariners must pay £10,000 immediately, with a further £10,000 suspended until the end of the season.In a statement, Grimsby explained: “The registration was submitted to the EFL at one minute past the deadline and the issue was not immediately identified by the club due to a computer problem being experienced. We accept the fine imposed and fully recognise the importance of adhering to competition rules.”The club added that they had reviewed internal processes: “This mistake was not deliberate, and the club acted transparently by self-reporting the breach as soon as it came to light.Since this incident, we have undertaken a thorough review of our processes and implemented strengthened measures to ensure it cannot happen again. We thank the EFL board for recognising our co-operation and intent.”Manchester United declined to comment on the matter but, under EFL rules, they have until next Monday to appeal the decision. The EFL stressed the fine “followed precedent” after reviewing the case and comparing it with similar offences.On three previous occasions, clubs have been punished but allowed to progress after fielding ineligible players in the League Cup. Liverpool, Accrington Stanley and Sunderland were all fined but not expelled, with each of them having also won their respective ties.David Artell’s Grimsby side will now meet Sheffield Wednesday, who are struggling in the Championship, in the third round later this month.","Grimsby Town have been fined £20,000 by the English Football League (EFL) The League Two side fielded an ineligible player during their Carabao Cup victory over Manchester United.

The 2025 summer transfer window has closed and it’s been a big one. The English Premier League broke its £2.36 billion single-window record from 2023, with Liverpool alone responsible for around £450 million of that, including splashing roughly £130 million on British-record signing Alexander Isak from Newcastle United.Isak’s deal was confirmed on transfer deadline day, while £55 million Brentford striker Yoane Wissa replaced him at Newcastle. But Crystal Palace defender Marc Guéhi did not get his £35 million move to Anfield as it collapsed in the final hours because Palace couldn’t find a replacement.Elsewhere, Manchester United sold Rasmus Højlund to Napoli and Anthony to Real Betis, while bringing in Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens for around £18 million.Chelsea offloaded striker Nicolas Jackson to Bayern Munich and banked a £15 million loan fee, with an option to make it permanent for £56 million next summer. They also signed Facundo Buonanotte on loan from Brighton and sent young winger Tyrique George to Fulham for £22 million, making them the first club to bank over £300 million in player exits in a single window.Tottenham completed a loan deal for PSG striker Randal Kolo Muani, and London rivals Arsenal landed Bayer Leverkusen defender Piero Hincapie on loan, with an option to sign him next year for around £45 million.Manchester City’s £25 million deal for PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma saw Ederson exit for Galatasaray and Inter Milan move for City defender Manuel Akanji on loan, while City midfielder Issa Kabore joined Wrexham on loan.Liverpool saved the biggest transfer until last in its remarkable $570 million summer spree, finally signing Alexander Isak from Newcastle for a British-record fee.The biggest saga of Europe's summer transfer window ended with Isak completing his dream move to the English champion for 125 million pounds ($170 million).One transfer Liverpool failed to get over the line, however, was for England defender Marc Guehi, who will stay at Crystal Palace for the final year of his contract because the London team couldn't secure a replacement.Manchester City have confirmed the signing of Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris Saint-Germain on a five-year contract until 2030, following Ederson's departure. The 26-year-old goalkeeper, standing at 6ft 5ins, brings extensive experience from his time at AC Milan and PSG, where he achieved multiple domestic titles and a UEFA Champions League trophy.Donnarumma spent four seasons in France, helping PSG secure four Ligue One titles, two Coupe de France victories, three Trophee des Champions titles, and their first UEFA Champions League trophy last season.""To have signed for Manchester City is such a special and proud moment for me. I am joining a squad packed with world-class talent and a team led by the one of the greatest managers in the history of football in Pep Guardiola. This is a club every player in world football would love to join,"" Donnarumma said.Manuel Akanji has joined Italian club Inter Milan on a season-long loan deal from Manchester City.The Swiss international moved to City from Borussia Dortmund in September 2022 and has made 136 appearances for the Blues.He won seven trophies during his time at the Etihad Stadium playing a major part in their historic treble during his debut season and the following campaign when they became the first English men’s team to win four league titles in a row.In total, Akanji has lifted two Premier League titles, one UEFA Champions League, one FIFA Club World Cup, one FA Cup, one Community Shield and one UEFA Super Cup during a memorable campaign in Manchester.Former Arsenal and Barcelona star Alexis Sanchez has joined Sevilla from Udinese, the Spanish club said.The announcement came just hours after Udinese said he was leaving the Serie A club by mutual consent.The Chilean, who also represented Manchester United, Inter Milan and Marseille in his career, had returned to Udinese for a second spell a year ago.It will be the 26-year-old's fifth club in two years having moved from Roma to the Turkish side in 2023 before being loaned out to Aston Villa, Atalanta and then Fiorentina.He went on to win La Liga with Barca in 2013, Serie A with Inter Milan in 2021 and 2024, and the FA Cup with Arsenal in 2015 and 2017.Jamie Vardy, the veteran English forward whose goals fired Leicester City to an unlikely Premier League title truimph in 2016, joined newly promoted Serie A side Cremonese.Vardy, 38, a free agent since leaving Leicester in May, put pen to paper on a one-year contract with an option to extend just hours before the transfer window closed.Newcastle signed DR Congo forward Yoane Wissa from Brentford in a £50 million ($67 million) deal after Alexander Isak left St James' Park.Wissa agreed a long-term contract with the Magpies and will wear Newcastle's famous number nine shirt.The 28-year-old's eventual fee could rise to £55 million depending on add-on clauses.Manchester United on Monday completed the deadline-day signing of Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens, also moving on big-money flops Rasmus Hojlund, Antony and Jadon Sancho.Amorim was also keen to boost his goalkeeping options after poor starts to the season for Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.A variety of options were reportedly considered, including Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez, before a deal was done for Lammens for 21 million euros ($24.6 million) plus add-ons.Hojlund has joined Napoli on loan while Sancho has signed for Villa until the end of the season. Real Betis announced the signing of Brazil international winger Antony on a five-year deal.Bayern Munich on Monday announced the signing of striker Nicolas Jackson on a season-long loan from Chelsea, days after it appeared that the Premier League club had cancelled the move.The announcement, coming hours after the transfer window closed, ended days of uncertainty for the 24-year-old Senegal striker.After Jackson arrived in Munich on Saturday, Chelsea decided to cancel the loan deal and recall the player, saying that an injury to forward Liam Delap had forced their hand.Bayern said they would honour Chelsea's request but Jackson refused to return to London, with his agent making several public statements hoping that the move would still go ahead.On Monday, Bayern reportedly agreed to a loan fee of 16.5 million euros ($19 million), 1.5 million higher than the previous arrangement.The loan fee paid by Bayern is the highest in the club's history, eclipsing the 13 million euros paid in 2017 to Real Madrid for James Rodriguez.Jadon Sancho joined Aston Villa on a season-long loan from Manchester United. The 25-year-old has joined Unai Emery's side after spending last season on loan at Chelsea, where he helped the club win the UEFA Conference League.Sancho's move to Villa means he follows in the footsteps of his former Manchester United teammate Marcus Rashford who also made a temporary switch to Birmingham during the second half of the last campaign. Rashford is now at Barcelona.Arsenal signed Ecuador defender Piero Hincapie on a season-long loan from Bayer Leverkusen. Hincapie can make a permanent move to Arsenal for £45 million ($60 million) at the end of the current campaign.The 23-year-old made more than 100 appearances for Leverkusen after joining the German club in 2021 and played a key role in their Bundesliga title victory in 2023-24.Paris Saint-Germain playmaker Marco Asensio has joined Turkish side Fenerbahce. ""Our club has reached an agreement with Paris Saint-Germain for the permanent transfer of Spanish midfielder Marco Asensio,"" Fenerbahce posted on social media, without disclosing the fee paid for the Spaniard.Asensio spent the second half of last season on loan at Premier League side Aston Villa, notching eight goals in 21 appearances in all competitions.","The 2025 summer transfer window has closed and it’s been a big one.

Poll How many trophies do you think Donnarumma will help Manchester City win by 2030? 1-3 trophies 4-6 trophies 7 or more trophies

Manchester City have completed the signing of Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris Saint-Germain, the club confirmed on Tuesday, just hours after announcing Ederson’s departure.The 26-year-old has signed a contract until the summer of 2030, with the move subject to international clearance. Standing at 6ft 5in, Donnarumma arrives at the Etihad with considerable experience at the highest level across Serie A, Ligue 1 and European competitions.He replaces Ederson, who leaves the club as the goalkeeper with the most assists in Premier League history. The Italian, while being a master in the art of shot stopping, is not at the level of Ederson when it comes to using his feet. This transition points to Pep Guardiola's plan to rely more on a traditional keeper rather that the ball-playing keeper and build-from-the-back system seen for the past several years at the club.Donnarumma rose through AC Milan’s academy and made his senior debut at just 16, eventually recording 250 appearances for the club and helping them to the 2016 Italian Supercoppa. In 2021, he joined PSG, where he spent four seasons and was central to their domestic dominance. He lifted four Ligue 1 titles, two Coupe de France trophies, three Trophee des Champions crowns, and most recently, the club’s first UEFA Champions League trophy.Internationally, Donnarumma was Italy’s standout performer at Euro 2020, starring in the penalty shootout victory against England at Wembley. His performances earned him the Player of the Tournament award.Speaking on his move, Donnarumma said, ""To have signed for Manchester City is such a special and proud moment for me. I am joining a squad packed with world-class talent and a team led by the one of the greatest managers in the history of football in Pep Guardiola. This is a club every player in world football would love to join.""He added, ""I have admired watching Manchester City for many years - so to now be able to play for the club is a huge honour and a privilege. I cannot wait to meet my new teammates, the staff and the fans. Playing at the Etihad Stadium will be very, very special for me. I am very excited for what lies ahead and can promise that I will give absolutely everything to try and help the club achieve even more success.""City’s Director of Football Hugo Viana described the arrival as a major boost. ""Gianluigi's pedigree, quality and record speaks for itself, and we are all absolutely thrilled he has joined us here at City,"" Viana said. ""There is no doubt Gianluigi will bring further quality and depth to our top-class goalkeeping department.""","Gianluigi Donnarumma joins Manchester City from Paris Saint-Germain.

European football clubs outside the Premier League completed major transfer deals as the summer transfer window closed on Monday, with significant moves across Italy, Spain, Germany, France, and other leagues. Several high-profile players switched clubs through free transfers, substantial fees, and loan arrangements, reshaping team rosters across the continent.In Italy, Serie A clubs made notable acquisitions with Kevin De Bruyne joining Napoli and Luka Modric moving to AC Milan, both as free agents. AC Milan further strengthened their squad by signing Christopher Nkunku from Chelsea for 37 million euros and Ardon Jashari from Club Brugge for 36 million euros.Inter Milan secured multiple signings, including Luis Henrique from Marseille and Ange-Yoan Bonny from Parma for 23 million euros each. Roma added firepower to their attack with loan deals for Evan Ferguson from Brighton and Leon Bailey from Aston Villa.Spanish clubs made substantial investments, with Real Madrid leading the way by signing Dean Huijsen from Bournemouth for 63 million euros.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

Maaya shows her fight

Poll Should tennis players focus more on doubles matches? Yes, it's equally important No, singles is the priority

: Yuki Bhambri lifted the mood for India on a cloudy evening at the Queens borough.Bhambri and New Zealand’s Michael Venus, the 14seeds in the US Open men’s doubles draw, played their sharpest tennis in a while to upset the number four seeds Germans Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz.The Indo-Kiwi combine came through 6-4, 6-4 in one-hour 23-minutes to move into the quarterfinals at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre on Tuesday.This is the 33-year-old Indian’s first major quarterfinals.In a long-drawn ninth game that went to five deuces the Indo-Kiwi combine had multiple chances to break and finally took it on the fourth opportunity before closing out the set on their third set point much to the delight of Indian fans who had crowded Court No.11.In the second set the 14seeds fell back 2-4 after being broken in the sixth game.There on they won four successive games with Bhambri setting up the break back with a two-hander down-the-line. He followed it up with another backhand return, this time going crosscourt and Krawietz could only stuff a backhand volley into the net on the second breakpoint.Venus, the senior partner in age 37 and ranking 25, and Bhambri, broke again before the Indian served out the match.“It was a pretty good match from us today, one of the better matches we have played, it was almost clean,” said Bhambri of their effort on court, where they had just eight unforced errors. “To come back and beat the Germans who I have lost twice to at Wimbledon last year and at Munich this year was extra special.”“A match-up like this is always tough and tricky, we were really composed today. We kept fighting for points even when we were sometimes down in the game and gave ourselves chances to do good and eventually here I am in the quarterfinals of the US Open.”“Hopefully we can keep going and keep getting better as a team,” Bhambri finished.Next up for Bhambri and Venus are the 11seeds Nikola Mektic of Croatia and American Rajeev Ram in the quarterfinals on Wednesday.Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi gave the Louis Armstrong stadium a glimpse of the size of her fight.The 16-year-old, whose match against the No.2 seed in the junior girls draw Briton Hannah Klugman, was played on the second biggest show court in this sprawling arena, was unphased as she went toe-to-toe with Klugman for the two-hours they were on court.Maaya, playing her first junior Grand Slam main draw, went down 7-6 (1), 4-6, 3-6 in just over two-hours.It was a quality match from both players – where a combined count of 47 winners were clocked (Klugman had 26) and 68 unforced errors (38 from the Brit). The difference between the two showed in the breakpoints the No.2 seed saved six of 12, while the Indian managed one of nine.Maaya was told by her coach the previous night that she was scheduled to play second on Armstrong. The teenager’s reaction was, no way! The Indian got to hit on the match court for an hour before the start of play.Maaya, who swept to 3-0 lead in the first set, said there were nerves despite what the scoreboard said.“As the more the match progressed, I was able to put my head down and do what I had to do,” she said. “It was an amazing experience and I was happy that there were so many people watching us.”Maaya thought her best chance to close the match was in the second set. “I was up by a set and leading 4-3 in the second,” she said. “Maybe if I could have done better on that one game at 4-3 I would have had a chance, but kudos to Hannah. She’s very experienced at this level and she played very well.”Maaya was back on court a couple of hours later for the girls doubles first round where she partnered Argentina’s Luna Maria Cinalli. The Indo-Argentine pair went down 2-6, 2-6 to the fourth seeds Belgian Jeline Vandromme and Lithuania’s Laima Vladson.In the junior boys doubles, Kriish Tyagi and Taipei’s Chen Kuan-Shou lost to the seventh-seeded American pairing of Noah Johnston and Benjamin Willwerth 6-4, 6-7 (4), 13-11 after saving eight match points in the super tie-break.Johnston and Willwerth led 9-4 but the Indo-Taipei combine levelled at 9-9 and continued to push, but couldn’t quite swing it their way.India’s Hitesh Chauhan and Spain’s Tito Chavez were ousted by fourth seeds Russia’s Timofei Derepasko and Alexander Vasilev of Bulgaria 1-6, 4-6.","Yuki Bhambri and Michael Venus beat number four seeds Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz.

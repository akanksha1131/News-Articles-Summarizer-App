IPL 2025: RCB vs CSK preview | CSK, RR out, SRH on the brink

'VIRAT'S SUPPORT IS HUGE FOR YASH'

Poll Do you think Yash Dayal's performance has improved since joining RCB? No, it has worsened No, it has remained the same Yes, slightly Yes, significantly

NEW DELHI: It must have been déjà vu for Yash Dayal when he was handed the final over by skipper Rajat Patidar on Saturday. It was the same scenario he faced in IPL 2024: same team ( RCB ), same opponent ( CSK ), same venue (M. Chinnaswamy Stadium ), and the same batter on strike ( MS Dhoni ).In 2024, Dayal had to defend 17 runs; this time, it was 15. Back then, despite being hit for a massive six off the first ball by Dhoni, Dayal held his nerve, pulling things back and leading RCB to a thrilling win that secured their playoff spot while sending CSK packing.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! On Sunday, Dayal once again found himself entrusted with the crucial task by his captain, with the legendary Dhoni on strike. The atmosphere in the stadium was tense, but Dayal remained ice-cold.The final over was a spectacle of nerves and drama. CSK needed 15 runs to salvage some pride in what had been a dreadful campaign. Dayal gave away a single to Dhoni on the first ball and another single to Jadeja on the second. Then came the turning point: on the third ball, Dayal dismissed Dhoni and shifted the momentum in RCB’s favour.Shivam Dube entered with CSK needing 13 from 3 balls.Then, chaos. A waist-high no-ball gave Dube a free hit, which he smashed for six. The equation suddenly changed — 6 needed off 3 balls.With just six required from three, Dayal kept his composure. He bowled a single to Dube on the fourth ball, and Jadeja couldn’t make an impact on the penultimate ball, also taking a single.Now, it was down to 4 runs needed from the final ball. Dayal exchanged a brief word with Patidar. The tension was palpable, but Dayal calmly took his run-up and delivered a low full-toss. Dube connected hard, sending the ball to long-on, but only managed two runs.RCB dugout, players on the field and thousands in the stands erupted. Not only did the win lift them to the top of the points table, but it also marked another clutch finish from Dayal — his calmness under pressure proving decisive once more.A unique stat: In both the 2024 and 2025 instances, Dayal dismissed Dhoni.Despite the no ball and the six, another person who remained cool under pressure was his father, Chanderpal Dayal, watching from Allahabad. At no point did he doubt the outcome, knowing full that Yash would pull through.""It’s never over till the last ball is bowled in cricket. Yash is more mature now. I’m sure even the fans had given up — my family did too. But I was confident that Yash would pull it off. And he did. His calmness was the key in this match,"" Yash Dayal's father told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""I was watching the 2024 match — he was in the same situation, and Dhoni was there too. When Patidar handed him the last over this time, I was literally smiling. The skipper knows Yash well. The management has shown a lot of trust in him. Virat has supported him immensely since he joined RCB. He’s the reason Yash is performing so freely, without any baggage on his shoulders""Virat hamesha bolte hain usko darr ke nahi, bindas khel, khul ke khel [Virat always tells him to not play with fear, but to play freely and with confidence],"" the father said.Dayal has burried the 2023 nightmare a long back. While playing for Gujarat Titans, Dayal had to defend 29 off the final over against Kolkata Knight Riders. KKR's hard-hitting batter Rinku Singh hit five consecutive sixes off Yash Dayal to give his team a dramatic victory.Dayal became the butt of jokes on social media. He was released by Gujarat Titans ahead of IPL 2024 Auction. But, RCB showed faith in him and bought him for Rs 5 crore. He was also retained by RCB prior to the 2025 season.“I would like to thank RCB for showing faith in me and for retaining me. I couldn’t have asked for a better team to play for. RCB believed in me even in my lowest moments. That is very special for me,” said Dayal on social media ahead of the season.Dayal's father Chandrapal revealed how Kohli helped Dayal in tough times.""He always said 'Papa bhul jao uss episode ko, mai yaad nahi karna chahta. Bahot aage jana hai [Papa, forget that episode. I don't want to remember it. Have to go a long way]'. He was never down, even after getting hit by Rinku Singh. I am really thankful to RCB for showing trust in him and supporting him,"" the father said. Virat Kohli has supported him a lot. When Yash joined RCB, Virat would often call him to his room — and sometimes, he would go to Yash’s room himself. They discussed that over [from 2024], and Virat told him one thing: ‘Keep working hard, toofan macha de. Main hoon tere saath. Chinta mat karna. Mehnat karna mat chhodna. Galtiyan karna, par seekhna aur aage badhna.’ (Keep working hard, create a storm. I’m with you. Don’t worry. Never stop putting in the effort. Make mistakes, but learn and move forward). Virat has given him a lot of freedom and turned him into a fearless cricketer,"" the father said.""Maine kaafi cricketers ko tootate hue dekhe hai, espcially bowlers ko par Virat ne apne haath se joda hai [I have seen many cricketers break down, especially bowlers, but Virat has connected them with his own hands],"" Chandrapal signed off.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru's Yash Dayal was handed the final over by Rajat Patidar on Saturday.

Astrologer Greenstone Lobo: Is Yuzvendra Chahal's India career over?

NEW DELHI: The fans at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium were on the edge of their seats as Royal Challengers Bengaluru edged out Chennai Super Kings in a nail-biting thriller that went down to the final ball. From the outset, the contest promised nerves and fireworks — and it delivered on all counts.Half-centuries from Virat Kohli and Jacob Bethell, followed by Romario Shepherd’s explosive finishing touch, powered RCB to a formidable total. In response, 17-year-old Ayush Mhatre stole the spotlight for CSK, forging a crucial partnership with Ravindra Jadeja to take their side within touching distance of a stunning win. But in the end, CSK fell just two runs short.The final over, bowled by Yash Dayal , was a theatre of nerves and drama. With CSK needing 15 off 6 and Dhoni and Jadeja at the crease, the pressure was immense. Dayal conceded single off the first two deliveries . On the third delivery, he removed the legendary Dhoni, swinging the match back in RCB’s favour.Then came chaos — a waist-high no-ball that gave Dube a free hit and the left hander whacked the pacer for a maximum. With six needed off three, Dube managed just a single. Jadeja took another single to bring the equation to four off just one ball.Four were needed off the final ball, Dayal bowled a low full-toss, Dube struck it to long-on, but RCB’s fielding held strong. Only two runs were scored.Dayal’s calm under pressure sealed a memorable win for RCB, lifting them to the top of the points table amid wild celebrations.Chasing a daunting 214, CSK were powered by a brilliant 114-run partnership between 17-year-old Ayush Mhatre and veteran Ravindra Jadeja. Mhatre, playing with maturity beyond his years, smashed 94 off 48 balls with nine fours and five sixes, while Jadeja remained unbeaten on 77 off 45 (8x4s, 2x6s).However, their valiant effort couldn’t carry CSK over the line, as they finished on 211/5 in 20 overs.RCB’s Lungi Ngidi turned the tide with key wickets, returning with impressive figures of 3/30, including the crucial breakthroughs of Mhatre and Sam Curran.Earlier, RCB posted 213/5 after being put in to bat. Jacob Bethell (55 off 33) and Virat Kohli (62 off 33) gave the hosts a flying start, adding 97 runs for the first wicket. But it was Romario Shepherd who provided the real fireworks at the death. Coming in late, the West Indian bludgeoned 53* off just 14 balls — the fastest fifty of the season and joint second-fastest in IPL history — hammering four fours and six sixes in a stunning display.For CSK, Matheesha Pathirana bowled with fire and accuracy, picking up 3/36 in his four overs.With this thrilling win, RCB not only bagged two crucial points but also moved to the top of the points table.

Astrologer Greenstone Lobo: Is Yuzvendra Chahal's India career over?

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings' young star Dewald Brevis found himself at the centre of a major controversy during their IPL 2025 clash against Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.In a high-stakes chase, Brevis was dismissed for a golden duck on his very first ball after being adjudged LBW to Lungi Ngidi.While the delivery looked to be sliding down leg, Brevis hesitated to take a review and was eventually denied the chance — the 15-second DRS timer had expired.The South African batter, caught in a moment of doubt, discussed the decision with non-striker Ravindra Jadeja before finally signalling for DRS.But it was too late. Replays later confirmed that the ball would have missed the stumps comfortably, sparking widespread criticism of both the on-field umpire’s decision and the rigidity of the DRS timing system.Visibly frustrated, Brevis and Jadeja briefly argued with the umpire, but the decision stood.Watch:Many fans and experts felt the youngster was hard done by, with some questioning whether players should be given more flexibility to review controversial calls, especially in such a crucial game.The missed review came back to haunt CSK, who eventually fell short by just two runs while chasing RCB’s formidable 213/5.Despite heroic efforts from 17-year-old Ayush Mhatre (94 off 48) and Jadeja (77 not out off 45), the Super Kings ended at 211/5. Brevis’s early exit proved pivotal, as one more boundary could have swung the match CSK’s way.The game had it all — blistering fifties from Virat Kohli, Jacob Bethell, and Romario Shepherd for RCB, and a stunning near-chase by CSK.But it was the DRS drama involving Brevis that will remain the most talked-about moment from a thriller that pushed RCB to the top of the points table.","Chennai Super Kings' Dewald Brevis was dismissed for a golden duck on his very first ball.

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka secured her third Madrid Open title by defeating Coco Gauff 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) on Saturday in Madrid. The victory marked her tour-leading 31st win this season, adding to her previous titles in Brisbane and Miami, while also matching Petra Kvitova's record of three women's Madrid Open titles .Sabalenka dominated the first set after Gauff's initial hold, winning 17 consecutive points and establishing a 4-1 lead with breaks in the third and fifth games.The 26-year-old Belarusian secured the first set in 35 minutes when Gauff sliced wide on the second set point.""Getting to six finals sounds crazy, to be honest... I work hard and I know that if I bring my game and if I fight for every point that I'm capable of that. But to actually like do it for real, I was like, okay, this is cool. This is ... like a dream. I really hope that I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing and keep playing the way I'm playing right now.""21-year-old Gauff, the 2023 US Open champion, showed more resistance in the second set, breaking in the third game and consolidating for a 3-1 advantage.At 5-4, serving for the set, Gauff faced difficulty with double faults and saved three break points before Sabalenka eventually claimed the break.A notable moment occurred when Sabalenka dropped her racquet during a rally, looking at the crowd in bemusement.The match concluded in a tie-break where Sabalenka secured multiple championship points before Gauff's double fault handed her the victory.""You know, like now probably Iga is not doing well, which is absolutely fine, and I know that she's going to come back. I'm just working for the future, like trying to improve my game as much as I can, just so I'm ready for whoever is going to bring the challenge on court.""The victory was particularly significant as Sabalenka had finished as runner-up last year, losing to Iga Swiatek, whom Gauff defeated in this year's semi-final.This win represented Sabalenka's sixth final appearance this year and the 37th of her career, marking her fourth final in five years at Madrid.The three-time Grand Slam champion's current form positions her as a leading contender for the French Open, where Swiatek claimed her last title almost a year ago.The result brought Sabalenka level at 5-5 in head-to-head matches against Gauff.""Overall there's a lot of positives to take but I'm obviously disappointed with maybe how I played today. I feel like I could have showed up better,"" Gauff reflected after the match.","Aryna Sabalenka beats Coco Gauff 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) in Madrid Open final.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

Bombay Sport Exchange Episode 3: Kane Williamson exclusive on NextGen cricketers to watch out for

The International Cricket Council ( ICC ) has reportedly demanded an explanation from Cricket Canada how Salman Khan became Chief Executive in January 2025, weeks before Calgary Police charged him with theft and fraud of CAD 200,000 from the Calgary & District Cricket League. As per, in ICC's letter dated May 2, 2025, they seek clarification on the due diligence conducted and remedial actions taken after Khan and former league treasurer Syed Wajahat Ali were charged for incidents between 2014 and 2016.The ICC's correspondence requests detailed information about the recruitment process, whether directors were informed of allegations before Khan's appointment, when the board learned of the investigation, and what governance actions have been taken. The letter emphasised the severity of charges against Khan regarding his conduct as a cricket administrator.Cricket Canada announced an investigation into the allegations against Khan in April, but no updates have been provided since. Khan has denied any wrongdoing.""Reports of my arrest are completely false,"" Khan stated.Provincial administrators have indicated that the Calgary case was known in local cricket circles before the charges were filed, creating a difficult situation for the board to demonstrate proper care in its appointment process.Khan's appointment has raised several concerns. He was initially elected as a Board Director in June 2023 but resigned from his two-year honorary term to take the paid CEO position. Some suggest this early resignation was strategic, as board bylaws require directors charged with crimes to step down.Board Chair Amjad Bajwa and Director Imran Rana reportedly negotiated Khan's CEO appointment without sharing contract details with other directors. The five-year contract notably lacks an at-will termination clause, potentially requiring Cricket Canada to pay the full term if Khan is removed early.Significant commercial changes followed Khan's appointment as CEO. After ending a 25-year contract with Bombay Sports, the GT20 owners, in December 2024, Cricket Canada established a new long-term agreement with National Cricket League Canada to operate the GT20 brand.The NCL partnership has drawn scrutiny as the ICC had banned them from receiving sanction for future events due to repeated rules violations. Three directors reported that the NCL contract was approved without sharing complete terms with the board.An alternative proposal from UAE-based ILT20, an ICC-sanctioned league, was never presented to the Board for review.The key events unfolded as follows: Khan was elected as Cricket Canada director in June 2023, became CEO in January 2025, and was charged by Calgary Police on March 12, 2025. Cricket Canada announced consultations with legal experts on March 13, revealed the GT20 partnership with NCL Canada on April 14, and received the ICC's formal query on May 2.Cricket Canada must respond to the ICC's four questions within 14 days. The response's thoroughness and evidence of proper director communication will determine if the matter concludes with clarification or proceeds to disciplinary measures.Associate members risk funding freezes or administrative intervention if they fail to meet ICC standards.","The International Cricket Council ( ICC ) has reportedly demanded an explanation from Cricket Canada.

prediction

Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) will be desperate to turn their fortunes around at Eden Gardens when they face Rajasthan Royals (RR) in a crucial IPL clash on Sunday. With four league matches left, the equation for the defending champions is clear: win all four and qualify for the playoffs.Skipper Ajinkya Rahane, recovering from a hand injury, confirmed his intent to play: “I’m fine. I’m trying my best and hopefully I’ll play the match on Sunday.”KKR have struggled at home this season, with just one win from five outings. Their spinners have failed to exploit home conditions, and the batting unit has underperformed. Vice-captain Venkatesh Iyer, re-signed for Rs 23.75 crore, has been underwhelming with only 142 runs in 10 games.Rinku Singh and Quinton de Kock have also failed to fire consistently, making KKR's task steeper. However, their recent 14-run win over Delhi Capitals, led by Sunil Narine’s all-round brilliance, has reignited belief.Eliminated RR, meanwhile, have little to lose and could play party spoilers. With captain Sanju Samson absent and Jos Buttler gone, RR’s young guns will need to step up to salvage pride in what’s been a disappointing campaign.There’s a lush covering of grass, especially around the good and short of a length areas, promising consistent bounce and pace at Eden Gardens. Early swing is expected in the powerplay, so pacers must pitch it up and make the most of the movement. Unlike typical Eden conditions, the even grass cover means spinners may find it tough, with little turn likely. This pitch looks set for a high-scoring contest, but the new ball will be crucial. Early wickets could tilt the game, so exploiting swing early on will be key for the bowlers before it becomes a batter’s paradise.Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Andre Russell, Rovman Powell, Harshit Rana, Anukul Roy, Varun ChakaravarthyImpact Player – Vaibhav Arora/Ramandeep SinghYashasvi Jaiswal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Nitish Rana, Riyan Parag (c), Dhruv Jurel (wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Wanindu Hasaranga, Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana, Sandeep Sharma, Yudhvir Singh CharakImpact Player - Akash Madhwal/Shubham DubeyAjinkya Rahane (c), Rinku Singh, Quinton de Kock (wk), Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Rovman Powell, Manish Pandey, Luvnith Sisodia, Venkatesh Iyer, Anukul Roy, Moeen Ali, Ramandeep Singh, Andre Russell, Anrich Nortje, Vaibhav Arora, Mayank Markande, Spencer Johnson, Harshit Rana, Sunil Narine, Varun Chakaravarthy and Chetan Sakariya.Sanju Samson (c), Riyan Parag, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shimron Hetmyer, Shubham Dubey, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Dhruv Jurel (wk), Kunal Singh Rathore, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Nitish Rana, Sandeep Sharma, Tushar Deshpande, Akash Madhwal, Kumar Kartikeya, Kwena Maphaka, Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Ashok Sharma and Jofra Archer.Played: 31KKR wins: 15RR wins: 14No Result: 2Expect a damp start to the day in Kolkata with a couple of soaking morning showers, particularly around 11 AM when cloudy skies and rain are likely.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli has once again shown why he’s considered one of the greatest batters in IPL history . On Saturday night against Chennai Super Kings , the Royal Challengers Bengaluru star smashed a brilliant 62 off just 33 balls, putting to rest all the chatter around his strike rate and intent.Former India cricketer Mohammed Kaif summed it up best in a post on X: ""Very impressive, very aggressive, very very Virat Kohli.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli's greatness in the Indian Premier League isn't just defined by runs — it's stamped by the sheer consistency and impact he's had, especially against top-tier opponents. Among all franchises, no team has witnessed Kohli’s fury more than Chennai Super Kings, one of the most successful sides in IPL history.

NEW DELHI: Rashid Khan , Afghanistan's T20I captain , expressed on Saturday that Shubman Gill would emerge as an exceptional leader for both Gujarat Titans in the IPL and the Indian cricket team . This season, Gill has demonstrated remarkable leadership , amassing 465 runs across 10 matches at an average of 51.66, including six half-centuries.""Shubman Gill, this is his second year leading the team and he has been getting better and better each and every game,"" Rashid shared during a media interaction.""In the future definitely he is going to be one of the very, very good leaders for India, not only GT but for India as well.

The length and the line, that's something which gives me a clear idea that yes, it's not just about the batter, I missed my line and length.""If I miss my line and length on any day, I feel any batter is going to score runs against me. I think the length and the line was missing but I just need to focus on that.

Arsenal faced a setback before their Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain as Bournemouth secured their first-ever away victory against them with a 2-1 win, while Aston Villa strengthened their top five aspirations by defeating Fulham 1-0 on Saturday, May 4, 2025, in London.Arsenal initially took control when Declan Rice scored in the first half during his 100th appearance for the club.The lead was short-lived as Dean Huijsen equalised, followed by Evanilson's winning goal for Bournemouth.The defeat comes at a crucial time for Arsenal, who are already trailing 1-0 to PSG in their Champions League semi-final first leg and face the return leg in Paris on Wednesday.Arsenal, currently in second place, need six more points to secure Champions League qualification through a top-five Premier League finish.The London club has finished as runners-up to Manchester City in the previous two seasons and now sees the Champions League as their only remaining chance for silverware this term.Arsenal's last Champions League final appearance was in 2006, and they have never won the competition.""We should have put the game to bed. We defended really poorly, nowhere near the standards that we are used to. We wanted to generate the momentum and a really positive vibe today and we haven't. What we have created is frustration, rage and anger. Make sure we use that on Wednesday,"" said Arteta.At Villa Park, Unai Emery's team continued their impressive home form as Youri Tielemans' header in the 12th minute secured victory against Fulham.Villa, now in seventh place, extended their unbeaten home streak to 20 games across all competitions, drawing level on 60 points with sixth-placed Nottingham Forest and fifth-placed Chelsea.""If we weren't winning today, forget it completely. Today, we got more or less to be close to Europe. Wow, fantastic, brilliant. The best gift we can achieve after it is the Europa League or Champions League. We will fight for it, Europe, and hopefully we can fight for the Champions League,"" said Emery.In other matches, Southampton 's struggles continued as they lost 2-0 to Leicester at the King Power Stadium, risking equaling Derby's record-low Premier League points total.Jamie Vardy, who recently announced his departure from Leicester, scored his 199th goal for the club in the 17th minute.The match saw an unusual delay when referee David Webb suffered a head injury after colliding with Leicester's Jordan Ayew, with Vardy playfully blowing the referee's whistle during the treatment break.Ayew later scored Leicester's second goal before halftime, securing their first victory since January.Southampton, having lost 28 of 35 league games, have three matches remaining to avoid sharing Derby's record-low 11-point total from 2007-08.In the day's other fixture, relegated Ipswich showed resilience by coming back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Everton.Everton had taken a commanding lead through Beto and Dwight McNeil's goals, but Julio Enciso's long-range strike and George Hirst's late equaliser secured a point for Ipswich.The match marked Everton's penultimate game at Goodison Park, with their final match at the historic venue scheduled against Southampton on May 18 before moving to their new Bramley-Moore Dock stadium next season.","Bournemouth secure their first-ever away victory against Arsenal with a 2-1 win.

Indian coach will hope for a treble against Manolo as JFC take on

in Super Cup final

BHUBANESWAR: It’s the last mile of the season and two of the teams remaining out of 15 will battle it out for the Kalinga Super Cup here on Saturday.While Jamshedpur FC will be eager to script their first Super Cup title, FC Goa will play their hearts out to claim their second trophy of the tournament and give their outgoing coach Manolo Marquez a fitting farewell.But along with the title, a victory in the final at Kalinga Stadium will earn the winners a ticket to the AFC Champions League 2 Preliminary Round.The Gaurs have already had a taste of continental football at the 2021 AFC Champions League. But it’s uncharted territory for the Red Miners. “For us, it’s very important because it would be the first time that we qualify for an Asian competition, so we’ll try to give our best,” JFC head coach Khalid Jamil said at the pre-match press conference on Friday.But having lost out on their trophy hopes in the ISL semifinal, Goa will leave no stone unturned in their quest for the continental pass.“When you have this opportunity (to qualify for Asia), obviously you have to be very motivated. FC Goa already played in the Champions League four years ago. Jamshedpur never did. But both teams would want to make it to this competition,” were Marquez’s words at the pre-match interaction.While Goa have a better head-to-head statistic over Jamshedpur overall, Jamil’s men have done a double on them this ISL season and will be keen for a treble against their rivals on Saturday.Both coaches, however, refused to dwell on the past.“Every game is different. We can say that we finished second and Jamshedpur finished 10 points below us, but we lost both games against them. They were much better in Jamshedpur. In Goa, maybe in the first half we were better and they were better in the second. But now, it’s a final, and I think it’s not important what happened in the past,” added Marquez.The Spaniard’s words were echoed by his Indian counterpart at the joint media interaction when he too termed the final “a totally different game”.And to claim the honours on the day, Jamshedpur will bank on their defensive unit — led by Stephen Eze and comprising a mix of youth and experience in Ashutosh Mehta, Pronay Halder and Mohd Uvais — that stood strong against Mumbai City FC in their 1-0 semifinal win.Rei Tachikawa, who scored the winner, will also have to play a pivotal role in midfield along with skipper Javier Hernandez, while the scoring prowess of Jordan Murray and Javier Siverio will be crucial to earn Jamshedpur their first trophy.On the other hand, Goa’s semifinal star Borja Herrera will need to keep up his season’s form along with ISL’s Emerging Player of the Season, Brison Fernandes, and hat-trick scorer in the last 16, Iker Guarrotxena, in their bid to break the Red Miners’ defence.Skipper Odei Onaindia and veteran Sandesh Jhingan, meanwhile, will be crucial in holding the Gaurs’ fort against the striking threats from Jamshedpur.“Fifteen teams tried to win the tournament. We knew that we had to win four games and, thanks to the team, we won three. There are no easy games here. So let’s see what happens,” was Marquez’s assessment of the summit clash.But whoever wins, with both coaches having full squads at their disposal, it’s expected to be a thrilling finale to the Indian domestic season.",Jamshedpur FC take on FC Goa in the Kalinga Super Cup final on Saturday.

Manchester City secured a crucial 1-0 victory against Wolves at the Etihad Stadium on Friday, with Kevin De Bruyne scoring the winning goal to boost their Champions League qualification hopes, moving them to third place in the Premier League standings.City have now won five consecutive matches in all competitions for only the second time this season, providing a significant lift to their European ambitions.The win gives City a four-point cushion over sixth-placed Nottingham Forest, who have a game in hand against Crystal Palace on Monday, while fourth-placed Newcastle and fifth-placed Chelsea also have matches in hand.The match marked one of De Bruyne's final appearances at the Etihad, as the 33-year-old Belgian midfielder will not receive a contract extension when his current deal expires at the end of the season.""We are better than we were weeks ago. If we play like we did today, it is really good but we cannot relax. Winning in that way is good because it will make us realise that we still need to work,"" Guardiola said.De Bruyne's goal was only his sixth of the season, reflecting his injury-plagued decline over the past two years that influenced Guardiola's decision to release him.""A lot of teammates have said that it's sad I have to go, but that's just how it goes sometimes in life. I don't know what the future will be, but I know that I can still play here. I try to play as much good football as I can. I'm still enjoying it,"" De Bruyne said.""Just thank you. His contribution in the game against Crystal Palace when we were 2-0 down and he delivers, and today the goal again. I want the best for Kevin. It cannot be possible to have done these many years without him. He has been an incredible player but the situation is what it is. It's almost impossible to replace this kind of player,"" Guardiola said about De Bruyne.Erling Haaland returned from his ankle injury but remained an unused substitute, surprising many observers.Wolves entered the match with confidence after achieving six consecutive top-flight victories for the first time since 1970-71.The visitors nearly took the lead when Rayan Ait-Nouri hit the post from close range, with his follow-up attempt cleared off the line by Josko Gvardiol.City broke the deadlock in the 35th minute through a well-orchestrated move. Ilkay Gundogan passed to Jeremy Doku , who beat his marker and found De Bruyne unmarked in the Wolves area. The Belgian finished past goalkeeper Jose Sa.Wolves continued to threaten in the second half, with Matheus Cunha striking the post from the edge of the area.The victory keeps City on track to avoid missing Champions League qualification for the first time since 2010-11, though their four-year reign as English champions has already ended with Liverpool claiming the title.City still have three matches remaining in their campaign and can also look forward to an FA Cup final against Crystal Palace.",Manchester City beat Wolves 1-0 at the Etihad Stadium on Friday.

From fancy dress competition to the national team: Brison Fernandes looks to keep journey going,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/from-fancy-dress-competition-to-the-national-team-brison-looks-to-keep-journey-going/articleshow/120833543.cms,"Bhubaneswar: It has already been quite a journey for Brison Fernandes from the scenic south Goa village of Loutolim to the centrestage of Indian football .And, on Friday, when the youngster’s name was announced from the stage as AIFF’s Most Promising Men’s Player of the Year, he could have been reminded of another stage, albeit at a kindergarten, where winning a fancy dress competition had sparked his passion for the game.“I was in KG 2 or something and there was a fancy dress competition in my school. And my ‘dada’ (father) bought me a Brazil national team jersey and shoes. So I was a football player in that competition. And I won that competition,” reminisced Brison during an exclusive chat with TOI. “So, from that day onwards, I fell in love with this game.”Yet, with no proper playground in his village, Brison forced his reluctant friends to accompany him to a ground further away every evening to play the game he had fallen in love with.Having been gifted with the enthusiasm for sports like his parents, Brison played at the U12 level in his school before joining Goa-based Salgaocar FC’s U14 squad. Two years later, he was brought to FC Goa academy by well-known Goan scout Jaoquim Crasto.“When I was 15 or 16, I joined FC Goa. Then onwards, I played U18 there for maybe three seasons and then went on to pro league. And then into the senior squad,” said the youngster who went on to win the Durand Cup in 2021 with FC Goa senior squad, after title wins in Goa Professional League and Goa Police Cup with the developmental team.But that can change on Saturday if Goa can win the Super Cup. And Brison would love to do that as a parting gift for Manolo Marquez, who will forego the club reins after it.“He (Marquez) gave me this opportunity, you know. Coach Carlos (Pena) also did that, but not as much as I used to get a chance to play in the second half. But coach Manolo believed in me. And I want to give him this trophy in return,” said the ISL Emerging Player of the Season .While Marquez has been vocal in his appreciation of this “typical Goan player”, the 24-year-old has worked hard to be ready for the 7 goals and 2 assists for FC Goa this season after a lukewarm first two seasons in ISL.“I didn’t take a break after last season because I wanted to achieve something. And to achieve something without putting in hard work is impossible. I know I have talent. But without hard work it’s nothing,” explained the in-form winger who also scored Goa's opener in the Super Cup semifinal against Mohun Bagan Super Giant.His ISL form this season also earned him his maiden national team call-up, something that he had always been waiting for, against Bangladesh in the Asian Cup 2027 qualifier last month.“It’s always a proud feeling wearing that badge and representing your people which I’ve always wanted to. I want to live that moment forever,” Brison said with a glimmer in his eyes as he recollected the moment when he got onto the Shillong pitch as a second-half substitute. “At first, I felt very nervous. But after 1-2 passes, I began to feel comfortable. Coach Manolo also helped me a lot.”One can imagine it was a first of many such moments given his current form and the problem of finding good Indian attackers daunting Marquez at the helm of the national team. And come Saturday, Brison could help his team bid a fitting adieu to the Spanish coach while adding the second senior trophy in his journey with FC Goa.",FC Goa winger Brison Fernandes named AIFF's Most Promising Men’s Player of the Year.

In a major step to deepen its engagement with Indian fans and support the growth of football across the country, the English Premier League announced the opening of its new office in Mumbai on Wednesday. This marks the latest expansion of the League’s global footprint and its enduring association with India’s burgeoning football community.The Mumbai office aims to bolster the Premier League's efforts to grow the sport at both grassroots and elite levels, while also enhancing connections with fans and stakeholders in the region. The office will serve as a hub for collaboration with local authorities, the Indian Super League (ISL), and governing bodies, helping to further integrate the Premier League’s programs and initiatives within India’s footballing ecosystem.Premier League Chief Executive Richard Masters underscored the importance of this move. “We and our clubs have a fantastic and knowledgeable fanbase in India, and we know football continues to grow in popularity. We are proud of our longstanding commitment to India, having worked to deliver community football programmes for 18 years and, more recently, our partnership with the Indian Super League,” he said. “Opening this office marks a significant milestone for the Premier League. It will allow us to operate more effectively locally as we build on our existing work to establish more ways to strengthen our relationship with fans, JioStar and other partners.”The Premier League’s connection with India began in 2007 through the Premier Skills initiative, in partnership with the British Council. Over the past 18 years, the program has trained more than 7,300 coaches and referees across 18 Indian states, positively impacting over 124,000 young people. At the elite level, the League’s alliance with the ISL since 2014 has resulted in meaningful collaboration in areas such as youth development, coaching standards, and referee training.Additionally, the Next Gen Cup — an elite youth tournament co-hosted with the ISL and Reliance Foundation — continues to foster top-level talent. The sixth edition of the event is set to take place in Mumbai in May 2025, featuring U19 teams from both Premier League clubs and ISL academies.This marks the fourth international office for the Premier League, after successful launches in Singapore (2019), New York (2023), and Beijing (2024), as the League continues to globalise its fan engagement and development initiatives.","The EPL has opened a new office in Mumbai.

Oliver Rowland on his winning strategy

Oliver Rowland showed who’s the boss on the first day of the Monaco E-Prix . The Nissan driver went on to win the Round 6 on Saturday, registering his third win of the 2024–25 Formula E World Championship . The 32-year-old hinted that they would have been enjoying the champagne after the sweet victory but since this is a double header, the party will have to wait till Sunday. The Round 7 of the Miami E-Prix is scheduled on Sunday.Talking about his quick strategy that resulted in a win for him, Oliver Rowland said, “You never know what to do with the strategy especially with these Pit Boost races - it’s the second race but we kind of had a plan and we stuck to it. It was a bit trickier to pass Taylor [Barnard] to be honest, but we kept calm - even at the end I was pretty worried during that second Attack Mode: I dropped back to fifth and I was behind two Mahindra's, and I was like ‘right now we need to get cracking’, but great job by the team and very well executed.”The 32-year-old added, “I was thinking Taylor was pushing the barriers of the rules at some points, but fair play to him - in the end we got the job done so it doesn’t really matter. We’ve started the season really well, but it feels a bit different now. Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne but you’ve already got one eye on tomorrow.”A key factor in Rowland's success was the strategic deployment of Pit Boost by Nissan, allowing him to overtake polesitter NEOM McLaren driver Taylor Barnard on Lap 13. Despite briefly losing the lead to Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries on Lap 26, Rowland masterfully utilised his final Attack Mode on Lap 27 to reclaim the lead, ultimately winning the race by a comfortable two-second margin.Also Read: Monaco E-Prix Round 6: Oliver Rowland wins, Nyck de Vries second, Jake Dennis secures third spot on podium despite penalty Rowland is currently on top of the FIA Drivers' World Championship standings with 94 points.

Pit Boost in Formula E double-headers

Nissan driver Oliver Rowland won Part 1 of the Monaco E-Prix on Saturday. He is already leading the Formula E Drivers' Standings this year, and the much-awaited win adds to his score. Nyck de Vries of Mahindra Racing secured the second spot on the podium. Andretti driver Jake Dennis managed to claim the third spot despite a 5-second penalty.The race began with qualifying winner NEOM McLaren’s Taylor Barnard on pole position, followed by good friend — Nissan’s Oliver Rowland — and then Cupra Kiro driver Dan Ticktum, who topped both free practice sessions.The race ended early for TAG Heuer Porsche driver António Félix da Costa, who crashed into the wall and retired. He remains the only Formula E driver in the last five years to have won both pole and the race in the same event — in 2021. He had finished third in the previous race in Miami.Mitch Evans of Jaguar TCS Racing, who won the last Monaco E-Prix, came to a halt during the race and struggled to get going again, losing precious time as others overtook him.Oliver Rowland was among the first to use Attack Mode and established his dominance in the race. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries and TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein came close to Rowland when others took the mandatory Pit Boost. Soon after, Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy moved up to challenge for second position.Where did pole winner Taylor Barnard go? He crashed into the wall and was seen reversing his vehicle to rejoin the race. Andretti driver Jake Dennis could have secured a higher podium finish, but he was hit with a 5-second penalty for overspeeding during the full-course yellow when António Félix da Costa’s car was being removed from the crash site.Pit Boost is a feature introduced in Formula E double-headers. The electric Gen3 Evo cars receive a 10 percent energy boost (3.85 kWh) via a 30-second, 600kW charge in the pit lane. However, a driver can use this advantage only once across the two races in a double-header.","Nissan driver Oliver Rowland won Part 1 of the Monaco E-Prix on Saturday.

The Monaco E-Prix is here, and all the world is talking about is the stunning Circuit de Monaco and who the two drivers will be to win the double-header this year. However, there is also something very special about celebrating a win at the Monaco race. In 2021, a Formula E driver Antonio Felix Da Costa —who raced for Techeetah-DS at the time—did a high-altitude jump into a swimming pool to celebrate his victory at the race. He now races for Tag Heuer Porsche .The video of Antonio Felix Da Costa’s iconic 2021 celebration after winning the Monaco E-Prix was shared by Formula E’s social media handles to revisit the famous moment.

He didn’t show even an iota of hesitation and dove right in without a second thought.The moment was shown on television in the video, with an anchor also mentioning his hair flip as he lifted his head out of the water after the epic dive.Reacting to the video, a fan wrote on Instagram, “That’s a little bit too high for comfort.” Another commented, “Epic! Let's gooooo Antonio!” One more said, “Let’s do another one this weekend.” An Instagram user called it “The most iconique celebration ever.” A comment also read: “Portuguese do it Better.”Antonio is also among the favourites to win the race. He recently took the third spot on the podium at the Miami E-Prix, which had Pascal Wehrlein as the winner and Lucas Di Grassi in second place.The 33-year-old Portuguese driver is also a surfer.

Earlier Monaco E-Prix Winners

The stage is set for the Monaco E-Prix, and among the favourites are Mitch Evans , Oliver Rowland, António Félix Da Costa , and Nick Cassidy. With Monaco hosting a double-header for the first time, there are even more opportunities for new names—or different combinations—to climb the podium this weekend. But before that, let’s take a look at the six winners of the Monaco E-Prix so far.Interestingly, since the Monaco E-Prix adopted the full 3.337 km layout at the Circuit de Monaco, no pole-sitter has gone on to win the race.2022: Jaguar’s Mitch Evans started from pole but finished second. Stoffel Vandoorne of Mercedes claimed the win.2023: McLaren’s Jake Hughes took pole but didn’t make the podium. Nick Cassidy of Envision Racing won, followed by Evans in second and Andretti’s Jake Dennis in third.2024: Pascal Wehrlein secured pole for Porsche but also failed to finish on the podium. Jaguar dominated the race, with Evans taking the win and teammate Cassidy finishing second. Stoffel Vandoorne, now with DS Penske, completed the podium in third.The 2021 race was an exception to the recent trend. It was the first time Formula E used the full Monaco layout, and the pole-sitter went on to win the race. That year, António Félix da Costa achieved the double for Techeetah-DS. His recent third-place finish at the Miami E-Prix shows he’s still in strong form with Tag Heuer Porsche. Robin Frijns (Virgin-Audi) finished second in 2021, while Mitch Evans took third that year.Meanwhile, Sébastien Buemi of e.dams Renault remains the only driver to have won the Monaco E-Prix twice—and in consecutive editions. He triumphed in 2015 and 2017, during a period when the race was held biennially. On both occasions, Lucas Di Grassi (ABT Sportsline) finished second. Di Grassi is currently showing strong form again, having secured second place for Lola Yamaha ABT in the recent Miami race. In 2019, it was Jean-Éric Vergne of Techeetah-DS who claimed victory.The official Formula E Instagram handle recently shared a poster featuring the six different winners of the Monaco E-Prix, accompanied by the caption: “Will anybody join the exclusive list of #MonacoEPrix winners?”Also Read: Monaco E-Prix 2025: Formula E set for yet another double-header, here’s all about the most loved race of the year Predicting this weekend’s results, one fan wrote: “Oliver Rowland first, Jake Dennis second, and Pascal Wehrlein in third.” Rowland received plenty of support in the comments, with even the Formula E page noting: “A lot of love for @oliverrowland1 here.”","Mitch Evans, Oliver Rowland, António Félix Da Costa and Nick Cassidy are among the favourites to win this weekend's Monaco E-Prix.

Mahindra Racing is driving at an altogether different speed this season as the Formula E team has already surpassed their Season 10 points total in just five races. There are 11 more rounds to go, with the next in Monaco in May. And with such a wonderful performance this year, the Indian outfit is surely on the way to making history. Mahindra Racing drivers Edoardo Mortara and Nyck De Vries can rightfully take the credit for making the team reach a prominent place in the competition.Mahindra Racing’s achievement was highlighted by Formula E, which shared a post on Instagram to laud the team. The picture of team drivers Edoardo Mortara and Nyck De Vries was captioned: “What a turnaround from @MahindraRacing surpassing their Season 10 points total in the first 5 rounds,” along with clapping emojis.The team was struggling at just 47 points last season, but it has already made 51 points in 5 rounds out of 16 races. As a result, it’s in fifth position in the Teams' Standings this year. While Mortara stands at 8th position in the Drivers' Standings with 27 points, De Vries is at 11th position with 24 points.In its run so far in Formula E’s inaugural season, Mahindra Racing has participated in 136 races, out of which it has won just 5 and clinched 24 podiums. They are yet to win a pole position or a podium this season so far, but it's great going and good results are sure to follow.The current season has seen a lot of ups and downs already. It started on a strong note for the team as Mortara and De Vries managed to take 5th and 6th positions in the season opener Sao Paulo E-Prix, respectively. De Vries slipped to 8th position in the second race in Mexico, whereas Mortara failed to leave an impression. The two bounced back strongly at Jeddah E-Prix Round 1, where De Vries climbed to an impressive 4th position and Mortara finished 7th. But they once again slipped to 10th and 13th positions in Round 2.At the Miami E-Prix this month, Mortara once again bounced back by clenching 5th position, but De Vries finished 11th in the race. Team principal Frederic Bertrand is always seen encouraging the drivers and had written after the impressive Miami E-Prix, “We keep pushing, fighting, improving! Great job @mahindraracing this week-end in Miami!

Where are India’s singles tennis players?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/where-are-indias-singles-tennis-players/articleshow/120843273.cms,"L-R: India's No.1 & 2 singles players - Sumit Nagal and Mukund Sasikumar

The country has 9 players in the top 150 of individual doubles rankings, but doubles titles are not an indicator of the state of the game...

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

Poll Do you think Indian tennis is facing a decline in singles performance? No, it will improve. Yes, it's concerning.

In Feb, India hosted four ATP Challenger tournaments, categorized as the launch pad to the world stage.As the travelling circus pegged tents in Chennai, Delhi, Pune and Bengaluru, the common thread running through the tournaments was the lack of Indian presence in singles.Indian players featured in 13 first round, main draw singles matches in four weeks. Twelve of those 13 starts were courtesy wildcards.Only one player — Karan Singh in Bengaluru — came through the qualifying field.The most worrying stat was that out of the 13 starts the host nation had only one match win in four weeks — Mukund Sasikumar in Delhi.Former No. 1 Somdev Devvarman asked the question on every stakeholder’s mind: ‘Who are we holding these tournaments for?’Briton Jay Clarke, who stayed on in India for eight weeks in Feb-March, had an average run in the Challengers, but the 26-year-old won two titles from four finals in Futures events held in Chandigarh, Ahmedabad and Bengaluru.Agreed, the India No. 1 Sumit Nagal, presently ranked 165, the only Indian in the top 450 of the ATP rankings, was competing in South America at the time. Still, this performance, or the lack of it at home in the biggest events India host, is unacceptable.At the same time, in these very weeks in Feb, India had a presence in the doubles final in all four Challengers, finishing with two titles, even though our best doubles players — Yuki Bhambri and Rohan Bopanna — were part of richer draws elsewhere in the world.India has nine players in the top 150 of the individual doubles ranking, thanks to Bopanna’s ‘Doubles Dream of India’, a programme that supports Indian doubles pros. It was launched in April 2022 and offers resources like travelling coaches, physios and organizes pre-season camps.It is in singles, however, where Indian tennis enjoyed stirring success dating back to the 1960s.There was Ramanathan Krishnan, twice Wimbledon semifinalist 1960-61. Vijay Amritraj was a four-time Grand Slam quarterfinalist who rose to No. 16 in the ATP rankings. Ramesh Krishnan won eight ATP singles titles, rising to No. 23 in the rankings. Leander Paes was Olympics singles bronze medallist (1996) who rose to No. 73. Devvarman spent all but 12 weeks between Aug 2010 and Jan 2012 ranked in the top 100, scaling to No. 62. In women’s, Sania Mirza – the pathbreaker — was ranked at a career-high No. 27 in singles.It was Paes (18 major titles, men’s doubles and mixed doubles) in tandem with Bhupathi (12), who created the doubles pathway for Indians. A route that was blazed by Bopanna, who at 45, is the sport’s poster boy for longevity. However, doubles and mixed doubles titles coming India’s way aren’t an indicator of the state of the game in the country.The most basic measure of the difference shows up in prize money on offer on the ATP Tour (not including Grand Slams), where in the 250, 500 and 1000 Series events, the singles prize money in a calendar year totals to $131,066,412 while the doubles pot is at $ 32,254,728. The difference in figures is four times.So, where then are India’s singles players? Devvarman — who has long fought the difficult fight, and last year hauled the All India Tennis Association to court for being a ‘serial offender’ in violating the Sports Code — said it was no coincidence that every player India has produced since the 40-year-old started playing, save for Bopanna, has moved out of the country to pursue the sport.“Our coaching system is not good enough,” he told TOI from his base in Chennai. “How can people who were coaching when I was coming up in 1990, still be coaching? If this is quality, then why hasn’t anybody coached outside India? Why don’t we have the experience and the expertise to at least take someone like Mukund Sasikumar (India’s No. 2, ranked 456) to the Grand Slam qualifiers stage? Indian tennis is missing young coaches to take us to the next level.”At a time when Indian sport has exploded in every other discipline, in areas like finance, expertise and audience attention, tennis appears to be receding into a deafening slowdown.Badminton has already seen its peak, chess is thriving, golf is flourishing, track and field is on the Olympic podium, the power disciplines — pugilists, wrestlers, lifters — are flexing their muscles and hockey is sounding the boards again. But tennis is languishing.The answer to the question of why India’s best junior talents are based outside the country lies in the closure of the National Tennis Centre in New Delhi last year. It had no great results to write home about in four years.Manas Dhamne, 17, ranked 760 in the ATP rankings, trains in Italy. Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi is 15 years old and is in Spain, as is 14-year-old Vedant Mohan, while the 12-year-old Bengaluru girl Srishti Kiran leaves in a week’s time for the United States. She’s on a 15-month tennis scholarship.Prajnesh Gunneswaran, the stylish left-hander who was ranked 75 six years ago when India had five men in the top 250 of the rankings, said the problem wasn’t about infrastructure or opportunities.“We don’t have the support staff with the fire or knowledge,” Gunneswaran, 35, said. “You can draw a line on a field and work with players if you know how to get things done. We have good infrastructure all over the country, but we haven’t produced a single player.”Last September, in a Davis Cup Group 1 clash against Sweden in Stockholm, the Indian think tank displayed a remarkable lack of imagination or ambition by playing a doubles specialist in a live singles tie, then ‘rewarded’ another player for loyalty instead of blooding a young talent who would’ve gained in experience.Gunneswaran pointed at Asian rivals China and Japan, who in the last 10 years have invested heavily in hiring top coaches and trainers from Europe to improve their game.China now has three men aged 28 and under in the top 75 of the ATP singles ranking and two women in the WTA top 50 while Japan has seven men in the top 200 and an equal number of women in the same range.“Now, 10 years later, the players that came through that system are investing back, helping the next generation of players,” he said.Sunder Iyer, secretary of the MSLTA and joint-secretary of the AITA, said the tournament cycle in the country had slowed to a trickle three-four years ago.“I accept that we have lost a generation of players,” Iyer said, “These last two-three years things have been better and we are already seeing results, like with the women in the Billie Jean King Cup recently, but there are things that we need to change in the tournament structure to help the younger crop of players.”Iyer added, “We need to do in singles what we have done in doubles. Nothing has been done so far. It is the parents who are working for their children’s progress.”The system is broken and until it’s fixed, it’s each player and their families to themselves. Tennis is a lonely sport, and in India there seems to be little love, especially for singles.","India has nine players in the top 150 of the individual doubles ranking. But doubles titles are not an indicator of the state of the game in the country. Indian players featured in 13 first round, main draw singles matches in four weeks. Only one player — Karan Singh in Bengaluru — came through qualifying field.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120843578,imgsize-54070,width-400,resizemode-4/Indias-singles-players.jpg"

Ruud overcame a rib issue to win 6-4, 7-5, while Draper secured a 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) victory.Ruud, who required a medical timeout due to chest and back discomfort, saved 15 of 18 break points during his one-hour 54-minute match against Cerundolo.""To be back in a Masters 1000 final feels great. It's not every day you get to play for these titles. I've been in two finals before and lost both, so hopefully it'll be third time is a charm,"" Ruud said.The Norwegian lost his previous Masters 1000 finals in Monte Carlo 2024 and Miami 2022, making this his third attempt at claiming a title at this level.Draper acknowledged the challenge ahead, praising his opponent's experience and achievements.""Casper is such an experienced player, someone who has made finals of two Grand Slams, is just a complete pro, and someone who always gives his best and is so tough to beat. He's in the final, he's playing well, and I'm going to have to bring my A-game for sure,"" Draper said.Ruud's match began with early difficulties, requiring him to save four break points in the opening game.At 2-1, he called for a medical timeout due to sharp chest and back pain.""Another good win for me against a tough player that I lost to earlier this year, so nice to get the revenge,"" said the 26-year-old Ruud.The second set featured five breaks of serve from 18 break point opportunities, with Ruud eventually prevailing.""I wasn't sure I was going to be able to finish the match, honestly. My physio took a look at it after and cracked my back up, which felt like a relief. Hopefully it's nothing too serious. I'll do everything we can, and I can, to feel better for tomorrow. Based on the way it felt, it shouldn't be too much to worry about for Sunday,"" Ruud explained.Ruud's performance will see him return to the top 10 rankings after previously dropping to 15th in the world.Draper, who improved to 4-0 in career meetings with Musetti, reached his second Masters 1000 final of the year.""I felt like both of us, our quality didn't drop from the first ball. Credit to Lorenzo, he's honestly playing so good on the clay. I've played him on the hard and on the grass in the juniors, growing up with him. But on the clay he's a different beast and so, to get this win, on this court, in this stage, in the semi-finals of this competition, honestly it means so much to me,"" Draper said.The 23-year-old British left-hander displayed impressive form, hitting 20 winners against 19 unforced errors during the two-hour match.This victory ensures Draper, who won the Indian Wells tournament on hard court in March, will enter the top five rankings next week.","Britain's Jack Draper and Norway's Casper Ruud advanced to the Madrid Open final on Friday.

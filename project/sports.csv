Gautam Gambhir pitch controversy | England Inspect Oval Pitch Freely, While India Were Kept away

TimesofIndia.com in London: Four Tests, 20 days of hard-fought cricket , and the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy is still alive as the two teams head into the finale at The Oval. The 2-1 scoreline, currently in favour of England, could have gone either way, and while India would be disappointed not to have it in their favour, they still have a bright shot at scoring the equaliser in London. Very little has separated the two sides since the opening Test in Leeds, but England have been the better side at closing the crucial moments, which have had a bigger impact on the complexion of the match.A new-look squad under new captain Shubman Gill was always going to find it challenging in this part of the world, but the slightly inexperienced side, undergoing a transition of sorts, gave a very good account of their skills and temperament in crunch situations. If anyone had predicted them to be this competitive and alive in the series after four Tests, they would have welcomed it with arms wide open when they left home in the first week of June. Almost two months and 59 sessions of hard-fought cricket later, the new coach-captain combination of Gautam Gambhir and Gill can well return home with a hand on the trophy, and a well-deserved scoreline of 2-2.It wasn't a partnership which took the organic route, as the retirements of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma and the availability concerns of Jasprit Bumrah meant India went looking for a young captain. Gill became the unanimous choice, and even though his exploits with the bat, especially away from home in the format, raised some questions, he got the backing of men who matter in the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and even well-wishers of Indian cricket.They saw potential and a leader in the making, and he has responded in emphatic fashion with the bat - 722 runs in four matches.The more you hear from him, the more you see him operate in the middle, the more you get a sense of the blueprint of Gill, the captain, the leader. The accidental partnership with Gambhir is also growing on the job, and the mutual respect and admiration between the two is a trailer of the potential blockbuster. It's only the Tests right now, but the partnership will sooner rather than later extend to the limited-overs too. That is a discussion for some other day.On the eve of the fifth Test, Gill was repeatedly asked about Gambhir's heated argument with the chief curator, but the Indian captain didn't make any politically correct statements. He stood by his coach, didn't quite understand ""what the fuss was about,"" and termed the entire episode as unnecessary.""What happened yesterday, I thought, is just absolutely unnecessary. I mean, it's not the first time that we were having a look at the wicket. And we have, we have been here for almost, I think two months. And like I said, a coach has every right to be able to go close quarters and have a look at the wicket. And I didn't think that there was anything wrong with that. I actually don't know why, why the curator would not allow us to go have a look at the wicket,"" said Gill.From a boy who used to come up with the choicest words during the media interactions, Gill has grown into the job and become far more expressive and candid with every session. He doesn't mind a laugh, takes the criticism on the chin and even while keeping cards close to his chest, drops substantial hints. The coach is a completely different personality when it comes to press conferences, and even otherwise, but the partnership is coming along nicely and could well be a defining one as the team gets ready for bigger challenges in the near future.By no means was the England tour a cakewalk. They have had to grapple with injury issues, availability concerns of their trump card Bumrah, movement of players in the batting order, quick-fixes to add depth, but one challenge at a time, they have dealt with it in their own fashion and stand just one push away from what will be a ""significant"" achievement.""Very significant. I mean, if you look at the kind of cricket that we have played, sometimes the scorecard of the series, as in where we are in the series, doesn't determine that. I think every match that we have played, it was very difficult to decide which team is going to win after four days of cricket. If we are able to do that for every match, for four matches coming outside of India with a relatively young team, I think it is going to be a big achievement for us if we are able to level the series. And the series has been a great learning curve for me. You know, there are some things that only experience, that you can only learn from experience. And I've learned so much from these four matches that we have played. And hopefully, we are going to finish on a high,"" said Gill with a lot of optimism and confidence.Before the series opener, he had said that he wanted to be the best batter in the series. After the Leeds defeat, Gambhir defended his young players and was not ready to single out any individual or moment responsible for the result.Cut to July 30: The two have stuck to their guns, literally walked the talk and are on the cusp of doing not many would have expected them to do in their maiden assignment together - challenge England in their own backyard and return with one hand on the Anderson-Tendulkar trophy.","Shubman Gill is already at his best as India's captain. The new-look squad under new captain Gautam Gambhir was always going to find it challenging in this part of the world. England have been the better side at closing the crucial moments, which have had a bigger impact on the complexion of the match.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123008066,imgsize-34788,width-400,resizemode-4/123008066.jpg"

Indian chess sensation Divya Deshmukh has made headlines by winning the FIDE Women’s World Cup at just 19 years old, but there's a distinction that needs clarification: she is a World Cup winner, not the World Champion.The current Women's World Champion title still belongs to Ju Wenjun of China, who secured her fifth title in April by defeating Lei Tingjie 6.5–2.5.Divya's victory at the World Cup, held in Batumi, Georgia, is no less remarkable. Entering as the 15th seed, she stunned the chess world by beating top-tier opponents, culminating in a thrilling final against India’s highest-ranked female player, Koneru Humpy.After the classical games ended in draws, the match went into rapid tiebreaks.In the first rapid game, Divya held her ground as White, forcing a draw. In the second, playing with the Black pieces, she showed nerves of steel. Humpy, under severe time pressure, made a few critical mistakes in the endgame, which Divya capitalised on to seal the title.What made this victory even more historic was that Divya became the fourth Indian woman and the 88th Indian overall to become a Grandmaster (GM).It’s a landmark achievement in a career that's just beginning to bloom.ALSO READ: Chess | 'Security protocol': Why Divya Deshmukh played World Cup-winning move inside empty venue While the World Cup is a prestigious knockout-format tournament, the World Championship is a separate title, usually determined through a longer match between a reigning champion and a challenger.Hence, while Divya is now a World Cup champion and a Grandmaster, Ju Wenjun remains the reigning World Champion.Crucially, Divya’s World Cup win has earned her a spot in the upcoming FIDE Women’s Candidates Tournament, the gateway to the World Championship match.The winner of the Candidates will earn the right to challenge the reigning World Champion, putting Divya firmly on the path to possibly claiming the ultimate crown in women’s chess.","Divya Deshmukh won the FIDE Women's World Cup in Batumi, Georgia.

Ben Stokes press conference: On Gautam Gambhir fight, injury update, workload, Manchester handshake

Will rain play spoilsport?



Pitch Report



India and England are set to face off in the fifth and final Test of the series, beginning Thursday at the Kennington Oval in London. With England leading 2-1, India will be aiming to square the series and avoid a series defeat.After an up-and-down performance in the Manchester Test, the Indian team faces a few key selection calls. While the batting unit delivered a spirited fightback, the bowling department lacked bite. Debutant Anshul Kamboj struggled with pace and accuracy, and the rest of the attack failed to build consistent pressure on the English batters.With Rishabh Pant ruled out due to injury, Dhruv Jurel is expected to return as the wicketkeeper in a direct replacement. In the bowling department, changes appear likely as India look to inject more sharpness and control into the attack.England, on the other hand, will be disappointed not to have wrapped up the series in Manchester, having dominated large portions of the match. A major concern for them heading into the final Test is the fatigue of their pace battery. Brydon Carse and Chris Woakes have featured in all four matches so far, and with workload management in mind, England are expected to rotate their fast bowlers.Adding to their woes is the absence of skipper Ben Stokes, who has been ruled out of the Oval Test due to a shoulder injury. Ollie Pope will lead the side in his absence. England have already announced four changes to their playing XI, bringing in Jacob Bethell, Gus Atkinson, Jamie Overton, and Josh Tongue.According to Accuweather, rain is expected during the first two days of the Test. This forecast could influence the toss decision, with the winning captain likely to opt to bowl first to exploit early seam and swing conditions.The Oval is known for offering one of the most balanced wickets in England. While the dry summer has made pitches behave similarly across venues, the Oval typically assists seamers on Day 1, becomes batting-friendly on Days 2 and 3, and offers some turn for spinners in the final two days.",India and England face off in the fifth and final Test of the series.

LONDON: There are strong winds of change in English cricket, with Indian corporates acquiring ownership of franchises in The Hundred. While there are some concerns that these acquisitions could impact the culture of English cricket, the RPSG Group — owners of the Lucknow Super Giants and Durban Super Giants — is focused on preserving the heritage of Lancashire County as they head into The Hundred season with Manchester Originals.The first step towards this has been appointing local boy Phil Salt as the captain of the franchise. However, RPSG Group chairman Sanjiv Goenka claimed that Jos Buttler had declined the offer to lead the side, as he felt he was a better player when not captaining. “I had discussions with Jos. He said he will captain the side if I insist. But I felt it was not right to force him. Salt is a product of Lancashire and has been doing really well. So, it made more sense to appoint him the captain,” Goenka told TOI.Goenka emphasised that it was imperative to honour the heritage and history of clubs like Lancashire. “We are conscious of the legacies of these clubs. We have acquired other legacy brands earlier as well. We understand the importance of preserving the legacy and heritage — like we are careful about Mohun Bagan,” Goenka said.“The heritage helps in a big way.You get a ready-made fanbase. Manchester is a very renowned sports city in the UK. The culture is very strong. The stadium has a good capacity. We understand that we need to retain the advantage,” he said.Salt, too, highlighted the culture of the city and its loyal fan base. “To captain Manchester Originals — in the city where I grew up, where I first fell in love with the game — is more than just an honour. We’ve got a strong squad, a loyal fan base, and a lot of ambition. I can’t wait to get stuck in and make this city proud,” Salt told TOI.“I’ve walked into Old Trafford as a boy with wide eyes, and now I walk in with the responsibility to lead a group of world-class players. I’m also excited to begin this new chapter under the RPSG Group and Dr. Goenka’s visionary leadership,” he added.Many IPL franchise owners and Indian corporates have ventured into various T20 leagues across the world. But Goenka feels The Hundred is a bit different — although not too dissimilar from the regular T20 format. “It’s just 20 balls less with a few changes in how an over is bowled. It’s pretty similar to T20,” Goenka said.However, Goenka also said that he is looking to tap into the expertise of the Lancashire management and bring about commonality in management across different teams. “There will be a commonality in management with the coaching staff and the medical staff. It is said that Lancashire has the best medical team. We can use that in a bigger way,” Goenka remarked.","RPSG Group chairman Sanjiv Goenka has appointed Phil Salt as the captain of Manchester Originals in The Hundred.

IND vs ENG: The Oval curator breaks silence on Gautam Gambhir's outburst ahead of 5th Test

Oval Pitch curator was ‘problematic’ for the Indian women’s team too



MUMBAI: Reports of India head coach Gautam Gambhir 's public spat with The Oval's curator Lee Fortis during the Indian team's practice session at the venue on Tuesday, ahead of the fifth Test invoked a feeling of 'deja-vu' in former BCCI & Mumbai umpire Marcus Couto More than 11 years back, on March 1, 2014 to be precise, Couto witnessed a similarly fiery verbal fight between Gambhir, then the Delhi captain (he was dropped from the Indian team at that time and bidding to make a comeback) and the pitch curator at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in Delhi, before a Vijay Hazare Trophy (for one-dayers) about the wicket for the match.Tension had been brewing between Gambhir and Kotla curator Venkat Sundaram that season, with Gambhir clearly unhappy about the pitch preparation at Kotla and preferring to play Delhi’s matches at the Roshanara Club instead. Sundaram had even accused Gambhir of abusing him during the Ranji Trophy , something which the feisty left-hander vehemently denied.""It was a Vijay Hazare Trophy match between Delhi and Punjab, in Delhi. It was my farewell game as a BCCI umpire, before we were recalled years later after the retirement age. We, the match officials, had gone to the Kotla for a pre-match meeting with the captains, Gambhir (Delhi) and Harbhajan Singh (Punjab), and then suddenly we saw Gambhir and the Delhi curator (not Sundaram) involved in a heated argument, following which Gambhir literally chased him out of the ground! Gambhir just wasn't happy with the pitch that the curator had prepared.To tell you the truth, the pitch was very bad, as the ball barely rose above ankle height in the match. Later, that maali (groundsman) told me that Gambhir was very aggressive with the curators,"" recalled Couto while talking to TOI on Wednesday.“I was reminded of that incident when I saw reports of Gambhir involved in a similar spat with The Oval curator yesterday,” he added.Interestingly, while Couto was umpiring in his final BCCI match, it was a List A debut for the other on-field umpire, Jiwanjot Singh. For the record, Punjab bowled out Delhi for 228 and won that match by four wickets, with star bat Yuvraj Singh scoring an unbeaten 95-ball 96.This isn’t the first time that a visiting team captain or coach has clashed with a curator before an international game. A similar clash, about the curator instructing the opposition players to not come too near the match pitch had occurred between Sri lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara and the then Wankhede curator, former India opener Sudhir Naik just before the historic 2011 World Cup final between India and Sri Lanka at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Years later, Naik recalled that tiff with the Lankan skipper while talking to this correspondent, “Will you tell Sachin (Tendulkar) to not come near the pitch?’ Sangakkara told me. ‘Don’t worry. Sachin will never come so near the pitch on match-eve,’ I replied.”Meanwhile, India’s batting coach Sitanshu Kotak wasn’t off the mark when he said that “everyone knows that The Oval curator isn’t the easiest man around.” It seems that Lee Fortis wasn’t very popular with the Indian women’s team which toured England and played a T20I match at The Oval on July 4.“Like in the case of the Indian men’s team, he was very rude to the Indian women’s team. He didn’t let the team practice peacefully on both the practice day and match day. It was difficult to conduct our bowling and fielding sessions with him around. Ultimately, the matter had to be escalated to the concerned authorities,” a source in the Indian women’s team told TOI.","Former BCCI & Mumbai umpire Marcus Couto witnessed a similarly fiery verbal fight between Gautam Gambhir and the pitch curator at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in Delhi.

Shubman Gill in elite company



NEW DELHI: India will take on England for the decisive fifth Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy at The Oval, starting from Saturday, and all eyes will be on skipper Shubman Gill — not just for his leadership, but for a landmark that is well within reach. The 25-year-old is just 32 runs short of completing 6,000 international runs across formats, a milestone that would cap off what has already been a historic series for the young captain.Gill has amassed 5,968 runs in 112 international matches at an average of 46.62 and a strike rate of 79.92, with 18 hundreds and 25 fifties to his name. His highest score remains a blistering 269.In the ongoing Test series against England, Gill has been in imperious form, notching up 722 runs in eight innings at an average of 90.25. He is the leading run-scorer in the series, having scored four centuries — including a composed 103 in the third innings of the fourth Test under challenging conditions.With that knock, Gill etched his name alongside cricketing legends. He became only the third captain in Test history to score four centuries in a single series, joining Don Bradman (1947–48 vs India) and Sunil Gavaskar (1978–79 vs West Indies).Gill is the only player ever to score four centuries in his debut Test series as captain, surpassing the previous joint record of three held by Bradman, Greg Chappell, Virat Kohli , Steven Smith, and Warwick Armstrong.Gill’s hundred at Old Trafford also ended a 35-year drought for Indian centurions at the venue — the last being Sachin Tendulkar ’s iconic 119 in 1990.In the World Test Championship era, Gill’s tally of nine centuries in just 67 innings equals Rohit Sharma’s record, achieved in 69 innings — underlining Gill's rapid rise as one of India’s most prolific all-format batters.","Gill has amassed 5,968 runs in 112 international matches at an average of 46.62 and a strike rate of 79.92.

Get ready for an exciting new chapter in a good way. I think the amount of economics that are going to get invested in cricket in England... The amount of enthusiasm they're going to see, the amount of increased fervour, the increased amount of attention they're going to see, hopefully is good for the sport, is good for the fans, is good for all of us who enjoy cricket. Nikesh Arora

With the London Spirit, our commitment is to make it the best franchise we can, make it consistently competitive, and bring in best-in-class cricket to the field. Satyan Gajwani

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced the completion of deals with ""six strategic partners"" for teams in The Hundred, with two more deals set to be finalised later. The partnerships, valued at over £975 million collectively, will inject more than £500 million into English and Welsh cricket, including £50 million dedicated to grassroots development. The deals mark a historic moment as The Hundred becomes the first UK sports competition to secure franchise partnerships of this scale.The six completed deals include Tech Titans acquiring 49% of London Spirit, Knighthead Capital Management taking 49% of Birmingham Phoenix, RPSG Group securing 70% of Manchester Originals, Sun TV Network Limited purchasing 100% of Northern Superchargers, GMR Group acquiring 49% of Southern Brave, and Washington Freedom taking 50% of Welsh Fire.The remaining two deals, which are on track for later completion, involve Reliance Group acquiring 49% of Oval Invincibles and Cain International & Ares Management taking 49% of Trent Rockets.Reliance Group and Cain International & Ares Management can complete their respective deals at a later date. ECB had offered investors the option of completing at a later date.London Spirit, for one, will now be co-owned by MCC and Tech Titans. A consortium of Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora, Times Internet Limited vice chairman Satyan Gajwani, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Silverlake Technology CEO Egon Durban had won stake in the team in February earlier this year. The remaining 51% stake in the franchise will be held by the MCC. Both parties will take operational control of the team on October 1, 2025.Speaking about the acquisition and association with London Spirit, Gajwani said, ""One of the best things about cricket is that its players come from all around the world. And so when you think about a city like London that's so diverse, that has such an eclectic audience, our hope is that every fan can find someone that feels relatable and approachable to them.""Arora, Gajwani and Durban will be on the London Spirit Board alongside four directors nominated by the Club - Julian Metherell as London Spirit Board Chair, Robert Lawson (CEO MCC) and Eoin Morgan (former England and London Spirit captain). The fourth nominee will be appointed later.The new investors will take operational control from October 1, 2025, with most operating their franchises in partnership with host clubs. The ECB will retain full ownership of the competition, maintaining control over regulations and matters affecting the wider game.Richard Thompson, ECB Chair, stated: ""With these new partners on board, we’re entering an exciting new phase and a seminal moment for cricket in England and Wales. Their global perspective and track record in elite sport and business will help us reimagine what’s possible — from deepening fan connections to attracting even more world-class players.""“Crucially, this investment will not only fuel the competition’s growth but also channel transformative levels of funding into our professional counties and grassroots game. This will ensure cricket continues to thrive at all levels across England and Wales for generations to come, supporting our broader ambitions to become the country’s most inclusive sport and driving cricket into harder to reach and under-served communities,” added Thompson.The ECB was advised throughout the process by Deloitte and the Raine Group as co-lead financial advisers, with Latham & Watkins and Onside Law LLP providing legal counsel.","The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced the completion of deals with ""six strategic partners"" for teams in The Hundred.

Poll Will Mohammed Siraj reach 200 international wickets in the final Test against England? Yes No

Ben Stokes press conference: On Gautam Gambhir fight, injury update, workload, Manchester handshake

NEW DELHI: As Team India gears up for the fifth and final Test against England at The Oval, all eyes will be on Mohammed Siraj , who stands just one wicket away from reaching a significant milestone — 200 international wickets. The landmark could come in London, where India are pushing to level the series 2-2 after a morale-boosting draw in Manchester.In a series marked by intensity and unpredictability, Siraj’s form will be crucial to India's chances. Though he was off-colour during the fourth Test at Old Trafford — leaking 140 runs in 30 overs with just one wicket — his overall contributions across the series remain valuable. With 14 wickets at an average of 39.71, Siraj is India’s joint-highest wicket-taker in the series alongside Jasprit Bumrah.Across 100 international matches, Siraj has picked up 199 wickets at an average of 29.09, including five five-wicket hauls. Tests have been his strongest format, where he has bagged 114 wickets in 40 matches at 31.84. Four of his five-wicket hauls in Tests have come outside Asia — one each in Australia, England, South Africa and the West Indies — underlining his effectiveness on overseas pitches.England have been a productive hunting ground for the pacer. In 10 Tests on English soil, Siraj has taken 37 wickets at 36.16, including a memorable 6/70 at Edgbaston earlier in this series. His last appearance at The Oval came during the ICC World Test Championship final against Australia, where he claimed five wickets, including a four-for in the first innings.With a milestone in sight and the series on the line, India will be hoping for another Siraj’s trademark 'Miyan Magic' once again.",Mohammed Siraj is just one wicket away from reaching 200 international wickets.

IND vs ENG: The Oval curator breaks silence on Gautam Gambhir's outburst ahead of 5th Test

Poll Do you think the curator's restrictions on pitch inspections were justified? Yes, they were necessary for pitch maintenance No, teams should inspect the pitch freely

On the eve of the high-stakes fifth and final Test at The Oval, India captain Shubman Gill broke his silence on the controversy involving head coach Gautam Gambhir and The Oval’s chief curator Lee Fortis, calling the incident “surprising” and questioning the curator’s conduct.The incident occurred during India’s training session on Tuesday, where Fortis allegedly instructed the Indian support staff to stay at least 2.5 meters away from the pitch. This directive reportedly angered Gambhir, who fired back, “You don’t tell any of us what we need to do, you have no right to tell us, you are just a groundsman, nothing beyond.” The confrontation escalated before batting coach Sitanshu Kotak intervened to diffuse the situation.Addressing the media on Wednesday, Gill said, “No instructions like this — we have played four matches and no one gave us any instruction. We have played cricket and I don’t understand what the fuss was about.”Gill further questioned the curator’s restrictions, especially regarding the team’s routine pitch inspections. “We have been playing for such a long time. We can look at the pitch wearing rubber spikes or barefoot.I don’t know why the curator didn’t allow that.”England captain Ben Stokes, who has been ruled out of the final Test due to a shoulder injury, offered a terse response when asked about the incident: “I don’t know, I wasn’t here.”While Stokes won’t feature in the series finale, he did take aim at the demanding scheduling, citing the uneven gaps between Tests. “The gaps between games could have been better. There were gaps of 8-9 days between matches and then 3-4 days as well,” he said.Gill echoed the toll the series has taken, noting, “Can’t remember a series where four games went till the last session.”With tensions simmering off the field and the series still alive at 2-1 in England’s favour, the Oval Test promises to be a fitting end to a gruelling and drama-filled contest.","India captain Shubman Gill breaks his silence on the controversy involving head coach Gautam Gambhir and The Oval’s chief curator Lee Fortis.

At first glance, 22-year-old Harshika Jain’s football ing roots don’t scream ‘history maker’. A girl from a business family in Mumbai’s plush Altamount Road, she was just another sports-loving kid who dabbled in everything from basketball to handball to hockey. But by the time she turned 11, football had kicked everything else aside.Two days ago, Harshika became the first Indian footballer to sign with a Romanian firstdivision club, joining Atletic Olimpia Gherla. No Indian has ever featured in Romania’s top two leagues before.Moving from India to play professional football at the European stage, Harshika is following in the footsteps of Bala Devi, Manisha Kalyan and Aditi Chauhan. Her signing isn’t just about international firsts; it’s also one of persistence, late-night training sessions, lockdown drills, and a young girl breaking into all-boys’ teams.Harshika’s football journey began at school, where she could always be found on the football ground. And she could be spotted quite easily, too, as she would be the only girl training with boys. It was the same in her locality, where she would always have to play with the other boys as no girls joined it.The move to Romania came through trial at Olimpia Gherla, where she impressed legendary coach Mirel Albon, the man behind Romania’s rise in women’s football.After 20 days of trial, the club offered her a contract.“It feels like family here,” Harshika told TOI. “And that’s important to me. I’m close to my family, and the club environment reflects that. They’ve welcomed me with open arms.” Despite going global, her dream remains rooted in national colours. “Wearing India’s jersey, that’s the dream. Always has been.”","Harshika Jain became the first Indian footballer to sign with a Romanian firstdivision club, joining Atletic Olimpia Gherla.

I don't think there's a player -- or anyone -- who has done more for Major League Soccer than Messi.I fully understand, respect, and admire his commitment to Inter Miami, and I respect his decision. Unfortunately, we have a long-standing policy regarding participation in the All-Star Game, and we had to enforce it.

From a mental health perspective, I feel a lot lighter, like a weight has come off my shoulders. It’s not something we drivers talk about very often, but the last few days have been a huge release of emotion and energy. It feels great. Even now, when I watch the videos back, I struggle to believe it’s actually done!”Nato had also shared a few pictures of himself and the Nissan team on Instagram after the end of the Formula E season. He had written in an Instagram post after the London E-Prix, “That’s a wrap for Season 11 of @fiaformulae. Top 3 in the Team and Manufacturer Championship.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further.

It wasn’t just Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy who held his top position in London. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries also secured back-to-back podiums by finishing second in both races at the London E-Prix. His strong performance at the ExCeL Arena helped Mahindra finish fourth in the Formula E Teams’ Championship and fifth in the Manufacturers’ Championship. He was joined on the podium on Sunday by Envision Racing’s Sébastien Buemi.Nyck de Vries’ double podium in London brought his season tally to three, having also finished second in Monaco. Reflecting on his second consecutive podium, de Vries said, “It was certainly a very challenging race. Obviously, Nick [Cassidy] didn’t want to get too low on energy compared to everyone behind, so he was making sure he stayed on the same energy level as us. That resulted in a bit of a concertina effect behind us. ”He added, “I’m very pleased to bring home another podium and secure P4 for our team, because they’ve done an incredible job. To think that last year we qualified last on merit, and now we’ve come such a long way to finish fourth in the championship — this is a great effort.I’m very proud of everyone at Mahindra.”Envision Racing’s Sebastien Buemi also earned his third podium of the season in London, finishing third behind Nick Cassidy and Nyck de Vries in Sunday’s Round 16. In a heartwarming moment, his three sons joined him on the podium. Buemi had previously won the Monaco E-Prix and taken a podium in Jakarta.Speaking about ending the season on a high while many others were caught in collisions, Buemi said, “In the end, it was important to not get caught up in those incidents. I think I was lucky enough to avoid them well. I saved quite a bit of energy at the beginning, and that basically allowed me to take Attack Mode properly. So, in the end, I’m very happy with that. It’s good for the Teams’ Championship, and it’s satisfying to finish strong and score good points after a tough qualifying. ”Also Read: Nick Cassidy bids Jaguar farewell, celebrates with girlfriend Nathalia Soliani at London E-Prix afterparty At the end, Nick de Vries stood in eighth and Sebastien Buemi in twelfth position in the Formula E Driver Standings.","Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries secured back-to-back podiums by finishing second in both races at the London E-Prix.

Nick Cassidy takes third spot in Driver Standings

N ick Cassidy seems to have all the luck on his side as he went on to win his third race of the season, just days after announcing his exit from Jaguar TCS Racing at the end of this season. The New Zealander won the London E-Prix Round 15 race at the ExCeL Arena on Saturday. He himself called the win “unbelievable,” which was also witnessed by his grandmother at the circuit.

To win here at home for Jaguar and our team, in front of a lot of our friends, family, and partners who are here today, is incredible.”Talking about their strategy and the car, he said, “I wasn’t the happiest guy this morning, but that was for a reason, and I knew we had good potential in the car. In that race, I was able to show that, which is pretty cool.To be honest, it was a little bit fluid — a huge shoutout to my strategy team. I was really scared about not coming out of the pits after Pit Boost in the lead of that second group, and it was tight, but I was able to hang on there, and that’s what made the race.It meant that we could do the Attack Modes later, which was really powerful.”Nick Cassidy also shared a video montage of his podium celebration, where he sprayed champagne and celebrated with his team and family. He wrote, “Parked it in Victory Lane in London! That was incredibly special and will take a while to sink in.

Kush Maini is a pro when it comes to cricket knowledge

Who is Kush Maini?

Mahindra Racing’s Indian Formula 2 champion Kush Maini is not just an impressive presence on the track but also well-versed in his country’s favourite sport — cricket. The racer from Bengaluru recently took a cricket quiz and nearly scored a perfect 10/10, answering almost every question with precision. He is the only Indian to have won a Formula 2 race in Monaco and recently delivered an impressive performance at the Berlin Rookie Test, finishing among the top three in both sessions.A video of Kush Maini’s cricket quiz shows him getting momentarily confused with the first question, though he gave the correct answer initially. When asked about the number of players in a cricket team, he initially said “eleven” but changed it to “twelve” after counting the number of openers and following players.After that brief hiccup, Maini breezed through the quiz like a pro. He correctly answered questions about the criteria for a four and a six, and explained terms like LBW, duck, and clean bowled. He also knew the number of overs bowled in T20, One-Day, and Test matches.When asked which team Virat Kohli represents in the IPL, Maini confidently replied, “RCB… that’s me, can’t get that wrong.” He also tackled a question about the British singer who joked about not understanding cricket despite coming from the country that invented it.Maini answered “Ed Sheeran” — and was pleasantly surprised to learn he was right. He also knew that David Beckham was the English footballer who once played a friendly match with Sachin Tendulkar.Watch Kush Maini’s candid video here Kush Maini moved to England at the age of 13–14 to pursue racing. Originally from Bengaluru, he now spends more time abroad than in India. He became the first Indian to win the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix in Formula 2 earlier this year.He recently showcased his racing talent during the Berlin Rookie Test, representing Mahindra Racing. He finished second in the morning session and third in the afternoon. Speaking after the test, he said, “In the morning, we focused on 350kW runs, and in the afternoon, more on race runs. Whatever the run, we were always in the top three and really fast, so a good step was made. Whenever I get into this car, I leave with a smile on my face. ”Also Read: Berlin Rookie Test standouts Gabriele Minì and Kush Maini share insights after impressive runs Maini continues to shine on the track and, following his impressive performance in Berlin, may even join Formula E one day.","Kush Maini is the only Indian to have won a Formula 2 race in Monaco.

Why Formula E deserves to continue



London E‑Prix: Saturday Hype & Backstage Buzz – Round 15, Season 11

FIA and Formula E comment on agreement extension



In good news for Formula E, a multi-year agreement extension has secured the rights to the FIA Formula E World Championship for an additional 10 years from 2038, when the current agreement ends. This ensures a long and thrilling future for the FIA Formula E World Championship. The long-term extension will enable Formula E to grow further, build strategic long-range partnerships, and drive greater fan engagement.At present, Formula E continues to focus on its phased development strategy for its racing cars — delivering faster top speeds, greater acceleration, enhanced aerodynamics, and improved tyre performance. These developments highlight the series' increased relevance to consumers and the wider EV market, with greater “race to road” technology transfer.With electric vehicle sales projected to rise to over 40% of global vehicle sales by 2030, and global lithium-ion battery production expected to triple by 2030, the relevance of Formula E and its technological advancements is more critical than ever. The Formula E GEN3 Evo already represents a step-change in performance: 0–60 mph in just 1.82 seconds (30% faster than a current Formula 1 car), a 200 mph top speed, and nearly 50% of the energy needed to complete a race regenerated during the event.It is designed with sustainability at its core and includes tyres made with 35% recycled materials and bodywork incorporating recycled carbon fibre and natural fibres.Formula E sees the participation of major automotive manufacturers including Porsche, Jaguar, Nissan, Maserati, Stellantis, Mahindra, and Lola-Yamaha. Since its first race in Beijing in 2014, Formula E has grown by 20% year-on-year, reaching around 400 million fans globally and attracting a television audience of approximately half a billion.The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the global governing body for motorsport and mobility organisations, has announced a multi-year extension to its agreement with Formula E Holdings Limited (majority-owned by Liberty Global).Mohammed Ben Sulayem, President at the FIA, said, “The extension of the agreement governing the FIA Formula E World Championship is a fantastic outcome for the sport and a clear reflection of our ongoing strategy at the FIA to foster long-term stability, innovation, and growth across all areas of motorsport.”He further said, “This milestone reaffirms our commitment to innovation, sustainability, and technological progress, which are all central to the Championship’s unique identity and purpose. It also aligns with our broader goal of increasing global participation and driving more accessible motorsport for all.

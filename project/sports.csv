NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh believes India will beat Pakistan in their T20 World Cup match, but he warned that India must handle Pakistan’s spinner Usman Tariq carefully. He said India should stay calm and confident during the game.""India will win the match. Pakistan has a spinner (Usman Tariq), he is a good spinner, we have to play him safely. The Indian team is capable; it is a very good team. We hope they play the way they have always played, play without any pressure and wave the flag of victory,"" Harbhajan told the media.Usman Tariq has been doing very well in T20 matches, taking many wickets at a low average. However, his bowling action has caused controversy, with some people questioning if it is legal.Another former Indian player, Nayan Mongia , also feels confident about India winning.He said, ""It will be fun. We hope it will be a good match and India wins. Because the way India is performing, the way they are batting, bowling, the captain leading from the front and this game is all about confidence and Pakistan has lost ICC tournaments seven or eight times in a row.""I don't think there is going to be much difficulty because there will be a lot of pressure on Pakistan...Cricket has changed a lot. The youngsters of India have become fearless. An over, a four or a six could change the game.""Mongia also expects Hardik Pandya to perform well, especially under pressure.

T20 World Cup | Ishan Kishan press conference: On fifty vs Namibia, India's batting collapses

After a historic ICC Under-19 World Cup 2026 campaign, where his blistering 175 powered India to a record-extending sixth title, young batting sensation Vaibhav Sooryavanshi is set to swap cricket whites for school uniform as he prepares to appear for his Class 10 board examinations — stepping briefly away from the spotlight to embrace student life.Neel Kishore, principal of Podar International School, Samastipur, confirmed that the 14-year-old will soon take guard on the “academic pitch”, stressing that he will receive no special treatment despite his cricketing fame.""Cricketer Vaibhav Sooryavanshi will appear for the Class 10th board exams at our school. He has received his admit card. There is excitement among everyone, be it teachers, students or parents, for his arrival. However, we have made arrangements with that in mind, as he is still a student and will be appearing for his examination. This is an academic pitch, not a cricket pitch. We will ensure students have no issues taking the exams. All the facilities, safety, and security will be the same for all. Exams will start on February 17,"" Neel told ANI.Sooryavanshi saved his best for the U19 World Cup final against England in Harare, smashing 175 off just 80 balls, including 15 fours and 15 sixes — the most sixes in a single U19 World Cup innings.He finished as the second-highest run-getter of the tournament with 439 runs in seven matches at an average of 62.71 and a strike rate of 169.49, registering a century and three fifties.He also set a new benchmark for power-hitting, hammering a record 30 sixes in the tournament — eclipsing Dewald Brevis’ tally of 18 in the 2022 edition — and now holds the record for the most sixes in U19 World Cup history.In U19 ODIs overall, Sooryavanshi is India’s leading run-scorer, amassing 1,412 runs in 25 innings at an average of 56.48 and a strike rate above 165, including four centuries and seven fifties, with a highest score of 175.His meteoric rise began in October 2024 when he struck a 58-ball century against Australia U19 in Chennai — the fastest by an Indian batter in Youth Tests. Soon after, he made headlines at the IPL 2025 mega auction, securing a Rs 1.1 crore deal with Rajasthan Royals and becoming the youngest player in IPL history.In an IPL clash against Gujarat Titans, the 14-year-old created more records, becoming the youngest T20 centurion and the first Indian to register the fastest IPL fifty. Announcing himself with a first-ball six in the league, he finished the season with 252 runs in seven innings at an average of 36.00 and a staggering strike rate of 206.55, including a century and a fifty.His exploits continued across formats — from a 52-ball century that made him the youngest and fastest U19 centurion, to a 61-ball 108 in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy that made him the youngest centurion in the tournament’s history, and an 84-ball 190 in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, where he became the youngest List A centurion and the second-fastest Indian to reach the milestone.While his aggressive, high-risk approach can sometimes lead to off-days, it is equally breathtaking when it clicks — the ball flying off his bat to all corners as he continues to take every format by storm.","Vaibhav Sooryavanshi is set to appear for his Class 10 board examinations.

T20 World Cup | Ishan Kishan press conference: On fifty vs Namibia, India's batting collapses

Following his match-winning knock against Namibia in the ICC T20 World Cup clash in Delhi, Indian wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan opened up about the advice he received from all-rounder Hardik Pandya after losing his BCCI central contract in 2024. Kishan revealed how Hardik urged him not to dwell on the setback but to make the most of every opportunity in domestic cricket.Kishan’s explosive 24-ball 61, along with Hardik’s blazing 28-ball 52 and two wickets, powered India to a commanding 93-run win over Namibia. After the game, the two shared a light-hearted conversation about their performances and the tough phase Kishan endured following the loss of his contract over alleged lack of commitment to red-ball and domestic cricket.Interestingly, Hardik himself was navigating a challenging period in early 2024. After returning to Mumbai Indians from Gujarat Titans — where he had led the side to an IPL title — he was appointed MI captain. The decision triggered heavy backlash from sections of fans loyal to former skipper Rohit Sharma, with loud boos and criticism greeting Hardik at several venues.During this period, Hardik and Ishan spent considerable time together, bonding and training extensively. Determined to respond with performances, Kishan piled on the runs in domestic cricket.He began with a century for India-C in the Duleep Trophy, followed by 38 in the Irani Cup. In the 2024-25 Ranji Trophy season, he struck a century for Jharkhand. He also impressed in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and Vijay Hazare Trophy, scoring 316 runs in seven matches in the latter at an average of over 45 and a strike rate exceeding 128, including a hundred.Kishan carried that momentum into the IPL, scoring 354 runs in his debut season with Sunrisers Hyderabad, including a century against Rajasthan Royals. A stint with Nottinghamshire in County cricket saw him register two fifties. He then led Jharkhand to their maiden SMAT title, topping the charts with 517 runs in 10 innings, including two centuries and two fifties. A breathtaking 39-ball 125 in the Vijay Hazare Trophy against Karnataka further strengthened his case for national selection.His return to India’s T20I squad against New Zealand proved fruitful, as he emerged as the second-highest run-getter with 215 runs at an average of 53.75 and a strike rate of over 231, including a century and a fifty. Notably, there was marked improvement in his off-side play and six-hitting ability.When he brought up his maiden T20I century against New Zealand in Kerala, Hardik was at the non-striker’s end, sharing an emotional hug as Kishan reached the milestone.Reflecting on his time away, Kishan said that although he is “not the kind of person to stay quiet”, Hardik advised him to let his bat do the talking.""I am usually not the kind of person who will keep quiet, but because I was in touch with him and he was like, 'It's up to you whether you want to talk to somebody about it or go negative about it. It is in your hand'. And that was playing cricket and scoring runs. And doing well in whichever tournaments I was playing in. Credit also goes to him (for helping him in his India comeback),"" said Kishan.Hardik, meanwhile, recalled Kishan’s century against the Kiwis with pride, highlighting the journey they have shared.""The rhythm in which you smashed it, the way the ball left your bat, I was extremely happy. For the last two years, you have worked really hard behind the scenes, kept quiet. Even when the opportunity did not come, you were still smiling, keeping the spirit high and working hard,"" said Hardik.""Hard work is supposed to happen when no one is watching. And that is the actual benefit. No matter what happens in life, do not be a crybaby. Get up in the morning, work hard, put your head down and sleep. Again, repeat it. He has taken the torch, responded with the bat, and I am really proud of it,"" the all-rounder concluded.",Ishan Kishan and Hardik Pandya share light-hearted conversation after T20 World Cup. KISHan reveals advice he received from Hardik after losing BCCI central contract in 2024.

NEW DELHI: The scoreboard does not tell you the full story. It rarely does. It will say UAE chased down 151 for a five-wicket victory, that Sohaib Khan made 51 off 29 balls, that Aryansh Sharma played a match-winning, unbeaten knock of 74, and that Canada were left stunned at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on a Friday night in February 2026.But will the scoreboard tell anything about the evolution of a boy from Bihar , now the man for UAE on the world stage?There was a hush in the UAE dugout when the score stood at 66/4 in a chase of 151.Harshit Kaushik had just walked back, and what looked like a comfortable pursuit had started to wobble.Aryansh Sharma, on 44, stood like a lighthouse at one end. But he needed a partner. Someone with the nerve to walk into a collapsing chase and absorb pressure.Enter Sohaib Khan. After showing poise at the beginning, he started showing his true colours.Against Dilon Heyliger, he smashed 17 runs in the 17th over, then added 13 more off Jaskaran Singh in the next.When Sohaib finally fell after amassing 51 off 29 balls, thanks to four 4s and four 6s, the scores were tied. His departure felt like a footnote. The job was done.“Before me and Aryansh, I will give a lot of credit to our coach, Lalchand Rajput and the entire management.When I was going to bat, they were saying only one thing, 'just believe in yourself, this is the time, and you can do it,'” Sohaib told reporters in the post-match press conference.On Friday evening, the strategy was simple as he added, “We were requiring only 12 runs per over. As MS Dhoni would say, when you are on the field in a pressure game, just back your technique and be calm, so I was thinking the same.”Born in Bihar, Sohaib spent a significant part of his early life in Gaya. There, he would play tennis-ball cricket. It was long before he encountered professional structures.“I was born in Bihar and spent a lot of time in Bihar’s Gaya district,"" said the 27-year-old batter. ""I started playing professional cricket very late in 2014. But before that, this situation used to come in tennis cricket, when we used to play red tennis there.”The “situation” he refers to, that of a pressure chase, has been his cricketing classroom. While Bihar planted the seed of his urge for cricket, New Delhi helped it grow.“I started my cricketing journey from Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, and as I said, this was my home where I started professionally,” Sohaib added.Completing his bachelor's in Sociology from Jamia, he played there for three to four years between 2014 and 2019, turning out in North Zone tournaments in 2017 and 2018.Then life intervened, and opportunities dried up. COVID struck. And after that, he got married in 2021.“Honestly speaking, this is beyond a game,” he continued. “I moved to UAE during the time of COVID in November 2021, as we were not able to get opportunities here. I got married in 2021.”Life was tiring but not without cricket. By day, he worked as a financial consultant and salesperson. By night, he would hone his cricketing skills under floodlights.“In UAE, there is this cricket infrastructure that we can play cricket at night and do our job in the morning. So, it helped a lot,” he added.“My daughter and my wife were there, my parents were there (today) in the stadium, so I thought this is the game, where I can do my best. No matter how much I have struggled in the last 4-5 years, if this phase happens, it is fine, what else can I ask from God?” he smiled.Friday’s innings will leave a mark on the memories of the cricket fanatics that a boy from Gaya can become a hero for the UAE. A financial consultant can become a World Cup match-winner. A late bloomer can bloom on the biggest stage.","UAE beat Canada by five wickets in T20 World Cup match on Friday. Sohaib Khan scored 51 off 29 balls in chase of 151. The 27-year-old was born in Bihar and moved to New Delhi in 2021.

Poll Do you think Abhishek Sharma will be fit to play against Pakistan? Yes, he will be fit No, he won't be ready

NEW DELHI: India’s preparations for the high-voltage T20 World Cup clash against Pakistan have been dominated by one burning question — will Abhishek Sharma be fit in time? Conflicting updates from teammates and captain have only added to the intrigue ahead of Sunday’s marquee encounter.Spinner Varun Chakravarthy struck an optimistic note after India’s win over Namibia, revealing that the explosive opener could be on track for a comeback. “As far as I have spoken to him he looks good, he did some practice today also. He told me he is on the way,” Varun said, hinting at a possible return.However, skipper Suryakumar Yadav painted a more cautious picture. Abhishek, who was hospitalised earlier this week with a stomach infection, is still regaining strength after being discharged. “Abhishek isn’t fine still, might take one or two games,” Surya admitted, suggesting the team would prioritise his full recovery.The attacking left-hander missed the Namibia clash, where Sanju Samson partnered Ishan Kishan at the top of the order. Even as the team trained at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, Abhishek did not join full sessions, with reports indicating weakness and slight weight loss following the illness.Team management is expected to make a final call after monitoring his workload during training in Colombo. Traditionally, Abhishek spends long hours batting in nets and that endurance test could determine whether he is ready for the pressure of an India-Pakistan showdown.For now, India appear caught between hope and caution: Varun’s upbeat “he is on the way” versus Suryakumar’s realistic “might take one or two games” assessment.",India face Pakistan in their opening T20 World Cup match on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Rohit Sharma has warned Team India not to take their high-profile T20 World Cup 2026 clash against Pakistan lightly, even though they are favourites on paper.India face Pakistan on February 15 at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, and Rohit believes past records or rankings won’t matter once the match starts.India have dominated Pakistan in T20 World Cups and recent T20Is, but Rohit stressed that cricket can be unpredictable and every team can win on its day.Speaking at an event in Dubai, he said, “Firstly I never believed in this word called favourites. It’s such a funny game, and we’ve seen it now there’s so much that has happened in this last 10 years of international cricket. All these teams have so much exposure now playing T20 cricket.""You can’t just go and think that it’s a two-point victory for us. You just have to play good cricket on that particular day to achieve those points otherwise you might end up going home without anything.”He added that current form, reputation or history won’t guarantee success.According to Rohit, the key is performing on the day of the match, because any team can beat another in T20 cricket.“So it’s not about what you’ve done in the past, what is your team like, players are in form or not form. You just have to play well on that particular day because every team is capable of beating any team on that particular day,” he said.India have lost only once to Pakistan in World Cups, in the 2021 T20 World Cup, and have beaten them in their last five T20I meetings.",Former India captain Rohit Sharma warns Team India not to take Pakistan lightly.

Poll How confident are you in India's ability to handle Usman Tariq's spin bowling? Very Confident Somewhat Confident Not Confident

NEW DELHI: India’s preparations for the high-voltage T20 World Cup clash against Pakistan have taken a clear tactical direction, with wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan insisting that the team is already equipped to tackle the unique challenge posed by spinner Usman Tariq . Fresh off a commanding win over Namibia, Kishan revealed that facing Namibia skipper Gerhard Erasmus — who also bowls with a sidearm action — offered valuable rehearsal ahead of the much-anticipated showdown.Kishan’s explosive 24-ball 61 laid the foundation for India’s imposing 209/9, ensuring momentum even during a middle-overs slowdown. Speaking after the match, the left-hander emphasised that India’s batters have already completed their homework against Tariq’s unconventional action.“No, I think we have already done the preparation part, and now it is just time to watch the ball and play our natural game,” he said, underlining the team’s belief in sticking to basics despite the hype around the Pakistani spinner.According to Kishan, video analysis and on-field exposure to Erasmus’ bowling proved crucial. “At this level, we just watch a few videos, and we get an idea of what kind of bowling is going to happen. So we are just keeping it simple. Yeah, he [Erasmus] bowled pretty well today, and I think there was quite a bit of learning for us,” he added, suggesting that India’s approach will revolve around clarity rather than overthinking.Reflecting on the Namibia clash, Kishan explained that although the surface looked flat, the ball initially held up, forcing him and Sanju Samson to pick their moments carefully. The attacking opener’s knock, combined with Hardik Pandya ’s blazing fifty, powered India to a total that proved far beyond Namibia’s reach as spinners later dismantled the chase.Kishan also spoke candidly about his personal evolution after leading Jharkhand to a maiden Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy triumph. “I think I am a changed man now… earlier I used to joke around 24x7, but now it is just two-three hours. I am focusing more on batting and my wicket-keeping,” he admitted, highlighting a more disciplined mindset.Looking ahead to the Pakistan encounter, Kishan acknowledged the magnitude of the occasion but stressed that preparation remains process-driven. “Pakistan clash, obviously, it would be a special one for everyone… once we get there, we look at the wicket and just play accordingly,” he said.",Wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan insists India are already equipped to tackle spinner Usman Tariq.

T20 World Cup | Jonathan Trott press conference after loss vs South Africa

Poll Do you think Afghanistan can learn from this Super Over defeat? Absolutely! Maybe, but it will take time No, it's too demoralizing Not sure

There are some defeats that can crush you. For Afghanistan, it was one such afternoon in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.The double Super Over loss to South Africa, that has all but ended the team’s T20 World Cup campaign, may seem the end of the world for now. But Afghanistan should take heart from the fact that it was their famed fighting spirit, so intrinsic to their cricket, that kept them in the game against all odds.It’s not that Afghanistan haven’t endured heartbreaking losses before. The 2023 ODI World Cup defeat to Australia following Glenn Maxwell’s superheroics at the Wankhede probably cost them a place in the semifinals. The 2024 T20 World Cup semifinal defeat to South Africa was more sobering, but in this defeat, there was hardly anything that the Afghans could have done differently. Maybe just one thing — their choice of bowler in at least one of the Super Overs. Rashid Khan, their talisman for years and still considered one of the best in T20 cricket, chose to intriguingly keep himself away from the action.Rashid is somebody who used to bowl in the Powerplay for fun. However, in both losses in this World Cup, the superstar didn’t bowl in the first six overs. His decision to avoid the pressure cooker of a Super Over was slightly baffling, more so since South Africa opted for Keshav Maharaj in the second Super Over.Rashid, who has presented Afghanistan with many memorable moments, wasn’t asked why he kept himself away. Nor was coach Jonathan Trott made to face the question, but it remains to be asked, is Rashid still the bowler he used to be?The question is pertinent because the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad is a ground that the bowler knows like the back of his palm. Rashid plays for Gujarat Titans in the IPL and has immense experience of Indian conditions. He took 2-28 during the South African chase and was Afghanistan’s most economical bowler during the 20 overs. And most importantly, no other bowler in his team generates the fear factor that he does.Yet Azmatullah Omarzai was asked to bowl the second Super Over and the 24 the medium-pacer conceded really made the task immensely difficult. But one player who still made a fight out of it was Rahmanullah Gurbaz.The three sixes that Gurbaz hit off Maharaj showed his strength of character as it followed his 42-ball 84 during Afghanistan’s chase.The 24-year-old has been the lynchpin of the Afghan batting lineup for a while now.Coach Trott felt that the kind of talent Gurbaz has, he should come up with more such performances.“It’s probably the best innings I’ve seen him play and it’s unfortunate he couldn’t get us over the line. With the amount of talent, physique, sporting ability and natural hand-eye coordination that he has, it’s about going forward for him now.“He wears his heart on his sleeve and over the years, I have just tried to get him to be a little more consistent in everything that he does,” Trott said.With time, it will be interesting to see if Gurbaz gets more responsibility, taking the baton from Rashid and turning Afghanistan into a team that deals with the crunch moments a little bit better.","Afghanistan lost to South Africa in the T20 World Cup quarter-final in Ahmedabad.

45/1 to 77/6 against the USA. 205/4 to 209/9 against Namibia.India won their first two T20 World Cup contests rather convincingly but two batting collapses, occurring at different junctures of the game, should serve as a wake-up call for the batters ahead of the game against Pakistan on February 15 in Colombo.In both matches, the word from the Indian camp remained constant. They expected the wicket to be flatter and behave a certain way but the sluggishness in Mumbai and the odd low bounce in Delhi caught them off guard. Colombo is expected to be no different and will require a lot of adaptation and unlearning for a destructive batting unit which has feasted on batting paradises in the bilateral fixtures which preceded the multi-nation tournament.The sample size isn't that big but both Shadley van Schalkwyk and Gerhard Erasmus have provided a blueprint to the remaining teams. If you must stop this marauding Indian unit, be tactically smart: mix up your approach and have different plans ready.This Indian XI boasts of as many as five, even six when Abhishek Sharma played the first game, left-handers in the top-eight but they are all different. What works for Ishan Kishan may not work for Abhishek and a similar plan will not get the job done for the likes of Tilak Varma, Shivam Dube, Rinku Singh and Axar Patel.From their approach to hitting arcs to technicalities, there is very little similarity, which makes it all the more important to have clear and precise plans for each one.Schalkwyk mixed up his bumpers based on advice from his USA teammates and Erasmus was very smart in using angles, different release points and the crease. The delivery which got Tilak Varma took forever to reach the India batter because the bowler released it from far behind the crease. Even the step-out didn't achieve the desired connection. Namibia coach Craig Williams praised his skipper, lauding his ability to deliver the toughest overs of an innings.""He trains incredibly hard at all these variations, and I think - he plays cricket around the world in some leagues and bowls all the difficult overs, he bowls some really tough overs. And, he's continuously working on his game and trying to see how he can be more effective against batters. And I think tonight, again, against a world-class cricket team, he showed the world again what he's got and his execution was just really good tonight.""I think his first three overs went for 16 or something and then to bowl that 19th over as all under pressure - first ball going for six and then pulling it back, I think it was just really fantastic so I'm really happy for him he trains hard and he works hard at these variations in his game,"" said Williams at the post-match press conference.Erasmus certainly came prepared. While the occasional sling in the action can disrupt a batter's concentration, Ishan felt it only takes a couple of balls to get used to it and clear it from one's mind. Does it affect the plans to go big? Not really!""It might play in your head for a couple of balls, but I think at this level you need to have trust on your own strength as well. Even if he is trying to do something, we can go for sixes or boundaries at the same time. So important thing is how we are thinking at that point of time when the bowler is trying to do something different. But if we are just looking for boundaries and sixes and we are believing in our own strength I think that helps the batters more so we are just doing trying to keep it simple yeah some batters might score on, some batters won't but it's part of game and you keep on learning game by game,"" said Kishan.India were set for another big total vs Namibia but ran out of steam in the last two overs, losing five wickets and added just four runs off the ten deliveries they faced. The set pair of Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube departed off consecutive balls, Axar Patel didn't score, and the ending starkly contrasted the explosive start Ishan and Sanju Samson provided.Ishan echoed the team's sentiment on the pitch but felt the unit fared well with the bat and appreciated the opposition for executing their plans under pressure. The wicketkeeper-batter expects his side to take learnings from this fixture into the remaining games of the tournament.""I think they batted pretty well. In both the wickets, I feel it was a bit different from what we expected to happen. And today, looking at the death overs, when we were not able to regularly hit big sixes, I think we need to also give credit to Namibia bowlers because they were bang on with their yorkers, they were bang on with their slow ones.""So yeah it was a good learning maybe if some other team is doing the same thing maybe we can use the crease more or we can do something different which can irritate the bowler. So it was a good learning in this game and especially I think It was not about our batters not able to hit sixes, but it was more of them bowling very well in the death overs,"" explained Ishan.The USA had India on the mat, Namibia had their moments and an immediate course correction with the bat is needed to cover all bases against a spin-heavy Pakistan, who have already experienced the Colombo strip.The Suryakumar Yadav-led unit has bludgeoned attacks in the build-up to the World Cup but what worked yesterday may not work today and tomorrow is always a dive into the unknown. The muscle memory of tonking bowlers on flat pitches will need a quick unlearn as Colombo, and remainder of the tournament, may not follow the script everyone is so used to seeing played on loop.India's remaining opponents would surely have noted the cracks that both the USA and Namibia exposed.","India won their first two T20 World Cup contests rather convincingly.

200-plus totals for India in T20WC

NEW DELHI: India once again underlined why they are regarded as the most destructive batting unit in the shortest format, riding on blistering half-centuries from Ishan Kishan and Hardik Pandya to post a formidable 209/9 against Namibia in their Group A clash of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Thursday.Kishan set the tone with a breathtaking 61 off just 24 deliveries, mixing brute force with clean timing as he dismantled Namibia’s pace attack in the powerplay. His innings, studded with crisp boundaries and towering sixes, powered India to a staggering 104/1 in just seven overs. Pandya then took over the mantle, striking a muscular 52 off 28 balls, ensuring India maintained momentum despite losing wickets at regular intervals later in the innings.Namibia, however, found a way to pull things back through their skipper Gerhard Erasmus, who delivered a remarkable spell of unorthodox slingy bowling. Erasmus finished with career-best figures of 4/20, using variations and subtle changes in pace to choke the Indian batters on a surface that offered some grip to the spinners. Alongside Bernard Scholtz, Erasmus applied the brakes through the middle overs, forcing India into errors as they attempted to sustain the scoring rate.Although Pandya staged a late counter-attack to bring up his half-century, India lost five wickets in the final two overs, allowing Namibia to claw back some respectability. From a position where India looked set to breach 220 comfortably, Namibia would take heart from restricting the damage to just over 200.With this innings, India extended their tally of 200-plus scores in Men’s T20 Internationals to 47 — the most by any team. South Africa trail with 29 such totals, followed by New Zealand (28), while Australia and West Indies are joint fourth with 25 each.India’s recent scoring spree has been even more emphatic. Since the T20 World Cup 2024, they have registered 14 totals of 200 or more in T20Is, double the number managed by any other side in the same period. The consistency highlights the depth and fearlessness of India’s batting approach.In T20 World Cup history too, India’s ability to cross the 200-run mark has been a recurring theme. Their notable tallies include 218/4 against England in Durban in 2007, 210/2 versus Afghanistan in Abu Dhabi in 2021, 205/5 against Australia in Gros Islet in 2024, and now 209/9 against Namibia in Delhi in 2026.47 - India29 - South Africa28 - New Zealand25 - Australia25 - West Indies218/4 vs ENG, Durban, 2007210/2 vs AFG, Abu Dhabi, 2021209/9 vs NAM, Delhi, 2026205/5 vs AUS, Gros Islet, 2024","India posted 209/9 against Namibia in their Group A clash of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Thursday.

What will be India’s playing XI against Pakistan?

This T20 World Cup has teased with near upsets, with lesser-fancied teams pushing heavyweights to the brink. On Friday, the underdog went one better.It was supposed to be a familiar script, Australia the colossus, Zimbabwe the understudy. But under Colombo’s humid skies, where the air hung heavy and the pitch gripped, Zimbabwe defied the odds to stun Australia by 23 runs.Zimbabwe fought, contested every run, defended every inch. In the deep, they clung onto screamers, turning half opportunities into match-altering moments and it resulted in their second win over the Australians in T20 World Cup history. The first was in the inaugural edition in South Africa.For the former champions, depleted by a groin injury to captain Mitchell Marsh, and unavailability of bowlers Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, Australia found themselves under pressure after losing early wickets while chasing 170, eventually folding for 146.Zimbabwe controlled the tempo, dictated the terms, and didn’t try to blast the doors open. Batting first, their 169/2 was a masterclass in tempo. Wickets were preserved through the sticky middle overs.Zimbabwe’s innings moved with a patient pulse, waiting for the bowlers to blink. When the moment arrived, they detonated with precision.Set up by a polished, unbeaten 56-ball 64 from opener Brian Bennett, Zimbabwe blended aggression with calculated acceleration. Bennett’s partner Tadiwanashe Marumani set the tone, cracking 35 off 21 in a lively opening stand of 61. Ryan Burl matched Bennett stroke for stroke during a 70-run partnership for the second wicket, contributing a fluent 35 before holding out to Cameron Green in the 16th over.Captain Sikandar Raza delivered the late thrust with an unbeaten 25 from 13 which lifted Zimbabwe to a match-winning total.For Australia, the slide began early. Pacer Blessing Muzarabani struck in his first over, removing Josh Inglis and also accounted for Tim David inside the Powerplay. Brad Evans proved an ideal foil, accounting for Cameron Green and stand-in captain Travis Head. Australia were reeling at 29/4 in five overs.Glenn Maxwell attempted a rebuild but never found fluency, grinding to 31 off 32 before Burl bowled him. Matt Renshaw counterpunched with a spirited 65 from 44 balls, briefly reviving hopes. But Muzarabani returned to extinguish embers of a possible Aussie fightback. His 4/17, a career-best bowling display and Brad Evans’ three-wicket burst ensured there was no late twist.Zimbabwe fielded like their lives were dependent on it. A stunning catch in the deep by Tony Munyonga to dismiss Ben Dwarshuis showcased Zimbabwe’s intent.",Zimbabwe beat Australia by 23 runs in T20 World Cup. Brian Bennett top scored for Zimbabwe with 64 runs. Australia were chasing 170 to win. Blessing Muzarabani took four wickets for Zimbabwe.

Why India need to be worried about Pakistan in Colombo | T20 World Cup

The surface at the R Premadasa Stadium has brought spin into focus ahead of Sunday’s India-Pakistan clash, especially after Zimbabwe’s bowlers used variations to beat Australia in the previous match. Conditions at the venue, also known as Khettarama, could once again shape the contest.On a slow, newly prepared pitch, Zimbabwe’s pacers relied on change of pace to restrict Australia and defend 169, winning by 23 runs. That performance has raised interest around how spinners from both sides could operate on a similar track.India’s Varun Chakravarthy, along with Pakistan’s Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq , are expected to play key roles in the high-stakes India-Pakistan match.Chakravarthy adjusted his method during last year’s Indian Premier League, moving from sidespin to overspin, focusing more on angles than sharp turn. He also bowls quicker than many spinners, averaging around 95 kmph, though the surface here may require a reduction in pace.""At such speeds and angles, length is more important. Varun has an ideal length. It’s neither too short nor too full, so the batsmen cannot hang back comfortably and pull or come out confidently to play those big shots.He can create a lot of doubts in batsmen’s mind with his lengths,"" former India spinner Sunil Joshi explained, as cited by news agency PTI.Chakravarthy’s approach could test Babar Azam, who now bats at No. 4. Babar has often taken time to settle in T20 cricket, including in the previous game against USA where he took 20 balls to hit his first six. Against a bowler who rarely offers loose deliveries, that approach may come under pressure.Pakistan, however, have an option in Usman Tariq, whose pause-and-release action has drawn attention. His method has been compared in style to former Sri Lanka pacer Lasith Malinga because of the sling-like release.“His action, the primary attraction of his bowling, allows him to keep the ball below the batsmen’s eye line. So, it’s not easy to hit him, it is almost like you are dealing with yorkers every ball.""But more than that, Tariq is a mature person, who understands his game and reads the batsmen well. He has come through some struggles. The whole action and mystery just add to his personality,” Nabeel Hashmi, General Manager of Quetta Gladiators, Tariq’s Pakistan Super League team, was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Abrar Ahmed has faced Indian batters before, but the surface could still aid his style. He depends largely on googlies and carrom balls, with 34 of his 49 T20I wickets coming from those variations. Rather than looping the ball, he targets the stumps and relies on accuracy to create pressure.","Varun Chakravarthy, Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq expected to play key roles in India-Pakistan match. Zimbabwe's bowlers used variations to beat Australia in the previous match.

The United States secured a 93-run win over the Netherlands in a group-stage match of the T20 World Cup on Friday, riding on Saiteja Mukkamalla’s 79 and a four-wicket spell from former India U-19 cricketer Harmeet Singh. It was USA’s first T20I victory against the Netherlands.Mukkamalla’s 51-ball 79 anchored the innings as USA posted 196 for 6 in 20 overs. Shubham Ranjane contributed 48 not out from 24 balls to push the total close to 200.In reply, the Netherlands were bowled out for 103 in 15.5 overs. Left-arm spinner Harmeet Singh returned figures of 4 for 21, the best by a USA bowler in a T20 World Cup match.Harmeet did not extract sharp turn but benefited from errors by the batters. Opener Max O'Dowd (13) and all-rounder Bas de Leede (23) were dismissed off short deliveries that were hit to fielders. He also bowled a flat delivery that beat captain Scott Edwards and another straight ball that trapped Roelof de Merwe lbw.Left-arm spinner Nosthush Kenjige accounted for Michael Levitt with a ball that stayed low.Chasing on a surface that slowed as the match progressed, the Netherlands did not build partnerships and fell well short of the target.Earlier, Mukkamalla set the platform with his 79. He shared a 55-run stand for the second wicket with captain Monank Patel (36) and added 54 for the fourth wicket with Ranjane.Mukkamalla, who trained at the academy run by VVS Laxman in Hyderabad, struck five fours and four sixes. He scored freely through the off side, including shots over cover.Ranjane attacked in the closing overs and handled the short-ball approach used by the Netherlands bowlers. He hit Roelof van der Merwe for a straight six and pulled both Bas de Leede and Logan van Beek.At one stage, with Mukkamalla and Ranjane at the crease, USA were positioned for a total beyond 200. However, van Beek and de Leede varied their pace on the Chepauk surface to restrict further damage.Bas de Leede, son of former Netherlands seamer Tim de Leede, finished with figures of 3 for 37.",United States secured a 93-run win over the Netherlands in a group-stage match of the T20 World Cup on Friday.

After months of uncertainty, administrative reshuffle and endless speculation, the Indian Super League is back in a leaner, shorter format and with everything to play for from day one.The new edition, delayed by nearly four months, will be held in a truncated format featuring 14 teams.With limited time remaining in the football calendar, the All India Football Federation has opted for a single round-robin format, scrapping the second leg and the traditional playoff stage.Each team will play 13 matches across a three-month league, and the side finishing on top of the table will be crowned champion.Defending champions and Kolkata giants Mohun Bagan Super Giant will kick off the season at home, hosting Kerala Blasters FC in the opening clash at 5pm at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.The fixture pits two of the largest fan bases in Indian football against each other and promises a high-voltage start to a season unlike any other.In the evening, newly-promoted Inter Kashi will be tested when they face Super Cup champions FC Goa in an away clash beginning 7.30pm.There will be no second chances, no knockouts but just 91 high-stakes matches where consistency alone will decide the champion.The season's launch comes as a major relief for participating clubs after months of uncertainty.The League itself had been hanging in the balance over the past few months after Football Sports Development Limited -- the Reliance-backed company that launched and ran the ISL since 2014 -- exited after its Master Rights Agreement with the AIFF ended.There was no immediate clarity on who would take charge, raising serious doubts about whether the season would even take place.Months of uncertainty finally eased only after the Union Sports Ministry intervened, helping the AIFF put a new arrangement in place and ensuring that the country's top-tier football competition could go ahead.However everything is not fully settled and there are several unanswered questions as several teams are still finalising their squads, and a few are expected to begin the season without foreign players.There has already been disruption before kickoff --the February 16 fixture between Odisha FC and Punjab FC has been put on hold as Odisha are yet to confirm their home venue.There was also confusion around the broadcast plans until late in the build-up.It has now been confirmed that all matches will be streamed on FanCode and telecast on Sony Sports Ten 2, according to an AIFF release.On the field, Mohun Bagan enter as favourites.The core of last season’s title-winning squad remains intact, and playing in front of their passionate supporters gives them an early edge.Head coach Sergio Lobera made it clear that excuses will not be entertained.""It will be a difficult season for everyone, but finally, this is the moment to try and find solutions and not find excuses,” he said.Forward Dimi Petratos struck a confident note: “We have the best squad in the country and we have trained well and we have come here to win.”The Blasters, however, have strengthened key areas with new foreign signings and believe they can spoil the party. Head coach David Català acknowledged the challenge but remained optimistic.“They are defending champions and best team in the country but in football everything is possible and one never knows what's going to happen. We are focused on tomorrow's game and we will try to get all three points,” he said.Goa, who have had competitive exposure this season, will look to use that rhythm to their advantage.Head coach Manolo Márquez expects a tight contest against the debutants.“My expectations are that it will be a difficult and a very equal game for both the teams,” he said.Inter Kashi, promoted after winning the I-League, arrive with ambition and belief.Head coach Antonio Habas emphasised the importance of making a strong first impression in their maiden ISL campaign.“It’s very important to create your first impression. We have to do really good in our first ISL season,” he said.",Mohun Bagan host Kerala Blasters in the opening match of the new Indian Super League season. Inter Kashi face Super Cup champions FC Goa in an away clash. The new season will be held in a truncated format featuring 14 teams.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128314868,imgsize-22888,width-400,resizemode-4/isl-logo-1302s.jpg"

England manager Thomas Tuchel signed a new contract on Thursday that will see him remain head coach of the team till the end of Euro 2028.The German was confirmed as the successor to Gareth Southgate in October 2024 and has overseen an unbeaten qualification run to this year's World Cup in North America, with England winning all eight group games.""I am very happy and proud to extend my time with England,"" said the 52-year-old former Chelsea manager in an FA statement.""It is no secret to anyone that I have loved every minute so far of working with my players and coaches, and I cannot wait to lead them to the World Cup.""It is an incredible opportunity and we are going to do our very best to make the country proud,"" added Tuchel, whose previous England deal ran only until the end of this year's global showpiece.The FA said that the new agreement with Tuchel would provide ""clarity and full focus"" amid speculation about his future after the World Cup.However, FA chief executive Mark Bullingham explained there are ""performance conditions"" in the deal.""We tend to want to know where we are, to remove that uncertainty when you're going into a tournament,"" added Bullingham. ""It gives everyone -- the support team and the players -- that certainty.""Tuchel had been touted as a candidate to be the next permanent Manchester United manager.But in signing a new England contract, Tuchel appears to have ruled himself out of a post-World Cup move to Old Trafford.The FA added that Tuchel's senior backroom team had all also agreed contract extensions through to the end of Euro 2028.""I have had so much support from Mark, all my colleagues at the FA and from fans wherever I go that I did not hesitate when asked to continue in this dream job,"" added Tuchel.- 'No better candidate' -Extending his contract ahead of this year's World Cup is a clear sign of the FA's confidence in Tuchel, who is aiming to guide the England men's team to their first major trophy in six decades.""He was the right person for the job when he joined us for the World Cup campaign, and has only strengthened his reputation across the qualifiers...There is simply no better candidate available in world football ,"" said Bullingham.Tuchel, due to attend the Nations League draw in Brussels on Thursday, said in his first interview after succeeding Southgate that he wanted to add a ""second star"" to the England shirt by winning the 2026 World Cup.The only major international tournament won by the England men's team was when they triumphed on home soil at the 1966 World Cup, defeating the then West Germany in a Wembley final.But they twice came close to ending that barren run under Southgate, losing in both the Euro 2020 and 2024 finals.Tuchel's England team eased through qualification, winning all eight matches in a group which also featured Albania, Serbia, Latvia and Andorra.They will face Croatia, Ghana and Panama in their World Cup group.But tougher tests could await in the knockout stages with co-hosts Mexico in line to face England on home ground in the last 16 should Tuchel's men top their group, with a possible quarter-final against five-time world champions Brazil to follow.",Thomas Tuchel signs new contract with England until end of Euro 2028.

'Unfair on both clubs': Bhutia

New Delhi: Churchill Brothers, who had provisionally finished top of the I-League standings last season and were slated to be promoted to the Indian Super League (ISL), will not be part of the top division in the 2025-26 season, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) ruled on Thursday.The decision was taken at the virtual Executive Committee meeting, just two days before the season begins. It was near-unanimously agreed that Churchill Brothers should not be part of the upcoming campaign, considering the preparations for the season were already underway.The Executive Committee meeting was initially set to take place on February 9 but was postponed after a quorum could not be reached.The decision also comes a day after majority of the ISL clubs had written to the AIFF and urged against including Churchill Brothers. They had argued, among multiple reasons, that the league's credibility would be questionable in that case.The situation arose after Churchill were declared provisional winners of the I-League. However, the title was taken away from them after second-placed Inter Kashi were awarded four points following a verdict by the Court of Arbitration of Sport (CAS).Inter Kashi were initially penalised by the AIFF Appeals Committee for fielding an ineligible player, a decision that was overturned after appeal to the sport's highest court.Subsequently, Inter Kashi were declared the I-League champions and promoted to the ISL. They will get their campaign underway away to FC Goa on February 14.Former India captain and current Executive Committee member Bhaichung Bhutia questioned the current 'inexperienced' administration for this mess. He also stated that with the courts deciding champions, it is not fair to either clubs.""Why have this meeting when the league is starting in five days time? That in itself shows the fault in the administration. And you're again having a meeting to decide whether they should be allowed or not! Secondly, why did the situation come here is created by the federation itself,"" said Bhutia, who is part of the 22-member Executive Committee.""They (Churchill Brothers) were completely right in appealing. They were declared winners and given the trophy. All said and done, it is unfair on both Inter Kashi and Churchill. Both the clubs were hard done by the federation and had to spend time, money and energy in going to court.""""When the league champion is decided by the court, either you decide both clubs should not play or you say that until the decision is finalised, we will not allow both to play. When it comes to allowing one and not the other, it becomes very unfair,"" he concluded.","Churchill Brothers will not be part of the Indian Super League in 2025-26.

Soham in action during a match.

Raised in a sports-loving family, Soham Bhagawati’s journey into football began at an early age. Born in Guwahati and raised in Dubai, he grew up surrounded by sporting influence: his father was a tennis player and his grandfather was a footballer. This unwavering family support helped turn a childhood passion into a serious career pursuit. Now based in Spain, the young footballer is steadily building his path towards a potential India debut.Soham moved to Spain about two and a half years ago to improve his football skills and gain exposure at a higher level. At the same time, he is continuing his studies and pursuing a degree in sports management, which helps him learn more about the sport both on and off the field.Soham was called up for trials with the India Under-19 team in 2020, a significant milestone in his career. He considers wearing the Indian jersey a major achievement and a moment of pride, further motivating him to push himself.The 22-year-old currently plays for Terrassa FC, representing the club’s B team in the second division of Catalonia, while the senior team competes in Spain’s fourth division.According to him, football in Spain has helped him grow both technically and mentally, and the competitive environment has been a valuable learning experience.Soham named Brazilian star Neymar as his early inspiration. However, with time and a deeper understanding of the game, he feels that every player brings something different to it. Today, rather than idolising one individual, Soham believes there is something to learn from everyone and focuses on improving by taking lessons from all players he watches and plays alongside.From Indian football, Soham calls Sunil Chhetri “the king” and draws inspiration from his achievements and leadership. He likes FC Barcelona and Argentina’s Boca Juniors, and he dreams of one day representing a club of similar stature through hard work and dedication.He hopes to represent his favourite ISL club, NorthEast United FC, one day. For now, however, his focus is on gaining experience and improving his game.According to Soham, the difference between players from India and Spain is not talent but exposure, which sets them apart. He, though, feels the level of young Indian footballers is steadily improving.""India has talented players and improving facilities, especially with ISL clubs now offering strong infrastructure. However, football does not receive the same level of investment and attention as other sports, which limits growth. Exposure to competitive environments is still the biggest gap,"" Soham told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.Soham emphasised how crucial the ISL is for Indian football. He said it not only provides young players with much-needed exposure and professional experience but also keeps fans connected to the sport.""The ISL is the main league people associate with football in India in recent years. Without it, the sport loses visibility and structure. Even though the format and wages have changed, it’s good that players are back on the field — playing matches is what matters most for footballers,"" he added.Soham’s short-term goal is to break into his club’s first team, while his long-term aim is to play at a higher professional level in Spain. Representing India at the senior level remains a clear dream — one he believes is achievable through consistent hard work, dedication and belief in his abilities.“Representing India at the senior level is everyone’s dream. For me, it could happen very soon if I keep working hard towards it. Let’s see — it takes effort, but if it happens, it will be a proud moment,” Soham added.Soham is optimistic about the future of Indian football. He believes that, with proper focus and commitment, India has the potential to qualify for the FIFA World Cup.“We already have top-quality players like Sandesh Jhingan, Lallianzuala Chhangte and many more. If we focus well and give everything to it, I believe we can achieve it in the next few years,” he said.Beyond football, Soham is deeply spiritual and credits his faith for keeping him grounded.“I always pray every day and look up to God because He is the one giving us opportunities. We’re truly blessed to have everything we have. There will be bad times, but they always pass. The key is to stay positive, focus on the right things, and always be happy and smile,” he said.",Soham Bhagawati was born in Guwahati and raised in Dubai.

Why is Ahmedabad likely to be the sporting capital of India? | Bombay Sport Exchange

Poll What do you think about FanCode's decision to partner with Sony Sports Network for ISL coverage? Excellent choice, strong market presence. Good, but could have considered other options. Disappointed, preferred a different network. No opinion.

Just over a week after FanCode, owned by Dream Sports, secured the broadcast rights for the truncated 2025–26 Indian Super League (ISL) season, it has sub-licensed the linear TV coverage to Culver Max Entertainment, also known as Sony Pictures Network India (SPNI).Sony Sports Network had attended the pre-bid conference but opted against making a final bid. FanCode eventually acquired the broadcast rights for Rs 8.62 crore.FanCode, which does not have a TV channel of its own, had entered into immediate conversations with multiple providers to showcase India's top division. Besides Sony Sports Network, Zee, DD Sports and regional providers in Kerala and Kolkata were the other considerations.However, the decision to go with Sony Sports was reached because they have an already established strong market base, while Zee is still finding its footing since re-entering the sports broadcast space last year. DD Sports was also probed as an option.While a verbal deal was reached between FanCode and Sony Sports Network, the paperwork and final agreement is in the closing stages at the time of writing.The contribution from Sony Sports will go to the All India Football Federation (AIFF), who are organising the league this season, and will be shared among the ISL clubs.Since acquiring the ISL broadcast rights, FanCode has announced separate structures for the fans to watch the ISL. There's a season pass for Rs 299, a team pass for Rs 149 and a match pass for Rs 25.With FanCode getting the media rights during the bidding process, KPS Studios will handle the world-feed production, acquired at a cost of Rs 5.22 crore.The 14-club league begins on February 14 with defending champions Mohun Bagan Super Giant taking on Kerala Blasters.","FanCode has sub-licensed the TV coverage of the 2025-26 ISL season to Sony Sports Network.

Russell Wilson mourns Naomi while reflecting on family, faith and 12 years of loyalty



Russell Wilson is mourning the loss of his Dalmatian Naomi, a companion who grew up alongside his NFL career and his young family. On Feb. 13, Russell Wilson, now quarterback of the New York Giants, shared the news on Instagram with two quiet photos that said more than any stat line ever could. One showed him smiling beside Naomi. The other captured her curled up with Prince, the family’s other Dalmatian who passed away last year.The post was simple and heartfelt. “Our sweet Naomi,” Wilson wrote. “Thank you for over 12 years of cuddles, kisses, and loyalty. You brought so much love to our family and gave us so many happy memories.” Then he added a line that carried both faith and longing: “You’re back with your soulmate Prince now in Doggy Heaven! We Love you always ❤️.”Naomi had been with Wilson since his first year in the league. She and Prince arrived when everything else in his life felt new and uncertain. Over time, they became part of the rhythm of his home with wife Ciara and their children, Sienna Princess, Win Harrison, Amora Princess and Future Zahir.The loss comes almost exactly a year after the family said goodbye to Prince following a long fight with cancer. In a January 2025 tribute, Wilson called him “a blessing to our family with so many memories, hugs and kisses from our 4 kids and us.”He wrote, “You will forever be a part of us. Today was a hard day. But you overcame cancer 2x and lived 12 years when most live 6. Heaven got a good one! Forever the Prince of Peace. Love you. ”Wilson has never treated his dogs as background details in his life. In a 2019 interview tied to the Banfield Foundation Safer Together initiative, he laughed about the chaos they brought into quiet moments. “The great Danes just want to lay on your lap all the time,” he said. “Ciara and I will be trying to have a date night, watching a movie, and all of a sudden there’s three great Danes laying across our laps.”Naomi’s passing adds to a history of goodbyes. In 2022, when Ciara introduced their puppy Bronco, she reflected on losing her longtime dog Tyson after nearly 17 years, calling it bittersweet and writing, “He will always be in our hearts.”For Wilson, the message feels clear. Trophies fade. Seasons pass. But the love waiting at home leaves a mark that stays.",Russell Wilson mourns the loss of his Dalmatian Naomi.

“Really messed up”: Indie artist accuses Taylor Swift of creative theft as Travis Kelce takes sudden podcast break,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/really-messed-up-indie-artist-accuses-taylor-swift-of-creative-theft-as-travis-kelce-takes-sudden-podcast-break/articleshow/128313704.cms,"Indie artist Gabi of the band Daffo has accused Taylor Swift of copying the concept of her 2025 “Quick Fix” music video for Swift’s recent “Opalite” release. Gabi claims both visuals share a 90s infomercial style built around a problem solving spray product. Swift has not responded. Meanwhile, Travis Kelce’s brief podcast hiatus has fueled fresh wedding speculation.

Indie artist details similarities between “Quick Fix” and “Opalite”

A Brooklyn-based indie-rock singer-songwriter has sparked a fresh debate around originality in pop music. Gabi, frontwoman of the band Daffo, publicly accused Taylor Swift of copying the concept of her 2025 music video shortly after Swift released visuals for her new track. The claim quickly gained traction online, with fans dissecting side by side clips and questioning where inspiration ends and imitation begins.The controversy arrives at a moment when Taylor Swift’s personal life is already under intense scrutiny. As Travis Kelce steps away from his podcast for a brief break, wedding rumors swirl. Now, a creative dispute adds another layer to an already dramatic news cycle surrounding the global pop star.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Gabi did not mince words when explaining why she believes her work was replicated. In a video statement, she said: ""So Taylor Swift copied my music video. I will show you clips in a second, but my name is Gabby, my band is called Dafoe, and in April of 2025 I released a music video for a song called Quick Fix.”She added, “The whole premise of the video is that there's this spray called Quick Fix that could fix all of your problems, and then we shot it in kind of like a 90s QVC commercial kind of way.And then a few days ago Taylor Swift released a music video for her song Opalite with the same concept.”She further added, “Obviously she was able to expand on the idea in ways that I couldn't because she has resources and money that I don't necessarily have access to, but more or less it looks like a complete riff to me, of the concept at least. Anyway, I think it's really messed up. It does not feel good.""""She's gonna make a lot of money off of an idea that probably wasn't hers. Yeah, here are the clips and pictures and stuff that I put together, but I really feel like you have to watch the videos to see the similarities.""Taylor Swift has not responded publicly. Meanwhile, Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce recently announced a “short little break” from their podcast, New Heights. The pause has fueled speculation that Swift and Kelce may be planning a wedding, though neither has confirmed anything.For now, fans are left debating two questions at once.

Super Bowl LX halftime show sparks tribute and backlash as Bad Bunny and TPUSA take divergent stages

TPUSA Presents: The ALL-AMERICAN HALFTIME SHOW

Super Bowl LX delivered more than touchdowns. It delivered a cultural split that played out in real time, both inside Levi’s Stadium and across millions of screens. While Bad Bunny made history as the first solo Latin artist to headline the halftime show, an alternate broadcast backed by Turning Point USA offered a very different soundtrack. The night quickly became about more than music.At the center of the counterprogramming effort was a tribute to the late Charlie Kirk. The TPUSA founder, who was fatally shot on September 10, 2025, was honored before a single guitar chord rang out. What followed was a sharp contrast between celebration and protest, vision and backlash.The TPUSA All American halftime show opened with Jack Posobiec declaring, “This one's for you Charlie.” On social media, one supporter added, “This is for Erika, Charlie and their family.” Performers echoed that tone. Lee Brice told viewers, “Charlie gave people a microphone so they could say what's on their mind…this is on mine,” before dedicating a song to Kirk. The YouTube stream drew over five million views, signaling a sizable audience for the alternative event.Inside the stadium, Bad Bunny pressed forward with a tightly crafted 13 minute performance built in just two months.Creative director Harriet Cuddeford said the show carried a simple mission. “If everyone else is making all of this noise, cool, but like, we know what we’re doing,” she said, brushing aside outside criticism.The production leaned into storytelling. More than 300 dancers filled segmented stages designed as neighborhood vignettes. A real wedding unfolded mid set, chosen from fan invitations the singer personally reviewed.Late in the performance, he held up a football that read “Together, we are America.” Cuddeford later summed up the message: “We have the same world. We’re all one. We’re all humans. Let us be the same.”Critics were loud. President Donald Trump called the show “one of the worst, EVER!” Yet the numbers told a broader story. Millions watched. Millions debated. And for one Sunday night, halftime became a mirror reflecting two very different visions of America.","Super Bowl LX became a cultural flashpoint as Bad Bunny’s historic halftime show unfolded alongside a TPUSA alternative event honoring the late Charlie Kirk.

With three young children at home, the brief health setback drew attention from fans. The Mahomes family, together since high school and married in 2022, now navigates both recovery and routine life away from the field.

Brittany Mahomes feeling ‘very unwell’ as stomach bug keeps her in bed

Patrick Mahomes has spent the past two months focused on rehab, far from the roar of Arrowhead Stadium. Now it is Brittany Mahomes who finds herself sidelined. On Thursday night, she let fans in on a rough day, sharing that she had been down with a stomach bug while juggling life at home with three young children.The timing has not been easy. Patrick’s season ended abruptly in mid-December after a serious knee injury against the Los Angeles Chargers. Since then, the spotlight has shifted from game plans to recovery schedules. This week, though, it was Brittany who needed rest, offering a brief but honest update that quickly caught attention.Brittany, 30, revealed on Instagram that she had been out of commission. “Just still recapping cause I have been in bed all day very unwell from the stomach bug 😵‍💫🤦‍♀️,” she wrote on her story Thursday night. She did not share when the illness began or how she may have caught it. What she did make clear was that it had knocked her flat for the day.For a mother of three, being stuck in bed is rarely simple. The Mahomes household is busy. Sterling turns five this month. Bronze is three. Their youngest, Golden, recently celebrated her first birthday. Managing that kind of energy while feeling sick is no small task, even with support around.The couple’s bond has been a steady theme throughout Patrick’s rise in the NFL . They began dating in high school in Texas back in 2012 and got engaged after his Super Bowl 54 ring ceremony. Their wedding followed in March 2022 in Maui. Through MVP awards, playoff runs, and now injury rehab, they have shared the highs and the tougher stretches.Patrick continues to work back from a torn ACL and LCL in his left knee, injuries that ended his ninth NFL season. Brittany’s illness is far less severe, but it serves as a reminder that even high-profile families deal with everyday setbacks. Sometimes the biggest win is simply getting through the week.","Brittany Mahomes shared that she was ‘very unwell from the stomach bug,’ spending the day in bed as Patrick Mahomes continues rehab from his season- ending knee injury.

Age and Roster Snapshot

Early Outlook for this Mock Trade

Theare reportedly exploring a trade that would bringto the team. The move is being discussed as a way to strengthen the roster around Victor Wembanyama and support a push toward playoff contention in the 2025-26 season.San Antonio has stayed competitive in the Western Conference, while Dallas has fallen to 19-34. With both teams heading in different directions, a deal could address immediate needs for each side. The Spurs would add outside shooting and experience, and the Mavericks could create salary flexibility while reshaping the roster.The San Antonio Spurs are built around Victor Wembanyama and a young group that includes Devin Vassell, Stephon Castle, Keldon Johnson, and Julian Champagnie. Veterans Harrison Barnes, Kelly Olynyk, and Luke Kornet are on expiring contracts, giving the front office options if it chooses to make a move.Dallas Mavericks have used Klay Thompson mostly off the bench alongside Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, P.J. Washington, Cooper Flagg, and Dereck Lively II. Recent losses have highlighted the team’s inconsistent three-point shooting.The finances make a trade possible. Thompson carries a $16.7 million cap hit for 2025-26, while expiring deals such as Olynyk’s $25.5 million and Barnes’ $28.5 million can help match salaries without requiring draft picks.One scenario would send Klay Thompson and injured guard Dante Exum to San Antonio. Dallas could receive Kelly Olynyk, Lindy Waters III, and either Harrison Barnes or Keldon Johnson to keep the incoming and outgoing salary near the $18-20 million range.This approach allows the Spurs to keep their young core, Wembanyama, Vassell, and Castle, while Dallas clears Thompson’s $17.5 million expiring contract for the 2026-27 season. It also helps the Mavericks manage second-apron pressure.Klay Thompson would give San Antonio a reliable catch-and-shoot option and more spacing around Wembanyama and Vassell. His experience could also help younger players such as Castle and Harper. Even with the move, the Spurs are projected to have about $41 million in cap space for 2026.Dallas would lower payroll by roughly $3.2 million this season and open minutes for younger players such as Flagg or Christie. The added flexibility could help the team build around Irving and Davis while avoiding deeper tax penalties.• Immediate shooting help with a 37.6% three-point shooter.• Veteran presence for a roster that averages around 25 years old.• Expiring contracts help protect future cap space.• Thompson’s age does not match Wembanyama’s timeline.• Trading Olynyk removes a stretch-five and reduces depth.• Financial relief and more roster flexibility.• More opportunities for younger players.• Loss of a proven shooter despite a 35.8% win rate.The potential pairing would put 22-year-old, 7-foot-4 Wembanyama next to the 36-year-old Thompson, a 6-foot-6 guard. Moving the 34-year-old Olynyk would help the Spurs stay younger overall while continuing to build around their franchise player.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to land Utah Jazz's Walker Kessler amid LeBron James free agency If the trade happens, San Antonio would take a step toward competing sooner without giving up future assets.

Impact on LeBron’s future

Who benefits?

Thehave been connected to a possible trade foras the team weighs its current title push against an uncertain future. Los Angeles is 33-21, leads the Pacific Division, and is building around Luka Dončić, LeBron James, and Deandre Ayton. With James on an expiring contract and expected to reach free agency in 2026, the front office has reason to look for younger players who can contribute now and remain part of the roster later.Kessler fits that profile. He is productive, still early in his career, and under team control for the short term. Several teams are monitoring his situation, but the Lakers stand out because of their need for interior defense and long-term stability at center.The Los Angeles Lakers are competing near the top of the Western Conference and are focused on strengthening a playoff roster. Planning ahead matters with James’ future unresolved, and adding a younger impact player would help reduce the risk of a major drop-off if he leaves.Utah is in a rebuild. The Jazz are 18-38 and sit 13th in the West despite strong scoring from Lauri Markkanen and a roster filled with recent first-round picks.Defense has been a problem for two straight seasons, and reported tension around Kessler’s extension, believed to be in the nine-figure range over five years, has increased the chances that the team could move him.On the court, Walker Kessler is averaging roughly 14.4 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 3.0 assists while shooting above 70 percent from the field with true shooting over 78 percent. His rim protection remains his main value, which explains why contenders are paying attention.A trade would likely focus on young talent and draft picks rather than a core player.Possible structure:- Los Angeles Lakers receive: Walker Kessler- Utah Jazz receive:• A young rotation player on a rookie-scale contract• A salary-matching veteran on a short or mid-range deal• At least one future first-round pick and a second-round pickKessler’s current salary makes matching contracts manageable. Utah would prioritize long-term assets, while the Lakers are unlikely to move Dončić, James, Ayton, or other key contributors if the goal is to compete this season.The framework could expand depending on negotiations. Utah might try to include another veteran contract, and Los Angeles could add a minimum-salary player or pick swap to finalize value.Kessler would improve interior defense and rebounding, allowing perimeter defenders to pressure the ball more often. He also gives the team another starting-level center next to Ayton, creating lineup flexibility and injury insurance. His timeline matches Dončić’s prime years, which helps the franchise plan beyond the James era.Moving Kessler would turn a pending extension into draft capital and a developmental player. It would also ease a crowded frontcourt that includes Jusuf Nurkić, Kevin Love, Taylor Hendricks, and Kyle Filipowski. The move would better align with a young perimeter group featuring Keyonte George, Isaiah Collier, Cody Williams, Ace Bailey, Brice Sensabaugh, and Walter Clayton Jr..Kessler scores mostly on high-percentage attempts such as lobs, dunks, and short rolls, making him a strong fit next to a ball-dominant creator like Dončić. Utah allowing 125.9 points per game also raises the question of whether committing major money to one defensive center makes sense during a rebuild.• Stronger paint defense.• Adds a young core player.• Greater lineup flexibility with two starting-caliber centers.• Likely cost includes a first-round pick and a young contributor.• Future salary pressure if Kessler signs a large extension.• Possible overlap with another traditional center.• Gains draft assets before an expensive extension.• Clears minutes in the frontcourt.• Maintains financial flexibility.• Defense could decline further without a proven rim protector.• Continued rebuilding may test fan patience.• Draft picks carry uncertainty.Trading for Kessler would show that the Lakers remain focused on competing while James is still under contract. It would also leave the team with a younger foundation if he decides to leave in 2026.In the short term, the Lakers would likely improve by adding an efficient young center without breaking up their core. Utah’s outcome would depend on how the incoming assets develop compared to Kessler’s progress.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Clippers predicted to cut ties with $152.4 million superstar prior offseason after blockbuster James Harden departure The deal has a clear logic for both sides, immediate help for a contender and long-term value for a rebuilding team.",The Los Angeles Lakers and Utah Jazz have been linked to a possible trade for Walker Kessler.

My Final Thoughts on Chris Paul's All-Time Ranking in the NBA

, ending a career that lasted more than 20 seasons. Few point guards managed games as carefully as he did, and even fewer combined passing, scoring, and defense at the same level for so long.Still, his place in history is not fully settled. Many analysts rank him somewhere between fourth and eighth among all-time point guards. The disagreement usually comes down to what matters more, championships and MVP awards, or consistency, efficiency, and long-term production.Chris Paul stepped away from the league shortly after being waived by the Toronto Raptors. He finished with 1,370 regular-season games and totals of 23,058 points, 6,006 rebounds, 12,552 assists, and 2,728 steals. He became the first player in NBA history to record at least 23,000 points and 12,000 assists.His honors include 12 All-Star selections, 11 All-NBA teams, and nine All-Defensive teams. He retired second in league history in both assists and steals, behind only John Stockton.Advanced statistics often rated him among the league’s most effective players. During his prime, he regularly ranked near the top in metrics such as box plus-minus, value over replacement player, and win shares per 48 minutes.Teams usually improved when he joined them. New Orleans became competitive, the Clippers turned into a regular 50-win team, Houston pushed Golden State to seven games, Oklahoma City exceeded expectations after trading Russell Westbrook, and Phoenix reached the 2021 Finals. Late stops with Golden State, San Antonio, and a brief return to the Clippers showed his durability, even though his final season was limited to 16 games, where he averaged 2.9 points and 3.3 assists before stopping play in December 2025.Most historical lists begin with Magic Johnson, Stephen Curry, and Oscar Robertson.Magic won five championships and redefined the position with his size and passing. Curry reshaped modern offense with his shooting while winning four titles and two MVP awards. Robertson produced historic all-around numbers and added both an MVP and a championship to his résumé.Because those three are widely placed at the top, Paul’s argument is usually about whether he belongs in the next two spots.The debate often includes Isiah Thomas, John Stockton, Jerry West (depending on how positions are defined), Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, Walt Frazier, and Bob Cousy.Several of them have achievements Paul does not. Thomas led Detroit to two championships and won Finals MVP. Kidd guided Dallas to the 2011 title and reached the Finals twice earlier in his career. Nash won two MVP awards. Stockton still holds large leads in career assists and steals.Supporters of Paul point to his efficiency. He shot better from three than Thomas or Kidd, committed fewer turnovers than Nash, and provided more reliable perimeter defense than many offense-focused guards.Paul never won an NBA title, and that remains the biggest argument against his top-five case.There were close calls. The Clippers lost a 3-1 series lead to Houston in 2015. Houston led Golden State 3-2 in the 2018 Western Conference Finals before Paul suffered a hamstring injury that kept him out of the final two games. Phoenix took a 2-0 lead in the 2021 Finals but lost the series in six.Even without a championship, his playoff record shows steady production which boasts 149 games, nearly 3,000 points, and 1,233 assists.Calling Chris Paul a top-five point guard is reasonable, but it is not universally accepted. His numbers, defense, and ability to improve teams support the argument.However, the lack of a title or MVP keeps some analysts from placing him automatically in that group. A common view puts Magic, Curry, and Robertson clearly at the top, with Paul competing alongside Isiah Thomas and John Stockton just behind them.Also read: Chris Paul NBA teams timeline: How the HOFer point guard played for nine franchises across a 21-year career For those who value championships most, his résumé may feel incomplete.

Chris Paul's Legacy: influence without a championship

Chris Paul retired in February 2026 after 21 NBA seasons. He is often called the “Point God” and he managed to stay in good form late into his late 30s and early 40s. As a result, he should have enough achievements to earn him a place in the Hall of Fame. His final months in the league featured trades, roster changes, and key milestones, which went to show how versatile Paul has been over the years.He announced his retirement on February 13, 2026, soon after the Toronto Raptors waived him. Paul retires as a 12-time All-Star, an 11-time All-NBA selection, and a nine-time All-Defensive pick. Wherever he played, teams tended to look more structured and were often tougher to beat in close games.Chris Paul finished second all-time in assists with more than 12,500 and ranked among the top five in steals. He became the first player in league history to record at least 20,000 points and 10,000 assists and later pushed those totals beyond 23,000 points and 12,000 assists.Over 1,370 games, he recorded 23,058 points, 12,552 assists, and 2,728 steals. The only major achievement missing from his career is an NBA title.He does, however, retire with two Olympic gold medals and a strong influence from his time leading the National Basketball Players Association.His career tracked the evolution of the modern NBA - from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina to the Lob City Clippers, Houston’s analytics-driven offense, an unexpected playoff team in Oklahoma City, a Finals run in Phoenix, a short stop in Golden State, a mentoring role in San Antonio, and a complicated final stretch that ended with a trade to Toronto.Selected fourth overall in 2005, Chris Paul quickly took charge of the Hornets’ offense and won Rookie of the Year. He was very good at running the pick-and-roll and knew how to control the speed of the game from the beginning.During his prime in New Orleans, he finished second in MVP voting and led the team to 56 wins in the 2007-08 season. His chemistry with Tyson Chandler and David West powered one of the league’s most reliable lob threats.He also provided stability to a franchise displaced by Hurricane Katrina and played a key role when the team returned to New Orleans. Those years established him as both a leader and one of the league’s top point guards.Chris Paul joined the Clippers in 2011 after the league blocked a proposed trade that would have sent him to the Lakers. His arrival helped turn the franchise into a regular playoff team and started the Lob City era with Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan.From 2011 through 2017, the Clippers posted six straight winning seasons and reached the playoffs each year. Paul earned All-NBA honors every season during that span.The breakthrough never came. Playoff losses, including series against Oklahoma City in 2014 and Houston in 2015, shaped the narrative that postseason success remained out of reach.Paul returned to the Clippers in July 2025 on a one-year minimum contract for his 21st season. The expectation was that he would support James Harden and pursue a championship close to his family.The reunion was short. Limited minutes, a 4-11 start, and tension related to his role led the team to send him home in early December before trading him in February 2026.Chris Paul’s move to Houston paired him with James Harden in one of the league’s most efficient offenses under Mike D’Antoni.The Rockets won 65 games in 2018 and led Golden State 3-2 in the Western Conference finals before Paul suffered a hamstring injury in Game 5. Houston lost the series, and the injury remains one of the major turning points of that postseason.In 2019, the Rockets traded him for Russell Westbrook, ending a short partnership that still represented his closest path to reaching the Finals during the Warriors’ peak.Many expected Oklahoma City to rebuild after acquiring Paul, but he helped guide the team to the playoffs. He mentored Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and anchored a lineup that performed well late in games.The season reinforced his reputation as a guard who could organize any roster and keep games competitive.Chris Paul joined Phoenix in 2020 and helped turn a young team into a real contender. Along with Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton, he led the Suns to the 2021 NBA Finals.During that time, he passed 20,000 career points and 10,000 assists, strengthening a record that already ranked him among the league’s most productive guards.Phoenix later shifted its focus to a core built around Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, which resulted in Paul moving on to his next team.In Golden State, Paul operated within a motion offense that relied on constant off-ball movement, a shift from the ball-dominant systems he had often directed.He accepted a bench role, steadied the second unit, and continued to add to his assist and steal totals. The Warriors, managing an aging roster, were unable to make a deep playoff run.Chris Paul signed with San Antonio in 2024 and stepped into a starting role on a roster led by Victor Wembanyama.He started all 82 games during the 2024-25 season, reached 12,000 assists, and passed Jason Kidd for second place on the all-time assists and steals lists. As the Spurs prepared to develop a younger backcourt, Paul entered free agency looking for one more chance to compete for a title.By this stage, he was no longer a primary scorer but remained a reliable organizer on the floor.The Los Angeles Clippers described Paul’s return as both a leadership move and a nod to franchise history.His role was limited. He averaged 2.9 points and 3.3 assists in 16 appearances, with his final game coming on December 1. Reports later pointed to friction tied to his presence in the locker room, and the team separated from him before using his contract in a trade to gain financial flexibility.The ending lacked the structure often given to longtime stars.On February 4, 2026, the Clippers traded Paul to Toronto as part of a three-team deal involving the Nets. The move was primarily financial, and the Raptors were not expected to bring him into the lineup.Toronto waived him on February 12. About a day later, he announced his retirement, ending his career without playing a game for the franchise.Feb 2026 Toronto Raptors Acquired in three-team trade, waived without playing, then retired.Nine franchises - close to a quarter of the league - is an unusually high number for a player who maintained elite production for most of his career.Chris Paul retires second only to John Stockton in assists and remains one of the most productive two-way guards in league history. His mid-range shooting, pick-and-roll execution, and late-game control influenced many guards who followed him.Also read: When will Chris Paul enter the Hall of Fame? A clear look at ex Los Angeles Clippers star's eligibility timeline A championship never came, but his consistency, leadership, and statistical output place him among the defining point guards of his generation. Across every stop - New Orleans, Los Angeles, Houston, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, Golden State, and San Antonio - teams typically improved after he arrived.","Chris Paul retired in February 2026 after 21 NBA seasons. He is often called the ‘Point God’ and he managed to stay in good form late into his late 30s and early 40s.

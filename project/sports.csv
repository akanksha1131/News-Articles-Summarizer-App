At the end of Day 25 of what had been a remarkable five-match Test series, India were the ones celebrating, soaking in the applause from a packed venue, doing a lap of honour of The Oval stadium. They had reason to be joyous, it had been a sensational turnaround from what looked like a near certain 3-1 series outcome just days ago. Or, worse, a 4-1 just a day ago. Instead, here, now, at that moment, it had become 2-2 in the inaugural Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.But to think of sport as linear and straightforward is taking away its essence. The sheer unpredictability, the off-script nature of it all is the beauty of it. That's what makes it intriguing, it could have been 3-1 or 4-1 to hosts England.From 0/2 at Old Trafford, trailing by 311 runs, five sessions remaining, India produced a staggering comeback to draw the fourth Test. Moving a few days forward, England were 42 runs from a win at The Oval, six wickets in hand, Joe Root in the middle, and were left six runs short.Except things don't always go to script and that's the beauty of any sport. If a ploy works, it is lauded as a great strategy. Genius. If it doesn't, it is lambasted for being too ambitious, absurd, or called out as 'Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!'All said and done, India had a glorious opportunity to tip the series their way, instead, as well.England didn't boss India around with tough conditions, spicy pitches or under the constant threat of some of the most menacing seamers. The batting didn't have the teeth, either, with the exception of Joe Root.Time and again, India played into England's hands. Even if you discount the baffling team selections, cavalier dismissals near the session breaks or losing heaps of wickets in a short duration. The Shubman Gill-led unit could have been walking back with a series win if they had done the basics right - catches and tight bowling. On both fronts, India gave away plenty of advantage and would be kicking themselves when the series would be assessed through a microscopic lense.By letting down 23 catches through the series, including 10 in the opener at Headingley, England were allowed to score 718 runs more. On the other hand, the Ben Stokes-led hosts were equally woeful - letting go of 17 catches that cost them 587 runs. On an average, India saw 31.21 runs being scored more as they let a chance go by. In the same department, England were slightly worse at 34.52 runs on an average.Another metric, that has been less discussed, has remained in the shadows, is the sheer audacity with which England scored runs against India throughout the series.India had 91 maiden overs throughout the five matches compared to England's 148. England's economy rate stood at 3.50 runs an over during the series while that of India was 3.98.Most of India's maidens came in the third Test, which incidentally England won by 22 runs. On the other end, India's fewest maidens came in the first and fourth Test where England scored 465, 373 and 669 runs, respectively.R Ashwin astutely observed that not only did England keep India's maidens down, they kept the scoring rate high to ensure they copped little pressure. ""As the understanding goes, if you bowl three maidens in a row, you will get a wicket-taking chance. But why have the maidens not come through from the India side? Two reasons - England put a lot of pressure. Barring Lord's, England played at (a) high accelerated pace. But another is that India's 1-2 run overs are low. India have (even) conceded 10-12 runs per over,"" he said on his YouTube show.""(Mohammed) Siraj, Prasidh (Krishna), Akash Deep need to find rhythm. For bowlers, until they get that rhythm, they need to place the field right to build that defensive pressure building, which India have missed. India could have attacked or bowled smartly against England to counter their Bazball approach,"" he added.Does Ashwin's argument hold up to the stats? Yes.So of the 808.4 overs that India dished out in the series, 53 of them, or 6.55% of them, saw at least 530 runs - or 16.43% of England's total runs.Simply put,. If basic mistakes and catches dropped were not gifts enough, here were India conceding runs aplenty, thereby squandering any hopes they had of tightening the noose on England. Any desire they had of putting pressure on the hosts, was let go of cheaply.Zoom in further and you identify the bowlers that leaked runs in abundance. Shardul Thakur , who played two matches, conceded 144 runs at an economy rate of 5.33. Anshul Kamboj, who came in as an injury substitute in the squad, went for 89 runs at an economy of 4.94. Prasidh Krishna was equally disastrous at 4.94 even though he salvaged some pride with 14 wickets, including an eight-wicket haul at The Oval.At the other end, Jasprit Bumrah , who played three Tests, was the most economical at 3.04, conceding a total of 364 runs. Also going at less than 4 runs per over were Ravindra Jadeja (3.56), Washington Sundar (3.64) and Nitish Kumar Reddy (3.96).In the end, the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy scoreline reads 2-2. India’s young, transitional side showed they could stand toe-to-toe with England in their own backyard, scripting moments of brilliance and resilience that will be remembered for years. Yet, they also left the door ajar far too often for what could have been a win.","England scored 16.43% of their series runs at a staggeringly brisk rate of 10+ runs an over. India had already bowled fewer maidens than England, India had 53 overs which went for more than 10 runs anover. India played into England's hands, with the exception of Joe Root.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123248261,imgsize-104786,width-400,resizemode-4/123248261.jpg"

Poll Have you ever received a call or message intended for someone else? Yes, multiple times Yes, once No, never I’m not sure

In a strange twist of cricket and mistaken identities, two separate incidents have shown just how tricky phone numbers can be for players and fans alike.Recently in Chhattisgarh, a man bought a new SIM card only to discover it was once used by Royal Challengers Bengaluru batter Rajat Patidar . Soon, the phone started buzzing with calls from none other than Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers . Once Patidar got wind of the situation, he informed the police, and the man eventually returned the SIM.Speaking about the story on his YouTube channel, former India off-spinner R Ashwin shared a similar experience of his own. He said he recently received a WhatsApp message from an unknown number claiming to be New Zealand and Chennai Super Kings batter Devon Conway . At first, Ashwin believed it might be genuine. But when the person asked him for Virat Kohli ’s number, doubts began to creep in.To test the situation, Ashwin shared a non-active number for Kohli. He then casually asked about a bat he had supposedly given to Conway. The reply came back that the bat was “good”, which confirmed Ashwin’s suspicion — because in reality, he had never given Conway any bat at all.Ashwin quickly blocked the number and checked through Chennai Super Kings’ communication channels, only to confirm it was a fake account.Both incidents show how easily impersonation can happen and how even cricketers need to be cautious about who they are really speaking to on the other end of the line.",Two separate incidents have shown just how tricky phone numbers can be for players and fans alike.

Poll Should Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli continue playing ODIs? Yes, they should continue No, it's time for younger players Only if they perform well Undecided

Former India opener and ex-selector Devang Gandhi believes the younger crop has shown they are ready for all challenges, casting doubt on Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli’s ODI futures.“How will you make players like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rishabh Pant, Sai Sudharsan, among others, sit out when they have shown how well they can adapt? The bigger transition is from T20s to Tests. Once a player has done well in Test cricket and has the power game, ODIs should come easier to them. It is very important that the selectors and the team management sit together and take a call,” Gandhi told TOI.Gandhi stressed that regular game-time is crucial and urged the selectors to honestly assess whether Virat and Rohit can remain at their peak over the next two years.“If, say, in a year’s time, we come to a situation where one of them is not firing and we need a replacement, the team management may not have enough time to prepare a player for the job,” Gandhi said.The captaincy question is equally important, and the selectors must make a decision. Gill has already proven himself ready to lead in Tests and, given his current form, is arguably India’s best ODI batsman, averaging 59.04 with a strike rate of 99.56.His performances have earned him the team’s respect, making the ODI captaincy a natural fit.“There’s absolutely no doubt about the contribution of Rohit and Virat. But time doesn’t wait for anybody,” Gandhi added.With Rohit and Virat — who retired from T20Is in 2024 and stepped away from Test cricket earlier this year — the speculation about their ODI future has been rife. For now, though, it appears they may give one final push to the format they dominated for over 15 years.If they wish to extend their ODI careers beyond October, both may need to feature in domestic one-day competitions like the Vijay Hazare Trophy in December, as well as the ‘A’ series against Australia and South Africa, in addition to international fixtures.At this stage of their careers, however, there remains uncertainty over whether these legends would be willing to endure the grind of domestic one-day cricket in far-flung venues once again.",Former India opener Devang Gandhi believes the younger crop has shown they are ready for all challenges.

Poll Should CSK consider releasing Ravichandran Ashwin before IPL 2026? Yes, it's time for a change No, he should stay

Former Chennai Super Kings player S Badrinath has expressed his views on Ravichandran Ashwin 's high-price acquisition by CSK and potential team changes, stating that while Ashwin adds value to the five-time IPL champions, his INR 9.75 crore price tag may not justify his current form, especially amid reports of the off-spinner's interest in leaving the franchise before IPL 2026.The comments come as CSK faces potential roster changes, with Ashwin having played only nine out of 14 league matches in the 2024 edition after being purchased at the mega auction in November 2024.Speaking on his YouTube channel ""Cric it with Badri,"" Badrinath shared his perspective on Ashwin's value to the team and his price point.""I feel Ashwin adds value to CSK, but not at Rs 10 crore (Rs 9.75 crore). In the IPL, you need to see the price point and the player. He is definitely not at his peak. That is why I have been maintaining from the start that Ashwin has to be released,"" Badrinath stated.The situation has become more complex with reports of Sanju Samson requesting Rajasthan Royals (RR) to either trade or release him into the auction, coinciding with Ashwin's potential departure from CSK.Badrinath addressed the uncertainty surrounding MS Dhoni 's future and the potential impact of Samson's inclusion in the team.""We don't know if MS Dhoni is going to continue playing or not. That decision has not yet been made. He might play a few matches, or he could play a few matches at Chepauk. There might be a brand value attached. He could attract a few brands. He might announce till the IPL season starts. The presence of Sanju Samson could create confusion, which is what I feel,"" the two-time IPL winner explained.The discussion around team changes has drawn attention from other cricket personalities, including former India captain Krish Srikkanth, who suggested Samson as a suitable replacement for MS Dhoni at CSK.However, Srikkanth also noted that if he were part of the RR management, he would be reluctant to let go of the 30-year-old wicketkeeper-batter.These developments highlight the strategic considerations teams face regarding player retention, trades, and future planning, particularly for established franchises like CSK managing transitions of veteran players.The situation remains fluid as teams prepare for potential roster changes ahead of IPL 2026, with both Ashwin's and Samson's futures becoming significant talking points in the cricket community.Both players' situations reflect the broader dynamics of IPL team management, where factors such as player performance, team balance, and financial considerations play crucial roles in decision-making processes.The coming months will likely provide more clarity on these potential moves as teams finalize their strategies for upcoming seasons and make decisions about player retention and acquisitions.",S Badrinath says Ravichandran Ashwin should be released by Chennai Super Kings.

On Saturday, he also paid a visit to Lucknow to meet his sisters on the occasion of Rakshabandhan. Despite his busy schedule, Akash Deep took time out to talk to TOI on his experiences of the long English tour.Opening up on the controversy involving Ben Duckett during the Oval Test, Akash Deep revealed that he told Duckett that he won't be the only one to hit and he would hit too. Akash Deep gave a sendoff to the England opener by putting his hand around his shoulder and uttering a few words to him after dismissing him. The images went viral.""On a cricket field, you need to keep a cool head. I told Duckett, 'You won't be the only one hitting; I'll hit too. Sometimes you miss, and I hit'.""Akash Deep said that Duckett had told him that he would not be able to dismiss him and whatever he said to Duckett was in response. “It was quite a good experience. Every pace bowler wants to play in England. Although the wickets were not as we had expected, we still put our heart and soul into every match to end the hard-fought series on even terms.The series was a great learning for me.”""Taking ten wickets individually in a match (at Edgbaston, which India won) is quite significant but scoring a half century for the team was more important to me. While I was working on my half-century, the only thing on my mind was not to get out and to keep playing,"" he added.Asked about dedicating his 10-wicket match haul in the second Test at Birmingham to his elder sister who is suffering from cancer, he said, ""My message was not just for my sister; it was for the entire country and the world, emphasizing the importance of standing by loved ones during difficult times.""On the final day of the last Test at the Oval, Akash Deep remembers, ""I woke up early due to excitement, knowing we needed four wickets, and England wanted just 35 runs, and that only we three pacers had to do it. But we believed in ourselves, and the England batters apparently panicked. We didn't know the ball would start swinging in the morning, but once it did, we realized the wickets would fall quickly, and that's what happened. ""On his partner in attack, Mohammed Siraj , Akash Deep said, ""As a fast bowler, he is fit, and the way he puts in effort behind the ball sets him apart. Playing five consecutive matches is commendable.

Following India's impressive Test series against England, Shubman Gill has opted to captain North Zone in the forthcoming Duleep Trophy, commencing August 28 in Bengaluru, rather than taking a rest period.The 25-year-old will lead a 15-member squad featuring pacers Anshul Kamboj, Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana.Cricket icon Sunil Gavaskar has praised this decision, particularly noteworthy given Gill's recent performance of 754 runs at 75.4, including four centuries in his maiden series as Test captain.This marks Gill's inaugural captaincy of North Zone in this prestigious competition, which returns to its traditional format.Writing for Sportstar, Gavaskar commended the BCCI 's commitment to domestic cricket, choosing it over an international white-ball series.""It was good, therefore, to see that after the tour to Bangladesh was postponed to next year, the BCCI resisted the pressure to send a team for a white-ball series to Sri Lanka this month,"" wrote Gavaskar.""By doing that, the BCCI have prioritised domestic cricket, as it means that now most, if not all, of the top players will be available to play in the Duleep Trophy tournament starting shortly.Shubman Gill, captaining the North Zone team is a massive shot in the arm for this tournament.""Gavaskar further noted the exemplary nature of Gill's commitment, stating, ""By being available for the tournament, the Indian skipper is sending the right signal to the other members of the team. It would have been understandable if, after a gruelling tour where five Test matches were crammed in a little over six weeks, he had opted to rest.""Regarding the fast bowlers' absence, Gavaskar supported the decision: ""The fast bowlers not playing is good thinking, as it has been an unusually hot summer in England, thanks to global warming, and their energies must have been expended after the untiring spells they bowled throughout the series.""With the Asia Cup beginning September 9 concurrent with the Duleep Trophy, the North Zone squad might face alterations if players receive national call-ups.Currently, Gill's participation significantly enhances the tournament's prestige. Despite his previous experience leading in 10 First Class matches, this responsibility presents a unique challenge in managing a zonal team in knockout competition.","Shubman Gill will captain North Zone in the forthcoming Duleep Trophy, commencing August 28 in Bengaluru. The 25-year-old will lead a 15-member squad featuring pacers Anshul Kamboj, Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana.

Azharuddin made the remarks at the launch of Kirmani’s autobiography ‘Stumped: Life Behind and Beyond The Twenty-Two Yards’.""He is the number one wicket-keeper in the world. Such a wicket-keeper was never born. It was not easy for him to do wicketkeeping with four spinners. He took many good catches in the World Cup in 1983. Even in the match when Kapil scored 175 runs, he scored crucial 24 runs. I am very happy to attend this event today. May god give him a long life.

Poll Do you believe Crystal Palace can continue to build on their recent success? Yes, they are on the rise! No, it was just a lucky win.

Crystal Palace secured their first-ever Community Shield victory by defeating Premier League champions Liverpool 3-2 on penalties after a 2-2 draw at Wembley Stadium on Sunday. The match was played against the backdrop of tragedy following the death of Liverpool forward Diogo Jota in a car accident alongside his brother Andre Silva.Liverpool's new signings Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong scored for their side, while Palace responded through Jean-Philippe Mateta and Ismaila Sarr to force the game into penalties. Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson proved decisive in the shootout, saving attempts from Alexis Mac Allister and Harvey Elliott, while Mohamed Salah missed his spot-kick.The pre-match ceremony saw Liverpool legend Ian Rush and Palace chairman Steve Parish laying wreaths on the pitch in memory of Jota. The Liverpool end displayed numerous banners and flags paying tribute to the Portuguese international, though a minute's silence was cut short due to crowd disturbances.Liverpool fielded all four of their new summer signings, worth a combined £260 million, including Ekitike, Florian Wirtz, Frimpong, and Milos Kerkez.The club's record-equalling 20th league title last season prompted this significant investment in new talent.Ekitike, who joined from Eintracht Frankfurt for £69 million, made an immediate impact by scoring just four minutes into the match from Wirtz's assist. His performance came amid speculation about Liverpool's pursuit of Newcastle striker Alexander Isak.Palace, making their debut appearance in the Community Shield, demonstrated their ability to compete with Premier League elite. After Mateta missed a one-on-one opportunity against Alisson Becker, Sarr won a penalty after being fouled by Virgil van Dijk . Mateta converted the spot-kick to level the score.Liverpool's players wore a ""Forever 20"" emblem, commemorating Jota's retired shirt number, which they will display throughout the season. The team regained the lead when Frimpong's cross unexpectedly found the far corner of the net.Despite creating opportunities, including a missed chance by Ekitike from another Wirtz pass, Liverpool showed defensive vulnerabilities. Palace capitalized on this weakness when Sarr scored his fourth goal in seven matches against Liverpool, connecting with Adam Wharton's through ball.The match saw additional drama with a VAR review for a potential handball by Mac Allister before proceeding directly to penalties. In the shootout, Palace's Justin Devenny emerged as the unlikely hero, scoring the decisive penalty to secure the trophy.The victory builds on Palace's recent success, following their first major trophy win against Manchester City in May's FA Cup final. The result suggests Palace's growing stature in English football while highlighting potential defensive concerns for Liverpool's new-look squad under manager Slot.The match served as both the traditional season opener and a poignant tribute to Jota, whose tragic loss cast a shadow over Liverpool's pre-season preparations and summer transfer activities.","Crystal Palace defeated Premier League champions Liverpool 3-2 on penalties.

Fortuna Düsseldorf chairman Klaus Allofs has defended the German club’s decision to withdraw from signing Israeli striker Shon Weissman following opposition from sections of the fanbase over the player’s social media activity relating to the Gaza conflict.The second-division side had been in advanced talks to bring Weissman from Spanish club Granada but announced on Tuesday that the move would not go ahead. While the club did not specify the reason at the time, a later statement explained that Weissman’s past online statements and how they were handled did not align with Fortuna’s values.Fans had raised objections to the 29-year-old’s posts expressing support for Israel’s actions in Gaza after the events of October 7, 2023. Weissman has since set his Instagram account to private.Speaking ahead of Düsseldorf’s match against Hannover on Saturday, Allofs rejected claims the club’s stance was antisemitic. “It’s absurd, to put it bluntly,” he said. “We tried to sign a player, which is legitimate. It's also part of our values, that we don't limit ourselves with prejudices and rule things out from the start.”Allofs added that the decision was reached after consultation with Jewish community members in Düsseldorf, noting that while the process could have been quicker, the club wanted to consider the matter carefully.Weissman, who joined Granada in 2022, had previously faced security concerns related to his social media activity. Shortly after the October 2023 events, he missed a La Liga match against Osasuna amid worries about the atmosphere from some home fans.The controversy has put Fortuna Düsseldorf in the middle of a broader debate over whether clubs should weigh political or social positions when considering signings.

Egyptian football star Mohamed Salah has publicly challenged UEFA after the death of celebrated Palestinian footballer Suleiman al-Obeid, known as the “Palestinian Pelé,” in southern Gaza.On Wednesday, the Palestine Football Association (PFA) said al-Obeid, 41, was killed when Israeli forces struck a crowd waiting for humanitarian aid.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

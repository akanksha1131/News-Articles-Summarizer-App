"Novak Djokovic's PTPA launches legal action against ITF, ATP, WTA, ITIA for anti-competitive practices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/novak-djokovics-ptpa-launches-legal-action-against-itf-atp-wta-itia-for-anti-competitive-practices/articleshow/119187393.cms,"Logo of the Professional Tennis Players Association - a player body created by Novak Djokovic among others.

The Professional Tennis Players' Association ( PTPA ), co-founded by Novak Djokovic , has initiated legal proceedings against major tennis governing bodies .The lawsuit targets the Association of Tennis Professionals ( ATP ), Women's Tennis Association ( WTA ), International Tennis Federation ( ITF ), and International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA).The legal actions are being filed across multiple jurisdictions including the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union.The ATP and WTA have stated they will defend against these claims.The PTPA, established in 2020 by Djokovic and Canadian player Vasek Pospisil, has gathered support from approximately 20 players who are participating in at least one of the legal actions.""The lawsuits expose systemic abuse, anti-competitive practices, and a blatant disregard for player welfare that have persisted for decades,"" said the PTPA statement.""The ATP, WTA, ITF, and ITIA operate as a cartel by implementing a number of draconian, interlocking anti-competitive restraints and abusive practices.""""Tennis is broken,"" said Ahmad Nassar, Executive Director of the PTPA.""Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardises their health and safety.""The PTPA's allegations include collusion among governing bodies, unfair prize money distribution, and demanding schedules.The organisation also points to player welfare concerns, including matches in extreme heat, late-night finishes, and inconsistent tennis ball specifications.Additional complaints address image rights, sponsorship limitations, and ranking point systems.""Players are subjected to invasive searches of personal devices, random middle-of-the-night drug tests, and interrogations without legal representation,"" the statement noted.""While the ATP has remained focused on delivering reforms that benefit players at multiple levels, the PTPA has consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress,"" the ATP responded.The ATP further defended its position, stating they reject the PTPA's claims and will defend their stance vigorously.The WTA described the PTPA's action as ""both regrettable and misguided"" and promised a strong defence.The ITIA emphasised the importance of maintaining anti-doping and anti-corruption programs in tennis.""The ITIA seeks to uphold the highest standards in our work, following best practice and appropriate rules throughout the management of cases, from intelligence gathering through to investigations and, where applicable, sanctions. For our part, we continue to welcome opportunities to engage with any and all members of the sport, including players, coaches, support staff, officials, and media, to build trust in tennis' anti-doping and anti-corruption programmes.""The PTPA's executive council consists of seven members, including Djokovic, Pospisil, Hubert Hurkacz, Ons Jabeur, Bethanie Mattek-Sands, Taylor Townsend, and Zheng Saisai.Several players have joined the legal actions in different jurisdictions, with Nick Kyrgios, Varvara Gracheva, and Reilly Opelka supporting the US case, while Corentin Moutet and Taro Daniel have joined the UK proceedings.","The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) has initiated legal proceedings against major tennis governing bodies.

May 30, 2008. Venue: The Wankhede Stadium. Event: First semifinal of the inaugural IPL between Rajasthan Royals (RR) and Delhi Daredevils (DD). RR had just finished the warm-ups. Their captain Shane Warne walked towards Yusuf Pathan and without saying a word, looked deep into his eyes, placed a hand on his shoulders and just stood for a minute. Pathan, hypnotized, stared back. Despite playing blistering knocks consistently, Pathan had endured a couple of failures, especially against pace bowling. The Royals had lost the toss on a sticky Wankhede pitch and Daredevils had Glenn McGrath, Mohammad Asif and Farveez Maharoof to exploit conditions. Warne’s silent gesture suggested, “Yusuf, I’m backing you. Smash them.” Pathan went on to carve a 21-ball 45, with four sixes which included an audacious smear off McGrath over mid-wicket.One can’t fathom how much that gesture from Warne triggered Pathan, but it showed trust. RR always knew what they wanted when they signed up the sheikh of tweak as captain and coach for essentially a ‘Moneyball’ team.Warne was a poster boy who put bums on seats. And boy, could he bowl and lead! For an inaugural edition, he was perfect. But as the IPL turns 18, how have franchises evolved in terms of choosing captains? Do they look only for a brand? Or do they eye a leader with pedigree?Sanjay Bangar, former India allrounder and ex-head coach of Punjab Kings and RCB who has strategized during numerous auctions, says, “If there are proven captaincy candidates, teams devise their auction strategy around getting a captain first. But if captaincy candidates are not available, the plan is to build a team and find a candidate later.”Previous IPL editions have seen retired greats like Warne, Anil Kumble, Rahul Dravid and Adam Gilchrist excel as leaders. They had limited or no T20I experience. Last year, Shreyas Iyer, despite being away from India’s T20I set up, won the IPL with KKR and commanded a huge price from PBKS this year. What explains that?Bangar says, “Players in leadership roles are preferred even though they are not part of current T20I teams because of their tactical acumen and rare ability to strategize on the go.”Former India batter Pravin Amre, ex-batting coach of Delhi Capitals and Mumbai Indians, concurs with Bangar.“T20 is the most challenging format for captains since a bad move could result in a bad 10 minutes and a loss. A captain has to be switched on for 120 balls,” he said. “When franchises pick a captain, they look at him as someone who can single-handedly win two games out of 14. Also, a captain in such an intense tournament must have a 24/7 open-door policy for players.”Both Bangar and Amre stressed that branding around a captain is not important as all IPL teams now make money through revenue sharing. Bangar and Amre’s points are worth noting. Teams like CSK, PBKS, GT, RCB and KKR are all led by players who are not in the present Indian T20I team.“Ruturaj Gaikwad, Shreyas Iyer, Shubman Gill, Rajat Patidar and Ajinkya Rahane are men who let their performance talk. Gill, of course, is a popular brand, but others are not. Today, pedigree matters more. When picking a captain, we pick someone who is an automatic choice in the playing XI,” says a support staff member of a former championship-winning side.The choice of Rahane to lead KKR, for example, was an interesting one. He hadn’t led in the IPL since captaining RR in 2019. His face doesn’t jump out of screens during breaks. He last played for India in 2023. The franchise doesn’t expect him to break into a ‘korbo lorbo jeetbo re’ jig with team owner Shah Rukh Khan. How can they?Rahane celebrated arguably India’s greatest ever overseas Test triumph at the Gabba in Jan 2021 as a captain with just a quiet hug with Rohit Sharma. But between 2019 and 2024, for Mumbai, he was loaded with trophies. He won the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 as captain at the Eden in 2022. He top-scored in the tourney in 2024 when Shreyas led Mumbai to the title, and won the Ranji and Irani double as skipper in 2024.Another support staff member of a franchise that has contested finals, stresses, “In the auctions, we shortlist players for captaincy options. But you have to alter plans when that player gets sold. Of course, it’s an advantage if your captain is also a star and is playing for India.”In 2025 though, that doesn’t seem necessary.","Shane Warne led Rajasthan Royals to the inaugural IPL title in 2008.

NEW DELHI: It’s been 17 years since Virat Kohli lifted the U-19 World Cup trophy. From that team, only Ravindra Jadeja, Manish Pandey and Kohli are still active in the IPL. This season, they will be reuniting with one more of their teammates when Tanmay Srivastava makes his debut as a BCCI-qualified umpire.Incidentally, Srivastava was India’s top-scorer in the U-19 World Cup final against South Africa in 2008, which earned him a contract with Kings XI Punjab. Srivastava has been fast-tracked as an umpire by the BCCI after clearing the Level 2 course in two years. At 35, he is set to earn the distinction of becoming the first player to have both played and officiated in the IPL.For now, he hasn’t been given on-field duties this season. While most players from the batch have recently retired or are no longer active in top-level cricket , Srivastava decided to retire as a player in 2020 while he was captaining Uttarakhand after moving from UP at the age of 30.“I understood that was the best player I could be,” Srivastava told TOI. “I was nowhere close to playing the IPL. I had to decide if I wanted to prolong life as a player or have a longer successful second innings.”Srivastava admits it was about swallowing his ego. “I am still in touch with Virat, but I had to decide for myself and have a practical outlook,” he added.It was an honest discussion with current BCCI vice-president Rajiv Shukla, a UP cricket mainstay, that gave him clarity.“I told Shukla sir that I wanted to do something else in cricket other than playing. He was a bit taken aback since I was still just 30. Then we discussed what the options could be. I did my Level 2 course in coaching in NCA, but I knew the best I could become was fielding coach. I decided to focus on umpiring,” Srivastava said.In 2020, when he was preparing for the umpiring exams, Srivastava juggled cricketing jobs, a talent scout for RCB and fielding coach for U-16s at NCA and for Jammu and Kashmir.“Studying for umpiring is tough. I used to stay up at nights. You have to study a lot to understand the laws and its implications,” he said.Srivastava credits the BCCI’s umpiring programme, which has a players’ quota.“There is certain relaxation for players irrespective of the level of cricket they’ve played. The board is encouraging young players to take up umpiring rather than heavily depending on older people with bookish knowledge,” he said.",Tanmay Srivastava will make his IPL debut as a BCCI-qualified umpire. The 35-year-old was India’s top-scorer in the U-19 World Cup final against South Africa in 2008. He has been fast-tracked as an umpire by the BCCI.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119188024,imgsize-122460,width-400,resizemode-4/119188024.jpg"

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

Punjab Kings are chasing their first IPL title under new skipper, Shreyas Iyer. What are your thoughts on the team’s chances this season?

Shreyas Iyer has led Mumbai to domestic titles and guided KKR to an IPL title after almost a decade. Do you see him as a ‘lucky charm’ for Punjab Kings?

Have you made any technical adjustments to your game? Also, has there been any conversation regarding your batting position for the upcoming season?

Will you miss your partnership with Ashutosh Sharma, who will be playing for Delhi Capitals this season?

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings are still in pursuit of their maiden Indian Premier League ( IPL ) title. Since the tournament's inception in 2008, they have reached the final only once— in 2014—where they fell short against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). Their only other notable campaign came in the inaugural edition (2008) when they made it to the semifinals. Barring these two instances, Punjab Kings have never reached the playoffs.As IPL 2025 approaches, Punjab Kings will feature several new faces, including captain Shreyas Iyer and head coach Ricky Ponting , who is known for his aggressive style of cricket. The team has also added three dynamic Australian players—Josh Inglis, Glenn Maxwell, and Marcus Stoinis . Meanwhile, they retained players Shashank Singh and Prabhsimran Singh who will provide stability to the batting lineup. The bowling unit will be strengthened by the likes of Arshdeep Singh, Lockie Ferguson, Harpreet Brar, and Yash Thakur.caught up with Shashank to discuss the upcoming season, Shreyas Iyer’s leadership, Ponting’s influence, the impact of all-rounders Maxwell and Stoinis, Yuzvendra Chahal ’s role, and much more ...Obviously, with Shreyas and Ricky sir (Ricky Ponting) in, it's a huge confidence booster. Having known Shreyas for so many years, I know he's a very smart captain who works in a very strategic way. And from whatever I've heard about Ricky sir and the sessions I’ve had with him so far, I've really enjoyed them. He's someone who gives you the freedom, and that's the best thing a cricketer needs. Hopefully, we can turn the tables around this year. And like you said, we are chasing our first title, and hopefully, on the 26th of May, we'll get it.He has won so many trophies this year, which is a huge achievement. People crave even one or two trophies in a year, and he has won five. Obviously, luck plays a role, but his intelligence, hard work, and dedication towards the game are what truly matter.The way he’s bringing his work ethic to the Punjab franchise is amazing. He had multiple discussions with us even before the camp began, and now that he has joined, he is extremely eager to contribute—both individually and for the team. I know him well, and he’s an exceptionally smart captain. If all the stars align, he could win his sixth trophy and maybe even bring Punjab Kings their first title.The team is really strong, and the best part is that everyone is in form. If you look at Maxwell, the way he performed in the Big Bash, or Azmatullah Omarzai’s all-round contributions for Afghanistan. Then there's Josh Inglis, who scored a hundred in the Champions Trophy, Marco Jansen’s impressive bowling, and the way Shreyas is batting—it’s all coming together.It’s just about winning those crucial moments. If we perform as a unit and seize those moments, nothing can stop us. Off the field, too, it’s going to be an exciting experience. With players like Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, and others around—some of the best in world cricket—I’ll learn a lot. It’s not just about playing matches; it’s also about making memories off the field. It’s going to be a great experience.The players are still arriving, but most of them are here. I met Stoinis—he’s a very down-to-earth and chilled-out person. I also had a few conversations with Ricky Ponting sir again. He’s extremely talented, gives players a lot of freedom, and is very aggressive on the field but completely relaxed off it. That’s the best part about him. He creates a great atmosphere for us, and we’re all looking forward to playing under his mentorship and coaching.Arshdeep is someone who gives his all every time. I met him yesterday for the first time since last year’s IPL, and he’s becoming smarter—both on and off the field. His approach to the game has evolved, and we can see that in his bowling for the national team. Winning the ICC award was a huge achievement for him. The way he bowled in the T20 World Cup, especially in the Caribbean, in both the powerplay and the death overs, was incredible. His growth has been phenomenal, and it’s all down to his hard work—his dedication in net sessions and fitness training. He’s cool-headed, fun to be around in the dressing room, and always joking. But on the field, he remains calm under pressure, which is one of his biggest strengths.I’m very happy for Yuzi. He is one of the smartest bowlers I’ve faced. I have played against many quality bowlers in my career, and Yuzi stands out. I’ve spoken to him in the nets—he’s a thinking cricketer, and his skill level is top-notch. He has done exceptionally well for both the national team and in franchise cricket. There’s no doubt in my mind that he’ll continue to perform. He will be a key asset, especially in the middle overs for Punjab Kings. Watching him bowl in the nets, I can see how eager he is for the upcoming season.We all know about Maxwell’s power. On any given day, he’s a nightmare for bowlers. His innings against Afghanistan in the 2023 ODI World Cup was a prime example, along with several other performances. In the middle overs, Maxi can completely change the game on his day. Bowling-wise, Yuzi’s form has been outstanding, and if the Mullanpur wickets assist him, he’ll be lethal. Having experienced players like Maxi and Yuzi is crucial in the IPL. Young talent is important, but experience at this level makes a big difference. On their day, these two can single-handedly win matches.Last year, with God's grace and everyone's blessings, things went well. This year, it's a fresh season. So, when you step onto the field, your aim is always to win matches for your team, and that’s what I'll try to do. Sometimes you succeed, sometimes you don’t, but you always learn. I’ll give my best for the team—it’s not about any individual or personal goals, it's about taking the team across the line.Off the field, at times, things do affect you. But on the field, whether you're a Rs 30 crore player or a Rs 10 lakh player, it doesn’t matter. It’s just your bat, your ball, and your game. Off the field, people do talk, and sometimes, it can get to you. But as a professional, you need to handle it. Once you step onto the field and enter match mode, all these things hardly matter. The only thing that counts is how you contribute to your team’s victory.Last year, I was at base price, but my intensity will remain the same this year. Obviously, I’ll try to be smarter—learn from my mistakes, reduce them, and improve. I won’t say I'll be perfect, but I’ll work on minimising my errors and focus on winning games for the team.The retention process didn’t take much time. To be honest, I was busy with the domestic season, and there were just two or three calls. It was never about money. They knew the role I wanted, and I knew what they had in mind for me. The discussion was more about my role in the team rather than the financial aspect. I have an emotional connection with the franchise because of the trust they showed in me last year. They gave me opportunities, and I was extremely happy. Now, with the IPL just a week away, I’m really excited to be back in an environment where I feel comfortable. My goal remains the same—to give my best and win games for the team.T20 cricket is unpredictable, and your batting position can change based on the situation. Anywhere between No. 4 and No. 7, I have to be ready. Technically, I have worked on a few shots, but I’m not sure if I’ll start using them from game one. The IPL is a long tournament, with 14 league matches and knockouts, so I’ll first focus on settling in before experimenting. T20 is all about adapting. Some situations demand high-risk shots, while others require calculated cricket. Some wickets are suited for boundaries, others for six-hitting. It depends on multiple factors. Ultimately, my main goal is to win games for the team. I’ll work on avoiding the mistakes I made last season, especially in the IPL, and aim to improve my game.Ashu did really well for Punjab Kings, but now he’s with a new franchise, and I wish him all the best. However, when you look at our middle order this year, we have players who can step into his role. Someone like Suryansh Shedge, and even Priyansh Arya in the top order. There's a lot of talent in our team, and I’m looking forward to building partnerships with them. It will be great to share the dressing room with such talented players.","Punjab Kings are chasing their first IPL title under new skipper, Shreyas Iyer.

IPL: Delhi Capitals will win trophy this year, says Abishek Porel

IPL 2025 | It is exciting to be back with KL Rahul: Karun Nair

How much distance will teams travel in

Team Distance (kms) Sunrisers Hyderabad 8,536 Delhi Capitals 9,270 Lucknow Super Giants 9,747 Gujarat Titans 10,405 Mumbai Indians 12,702 Rajasthan Royals 12,730 Kolkata Knight Riders 13,537 Punjab Kings 14,341 Chennai Super Kings 16,184 Royal Challengers Bengaluru 17,084

New Delhi: During the recently concluded Champions Trophy , current and former players were left miffed by the fact that India played all their matches in Dubai. The team were stationed at one hotel, practiced at single facility, played at one venue and eventually, went on to win the tournament.The situation arose after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) didn't get the permission to travel to designated hosts Pakistan due to safety reasons. After talks between BCCI, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and International Cricket Council (ICC), a hybrid model was agreed upon with India's matches taking place in Dubai while rest played their fixtures in Rawalpindi, Lahore and Karachi.As it panned out, India, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa were all in Dubai ahead of the semi-final as Group A went down to the wire. With India beating New Zealand in the final group game, South Africa and New Zealand returned to Pakistan for the semi-final.The scheduling and logistics meant South Africa flew to Dubai the morning after their last round robin fixture, reached the UAE in the afternoon and after ascertaining their fate, were preparing for flight back less than 12 hours after landing.David Miller highlighted this travel nightmare after their exit. ""It's only an hour and 40 minute flight, but the fact that we had to do that was not ideal,"" Miller said after South Africa's 50-run defeat to New Zealand.""It's early morning, it's after a game and we had to fly. Then we got to Dubai at 4:00 pm. And at 7.30 am we had to come back. It doesn't make it nice. It's not like we flew five hours, and we had enough time to recover and recuperate, but it was not an ideal situation still.""Over the course of next eight weeks, cricketers will do much of that during the Indian Premier League (IPL). All 10 IPL teams will play 14 games - seven at home and seven away. In effect they will play at eight different venues. The exceptions to this are Delhi Capitals, Rajasthan Royals and Punjab Kings, who will play at nine venues. DC, RR and PBKS have second homes venues in Visakhapatnam, Guwahati and Dharamsala.DC, who will be chasing their first IPL title, now led by Axar Patel, will travel the second-shortest distance of the 10 teams. Where Royal Challengers Bengaluru, another maiden title chasers, will travel over 17,000 kms in the league stage alone, DC will fly 9,270kms around the country - second only to Sunrisers Hyderabad (8500-plus kms.)As Miller's recounting of the events can suggest, life of an IPL cricketer is taxing beyond the regular challenges of the cricket field. It involves playing a match, packing, flying the next day, practice and then getting ready for the next fixture with very little turnaround time.""This is all mental. If you look at it in a toxic way, it will look toxic. If you enjoy it, you'd consider it a daily routine,"" said DC's Abhishek Porel to a query by TimesofIndia.com. ""You need to know when to enter game mode, to switch on and when to enter chill mode.""""For us, it is a practice that we undertake throughout the year. It is normal. There's a match, then travel and then match again. It happens all the time.""His teammate Karun Nair, who played a starring role in Vidarbha's Ranji Trophy title success, concurred with Porel.""I think all of us are playing the game that we love. I don't think we should have any complaints about travel. All of us have played enough to understand these things come with playing cricket at this level. I am sure that everyone is prepared to do whatever it takes and be ready for the games that are the most important things,"" said Nair.","All 10 IPL teams will play 14 games - seven at home and seven away.

IPL mega auction: Finally! R Ashwin returns to Chennai Super Kings

In a pre-season promotional ad, Sanju Samson is seen telling MS Dhoni that a new 13-year-old boy in the Rajasthan Royals squad will win an IPL title before the Chennai Super Kings legend retires! The tongue-in-cheek comment will resonate with fans.“Will this be Dhoni’s last IPL?” That’s a question around which a cottage industry has sprung up over the last few IPL seasons. There’s no definitive answer to that question yet. No one exactly knows when it’s going to happen. And by now, Dhoni himself has started enjoying this cat-and-mouse game. He loves to come up with cryptic comments about his “last few years in cricket” here and there, sending everyone in a tizzy.After his international retirement way back in Aug 2020, the 43-year-old’s batting prowess has been understandably on the wane. His body, quite clearly, struggles to take the wear and tear of the two-month grind that is the IPL. In the last two years, he mostly restricted himself to 10-ball cameos, in which he looked to clear the fence.While he has struggled to manoeuvre the strike against spinners in the middle overs, his knees are not good enough to go for those super-quick singles that he was a master of in his prime.But then, that’s just part of the narrative. The IPL is not just about batting, bowling or fielding skills. Dhoni, though, remains a magnificent wicketkeeper. His experience and subtle fielding changes play a massive role. There’s absolutely no doubt nobody understands the on-field dynamics in an IPL game better than Dhoni.The topic of Dhoni’s restricted game-time often comes up in conversations with Chennai Super Kings officials. Their standard reply is, “You can never buy experience in the market. It’s up to Dhoni to decide when he wants to go.”There’s one thing, however, that needs to be made clear — Dhoni doesn’t allow himself to be a liability on the field. If we look at his IPL 2024 stats, we will see that he has scored only 167 runs in 14 games, but his average is 53.66 and strike-rate a ridiculous 220.54.In fact, the fear factor that Dhoni still generates at the back-end of an innings is unmatched. If we go back to CSK ’s last game against RCB in 2024, Dhoni almost pulled off a miracle chasing a huge score, until the ball had to be changed when a six that he hit off left-arm pacer Yash Dayal in the 20th over vanished outside the ground. The new ball was dry and hard, Dayal got some extra bounce and induced an edge off Dhoni’s bat that finished CSK’s hopes of qualifying for the playoffs.Had CSK made the last-four stage, there was a possibility that it could have been Dhoni’s final IPL outing. The qualifier and the final were in Chennai and Dhoni would have got a chance to keep a promise that he had made to his fans a few years ago: “I will play my last IPL match at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.” Dhoni doesn’t always make promises, but if he does, he tries to keep them.The IPL management, too, has played its part to ensure Dhoni gets a shot at fulfilling his promise. They tweaked a retention rule, allowing a player who retired from international cricket five years ago to be retained for Rs 4 crore ahead of the big auction. The beneficiary, obviously, was CSK and Dhoni.The legend, though, is trying his best to be in the best shape for this IPL. He was one of the first to arrive in Chennai about a month ago and has been training hard. The news that filters out of the camp suggests that his body is in better shape than where it was last year. The batting, too, isn’t going badly.New CSK captain Ruturaj Gaikwad , too, has settled in well and there seems to be a core in place for the next few years. Still, Dhoni remains the ‘super boss’ of the team. Come the 19th over of a tight game, it will still be MSD making those field changes and Gaikwad will probably man the long-off boundary.Not that the CSK diehards will mind one bit. It’s a love story that they don’t want to end, come what may.","MS Dhoni's batting prowess has been understandably on the wane. His body, quite clearly, struggles to take the wear and tear of the two-month grind that is the IPL.

CSK SQUAD FOR IPL 2025

NEW DELHI: When discussing title contenders in the IPL, the name Chennai Super Kings (CSK) inevitably rises to the top, thanks to their on-field dominance and a record five titles. With IPL 2025 set to commence on March 22 and CSK kicking off their campaign against fellow five-time champions Mumbai Indians on March 23 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, all eyes will be on the Yellow Army and their iconic leader Mahendra Singh Dhoni.CSK's dominance can be attributed to the legendary Dhoni, under whose captaincy the team has secured five titles, reached the final ten times, and advanced to the playoffs on 12 occasions.After finishing as runners-up in the inaugural 2008 season, CSK made it to the semifinals in 2009. The following two years, 2010 and 2011, saw them clinch back-to-back titles, establishing their supremacy.In 2012 and 2013, CSK reached the finals but fell short, losing to Kolkata Knight Riders and Mumbai Indians, respectively. In 2014, they missed out on the final after being defeated by Punjab Kings (then Kings XI Punjab) in Qualifier 2.CSK's resurgence came in 2015 when they reached the final once again, only to lose to Mumbai Indians. However, the team faced a major setback when they were suspended from the IPL for two years (2016 and 2017) due to the 2013 IPL spot-fixing and betting scandal.The suspension did not diminish CSK's spirit. They returned triumphantly in IPL 2018, winning the title. In 2019, they narrowly missed out on the championship, losing to Mumbai Indians by just one run in a thrilling final.In 2020, CSK experienced their first failure to qualify for the playoffs, exiting after the league stage. However, they rebounded strongly in 2021 to claim their fourth title.The 2022 season saw another setback as CSK once again failed to reach the playoffs. Yet, they staged a remarkable comeback in 2023, clinching their fifth title.The 2024 season marked a significant change as Dhoni handed over the captaincy to Ruturaj Gaikwad . Unfortunately, the transition did not yield the desired results, as CSK faced an early exit, finishing fifth in the league stage with seven wins and seven losses, amassing 14 points.As IPL 2025 approaches, the burning question remains: Can CSK add a sixth trophy to their decorated cabinet?CSK have consistently checked all the boxes heading into tournaments, which explains their sustained dominance over the years.With the strategic brilliance of Dhoni still in the squad, CSK boast a formidable top-order lineup featuring New Zealand batting stars Rachin Ravindra and Devon Conway, along with the experienced Rahul Tripathi. Staying true to their tradition of prioritising all-rounders, CSK have once again picked a solid side, including Shivam Dube, Deepak Hooda, Vijay Shankar, Ravindra Jadeja, Sam Curran, and Ravichandran Ashwin.CSK's bowling attack also appears well-balanced, with the likes of Jamie Overton, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Khaleel Ahmed, Shreyas Gopal, Matheesha Pathirana, Mukesh Choudhary, Nathan Ellis, and Noor Ahmad.The only chink in CSK's armour seems to be their captaincy.Ruturaj Gaikwad, who was entrusted with the leadership role in IPL 2024, fell short of expectations as CSK finished fifth in IPL 2024 with seven wins and as many losses.CSK will be hoping that Ruturaj can put the 2024 disappointment behind him and lead the team with fiery determination to secure their sixth title.Devon Conway/Rachin Ravindra*, Ruturaj Gaikwad (capt), Rahul Tripathi, Deepak Hooda/Vijay Shankar, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Sam Curran*, MS Dhoni (wk), R Ashwin, Noor Ahmad/Nathan Ellis*, Matheesha Pathirana*, Khaleel Ahmed (*denotes overseas player)Devon Conway, Rachin Ravindra, Ruturaj Gaikwad (capt), Rahul Tripathi, Deepak Hooda, Vijay Shankar, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Sam Curran, MS Dhoni (wk), R Ashwin, Noor Ahmad, Nathan Ellis, Matheesha Pathirana, Khaleel Ahmed, C Andre Siddarth, Vansh Bedi, Shaik Rasheed, Ramakrishna Ghosh, Shreyas Gopal, Anshul Kamboj, Gurjapneet Singh, Mukesh Choudhary, Kamlesh Nagarkoti","Chennai Super Kings (CSK) have won a record five IPL titles.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

NEW DELHI: India cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has praised the incredible depth of Indian cricket following the team's unbeaten run to the 2025 Champions Trophy title, achieved even without ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah . Reflecting on the triumph, Gavaskar made a bold claim that no individual player is indispensable in the current Indian lineup — not even veteran batters Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma Writing in his column for Mid-Day, Gavaskar remarked, ""The triumph in the Champions Trophy and that too without Bumrah also emphasises that nobody is indispensable in this game. In the past too, India has won without Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, but there’s not the slightest doubt that their presence in the team gives the team an even more invincible look.""Gavaskar lauded Team India ’s resilience after bouncing back from a dismal Test series defeat against Australia to clinch victory in the England T20Is and ODIs, followed by the Champions Trophy. He noted how the team’s ability to triumph without their key players showcased the immense talent pool in Indian cricket.""Very seldom has a team depended on one individual like the Indians depended on Jasprit Bumrah in Australia, and his absence from the bowling attack to defend the small target set by India tilted the scales Australia’s way,"" Gavaskar said. ""For the Indian team to bounce back the way they did with comprehensive wins in the ODI and T20 series against England that were played on the team’s return to India tells volumes of the talent that Indian cricket has.""The cricketing great also acknowledged the support from overseas players, who admitted that India would have emerged victorious regardless of the location, dismissing claims that the Dubai setting played a decisive role. ""It is good to see so many overseas cricketers now coming up and saying India would have won anyway wherever they played and not only because they were stationed in Dubai,"" Gavaskar added.Gavaskar’s remarks reflect a sense of confidence in the current Indian setup, asserting that while legends like Kohli and Rohit undeniably elevate the team, the core strength lies in the depth and talent of the entire squad.","India cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has praised the incredible depth of Indian cricket following the team's unbeaten run to the 2025 Champions Trophy title.

Can Shreyas Iyer and Ricky Ponting finally bring PBKS their maiden IPL title?

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings have experienced a rollercoaster journey in the Indian Premier League (IPL) since the tournament's inception in 2008. Despite boasting star-studded squads over the years, consistency has been their biggest challenge.The franchise, formerly known as Kings XI Punjab, delivered their best performance in 2014 when they reached the final but lost to Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) by three wickets in the title clash.Since then, the team has struggled to progress beyond the league stage.Determined to change their fortunes, Punjab Kings made bold moves in the IPL 2025 Mega Auction where they splurged on marquee players like Shreyas Iyer, Marcus Stoinis, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Lockie Ferguson and Yuzvendra Chahal.The franchise has now handed the captaincy to Iyer, hoping his leadership will guide them to their first-ever IPL title . Iyer played a pivotal role in leading KKR to their third title in 2024, ending a decade-long wait.One of Punjab’s promising young talents, Prabhsimran Singh , who was retained for Rs 4 crore ahead of IPL 2025, believes Iyer could be the team’s lucky charm this season.The youngster is optimistic that Punjab Kings will finally claim their maiden IPL title in 2025.""Shreyas has been an amazing leader.

He has played most of his matches under former captain Shikhar Dhawan 's leadership.""I have played a lot of cricket under Shikhar Paaji (Dhawan). He is the one who has backed me a lot. There have been occasions when he has given me batting tips and taught me how to maintain my temperament on the field. I’ve learned a lot from him. Being an opener himself, he understands me well. He often says, ‘Always give your team a good start,’ and I always follow that,"" the right-hander said.""In IPL, I will do my best to provide my team with strong starts. Shikhar Paaji has supported me immensely, and I’ll always be thankful for what he has done for me.

Since a horror season as Mumbai Indians' (MI) captain last year, Hardik Pandya 's life on the field has turned around in remarkable fashion, landing him the honour of being part of India's triumphant T20 World Cup and ICC Champions Trophy teams. And the star all-rounder is ready to extend that turnaround to the upcoming Indian Premier League IPL ) season, where he would want to leave a forgettable last-place finish in 2024 behind and lead the team by example.MI will open their campaign this season against fellow five-time winners Chennai Super Kings in Chennai on Sunday.The negative response Hardik encountered in IPL 2024 stemmed from the franchise's choice to appoint him as captain, succeeding fan-favourite Rohit Sharma, who had steered the team to five titles. Those jeers escalated after MI finished at the bottom of the league table.""For me, it has always been about never leaving the battlefield. There have been phases in my career where my focus wasn't necessarily on winning but on surviving and holding my ground,"" Hardik said while talking to 'JioHotstar' ahead of the IPL starting March 22.""I realised that no matter what was happening around me, cricket would always be my greatest ally...I kept pushing through, and when all the hard work finally paid off, it was beyond anything I could have scripted.""The six-month phase where we won the (T20) World Cup, and then the kind of love and support I received upon returning -- it was a complete 360-degree turnaround for me,"" the 31-year-old Hardik added.""I didn't know exactly when that would happen, but as they say, destiny had its plan, and in my case, everything changed within two and a half months.""He had a message for the youngsters, urging them to be patient with themselves whatever the situation.""...Believe in yourself...the biggest challenge at this stage is self-doubt. Sometimes, players start questioning whether they belong at this level, and that doubt can take away from their skill set. Managing that mental aspect is crucial,"" he said.""In this game, there will be highs and lows. The key is to remain balanced, not just for one season but throughout their careers.""Hardik made significant contributions alongside Mohammed Shami, particularly with the new ball, during India's successful Champions Trophy campaign, while Jasprit Bumrah was unavailable.Despite MI's disappointing performance in the 2024 IPL season, Hardik expressed confidence in the team's prospects. He believes that MI managed to assemble a balanced squad at the mega auction last November.""Having played in the IPL for almost 11 years now, each season brings new energy and fresh positivity. The 2024 season was undoubtedly challenging for us as a group, but it also provided invaluable lessons,"" the MI captain said.""We analysed those learnings and applied them while building our team for 2025. This time, we have assembled an experienced squad -- players who have played a lot of cricket at the highest level. That in itself is exciting.""Playing in the IPL in Mumbai, particularly at Wankhede, can be intimidating due to the high-scoring nature of the pitch. We wanted bowlers with experience, pace, and the ability to generate swing and bounce. I believe we have put together a well-balanced team, one that meets all our requirements from top to bottom. Now it's about turning up and delivering on the field,"" he added.","Hardik Pandya has been named in India's triumphant T20 World Cup and ICC Champions Trophy teams.

Lucknow Supergiants IPL Auction Review: LSG go big on building solid Indian core under Rishabh Pant

Lucknow: With pacers Avesh Khan , Mayank Yadav and Akash Deep conspicuously missing in training sessions, the pace contingent of Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG ) is facing injury concerns ahead of the IPL season beginning this weekend.Akash Deep is missing from the camp preceding the opening fixture against Delhi Capitals on March 24. His previous stint with RCB yielded 7 wickets across eight matches in three seasons.Akash Deep hasn’t joined the LSG practice sessions yet, though he was spotted at a preparatory camp a month ago.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Premier League (IPL) has been a launchpad for many of today’s cricketing superstars, particularly in Indian cricket. Each season introduces fresh talent eager to make a mark, and IPL 2025 is no exception. Several uncapped players will be aiming to seize their opportunities and take their careers to the next level.Robin Minz was set to make his IPL debut last season with Gujarat Titans, but a road accident delayed his dreams. Now, the 22-year-old Jharkhand wicketkeeper-batter gets a fresh start with Mumbai Indians, who secured him for Rs 65 lakh—more than double his base price of Rs 30 lakh. Minz has shown glimpses of his explosive batting, boasting a staggering T20 strike rate of 181. Though he has only played six innings so far, his hard-hitting ability makes him a player to watch.One of India’s breakout domestic stars in 2024, Suryansh Shedge announced himself on the big stage with a match-winning knock in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy final. Mumbai, chasing 175 against Madhya Pradesh, were in trouble at 129/5 when Shedge turned the game around with a blistering 36* off 15 balls, including three fours and four sixes. He also dismissed Venkatesh Iyer in the same match.Shedge finished the tournament with 131 runs in nine innings at an astonishing strike rate of 251.92, averaging 43.66. He also took eight wickets at an average of 23. With solid performances in the Vijay Hazare Trophy and Ranji Trophy, he now has a golden opportunity to impress in the IPL. Punjab Kings acquired him for his base price of ?30 lakh.One of the biggest surprises at last year’s IPL mega auction was Rajasthan Royals signing 13-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi for Rs 1.1 crore. The Bihar-born prodigy became the youngest-ever IPL player and already boasts several records at the junior level.He made his first-class debut for Bihar in January 2024 at just 12 years and 284 days old. Last year, he made headlines by scoring a 58-ball century for India U-19 against Australia U-19 in Chennai. He was also the seventh-highest run-getter in the ACC Under-19 Asia Cup 2024-25, scoring 176 runs in five matches, including a top score of 76*. While he is still at the start of his career, Suryavanshi’s raw talent makes him a fascinating prospect.Nephew of Tamil Nadu stalwart S Sharath, 18-year-old C Andre Siddarth has already made an impression in red-ball cricket. He was one of the standout performers in the Ranji Trophy, amassing 612 runs in 12 innings at an impressive average of 68.00, with one century and five fifties.Though he has yet to play an official T20 match, Siddarth has featured in the Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL), where he displayed his all-round skills. It remains to be seen if he can replicate his Ranji Trophy success in the fast-paced format of the IPL.The only overseas player on this list, Bevon Jacobs, is a Pretoria-born cricketer who has represented New Zealand domestic sides Auckland and Canterbury. Despite having played just six T20 innings when Mumbai Indians signed him for Rs 20 lakh, his strike rate of 189 at the time caught the franchise’s attention.In 20 T20 matches, Jacobs has accumulated 423 runs in 17 innings at an average of 32.53 and a strike rate of over 148, with two fifties and a highest score of 90*. His ability to score quickly makes him an exciting addition to Mumbai Indians' power-packed lineup.","The Indian Premier League (IPL) has been a launchpad for many of today’s cricketing superstars.

NEW DELHI: The 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL) season is gearing up to showcase an exciting lineup of fresh talent, with players from diverse backgrounds making their debut in the tournament.The 18th edition of the cash-rich league kicks off on March 22 and will feature 74 matches across 13 venues, including 12 double-headers, before culminating on May 25.Here’s a look at some of the most exciting newcomers who are stepping into the IPL spotlight after making waves in domestic, youth, and international cricket.Rajasthan Royals made headlines by securing teenage prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi for Rs 1.1 crore during the mega auction, making the 13-year-old the youngest player in IPL history.The Bihar-born batter grabbed attention after smashing 104 off just 62 balls for India U-19 in a youth Test against Australia U-19 in Chennai. His century was the fastest ever recorded by an Indian in youth Tests and the second-fastest overall.Suryavanshi had already made history by debuting in the Ranji Trophy for Bihar at just 12, becoming the youngest player in India’s premier first-class tournament. He also became the youngest-ever cricketer to represent India at the U-19 level.His talent was on full display at the ACC U19 Asia Cup 2024, where he scored a blazing 67 off 36 balls in the semifinal, following up on his unbeaten 76 off 46 balls against UAE.The records kept tumbling as Suryavanshi became the youngest Indian to play List-A cricket during the Vijay Hazare Trophy 2024-25, surpassing the previous record held by Ali Akbar, who debuted at 14 years and 51 days in 1999-2000.Delhi's explosive opener Priyansh Arya earned a Rs 3.8 crore contract with Punjab Kings after a stellar run in the inaugural Delhi Premier League (DPL), where he topped the run charts with 608 runs in ten innings for South Delhi Superstarz.Arya turned heads when he smashed six sixes in an over during the tournament, cementing his reputation as a destructive batter.He was also Delhi’s leading run-scorer in the 2023-24 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, accumulating 222 runs in seven innings at an average of 31.71 and a strike rate of 166.91. Despite being shortlisted for the IPL 2024 auction, he went unsold—a situation he has now turned around with his performances.New Zealand’s uncapped batting sensation Bevon Jacobs joins Mumbai Indians after a remarkable 157-run knock for Auckland against Central Districts in the Plunket Shield 2024-25.Jacobs made an instant impact on debut, scoring a blistering 42 off 20 balls for Canterbury in the Super Smash 2023-24 curtain-raiser. His reputation grew further when he registered fifties in both innings of his maiden first-class match for Auckland.The 22-year-old also boasts a T20 century, having smashed 100 off 40 balls for South Brisbane in the Queensland T20 Max competition.He finished among the top five run-getters in the Super Smash 2024-25 and has been a consistent performer in the Ford Trophy. So far, he has accumulated 423 T20 runs in 20 matches, with a highest score of 90*.Australian wicketkeeper-batter Josh Inglis arrives at IPL 2025 as one of the most in-form players in the tournament. Punjab Kings secured him for Rs 2.6 crore in the mega auction.Inglis made waves with a century on his ODI debut, guiding Australia to a thrilling chase of 352 against England in the Champions Trophy. He followed it up with a Test century on debut in Galle, joining an elite group of Australians with international centuries across all three formats.One of his two T20I centuries came against India in 2023, where he tore through a bowling attack featuring several IPL stars, including his new teammate Arshdeep Singh.Inglis has played 29 T20Is, amassing 706 runs, with a career-best score of 110.One of the surprise signings of the mega auction, English all-rounder Jacob Bethell was picked up by Royal Challengers Bengaluru for Rs 2.6 crore. The left-handed batter, who also bowls left-arm orthodox spin, is seen as a potential replacement for Glenn Maxwell and Will Jacks, who were not retained after IPL 2024.Bethell has an explosive T20I strike rate of 167.96 and has been utilized in various batting roles, from opening to middle-order and even as a finisher in ODIs.His rapid rise in 2024 saw him make his T20I and ODI debuts against Australia, followed by a Test debut against New Zealand in Christchurch.Performances in the T20 Blast for Warwickshire and The Hundred for Birmingham Phoenix earned him England caps across all formats. His form also caught the attention of T20 franchises worldwide, leading to stints with Melbourne Renegades, Paarl Royals, and now RCB.Bethell registered his maiden Big Bash League half-century for Melbourne Renegades against Hobart Hurricanes in January, adding to his growing reputation as a dynamic all-rounder.","The 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL) kicks off on March 22 and will feature 74 matches across 13 venues. Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Priyansh Arya, Bevon Jacobs, Josh Inglis and Jacob Bethell are some of the most exciting newcomers.

Punjab Kings, one of the founding franchises of the Indian Premier League (IPL), continue their quest for a maiden title since their debut in 2008. Punjab have consistently struggled to find success in the league, only reaching the final once (in 2014) in their 17 attempts so far.Last season was yet another disappointment as they finished ninth, just ahead of Mumbai Indians. However, the franchise has made significant changes in a bid to finally claim the coveted trophy.The most notable change comes in the form of a new leader at the helm — Shreyas Iyer. Acquired for a staggering Rs 26.75 crore, Iyer takes over the captaincy after an impressive title-winning stint with Kolkata Knight Riders last season. His leadership qualities and proven record as a middle-order rock make him the ideal choice to spearhead Punjab’s campaign. Iyer’s presence in the batting lineup adds stability, while his ability to anchor and accelerate will be crucial for the team. They have also brought in Ricky Ponting as their new head coach.Punjab Kings have chosen to hit the reset button by retaining only two players from the previous season — dynamic wicketkeeper-batter Prabhsimran Singh and dependable all-rounder Shashank Singh. The franchise has assembled a balanced squad, blending explosive batting firepower with potent bowling resources. Glenn Maxwell , brought back to Punjab after stints with other franchises, will add firepower to the middle order, while Josh Inglis, the Australian wicketkeeper-batter, will provide flexibility in the batting unit.In the bowling department, Punjab boast one of the most well-rounded attacks in the league. Indian speedster Arshdeep Singh will lead the pace battery, joined by the express pace of Lockie Ferguson and the versatile Marco Jansen. The spin department is equally formidable, with veteran leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal and left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar offering control and wicket-taking ability. All-rounders like Marcus Stoinis and Azmatullah Omarzai further strengthen the lineup, providing depth in both batting and bowling.Prabhsimran Singh, Priyansh Arya, Shreyas Iyer (Captain), Shashank Singh, Azmatullah Omarzai, Glenn Maxwell, Marco Jansen, Arshdeep Singh, Lockie Ferguson, Yuzvendra Chahal, Harpreet BrarWith a rejuvenated squad and an inspirational leader in Shreyas Iyer, Punjab Kings look poised to challenge for the IPL title. The balance between explosive batting and lethal bowling makes them a force to be reckoned with. If they can overcome the perennial inconsistency that has plagued them in past seasons, this could be the year they finally break their title drought.","Punjab Kings are one of the founding franchises of the Indian Premier League (IPL) Punjab have consistently struggled to find success in the league, only reaching the final once (in 2014) in their 17 attempts so far.

Crossing 30 in India is considered like a crime: Sachin Baby,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/crossing-30-in-india-is-considered-like-a-crime-sachin-baby/articleshow/119168484.cms,"Sachin Baby (Image credit: X)

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

Kerala captain and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) batter Sachin Baby , who is set to feature in the IPL after four years, believes that crossing 30 is often treated as a crime in India, with sportspersons being written off too soon. He criticised this mindset, pointing out that in countries like Australia and England, many cricketers start playing professional cricket after turning 30.""If you look at football, we don’t call Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi veteran footballers. Instead, they are seen as sources of motivation. However, in India, players are branded as veterans far too easily,"" said the 36-year-old batter in an interaction with TOI.""I used to feel shy about revealing my age. If I was 34, I would say 33 instead. But that changed after I observed how MS Dhoni and 45-year-old Indian tennis star Rohan Bopanna carry themselves. Bopanna believes he is at 'level 45' rather than worrying about being 45 years old. He continues to dominate world tennis and achieve success without letting age bother him. Now, I proudly share my age. If any youngster can outmatch me in terms of fitness, they are welcome to call me a veteran. It all comes down to self-belief,"" he added.Baby described his four-year absence from the IPL as ""very difficult"" and felt his return to the tournament was long overdue.""I did things that nobody else did. I would start training at 5 AM and continue until 8. In the evening, I would focus on strength and running sessions. I worked extremely hard, scored big runs, and always believed that I just needed one opportunity to prove myself. So, this call-up is no surprise,"" said the SRH batter.Baby also credited Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni for pushing him beyond his limits and guiding him towards the right mental approach. The SRH batter played alongside Kohli in IPL 2016, 2017, and 2021.""Kohli made me believe that work ethic is everything. You have to be willing to make sacrifices. Due to his influence, I started training for five to six hours a day instead of just three. In IPL 2016, I batted at No. 6 for RCB—a position where you can either be a hero or a zero. To ensure more success in such situations, I kept working on my skills, and I am confident about giving my 120% if a similar situation arises,"" he said.""Dhoni, on the other hand, taught me to follow the process rather than obsessing over the outcome. Many cricketers make it to the IPL and immediately start chasing success, ignoring the process. However, to truly succeed, you need to dedicate yourself to long hours of practice, get proper rest, and avoid distractions,"" Baby added.",Sachin Baby is set to return to the IPL for the first time in four years. The 36-year-old believes that crossing 30 is often treated as a crime in India. Baby also credited Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni for pushing him.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119169916,imgsize-41442,width-400,resizemode-4/119169916.jpg"

Former KKR all-rounder and Punjab Kings (PBKS) captain Shreyas Iyer 's close friend, Aman Khan , credited Shreyas' immense self-confidence and belief through thick and thin as the key factors behind his success. The all-rounder cited Mumbai’s recent Vijay Hazare Trophy (VHT) 2024/25 match against Pondicherry as an example of Shreyas' mental strength and determination to dominate at any cost.""Shreyas and I were having dinner the night before the match. We were excited about facing off against each other competitively, as Shreyas was representing Mumbai while I was part of the Pondicherry setup. He said, 'I am gonna smash you guys tomorrow',"" Aman recalled during an interaction with TOI.""Sure enough, he delivered, scoring an unbeaten 137 off 133 balls against us. While the other Mumbai batters struggled, Shreyas lived up to his words,"" he added. Shreyas' unbeaten knock, which included 16 fours and four sixes, helped Mumbai post a total of 290 after being reduced to 82/5 at one stage.Aman, who played under Shreyas’ captaincy at KKR in IPL 2022, highlighted his unwavering confidence. ""From the very beginning, he was convinced that we would win the IPL. KKR hadn’t won the tournament in 10 years, but Shreyas always believed in the team and encouraged the players to believe in themselves. He’s not the kind of captain who yells or screams on the field, but his aggression in terms of dominating the opposition is undeniable,"" he said.""Yes, there were challenges along the way—Shreyas suffered an injury, and the setup changed across departments. However, his confidence remained unshaken, and that was evident in IPL 2024, where KKR secured a comprehensive league triumph,"" Aman added.Gujarat batter Priyank Panchal also praised Shreyas' skill and composure, recalling an India-A long-format match against New Zealand-A in 2017.""The conditions were quite challenging, with the ball bouncing and seaming. While other batters struggled to get bat on ball, Shreyas remained unfazed and smashed 108 off 97 balls. The New Zealand bowling attack featured top performers like Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, and Ish Sodhi, who did everything they could to make life difficult,"" Panchal said.""Shreyas has faced his fair share of challenges over the years—he wasn’t given a BCCI central contract, and there were question marks over his capabilities. But he never lost confidence, which was evident in his contributions to India’s success in the 2024 T20 World Cup and Champions Trophy. Even in something as simple as walking, you can see the confidence he carries. I am confident he has what it takes to end PBKS' trophy drought in the IPL,"" he added.","Former KKR all-rounder and Punjab Kings (PBKS) captain Shreyas Iyer's close friend, Aman Khan, has praised his immense self-confidence and belief.

It is simply a bitter pill to swallow for Pakistan, as he has withdrawn to play in the IPL. The relationship between both nations is not great to begin with,"" Henderson said in an interaction with TOI.""IPL is definitely the tournament to be a part of, considering it is the biggest T20 league in the world.

The inclusion of all-rounders like Mitchell Marsh and Aiden Markram provides balance to the squad. Shahbaz Ahmed adds a valuable spin-bowling option while contributing with the bat. Spin depth: Ravi Bishnoi remains a vital cog with his effective leg spin, while Shahbaz Ahmed complements him with left-arm orthodox. The combination offers LSG a balanced spin attack on subcontinental pitches.

Weaknesses

Fragile pace attack: LSG’s fast-bowling unit appears vulnerable with injury concerns. Key pacers Akash Deep, Avesh Khan, Mohsin Khan and Mayank Yadav are either recovering from injuries or yet to join the squad. This makes the pace department relatively inexperienced and susceptible to pressure.

One of the newest franchises in the Indian Premier League IPL ), Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) made a remarkable debut by qualifying for the playoffs in their first two seasons (2022 and 2023). However, the 2024 season proved to be a challenging one as they finished seventh in the standings with 14 points, narrowly missing out on the playoffs due to an inferior net run rate.Determined to bounce back stronger, LSG made significant changes to their squad ahead of the 2025 season.Despite retaining five core players from the previous campaign, LSG made a high-profile decision to part ways with their former captain KL Rahul , who moved to Delhi Capitals. In an ambitious move to rebuild the squad, LSG went all out to acquire star Indian wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant , breaking the league record with a staggering Rs 27 crore bid. Following his arrival, Pant was appointed as the new captain of the Lucknow-based franchise.Apart from Pant, LSG made several strategic additions to bolster their batting line-up, securing experienced internationals like David Miller, Aiden Markram and Mitchell Marsh. They also retained key players including Nicholas Pooran , Ravi Bishnoi, Mayank Yadav, Ayush Badoni and Mohsin Khan.

IPL 2025 Captains List: Who Will Lead Each Team This Season?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-team-captains/articleshow/119161683.cms,"Chennai Super Kings – Ruturaj Gaikwad Ruturaj Gaikwad was handed over the captaincy duties of the Chennai Super Kings by longtime skipper MS Dhoni ahead of IPL 2024. Ruturaj, who was bought by CSK during the 2018 season, and enjoyed a breakthough campaign in 2020, played a pivotal role in the team's title win in 2021.

Ahead of IPL 2024, Dhoni handed over the responsibility of leading the franchise to the 28-year-old. This was a big step for the team that had previously tried to shift the leadership duties to Ravindra Jadeja only for it to fall flat.

In his maiden IPL season as CSK captain, Gaikwad led the team to fifth spot and they missed out on a playoff spot.

Gujarat Titans – Shubman Gill

Following Hardik Pandya’s departure to Mumbai Indians in a trade that involved cash and a player, the 2022 IPL Champions roped in star opener Shubman Gill for the captaincy role. The stylish batter took over the job ahead of the 2024 season and will continue that job in 2025 as well.

As a batter, Gill had a fairytale IPL 2023. The right-hander won the Orange Cap after smashing 890 runs in 17 innings at an average of 59.33 with a strike rate of 157.8 featuring four 50s and three 100s.

In his first season as an IPL captain, Titans finished eighth in the 10-team table with five wins and seven defeats. They subsequently missed out on a playoff spot. With the bat he could only muster 426 runs at an average of 38.73 and strike rate of 147.40.

Mumbai Indians – Hardik Pandya

After leading the Gujarat Titans to a title win in their inaugural season, all-rounder Hardik Pandya returned to the Mumbai Indians for IPL 2024 in what was a blockbuster trade involving cash and a player swap. Making the whole exchange even more jaw-dropping was the fact that he went on to replace Rohit Sharma as the MI captain which resulted in plenty of criticism and public outrage by the Mumbai Indians faithful.

To make the big money make sense, Mumbai Indians also traded Australian all-rounder Cameron Green to the Royal Challengers Bangalore (INR 17.5 Crores).

His first season back was one to forget - individually and as a collective bunch for the five-time IPL champions. Mumbai finished bottom of the standings with just four wins from 14 matches and to make matters worse, the franchise was criticised for their decision to change captains and Pandya was jeered by fans everywhere he went.

Pandya has been captain in 45 IPL matches, winning 26 and losing 19 for a win-loss record of 1.36.

Punjab Kings – Shreyas Iyer

After missing out on IPL 2023 due to a back injury, Shreyas Iyer returned as the leader of the Kolkata Knight Riders and led them to their third title.

Before KKR, Iyer had led the Delhi Capitals in IPL 2018 where his leadership skills were lauded in their foray to the playoffs for three straight seasons. It was in IPL 2020 that DC reached the final. He then took over the captaincy armband at KKR with the big achievement coming in the 2024 edition.

During the 2025 season, Iyer would captain the Punjab Kings having not been retained by the KKR. Overall, Iyer has captained in 70 matches, winning 38, losing 29 and tying two.

Kolkata Knight Riders – Ajinkya Rahane

KKR have announced Ajinkya Rahane as their captain for the IPL 2025 season. The experienced batter, who was one of the nominees for the role, succeeds Shreyas Iyer, who led Kolkata to the IPL 2024 title. While many anticipated Rahane’s appointment, there was also speculation about KKR's ₹23.75 crore acquisition, Venkatesh Iyer, potentially being named captain. Ultimately, KKR entrusted Rahane with the leadership role.

During his previous captaincy with Rajasthans Royals in IPL 2018, Rahane guided the team to the playoffs but did not reach the final.

Overall, Rahane has captained 25 IPL matches from 2017 to 2019, leading Rajasthan Royals and Rising Pune Supergiant. His captaincy record includes 9 wins, 16 losses, and a win percentage of 36%.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru – Rajat Patidar

Rajat Patidar, 31, will lead the big ask of steering Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) to their first IPL title during the 2025 season. The decision follows the release of former captain Faf du Plessis.

Despite speculation surrounding a potential return of Virat Kohli as captain, RCB’s choice of Patidar demonstrates the franchise's commitment to a new direction in their leadership.

This will be Rajat Patidar’s first IPL captaincy role, although he previously led Madhya Pradesh in the 2024-25 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and Vijay Hazare Trophy. In these tournaments, he showcased his leadership capabilities, guiding his team to the finals in the SMAT 2024 and finishing third in group E of the Vijay Hazare Trophy, narrowly missing out on a quarter-final spot.

Having made his IPL debut in 2021, Patidar has played 27 matches for RCB and was retained by the franchise for Rs 11 crore prior to the 2025 mega auction.

Rajasthan Royals – Sanju Samson

Stylish Kerala wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson will continue to lead the Rajasthan Royals (RR) in the forthcoming IPL 2025.

Under Samson's guidance, Rajasthan Royals finished third in the points table - behind Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad. In the playoffs, they were bundled out by the SRH in the second qualifier.

On an individual level, Samson scored 531 runs in the season with five fifties to his name to emerge as the fifth-highest run-getter.

Sunrisers Hyderabad – Pat Cummins

After a wooden spoon under Aiden Markram, Sunrisers Hyderabad turned their attention to Australia's Pat Cummins going into IPL 2024. The franchise was almost immediately rewarded with a stunning batting show as they went hammer and tongs throughout the season. They were eventually stopped short by Kolkata Knight Riders in the final.

Prior to Cummins, SRH had back-to-back seasons of different captains with David Warner first and then Markram. Now, they will enter IPL 2025 with the Aussie in charge once again, even though he's been out of action with an ankle injury.

Cummins has captained in 16 matches in the IPL, winning nine and losing seven. All of these matches have come for SRH.

Lucknow Super Giants – Rishabh Pant

Rishabh Pant is the new captain in the Lucknow Super Giants camp and the wicketkeeper-batter will spearhead the side in IPL 2025. He had been acquired by the team for Rs 27 crore during the auction.

He will be the fourth captain in LSG's history, following KL Rahul, Nicholas Pooran, and Krunal Pandya.

This marks Pant's second term as an IPL captain; he previously led the Delhi Capitals from 2021 to 2024, excluding the 2023 season, which he missed due to injuries from a car accident in December 2022.

Pant's nine-year tenure with DC ended on October 31, just ahead of the IPL 2025 retention deadline, with his release attributed primarily to the leadership role.

Delhi Capitals – Axar Patel

Axar Patel has been named captain of the Delhi Capitals (DC) for IPL 2025. He has been with the team since 2019 and was their top retention for Rs 16.50 crore ahead of the mega auction. While his captaincy experience is limited, he was appointed India's T20I vice-captain.

At 31, Axar has led his state team, Gujarat, in 23 matches across various formats, including the 2024-25 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and Vijay Hazare Trophy. He previously captained DC in one IPL match last year — a crucial game against RCB that they lost, resulting in their failure to reach the playoffs — while Rishabh Pant, the previous skipper, was serving a ban for a slow over-rate.

With Pant's departure, Axar became DC's most experienced player, having participated in 82 games over six seasons. Last year, he scored 235 runs at an average of nearly 30 and took 11 wickets with an economy rate of 7.65.

Among the original eight IPL franchises, DC are one of three — along with Punjab Kings and Royal Challengers Bengaluru — that has yet to win a title. The team finished sixth last season, with an equal record of seven wins and seven losses.",Ruturaj Gaikwad was handed the captaincy of Chennai Super Kings by MS Dhoni ahead of IPL 2024.

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

NEW DELHI: Former India captain and 1983 World Cup-winning legend Kapil Dev has weighed in on the ongoing debate over cricketers’ families travelling during extended tours, calling for a balanced approach.The BCCI recently introduced a new policy following India’s 1-3 Test series loss to Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, restricting family presence on tours longer than 45 days. As per the guidelines, families can join players for up to 14 days on longer tours and just 7 days on shorter ones.""That's the cricket board's stance; mine is yes, you need family, but you also need the team all the time. In our time, we used to say to ourselves, not by the cricket board, that the first half should be about cricket; in the latter half, families should come and enjoy as well. It should be a blend,"" said Kapil, speaking on the sidelines of the Kapil Dev-Grant Thornton Invitational 2025 press conference at The Claridges, New Delhi, on Tuesday.The topic has spurred reactions from the current cricketers, with Indian batting stalwart Virat Kohli also voicing his perspective at the RCB Innovation Lab Summit in Bengaluru.""The contribution of family is hard to articulate to outsiders… how rejuvenating it is to return to your family after enduring something intense outside. I believe people often overlook the value it brings,"" Kohli had said. ""I prefer not to retreat to my room and sulk alone. I want to maintain a sense of normalcy. This way, you can view your game as a responsibility.""Kapil, also the president of the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI), was addressing the media ahead of the third edition of the Kapil Dev-Grant Thornton Invitational, which will be held from April 23 to 26 at the Prestige Golfshire in Bengaluru.The event will, for the first time, feature India’s top male and female golfers competing for the same prize purse of Rs 2 crore.Reflecting on the contrasting upkeep of cricket and golf venues, Kapil quipped, ""After I stopped playing cricket, I always used to say how come these greenkeepers keep the green so good. In the cricket ground, not even 2 acres, 3 acres, we still have patches. We still put colour there to cover that. But here we have 160 acres of land absolutely green, so cricket has a lot to learn from golf.""","The BCCI recently introduced a new policy following India’s 1-3 Test series loss to Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

But for him to go, 'you know what guys, I feel this is a bigger and better move for the future of RCB,' I think that’s fantastic,"" de Villiers added. ""Only time will tell, right? You’ll see how they operate as a team on the park and if Virat really has the back of Rajat Patidar.

(AP)

History for Newcastle

Newcastle ended their 56-year trophy drought in stunning style as Dan Burn and Alexander Isak sealed a 2-1 win against Liverpool in the League Cup final on Sunday.Eddie Howe 's side made history at Wembley with a superb display that left the runaway Premier League leaders shell-shocked.Burn put Newcastle ahead late in the first half and Isak's 27th goal in all competitions doubled their lead after the interval.Federico Chiesa got one back in the closing seconds, but Newcastle held on for their first major silverware since the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.That success in the predecessor to the Europa League is a relic of a bygone era, but this long-awaited triumph will be forever etched in the memories of the Newcastle fans who turned one half of Wembley into a roiling sea of black and white with their ecstatic celebrations.It was also Newcastle's first major domestic prize dating back 70 years to the 1955 FA Cup.Since the Magpies lifted the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, 30 different English teams had won silverware, while Liverpool had clinched 38 major trophies in that time.But after losing the 2023 League Cup final against Manchester United, Howe's team returned to Wembley and set the record straight at last.""We were well aware of the history and we wanted to do the club proud. We wanted to score, we wanted to perform and we wanted to win,"" Howe said.""We are breaking new ground. I thought we were magnificent today.""Newcastle had endured five relegations to the second tier since their last trophy, with club legends like Alan Shearer, Paul Gascoigne and Malcolm MacDonald failing to win silverware in their time on Tyneside.Aside from a brief period when Kevin Keegan's self-styled ""entertainers"" challenged for the title in the 1990s, Newcastle have endured decades of underachievement and self-inflicted wounds that rendered them a laughing stock for long periods.All that changed in 2021 when a Saudi-backed consortium completed a takeover from unpopular owner Mike Ashley and quickly hired Howe as their manager.Thanks to Howe's astute leadership and the Saudi financial backing, Newcastle have been transformed from relegation candidates to silverware winners.The defeat was another painful blow for Liverpool just days after their Champions League last 16 exit on penalties against Paris Saint-Germain.But despite failing to win their first trophy under boss Arne Slot, Liverpool still sit 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League, within touching distance of a record-equalling 20th English title.""It's a very disappointing result. The game went the way Newcastle wanted it. They deserved to win. We were out-played in their style. They won more aerial duels than us,"" Slot said.Liverpool are 23 points ahead of sixth-placed Newcastle in the league and hadn't lost to them for 17 games dating back to 2015.But Howe's men were in no mood to be cowed by past failuresNewcastle fans unveiled a banner before kick-off urging their team to ""write your name in the history books"".They rose to the challenge in spectacular fashion, snapping into tackles and counter-attacking with purpose, while Liverpool were sluggish and sloppy in possession.Newcastle's desire and drive was clear to see when Joelinton tracked back from midfield to stop Jarell Quansah in his tracks and celebrated with a fist-pumping roar.Despite nearly being caught out by Burn's aerial prowess earlier in the game, Liverpool failed to heed the warning as the towering centre-back put Newcastle ahead in the 45th minute.Bizarrely left unmarked, with only the diminutive Alex Mac Allister anywhere near him, Burn was allowed to rise unchallenged to meet Kieran Tripper's corner as he thumped a powerful header into far corner from 12 yards.Burn's goal -- Newcastle's first in a cup final since 1976 -- capped an incredible week for the journeyman centre-back, who received his first England call-up on Friday.With Liverpool talisman Mohamed Salah completely anonymous, the lethargic Reds had no answer as Isak put Newcastle into dreamland after 52 minutes.Newcastle dominated in the air again as Jacob Murphy met Tino Livramento's cross with a header that found Isak, who drilled a superb first-time finish past Caoimhin Kelleher from 10 yards.Chiesa's stoppage-time strike set up an anxious finale, but good things comes to those who wait.And all across Wembley, Newcastle players and fans celebrated with abandon as a party over half a century in the making got into full swing.",Newcastle beat Liverpool 2-1 in the League Cup final at Wembley Stadium.

Barcelona secured a dramatic 4-2 victory against Atletico Madrid after coming back from a two-goal deficit in Sunday's crucial Spanish league match .Lamine Yamal and Ferran Torres scored in stoppage time, helping Barcelona reclaim the top spot in the standings after Real Madrid had temporarily moved ahead following their win against Villarreal on Saturday.Barcelona and Real Madrid are now level on 60 points, with Barcelona holding a game in hand. Atletico Madrid sits four points behind the leaders following their home defeat against Hansi Flick's team, completing a disappointing week after their Champions League exit.""How we play, the confidence we have, it's really good to see. We will try everything to win trophies, the match today gives us more confidence,"" said Flick.Barcelona, who had previously suffered late setbacks against Atletico this season, turned the tables this time, extending their unbeaten run to 18 matches across all competitions.The match saw Julian Alvarez and Alexander Sorloth put Atletico ahead before Robert Lewandowski and Torres equalised for Barcelona, who ultimately secured victory in added time.""I think that after the anger, the feeling of impotence, not being comfortable in the game, we put our best foot forward and gave the best that we have. It was a very important game to win in the end, beating Atletico was a statement win, we put ourselves back as leaders having played a game fewer and we're very happy,"" Yamal told DAZN.Flick had earlier cautioned his players about maintaining focus, following a December incident where they conceded a 96th-minute goal to Atletico, losing their league lead in a 2-1 home defeat.Barcelona's first significant opportunity came near halftime when Pedri set up Lewandowski, whose powerful shot hit the crossbar.Atletico immediately capitalised on the subsequent goal kick, with Antoine Griezmann providing a brilliant pass to Giuliano Simeone, leading to Alvarez's opener.The goal provided some consolation for Alvarez, who had experienced disappointment earlier in the week when his penalty against Real Madrid was controversially disallowed during their Champions League elimination.Diego Simeone refreshed his team with substitutes following their Champions League exit, bringing on Sorloth and Conor Gallagher, who combined for Atletico's second goal.Griezmann played a crucial role in another well-executed team move, with Gallagher assisting Sorloth for his 11th league goal of the season.Barcelona quickly responded despite their protests about a Rodrigo De Paul handball being dismissed. Martinez launched an attack and found Lewandowski, who controlled well and scored.Torres then equalised after receiving a cross from Raphinha, before Yamal's deflected long-range effort put Barcelona ahead in stoppage time.""We have to congratulate our opponent, they had a good game and in the end were very effective with their chances. They had that bit of luck which you have to have, in the deflection for Yamal's goal for 3-2,"" said Simeone.Torres sealed the victory with his second goal in the closing moments.""It was a strange game because we did well in the first half, we had them under control and scored two goals... it's true the 120 minutes in the Champions League weighed on us, and in the end the team fell apart. We will fight to the end (for La Liga ), we have seen many times how things change, you have a good month and someone else has a bad one, and you turn it all around,"" said Atletico's Llorente.",Barcelona come from two goals down to beat Atletico Madrid 4-2 in La Liga. Lamine Yamal and Ferran Torres scored in stoppage time to secure victory.

Leicester set unwanted record

Chelsea 's bid for a Champions League spot weakened following their lifeless 0-1 loss at Arsenal on Sunday, while Fulham secured a 2-0 victory against Tottenham. Manchester United continued their upward trend with a 3-0 win at Leicester.A solitary goal from Mikel Merino settled an uninspiring match at the Emirates, helping Arsenal strengthen their second position and reduce Liverpool's advantage to 12 points.The absence of Cole Palmer through illness proved costly for Chelsea, who delivered a lacklustre performance that hampered their top-four aspirations.Despite maintaining fourth position presently, Chelsea face pressure from five clubs between Manchester City in fifth and Aston Villa in ninth, all within four points of Enzo Maresca's side.Arsenal's goalscoring difficulties have persisted since Kai Havertz's season-ending injury forced midfielder Merino to adopt a forward position. The Spanish international proved decisive from a corner, heading in Martin Odegaard's delivery at the far post after 20 minutes.Whilst Chelsea created few chances, they nearly equalised when David Raya mishandled Marc Cucurella's attempt, with the ball rolling wide.Robert Sanchez produced an excellent save to prevent Merino from scoring Arsenal's second, in what was the half's finest attempt.The match concluded quietly with minimal attacking threat, as the subdued display intensified criticism of Maresca's tactical approach amongst Chelsea supporters.""We did enough to deserve to win the game,"" said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta. ""Now we have the international break so let's take a chance to breathe and bring some players back hopefully.""Tottenham, fresh from their Europa League quarter-final qualification against AZ Alkmaar on Thursday, experienced another post-European setback at Craven Cottage.Fulham's triumph elevates Marco Silva's team to eighth position, four points from fourth place and three behind fifth.A fifth-place finish should secure Champions League participation next season, owing to English clubs' strong European performances.Spurs have struggled with their Premier League form following European fixtures, winning just three of 10 league matches after Europa League games.Ange Postecoglou's team were second-best throughout, conceding in the 78th minute when Rodrigo Muniz converted Andreas Pereira's pass. Ryan Sessegnon sealed the victory against his previous club with an elegant finish.""It's been a difficult campaign for sure,"" said Spurs captain Son Heung-min.""But I feel we've lost too many games that we should have got stuff out of, and this was one of those games.""United extended their unbeaten streak in open play to seven matches with a convincing win over a struggling Leicester side.Rasmus Hojlund broke his 21-game goal drought by scoring to put United ahead in the 28th minute.Alejandro Garnacho had to be patient for his first goal since November, having been flagged offside early in the second half. However, he eventually found the net with a quick shot that Mads Hermansen should have saved.This victory marked United’s fourth win against Leicester this season, including two matches where Ruud van Nistelrooy served as the interim manager for the Red Devils. Unfortunately for the Dutchman, he hasn't achieved the same success at the King Power Stadium.Leicester's situation has worsened, suffering 13 losses in their last 14 league games and now sitting nine points behind safety. Additionally, they set an unwanted record as the first Premier League team to go seven home games without scoring.Bruno Fernandes capped off United's victory with a brilliant strike from the edge of the box, marking his seventh goal in as many games.",Arsenal beat Chelsea 0-1 at the Emirates. Fulham beat Tottenham 2-0 at Craven Cottage. Manchester United beat Leicester 3-0.

PANAJI: Whenever Diego Godin closes his eyes and thinks of that magical night of May 17, 2014, at the Camp Nou, the former Atletico de Madrid defender remembers every scene almost perfectly.The frenzied start by hosts Barcelona , a lightning strike from Alexis Sanchez to put the home team ahead and the inspirational half-time talk from his team’s manager, Diego Simeone.It was the concluding clash of La Liga , and having lost the chance to wrap up the Spanish league title earlier, Atletico needed at least a point at the Camp Nou with Barca also chasing the title. Both Diego Costa and Arda Turan were taken off injured in the first 45 minutes. Then, as ends were changed, Godin powered a header from Koke’s corner to put Atletico level and eventually end the duopoly in Spanish football .It was their first league title in 18 years and the first time in ten years anyone outside Barcelona and Real Madrid had had a taste of it.“It wasn’t easy for us to win that championship at the Camp Nou,” Godin, now retired, said during a global media call arranged by La Liga on Saturday. “There were so many emotions, so much joy. If I have to handpick my best memory from my time at Atletico, the key moment was clearly that goal.”Since that 2014 triumph, Atletico have won La Liga just once, with Barcelona and Madrid taking turns to become champions. Now they have another chance as Barcelona visit the Wanda Metropolitano on Sunday. The Catalans are currently just one point ahead of the two Madrid clubs, with a game in hand.Defeat at Getafe last week put a massive dent in Atletico’s own title bid.“I wouldn’t say it’s a decisive clash but it’s an important one in the title race. If Atletico win, it will help the team a lot and lift their morale after their elimination from the Champions League (against rivals Real Madrid on penalties). Another defeat will be very hard to take,"" said Godin.“The (Champions League) defeat was very painful. It hurts more because Atletico were really enthusiastic and excited about going through (to the next stage). When you are eliminated from a competition where you’re so excited, you feel very empty (after a defeat).”Under Simeone, the former Uruguay captain and the country’s most capped footballer turned himself into a leader and the force around whom the team revolved. For nine years, he made close to 400 appearances, winning La Liga, two Europa Leagues, one Copa del Rey, one Spanish Super Cup and three UEFA Super Cups.Atletico also made it to the final of the Champions League twice, only to lose both times to bitter rivals Real Madrid.“When I joined, Atletico were a long way from Barcelona and Real Madrid but now it’s a team that can compete on equal terms. We’ve won leagues against them. We’ve got to the finals of Champions League, of Copa del Rey, the Super Cup.“So, you can imagine how the club has grown, and how the club continues to grow. It’s got better quality players, young players. The very equal competitiveness in sporting terms with Real and Barca is important. We cannot compete with them in terms of their finances, but in terms of sport, we can give them a fight,” said Godin.",Diego Godin won the La Liga title with Atletico de Madrid in May 2014. Godin scored the winning goal against Barcelona at the Camp Nou. Atletico have won La Liga just once since that triumph. Barcelona visit Atletico on Sunday in the final game of the season.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119065419,imgsize-91406,width-400,resizemode-4/119065419.jpg"

The Indian, who chose the rigour of the South American swing over the four-week ATP Challenger series in India in February, was caught unawares in Argentina.“If I knew I was (so) unwell I would never have gone to South America,” Nagal told TOI during a telephone interview. “You’re going so far away, not feeling your best, that makes no sense.”Nagal, who has spent the last few weeks at his training base in Germany, is gradually working his way back.“I never really felt good since Australia, it was maybe Covid-19 over there, I wasn’t sure,” the India No.1 said. “When I was in Argentina I was practicing a bit and then I wasn’t really practicing. It wasn’t a great few weeks for me. I was struggling so much with my health, I was fatigued, I was barely practicing. And when I practiced or played I would feel super tired.”“It has been good in the last two weeks. I have been practicing quite a bit, pushing a bit,” said Nagal, who marked his fitness at eight on a scale of 1 to 10.Nagal, who climbed to a career-high No.68 in the ranking last July, is now chasing a main draw berth at Roland Garros. He’s scheduled to play two ATP Challengers, followed by Monte Carlo Masters 1000, where he went through qualifiers last year to make the round of 32, after which the Indian will look at 250 Series tournaments.While there are nine Indians in the top-150 of the doubles rankings, Nagal is the only Indian in the top-250 of the singles rankings on the men’s and women’s tours.","Sumit Nagal will make a return to tournament play in the ATP Challenger in Murcia next week.

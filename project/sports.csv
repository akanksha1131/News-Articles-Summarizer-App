Poll Should India have accepted the Asia Cup trophy from the ACC chairman? Yes, they should have accepted it. No, they made the right decision.

DUBAI: What should have been a triumphant moment for Indian cricket descended into unprecedented controversy at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday, as the Asia Cup trophy presentation turned into a diplomatic standoff following India’s thrilling five-wicket victory over Pakistan.Rinku Singh’s match-winning runs sparked wild celebrations among the Indian contingent, with Tilak Verma’s magnificent unbeaten 69 earning him Player of the Match honours. But the jubilation was quickly overshadowed by an extraordinary post-match fiasco that saw the champions celebrating without their trophy.Following their defeat, the Pakistan team retreated to the dressing room and remained there for over an hour, while Indian players and coaching staff completed their broadcast duties. Asian Cricket Council (ACC) president Mohsin Naqvi — who also serves as Pakistan Cricket Board chairman and Pakistan’s interior minister -- and others then waited on the podium for almost 20 minutes for the trophy presentation to begin. As the delay stretched on, it emerged that the Indian team had refused to receive the trophy from Naqvi.India’s stance had been clear throughout the tournament — the team avoided handshakes and pleasantries with Pakistani players in all three encounters.The team is also believed to have been irked with Naqvi because of his recent social media posts, including one in which he posted a video of Cristiano Ronaldo making a 'crashing plane' gesture. He also reposted an image in which Pakistan cricketers Salman Agha and Shaheen Shah Afridi are seen wearing flight suits with images of airborne fighter jets in the background.The Indian team management categorically told ACC officials that they were ""not okay"" with receiving awards from Naqvi. This was conveyed to Naqvi immediately. However, Naqvi refused to budge and the Indian team also refused to walk up to the podium.The team did indicate that it was willing to accept the trophy and medals from Emirates Cricket Board vice-chairman Khalid Al Zarooni instead of Naqvi. However, the request was declined. Naqvi insisted on conducting the presentation himself. When it became clear he was not going to get his way, he ordered the trophy to be removed from the venue.Indian supporters greeted Naqvi’s arrival at the presentation stage with boos and chants of “Bharat Mata Ki Jai.” Pakistani players, particularly fast bowlers Haris Rauf and Shaheen Shah Afridi, were also jeered by the crowd.When the Pakistan team was called to collect the runners-up medals, Naqvi initially refused to take part. Bangladesh Cricket Board president Aminul Islam eventually stepped in to present them, while Naqvi handed the runners-up cheque to Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha — who threw it aside.Commentator Simon Doull then announced, “I have been informed by the ACC that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight. So that concludes the post-match presentation.”Naqvi promptly left the stadium — taking the trophy and medals with him.The Indian team stayed on the field for more than 90 minutes, waiting for clarity. Groundsmen twice brought out the 'champions' board before removing it again. Eventually, the players decided to celebrate on their own terms.Hardik Pandya was first to step onto the podium for a selfie, soon joined by the entire squad and support staff. Captain Suryakumar Yadav even recreated Rohit Sharma’s iconic T20 World Cup 2024 victory walk — this time holding an imaginary trophy.“The win is important. If you saw after the match, ‘India’ was written on the big screen. ‘Asia Cup 2025 Champions’ — what’s better than that? You play for that,” Surya told the media.“It was a great moment. Great journey. Great campaign for us as a team. We had a lot of fun,""added Surya.Surya was withering about his team not getting to hoist the trophy. “I have never seen a champion team being denied a trophy, especially one that was so hard-earned,” he said. But he was quick to add, ""My trophies are sitting in the dressing room — all 14 guys with me, the support staff — those are the real trophies of this Asia Cup.”Man of the Tournament Abhishek Sharma lightened the mood with a cheeky remark: “We actually got one. Surya bhai brought it! We felt it, we knew its weight.”Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha, however, defended Naqvi’s position. “If he is the ACC president, then he will only give the trophy. If you don’t want to take it from him, how will you get a trophy?” Agha also accused India of disrespecting cricket.Later in the night BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia issued a sharp statement condemning the incident.“We decided not to accept the Asia Cup 2025 trophy from the ACC chairman, who represents a country currently at odds with ours. That was our stance. But this does not give him the right to take away the trophy and medals. It is extremely unfortunate and unsportsmanlike. We hope the trophy and medals are returned to India as soon as possible. We will lodge a formal protest at the ICC conference in Dubai this Nov,” Saikia told ANI in Mumbai.The drama didn't end there. After PM Modi's post on X congratulating the Indian cricket team for its victory -- which he described as another Operation Sindoor -- went viral, Naqvi posted a sharp response on the microblogging platform.""If war were your measure of pride, history already records your humiliating defeats at Pakistan's hands. No cricket match can rewrite that truth. Dragging war into sport only exposes desperation and disgraces the very spirit of the game,"" Naqvi posted, apparently forgetting the numerous defeats suffered by Pakistan -- including the 1971 war and the Kargil conflict -- and the damage inflicted to it by Operation Sindoor.Surya, incidentally, thanked PM Modi for his support. ""It feels good when the country's leader himself bats on the front foot; it felt like he took the strike and scored runs,"" he told ANI.India–Pakistan matches remain the biggest draw for broadcasters and organisers, a guaranteed revenue generator. With the T20 World Cup looming early next year, all eyes will be on the groupings — and whether the arch-rivals are once again placed in the same pool to guarantee at least one blockbuster clash.In a heartfelt gesture, India’s T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav announced that he would donate his entire match fee from the T20 Asia Cup to the Armed Forces. Surya said the contribution was a personal initiative to honour their sacrifices and service.“It’s a gesture from me. I want to donate the match fees from all the games I’ve played in this Asia Cup to the Armed Forces,” Surya said.",India won the Asia Cup after a thrilling five-wicket victory over Pakistan.

Poll Do you believe that sports should be free from political influence? Yes No

NEW DELHI: India’s T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav addressed the controversy that erupted during the Asia Cup 2025 final after his team refused to shake hands with Pakistani players and declined to accept the trophy from Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Mohsin Naqvi. The incident sparked a debate over whether politics was being brought into cricket during the post-match press conference.The Indian team’s decision to boycott handshakes with Pakistan throughout the tournament had already attracted criticism from Pakistani journalists, who accused the players of violating the spirit of the game.Matters escalated further when the Indian side refused to receive the Asia Cup trophy from Naqvi — Pakistan’s Interior Minister and Asian Cricket Council (ACC) president — known for his reported anti-India remarks.As a result, Naqvi left the venue with the trophy, and the Indian players were left celebrating with an “imaginary” one.During the press conference, a Pakistani journalist confronted Surya with a series of questions regarding the team’s conduct, asking: “Today you are champions, you played a great game. But the question is, throughout this tournament your behavior towards the Pakistan team has been noticed — you didn't do handshakes, you didn't take part in the photo session with the trophy, then you held a political press conference.Do you think that in the history of cricket you are the first captain who has brought politics into the game of cricket?”Despite attempts by the Indian media manager to stop him from responding, Yadav replied: “Do I have to answer or not? Gussa ho rahe ho aap (You're getting angry). I couldn't even understand your question — you asked four questions at the same time.”Following the tournament, Yadav announced that he would donate his match fees to the Indian Army, stating: “I want to give my match fees from all the games which I have played in this tournament to the Indian Army.”The episode highlighted the growing tensions between the two cricketing nations, with the handshake boycott and trophy presentation controversy dominating discussions.

Abhishek Sharma press conference: On support from Gautam Gambhir, intent, winning car, no trophy

Former India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin praised Tilak Varma's match-winning innings of 69 not out in the Asia Cup 2025 final against Pakistan in Dubai on Sunday, where India successfully chased down 147 runs with five wickets remaining and two balls to spare. Varma's composed knock helped India recover from a precarious position of 20/3, while India's spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakaravarthy played crucial roles in restricting Pakistan after their strong start. Ashwin highlighted Varma's ability to handle pressure and his skillful play against both pace and spin bowling during the chase.""Tilak Varma absolutely stole the show. He showed that he made of veins of ice. Outstanding knock. India were in a very precarious situation. Thanks to Haris Rauf, we won the match easily,"" Ashwin said on his YouTube channel.The former spinner elaborated on Varma's technical prowess during the innings, particularly noting his adaptability to the playing conditions.""Tilak Varma soaked the pressure. He played spin really well. He played sweeps, he was able to hit down the ground. He realised that the bounce on the wicket was a little sticky and started playing square off the wicket.People think that it is easy to hit this shot (six to Rauf) but falling in the line and picking it up is difficult,"" he added.The match saw significant contributions from India's spin bowling duo of Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakaravarthy, who helped contain Pakistan's innings after a strong start.""I would like to give credit to Varun Chakaravarthy and Kuldeep Yadav. It was a next level comeback. Sahibzada Farhan and Fakhar Zaman gave them a superb start. However, this is difference between Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka handed our spinners beautifully and even made the right shot selection. If you look at teams in Asia, Pakistan have very good players of spin. However, it is big match pressure. There are many people in the Indian team who can face this pressure,"" Ashwin said.Kuldeep Yadav emerged as the tournament's leading wicket-taker with 17 wickets in seven matches at an average of 9.29.Ashwin provided insights into why Kuldeep Yadav was particularly effective in the tournament, citing the unique characteristics of Dubai's pitches.""The reason Kuldeep Yadav bowled so well was because, the shot that Sanju got out, the same shot in IPL in Jaipur would have been a six over extra cover. In Dubai, when you bowl slow, the ball sits down and becomes lumpy with more bounce. It takes a top edge. See the example of Saim Ayub, he tried to cut it but it took an edge and Bumrah caught it at point. Wickets like this would never fall in the IPL. Think carefully. That is probably the difference,"" he explained.The victory marked a significant achievement for the Indian team under Suryakumar Yadav 's leadership, with both batting and bowling departments contributing to the successful campaign.The tournament showcased India's depth in both batting and spin bowling departments, with young players like Tilak Varma stepping up in crucial situations and experienced bowlers like Kuldeep Yadav maintaining consistent performances throughout the competition.",Ravichandran Ashwin praises Tilak Varma's match-winning innings of 69 not out in the Asia Cup 2025 final against Pakistan in Dubai on Sunday.

Former Indian cricket captain Kapil Dev called for keeping politics separate from cricket following India's refusal to accept the Asia Cup trophy and medals from Pakistan 's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi after their five-wicket victory over Pakistan in the final at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on September 28, 2025.The presentation ceremony was delayed and shortened after the Indian team declined to receive the awards from Naqvi, who heads both the Pakistan Cricket Board and the Asian Cricket Council. The Indian team instead celebrated their victory on the field without the official awards.The match itself saw Pakistan make a strong start with an 84-run opening partnership between Fakhar Zaman and Sahibzada Farhan. However, they suffered a dramatic collapse, losing nine wickets for just 33 runs to finish at 146 in 19.1 overs. India successfully chased down the target despite losing three early wickets.""I just want to say — your responsibility, and responsibility for the entire media also we should look into the sports side rather than looking into the politics side. Yes, media has the responsibility to bring everything on the table, but as a sportsman, I would like to see that we should stick to sports. It will be much better,"" Kapil Dev said in an interview with India Today.The controversy extended beyond the trophy presentation. Pakistan's Haris Rauf received a fine of 30 percent of his match fee for making a provocative 'plane crash' gesture during the Super Four match. Additionally, Sahibzada Farhan received a warning for his 'gunshot' celebration after scoring fifty runs, which he defended as a cultural expression.Kapil Dev, who led India to their first World Cup victory in 1983, also commented on the current state of Pakistani cricket talent compared to previous generations.""Yeah, I think they don't have the similar talent they used to have in the '80s, '90s or before that. Pakistan has given us, to the world, one of the best cricketers. You can talk about Imran Khan, you can talk about Javed Miandad, Zaheer Abbas, Wasim Akram , Waqar Younis. They have given us that talent. But unfortunately, we can't see similar talent today — not even one percent of what they used to have,"" Kapil Dev added.The Asia Cup final victory marked a significant achievement for India, despite the controversy surrounding the presentation ceremony. The team's performance demonstrated their ability to handle pressure situations, successfully chasing down the target with two balls remaining in their innings.The incident has highlighted the ongoing challenges in keeping sports separate from political tensions between the two nations. Despite these challenges, the focus remains on the cricket played on the field and the sporting achievements of both teams.The match will be remembered not only for India's victory but also for the broader context of cricket diplomacy and its role in India-Pakistan relations.

Heated press conferences: How India and Pakistan went at each other in Asia Cup 2025

Live Score:

NEW DELHI: Another storm brewed at the Asia Cup 2025 final between India and Pakistan on Sunday at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, as Pakistan pacers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf found themselves at the centre of a fresh controversy.Moments before the blockbuster clash got underway, both teams lined up for the national anthem s. Pakistan’s anthem played first, followed by India’s. While players from both sides stood in attention as per protocol, cameras captured Shaheen and Haris casually chatting during India’s national anthem — a gesture that quickly went viral and was widely slammed as “disrespectful.”The incident has only fuelled tensions in what was already a high-voltage summit clash. It came on the heels of another flashpoint: India skipper Suryakumar Yadav sticking to the “No Handshake” policy against Pakistan.At the toss, Suryakumar shook hands with broadcaster Ravi Shastri but pointedly ignored former Pakistan captain Waqar Younis. Just like in the group stage and Super Four encounters earlier in the tournament, he also skipped the customary handshake with Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha.Adding further intrigue, the toss itself was conducted in an unusual manner, with Shastri interviewing the Indian captain and Waqar handling Pakistan’s leader — a rare arrangement in world cricket.To make things worse, the Pakistan skipper also claimed that Suryakumar had shaken hands with him not once, but twice in private before the handshake snubs started on-camera.For India, the evening also began with a massive setback as skipper Suryakumar confirmed at the toss that star all-rounder Hardik Pandya was ruled out due to a niggle. The absence of Pandya, who has a proven record in big matches against Pakistan, leaves a significant void in India’s line-up.With controversies over handshakes, anthem etiquette, and team selection overshadowing the pre-match proceedings, the stage was set for an emotionally charged finale.In the end, it was India that came out on top after a tense affair in Dubai. After Pakistan were skittled out for a 146-run total, India too, had to overcome early challenges. After being reduced to 20/3 inside the powerplay, the Suryakumar-led side rode on the back of a sensational batting display from Tilak Varma (69* from 53 balls) and a solid partnership with Shivam Dube (33 from 22 balls) to clinch the trophy. In the end, it was Rinku Singh, who faced his first-ever ball of this tournament, who scored the winning runs with a four in the fourth delivery of the final over.",Pakistan pacers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf found themselves at the centre of a fresh controversy during the national anthem.

The fierce energy of our boys blew up the rivals again.""External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar wrote, ""Congrats to Team India on winning the Asia Cup. New India delivers.""Reacting to the victory, ICC chairman Jay Shah also congratulated India, penning, ""Congratulations to Team India on lifting the Asia Cup 2025! A proud moment for Indian cricket as Team India showcases excellence, consistency, and character on the biggest stage.Kudos to the players and support staff for a stellar campaign.""On Sunday, Tilak Varma’s unbeaten 69 was the cornerstone of India’s five-wicket win in Dubai, securing a record-extending ninth Asia Cup crown.Chasing 147, India endured early jolts at 20/3 and later 77/4, but the 21-year-old left-hander displayed poise well beyond his years.With three fours and four sixes, he anchored the innings, forging a crucial 60-run partnership with Shivam Dube (33).The final over held its share of drama.India needed 10 runs from six balls after Dube’s dismissal, but Varma swung momentum back with a towering six before Rinku Singh finished the job with a boundary, sparking joyous celebrations in a stadium dominated by Indian supporters.Earlier, Kuldeep Yadav’s spin heroics (4/30) turned the contest in India’s favour.Pakistan had raced to 84 without loss, thanks to Sahibzada Farhan’s 57 and Fakhar Zaman’s 46.Yet their promising platform crumbled as they lost nine wickets for just 33 runs, eventually bowled out for 146 in 19.1 overs. Kuldeep’s 17th-over burst, three wickets in four balls, including skipper Salman Agha, was the decisive strike.The rivalry’s political undertones loomed large. There were no handshakes at the toss or after the match, echoing tensions between the neighbours. Jasprit Bumrah even mirrored Haris Rauf’s earlier gesture to the crowd after bowling him out, adding another fiery subplot to the clash.India’s third win over Pakistan in this tournament not only reaffirmed their dominance but also served as a dress rehearsal ahead of next year’s T20 World Cup.For fans, though, the moment was captured in Modi’s words and Varma’s calm finish — #OperationSindoor had played out on the cricket field, and India had triumphed again.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded India's thrilling Asia Cup 2025 triumph over Pakistan with a striking message on X.

Poll Do you believe India's spin attack was the key to their victory against Pakistan? Yes, definitely! No, it was the batting

India’s spin attack tore apart Pakistan in the Asia Cup 2025 final on Sunday, setting up a five-wicket win and a ninth title in the competition. While Kuldeep Yadav led the way with four wickets, fellow spinner Varun Chakravarthy also played a decisive role with figures of 2/30, including the prized wickets of openers Sahibzada Farhan and Fakhar Zaman.Chakravarthy’s impact came during Pakistan’s sudden collapse, where the batting order fell apart after a strong 84-run opening stand. From 113/1, Pakistan were bowled out for 146 in 19.1 overs, losing their last nine wickets for just 33 runs. Alongside Varun and Kuldeep, Axar Patel (2/26) and Jasprit Bumrah (2/25) also chipped in to put India in command.Chasing 147, India overcame early trouble at 20/3 thanks to Tilak Varma’s calm and unbeaten 69 off 53 balls.

It was India’s third victory over Pakistan in the tournament, having already beaten them in the league stage and Super Four.The post-match happenings, however, extended beyond the sport itself. With the Indian team refusing to accept the trophy from Asian Cricket Council (ACC) president and PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi, the celebrations carried on without the official silverware.Players humorously posed with imaginary trophies, even editing trophies into their pictures.Varun Chakravarthy took the creativity a step further. On Instagram, the 34-year-old shared a series of images that had fans in splits. Two of them showed him lying in bed with a mug in his arms, mimicking the way athletes often pose with trophies after major victories. In another post, he shared a close-up of the mug itself, symbolically presenting it as India’s Asia Cup prize.He captioned the post, ""akkha duniya ek taraf, aur mera INDIA ek taraf. JAI HIND !!!""The lighthearted gesture quickly went viral, with fans praising Chakravarthy’s sense of humor and adding to the posts that 'mocked' the trophy controversy. His post became one of the standout reactions in a series of social media celebrations by Indian players after the historic win.Even without the actual trophy, India’s cricketers ensured the moment was unforgettable, and Chakravarthy’s mug post summed up the team’s decision to celebrate on their own terms.","India beat Pakistan by five wickets in the Asia Cup 2025 final on Sunday.

India captain Suryakumar Yadav made a heartfelt gesture after leading his side to the Asia Cup 2025 title, announcing that he would donate his entire match fees from the tournament to the Indian armed forces The skipper also did not mince words in expressing his disappointment with the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) for denying the champions their trophy despite a hard-fought campaign.“I think this is one thing I have never seen. Since I started playing and following cricket, a champion team being denied a trophy. That too a hard-earned one,” Suryakumar said after India’s five-wicket win over Pakistan in the final at the Dubai International Stadium.India remained unbeaten throughout the tournament, defeating Pakistan thrice, including in the final. But the absence of the trophy presentation left a sour note amid the celebrations.“For me, the real trophies are sitting in the dressing room — my 14 teammates and the support staff. They are the reason we won this title. Still, a team winning a hard-fought tournament and not getting a trophy is something I have never seen,” he added.On the off-field developments, the Indian captain said it did not affect his captaincy.""I feel it was not that difficult. The boys took it in their stride. They were really happy with the way the campaign was going.""Since day one I have been telling them only one thing: Let's just focus on cricket on the ground. And when we go to the practice sessions, let's enjoy what we are doing. Do the same things that we want to do in the game.""I think the boys took it in a positive way. I feel unbeaten in the tournament, the boys stepped up whenever needed. I think those are the small moments, small trophies, which we won going forward into the World Cup year.""And as I said earlier also, I have never seen this — a team winning a hard-earned tournament and not getting a trophy. We can't say we were disappointed. But if you see, we had a lot of smiles on our faces as we were on the ground enjoying the moment on the podium,"" he said.The India skipper also opened up about his own batting form, brushing aside talk of being “out of form.”“I don’t think I am out of form; I am out of runs. I believe in my preparations. In matches, things go on autopilot. God is watching, and if you keep doing well, everything comes on time,” he said.Capping off his press conference with a surprise announcement, Suryakumar revealed: “As a gesture, I want to donate my match fees from all the games in this tournament to the Indian Army .

Team India celebrates the Asia Cup win on the podium without the trophy.

The Asia Cup 2025 final between arch-rivals India and Pakistan ended in ugly drama on Sunday night at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium in Dubai, after Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman and ACC president Mohsin Naqvi walked away with the winners’ trophy, leaving the presentation ceremony in complete disarray.Champions India, who defeated Pakistan by five wickets to clinch a record-extending ninth Asia Cup title, refused to accept the silverware from Naqvi. The players stood firm at a distance from the stage, reportedly informing the organisers that they would not participate in the presentation if the PCB chief attempted to hand over the trophy.The standoff brought the ceremony to a grinding halt. As Naqvi waited awkwardly on the dais, Indian fans inside the stadium booed loudly, while chanting “Bharat Mata Ki Jai”, making the atmosphere even more hostile. It was quite apparent that Naqvi didn’t want to see India getting photographed with the trophy, with organisers eventually whisking the trophy away into the dressing room after prolonged delays.Sources revealed that the Indian team had already informed the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) that Naqvi, who is also Pakistan’s interior minister, was an unacceptable figure to present the trophy. The refusal followed a series of frosty exchanges during the tournament — from no handshakes between players, to the absence of the traditional pre-toss photoshoot.An ACC source further revealed that the Indian team made it clear they didn’t want Naqvi on the podium.In another twist, the Pakistan players remained inside their dressing room for nearly an hour after the match, leaving Naqvi stranded on stage. When skipper Salman Agha and his team eventually emerged, they were greeted by deafening chants of “Indiaaaa, Indiaaaa” from the crowd.On the field, however, India’s win was emphatic. Tilak Varma anchored the chase with an unbeaten 69 off 53 balls, adding a crucial 60-run stand with Shivam Dube (33). Earlier, Kuldeep Yadav’s 4-30 dismantled Pakistan’s middle order, restricting them to 146 after a promising start from Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46).While India celebrated yet another continental crown, the night will be remembered as much for the cricket as for the chaotic and unprecedented trophy fiasco that followed.","India defeated Pakistan by five wickets to clinch a record-extending ninth Asia Cup title.

Poll Do you think the trophy controversy overshadowed India's victory? Yes, it detracted from the win. No, the win is what matters most.

India’s Asia Cup triumph over Pakistan on Sunday night in Dubai was overshadowed by unprecedented drama after the final whistle. The presentation ceremony turned chaotic when Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman and Asian Cricket Council (ACC) president Mohsin Naqvi allegedly walked away with the winners’ trophy, leaving the stage empty and fans stunned.India, who had just beaten Pakistan by five wickets, refused to accept the silverware from Naqvi. Players reportedly informed organisers beforehand that they would not step on stage if the PCB chief attempted to hand over the trophy.Speaking after the incident, BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia congratulated the team but made his protest clear over the post-match controversy. “My first reaction is that BCCI is extremely happy and we congratulate Indian cricket team for defeating Pakistan, hands down, at the group stage, at the Super 4, as well as in the final. All three matches were one sided and we congratulate our players as well as the support staff for bringing a lot of glory to our country. We are very proud of our team and they have excellently delivered on the cricket pitch,” Saikia said.He used the opportunity to link the victory to a larger sense of national pride, saying, “Our armed forces have delivered in the border area. Now the same thing has been repeated in Dubai.So this is an excellent moment, a momentous occasion for Indian cricket.”On the cash reward, Saikia confirmed what awaits the players following the win in the final. “We are very happy and they have done an extremely good job on the ground, defeating Pakistan 3-0. And there was absolutely no resistance. All the matches were one sided. So we have decided that there will be a cash reward to the Indian team, which will be 21 crores. It will be distributed among the players and all the support staff. ”But his strongest words were reserved for the trophy controversy. “In fact, we have decided not to take the trophy from the ACC chairman, who happens to be one of the leaders of Pakistan. But that does not mean that the gentleman will take away the trophy with him along with the medals. So it is very unfortunate, very unsporting and we hope that the trophy and the medals will be returned to India as soon as possible.”Saikia confirmed that a formal complaint will follow. “This is definitely we are going to do. There is an ICC conference in the first week of November in Dubai. In the next conference, we are going to launch a very serious and very strong protest against the act of ACC chairperson,” he stated.Even as off-field controversy stole the spotlight, the final itself had moments of brilliance. Kuldeep Yadav’s 4/30 broke Pakistan’s middle order after Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46) gave them a promising start. Bowled out for 146, Pakistan left India with a modest chase, which Tilak Varma (69 not out) and Shivam Dube (33) finished with a composed 60-run stand.Saikia stressed that the victory was in line with India’s sporting policy, adding, “Actually, BCCI from the very first day, we have followed the spirit and the policy formulated by the Government of India regarding all games, cricketers were no exception. When it is a bilateral tournament, India is not going to play against Pakistan or any other hostile country. And BCCI has been doing it for the last 12 to 15 years… But today, with this handsome win over Pakistan and the thumping victory of 3-0, I am sure we will bring a lot of happiness to our people. The country is really proud of the performance of Indian cricket team.”He summed up with a simple note, exclaiming, “Yes, absolutely. I follow your statement that everything is well that ends well.”",India beat Pakistan by five wickets in the Asia Cup final in Dubai.

India vs Pakistan breaks out between journalists in Dubai during Salman Agha press conference

Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal has called on the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to boycott matches against India in upcoming multi-nation events following a controversy at the Asia Cup 2025 trophy presentation. The incident occurred when India's team refused to accept the trophy from Mohsin Naqvi, who serves as both the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) head and PCB chairman, leading to a 45-minute delay in the ceremony after India's five-wicket victory in the final.The trophy presentation controversy emerged after India's team maintained their position of not wanting to receive the trophy from Naqvi, who also holds the position of Interior Minister of Pakistan. Throughout the tournament, Naqvi had expressed anti-India sentiments on social media despite his role as ACC head.Naqvi had previously requested the removal of match referee Andy Pycroft following a no-handshake incident during the India-Pakistan group stage match. The situation has sparked significant reactions within Pakistan's cricket community.""Pakistan board should immediately say that 'we should never play against India'.Let's see what action ICC takes. What else evidence do you need after this? But the BCCI person is leading the ICC – how will he (Jay Shah) take any action? The other boards have to come together, say we can't see this in cricket. Sport is not played at anyone's home. If others don't play them, then no money is going to come,"" Akmal stated in his interview with ARY News.Akmal further suggested the formation of a neutral committee to address the tournament's events: ""The earlier these things can be controlled, the better for everybody. A neutral body has to be formed without Pakistan and India, make a committee of Australians, South Africans, and New Zealanders and let them decide on what action to be taken about all that has happened in this tournament.""The tournament was marked by several controversial incidents, including India's refusal to shake hands with Pakistan players after the Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives. The Super 4s match also saw heightened tensions with Pakistani pacers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf sledging Indian openers, while Sahibzada Farhan performed a gun celebration after scoring his half-century.""This cheap harkatein (behaviour) we shall keep seeing from India. We have seen in this tournament that they have done as much damage to cricket as they could. PCB and ACC president took the right stand – take the trophy or not, it will be given by the president only. India will become the joke of the cricketing world,"" Akmal expressed.The controversy has highlighted the ongoing tensions between the two cricket boards and raised questions about the future of India-Pakistan cricket relations in international tournaments. The incident has garnered attention from the cricket community worldwide and may impact future cricket diplomatic relations between the two nations.The situation represents another chapter in the complex relationship between Indian and Pakistani cricket, with both sides maintaining their respective positions regarding the trophy presentation incident. The matter has now become a topic of discussion among cricket administrators and former players from both countries.","Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal has called on the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to boycott matches against India.

For decades, the landscape of women’s international cricket was a story of haves and have-nots. The Indian women’s team, brimming with innate talent, often found themselves on the wrong side of that divide, not for a lack of skill, but for a lack of system. As former India batsman and ex-women’s team coach WV Raman reflects, “The Indian women’s team has really progressed a lot in recent years, especially after coming under the wing of the BCCI . Now they get to play more matches and obviously there are more opportunities. And that has shown in the way they performed.”He pinpoints the historical gap not to a deficit in ability, but to a chasm in preparation. “Earlier, they were probably not as good in terms of fitness and stuff like the New Zealand or England or the other teams in the past. This is not to say that they were lacking talent-wise. But the problem was lack of experience by way of playing more cricket and maybe lack of facilities to train, or even the knowledge on how to train correctly. ”This context is crucial to understanding the rise of their ultimate benchmark and toughest opponent: Australia. The Australian women’s team has long been the undisputed powerhouse, a dynasty built on a foundation laid years before others even began to build.Raman compares their dominance to an iconic era in men’s cricket, stating, “They have had a head start over others...There was something like the West Indies team under Clive Lloyd in the 70s. In the sense that they had the talent, they had a pool of players and they also had the backing of the cricket board and everything was structured well.”This structural advantage was compounded by a cultural one. “Also, culturally what happens is, in Australia, generally the girls get to go to school and play different sports at a young age which makes them agile and strong. Australia has always had a big advantage over the others in terms of starting things sooner than the rest.”.For India, catching up meant overhauling an entire ecosystem. The challenge was, and remains, monumental. Raman outlines the scale, explaining, “Australia has six states. But India is a huge country and it has got in excess of 30-odd associations.”Beyond logistics, there were deep-seated social hurdles. “What used to happen earlier was, culturally it was deemed as rebellious for a woman to say she will play cricket. Now, culturally, we are seeing things differently. There is more awareness. The infrastructure is gradually becoming better.”He highlights the unique challenges of developing the women’s game, noting, “It is difficult to set up things for girls because they need easy access to infrastructure to travel and practise. You can't send a 14-15-year-old girl on a one and a half hour bus ride like you would for a boy.”Despite this, he is quick to credit the governing body, “Given these challenges, BCCI has done a tremendous job of ensuring that the girls get to play more cricket. Domestic structure is improving all the time.”The real game-changers, however, have been strategic investments in the pipeline. Raman reveals, “When I was the coach of the Indian side, we also started the ‘A’ concept for the girls which is still continuing.”This focus on building depth is now being supercharged by two revolutionary developments. “Two interesting moves have also taken place. One is the Under-19 World Cup, which obviously will push the administrators to create infrastructure and provide more match opportunities for girls below 19. And the other thing which obviously would encourage the parents to put their girls into cricket is the start of Women’s Premier League (WPL). ”The result of this multi-pronged revolution is a dramatic shift in the world order. The team that once struggled for parity is now the one that strikes fear into the heart of the champion. The proof, as they say, is in the pressure.Raman concludes with a powerful testament to India’s newfound status: “Thanks to the strides they have made recently, Australia is always wary of India. And India has been challenging Australia like no other side has done in the recent past. Australia is aware that if any team can beat them, it is India.”The journey from rebellious aspiration to credible threat is nearly complete. The final frontier is now well within sight.","Former India batsman and ex-women’s team coach WV Raman reflects on the rise of the Indian women's team. He points out the historical gap not to a deficit in ability, but to a chasm in preparation. For India, catching up meant overhauling an entire ecosystem.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124217920,imgsize-70276,width-400,resizemode-4/captains-wc-2909-sd.jpg"

MUMBAI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is set to raise a formal protest against Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chairman Mohsin Naqvi after he reportedly took the Asia Cup trophy and winners' medals with him following India’s refusal to accept it from him at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium in Dubai on Sunday.Speaking to TOI, BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia said, “We had decided not to take the trophy from the ACC chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who happens to be Pakistan’s Interior Minister. However, that does not mean that the gentleman will take away the trophy.”He confirmed that India’s representatives, BCCI vice-president Rajiv Shukla and Ashish Shelar, would raise the issue in the ACC meeting in Dubai on Tuesday.“Our two representatives are going to raise a serious objection against the chairperson of the ACC for illegally retaining the trophy. He has no right to keep it,” Saikia added.If the ACC doesn’t pay heed to the BCCI’s deep concern on the issue, the BCCI will take its complaint to the ICC.He further stated, “I hope that good sense will prevail upon Naqvi and he will give the trophy and the medals to us. In the next ICC conference in Dubai in the first week of November, we are going to lodge a very serious and very strong protest against the act of ACC chairperson.”Saikia also condemned the delay in the presentation ceremony, saying, “We came along with the medals, so it is very unfortunate, very unsporting and we hope that the trophy and the medals will be returned to India as soon as possible.”None of the BCCI officials travelled to Dubai to watch the final of the Asia Cup, even as all the Board office-bearers and former India women’s team captains are set to be present in Guwahati for the opening ceremony of the Women’s World Cup.On Sunday night, after India beat Pakistan in a pulsating final by five wickets, Suryakumar Yadav & Co were left to celebrate on the champions’ podium without a trophy.The standoff between the BCCI and Naqvi first resulted in the presentation ceremony being delayed by almost 90 minutes and ended with the presenter walking away with the trophy instead of the winning captain.Meanwhile, while announcing a cash prize of Rs 21 crore combined to India’s squad, including players and support staff, immediately after India clinched the Asia Cup for a record-extending ninth time, Saikia drew a parallel between the Asia Cup triumph and Operation Sindoor in May, in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attacks.“We are very proud of our team. They have delivered brilliantly on the cricket pitch, just like our armed forces delivered and protected our country at the border in May. Now the same thing has been repeated in Dubai. This is a momentous occasion for Indian cricket,” Saikia said.","The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is set to raise a formal protest against Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chairman Mohsin Naqvi.

Who is Mohsin Naqvi ?



NEW DELHI: The Indian cricket team refused to accept the Asia Cup trophy from Pakistan’s Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, who also serves as the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chairman, following their five-wicket victory over Pakistan in the final at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.According to reports, the BCCI had informed the ACC in advance that the team would not receive the trophy from Naqvi due to his strong anti-India stance.The incident unfolded nearly 90 minutes after India’s triumph, with players celebrating on the field alongside their families — including captain Suryakumar Yadav’s wife and head coach Gautam Gambhir’s family.Naqvi, along with officials from the ACC and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), waited on stage to present the trophy, but the Indian team continued its tournament-long policy of avoiding handshakes with Pakistan.Born in Lahore on October 28, 1978, Naqvi studied at Crescent Model Higher Secondary School and Government College University, before pursuing journalism at Ohio University in the United States.He began his career with an internship at CNN before founding the City Media Group in Pakistan.Naqvi was appointed to the PCB governing board by caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar ul Haq Kakar on January 22, 2024, and was later elected unopposed as the 37th PCB chairman on February 6, 2024.His elevation drew criticism, as he had previously served as caretaker Chief Minister of Punjab and lacked a professional cricketing background.Married to Warda Ashraf, daughter of the late SSP Ashraf Marth and niece of former Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Pervez Elahi, Naqvi is connected to one of Pakistan’s most influential political families.The couple has four children — three daughters and one son.",Mohsin Naqvi is Pakistan's Interior Minister and chairman of the Asian Cricket Council.

When India searches for a hero, they find Smriti Mandhana . Donning the same iconic No. 18 as Virat Kohli , she carries not just the legacy of a golden era on her shoulders, but the hopes of a nation starving for a World Cup crown.As vice-captain and the world’s top-ranked ODI batter, her role is as pivotal as any in modern cricket. And with the 2025 Women’s World Cup beginning tomorrow, India's quest for a maiden ICC title rests almost entirely on her elegant, yet explosive, blade.The southpaw's brilliance shone in the recent three-match ODI series against Australia, with scores of 58 off 63 and a match-winning 117 off 91, powering India to a historic 102-run victory in New Chandigarh — their first home ODI win over Australia since 2007. In the Delhi finale, she unleashed a record-breaking 125 off 63 balls — India’s fastest ODI century, second only to Meg Lanning’s 45-ball global mark — showcasing her signature cover drives and a blistering 198.41 strike rate.These knocks signal Smriti’s peak form as an opener.Her 2025 stats are phenomenal: 928 runs in 14 ODI innings at a 66.28 average, with four centuries and three fifties. Beyond the Australia heroics, she smashed a 80-ball 135 against Ireland and a 116 in the Tri-Series final versus Sri Lanka.Her fifty-to-century conversion rate reflects ruthless consistency.The 29-year-old opener is the fastest Indian woman to 4,000 ODI runs and has even surpassed Kohli’s record for India’s quickest ODI ton in 52 balls, taking only 50 deliveries to reach the milestone.The way 2025 has unfolded for the star India batter, along with home conditions that favour her aggressive game, the record books are on high alert this World Cup. She is poised to top Mithali Raj’s Indian single-edition record (178 runs, 2017) and chase Lanning’s 15 centuries — one more ties it, two rewrites history.Smriti’s evolution is a journey of grit and genius. From a 16-year-old debutant in 2013, all grace and glasses, she’s become a 360-degree force. A 2017 ACL tear tested her, but by 2018, she was ICC Cricketer of the Year. Her 2021 Test ton (127) during India’s tour of Australia and 2024 WPL title as RCB captain highlight her versatility. In 2025, her 115.85 strike rate and all-format centuries (first Indian woman) mark her class.Is she India’s greatest? The stats roar yes.As India start their World Cup campaign with the opener against Sri Lanka in Guwahati, Smriti’s sublime touch makes her the trailblazer to lead the charge.","Smriti Mandhana is the world’s top-ranked ODI batter. The 29-year-old opener is the fastest Indian woman to 4,000 ODI runs. Her 2025 stats are phenomenal: 928 runs in 14 ODI innings at a 66.28 average.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124215590,imgsize-46702,width-400,resizemode-4/mandhana-2909-sds.jpg"

Yamal's return

Lamine Yamal returned from injury to help Barcelona beat Real Sociedad 2-1 on Sunday and move top of La Liga by one point.After Real Madrid were thrashed 5-2 by rivals Atletico Madrid in a derby on Saturday, Hansi Flick's side had the chance to claim pole position above Xabi Alonso's side.Alvaro Odriozola gave Real Sociedad the lead against the run of play in the first half but Jules Kounde headed the Spanish champions level.Yamal, who missed the last four games with a groin injury, created the winner for Robert Lewandowski just moments after coming on as a second-half substitute.""I'm very happy for (Yamal), very pleased that he's back on the pitch because we're going to need him,"" Kounde told Movistar.""He showed directly the outstanding strength he has to create chances, to give that last pass,"" said Flick.Barcelona held the game at the Olympic stadium, where they have played for the last two seasons, after the city council refused them a permit to reopen their Camp Nou home earlier in the week.Flick handed 17-year-old attacking midfielder Dro Fernandez his debut, also starting Roony Bardghji on the right wing and bringing in veteran Wojciech Szczesny for injured goalkeeper Joan Garcia.Barcelona dominated the ball in the first half but found it hard to beat Real Sociedad goalkeeper Alex Remiro.The Spain international made a fine save to deny Marcus Rashford in the early stages.On loan from Manchester United, Rashford is finding his footing at Barca and played a superb through ball for Lewandowski, who fired across the face of goal from a tight angle.Real Sociedad hit Barca with a sharp counter-attack to open the scoring after 31 minutes.Former Real Madrid defender Odriozola applied the finishing touch to Ander Barrenetxea's cross.Barcelona stepped up a gear and found the equaliser from a corner before the break.Rashford, who provided an assist from another corner against Real Oviedo in midweek, whipped it to the near post, where Kounde powered home a header.Flick replaced Dro with Dani Olmo at half-time and also brought on Yamal before the hour mark, after the teenager recovered from his groin issue.Voted the second best player in the world at the Ballon d'Or gala on Monday, Yamal made an instant impact.The 18-year-old burst into the box and crossed for Lewandowski to head home off the post, just over a minute after his introduction.""His presence on the pitch is a threat,"" said Real Sociedad coach Sergio Francisco.""Even putting on fresh players against him (doesn't work)... he's showing he's the best player in the world.""Szczesny made a good save from Oyarzabal as La Real gave Barcelona a couple of scares, while Remiro denied Rashford and Olmo with two more good saves.The game grew increasingly chaotic and both sides hit the crossbar in quick succession.Kounde, daydreaming in midfield, was robbed and Real Sociedad worked the ball to Takefusa Kubo, who crashed a shot against the woodwork.Then Barcelona broke away and Ferran Torres teed up Lewandowski, who battered the crossbar when well placed to put the game to bed, but the hosts were not punished.""It was a difficult game, I didn't like our last 25 minutes, we suffered too much,"" added Kounde.""The first 70 minutes I think were quite good, we could have scored more than two... but I didn't like how it ended.""Barcelona host Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Wednesday, also at the Olympic stadium.Real Sociedad have had a tough start to the season, sitting 17th, but have been improving and will take heart from the pressure they put Barca under.""Despite the defeat I'm proud of the team's work,"" said Odriozola. ""It's been a tough start and today we showed up.""Earlier Sunday, promoted side Elche beat Celta Vigo 2-1 to climb up to fourth.Valencia's match on Monday at home against Real Oviedo is at risk of postponement because of expected heavy rain in the region. Last year flooding in the area killed over 200 people.",Lamine Yamal returns from injury to help Barcelona beat Real Sociedad 2-1. Yamal created the winner for Robert Lewandowski just moments after coming on as a second-half substitute. Alvaro Odriozola gave Real the lead against the run of play in the first half.

We wanted to go up in the standings but we have to move forward.We have more four games, so we will try to win all the games and try to finish as high as possible,"" Mascherano added.Miami, who have already secured a playoff spot, now sit in third place in the Eastern Conference.They have accumulated 56 points and trail conference leaders Philadelphia by four points, though Miami holds a game in hand.The match showcased Miami's continued offensive prowess but also highlighted their defensive vulnerabilities, which have been apparent throughout the season.Johnson's performance in goal for Toronto proved decisive in preventing Miami from collecting all three points.","Inter Miami and Toronto FC played to a 1-1 draw in Major League Soccer on Saturday.

""If I think it's not safe, we're going to move it out of that city...,"" he said, before discussing crime statistics in Chicago, which is not a World Cup host city.San Francisco and Seattle are each scheduled to host six matches, while Los Angeles will host eight games during the tournament.""So no, if any city we think is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup, or for the Olympics ... but for the World Cup in particular, because they're playing in so many cities, we won't allow it to go, we'll move it around a little bit,"" Trump added, making reference to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.Trump's administration has previously deployed national guard troops to Democratic-governed cities this year, despite opposition from local and state leaders.Earlier this year, Trump appointed himself chairman of a White House task force for the World Cup, which is overseen by FIFA.Trump, who maintains a close relationship with FIFA President Gianni Infantino, has promised visiting fans can expect a ""seamless"" experience.Infantino has expressed ""full and entire"" confidence in the Trump administration's ability to help deliver a successful tournament.","US President Donald Trump says he would consider relocating 2026 FIFA World Cup matches from US host cities he deems as security risks.

Aston Villa secured their first win of the season with a 1-0 victory over Bologna in their Europa League opener, while Rangers suffered a 1-0 home defeat to Genk on Thursday, intensifying pressure on their manager Russell Martin. The matches marked the beginning of the Europa League campaign for both teams.Villa, despite being pre-tournament favorites and reaching the Champions League quarter-finals last season, had struggled with their form, failing to win any of their first five Premier League games. The victory came amid internal tensions, with manager Unai Emery recently criticizing his players and sporting director Monchi departing the club.John McGinn's strike in the 13th minute proved decisive for Villa. The Scotland international found the bottom corner with a shot from the edge of the area.Ollie Watkins, who started on the bench due to his goalless run this season, missed a penalty in the second half with Łukasz Skorupski making an easy save.Bologna came close to equalizing when Santiago Castro's header hit the crossbar, but Villa managed to hold on for the win, repeating their success against the Italian side from their previous Champions League encounter.""Important to get a win at home after not our strongest start to the season,"" McGinn said. ""We haven't been good enough. We've had a lot of praise the past couple of seasons and we're rightly being criticised at the minute.""Rangers' situation worsened as they played with ten men after Mohamed Diomande's red card before halftime for a dangerous challenge.Former Celtic striker Oh Hyeon-Gyu missed a penalty for Genk in first-half stoppage time but redeemed himself by scoring the winning goal ten minutes into the second half.Martin, who joined Rangers in June, has now gone eight games without a win in both Scottish Premiership and European competitions.In other Europa League matches, Lille secured a 2-1 victory over Norwegian side Brann with Olivier Giroud scoring the winner.American player Tanner Tessmann helped Lyon defeat Utrecht 1-0.Stuttgart emerged victorious with a 2-1 win over Celta Vigo.Porto claimed a 1-0 away victory against RB Salzburg.","Aston Villa secured their first win of the season with a 1-0 victory over Bologna.

Oviedo goalkeeper Aaron Escandell made multiple saves from his attempts.""I saw the goalkeeper's mistake and I went first time, and in the moment I kicked it, I saw it was good,"" Oviedo midfielder Reina told DAZN. ""My first in the top flight, I'll never forget it.""Flick defended his goalkeeper's mistake: ""It's the style that we want him to play in, and it can happen. He's a fantastic goalkeeper... one mistake and they use it, but it's football.""De Jong's introduction at halftime helped Barcelona increase their tempo. Escandell continued making saves from Raphinha and Torres before Lewandowski's breakthrough.""The changes were at the right time, with Frenkie and also with Lewy,"" said Flick.Lewandowski, who has mainly been used as a substitute this season following an early injury, showed patience: ""I'm patient, I'm not in a hurry, the season is long and we have a lot of games.""Despite the loss, Oviedo's goalscorer remained positive: ""All footballers dream of nights like this, to play against these players and with these fans.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything.

Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

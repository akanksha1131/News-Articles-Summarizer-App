Throwback to when Patrick Mahomes got candid about being a proud girl dad for the first time: “I Wanted to Have a Boy First”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/throwback-to-when-patrick-mahomes-got-candid-about-being-a-proud-girl-dad-for-the-first-time-i-wanted-to-have-a-boy-first/articleshow/121870109.cms,"Patrick Mahomes reveals what being a girl dad means to him (Getty Images)

Patrick Mahomes’ heartfelt moment as a girl dad resurfaces and it’s melting fans all over again







Kansas City Chiefs superstar Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany Mahomes, recently melted hearts on social media by revealing the face of their youngest child, Golden, for the first time. The post, shared jointly by the couple on Instagram, marks the first public glimpse of baby Golden’s face since her birth five months ago, on January 12, 2025.The post featured a tender family moment, highlighting all three of their children — Sterling (4), Bronze (2), and the newest member of the Mahomes clan, baby Golden. Patrick, holding Golden gently in his arms, beams with pride as she sucks on her tiny hand, dressed in a white onesie and sporting an oversized white bow that made her look even more adorable. Another frame captures Brittany and Golden, with the little one flashing a radiant smile in a cute denim romper — a moment that quickly stole fans' hearts.True to their tradition, Patrick and Brittany had earlier decided not to reveal their children’s faces immediately after birth. The couple has always placed high importance on privacy, especially when it comes to their kids. But when they finally shared this sweet family portrait, fans couldn’t stop gushing over how grown and happy the Mahomes family looked.While many are surprised at how young Patrick is to be a father of three, the 29-year-old quarterback has always embraced early parenthood. “No, it’s awesome. I always wanted to have kids young. I got to grow up in the locker room. I think I’ve talked about it before, and it made such an impact on my life,” he once said.Despite his high-pressure role leading the Chiefs, Mahomes never lets family take a backseat. As soon as he wraps up on the field, he’s quick to head home and soak up every moment with Brittany and their children. Fatherhood, as he describes, changed him for the better. Initially, he dreamed of having a son first, but everything shifted when he met his daughter Sterling.“Growing up I wanted to have a boy first, then I had a girl & it’s like God knew exactly what to do with me. He helped me mature as a man. It’s a different bond with a daughter because you’ve got to be that protector,” Mahomes shared during a candid conversation with Tom Brady on NFL on Fox.With every public glimpse of their family life, Patrick and Brittany continue to redefine what it means to balance fame, love, and parenthood — one sweet moment at a time.Also Read: “It affects everything”: Taylor Swift’s alleged falling out with Blake Lively gets deeper — and Travis Kelce may be caught in the crossfire","Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany Mahomes, recently revealed the face of their youngest child, Golden, for the first time.

Deandre Ayton’s Potential Impact in Los Angeles

Risks Involved





Theare always on the hunt for roster upgrades, and a potential trade involving a starting forward could bring them a high-reward big man. According to a recent analysis, swapping Rui Hachimura for former Phoenix Suns starmight be the jackpot move the Lakers need.The Los Angeles Lakers ' search for a dominant big man isn’t new, but finding the right fit is tricky. Blazer’s Edge’s Adrian Bernecich suggests Ayton could be the answer.""In order to maximize ( Luka) Doncic moving forward, the Lakers need a big man who can catch lobs, hit midrange jumpers, rebound at a high level, and play at least average defense,"" Bernecich wrote. ""Sound like anyone we know?"" (H/t Sporting News)Deandre Ayton, who was part of the Damian Lillard trade, has shown flashes of brilliance but struggles with consistency. Still, his skill set aligns well with the Lakers' needs.- Strong pick-and-roll player- Effective in the high post- Reliable rebounder and rim protector- Career averages of 16.1 PPG and 10.4 RPG- Inconsistent motor and effort- Limited three-point range- Defensive lapses at timesFor the Los Angeles Lakers to acquire Deandre Ayton, they’d need to package multiple players to match his $108 million contract. Here’s how the deal could work:Bernecich explains: ""Rui Hachimura is a no-brainer.With only one year left, he’s a rotation forward earning $18.2 million, an amount that gets you halfway there. From here, the Lakers could add Dorian Finney-Smith, which pretty much gets you to Ayton’s number. But my guess is they’d prefer to keep Finney-Smith and opt for one of three $11-to $11.5 million players in Maxi Kleber, Gabe Vincent, or Jarred Vanderbilt. ""Deandre Ayton’s best years came with the Suns, where he played a key role in their 2021 Western Conference Finals run. That season, he averaged:- 14.4 PPG- 10.5 RPG- 1.2 BPG- 62.6% FGIf he regains that form, the Lakers would add a legitimate two-way center who can:- Strengthen interior defense- Provide efficient scoring in the paint- Improve rebounding, a current weaknessWhile Ayton has upside, there are concerns:- Effort and conditioning have been inconsistent- Long-term financial commitment (three years remaining)- May not fit seamlessly with Anthony DavisAyton trading is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. He might be the missing component in the Lakers' frontcourt if they think they can maximize his potential. Giving up Hachimura and other assets, though, is a risk that may either put them in the running or backfire if Ayton continues to act inconsistently.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Phoenix Suns could make bold move on $220,441,984 star; massive blunder or are they cooking?

Josh Allen, the Buffalo Bills' star player, recently tied the knot with the Sinners’ Hailee Steinfeld after dating for two years. The two stars seemed ecstatic at their beautiful California wedding as pictures of Hailee Steinfeld walking down the aisle quickly went viral. Now, Josh Allen has opened up about how marriage has been for him, but it seems like it has sparked a concern among fans.Recently, the Buffalo Bills’ star player and one of the highest paid players in the league spoke about marrying Hailee Steinfeld at a press conference and said, ""They've all been big…None other than marrying my best friend.”Josh Allen added, “She makes everything easier.

Clearly most people are making the wrong choice.”A third fan commented, “If you say you’re marrying your best friend, it’s not gonna last”, while another fan referred to Josh Allen’s previous break up with ex Brittany Williams and wrote, “Didn’t you say the same about Brittney until she kicked your a*s for being a douche bag.”A fifth fan noted, “This isn’t going to age well”.However, neither Josh Allen nor Hailee Steinfeld has responded to the negative concern around their marriage yet.Before their wedding, Hailee Steinfeld was busy promoting her blockbuster movie, Sinners, and was spotted to have a close bond with co-star Michael B.

Jordan.Neither Hailee Steinfeld nor Josh Allen addressed these rumours as the True Grit actress constantly praised the Buffalo Bills’ star player.A few months ago, in an interview with Who What Wear, Hailee Steinfeld spoke about her proposal and said, ""I'm so grateful that he did it the way he did so that I looked good, and we have these photos that we'll have and cherish for the rest of our lives that I'm not looking at being like, 'What was I wearing?'

Image via: Getty Images

Desmond Bane heads to Orlando Magic, forcing the Brooklyn Nets to reconsider Cam Johnson's market value







In a bold shake-up that may define the tempo of this offseason, the Orlando Magic pulled off a headline-grabbing trade to acquire Desmond Bane from the Memphis Grizzlies. The massive deal doesn’t just elevate the Magic's competitive ceiling; it’s also rippling across the league and redefining trade value for shooters like Brooklyn Nets forward Cameron Johnson. As teams reevaluate the cost of acquiring versatile wings, Bane’s high-priced move has inadvertently given Johnson’s market a sharp boost.Desmond Bane’s arrival in Orlando Magic didn’t come cheap. According to ESPN’s Shams Charania, the Magic surrendered Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Cole Anthony, four unprotected first-round picks, and a lightly protected pick swap in 2029. Memphis received the No. 16 selection in this year’s draft, a 2026 first-rounder, plus unprotected picks in 2028 and 2030. While many expected top names like Giannis Antetokounmpo or Zion Williamson to dominate the market, Orlando’s stealthy acquisition of Bane now appears just as impactful.“Over his five years in the NBA, Desmond has distinguished himself as one of the elite guards in our league, and we look forward to his shooting, IQ and wide-ranging skill set in helping our team take a step forward,"" said Magic president Jeff Weltman.“Desmond’s character is held in high regard across the league and we believe he will fit seamlessly with our existing players both on and off the court,” he added. Bane is a 41% career shooter from deep and joins Stephen Curry as the only players since 2020 to make 800 threes while maintaining that efficiency.His arrival gives the Magic a vital offensive upgrade without compromising their identity as a tough, defensive-minded unit. That’s bad news for Eastern Conference contenders like the Boston Celtics, who are expected to be without Jayson Tatum for a large chunk of next season due to a torn Achilles. The Bucks are also in a precarious position with Damian Lillard sidelined and Giannis Antetokounmpo’s future uncertain.All of this has direct implications for Cameron Johnson. He was considered a solid starter, and now, Johnson’s value is surging in light of Bane’s blockbuster trade. A Bleacher Report piece noted that “the Nets likely want more than a single first-rounder in return for the 29-year-old forward.” Teams like the Cleveland Cavaliers, who are rumored to be eyeing Johnson, may now need to overpay in draft capital just to stay competitive.Also Read: NBA Trade Rumors: Dallas Mavericks might sign $29,936,173 Indiana Pacers to bolster squad; Myles Turner key trade asset? Johnson’s evolution from a perceived reach in the 2019 NBA Draft to a sought-after floor spacer has come full circle. Now, Johnson, who has been a key contributor in Brooklyn, may be the next shooter to command a heavy return.With his old No. 22 retired in Orlando, Bane will now wear No. 3 as he starts this next chapter. The jersey switch marks a fresh beginning for both him and the franchise.","Orlando Magic traded Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Cole Anthony, four unprotected first-round picks, and a lightly protected pick swap in 2029.

Tom Brady once bonded with Josh Allen’s dad on the golf course







What began as another star-studded day at the 2024 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am turned into a touching sports moment when NFL legend Tom Brady met Josh Allen’s father. Although the former New England Patriots quarterback built a legacy dominating the Buffalo Bills during his career, his heartfelt exchange with Joel Allen, father of the Bills’ franchise QB, brought a surprisingly wholesome twist to their long-standing rivalry.Tom Brady, participating in the tournament alongside Josh Allen and six other current or former athletes, had a brief but powerful exchange with Joel Allen before teeing off. What he said was enough to melt even the hardest hearts among the Buffalo faithful. “I love your son, but you already knew that. He’s a great kid,” Brady told Allen’s dad, smiling warmly.Coming from the man who tormented Buffalo fans for nearly two decades—compiling a staggering 33-3 record against the Bills, dominating the AFC East with 17 division titles in 19 seasons, and retiring with seven Super Bowl rings—that kind of praise wasn’t expected, but certainly appreciated.Now retired from football, Brady is finding new ways to interact with today’s stars. While Josh Allen continues to steer the Bills to prominence, winning four consecutive AFC East titles since Brady’s move to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020, their paths no longer cross on the field. Instead, friendly competitions like the Pebble Beach Pro-Am have become the new battleground.The clip of Brady’s exchange with Allen’s father quickly spread across social media, drawing admiration from both fans and pundits.For Bills Mafia, long known for its passionate disdain for Brady, the gesture marked a rare moment of mutual respect. It’s not often you see the quarterback who used to crush your playoff dreams praise your current hero with such sincerity.While Allen has yet to register a win against Brady—going 0-4 in head-to-head matchups—the admiration from the GOAT speaks volumes. Brady’s praise wasn’t just lip service. It was a genuine acknowledgment of the talent, leadership, and resilience Allen brings to the field every week.Brady’s interaction may not erase the painful memories he left behind in Buffalo, but it certainly bridged the gap between the past and the present. In a sport where rivalries often linger long past retirement, moments like these remind us that mutual respect can turn old wounds into shared admiration.And maybe, just maybe, Brady’s words were enough to earn a few nods of approval from the most diehard Bills fans.Also Read: Throwback to when Patrick Mahomes got candid about being a proud girl dad for the first time: “I Wanted to Have a Boy First”","NFL legend Tom Brady met Josh Allen’s father at the 2024 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro- Am.

Mutual Respect Between Durant and Edwards

Challenges and Cap Considerations





The NBA offseason is heating up, and one of the biggest storylines isfuture. After a disappointing playoff run with the Phoenix Suns, trade rumors are swirling, and the Minnesota Timberwolves have emerged as a potential landing spot.According to ESPN Front Office Insider Bobby Marks, a blockbuster trade could send Durant to Minnesota, pairing him with rising star Anthony Edwards. The proposed deal would shake up both teams’ rosters and give the Timberwolves a legitimate championship contender.The hypothetical trade outlined by Marks would involve multiple players and picks:- Kevin Durant- Rudy Gobert- Donte DiVincenzo- Mike Conley- 2025 1st-round pick (17th overall)This trade would address key needs for both teams. The Suns, struggling to find a long-term solution at center, would get Gobert—a four-time Defensive Player of the Year. DiVincenzo adds depth as a reliable two-way player, while Conley’s expiring contract helps Phoenix clear future cap space.For Minnesota, acquiring Durant would be a franchise-altering move.If the trade goes through, Minnesota’s starting five could look like this:This lineup assumes Randle and Reid return (both have player options).The combination of Edwards and Durant would create one of the most dynamic scoring duos in the league.- Anthony Edwards – A rising superstar with elite scoring and athleticism.- Kevin Durant – A proven champion and one of the greatest scorers in NBA history.- Julius Randle & Naz Reid – Versatile big men who can stretch the floor.- Terrance Shannon Jr. – A promising young guard who showed flashes as a rookie.The Timberwolves would have elite scoring at every position, along with improved floor spacing and pick-and-roll versatility.The chemistry between Durant and Edwards is already strong. Edwards has openly admired Durant, calling him his favorite player.""Who I look to for advice? Of course KD, that’s my favorite player of all time, anything I wanna ask I go straight to him,"" Edwards said last year when the two were teammates on the Olympic squad.This existing relationship could make the transition seamless, giving Minnesota a lethal offensive duo.While the trade is enticing, the Timberwolves face financial hurdles:- They are a first-apron team, limiting their flexibility.- Player options for Randle and Reid could impact cap space.- Integrating Durant while maintaining depth won’t be easy.Still, if Minnesota is serious about contending, this move could push them into title contention.The Timberwolves have a real shot at landing Kevin Durant. Pairing him with Anthony Edwards would instantly make them a top-tier team in the West. While the trade would cost them key pieces like Gobert and a first-round pick, the payoff could be worth it.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to acquire 6-feet-8 New Orleans Pelicans big man to support LeBron-Luka power duo As the offseason unfolds, all eyes will be on Phoenix and Minnesota to see if this blockbuster deal comes to life.","The Minnesota Timberwolves have emerged as a potential landing spot for Kevin Durant.

Breaking Down the Potential Contract

What’s Next for the Mavericks?





Theface a crucial offseason decision that could shape their future—whether to commit $113 million toafter his ACL tear. With free agency looming, the franchise must weigh risks and rewards to keep their championship window open. Kyrie Irving’s tenure with the Dallas Mavericks has been a mix of brilliance and uncertainty. After joining Dallas in a mid-season trade two years ago, he formed a dynamic duo with Luka Doncic, leading the team to the NBA Finals in 2024. But a torn ACL in March 2025 has complicated his free agency.Irving holds a $43.9 million player option for next season. Most analysts expect him to decline it and test free agency, but his injury and age (33) make his market unpredictable. ESPN’s Bobby Marks predicts the Mavericks will offer a three-year, $113 million deal—slightly less annually than his current option but with long-term security.As Marks noted: ""A three-year deal would perfectly align him with Anthony Davis’ contract, marking a clear window for this era of the Mavericks."" (H/t: Sporting News)Despite the injury risk, Dallas has strong reasons to retain Irving:- Playoff Pedigree: Proven performer in high-pressure situations.- Chemistry with Doncic: Their partnership already delivered a Finals appearance.- Veteran Leadership: Critical for a team with championship aspirations.However, his durability remains a concern.Here’s how Irving’s projected deal compares to his current option:Here's the converted data into pointers (bullet points):Contract Type:- Player Option (2025)- Proposed ExtensionTotal Value:- $43.9M (Player Option)- $113M (Proposed Extension)Annual Average:- $43.9M (Player Option)- ~$37.6M (Proposed Extension)Guaranteed Years:- 1 (Player Option)- 3 (Proposed Extension)The lower annual salary gives Dallas flexibility to add supporting pieces while keeping their core intact.If Irving re-signs, the Mavericks can focus on:1. Adding Defensive Help: A wing stopper or rim protector.2. Bench Scoring: More reliable options behind Doncic and Irving.3. Health Management: Ensuring both stars are playoff-ready.If talks stall, Dallas may explore sign-and-trade scenarios, but losing Irving for nothing would be a major setback.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Dallas Mavericks might sign $29,936,173 Indiana Pacers to bolster squad; Mykes Turner key trade asset?

"No apology coming: Peyton Manning breaks silence on Donald Trump photo, says he won’t apologize for being respectful",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/no-apology-coming-peyton-manning-breaks-silence-on-donald-trump-photo-says-he-wont-apologize-for-being-respectful/articleshow/121871085.cms,"Peyton Manning addresses Trump photo uproar, says he was just being polite (Imagn Images)

Peyton Manning refuses to backtrack on Trump photo, calls it a gesture of respect







Peyton Manning has never been one to get dragged into political drama, and he isn’t starting now. A recently resurfaced photo of the legendary quarterback alongside Donald Trump Jr. has reignited chatter on social media, but Manning seems completely unbothered by the noise.The image in question—originally taken in 2016—shows the Hall of Famer casually posing with Trump Jr. during what appeared to be a non-political event. It gained traction again recently, amassing over 5,000 likes on X (formerly Twitter), with users weighing in amid an increasingly polarized political climate.Despite the attention, Manning has made it clear he’s not offering any apology or explanation. A source close to him revealed his response: “I’ve taken thousands of photos with people over the years. I’m not in the business of explaining every one of them.” For someone who’s kept his political leanings mostly private throughout his post-NFL life, his response is true to form.Although Manning has rarely spoken publicly about his politics, campaign finance records do suggest a longstanding support for the Republican Party.According to the Federal Election Commission, the former Colts and Broncos quarterback has donated $17,900 to GOP candidates since 2004. His contributions include $7,300 to Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign and $2,700 to Jeb Bush’s 2016 primary challenge against Donald Trump.Still, unlike other high-profile athletes who have publicly distanced themselves from the Trump family or GOP politics, Peyton Manning has maintained a neutral public posture. His approach has always been to avoid the outrage cycles that dominate today’s media ecosystem.Instead, Manning has channeled his post-football energy into building an impressive media career. He runs Omaha Productions, the company behind ESPN’s popular Manningcast broadcast, which he co-hosts with brother Eli Manning. Beyond sports commentary, he's delving into scripted entertainment, working on a “Chad Powers” series with actor Glen Powell.While the political world continues to shift, Manning remains rooted in the things he knows best—football, family, and storytelling. His consistency and calm demeanor have helped him navigate both athletic fame and celebrity status without getting tangled in controversy.Even as the 2016 photo recirculates, the two-time Super Bowl champion isn’t blinking. His career speaks for itself: from rewriting NFL records to redefining sports media, Peyton Manning has nothing to prove. As one of football’s most respected figures, his silence on the matter isn’t a dodge—it’s a decision to let his legacy speak louder than politics.Also Read: Watch: When Tom Brady made Josh Allen’s dad smile big at a Pro-Am golf event— and it's still a fan-favorite clip","Peyton Manning has never been one to get dragged into political drama, and he isn't starting now.

Gabriella Zuniga’s explicit content offer raises public and legal questions

Legal teams release conflicting evidence in heated court battle

Career fallout and postponed projects for Shannon Sharpe







The legal battle between former NFL star Shannon Sharpe and OnlyFans creator Gabriella Zuniga has taken an even more sensational turn. Zuniga, also known online as ""Karli,"" is now offering a s*x tape to subscribers who tip over $2,000—despite being in the midst of a $50 million lawsuit against Sharpe, which includes serious allegations of sexual assault, emotional abuse, and coercion.At just 21 years old, OnlyFans star Gabriella Zuniga’s decision to promote adult content while pursuing a high-profile legal case has ignited a firestorm of debate online. Critics argue her move could damage her credibility and shift public perception of the lawsuit. Supporters counter that she’s continuing her career as an adult content creator, independent of the case at hand.Notably, Gabriella Zuniga has not confirmed whether the tape involves Sharpe, a point that adds ambiguity and intrigue to an already explosive case. Given the legal implications, it seems unlikely she would directly tie the content to the former athlete, though the timing of her announcement has undeniably complicated the narrative.Represented by high-profile attorney Tony Buzbee—known for taking on Deshaun Watson and Sean “Diddy” Combs—Zuniga alleges a disturbing pattern of manipulation by Sharpe. This includes claims of non-consensual recordings and threats of violence.Buzbee released audio recordings in which Sharpe allegedly states he would ""choke"" her, painting a picture of abuse behind the scenes.Sharpe, 56, has firmly denied all allegations through his lawyer, Lanny Davis, calling the lawsuit “an extortion attempt.” In response, Davis released explicit messages that appear to show a consensual relationship between the two. One message reportedly even features Zuniga expressing a desire to have Sharpe’s child.According to court documents, the two met at a Los Angeles gym in 2023, when Zuniga was just 19. She claims their relationship evolved from flirtation to deep emotional and psychological distress.The scandal has already had serious career repercussions for Sharpe. Once on the brink of signing a $100 million media deal, the NFL Hall of Famer has since stepped away from First Take and postponed his Nightcap podcast tour with co-host Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson.“We’ve decided to postpone the Nightcap tour,” Sharpe stated. “We look forward to seeing you guys in the summer of 2026. It’s going to be even bigger, even better.”Also Read: “Sh*t on their shoes”: Erin Andrews disgusted and blasts ‘trashy’ women for public restroom selfies Despite planning a return to ESPN for the 2025-26 season, Sharpe’s future now hinges on the outcome of this high-stakes legal battle.","Gabriella Zuniga, 21, is offering a s*x tape to subscribers who tip over $2,000.

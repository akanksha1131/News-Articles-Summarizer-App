'India are always there near the end,' says Tim Southee on Champions Trophy chances

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has strongly criticised the team's approach in the recently concluded tri-nation series, particularly questioning the decision to have Babar Azam open the innings. His comments came after Pakistan's five-wicket loss to New Zealand in the final at Karachi's National Stadium on Friday.""If you had won the tri-nation series, then your confidence level would have been high, every boy's confidence level would have been high,"" Basit said on his YouTube channel. ""Who is the one who told Babar Azam to open? I am surprised who he is. What crazy people they are [Kaise pagal log hai]. He was performing well at number three, scoring 50-70 against South Africa, but they stopped that too. Now, just 62 runs in three matches in the tri-series. This is the approach, this is the thinking,"" he lamented.Pakistan will face New Zealand again in their Champions Trophy opener on Wednesday. Basit emphasised that the team should have focused on their first match rather than looking ahead to their clash against India. ""We keep talking about India's match, but we had to think about New Zealand first. Will this team play against them? Will the pitch be like this? Will Salman Agha bowl 10 overs? Will you make Khushdil Shah play?"" he questioned.He also suggested that captain Mohammad Rizwan was not fully confident in the squad, particularly regarding Faheem Ashraf. ""Rizwan clearly showed he is not happy with Faheem Ashraf coming into the team. He did not give him the ball after just two overs, only using him again when the match was already lost,"" Basit remarked.Reiterating his point about Babar’s batting position, Basit drew a comparison with Sachin Tendulkar but insisted Pakistan had mishandled their star batter. ""They say even Sachin opened the innings and scored a century in his first match in Sri Lanka. But you removed Babar from No.3, where he was excelling, and now you've destroyed his rhythm,"" he added.Basit concluded by stressing the importance of confidence heading into a major tournament. ""Winning this tri-nation series could have boosted morale. Now, what will be your confidence? Cricket is a total game of confidence, and if that is shaken, you are left behind,"" he warned.Pakistan will look to regroup as they prepare for their Champions Trophy campaign, starting with a rematch against New Zealand at the same venue on February 19.",Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has strongly criticised the team's approach in the recently concluded tri-nation series.

Champions Trophy: Will India and South Africa clash in another ICC final?

'India are always there near the end,' says Tim Southee on Champions Trophy chances

NEW DELHI: Ellyse Perry and Richa Ghosh delivered powerful half-centuries as Royal Challengers Bengaluru achieved a historic Women's Premier League victory, successfully chasing down 202 runs to defeat Gujarat Giants on Friday. Perry (57, 34b, 6x4, 2x6) and Ghosh (64 not out, 27b, 7x4, 4x6) displayed exceptional batting prowess in the tournament's opening match.RCB faced early setbacks, losing both openers Smriti Mandhana (9) and Danny Wyatt (4) to Ashleigh Gardner in the second over, leaving them at 14 for two.The partnership between Perry and Raghavi Bist (25, 27b) yielded 86 runs, stabilising the innings until Bist fell to Deandra Dottin.Perry, who received a lifeline when dropped on 19, capitalised on the opportunity against the Giants' imprecise bowling attack.Despite nursing a hip injury from the recent Women's Ashes, Perry reached her fifty off 27 balls with a six against Dottin.Following Perry's dismissal by Sayali Satghare, Ghosh and Kanika Ahuja (30 not out, 13b, 4x4) took control of the chase.Their unbroken 93-run partnership, featuring Ghosh's 23-ball fifty, proved decisive as RCB secured victory, scoring 64 runs in the final five overs.Earlier, Gujarat Giants posted 201/5, powered by captain Gardner's explosive 79 off 37 balls (3x4, 8x6) and Beth Mooney's composed 56 off 42 (8x4).After losing Wolvaardt and Hemalatha with 41 runs on board, Mooney and Gardner steadied the innings with a 44-run partnership before Mooney fell to Prema Rawat.Gardner and Dottin (25, 13b, 3x4, 1x6) accelerated the scoring with a rapid 67-run partnership.Gardner's aggressive approach contrasted with Mooney's technical batting, as she dominated both spin and pace, particularly targeting Prema and VJ Joshitha for three sixes each.The innings concluded with Dottin's dismissal by Renuka Singh whilst attempting an aggressive shot.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Gujarat Giants in Champions Trophy.

'India are always there near the end,' says Tim Southee on Champions Trophy chances

Australia's stand-in skipper Steve Smith remains confident about his team's prospects at the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 , despite a 2-0 ODI series loss to Sri Lanka.Australia, plagued by selection setbacks, entered the series without key players Pat Cummins Josh Hazlewood , and Mitchell Marsh , all sidelined due to injuries. With Mitchell Starc unavailable and Marcus Stoinis having retired from ODIs earlier this year, the squad underwent significant changes. The makeshift Australian side struggled, suffering consecutive defeats in Sri Lanka - failing to chase 215 in the first ODI and collapsing for 107 in pursuit of 282 in the second.Despite the disappointing results, Smith backed the team's bowling attack, particularly the pacers who have stepped up in the absence of senior players.""I think they've all got their own unique skills,"" Smith said. ""For me, captaining them, it's about me communicating with them and trying to get the right option out of them at the right time.""They all do it differently - Ben Dwarshius and Spencer Johnson up-top trying to swing the ball back down the line. Sean (Abbott) has terrific lengths, Nathan Ellis has change-ups.""With spin expected to play a crucial role in Pakistan, where the Champions Trophy will be held, Smith expressed confidence in Australia's resources.""Yeah, we've got a couple of spinners as well with (Adam) Zampa and Tanveer (Sangha), who's got a good skill set,"" he noted. ""[In] Maxwell and Short, we've got plenty of part-time options.""Smith also weighed in on Jake Fraser-McGurk, one of the latest inclusions in Australia's Champions Trophy squad. The 22-year-old, known for his aggressive batting, struggled in the Sri Lanka series, managing just 2 and 9 in his two outings. However, Smith backed him to find his rhythm in Pakistan.""He's obviously a very aggressive player. He's got all the shots around the ground,"" Smith said. ""It's just about picking the right time to play them. He hasn't quite gotten going yet, but he played a couple of nice shots out there, and we know the talent he possesses. That's why he's in this squad. He's dangerous, and the wickets in Pakistan suit him.""Australia will begin their Champions Trophy campaign against England in Lahore on February 22.",Australia lost 2-0 to Sri Lanka in ODI series.

Responding to Brighton's impressive 3-0 victory at the Amex Stadium on Friday, Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca acknowledged it as the ""worst performance"" under his leadership, with Japanese talent Kaoru Mitoma delivering a spectacular Premier League goal.The lacklustre Chelsea side failed to register any shots on target, marking their second loss within a week at the venue.Fresh from scoring the decisive goal in Brighton's 2-1 FA Cup triumph over Chelsea the previous weekend, Mitoma continued to shine. His remarkable first-half display of skill preceded Gambian winger Yankuba Minteh's double strike.Having arrived from Leicester, Maresca's inaugural season included recent statements about Chelsea's rightful place in the Champions League , aligning with the club's two-year qualification objective.The recent defeat, their third in four matches across all competitions, has dampened their top-four aspirations.""I constantly feel pressure, but today's performance stands out as the poorest since my arrival,"" Maresca stated. ""This result brings complete frustration. We deeply regret disappointing our travelling supporters.""The manager faces the crucial task of addressing Chelsea's defensive vulnerabilities if the fourth-placed team, currently leading Manchester City and Newcastle by two points, aims to achieve their seasonal objectives.Maresca elaborated: ""In our current position, with an opportunity to extend our lead over pursuing teams, tonight's performance highlights numerous areas requiring improvement. However, we maintain fourth position and remain competitive for a strong finish.""Brighton, who suffered a 7-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest in their last league encounter and had secured only two victories in their previous twelve top-flight matches, have regained momentum with consecutive wins against Chelsea.Cole Palmer's early-season prowess, yielding six goals in seven initial league appearances followed by eight more (including two penalties) in seventeen subsequent matches, has notably diminished.Chelsea's trajectory has shifted from potential title challengers to top-four contenders as Palmer's form cooled. His struggles continued with wayward attempts before Noni Madueke's injury-enforced departure compounded Chelsea's fitness concerns.Brighton's opening goal showcased Mitoma's brilliance, expertly controlling Bart Verbruggen's goal-kick before outmanoeuvring Trevoh Chalobah and finishing precisely.Despite Enzo Fernandez's disallowed header due to a clear push, Brighton extended their lead through Minteh, capitalising on Chelsea's defensive errors. The third goal arrived from Minteh's skilled finish following Danny Welbeck's contribution, despite Chelsea's protests about a possible foul on Levi Colwill.","Brighton beat Chelsea 3-0 at the Amex Stadium on Friday night.

Former captain Babar Azam and his poor form remain central to cricket debates in Pakistan ahead of the ODI tri-series final against New Zealand on Friday and the ICC Champions Trophy that follows, while the team management decided to push the star batter up the order as an opener.Asking Babar to open and his failure in that position in the two matches of the tri-series has led to polarized opinion on the move ahead of the team's Champions Trophy title defence on home soil.Had Saim Ayub been fit, Pakistan would not have thought of using Babar as an opener, allowing him to bat in his normal position in the middle order.On the eve of the tri-series final in Karachi, captain Mohammad Rizwan shared the team's theory behind the decision, besides trying to fill the void created by Ayub's injury.""His (Ayub's) absence created a huge disturbance, and we went for the safety of Babar Azam, who's our best batter,"" said Rizwan. ""At the top, if the ball swings, he can control it. When Abdullah Shafique got out early in South Africa, Babar had to deal with the new ball anyway. He was coping with the seam and swing and enabling us to attack at the end. So we thought why not go for our most technically solid player to open, rather than throwing someone else in at the deep end.""Babar scored 10 in the tri-series opener against New Zealand in Lahore and 23 in the next match against South Africa in Karachi.""Babar has achieved so much that we are expecting him to score a hundred in every match. He has made a big name; but if you look at him with a normal lens, he is still contributing with handy knocks,"" Rizwan added.""It's not as if he is doing something drastically different, but he is still getting out. Luck has evaded him. I am confident he'll come out of it.""",Babar Azam's poor form has led to polarized opinion in Pakistan cricket.

What does Shubman Gill's horoscope say about his captaincy future

AHMEDABAD: It's the fourth ball of the eighth over in the third ODI, and opener Shubman Gill is walking down the track to England pacer Saqib Mahmood. Mahmood and fellow pacer Mark Wood, who has already accounted for captain Rohit Sharma , have been consistently trying to hit the lengths which will deprive batters room to hit their shots.Gill, though, is a step ahead. The walk down the pitch allows him to manoeuvre the length, free his arms and hit the ball over wide mid-on. Gill oozes class, and he repeats the shot often during his innings.His methods help him bring up his seventh ODI ton, a wellmade 112 which helps India amass 356, in reply to which England are bowled out for 214.The same shot, however, had led to Gill's downfall in the second innings on a more livelier Sydney pitch, in the fifth Test against Australia in January. Gill had danced down the track to debutant pacer Beau Webster, only to see him get an edge which was gobbled up by wicketkeeper Alex Carey.Gill, it appears, has worked on the shot since then. Former India player and Gill's Punjab teammate Gurkeerat Singh Mann, who watched him train after returning from Australia, says Gill rectified some mistakes by repeatedly practising the shot in the nets. ""One thing about Gill's game and his nature is that he won't drop or remove the shot from his arsenal. He will perfect it. He will see where we went wrong while playing the shot, work on it and keep attempting it till he perfects it,"" Mann told TOI.Mann said Gill focused on maintaining his head position both while the ball was being delivered and at the moment of connection. ""He would ensure his head would not fall down, feet were aligned and his balance was maintained,"" Mann said. ""Gill missed out on a century in the first two matches so a century was always on the cards.""India's head coach Gautam Gambhir too praised Gill's approach and welcome return to form ahead of the Champions Trophy . Asked what has worked well for Gill in ODIs, a format in which he has shown remarkable consistency unlike in Tests, Gambhir retorted, ""The problem is that we keep judging people after every inning. He's still a young batter, still 25. He's got a great future ahead of him. He's been consistent in one format. Test cricket is tough cricket and he's shown that he belongs to that format as well. I hope that going ahead, he can actually deliver in that format as well.""""If someone can do it in 50-over cricket, why can't he do it in Test cricket as well? He's played some really good innings in the Test format as well. So by judging a young cricketer after every inning, we're not going to carry Indian cricket forward. You've got to start putting trust in these young players. Imagine what can happen in the next couple of years if we keep backing him and keep backing a lot of young cricketers in that dressing room. That is something we need to be clear about,"" Gambhir added.""Rohit Sharma said he likes batting with Gill as he maintains his game irrespective of how Sharma goes about his own run-scoring at the top of the order,"" Mann said, ""When the time comes for the greats to retire, the transition will be smooth with the likes of Gill around."" For now, Gill's form will be crucial for India heading into the Champions Trophy",Shubman Gill scores his seventh ODI century against England in Ahmedabad. The 25-year-old has shown remarkable consistency in 50-over cricket.

""But as players, you need to stay calm, try and block that noise out, and just play with the same intensity as you would play Australia or any other team.""He expressed confidence in Pakistan’s ability to defend their title under captain Mohammad Rizwan . ""Pakistan have a really good chance of defending that title and I think they have a strong team. Some of the boys from 2017 are still there and we’re talking about some of the best – especially Babar Azam ""He is a different Babar to the one that played in 2017, a more mature player and a dominant player in the game.

'We don't look at averages and stats': Gautam Gambhir on sending Axar Patel at No. 5

AHMEDABAD: Head coach Gautam Gambhir has dismissed speculation that India only played Shreyas Iyer in the first ODI against England because Virat Kohli was injured. Iyer, as it turned out, was in excellent form throughout the series, starting with a 36-ball 59 with India in early trouble in Nagpur. He followed that up with 44 and 78 in the next two matches.Gambhir said Iyer had always been in the ""scheme of things"" and will be an ""important player"" heading into the Champions Trophy After the Nagpur ODI, Iyer had revealed that he was played only because Kohli’s knee had acted up, and that he had been informed only the night before the game.Gambhir cleared the air by saying, ""He wasn’t supposed to be benched throughout the series. We wanted to give Yashasvi (Jaiswal) a go in the first game and see what he can bring to the table because he was in really good form in Australia.""Jaiswal, however, was subsequently dropped to enable Iyer to retain his place in the side. ""I know that you can’t judge someone (Jaiswal) by one innings. But we always knew that Shreyas was going to be an important player for us. Sometimes when you’ve only got three games, you want to try and rotate your squad as well.""When you’ve got Champions Trophy around the corner, you want to try and maximise these three games and try and give everyone an opportunity. But Shreyas was always in the scheme of things (and it is) good that he played all the three games,"" Gambhir added.Asked about his broader view on the effectiveness of left-right combinations, Gambhir said, ""That’s the way cricket is meant to be played. It’s not about the batting order, it’s about who can create what impact. It’s about putting a quality left-hander in the middle.""","Gautam Gambhir says Shreyas Iyer would not have been benched all series. Iyer played in first ODI because Virat Kohli's knee had acted up.

New Zealand fast bowler Ben Sears has been ruled out of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 due to a hamstring injury. The Blackcaps pacer experienced discomfort in his left hamstring during the team’s first training session in Karachi on Wednesday, and scans later confirmed a minor tear requiring at least two weeks of rehabilitation.With the tournament’s short duration, Sears would likely have been available only for New Zealand’s final Group A match against India in Dubai. Given the circumstances, the team management has decided to replace him with Otago Volts bowler Jacob Duffy , who is already in Pakistan as part of the squad for the ongoing ODI Tri-Series against Pakistan and South Africa.New Zealand head coach Gary Stead expressed disappointment over Sears’ injury, particularly as this was set to be his first major ICC event. “We’re all really feeling for Ben,” Stead said. “It’s always tough being ruled out of a major event at such a late stage, and it’s especially tough in Ben’s case given it would have been his first major ICC event.”Stead emphasised that the decision to bring in Duffy was based on the need for a fully fit player. “The timeframes for Ben to be fit to play again meant he would likely miss the majority of the group stage, and given the short nature of the tournament, we felt it was appropriate to bring in a player who is fully fit and ready to go.”Despite the setback, Stead remains optimistic about Sears’ return to cricket. “Ben is a player with huge potential, and given the short rehabilitation timeframe, we’re sure he’ll be fit and raring to go for the home series against Pakistan back in New Zealand.”Duffy, who impressed in the recent home series against Sri Lanka, now joins the squad as Sears’ replacement. Stead praised the 29-year-old’s capabilities. “Jacob showed with his performances in the recent home series against Sri Lanka that he is more than capable at international level. He’s been part of the squad for the ODI Tri-Series, so he’s fully acclimatised, and he’s got plenty of experience in these conditions. He’s fit and ready to go.”With this being Duffy’s first senior ICC event, Stead noted that it would be an exciting opportunity for the bowler. “He’s another player who will be experiencing his first senior ICC event, so it will be an exciting few weeks ahead for him.”The Blackcaps begin their Champions Trophy campaign in the tournament opener against hosts Pakistan on Wednesday.Mitchell Santner (c), Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell , Will O’Rourke, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Jacob Duffy, Nathan Smith, Kane Williamson, Will Young.","New Zealand fast bowler Ben Sears has been ruled out of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 due to a hamstring injury.

Champions Trophy: Will India and South Africa clash in another ICC final?

NEW DELHI: India, New Zealand, Bangladesh and Pakistan are in the same group for the ICC Champions Trophy , scheduled to take place from February 19 to March 9, across Pakistan and Dubai. India will begin their campaign in Dubai on February 20 against Bangladesh, followed by a high-stakes clash with Pakistan on February 23, before facing New Zealand on March 2.Former New Zealand pacer Tim Southee , who recently announced his retirement from international cricket, called India as strong contenders and wouldn’t mind seeing them face the BlackCaps in the final.""It'd be nice. India are a strong side when it comes to world events and are always there near the end. So yeah, I'm sure they'll be a dangerous side throughout, and hopefully, New Zealand will be there as well. I hope New Zealand makes it to the final,"" Southee told TimesofIndia.com in an interview.Since its inception in 1998, India have won the Champions Trophy twice.The first title came in 2002 when, under Sourav Ganguly’s captaincy, India and Sri Lanka were declared joint winners after the final in Colombo was washed out.The second title came in 2013, with MS Dhoni leading India to victory, beating hosts England in the final.India came close again in 2017, reaching the final but falling short against arch-rivals Pakistan.Meanwhile, New Zealand, a team known for exceeding expectations in major tournaments, claimed their only Champions Trophy title in 2000. Led by Stephen Fleming, they secured a memorable four-wicket victory over India in the final.The last high-stakes ICC clash between India and New Zealand took place in the World Test Championship final, where the Kiwis outclassed India by eight wickets to lift the trophy.""It's a great tournament, with the top eight sides competing for the trophy. It's a short, sharp tournament, and it always has been. I've always enjoyed the ones I've played in. So, hopefully, New Zealand can do well in that and, I guess, add to our silverware,"" Southee said.""We have a great group of players coming through—players who have played a lot of cricket together. I think the ability to play as a team in world events, as well as in other games, is crucial. So I think, yeah, it's about the style of play we've developed and having a group of players who have spent a lot of time playing together,"" he said.","India, New Zealand, Bangladesh and Pakistan are in the same group for the ICC Champions Trophy.

Not much swing and not much in the deck,"" Bennett said.""Benny (Bennett) batted extremely well, with perfect tempo. You have to capitalise on your chances, and he did.

We gave him a chance or two, and he punished us. We were rusty when we should not have been.""The wicket was as good as it gets at Harare Sports Club.

And I think this is a huge achievement for Pakistan, to win in Australia against Australia and then in South Africa against South Africa,"" Amir said during an exclusive conversation withThe left-arm fast bowler pointed out that Pakistan's strong performances abroad have given them an edge as the Champions Trophy is set to take place in Pakistan.""Since the Champions Trophy is in Pakistan, it will be an advantage for Pakistan, so I think Pakistan can do really well,"" he added on the sidelines of ILT20, where Amir's Desert Vipers ended up with the runners-up medal.Amir also labelled the event as a ""festival"" for the entire nation.""This is a huge thing for the entire country of Pakistan.

The Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) has received its third FIFA ban since 2017, which has jeopardized its men's national team's participation in the 2027 Asian Cup qualifying campaign.On January 25, the PFF Congress had dismissed constitutional amendments proposed jointly by FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), which had led to the latest ban, after similar sanctions in 2017 for five months and in 2021 for 14 months.In 2017 and 2021, FIFA imposed bans on Pakistan following external interference in PFF operations. FIFA established a Normalization Committee in 2019 to oversee Pakistan football and conduct PFF elections. The committee continues to function as elections remain pending.""It's not surprising anymore as there are power struggles in Pakistan football with people promoting themselves and not caring about the game,"" Pakistan player Navid Rahman told The Associated Press. ""Also FIFA and the AFC should take some of the blame as this is a recurring issue which should have been sorted out before.""The sport has faced significant challenges domestically, with the absence of a national league since 2019.""As soon as there is a little traction that develops in Pakistan football, then something happens,"" Rahman said.

Goa end 13-game winless run against Mumbai in style,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/goa-end-13-game-winless-run-against-mumbai-in-style/articleshow/118199431.cms,"MUMBAI: It was the moment which summed up Mumbai City's miserable night. Already trailing 2-0 - not for the first time at the Mumbai Football Arena this season - any faint hopes of a comeback against an FC Goa side oozing confidence were killed after a terrible blunder by centre half Mehtab Singh in the 64th minute.Goa winger Udanta Singh, who had already tormented Mumbai's lacklustre backline a fair bit by then, picked up a clearance by Islanders goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa and sent in a cross. Seemingly unsure what to do with it, Mehtab ended up heading the ball perfectly into the path of the lurking Borja Herrera Gonzalez who calmly slotted past Lachenpa at the near post. 3-0, game as good as over!In a fixture where pre-match story lines revolved around players facing their past, Spanish striker Iker Guarrotxena , who had an unfortunate short-lived stint at the Islanders last season, returned to haunt his former team, scoring twice for Goa in the first half. An injury-time penalty put away by captain Lallianzuala Chhangte was all Mumbai could console themselves with in the end.For the visitors, the 3-1 result was an emphatic way to end a horrendous 13-match winless streak against Mumbai in the Indian Super League . It also helped Manolo Marquez 's side consolidate second place (39 pts) in the standings, and perhaps, keep alive their faint hopes of catching runaway leaders Mohun Bagan SG (46 pts) in the race for the League Winners Shield.For the hosts, who remain fifth (31 pts), it was another evening to forget at the Arena. They did go into the game having beaten Mohammedan SC 3-0 before playing out a goalless draw with East Bengal in their last two outings here. But whenever they have taken on teams above them in the table, it's often been a struggle, and sure enough, Petr Kratky's side sank to their fourth home defeat of the season.The absence of the injured Greek striker Nikolaos Karelis does seem to be weighing on the reigning ISL Cup holders as Kratky decided to give Jan signing Jorge Ortiz his first start.Barring one effort on target late in the first half and a couple of moments in the second, the Spanish forward wasn't quite able to inspire Mumbai against his old team. For that matter, neither could Brandon Fernandes, who switched to Mumbai after seven seasons with his hometown side last summer, and was loudly jeered by his old fans in the away stand every time he touched the ball.Guarrotxena, though, had the most enjoyable evening of the three men on the pitch who were taking on their former teams. After picking up an Udanta pass across the edge of the box and placing a right-footed finish through a crowd of blue shirts into the bottom right corner for his first (24th), he then neatly turned in the winger's cross on the half volley to double Goa's lead in the 41st minute.",Goa end 13-match winless streak against Mumbai with 3-1 win. Iker Guarrotxena scores twice for Goa. Borja Herrera Gonzalez and Lallianzuala Chhangte also on target for visitors. Petr Kratky's side suffer fourth home defeat of season.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118199392,imgsize-46182,width-400,resizemode-4/118199392.jpg"

Overall, it's a really great result,"" said Bayern coach Vincent Kompany , according to the BBC.After suffering their first home loss since December 2023, Celtic will have a difficult time trying to win the match in Germany on Tuesday. The winner will advance to play either Bayer Leverkusen or Atletico Madrid in the round of 16.""It's only a one goal difference. It's a big challenge, we know that but it's still a possibility,"" insisted Rodgers.Benfica defeated Monaco 1-0 on the road, with Vangelis Pavlidis scoring the lone goal. The home team had to play a large portion of the second half with just ten men.Just after halftime, a goal by Pavlidis gave Benfica the victory at the Stade Louis II. In November, Benfica had triumphed 3-2 at Monaco during the league phase.In his team's last five Champions League games, including a hat-trick in the thrilling 5-4 loss to Barcelona last month, the Greek international scored his sixth goal.Moatasem Al-Musrati, a recent Besiktas transfer, was sent off for Monaco in the 52nd minute when he gestured to the referee to request for a yellow card after his teammate Breel Embolo had been fouled. However, he received a second caution himself.Benfica will try to complete the match when they return the following week. The victors will play either Liverpool or Barcelona in the round of 16.Feyenoord defeated seven-time European champions AC Milan 1-0 in Rotterdam on Monday, overcoming the dismissal of coach Brian Priske and gaining the advantage to travel to San Siro for the return.Milan goalie Mike Maignan gave the Dutch a hand with a clanger as Igor Paixao's speculative third-minute shot bounced off his body and into the net.In a game played at De Kuip in pouring rain, that was the lone goal scored.""These evenings are why we do this,"" said Feyenoord captain Quinten Timber.""De Kuip was on it again. We were on it. On to next week,"" he added, with Inter Milan or Arsenal awaiting the winner in the next round.Earlier, a contentious stoppage-time penalty helped Club Brugge defeat Atalanta, the Europa League winners from the previous season, 2-1 in Belgium.Atalanta was penalized for careless play at the back when Ferran Jutgla gave the Belgian team the lead in the fifteenth minute. However, Mario Pasalic headed in an equalizer for the visitors just before halftime.That appeared to be the case until the hosts were given a penalty at the end when Atalanta defender Isak Hien's outstretched arm caught replacement Gustaf Nilsson in the face, causing him to go down.After examining the footage, the referee upheld his assessment that the touch was unintentional and not significant, and Swedish forward Nilsson scored the penalty.""I've only just seen the footage and I reckon that if you ask 100 people if that was a penalty all 100 would say no. It's very strange,"" complained Atalanta's Charles De Ketelaere.The winner of that match will next play either Lille or Aston Villa.","Bayern Munich defeat Celtic 2-1 in Champions League playoff.

Meanwhile, Paris Saint-Germain dominated an all-French match against Brest.Erling Haaland's double versus Madrid, his first goals in five games, appeared to have given Pep Guardiola's team a little lead, but the defending European champions are now heavy favorites to advance to the round of 16 going into next week's return leg in Spain.""It was a weird one. We played some of our best football of the season and ended up behind,"" Bellingham told Amazon Prime.""I don't care what form City are in they are still an unbelievable team. It's always tricky to play against them and we finally took the chance at the end.""City and Madrid have faced off in the competition's knockout round for the fourth straight season; in their last three meetings, the victor has gone on to win the Champions League trophy.After Josko Gvardiol chested down a cross from Jack Grealish, Haaland drove past Thibaut Courtois to give City the lead in the 19th minute, capping off a sluggish start at the Etihad.Haaland was denied a second goal shortly after halftime when his deflected shot bounced against the wall, and Madrid's Vinicius Junior struck the crossbar before City defender Manuel Akanji followed suit with a header.Dani Ceballos clipped the ball back into the area where Mbappe's mishit effort looped into the net after going off his shin and leaving Ederson stranded, giving Madrid the equalizer an hour after the City wall repelled a free-kick.After Ceballos clattered Phil Foden, Haaland tucked away a penalty to give City the lead again ten minutes from the end.However, after a terrible Ederson kick in the 86th minute, former City player Brahim Diaz tied the score for Madrid. Bellingham then punished the home team for more dubious defending when the England midfielder scored the game-winning goal in the dying seconds.""I don't know how to put it into words straight away, it's so raw and frustrating for everyone,"" said City defender John Stones.""It's a feeling of anger and frustration,"" he added. ""We need to see games out better. We need to step up when these bad moments happen.""Ousmane Dembele scored twice for PSG in a 3-0 victory over Brest in France, continuing his incredible goal-scoring run.Following a VAR review for a handball by Pierre Lees-Melou, a midfielder for Brest, Vitinha scored a penalty.Brest came very close to tying the dominant Ligue 1 leaders twice while playing an hour away in Guingamp due to their own stadium's noncompliance with UEFA regulations.While trying to knock the ball behind for a corner, Achraf Hakimi grazed the other upright, and Abdallah Sima hammered a header against the post.After a brilliant team play, Dembele swept past Marco Bizot at his near post to score PSG's second goal just before halftime.Halfway through the second half, the France international scored again with the help of a deflection, giving him 18 goals in his last 11 games.""Ousmane is full of confidence just now. He was good in 2024 and he is even better in 2025,"" said PSG coach Luis Enrique.In the first leg of their match in Turin, Juventus defeated PSV Eindhoven 2-1 at home.In the first half, US international Weston McKennie gave Juventus the lead before Ivan Perisic tied the score for the Netherlands.In the 82nd minute, Samuel Mbangula scored a close-range goal to give Juventus the victory.Borussia Dortmund defeated Sporting Lisbon 3-0 on the road, putting them on the verge of the round of 16.On sixty minutes, Pascal Gross scored a second goal for the runners-up from the previous season, and Serhou Guirassy's soaring header gave the German team the advantage.Following Nuri Sahin's dismissal at the end of January, new coach Niko Kovac secured his first victory with a late third from Karim Adeyemi.",Real Madrid defeat Manchester City 3-2 in Champions League play-off.

NEW DELHI: Liverpool 's quadruple bid for the season came to a stunning end as they suffered a 1-0 defeat against Championship strugglers Plymouth Argyle in the FA Cup on Sunday.Having fielded a weakened side, Liverpool manager Arne Slot saw his decision backfiring, with Ryan Hardie 's second-half penalty sealing Plymouth's epic upset at Home Park.In another high-profile clash, Aston Villa inflicted a 2-1 defeat on Tottenham Hotspur , piling further pressure on manager Ange Postecoglou .Villa took an early lead through Jacob Ramsey's goal, and Morgan Rogers doubled their advantage midway through the second half. Mathys Tel scored a late consolation for Spurs, but it was too little, too late.The 2-1 loss in the fourth round came on the back of an exit from the English League Cup semifinals after a 4-0 second-leg humbling at Liverpool on Thursday.Plymouth's victory over Liverpool is considered one of the greatest giant-killings in FA Cup history.The Argyle, managed by Miron Muslic, a former refugee from war-torn Bosnia, had already beaten Premier League side Brentford in the previous round and secured their first league win since November against West Brom.Slot acknowledged Liverpool's underwhelming performance, stating, ""We were not having a very good day. A result like this is the outcome."" Muslic, on the other hand, expressed his delight, calling it a ""magical day"" for Plymouth.Elsewhere, Wolves cruised into the fifth round with a 2-0 win over Blackburn Rovers, courtesy of goals from Joao Gomes and Matheus Cunha within 39 seconds of each other.The FA Cup exits for Liverpool and Tottenham have ended their hopes of achieving a quadruple and winning silverware this season, respectively. While Liverpool can still focus on the Premier League and Champions League, Spurs' only remaining chance for a trophy lies in the Europa League.","Plymouth Argyle beat Liverpool 1-0 in the fourth round of the FA Cup.

Liverpool suffered a humiliating FA Cup exit as Championship strugglers Plymouth ended their quadruple hopes with a stunning 1-0 victory in the fourth round on Sunday.Arne Slot ’s decision to field a weakened team backfired spectacularly, with Ryan Hardie’s second-half penalty securing Plymouth’s memorable triumph at Home Park.Slot made 10 changes from the side that dominated Tottenham 4-0 in the League Cup semi-final second leg, resting key players like Virgil van Dijk Mohamed Salah , Andrew Robertson, and Cody Gakpo. However, the gamble proved costly, marking a rare misstep in an otherwise stellar debut season for the former Feyenoord boss.Liverpool’s fourth defeat across all competitions this season also represented only the third time they had failed to score under Slot. More significantly, it was just the fourth instance of a Premier League leader being knocked out of the FA Cup by a lower-division club.The Reds must now regroup quickly ahead of the Merseyside derby against Everton at Goodison Park on Wednesday. A victory there would extend their lead over second-placed Arsenal to nine points in the title race. Meanwhile, they remain contenders in the Champions League last 16 and will face Newcastle in the League Cup final in March.Plymouth manager Miron Muslic masterminded one of the FA Cup’s greatest giant-killings while battling to lift his team from the bottom of the Championship. Muslic, a refugee from war-torn Bosnia, moved to Austria at the age of nine after fleeing his besieged hometown of Bihac in 1992.Having already eliminated Premier League side Brentford in the third round, Plymouth entered the match buoyed by their first league victory since November, a 3-2 win over West Brom. Their determined display against Liverpool will go down in FA Cup history.Playing under a wintry sun on the Devon coast, Liverpool’s under-strength squad suffered an early blow when Joe Gomez limped off injured in the first half. The Reds struggled to generate attacking momentum, with Plymouth’s relentless energy frustrating their efforts.James McConnell’s long-range strike in the 36th minute forced a save from Conor Hazard, but Liverpool otherwise lacked cutting edge.The breakthrough came in the 54th minute when Darko Gyabi’s overhead kick struck Harvey Elliott’s raised arm, leading to a clear penalty. Hardie calmly sent Caoimhin Kelleher the wrong way to put Plymouth ahead.Late pressure from Liverpool saw Diogo Jota and Darwin Nunez denied by superb saves from Hazard, as Home Park erupted in celebration at the final whistle.Elsewhere in the FA Cup, Wolves secured a 2-0 win at Blackburn, scoring twice in 39 seconds. Joao Gomes’ shot slipped past Balazs Toth in the 33rd minute, before Matheus Cunha’s blistering strike doubled the lead moments later.Struggling just two points above the Premier League relegation zone, Wolves welcomed the distraction of cup success as they advanced to the fifth round.Meanwhile, Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou faces mounting pressure ahead of their clash against Aston Villa. Having previously claimed he always wins a trophy in his second season, the Australian manager is running out of opportunities to keep that promise if Spurs exit the FA Cup.",Plymouth beat Liverpool 1-0 in the fourth round of the FA Cup.

What did the USTA say about the format?

US Open has revamped the mixed doubles format for the 2025 edition.

What was/is Mixed Madness?

What has been the criticism?

What has the USTA said about the criticism?

The US Open organisers have made a big change to their scheduling and format for the mixed doubles tournament, but not without criticism. Two weeks ago, the USTA (United States Tennis Association) moved the main draw start to a Sunday - following in line with the Australian Open and the French Open - which are 15-day tournaments. The new dates for the fourth and final Slam of the year were confirmed to be August 24 to September 7.The bigger change was announced on Tuesday (February 11) with the mixed doubles tournament set to get a massive change. Not without its share of criticism, though.In a bid to have more singles players enter the mixed doubles competition, the USTA have introduced a bumper $1 million prize money and a revolutionised scoring format.The event size will remain the same as last year - 16 teams or 32 players - but what will change will be the scoring structure and the timelines. The matches are destined to be shorter with the competition to be played over two days.The objective, the tournament organisers say, is to attract the sport's biggest stars, many of whom have long passed on doubles to keep themselves fresh for singles.The scoring is arguably the biggest change introduced. Early round matches will be best-of-three sets played to four games, with a deciding point at deuce. Tiebreakers would be at 4-all—rather than 6-6 — and a 10-point match tiebreaker would be played if the teams split sets, rather than a third set.The final, however, will resemble a Grand Slam match, a best-of-three sets played to six games with no-ad scoring, tiebreakers at 6-all and a 10-point match tiebreaker if there is no winner after two sets.Eight teams will earn direct entry by virtue of their combined singles rankings, with eight other teams given wildcards into the field.All matches will be played on the Arthur Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium courts.As per the plan announced on Tuesday, mixed doubles is set to be contested on August 19 and 20, during the week when the qualifying rounds for men's and women's singles are held at Flushing Meadows. Main draw in singles gets underway on August 24.""What I would say is the reason behind this is to appeal to more fans and grow the fan base around the world,"" said Lew Sherr , executive director and CEO of the USTA. ""But the way to do that is to have the biggest names in the sport participating in doubles, and to showcase them teaming up and playing in a different format, we think is exciting. In fact, we know it's exciting.""Sherr added that USTA had discussed a format change in the past but it never got going until they witnessed the thrill and excitement generated by the "" Mixed Madness .""""We've known and we've had conversations over the years, like, why don't they participate and we understand the scheduling challenges,"" Sherr said.""I think last year's task with that mixed madness event really informed our thinking, that if could unlock that week and free up the top singles players to participate, because it didn't compromise their fitness or their health going into the singles, there was a huge opportunity to attract them and that's what we saw.""The ""Mixed Madness"" was a one-night only, four team competition played last year during the Fan Week which precedes the singles main draw.With prize money of $500,000, the competition featured Naomi Osaka and Nick Kyrgios, Amanda Anisimova and Taylor Fritz, Coco Gauff and Ben Shelton, and Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas.Team Badosa & Tsitsipas took the trophy with a final score of 6-4 against Team Anisimova & Fritz.Paul McNamee, the Australian former doubles World No. 1, was among critics of the shake-up, saying it would devalue the US Open mixed doubles title.""Sets to four games in a Grand Slam? 16 teams with eight based on singles rankings and eight wildcards. I'm sorry, but the US Open now will not produce a bona fide mixed doubles winner,"" McNamee wrote on X, formerly Twitter.""Devalued from a Grand Slam title to an exo (exhibition). Let's just say I'm in shock.""Poland's Jan Zielinski, a winner of the mixed doubles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon last year, described the revamp as ""sad.""""No communication with the players, no thought behind what it means to some people's careers, no respect to the history and traditions,"" Zielinski wrote on X. ""Sad to see.""Last year's US Open mixed doubles winners, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, lambasted the decision in a statement on social media, labeling it a ""profound injustice.""""Making decisions just following the logic of profit is profoundly wrong in some situations,"" the duo wrote.""In the last few weeks we received the news that the US Open mixed doubles tournament will be completely turned upside down, cancelled and replaced with a pseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show.""We see it as a profound injustice that disrespects an entire category of players... we don't know at the moment if we'll have the chance to defend our title but we hope this remains an isolated case.""With the doubles specialists all but out of reckoning for the mixed doubles event, it will reduce the option to earn points and money for them.""Yes, there's some that will be disappointed that they won't have the opportunity to compete in this event,"" Sherr said. ""On the other side, we know that there's a huge opportunity to create more interest globally in doubles and there may be a cascading effect here, that the mixed creates a bigger spotlight on the men's and women's doubles when we get into that portion of the tournament.""We'll have to see how that plays out, but we do know that our mixed competition historically has been competing with the men's and women's singles, and so the fields have suffered and the attention has suffered.

Indian tennis

looks to a 15-year-old now

PUNE: A little over two years ago, Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi lost in straight sets in the quarterfinals of a Grade 3 ITF junior event in Pune. ""I don't lose often. Maybe I will win it next year,"" Maaya, then just 13, had declared. Twelve months later, she did exactly that.Any lingering apprehensions were swept away at last week's Mumbai Open, a WTA 125 event. Unranked a week earlier, the 15-year-old Coimbatore girl now appears on the WTA charts at No. 646, putting her in the top-20 of highest ranking achieved on debut. The list includes Jennifer Capriati, Gabriela Sabatini, Monica Seles and the Williams sisters, among others.The teenager's arrival already spells hope for a beleaguered Indian tennis scene - starved of success, battered by apathy of the officialdom, and a court case against the national body.Imran Mirza, who once famously nurtured a prodigy, is very impressed. ""Her temperament is the most impressive part,"" Mirza, father-coach to Sania, told TOI, ""She seemed very level-headed. That's something one needs to go to the highest level.""We put a lot of pressure in India. With Sania, that was one thing we had to always control, the kind of external pressure there was,"" explained Mirza. ""There's already so much excitement with that one performance. She has a long way to go. We have to make sure she's not pressured into thinking that she's the only (one).""According to Imran, Maaya's parents - father Rajeshwaran who deals in procurement of construction raw materials, and mother Revathi, who co-owns a small business - are best placed to nurture her temperament. ""A child is bothered about what the parents think, not what the whole world thinks. Once the fear of losing comes in, it's very difficult to remove that,"" he said.Maaya's mentality reflects in her aggressive game. Even at 13, she wouldn't hesitate to put away a moonball.Manoj Kumar, coach since she was 10, said, ""We impressed upon her that to compete with the world's best juniors, she needed to be aggressive and at the same time become a bit more consistent.""Kumar underlined that Maaya was yet to complete her junior career. ""She hasn't yet transitioned into the women's circuit. She has done well in one tournament, she needs to do it regularly,"" he said.Transition to the pros has always proved the biggest hurdle in Indian tennis. Maaya seems to come well prepared. A little over five-feet-seven in her shoes, she has a good couple of more years to grow, putting on four kgs of muscle mass over the past year. ""I eat like a beast,"" she said recently.With the Rafa Nadal Academy offering her a one-year scholarship, the Indian is in a group of four players who are monitored by two head coaches and assistants. Last month, Miguel Fragoso accompanied her for junior events in India, but she can also summon the familiarity of Kumar in her corner.While the teenager will continue with schooling in Spain, Imran cautioned against too much tinkering with technique. ""In Europe, most of the training is more suited to the clay-court game,"" he said, ""There can be exceptions, (but) we seem to be more suited to hard courts because we have more skill in our hands, and in our joints than in the feet.""","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi, 15, is ranked No. 646 in the WTA rankings.

Jannik Sinner’s success has a lot to do with coach Cahill: Amritraj,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jannik-sinners-success-has-a-lot-to-do-with-coach-cahill-amritraj/articleshow/118122407.cms,"Vijay Amritraj

CHENNAI: Italy’s Jannik Sinner appears to be by far the most in-form men’s tennis player on the world circuit. Despite facing doping allegations, the world No. 1 did not let that affect him as he asserted his authority by winning the US Open and Australian Open.Indian legend Vijay Amritraj credited coach Darren Cahill for Sinner’s success. “The one major factor in Sinner’s game has been Cahill. I always knew that Darren had a very strong mental approach, and his ability to impart that to you and help you reach a point where you believe in yourself, where there is no second place for me – only first – has been crucial. And when I see Sinner play, I see a lot of that in him,” Vijay, who introduced Cahill to television, said on the sidelines of the Chennai Open Challenger. Novak Djokovic ’s decision to join forces with coach Andy Murray took Vijay by surprise. Djokovic and his former rival Murray began their partnership at the Australian Open, and the 37-year-old had a decent start to the season, reaching the semifinals.“I am surprised by Andy’s decision because he has just finished his tennis career, and to jump into something like this... you know, he has a family and would probably want to stay home. But he loves the game so much. I think they are a good match, and Andy can rejuvenate Djokovic to perform better.“Also, Djokovic’s match against (Carlos) Alcaraz was unbelievable – one of the best matches we have seen in a long time. Alcaraz is marginally more inconsistent mentally. He has more to offer in terms of his game,” Vijay added.The former Davis Cup finalist was vocal about the US Open’s move to add an extra day to the competition. He also stressed that the ATP reducing the number of 250-level Tour events is not a good sign. “By adding a day, they have killed the ATP 250 tournament the week before. The Slams are very important but let us not forget that you need tournaments in every part of the world. To become a Djokovic, (Roger) Federer, or (Rafael) Nadal, you still need other players to beat, right? These five or six guys alone cannot go and play the Grand Slams. You need another 100 players in the draw. So, I do not understand why they do not allow others to host tournaments.”'Trying to bring a big tournament to India'India lost its right to host an ATP 250 event a few years ago. In 2022, the country hosted a WTA 250 Tour event, but it has not been a permanent fixture on the calendar. Vijay has been pushing to host a top-level event in India but to no avail. “If you want to be a global sport, you need to have an event in India. When I was playing in the 70s and 80s, we had tournaments across all capitals in Asia. And you are saying none of this is possible? I am being very vocal with these guys about doing this,” said Vijay, who is the president of the Tamil Nadu Tennis Association (TNTA).",Vijay Amritraj credits coach Darren Cahill for Italy's Jannik Sinner's success.

Chennai: Soon after winning the Chennai Open Challenger men’s singles title on Sunday, Kyrian Jacquet humbly stated that he had not played his best tennis over the week. However, during the Frenchman’s journey to the crown, he defeated two seeded players and dropped just a single set.The 23-year-old Jacquet’s level was enough to comfortably beat Elias Ymer of Sweden 7-6(1), 6-4 in the final, a result that handed him the coveted title and 100 ranking points.At the SDAT Stadium , Jacquet made an early breakthrough, taking a 4-2 lead in the opening set. However, Ymer refused to back down, breaking Jacquet’s serve in the eighth game and pushing the set into a tie-breaker. But the tie-breaker was a one-sided affair, with the Swede making six unforced errors and leaving Jacquet with little to do.In the second set, Ymer’s unforced errors continued to give Jacquet an advantage and soon, the former was trailing 1-4. Though Ymer fought back, winning three games in a row, he faltered in the end. Inconsistency crept in, and errors began to pile up. Jacquet, maintaining his composure, comfortably cruised to victory with a double fault from Ymer sealing the win.Jacquet operated with the strategy of using his slices effectively, taking pace off the ball. By doing so, he disrupted Ymer’s rhythm, forcing him to generate more pace on his shots. “I played a lot of slices during all the matches because I like to play slices to change the rhythm. I try to destabilise the opponent. So yeah, I did well today (Sunday),” Jacquet said.Jacquet had previously mentioned that he believes his tennis is better than what his current ranking reflects. Last year, a string of injuries forced him to be sidelined for eight months, which led to a drop in his ranking. His performance in Chennai showed that he is on the comeback trail, proving his potential. “I play better than my rank, that is for sure. It was very tough last year, and I did all the work that I could to be ready to come here. I am really happy about the week because I was feeling better and better as the days went by. If I continue to play like this, I will go up faster (in the rankings).”Jacquet will jump above 60 places and get close to the top-200 mark in the ATP singles chart.","Kyrian Jacquet beat Elias Ymer of Sweden 7-6(1), 6-4 in the final.

MUMBAI: Going into Sunday's L&T Mumbai Open final, fifth seed Jil Teichmann was not aware if a win would send her back into the top 100 of the WTA Rankings .After a convincing 6-3, 6-4 win over Thailand's Mananchaya Sawangkaew at the Cricket Club of India , she knew.""My coach didn't tell me either,"" Teichmann said with a wide grin after picking up her second WTA 125k title in the last five months. ""For me it was definitely a goal to win this trophy. I am smart, so I kind of did the maths but I didn't know if it's going to be top 100 or not. The next little goal I had was to crack the top 100 again and to keep going.""Ranked 117 at the start of the week, Sunday's triumph launched the 27-year-old Swiss to 100th spot in the live rankings.The manner in which she played, not just on Sunday, but for most of this week, was a reminder, though, of why she was just outside the top 20 less than three years ago.Sawangkaew, the World No. 121, cracked under pressure from Teichmann's variety and precision in her groundstrokes, going down a double break in the first set. Even though she was able to get one back, the lead was too much as the fifth seed took the opening set.The Thai's forehand often let her down in the 1 hour, 37 minute encounter, and three errors in succession gave Teichmann an early break in set two. Though the eighth seed was able to break back immediately, the inconsistency in her game proved detrimental to her chances, as the Swiss grabbed the advantage once again.Sawangkaew did manage to draw level in the sixth game, but Teichmann banked on her lethal forehand, producing two timely winners to earn the decisive break in the seventh game.Her booming serve down the T has been another formidable weapon this week, and she landed one perfectly to bring up three match points. Sawangkaew saved the first but a deft backhand volley from Teichmann was a fitting way for the Swiss to complete the win, and take home $15,500.In the doubles final, Prarthana Thombare and Arianne Hartono endured heartbreak for the second year in a row, as the Indian-Dutch pairing went down 7-6(4), 2-6, 10-7 to the all-Russian combination of Amina Anshba and Elena Pridankina.","Jil Teichmann beats Mananchaya Sawangkaew 6-3, 6-4 in the L&T Mumbai Open final.

Carlos Alcaraz claimed his first indoor title at the Rotterdam Open on Sunday, defeating Australia’s Alex de Minaur 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 in a hard-fought final.The world No. 3 showcased his firepower from both wings, overpowering De Minaur, who defended admirably but lacked the finishing weapons to trouble the top seed.Alcaraz struck first, breaking in the third game with a mix of heavy groundstrokes and a costly double fault from De Minaur. The Australian, ranked No. 8, responded with a love break in the seventh game, leveling the set at 4-4.However, an ill-advised drop shot at 0-30 gifted Alcaraz another chance, and a powerful backhand pass set up the opportunity to serve out the set. The Spaniard capitalized, closing it out as De Minaur netted a forehand return.Momentum shifted in the second set, with De Minaur breaking early and surging to a 3-0 lead. He missed two chances for a double break but held on to even the match at one set apiece, sealing it as Alcaraz faltered with errant groundstrokes.The decider remained on serve until the sixth game when Alcaraz broke with a deft drop shot that De Minaur pushed wide.

MUMBAI: Getting to the semifinals of the L&T Mumbai Open was already a massive success for Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi , particularly considering the 15-year-old hadn’t originally planned to play the WTA125K event.On Saturday, Jil Teichmann , an opponent currently ranked 117 in the world, and as high as 21 less than three years ago, proved a hurdle too steep for the promising teenager from Coimbatore. The fifth seed from Switzerland needed only 68 minutes to seal her spot in Sunday’s final, winning 6-3,6-1 to end Maaya’s remarkable run at the Cricket Club of India here.Teichmann will battle the eighth seed Mananchaya Sawangkaew for the title, after the 22-year-old Thai stunned second seed Rebecca Marino 6-2, 6-2 in the first semifinal.As much as it’s been a special eight days for Maaya, who was given a wild card to the qualifiers by the tournament officials, it’s also been physically demanding. On Friday, she needed to go to a deciding set for the third time in the week to beat Japan’s Mei Yamaguchi in the quarterfinals. And she would admit to feeling the cumulative toll on her legs, as Teichmann seized control of the match from the start.The 27-year-old Swiss, with two WTA titles to her name, successfully managed to neutralise Maaya from the baseline with her powerful groundstrokes to break the y oung Indian twice for a 4-0 lead. Then, a loose game on serve which came out of nowhere sparked Maaya’s best spell of the match. The home girl was suddenly swinging freely and delighted the near full-house with three roaring winners to hold serve for the first time. She knocked on the door again in the next game, earning two break points, which the experienced Teichmann did well to stave off and extend her lead.Having negotiated the teenager’s best spell, Teichmann was barely troubled from there on.The challenge of taking on a quality lefthander, something Maaya had been wary about following her-quarterfinal win on Friday, had proven to be a daunting experience after all.“It (playing a lefty) was worse than I expected,” Maaya would chuckle later. “Also, I did play a very experienced player and I felt that I didn’t play the way I hoped I would. Also I was physically a bit tired.”There were still “a lot of positives” gained from a week which saw Maaya come into the tournament unranked and finish with 55 ranking points. When the latest WTA rankings come out on Monday, Maaya will be in 645th spot.","Jil Teichmann beats Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi 6-3,6-1 in the semifinals of the L&T Mumbai Open.

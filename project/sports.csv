NEW DELHI: In a thrilling IPL encounter, Shardul Thakur 's impressive four-wicket haul and Nicholas Pooran 's sensational display of power-hitting guided Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG ) to a five-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) on Thursday.Thakur's dream comeback continued as he returned with figures of 4/34, helping LSG restrict the formidable SRH batting lineup to 190/9.Pooran then took center stage, showcasing his 360-degree hitting prowess with a blistering 70 off just 26 deliveries, including six fours and six maximums. His partnership with Mitchell Marsh (52 off 31) yielded a match-winning 116 runs for the second wicket, propelling LSG to chase down the target in just 16.1 overs.Despite losing Aiden Markram early in their chase, LSG surged ahead thanks to the effortless hitting from Marsh and Pooran. Pooran, in particular, was at his attacking best, dealing primarily in sixes and clobbering Simarjeet and Abhishek Sharma for massive hits, mostly towards the square boundary.SRH found it challenging to contain Pooran as he didn't even spare Cummins, hitting him for two fours in his first over to reach 77/1 in the powerplay. Pooran brought up the fastest fifty of the season in just 18 balls with another colossal six over square leg off Adam Zampa's bowling.Cummins eventually trapped Pooran in front of the wickets in the ninth over, but Marsh took the onus upon himself and brought up his half-century off just 29 balls. Although LSG skipper Rishabh Pant (15 off 15) couldn't contribute much, Abdul Samad played an entertaining cameo to guide his side home.Earlier, after opting to bowl first, Shardul (4/34) provided LSG with a fiery start, removing Abishek Sharma and the previous match's centurion, Ishan Kishan, in consecutive balls in the third over. While Shardul sent Sharma packing with a short delivery, he dismissed Kishan caught behind off an innocuous delivery down the leg side.Travis Head (47 off 28), however, looked in ominous form as he took the attack to the opposition, using his brute power to deal in boundaries and sixes. Head was particularly brutal against Avesh Khan, hitting him for two sixes and one four to pick up 18 runs in the fourth over.Head was fortunate to receive two reprieves, but his luck eventually ran out when fast bowler Prince Yadav disturbed his timbers to claim his first IPL wicket.Henrich Klaasen (26 off 17) was run out in a bizarre fashion by Yadav off his own bowling, while young Aniket Verma played a 13-ball 36-run cameo that included five sixes before falling to leg-spinner Disvesh Rathi.SRH skipper Pat Cummins (18 off 4) hit three sixes off his first three balls before departing in style, contributing to SRH's competitive total of 190/9.",Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG) beat Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) by five wickets.

HYDERABAD: The talk ahead of the Sunrisers Hyderabad ’s (SRH) clash against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) was about whether the hosts would scale Mount 300. The odds were stocked heavily against the visitors with their bowling unit in disarray. But when Rishabh Pant chose to bowl, it looked like he had plans in place for the hosts’ dangerous batting order. And his bowlers justified him.After being ignored at the death by captain Pant in his side’s one-wicket loss to Delhi Capitals in Visakhapatnam, 'Player of the Match' Shardul Thakur returned impressive figures of 4/34 to restrict Sunrisers Hyderabad to 190/9.The diminutive Nicholas Pooran then took charge. He showcased his big-hitting prowess with a 26-ball 70 (6x4, 6x6). He added 116 runs with Mitchell Marsh (52; 31b; 7x4, 2x6) that eventually sealed a five-wicket victory for LSG with 23 deliveries to spare.Though the visitors lost Aiden Markram (1) in Mohammed Shami’s first over, Pooran went berserk. He smashed Simarjeet Singh and Abhishek Sharma for two sixes, plundering 17 and 18 runs each. Marsh was not far behind as he smashed Shami for two sixes and the visitors raced to 77/1 in the first six overs.Pooran then hit Zampa for 19 runs with two sixes and a boundary in the seventh over to complete his halfcentury in 18 deliveries. The LSG No. 3 contributed 70 runs to the second-wicket partnership before he was trapped in front by Pat Cummins in the 9th over.Marsh reached his fifty in 29 balls (7x4, 2x6) but holed out to long-on off Cummins in the 11th over. But by then, the duo had reduced the target to 53 from 54 balls.Abdul Samad 22* (8b; 2x4, 2x6) and David Miller (13*) finished the game that was set up by the LSG bowlers.Thakur struck in his second over, dismissing Abhishek (6) and last-match centurion Kishan (0) off successive deliveries. Travis Head (47; 28b, 5x4, 3x6) hit the first six of the night in the fourth over off Avesh Khan and another over extra cover and a boundary for 18 runs as Avesh looked rusty in his first match since January.Head got two reprieves in Ravi Bishnoi’s first over. Pooran dropped a sitter at long-on with Head on 35. Two balls later, Bishnoi grassed a tough caught and bowled chance.","Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) beat Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) by five wickets.

GUWAHATI: With the current Indian Premier League (IPL) season witness to some high-scoring games in the opening week, Wednesday’s match at the ACA Stadium then looked like an aberration.The Barsapara track offered help for the tweakers as Kolkata Knight Riders spinners, Varun Chakravarthy and Moeen Ali , ran through hosts Rajasthan Royals’ middle order to choke the flow of runs to restrict them to 151.On the wicket, Ali said, “It was good one, had a bit of everything — swing, bit of seam, spun nicely but not massively, just enough spin. I played here in the England warmup games (ahead of 2023 ODI World Cup); it’s a very nice ground.”Ali added that it was good that the track offered something for the bowlers.“Some of the wickets are amazing. India is a great place to bat actually, and when the wickets are like this, you’re not going to get 300, you probably won’t even get 200. So it’s great to have these games in between those big ones,” said Ali.Ali combined well with Chakravarthy as the duo shared four wickets between them. The English allrounder had praise for his ‘mystery’ partner Chakravarthy.“I came on before him (seventh over), so my job was to bowl tight. I’m used to bowling with somebody who’s better and has more mystery. So I bowl as tight as I can and hopefully, that builds pressure for them to get wickets,” Ali said.“Varun’s a brilliant bowler who has improved so much over the last two-three years. It’s amazing to bowl with him.”",Kolkata Knight Riders restrict Rajasthan Royals to 151. Moeen Ali and Varun Chakravarthy take four wickets between them.

After serving a one-match suspension for an over-rate offence from Mumbai Indians ' (MI) concluding match of the 2024 Indian Premier League season, Hardik Pandya will be back to lead the five-time champions in their second match of this edition against Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Saturday.Both MI and the 2022 champions Gujarat had lost their opening fixtures against Chennai Super Kings and Punjab Kings, respectively and are keen to put a win on the board for their first points.The MI squad utilised the extended break between their first and second matches by spending time at the Reliance facility in Jamnagar, where they participated in team-building exercises and relaxation activities.While the return of captain and all-rounder Hardik will come as a boost for MI, they will remain without the services of their premier fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah, who continues to recuperate from his back injury at the BCCI's Centre of Excellence on Bengaluru.Hardik's return to the playing eleven likely means Robin Minz's exclusion, although MI's batting performance on the tricky Chepauk pitch failed to generate confidence.The batting conditions in Ahmedabad on Saturday evening will prove more favourable, considering the substantial 475 runs scored in 40 overs during the first match of the season at the venue between Punjab Kings (243) and hosts Gujarat (232).But the batting-friendly surface at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad raises concerns about Mohammed Siraj's effectiveness, following his expensive spell of 54 runs in the previous match where Punjab batters dominated his bowling.With not many senior Indian pacers in the GT ranks, it will be a strategic call that home team head coach Ashish Nehra will fret upon. The pressure to contain runs as well as take wickets is way too much on Kagiso Rabada and Rashid Khan.Both the teams clearly had difficulties in finding the optimal blend of their overseas players.For MI, the challenges are further intensified due to Suryakumar Yadav's prolonged dip in performance over the past year, while Rohit Sharma also needs to rediscover his consistency.The addition of Pandya strengthens the batting lineup while offering bowling options, particularly at the start of the innings. His expertise in delivering wide yorkers during death overs.The Gujarat Titans' overall performance this season could heavily depend on captain Shubman Gill's batting form.The bowling department presents concerns for captain Gill, as the Indian pacers - Siraj, Prasidh Krishna and Ishant Sharma - predominantly employ similar hit-the-deck techniques. Apart from Rabada, the pace attack lacks variety in their bowling arsenal.","Hardik Pandya will lead Mumbai Indians against Gujarat Titans on Saturday.

Under the leadership of Ruturaj Gaikwad, the Chennai Super Kings will face off against Rajat Patidar’s Royal Challengers Bengaluru in their Indian Premier League 2025 match today (March 28) at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai.Both teams are entering this encounter on the back of confident victories: RCB secured a seven-wicket win against the Kolkata Knight Riders in their season opener at Eden Gardens, while CSK triumphed over their long-time rivals, the Mumbai Indians, by four wickets.After a heated previous season, the rivalry between these franchises has intensified, promising a thrilling matchup.Chennai has continued to offer the slowest conditions of all venues in the IPL. There's something that comes to the fore for both batters and bowlers, especially the spinners.In the last match at this venue, Mumbai Indians were stuck on a slow surface and Chennai Super Kings were able to control the flow of the game courtesy their experienced spin attack of Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin and young Afghan sensation Noor Ahmad.While RCB bring in Krunal Pandya and Suyash Sharma, who can make a mark as well, CSK’s bowling against the RCB batting, especially the top order, could be decisive.CSK: Ruturaj Gaikwad(c), Rachin Ravindra, Deepak Hooda, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Sam Curran, MS Dhoni(wk), Ravichandran Ashwin, Noor Ahmad, Nathan Ellis, Khaleel AhmedImpact Sub: Rahul Tripathi, Kamlesh NagarkotiRCB: Virat Kohli, Philip Salt, Rajat Patidar (c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Rasikh Dar, Suyash Sharma, Josh Hazlewood, Bhuvneshwar KumarImpact Sub: Devdutt Padikkal/Yash DayalChennai Super Kings squad : Ruturaj Gaikwad (c), MS Dhoni, Ravindra Jadeja, Shivam Dube, Matheesha Pathirana, Noor Ahmad, Ravichandran Ashwin, Devon Conway, Syed Khaleel Ahmed, Rachin Ravindra, Rahul Tripathi, Vijay Shankar, Sam Curran, Shaik Rashid, Anshul Kamboj, Mukesh Choudhary, Deepak Hooda, Gurjanpreet Singh, Nathan Ellis, Jamie Overton, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Ramakrishnan Ghosh, Shreyas Gopal, Vansh Bedi, Andre Siddarth.Royal Challengers Bengaluru squad : Rajat Patidar (c), Virat Kohli, Yash Dayal, Josh Hazlewood, Phil Salt, Jitesh Sharma, Liam Livingstone, Rasikh Salam, Suyash Sharma, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Swapnil Singh, Tim David, Romario Shepherd, Nuwan Thushara, Manoj Bhandage, Jacob Bethel, Devdutt Padikkal, Swastik Chhikara, Lungi Ngidi, Abhinandan Singh, Mohit Rathee.Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challengers Bengaluru have played 33 matches against each other in the IPL.

CSK in IPL 2025: Sixth title loading for Chennai Super Kings?

Chennai: There’s a new ‘No. 9’ in town. MS Dhoni has made a career out of being out of the box, but on Friday night at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, he seemed to be stretching things a bit too far.As wickets fell and CSK kept losing steam in their chase of 197, the fans got more and more impatient. They wanted to see their ‘Thala’ come out and take on the RCB bowlers, but the wait continued. It was only after Ravichandran Ashwin, not exactly a swashbuckler, got out in the 16th over that Dhoni walked in at No. 9, probably the lowest that he has batted in his 18-year IPL career.Not that he batted badly. The 16-ball 30* was an indicator that his ability to clear the boundary hasn’t exactly diminished. In fact, it was his late burst of 19 off Krunal Pandya that brought down the margin of defeat to 50. But then, what’s holding him back? Dhoni is apparently “fitter than what he was in the last two years,” when he was playing with a knee injury and a muscle tear, respectively. His wicketkeeping skills are only getting better — the stumping of Phil Salt on Friday was a piece of beauty — but there’s a strange reluctance to go up the order with the bat.Virender Sehwag was quite critical about his decision to bat No. 9. “What can you do? Even when he was playing for India, he didn’t care much for suggestions to go up the order. Now, it’s probably the fag end of his career, what can you expect?” Sehwag said in a post-match show.The CSK think-tank, though, has a different take on the issue. Captain Ruturaj Gaikwad was asked before the first game against Mumbai Indians if there will be a case for a promotion in the batting order for Dhoni. “MSD has been performing a specific role and he is doing that very well. It’s unlikely to change,” he said.What he meant was that Dhoni is still immensely dangerous at the business end of the innings, where his ability to clear the fence and the fear factor that he generates combine beautifully to bolster the CSK totals. Last year, in those short bursts, Dhoni was batting at a strike-rate of 220.54, and the CSK team wants that same impact this time too.Even though the legend has maintained his body well, there’s always that gnawing suspicion that too much running between the wickets may just lead to damage of the ageing body that has taken a lot of wear and tear. The IPL is a two-month journey, and the team wants him fully fit when things really get tight at the back-end.Don’t be surprised if CSK are only three down in the 15th over against Rajasthan Royals in Guwahati on Sunday and Dhoni comes out to bat. “Dhoni has done a good pre-season, working on his hitting and keeping skills,” coach Stephen Fleming said.",MS Dhoni came down to bat at No. 9 during Chennai Super Kings' loss against Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Chennai. It was probably the lowest that he has batted in his 18-year IPL career. The 16-ball 30* was an indicator that his ability to clear the boundary hasn’t exactly diminished.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119738783,imgsize-64574,width-400,resizemode-4/119738783.jpg"

Bombay Sports Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

Former India players Manoj Tiwary and Virender Sehwag have raised concerns about Mumbai Indians' Rohit Sharma 's recent performance following another single-digit score. Mumbai Indians faced a 36-run defeat against Gujarat Titans, marking their second consecutive loss in IPL 2025.Rohit Sharma's IPL journey has been challenging lately. He was dismissed for a duck by Khaleel Ahmed in the opening match against CSK.Against Gujarat Titans, Rohit managed to hit two boundaries in the first three balls. However, Mohammed Siraj's precise delivery that swung back in dismissed him shortly after.In the past five IPL seasons, Rohit has crossed the 400-run mark only once. The Mumbaikar has had six single-digit scores in last nine IPL innings.Tiwary expressed concern about Rohit's inability to consistently achieve 600-700 runs per season.The situation is particularly notable following last year's controversial captaincy change. Hardik Pandya's appointment as captain in place of Rohit Sharma led to widespread fan disapproval, with crowds booing Pandya at various venues.""Look, I'm telling you, I don't want to be tough, but I must be. For some players, you have to be. Look, it's high time Rohit Sharma got back among the runs. The ability of a player like Rohit Sharma is not 400. Last season, he scored 400, he hit a century, that's fine. But where is the 800-900 season? Rohit is just not able to have these types of seasons. Why does Virat Kohli always score? You tell me. It's equally good. It's equally good, but there should be a season where Rohit scores 600-700,"" Manoj Tiwary told Cricbuzz.""He should take his orange cap with him. That's how it should be. How will it be if you don't get a good start? I expect a lot from him. That's why he was retained. Because of last year's drama and controversy, it felt like Rohit would leave because there were a lot of small audio clips. Despite that, he was retained. But since there were no runs in the last two matches, the atmosphere must have been mixed up,"" he added.Former India opener Sehwag also shared his thoughts on Rohit's performance. While acknowledging his admiration for Rohit, Sehwag suggested it might be too late to expect a 600-700 run season from him.""What Manoj Tiwary said about Rohit Sharma, where is that season? Isn't it too late for this type of season to come (laughs)? We are also his fans, but we are just asking where the season of 600-700 runs is. When has Rohit Sharma done that? It has been 18 years, when it has not happened in 18 years, how can you hope for this to happen now when he is at the last part of his career?"" asked Sehwag.Following their loss to Gujarat Titans, Mumbai Indians now stand at ninth position in the points table. Their next match is scheduled against the defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday.","Rohit Sharma has had six single-digit scores in last nine IPL innings.

Gujarat Titans head coach Ashish Nehra displayed visible frustration during Saturday's IPL 2025 match against Mumbai Indians at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. His reaction came after Gujarat lost five wickets in the final 13 balls, finishing at 196 for eight, though they eventually won by 36 runs.Gujarat's innings started promisingly with opener Sai Sudharsan scoring a powerful 63 runs off 41 balls. The team was well-positioned at 170 for three after 17 overs.Mumbai Indians' effective death-over bowling led to a dramatic collapse for Gujarat. They lost three wickets in just three balls, moving from 179 for four to 179 for six between the 17.5 and 18.2 overs, with Sherfane Rutherford's dismissal by Deepak Chahar particularly triggering Nehra's outburst.This marked Gujarat's second batting collapse in IPL 2025. Their previous collapse occurred against Punjab Kings during a 244-run chase, where they went from 169 for two in the 14th over to 232 for five by the 20th over.Sudharshan's performance marked his second consecutive fifty in the league, following his 74 against Punjab. The Gujarat fast bowlers then secured the team's first IPL 2025 victory.Mohammad Siraj made early inroads by dismissing both openers, Rohit Sharma and Ryan Rickelton, during the powerplay. Prasidh Krishna played a crucial role by taking the wickets of Suryakumar Yadav (48) and Tilak Varma (39), effectively stopping Mumbai's comeback attempt.The victory gave Gujarat their first points of the season, following their previous high-scoring loss to Punjab by 11 runs. For Mumbai Indians, this resulted in their second consecutive defeat, coming after their four-wicket loss to Chennai Kings the previous Sunday.",Gujarat lost five wickets in the final 13 balls to lose by 36 runs.

Siraj led the attack, removing both Mumbai openers early on, while Krishna's 2-18, which included a key wicket in the middle order, further crippled Mumbai's chase.Mumbai's former captain Rohit Sharma began aggressively with two boundaries but was bowled by Siraj for eight. Siraj then dismissed South African Ryan Rickelton for six, clean bowling him. Despite a 62-run stand between Tilak Varma and Suryakumar Yadav, Krishna struck again to dismiss Varma for 39.Suryakumar fought hard with 48 runs, including four sixes, but as the required run rate climbed, Krishna struck again, removing him. Hardik Pandya , who scored just 11, was dismissed by Kagiso Rabada, ending Mumbai's chances of a successful chase.Earlier, Gujarat's openers Sudharsan and Shubman Gill started cautiously before breaking free with 35 runs between overs five and six.

Pandya contributed with the ball, taking 2-29.Sudharsan continued to anchor the innings, sharing partnerships with Jos Buttler , who hit 39 off 24 balls before being dismissed by Mujeeb Ur Rahman.

CHENNAI: For years, Royal Challengers Bengaluru ’s captaincy baton has passed through the hands of stalwarts – Kevin Pietersen, Anil Kumble, Daniel Vettori, Virat Kohli, and Faf du Plessis – yet none could crack the code against Chennai Super Kings in Chennai.Then came Rajat Patidar – not the most decorated name – who in his very first stint as captain did what the giants before him couldn’t: lead RCB to a historic win at Chepauk after 17 long years on Friday. In a format where the game moves at breakneck speed, leadership decisions could be overshadowed by individual brilliance. But some of these decisions quietly decide matches.RCB opener Phil Salt was quick to acknowledge his skipper’s impact, praising how Patidar kept the visitors on the front foot throughout the game.“Brilliant captaincy. He is brilliant in all areas. To take the initiative with the new ball is one thing, but to not take the foot of the gas and drive it home…and you know there was not one period of the game when we let the pressure off the opposition, so you have to tip your hat off to the bowlers and Rajat for doing that,” Salt said after the match.Be it leading from the front with a fluent knock of 51 (off 32 balls; 4x4, 3x6) in the trickiest phase of the innings against CSK’s lethal spinners, or his bowling changes that broke budding partnerships in the middle overs, or his precise field placements – Patidar orchestrated them all seamlessly.During his innings, he took on the young, crafty chinaman Noor Ahmad with a towering six and punished the seasoned Ravindra Jadeja with two fours and a six. Speaking about it, the 31-year-old from Indore said: “I think it was a very important innings from me because we were targeting 200, as that wouldn’t be easy to chase. My goal was clear that as long as I was there, I would maximise every ball.”Salt was in awe of his captain and was all praise for the way he dealt with the spinners. “I’ve not seen anybody hit spin the way he can. And then you come to his captaincy, and he’s a cool head and very calm under pressure. He’s got a very good cricketing brain. And the way that he spun the bowlers around tonight (Friday) to make sure that we’re keeping the pressure on at all times. There’s a reason he’s got the Player of the Match trophy as well,” said Salt.",Rajat Patidar captained Royal Challengers Bengaluru to historic win over Chennai Super Kings on Friday.

Sethu FC’s Ugandan star Amnah Nababi uses IWL earnings for charity back home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/sethu-fcs-ugandan-star-amnah-nababi-uses-iwl-earnings-for-charity-back-home/articleshow/119707164.cms,"Amnah Nababi (in blue)

CHENNAI: In an otherwise disappointing Indian Women’s League (IWL) campaign for Sethu FC, Amnah Nababi has been one of the few shining lights.But it is not just the on-field performances – she is Sethu’s best performer with six goals and one assist in 10 appearances – that have made her stand out in her maiden IWL season. The Uganda international, in her constant fight against poverty back home, is using football as a powerful tool to perform social work and give back to her community.The 26-year-old Amnah is allotting 20% of her IWL salary to “support” underprivileged children in her home district Luweero, situated about 70 kilometres from Kampala, where she is currently based. “Poverty is one thing that we are struggling with in Uganda. There are a lot of kids who do not have enough food at home, they do not have enough money to pay school fees. Their background is not really good. I pursued my education through scholarships, so I feel that I should go out there and support the kids from the money I receive through football,” said Amnah, who netted a brace in Sethu’s 3-1 victory over Odisha FC on Thursday.“Whenever I get an opportunity, I share the money with them. Obviously, I have been using my Sethu salary for the cause. One of the things I am planning to do after the IWL season is to go back home and give them more,” she added.Amnah, a capable operator in both attack and midfield, took the noble initiative a few years ago and now leads her “team” comprising about 30 children.“I started doing this during Covid. I had to do personal training (in Luweero) and the kids would come and play football with me. I used to play with them because I was free. After that, I became busy with football and work (she worked at an NGO). I have a small team, I cannot call it an academy because it is not registered. The kids stay around my home in Luweero and they get together after school in the evenings. I try to support them with small things.”Amnah relies on her friends when she is on duty away from home. “There are people who take care of the kids. Some of the kids who are now 15 or 16 years old take care of the younger ones. I have a lot of things to do when I go back home, many people are waiting for me. I hope to go there (Luweero) and spend time with the children,” Amnah said.Amnah, with a heart of gold and plenty of footballing tricks up her sleeve, is “setting an example” both on and off the field.","Amnah Nababi is Sethu FC's best performer in the Indian Women's League.

The Confederation of Brazilian Football (CBF) announced on Friday the dismissal of Dorival Junior from his position as Brazil 's head coach in the aftermath of Brazil's devastating 4-1 loss to their fierce rivals Argentina in the FIFA World Cup qualifying match three days earlier.The five-time World Cup champions Brazil currently occupy fourth position in the South American qualifying standings, trailing Argentina, the reigning world champions, by 10 points and also behind Ecuador and Uruguay. Argentina secured their qualification for the World Cup by beating Brazil.South American teams have six automatic qualification spots available for the World Cup.""Dorival Junior is no longer in charge of the Brazilian national team. The management thanks him and wishes him success for the rest of his career,"" the CBF said in a statement.Dorival, aged 62, took over the managerial role in January 2024, replacing interim coach Fernando Diniz. However, his tenure has been marked by underwhelming performances in the 2026 World Cup qualifying matches for the tournament to be held across the United States, Mexico and Canada.Brazil's upcoming qualifying fixtures include an away match against Ecuador and a home game against Paraguay, scheduled for June 4 and June 9, respectively.""Nobody expected what we saw today (against Argentina), and the responsibility is entirely mine,"" the Brazil coach had said after the crushing defeat.Dorival assumed leadership of the Selecao following his successful tenure securing championships with Flamengo and Sao Paulo.Brazilian press reports suggest that Ancelotti remains a candidate to replace Dorival, alongside Portuguese tactician Jorge Jesus, who presently manages Al Hilal in Saudi Arabia.Another Portuguese coach, Abel Ferreira, who achieved multiple championships with Brazilian side Palmeiras, is also considered a potential candidate for the position.Ancelotti, however, is confident of completing the term of his contract in Madrid which runs until June 2026.The incoming manager's primary responsibility will be to revive Brazil's distinctive playing approach and secure their first championship since claiming the Copa America in 2019.","Dorival Junior has been dismissed from his position as Brazil's head coach.

PANAJI: Given the state of football in the country, India may be still years away from making it to the World Cup but next year, when sport’s greatest spectacle kicks off in North America, we will have something to call our own and cheer for at home.Despite rivalry in cricket, many Indians could actually be rooting for New Zealand at the 2026 tournament to be played across Mexico, Cananda and the US. The reason? Sarpreet Singh , the All Whites’ midfielder who has his roots in Punjab.Born in Auckland to Indian parents who migrated from Punjab, Sarpreet will become only the second Indian-origin player after France midfielder Vikash Dhorasoo (2006), to play at the marquee FIFA event in its nearly 100-year history.“I grew up in a Punjabi household, an Indian background, and for me that’s a huge feeling of pride,” Sarpreet, a regular in NZ’s midfield, told TOI over telephone from Portugal, where he plays for Uniao de Leiria.The first player of Indian descent to play in the German Bundesliga, when he was signed by six-time European champions Bayern Munich in 2019, today Sarpreet is aware of the hope he carries for the nation of his origin, who fervently desire to be counted among football’s elite.“I will do my best because I know I represent a lot of people. I want to try and create a pathway for future Indian players; I hope it can lead for future players to go through and do their thing,” he said.New Zealand qualified for the World Cup -- for the first time since 2010 and for the only the third time in the event’s history -- following a hard-fought 3-0 victory over New Caledonia in the Oceania qualifiers. They join Japan, Iran, Argentina and the three hosts to be among the first to make the 48-team global extravaganza next year.“Sarpreet Singh at the World Cup isn’t just a personal triumph, it’s a historic statement for South Asians in football,” said UK-based Baljit Rihal, founder of the Asian Football Awards and an advocate for South Asians in football.“Seeing ‘Singh’ on the back of a shirt on the world’s biggest stage will be a powerful symbol of what’s possible. This moment can inspire a generation challenge outdated perceptions once and for all.”Having represented New Zealand in the under-17 and under-20 World Cups, the 26-year-old had his first taste of a global stage when he represented New Zealand at the Paris Olympics last year.In 2019, Bayern with one of the finest scouting systems in world football, had signed him from Wellington Phoenix, a Kiwi club that plays in the Australian A-League.Sarpreet started with the reserves, but impressed coach Hansi Flick — now at Barcelona — in training alongside the likes of Robert Lewandowski and Philippe Coutinho, to earn a first-team call-up. While it exposed him to the demands of top-flight professional football, turning out for Bayern when just 21, immediately put Sarpreet on a pedestal and he became an inspiration for young South Asian footballers.“It was a big thing for me personally and also for both New Zealand and Indian people,” Sarpreet recalls.A visitor to India in the past, Sarpreet has played competitively in the country of his parent’s birth. He was part of the New Zealand squad when they took part in the InterContinental Cup at Mumbai in 2019.“To be a Singh and come back and play in India, against India, was really special,” he said. Visits to India, family or football, opened his eyes to a different world. “I’ve been with my family to the villages where my parents were brought up, where my mum was raised. I got to see how people live life in India. It was an eye opener,” he said.Currently playing in Portugal, Sarpreet’s focus is on staying injury-free and playing enough competitive matches in Europe to help give him an edge at next year’s World Cup.“Throughout my journey, I have had lot of difficult times, which is why I kind of find myself now regrouping and rebuilding. Every career has some downs. I faced many challenges, but I think hopefully I can show that it’s still possible to keep going, to keep pushing and reach higher levels,” he said.",Sarpreet Singh is the first player of Indian descent to play in the German Bundesliga. The 26-year-old was signed by six-time European champions Bayern Munich in 2019. New Zealand qualified for the World Cup for the only the third time in the event's history.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119688378,imgsize-46470,width-400,resizemode-4/119688378.jpg"

A Spanish court overturned former Barcelona and Brazil footballer Dani Alves ' sexual assault conviction on Friday, citing ""insufficient evidence"" to uphold his presumption of guilt. Alves, 41, had been sentenced to four and a half years in prison in February 2024 for allegedly raping a woman at a nightclub in December 2022. However, the ruling was reversed by a panel of four judges in Barcelona.The landmark case was Spain's first high-profile trial under the 2022 ""only yes means yes"" legal reforms, which emphasise explicit consent in sexual crime cases. The legislation, introduced after national outrage over a 2016 gang-rape case at the San Fermin bull-running festival, defines consent as an active and clear expression of will, rejecting silence or passivity as agreement.Despite these legal changes, the court found inconsistencies between the accuser's testimony and surveillance footage recorded before the alleged incident. This led to the unanimous decision to overturn the conviction.Alves had been imprisoned since January 2023 before being released on bail in March 2024 after paying 1 million euros. He also surrendered his passports due to concerns he might flee.Prosecutors initially sought to extend Alves' sentence to nine years, while the victim's legal team pushed for 12. The ruling is subject to appeal at Spain's Supreme Court in Madrid.A decorated footballer, Alves won multiple league and Champions League titles with Barcelona, as well as Copa Americas and an Olympic gold medal with Brazil.","Dani Alves had been sentenced to four and a half years in prison in February 2024 for allegedly raping a woman at a nightclub in December 2022.

Barcelona secured a commanding 3-0 victory against Osasuna in the Spanish league, which gave them a three-point advantage over Real Madrid and extended their lead to seven points against Atletico Madrid, with 10 matches left in the season.Early strikes from Ferran Torres and Dani Olmo put Barca in command, with Robert Lewandowski coming off the bench to score off a header from Fermin Lopez.Manager Hansi Flick opted to keep Lewandowski out of the starting XI, introducing him late in the match. The Polish striker's goal took his league tally to 23, maintaining his position as the competition's top scorer.Barcelona maintained their impressive form with this victory, stretching their unbeaten sequence to 19 consecutive matches across all competitions in 2025.The fixture was initially set for March 8 but was rescheduled following the unfortunate passing of a Barcelona first-team doctor shortly before the original kick-off time.Torres finished a well-coordinated passing sequence in the 11th minute by converting a low cross delivered by Alejandro Balde. De Jong set up Balde with a precise pass, enabling the left-back to assist Torres, who scored his 14th goal of the campaign across all competitions.Later in the first half, Torres nearly added another goal when his free-kick struck the crossbar.Olmo extended the advantage by successfully converting a penalty retake in the 21st minute, which he had initially won after being brought down by goalkeeper Sergio Herrera.Although Herrera blocked the first attempt, Olmo was granted another chance when Osasuna's Jon Moncayola entered the penalty area prematurely.Shortly afterwards, Olmo was substituted due to what appeared to be a leg injury.Croatian international and Osasuna's leading goalscorer Ante Budimir was introduced for the final 30 minutes but failed to make any significant impact in attack.",Barcelona beat Osasuna 3-0 in their La Liga clash.

NEW DELHI: UEFA has initiated an investigation into alleged "" indecent conduct "" by four Real Madrid players , including Kylian Mbappé and Vinícius Júnior , during the Champions League round of 16 game against Atlético Madrid on March 12.The governing body has appointed a disciplinary inspector to examine the unspecified allegations.The case also involves Antonio Rüdiger and Dani Ceballos .Video footage circulating on social media appears to show Mbappé grabbing his crotch during celebrations after Real Madrid won a penalty shootout against their city rivals.UEFA's disciplinary proceedings could potentially result in suspensions for the players involved.

Madrid's compelling case

Follow Gerrard's lead?

Liverpool: Trent Alexander-Arnold 's proposed move from Liverpool to Real Madrid has split opinion on whether a local hero can leave Merseyside without a lasting stain on his legacy.Alexander-Arnold joined the Reds 20 years ago as a six-year-old and has gone on to win a clean sweep of Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, League Cup, UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup titles.His status is reflected in a mural that stands just metres from the club's Anfield stadium, emblazoned with the quote: ""I'm just a normal lad from Liverpool whose dream has just come true.""However, how he will be remembered for years to come in his home city will for many be dictated by the decision he takes in the coming weeks over his future.Alexander-Arnold's contract expires at the end of the season, meaning Madrid do not have to pay a transfer fee for a player who has smashed Premier League records when it comes to a creative output from a right-back.Here, AFP Sport looks at the key considerations facing the 26-year-old ahead of a career-defining call.Liverpool like to taunt their Premier League rivals with their six European Cups, making them by a distance the most successful English club in the competition's history.Madrid though are in a league of their own with 15 European Cup or Champions League triumphs, including six in the past 11 years.On top of the lifestyle benefits that a switch to the Spanish sunshine offers, Alexander-Arnold would be lining up each week alongside his close friend and England colleague Jude Bellingham , among a cast of stars also including Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior.The spotlight at the state-of-the-art, newly refurbished Santiago Bernabeu could also offer Alexander-Arnold the chance to fulfil his dream of becoming the first full-back to win the Ballon d'Or.""I believe I can (win it),"" Alexander-Arnold told Sky Sports earlier this season. ""It's only the morning after you retire that you're able to look in the mirror and say, 'I gave it everything I got'.""It doesn't matter how many trophies you win, or how many medals you've got. It matters what you give to the game and if you reach your full potential.""By running his contract down, Alexander-Arnold is in a strong position to make millions from a signing-on bonus in lieu of Madrid having to pay a huge transfer fee.And he can argue there is little more to be gained by staying at Anfield.Liverpool are 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League, meaning by the time his current deal expires, Alexander-Arnold should be a two-time English champion to go with six other major trophies.""His legacy, I hope, is one of an outstanding homegrown footballer who's done incredibly well for this club,"" Steve McManaman, who himself made the move from Liverpool to Real Madrid on a free transfer back in 1999, told the BBC.McManaman won two Champions Leagues and two La Liga titles in his four years in the Spanish capital and yet is being used as the counter argument encouraging Alexander-Arnold to stay.""It's about his legacy at Liverpool and how he is seen. Do you want to be seen like (Steven) Gerrard or McManaman?"" former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher, himself a one-club legend, said of Alexander-Arnold's choice.""He (McManaman) went to Real Madrid and won cups but he is not adored. If (Alexander-Arnold) stays, he will be remembered as one of the best to play for the club and not far behind Gerrard.""Alexander-Arnold is already the club's vice-captain and would be the natural heir to Virgil van Dijk.In contrast to the era of Gerrard, McManaman and Michael Owen, who swapped Liverpool for Madrid in 2004, he is part of a side regularly competing at the top of the Premier League and Champions League.Should he stay, Alexander-Arnold could be front and centre of trophy lifts in years to come as a local lad turned legend.But Liverpool are just the latest club to learn that the magnetism of Madrid is hard to resist.",Trent Alexander-Arnold's contract at Liverpool expires at the end of the season. The 26-year-old has been linked with a move to Spanish giants Real Madrid. Liverpool are 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119593701,imgsize-117496,width-400,resizemode-4/119593701.jpg"

Football superstar and Argentina's World Cup-winning captain Lionel Messi was in attendance at the Hard Rock Stadium on Friday, where Novak Djokovic advanced to the Miami Open final with a commanding victory over 14th-seeded Grigor DimitrovIn pursuit of his 100th singles title, and seventh in Miami, Djokovic won 6-2, 6-3 and will face upstart Jakub Mensik, who upset Taylor Fritz 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4) in the other semfinial, for the title.During his post-match court interview, Djokovic recognised that Messi, who currently represents Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, was present, referring to him as ""King Leo.""Djokovic revealed that Messi, accompanied by his wife and children, visited the locker room where they exchanged presents. While Djokovic had previously attended Messi's matches, this marked the first occasion where the football star watched him play.""Obviously, it's a thrill to have his whole family,'' Djokovic said. ""It's a huge honour. He's such a great athlete, not just a football player. His impact on the world of sports in the last 20 years has been immense.""To have him watch me live brings me great joy and excitement and also a little pressure.

I was touched by that.""The 37-year-old Djokovic's performance hasn't been up to his lofty standards, beginning with a withdrawal due to injury at the Australian Open in January. At Indian Wells earlier this month, he suffered a first-round defeat against Botic van de Zandschulp.During the third game, play was halted when security personnel escorted a disruptive spectator from the venue. The chair umpire descended from his position and approached the stands while summoning security staff.Dimitrov engaged in a verbal exchange with the spectator and proceeded to direct the umpire's attention to the location of the troublesome fan at the sideline.""It's just heckling, it's fine,'' Dimitrov said. ""I'm a very calm guy overall. I don't pick any fights but don't trigger me.''Despite Dimitrov securing an early break against Djokovic in the opening game, the Serbian regained composure and secured the first set in 32 minutes.The current men's record holder of 24 Grand Slam titles displayed remarkable serving efficiency, landing 87% of first serves with merely six misses throughout the match. He maintained exceptional control, recording only five unforced errors during the 70-minute contest.""Now I know how it feels to be (John) Isner and (Reilly) Opelka,'' Djokovic said of two serving behemoths. ""Maybe my serve has been a bit underrated.""Djokovic extended his dominant head-to-head record against Dimitrov to 13-1.

Fritz subsequently lost the next two points, sending a forehand long after a 20-shot exchange and netting a forehand on match point.Prior to the match, Mensik had a handshake with Messi.

Teenage tennis sensation Alexandra Eala maintained remarkable composure after delivering one of the WTA season's biggest upsets. The Filipina displayed minimal emotion after breaking world number two Iga Swiatek 's serve for the eighth time to advance to the Miami Open semi-finals.Despite her face momentarily quivering on the verge of tears following her victory, Eala remained composed. She celebrated modestly and proceeded with her post-match responsibilities with professional poise.""I think I was so in the moment, and I made it a point to be in the moment every point that it's hard to realise what just happened. It's hard to realise that you won the match,"" she explained, when asked about her immediate emotions to beating the five-time grand slam winner.""I really tried to soak it all in, because this has never happened to me before, and that's why I was looking at the screen. You know, I really wanted to keep that moment in my mind.""Eala exhibited remarkable poise in the biggest match of her WTA Tour career, showcasing excellent preparation despite her limited experience.""I don't have a lot of experience on the WTA Tour, that's for sure, but I do have experience with compartmentalising.

She has spent six years immersed in tennis, training alongside top coaches and aspiring tour players.Her disciplined approach stems more from family influence than her academy training.""It's not something I learned in the academy. It's something I've gotten from, I guess, from my experience as the things I have been through leading up to this moment. It's also something my family has guided me through, it's part of my family's values.""""They are successful people in business, they are successful in their own fields and people I look up to. I think they lead by example when it comes to that.""The match drew special supporters to her box. Her parents traveled from the Philippines, accompanied by an uncle and cousin from Seattle. Toni Nadal , Rafael's uncle and former coach, represented the academy.""So a lot of extra motivation for my match today. I really wanted to have my family see me winning, but I know they'd be happy just to see me compete in this setting.""""And Toni also came in to Miami. That did mean a lot, because I have been working closely with him for so long, alongside my main coaches from the academy, it showed a lot about the confidence and the pride the academy has in me.""Eala recalled a previous photograph with Swiatek at an academy graduation event two years ago. She expressed hope that her victory would inspire young people in the Philippines to pursue tennis.The 19-year-old from Quezon City joins a list of teenagers who have made dramatic entrances into WTA elite competition.

Miami Gardens: Alexandra Eala , a 19-year-old wildcard from the Philippines, produced a huge upset at the Miami Open on Wednesday, defeating world number two Iga Swiatek 6-2 7-5 to reach the semi-finals.Ranked 140th in the world, Eala, the first woman from her country to reach the last eight of a WTA 1000 tournament, took advantage of a unusually poor display from Swiatek, keeping her focus as she fought back from 4-2 down in the second set.Eala broke the Pole for the eighth and final time when Swiatek was serving to stay in the match at 6-5 down in the second set and looked stunned as she struggled to contain her emotions.""I'm just in disbelief right now.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka fought back in the second set to secure her spot in the semi-finals of the Miami Open , defeating China's Zheng Qinwen 6-2, 7-5 on Tuesday.This win marks Sabalenka’s first appearance in the semi-finals in Miami, where she’ll meet Italy's Jasmine Paolini for a chance to reach the final.It seemed like a straightforward match for the Belarusian against the ninth seed Zheng as she easily took the first set. However, Zheng made adjustments and came out strong in the second set, breaking Sabalenka twice to establish a 4-2 lead.Sabalenka faced significant pressure at 0-40 but, after showing some frustration, rallied to hold serve and tie it at 4-4. She then unleashed a powerful finish, breaking Zheng again to lead 6-5 and serving confidently to clinch the match.""Honestly every match is tough against her, I always have to work really hard to get the win and today was an incredible level from both of us,"" said Sabalenka.""I'm super happy to get this win.

Paolini sinks Osaka

Australia's Alex de Minaur put an end to Brazilian talent Joao Fonseca 's challenge at the Miami Open, outlasting the 18-year-old 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in an enthralling contest.Attendance on stadium court had been sparse throughout Monday, but the Hard Rock Stadium turned into a mini-Maracana Stadium for Fonseca's match, complete with Brazilian flags and football-style chanting.Fonseca brought his energetic brand of ultra-attacking tennis, but De Minaur was up to the challenge, coping with both the blistering forehands and the partisan crowd.Such was the dominance of Fonseca's raucous support that the referee switched to Portuguese for his appeals for quiet.But de Minaur won six of the final seven games to move into the fourth round, keeping his cool even when the crowd, at times, disrupted his serve preparation.""Mentally I was ready for this match, I knew I was not only going to play an incredible talent like Joao, playing with immense confidence and nothing to lose, but also an incredible crowd that was on his side from the first point until the last,"" de Minaur said.""One of my biggest strengths is my mentality and that is what got me the win today,"" he added.Top seed Alexander Zverev recovered from a slow start to power into the fourth round of the Miami Open with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Australia's Jordan Thompson.The German was 4-1 down in the first set but then went on a roll, winning eight of the next nine games to progress.Zverev lost in the opening round at Indian Wells, but with Carlos Alcaraz already out in Miami he will fancy his chances of adding to his list of seven Masters 1000 titles.Third-seed Taylor Fritz also moved into the fourth round beating Denis Shapovalov of Canada 7-5, 6-3.The American let slip a 5-2 lead in the first set, but regained control with his serve proving too much for Shapovalov.In the women's draw, third-seed Coco Gauff 's bid ended with a 6-4 6-4 loss to Poland's Magda Linette .Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka eased her way into the last eight with a 6-4, 6-4 win over last year's winner Danielle Collins of the USA.Next, Sabalenka will be up against ninth seeded Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen who reached her second consecutive WTA 1000 quarter-final, with a straight-sets win over Ashlyn Krueger.""I'm super happy to get this win in straight sets and happy with the level I played today,"" said Sabalenka.""She's a tough opponent, and we had a lot of tough and tricky matches in the past. So was very happy to get through this one,"" she added.Italy's Jasmine Paolini enjoyed a 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 comeback win over Naomi Osaka in 2 hours and 15 minutes.Since her comeback from maternity leave 15 months ago, Osaka has been showing some signs of getting back towards her best but Paolini was the first top 10 player Osaka has faced this year.""I don't think that I can say that I've played a lot of matches against top players like this in a while,"" said Osaka.""The way she plays kind of catches me off guard, simply because of her height. I didn't know she could hit like that,"" she added.Emma Raducanu continued her impressive form in Miami, cruising to a 6-1, 6-3 victory in 69 minutes over American Amanda Anisimova, who had eliminated Indian Wells winner Mirra Andreeva on Sunday.It is the first time Raducanu has won four straight WTA Tour main draw matches in a row since her US Open triumph in 2021. She will face American Jessica Pegula next.Raducanu, who has brought in some old faces from the early days of her career for this tournament, said she was benefitting from their presence.""I'm really happy with how things are on and off the court right now and just so happy that's able to transfer on to the match court,"" she said.Alexandra Eala, the 19-year-old from the Philippines who upset Australian Open champion Madison Keys on Sunday, was handed a place in the quarter-finals after her fourth round opponent, Spain's Paula Badosa, pulled out with a lower back injury.In the last eight Eala will face second seed Iga Swiatek who battled past Ukraine's Elina Svitolina 7-6 (7/5) 6-3.","Alex de Minaur beats Joao Fonseca 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in enthralling contest.

Alexandra Eala , a 19-year-old tennis player from the Philippines, achieved a historic victory at the Miami Open on Sunday by defeating Australian Open champion Madison Keys .This win marked a significant milestone as Eala became the first Filipino woman to defeat a top-10 ranked player since the ranking system's inception 50 years ago.The emotional victory saw Eala celebrating with her team, embracing them while fighting back tears.""It's a big thing to take in, and I feel it's important for me to take it in step by step. I'm so super proud of what I was able to accomplish, but it definitely fuels me more.""""I know and it's in my mind that I have a next match, but I need to stop, and I need to recognise that what I did today was really amazing. I think my reaction on court, you know, sums up pretty much how I feel about it.""At the age of 13, Eala's family made the decision to send her to Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca, Spain, recognizing her evident talent.The academy's exceptional coaching and facilities helped shape Eala into the 2022 US Open girls' singles champion and a competitive player on the WTA Tour .""The academy has been my home for the past seven years. Of course, my family should take credit for the foundation that they laid out before they sent me there.""""But of course, the academy was able to build on that foundation in such a way that I'm able to be where I am now. And I think the combination of everything that I've been through since I started tennis is what has led to this moment and what has led to me having all these opportunities.""The decision to move to Europe was made easier as her brother Miko also joined the academy.""It was definitely a big decision for me, for us. As soon as I heard that, I jumped at the opportunity because I knew that I had to get out of the country eventually to improve.""Eala's tennis journey began with her grandfather, a club player who coached her brother and cousins before focusing on her development.""I was kind of the next in line to do that and to spend time with him. It eventually blossomed into the career I have now.""Her victory came shortly after fellow Nadal Academy member Coleman Wong from Hong Kong defeated American 13th seed Ben Shelton in Miami.""I'm super happy for him and to see someone that I've known so long do so well is definitely an inspiration. Not just to me, but I feel in general a lot of people can take inspiration from him.""Despite her success, Eala maintains a humble perspective about being a role model for young players in the Philippines.""The young kids, the youth in the Philippines, they don't need to take inspiration from me. They can take inspiration from anyone they want. You know, they can take inspiration from other things, which is what I did growing up.""","Alexandra Eala became the first Filipino woman to defeat a top-10 ranked player since the ranking system's inception 50 years ago.

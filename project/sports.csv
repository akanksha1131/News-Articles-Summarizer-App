'Not going anywhere': Rohit Sharma on retirement from ODIs after winning the Champions Trophy

CHENNAI: Once Jasprit Bumrah was ruled out of the Champions Trophy , India were left without an X-factor in the bowling line-up.It was at this point that the team management and selection committee pulled a rabbit out of the hat and included mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy as the fifth tweaker in the 15-member squad. The planning was meticulous too. He was not played in the games against Bangladesh and Pakistan, who might have read him slightly better, and was unleashed against New Zealand in the third round-robin match.The 33-year-old had an immediate impact, taking five wickets against a team that had played finger spinners so well on more difficult pitches in a Test series in India a few months ago. It was followed up by crucial strikes – including that of Travis Head – against Australia in the semis and during the final. The fear-factor that Varun generated went a long way in Indian spinners maintaining a stranglehold over the Kiwis.Varun became captain Rohit Sharma’s go-to bowler in crunch moments of the title-winning campaign. Moments before lifting the silverware, Rohit lauded the tweaker for bringing “something different” to the table. Varun’s significant contributions – he finished as India’s joint-highest wicket-taker with nine scalps, although he featured in only three games – also meant that the Gautam Gambhir-led coaching group had the luxury of playing with only two pacers on pitches which had nothing in them for the quicker bowlers.While the spinner is the toast of the country at the moment, he was nowhere close to selection in the 50-over format not too long ago. But his performances in the T20Is in South Africa brought him back into the reckoning for ODIs.A national selector was sent to the venues where Tamil Nadu were playing their Vijay Hazare Trophy matches, just to monitor him. Varun did not disappoint, taking 18 wickets, and the decision was made: “If not Bumrah, it is Varun.”AC Prathiban, a former Tamil Nadu spinner who is Varun’s personal coach, feels it is the “mental toughness” and “meticulous planning” that have made the rise possible.“Mentality-wise, Varun is at a different level; he has been working a lot on it. He may have shied away from a few things earlier, but he is ready to face those now. He has shown a lot of courage,” Prathiban told TOI.“The last time Varun went to Dubai, the situation was totally different. Travelling to Dubai in itself could have been a nightmare, considering what happened (he had ordinary outings in the 2021 T20 World Cup). But he showed a lot of character to get into the team and win the title. Abhishek Nayar (current national team assistant coach) has played a huge part in the process, by being with him at Kolkata Knight Riders and the India team,” Prathiban added.Thanks to Varun’s extensive preparation in the lead-up to the CT, he had not just ‘plan A’ to outwit opposition batters. Instead of focussing on the individual, the slow bowler, who grouped batters based on how they approach the ball, looked at the category in which the player fell into. “Every day when he wakes up, Varun thinks about something new that he can do with his bowling. He spends a lot of time to prepare,” said Prathiban.“For different kinds of batters, his sequence of deliveries will vary. We planned the kind of deliveries Varun should bowl to every set of batters. If he is successful, what to do next... if there is a boundary, how is he going to respond... if he is looking for a wicket, what are the balls that he is going to bowl in the build-up. It works that way,” added Prathiban, who was in constant touch with the spinner during the CT.The volume of matches which Varun played over the last six months ensured that there was no break in momentum. “Varun’s body had to take a lot of load. He has hardly had proper rest since last year’s IPL. To remain a mystery bowler, he needs to train a lot and execute the plans well time and again. Only in a competitive game will he get to find whether he is able to execute the plans well. Since he managed to execute consistently in those matches, things became a lot easier for him in the CT,” explained Prathiban.","Varun Chakravarthy took 18 wickets for India in the Champions Trophy. The 33-year-old became captain Rohit Sharma’s go-to bowler in crunch moments of the title-winning campaign. AC Prathiban, a former Tamil Nadu spinner who is Varun's personal coach, feels it is the “mental toughness” and “meticulous planning” that have made the rise possible.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118868625,imgsize-65446,width-400,resizemode-4/118868625.jpg"

'Not going anywhere': Rohit Sharma on retirement from ODIs after winning the Champions Trophy

DUBAI : There are stars in the Indian team, and then there is KL Rahul . Retaining his place in the XI at the expense of a player of Rishabh Pant’s calibre, Rahul emerged as one of the biggest heroes of India’s Champions Trophy triumph.In almost every match, barring the one against Pakistan where he didn’t get to bat, Rahul delivered the perfect finishing act — 41 off 47 balls against Bangladesh, 23 off 29 balls vs New Zealand, 42 off 34 balls against Australia in the semifinals and 34* off 33 balls in the final against New Zealand.A crucial improvement in Rahul’s game was his approach against spin, using his feet effectively to attack bowlers. He demonstrated this in the final, dispatching New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner with authoritative strokes down the ground.Rahul’s rise was aided by the unwavering support of India’s head coach, Gautam Gambhir. After the semifinal victory over Australia, when questioned about Pant’s exclusion in favour of Rahul, Gambhir confidently responded, “Rahul’s average in ODI cricket is 50 (it’s 49.08). That’s the answer.”Praising Rahul’s composure after the final, allrounder Hardik Pandya told the host broadcaster, “Brilliant, calm, composed... he took his chances at the right time. That’s who Rahul is. He has immense talent, and I don’t think anyone can hit the ball as fluently as he does. Today was an exhibition of his class.”India captain Rohit Sharma also acknowledged Rahul’s invaluable contributions, especially in pressure situations, saying, “KL has been doing a lot of challenging work for the team for many years. I’m very happy with how he performed in this tournament, especially under pressure in both the semifinal and the final. The contributions may not always be 70s or 80s, but those 30-40 runs are crucial. When chasing, it can get tough at the back end, but with KL at the crease, we know he keeps both himself and the dressing room calm. I’m really happy with his contributions.”On his role as a wicketkeeper-batter, Rahul said: “Cricket is a team game, and my coaches have always taught me that you must do what the team requires. You need to accept that role and find ways to contribute. ICC victories don’t come easy—this is my first, and I’m over the moon.”","KL Rahul has emerged as one of the biggest heroes of India’s Champions Trophy triumph. Rahul delivered the perfect finishing act against Bangladesh, Australia and New Zealand. Head coach Gautam Gambhir gave Rahul the unwavering support.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118869180,imgsize-35164,width-400,resizemode-4/118869180.jpg"

'Not going anywhere': Rohit Sharma on retirement from ODIs after winning the Champions Trophy

DUBAI : As he basked in the glory of India’s success on Sunday night, star allrounder Hardik Pandya seemed overcome with emotion.Eight years ago, he played the lone warrior, single-handedly putting up a fight by smashing a blazing 43-ball 76 in a chase of 338 against Pakistan in the final of the 2017 Champions Trophy at the Oval. However, he was eventually run out due to an error by his partner Ravindra Jadeja.India went on to lose by a soul-crushing 180 runs, spurring changes in the team’s ODI setup. Clearly, the 31-year-old Pandya was delighted to have finally buried those ghosts.“I can say that an incomplete dream is over today. But eight years is a very long time. A lot happened in my life over those eight years. At the same time, winning — and that too for India — is something very, very important to me. If that happens, toh sab bhala (then all is well). And this isn’t just a dialogue; it’s a rule of my life.“I’ve always maintained that if Hardik Pandya doesn’t do anything, it’s fine. But if the team does well, it’ll be great,” Pandya, brimming with joy in his white jacket presented to the tournament winners, told reporters.“I hope everyone is happy back home and celebrating. I remember 2017 very closely. We couldn’t finish the job that time,” he added.Overall, Pandya enjoyed a fine run in the tournament, scoring 99 runs in four innings at an average of 24.75, with crucial knocks against New Zealand (45 off 45 balls) and Australia (28 off 24 balls, including three huge sixes) while batting at No. 7.With the ball, the right-arm seamer paired up superbly with Mohammed Shami. The Mumbai Indians' captain scalped four wickets in five matches at an average of 35.75, with his best performance being 2 for 31 in eight overs against Pakistan.The past year has been a rollercoaster ride for Pandya, from being removed as India’s T20I and ODI captain to being retained as the Mumbai Indians captain despite a failed campaign. The man has seen it all.“The year was full of learnings and challenges. My mindset has never taught me to run away from challenges. I have always believed that if the challenges are tough, throw some punches. If you don’t leave the battlefield, then you have a chance. If you don’t trust yourself, how can others trust you?”",Hardik Pandya says 'an incomplete dream is over' after India win Champions Trophy. Mumbai Indians allrounder scored 99 runs in four innings at an average of 24.75. The 31-year-old also took four wickets in five matches with the ball.

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma gave a special mention to the ""silent hero"" Shreyas Iyer after India scripted another triumphant chapter in its rich cricketing history.India clinched the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 title with a four-wicket victory over New Zealand in the final on Sunday. This marked India's third Champions Trophy triumph, having previously won in 2002 (as joint winners with Sri Lanka) and in 2013.All through the tournament, India's middle order has been the team's quiet protector, stepping up in critical moments—either stabilising the innings after top-order setbacks or forging crucial partnerships to steer the team to safety.""I am very proud of this team. We knew the conditions would be difficult, but we adapted well. If you look at all the games, the first game was against Bangladesh. I know it was only 230, but we knew that the wicket was a little slow. We needed partnerships. The batsmen made big partnerships. Not to forget the silent hero Shreyas Iyer throughout the tournament was brilliant He was very, very important in that middle phase for us. Stitched the partnerships with all the batters who are batting with him that semi-final against Australia with him with him and Virat at that point was very, very important,"" Rohit said in the post match conference.Iyer concluded the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy as the tournament's second-highest run-scorer, following a crucial 48-run knock in the final against New Zealand. With 241 runs in five matches, he emerged as India's leading run-getter and finished just behind Rachin Ravindra, who amassed 263 runs.Though Iyer narrowly missed a well-deserved half-century, he played a pivotal role in India's chase of 252, forging a crucial 61-run fourth-wicket stand with Axar Patel.Displaying composure under pressure, Iyer built a steady and vital partnership with Axar, ensuring India remained on track for their third Champions Trophy title.""And even against Pakistan and New Zealand, the league game that we played. And even today, to be honest, When I got out, we had lost three wickets. And at that time, again, we needed a partnership of 50 to 70 runs, which him and Shreyas have done. So, when such performances happen, when you understand the conditions and adapt the conditions as soon as possible, it feels good. So that's why my work is less than it should be,"" he said.""I don't need to speak much because the boys understand what to do in between. And not to forget, We are talking about batting, but keeping the bowlers, the teams, under 240s under 250 is a big effort. We make it in our minds that the wicket is helping the spinners. But you must have seen that in the fifth match, no ball has turned in such a way that the ball is turning every time, in every over,"" he said.""Sometimes, one or two balls turn in between, but that is the challenge that you are facing as a batter. You don't have to be ready for the ball that is turning. The straight ball that is coming, which is 80% out of 100, or 70%, you have to be ready for that. So, I think that is the adaption. And that is what these guys have shown in the middle, that this is how we want to adapt and play our game,"" the Indian skipper said.","India beat New Zealand by four wickets in Champions Trophy 2025 final.

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

""Arre nahi, main chala jaunga""

NEW DELHI: Team India head coach and former opener Gautam Gambhir is known for his intense demeanor, rarely seen flashing a smile. Staying true to his reputation, he maintained a serious expression throughout the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 final against New Zealand. Fully engaged in the game, he reacted passionately whenever India hit a boundary or took a crucial wicket.After India's four-wicket triumph over New Zealand, Gambhir, who secured his first ICC title as coach, surprised everyone with his 'shayari'.During a post-match interaction, he joined former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu in summing up India's victory in poetic style. Gambhir playfully teased Sidhu with a couplet, prompting him to complete it.""Gauti bhai… See…""""Forget about me. You please recite your sher. Or shall I?""""Alright. Go ahead.""""It's your sher.""""Fann kuchalne ka hunar seekhiye janaab…""""Saanpo ke darr se jungle nahi chore jaate.""Sidhu then playfully urged Gambhir to celebrate with a bhangra move, but the head coach initially refused outright.""Please create one more piece of history today. It’s a request from me as an elder brother. Show us some bhangra,"" Sidhu said.To this, Gambhir replied,(No way, I’ll leave).However, with some persuasion from Sidhu and Aakash Chopra, Gambhir eventually gave in, joining in for a bhangra step to the Punjabi track Sauda Khara Khara.This was India's third Champions Trophy triumph, having previously won in 2002 (as joint winners with Sri Lanka) and in 2013.","India beat New Zealand by four wickets in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 final.

"After months of struggle, Rohit Sharma rediscovers his spark, leads India to Champions Trophy glory",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-2025/after-months-of-struggle-rohit-sharma-rediscovers-his-spark-leads-india-to-champions-trophy-glory/articleshow/118833752.cms,"DUBAI: The past six months have been perhaps the most tumultuous that Rohit Sharma would've experienced since 2011, when he was ignored from India's World Cup team, which went on to win the tournament.Having just led India to an exciting chase in a severely rain-hit Test against Bangladesh, the 37-year-old was being hailed across all quarters for having ushered the team into an era where the team had started playing 'Bazball"" too. And then, all of a sudden, it all began crashing down when New Zealand toured India for a three-match Test series in Oct last year.A misjudgment at the toss backfired spectacularly-he chose to bat first in overcast conditions in Bengaluru -as India were shot out for 46 and went on to lose the Test by eight wickets. Jolted by the unexpected defeat, India ordered for square turners at Pune and Mumbai, but the Black Caps achieved a stunning, incredible 3-0 win. Amidst all this humiliation for India, Rohit's poor show-91 runs in three Tests@15.16 was highlighted even more. The worst thing was that on a turning track at Wankhede, he perished to pacer Matt Henry for 18 & 11.Things hit nadir in Australia, as all the veteran batter managed was 31 runs in three Tests@6.20. The signature, famous Rohit Sharma pull shot-he is perhaps the best puller in the game since Australian great Ricky Ponting- seemed to have deserted him, as the ball now travelled to the fielder's hands inside the circle rather to the stands. A slight bit of extra bounce seemed to rattle him. The situation became so dire that he even had to drop himself from the XI for the final Test of the Border-Gavaskar series at Sydney. To add to his poor form woes, there were rumours of his differences with India head coach Gautam Gambhir , and intense speculation about his future, and even questions around his fitness, with many mocking his waist size.After returning from Australia, Rohit played for Mumbai in a Ranji Trophy match at the MCA's ground in BKC against Jammu & Kashmir, but his struggles didn't seem to be over. He perished to J&K's seamers for 3 & 28, though in the second innings, his form did show signs of making a slow return towards him, as he hit three sixes-one of them being the vintage pull shot.However, leading India in their successful 2025 Champions Trophy campaign here, Rohit forgot all about his struggles with the red ball. Taking on the bowlers from ball one-an approach to his batting that he adopted in the team's interest to lay a solid run-rate foundation on the slow wickets at the Dubai International Stadium here, he put up scores of 41, 20, 15 and 28 before the title clash.It was a style of batting which didn't go down well with legendary opener Sunil Gavaskar . ""As a batter, are you happy with scoring 25-30 runs? You shouldn't be,"" Gavaskar told India Today before the final. The criticism was valid-for someone who has scored 11168 runs in 273 ODIs, the Mumbaikar is surely underselling himself by just being the enforcer. On Sunday night, Rohit showed what he could do by staying longer at the wicket, even if he was out in the 27th over. Rohit's 76 off 83 balls against New Zealand won India the final of the 2025 Champions Trophy. He was the player of the final.Talking to the media after leading India to their second white-ball title in two years, Rohit, while pleading the media to ""stop spreading rumours that he was retiring,"" said that batted with a bold approach purely as scoring with the old ball and with the spread out field has not been easy at the spinner-friendly DICS.""I have not done anything different; I have been doing the same thing that I'm doing over the past 3-4 matches. I know how very important it is to score runs in the powerplay, because we saw in not only one or two games, but all five games, after 10 overs it becomes very difficult when the field spreads and spinners come on,"" Rohit said.Rohit asserted that for him, a 30-40 in a winning cause gives him more ""happiness and satisfaction,"" rather than personal success. He cited the 2019 World Cup in England, where he cracked five centuries, but India crashed out to New Zealand in the semis as something which didn't give him much joy, as it didn't result in a triumph.""You may not see the consistency of big runs, but if I'm very clear in my mind about what I have to do. Then as long as I am very clear, I think it is pretty much okay. Today you saw that after 10 overs I changed my game a little. I wanted to play longer. But I went to put a bit of pressure and I got out. But again, you feel very happy when you win a match and when you contributed to it - It feels even better. I contributed a lot in the 2019 World Cup, but we didn't win. So, it wasn't fun. Even if you score 30 or 40 runs and win the match, you get more satisfaction and happiness. So, I think it was very important for me to do something and contribute and bring the team in a position where there is a little comfort for the rest of the batting order,"" he said.As a captain, Rohit has been flawless in the Champions Trophy-right from picking the side-pushing for Shreyas Iyer 's selection, selecting five spinners in the squad and four (including mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy for the last three matches was a masterstroke) in the XI, sending Axar Patel at No 5 and playing KL Rahul as the finisher at No 6, everything that he has tried has clicked. Since the time he took over the job full time from Virat Kohli in Nov 2021, Rohit is leaving a legacy of his own as a leader, having led India to four finals in ICC events, and winning two of them. There have been setbacks too, the Test defeats to the Kiwis and Aussies were bitter pills to swallow.""You lose one series here and there, it doesn't mean that the team is bad or things are not happening right, things are not going in the right direction. It happens, everybody is allowed to lose and we lost a series in India against New Zealand, the Test series. But that happens. It's like every time we take the field, we are meant to win everything. But that is not going to happen. This is a sport that we play. There are opposition who are also trying their best to beat us,"" Rohit said.It's not easy to lead the Indian cricket team, considering the weight of expectations surrounding it. However, Rohit makes it sound like it's a cushy job. After his latest victory as a Team India captain, Rohit termed his side a ""bloody good team."" ""There's not too much work that is done there. At the end of the day, you're representing your country, and everyone understands that. So that is not where I come into play. My job is to make sure that whoever we pick to play gets the job done for the team. There is a lot of hunger, even for the guys who have played a lot of cricket. So, these things are not supposed to be taught.""Giving credit to Gambhir and previous India head coach Rahul Dravid for the team's success, he said, ""It obviously is just not me.

India win Champions Trophy to extend white-ball dominance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-2025/india-win-champions-trophy-to-extend-white-ball-dominance/articleshow/118829886.cms,"Rohit spearheads tricky chase; Rahul, spinners too impress as India seal 2nd consecutive ICC Trophy win

DUBAI: These are the moments that Indian cricket fans live for. Soon after Ravindra Jadeja pulled Will O'Rourke for a four to seal India's triumph in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday night, the Saurashtra man blew a kiss towards the dressing room, where a joyous Virat Kohli and assistant coach Abhishek Nayar were hugging each other.Just a while later, Kohli and Indian captain Rohit Sharma -the two pillars of Indian cricket about whose future much has been speculated recently-indulged in a 'dandiya' celebration with the stumps, breaking into a little jig. Jadeja, meanwhile, blew a kiss to the dressing room and jumped into a warm embrace with his partner-in-the-end KL Rahul (34 not out, 33b, 1x4, 1x6), whose previous scores at No 6 in the tournament have been 41*, 23 & 42*.It wasn't easy against a spirited New Zealand in a nervy final, but in the end, India were just too good, and the deserving champions of the 2025 Champions Trophy- a title they have won for the third time. The best team of the competition by a mile, India won all their five games without a fuss, ignoring the chatter around the unfair advantage they supposedly had due to playing all their games at one venue. After clinching the T20 World Cup in West Indies last June, this is India's second white-ball event in two years under Rohit's captaincy. They seem to have finally broken their jinx of losing at the knockout stages of ICC events.The triumph offers Rohit the perfect opportunity to take a big decision on his glorious career, but for now, he, the rest of the Indian team and the millions of fans of India cricket must soak the taste of victory, which eases the pain of defeats in the finals of the 2017 Champions Trophy to Pakistan and the 2019 World Cup to Australia.Ironically, it was Rohit who led India's charge towards the win, stroking a sublime 76 (83b, 7x4, 3x6), with in-form middle-order batters Shreyas Iyer (48, 62b, 2x4, 2x6), Rahul, Axar Patel (29, 40b, 1x4, 1x6) and Hardik Pandya (18, 18b, 1x4, 1x6) all playing crucial roles to take the Men-in-Blue home in 49 overs for a four-wicket win against a New Zealand who were badly missing pacer Matt Henry-the highest wicket-taker in the tournament.Rohit gave India the perfect stand, dominating the Kiwi attack with his delightful shots in a 105-run opening stand with the in-form Shubman Gill (31, 50b, 1x6) in 112 balls. However, they then suffered a collapse, losing three wickets for 17 runs in 51 balls, as the Kiwis fought back with vigour, after initially looking like they were on their way to a convincing defeat.A sensational catch by Glenn Phillips-who has made it a habit to grab blinders-at short extra cover to send back the in-form Gill off skipper and left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner gave the Black Caps their first breakthrough in the 19th over. Soon, Virat Kohli (1)was trapped lbw while trying to play across to a Michael Bracewell delivery.Having shown the patience to score his first half-century of the competition, Rohit was guilty of throwing his wicket away when he danced down the track to Rachin Ravindra, but was stumped by a mile.However, the consistent, unsung Iyer, who benefited as he was dropped on 44 by Kyle Jamieson at long-on off an agitated Phillips in the 37th over, put on 61 for the fifth wicket in 75 balls with Axar to keep India's Champions Trophy dream alive and kicking.Iyer perished, caught at short fine by Ravindra off Santner, but with finishers like Rahul and Pandya, who added 38 in 36 balls for the sixth wicket to almost round off the chase, in their ranks, India were not to be denied on Sunday night.Earlier, capitalising on the conditions superbly yet again, India's spinners turned up the heat, but, riding on contrasting half-centuries by Daryl Mitchell (63, 101b, 3x4) and Michael Bracewell (53 not out, 40b, 3x4, 2x6), New Zealand fought their way back from a turbulent phase to score 251 for seven after opting to bat first.All four of India's spinners-Kuldeep Yadav (2-40 in 10 overs), Varun Chakaravarthy (2-45 in 10 overs), Jadeja (1-30 in 10 overs) and Axar (29-0 in eight overs) were outstanding with the ball-conceding just 144 runs in 38 overs while taking five wickets on a slowish pitch. While Kuldeep and Varun got more purchase off the track, Jadeja and Axar concentrated on keeping things tight by bowling flatter and faster. However, enduring a rare off-day, India's pacers Mohammed Shami (1-74 in nine overs), who really struggled to find his rhythm on Sunday, and Hardik Pandya (0-30 in three overs) conceded 104 in 12 overs, thus undoing the good work of the tweakers.India didn't help themselves by dropping as many as four catches, with Shami (dropped a caught and bowled chance that Ravindra offered in the seventh over), Shreyas Iyer (Ravindra again being the beneficiary, in the eighth over at deep mid-wicket off Varun), skipper Rohit Sharma (grassed Mitchell at mid-wicket off Axar) and Shubman Gill (dropped Phillips at deep mid-wicket in the 36th over) being the culprits.Fired by Ravindra (37, 29b, 4x4, 1x6) and the left-handed opener's 57-run stand in just 47 balls with Will Young (15), the Black Caps should've ended up with a far bigger total, before Varun, who was introduced in just the sixth over, earned the first breakthrough for India when he trapped Young in front of the wicket in the eighth over with a superb leg-break. It was then the turn of Kuldeep, who came into the attack in the 11th over, to turn the tide towards India with his very first ball as he castled the dangerous-looking Ravindra with a brilliant googly, much to India's relief.In his second over, Kuldeep netted an even bigger fish, as former Black Caps captain Kane Williamson (11 of 14 balls), came forward and prodded at the Chinaman bowler, only to spoon back the ball back to him.However, No 7 Bracewell, who had smashed a blazing 140 off just 78 balls against India at Hyderabad in the first ODI in Jan 2023, produced a wonderful knock at the back end of the innings, helping the Kiwis plunder 79 off their last 10 overs -50 off the last five-to put up a fighting total.","India beat New Zealand by four wickets in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy final in Dubai. Ravindra Jadeja took three wickets as New Zealand were bowled out for 251. Rohit Sharma top scored for India with 76 (83b, 7x4, 3x6) Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Axar Patel and Hardik Pandya all played crucial roles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118829870,imgsize-65450,width-400,resizemode-4/118829870.jpg"

KOLKATA: It's a paradox which seems to have come wrapped in desperation and which Indian football under Manolo Marquez couldn't simply sidestep.Marquez's decision to coax 40-year-old Sunil Chhetri out of retirement may have raised a storm, but India's Spanish coach emphasized that if current form is a criterion for selection, the veteran striker is an automatic choice. ""At this moment, he's the best striker… he's the best Indian striker and I think there is no doubt about this,"" Marquez said after FC Goa 's loss to Indian Super League Shield winners Mohun Bagan SG at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.""We need players (for the national team) who play with regularity in a single league. And yes, Sunil is one such player,"" the Spaniard added.In an unprecedented move, the All India Football Federation appointed Marquez to the hot seat last year, allowing him to manage FC Goa concurrently during the 2024-25 season before assuming the senior national team's coaching role on a full-time basis.However, the 56-year-old Spaniard insisted that his move to include Chhetri in the Blue Tigers squad for Asian Cup 2027 final round qualifier against Bangladesh - to be held in Shillong on March 25 - is intrinsically aimed at serving the national team's interest on an emergency basis and not putting up a barrier for the development of youngsters.Having failed to qualify for the Asian Cup directly, Marquez's India need to seal their place in the continental showpiece tournament via qualifiers. The Blue Tigers have been clubbed with Bangladesh, Hong Kong and Singapore in Group C of the final-round qualifiers with only the group topper being eligible to earn a ticket to the Asian Cup finals. ""At Hyderabad FC and now at FC Goa, (my job) is about development (of Indian players), but in this tournament (Asian Cup), you need to win and this is not the moment for developing players. It's not about… let's see if this guy who plays for this team in the league can score or not.""This is about the national team. You need a level, you need to play well as soon as possible. The most important part is the teams (in the group) who are coming at the top level. Obviously, we want to win and we need immediate results,"" Marquez told reporters. He revealed that calling Chhetri and making him available for national duty again was ""a difficult situation"" for him.""You can see who the Indian top scorer in ISL is - Sunil Chhetri. Who is the second top scorer among Indians? Brison Fernandes, and the third top scorer is Subhashis Bose. We need someone to score goals. I know Sunil has retired. This is the reason I spoke with him personally. It's a difficult situation for him. It's a difficult situation for me. But I know how the journey (of the national team) has been,"" Marquez pointed out.","India coach Manolo Marquez says Sunil Chhetri is an automatic choice for national team.

'Not going anywhere': Rohit Sharma on retirement from ODIs after winning the Champions Trophy

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

NEW DELHI: India’s advantage of playing all their matches in Dubai became a hot topic of debate the moment they kicked off their Champions Trophy campaign. Many questioned whether Team India had an unfair edge, as they played all their games — including the group stage, semifinal, and final — at the neutral venue of Dubai International Stadium . This scheduling decision came after the BCCI opted not to travel to Pakistan for the tournament.However, Pakistan pace legend Wasim Akram dismissed the controversy, stating that even if India had played in Pakistan, it wouldn’t have made a difference, given their sheer dominance in global tournaments.India clinched the title with a four-wicket victory over New Zealand in the final, marking their second ICC trophy in just nine months. Their previous triumph came in June 2024, when they defeated South Africa in the T20 World Cup final in Barbados.India’s supremacy was further highlighted by the fact that they remained unbeaten in both tournaments, reinforcing their status as the team to beat in world cricket.""This Indian team would have won it anywhere in the world,"" Akram said, speaking in the Dressing Room show on the Sports Central channel.""Yes, there were a lot of talks once it was decided that India would play all of their matches in Dubai. But had they played in Pakistan, they would have won there as well,"" Akram stated.""They won the 2024 T20 World Cup without losing a game, they went on to win the Champions Trophy without losing even one game which shows the depth in their cricket, that shows the leadership,"" Akram added.""If you remember, they lost 3-0 to New Zealand in the Test series at home, lost the Border-Gavaskar trophy, and lost the series in Sri Lanka. They were under pressure to remove the captain, the coach but sanity prevailed. BCCI backed them, said 'this is our captain, this is our coach' and now they are the champion of the champions,"" said Akram.","India clinched the title with a four-wicket victory over New Zealand in the final.

NEW DELHI: The incident in southwestern Congo, where a boat capsized resulting in the loss of 25 lives, primarily football players, highlights the prevalent issue of maritime safety in the region.The players were returning from a match in Mushie city, Maï-Ndombe province, when the vessel overturned on the Kwa River on Sunday night. Alexis Mputu, the provincial spokesman, suggested that poor visibility at night may have contributed to the accident.While at least 30 individuals survived the incident, as confirmed by Renacle Kwatiba, the local administrator of Mushie territory, such tragic occurrences are not uncommon in the central African country.Overcrowded vessels and late-night travels are frequently cited as contributing factors, exacerbated by the lack of enforcement of maritime regulations by the authorities.Congo's vast network of rivers serves as a crucial means of transportation for its over 100 million inhabitants, particularly in remote areas where infrastructure is inadequate or non-existent.Regrettably, hundreds of lives have been lost in boat accidents in recent years, as more people resort to wooden vessels packed with passengers and goods, abandoning the few available roads.The incident underscores the pressing need for improved maritime safety measures, including stricter enforcement of regulations, better vessel maintenance, and awareness campaigns to promote responsible travel practices.Addressing these issues is crucial to prevent further loss of life and ensure the safe transportation of people and goods across Congo's waterways.","The players were returning from a match in Mushie city, Maï-Ndombe province, when the vessel overturned on the Kwa River.

and records galore

KOLKATA: It was an evening Mohun Bagan Super Giant made their own with a sense of inevitability. A record run at home, record points tally and winning the biggest prize in Indian club football in back-to-back seasons - Jose Molina 's brigade brought quite something to the party on Saturday.They celebrated their Indian Super League Shield-winning show in grand style, defeating second-placed FC Goa 2-0 at the Salt Lake Stadium here and finishing their group stage with a slice of revenge against the visitors.FC Goa - supervised by India head coach Manuel Manolo - came into the match as the only other team after Bengaluru FC to have been able to conquer Molina's brigade this season. But they lost the plot in the reverse fixture, conceding two goals born out of individual blunders.On the first occasion, Boris Singh much to everyone's horror saw his back-pass with a header off an ambitious but misdirected long ball from Bagan defender Tom Aldred roll into an empty net with the Goa goalkeeper Hrithik Tiwari also leaving his place with the intention of claiming it in the 63rd minute.As if that dreadful defensive miscommunication was not enough, Bagan became the beneficiary of another clanger deep into the stoppage time. This time, India's defensive mainstay Sandesh Jhingan messed up big time in controlling the ball under pressure from Jason Cummings and Greg Stewart pounced on it to beat the goalkeeper with consummate ease.Mohun Bagan finished the league stage with the highest number of points (56), record number of wins in a ISL season (17) and an unbeaten run at home (11 wins and one draw). Goa's late chase for the Shield fell eight-point short.Long before the kick-off, thousands of Bagan fans made it an occasion to remember. They unfurled tifos highlighting the team's legacy and supremacy; they carried out Mexican waves and turned on the flashlight on their mobile phones to set light to the team's ambitions.Despite having clinched the Shield with two games to spare, Molina opted for a strong side giving only goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh his first game. It's, however, Goa who scored in all their matches in the group stage before Saturday and came close to scoring early on, Iker Guarrotxena missing the target by a whisker while Udanta Singh seeing his goal-bound attempt blocked by Aldred.However, the highlight of the first half came in the injury time when Manvir Singh did find the back of the net but Goa vehemently protested and referee Rahul Kumar Gupta eventually disallowed it after consultation with fourth official Harish Kundu, judging that Dimitri Petratos had touched the ball with his hand in the build-up of the move.Goa got a reprieve. But then came two individual mistakes, leading to their downfall in an uncharacteristic way.Bagan were already into the party mood. They brought the house down with another win; they rang the curtain down on the league stage by breaking new ground.",Mohun Bagan beat FC Goa 2-0 to win Indian Super League Shield.

Inter Milan extended their lead over Napoli at top of Serie A to four points after they were made to work hard at home by Monza before winning 3-2 on Saturday.Despite being heavily favoured against last-placed Monza with only 14 points this season, Inte found themselves trailing by two goals in the opening half.Marko Arnautovic scored just before half-time to narrow the gap, and while Inter dominated possession afterwards, they didn't level the score until the 64th minute, when Hakan Calhanoglu made it even.The winning goal came in the 77th minute when Lautaro Martinez's header took a slight deflection off Monza's Greek defender Giorgos Kyriakopoulos before finding the net.Despite their struggles, Inter's victory increased pressure on Napoli, who have managed just one point from their previous five matches ahead of their clash with seventh-ranked Fiorentina.Meanwhile, AC Milan faced a challenging away match against struggling Lecce, mirroring a similar situation to their city rivals. American forward Christian Pulisic netted twice, helping his team secure a vital 3-2 victory and avoid a fourth consecutive Serie A loss.Without their suspended French keeper Mike Maignan, Sergio Conceicao's team found themselves trailing 2-0, as Lecce's Montenegrin striker Nikola Krstovic scored twice.The tide turned when Antonino Gallo's own goal in the 68th minute gave Milan hope, followed by Pulisic converting a penalty five minutes afterwards.","Inter Milan extended their lead over Napoli to four points with a 3-2 win over Monza.

League leaders Liverpool secured a 3-1 victory against bottom-placed Southampton, with Mohamed Salah converting two penalties, while Nottingham Forest achieved a significant 1-0 triumph over Manchester City to boost their Champions League aspirations.Liverpool extended their advantage at the summit to 16 points, despite an underwhelming first-half display. Following their successful 1-0 Champions League win against Paris Saint-Germain, Liverpool manager Arne Slot selected three different players but was forced to make three substitutions at half-time to revitalise his team.Despite Southampton amassing merely nine points from 28 fixtures this season, they surprised Anfield when Will Smallbone scored just before the break. A miscommunication between Alisson Becker and Virgil van Dijk allowed Smallbone to tap into an empty net.Slot responded by introducing Harvey Elliott, Alexis MacAllister, and Andy Robertson after the interval, which resulted in two goals within three minutes before the hour mark. Darwin Nunez equalised with a well-taken finish from Luis Diaz’s delivery, before Salah converted a penalty after Nunez was fouled in the box. The Egyptian striker sealed the win with another spot-kick two minutes before full-time, bringing his season’s goal tally to 32.Arsenal, in second place, have two matches in hand over the leaders, starting with Sunday’s away fixture at Manchester United. Liverpool appear destined to secure their second league championship in 35 years.Elsewhere, Nottingham Forest opened a four-point gap over third-placed City after Callum Hudson-Odoi’s late winner at the City Ground. The former Chelsea winger beat Ederson with seven minutes remaining, courtesy of Morgan Gibbs-White’s assist, sparking celebrations as Forest defeated the English champions for the first time since 1997.The two-time European champions have not played in the continent’s elite club competition since 1980 but are edging closer to qualification.

Nottingham Forest dealt a major blow to Manchester City's Champions League hopes as Callum Hudson-Odoi struck late to secure a 1-0 victory in Saturday’s top-four clash at the City Ground.City’s uncharacteristically poor Premier League season continues, with this being their ninth league defeat, leaving their usual top-four finish in serious doubt. Despite six league titles in seven years, Pep Guardiola’s side finds itself in an unfamiliar battle to secure a Champions League spot.This was City’s first league defeat to Forest since 1997, putting them in a precarious position with just a one-point lead over Chelsea, who could leapfrog them with a win against Leicester on Sunday. A fifth-place finish might still be enough for Champions League qualification , but that depends on English clubs' performances in European competitions this season.Meanwhile, Forest’s remarkable transformation from last season’s relegation fight continued, as they climbed to third place, maintaining a four-point cushion over City. The two-time European champions are now edging closer to their first Champions League qualification since 1980-81.The match began with an emotional tribute to Stuart Pearce, who was hospitalised after falling ill on a flight. Forest honoured their former defender with a ""Get Well Soon Stuart"" message displayed on the big screen after three minutes.A cagey first half saw few clear-cut chances, with Nico Gonzalez narrowly missing from distance, and Josko Gvardiol setting up Phil Foden, only for Nicolas Dominguez to block his shot. Bernardo Silva then wasted an opportunity, failing to spot an unmarked Erling Haaland.Jeremy Doku forced Matz Sels into his first real save, while Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White failed to hit the target with a speculative effort. After the break, Anthony Elanga’s cross found Dominguez, whose volley forced Ederson into action.Guardiola responded by introducing Omar Marmoush, Kevin De Bruyne, Rico Lewis, and Mateo Kovacic in an attempt to break the deadlock, but the changes had little impact as Forest grew in confidence.City had a scare when Hudson-Odoi’s curling effort was brilliantly tipped onto the post by Ederson. De Bruyne’s free-kick was then comfortably saved by Sels before Hudson-Odoi finally broke through in the 83rd minute.Gibbs-White delivered a perfectly weighted pass, allowing Hudson-Odoi to cut inside and smash a powerful strike past Ederson’s weak near-post save, sparking wild celebrations at the City Ground.",Nottingham Forest beat Manchester City 1-0 at the City Ground. Callum Hudson- Odoi scored the only goal of the game in the 83rd minute. City's Champions League hopes are now in serious doubt.

Indian Wells: Defending champion Iga Swiatek edged closer to an unprecedented third straight Indian Wells WTA title Sunday, overwhelming Dayana Yastremska 6-0, 6-2 to reach the fourth round.Swiatek's 65-minute victory set the tone on a day that saw Daniil Medvedev spend just 10 minutes on court before ailing opponent Alex Michelsen retired.Swiatek, the world number two from Poland, was in full control against hard-hitting Ukrainian Yastremska, swinging freely as she won the first 10 games.She converted six of her 11 break chances and didn't face a break point herself and it was virtually over by the time Yastremska got on the board with wins in her last two service games.""It's always hard to finish a match like that,"" Swiatek said. ""But I'm happy that I got my intensity up the last game and closed it with confidence.""Swiatek next faces Czech Karolina Muchova , who trailed 3-5 in the first set but won 10 of the next 11 games to beat compatriot Katerina Siniakova 7-5, 6-1.Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva and 2023 Indian Wells champion Elena Rybakina joined Swiatek in dishing out bagels as they lined up a fourth-round clash.Andreeva, who triumphed in Dubai last month to become the youngest ever winner of a WTA 1000 event , beat Denmark's Clara Tauson 6-3, 6-0 in 63 minutes.Rybakina downed Britain's Katie Boulter 6-0, 7-5.Andreeva -- who beat Tauson in the final in Dubai -- said she found conditions on Stadium Court tougher than she made it look.""I'm just happy the way I managed to stay in the game,"" she said. ""I didn't give her much rhythm so I guess it was not bad -- but there's a lot of things to work on.""Women's fourth seed Jessica Pegula of the United States, fresh off her first WTA title of the year in Austin, was another quick winner, putting away China's Wang Xinyu 6-2, 6-1 in just 62 minutes.Pegula next faces Ukraine's Elina Svitolina, a 6-2, 6-4 winner over Danielle Collins.Medvedev headlined the men's lineup in the combined ATP Masters and WTA 1000 event, but he was barely underway when 20-year-old Michelson retired because of illness after dropping the first two games.""Food poisoning or something like this, these things happen,"" said Medvedev, who was headed to the practice courts to tune up for a fourth-round clash with 10th-seeded American Tommy Paul.Paul beat Britain's 2021 Indian Wells winner Cameron Norrie, now ranked 77th in the world, 6-3, 7-5.Eighth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas, coming off his first title in almost a year in Dubai, beat Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 6-3 in a rematch of their Dubai quarter-final last week.Tsitsipas dropped just eight points on his serve as he wrong-footed Italian with a variety of athletic shots, breaking him three times on the way to victory in 68 minutes.After months in the doldrums Tsitsipas said he was relishing a new mental approach to the game.""I just feel like I want to get out there on the court and be a gladiator, and that's how I approach every single match I get to play,"" he said.Tallon Griekspoor , the world No. 43 from the Netherlands who shocked world number two and top seed Alexander Zverev in the second round, backed up his big win with a 7-6 (7/3), 6-3 victory over France's 29th seed Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.Griekspoor fired 10 aces, dominating the first set tiebreaker, and didn't face a break point in the second set.Griekspoor needed an hour and 16 minutes to secure the win, but in a season in which dropping the first set has become an alarming habit that was fast enough.""It feels nice to win a match in under one and a half hour,"" he said.","Defending champion Iga Swiatek beats Dayana Yastremska 6-0, 6-2 to reach fourth round.

Former world number one Novak Djokovic , who has won the Indian Wells ATP Masters five times, suffered a surprising defeat in his opening match on Saturday, going down to lucky loser Botic van de Zandschulp, while reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz progressed to the next round.The 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic lost 6-2, 3-6, 6-1.""No excuses for a poor performance,"" the Serb said after the match. ""It doesn't feel great when you play this way on the court. But congratulations to my opponent -- just a bad day in the office, I guess, for me.""Van de Zandschulp has established a notable record against the big guns.His impressive victories include a remarkable win against Alcaraz at the US Open in the previous year, followed by a triumph over Rafael Nadal in Davis Cup, which turned out to be the Spanish legend's final professional match.""I think I kept my cool during the whole match,” said van de Zandschulp. ""I know if I go into the match and lose my cool, especially against the big players, it's going to be a really tough day. That's always one thing I'm trying to do well.""Djokovic reduced his unforced errors significantly in the second set, compared to his 14 mistakes in the first set and swiftly secured a service break, establishing a 3-0 advantage.He celebrated with a fist pump after striking a powerful forehand winner to the corner, earning his first break opportunity of the contest.Despite the intense exchanges continuing throughout, Djokovic's visible signs of frustration emerged occasionally. Although he lost his serve while attempting to close out the set, he succeeded in his subsequent service game, delivering a powerful forehand winner to the baseline to make it an even contest.But the momentum shift proved temporary. Zandschulp maintained consistent pressure through both baseline play and net approaches, as Djokovic's error count increased steadily.Zandschulp gained the upper hand with a break for 3-1, subsequently winning five consecutive games as Djokovic struggled to halt his opponent's progress.Djokovic exit followed a similar shock suffered by world number two Alexander Zverev and fourth-seeded Casper Ruud.The tournament's landscape has shifted dramatically, with world number three Alcaraz emerging as the highest-ranked player remaining, particularly notable given world number one Jannik Sinner's absence due to a three-month drugs suspension.Alcaraz, pursuing a remarkable achievement of three consecutive Indian Wells titles - a feat only accomplished by Djokovic and Roger Federer - commenced his title defence impressively, defeating France's Quentin Halys 6-4, 6-2.The Spanish player secured an early advantage to claim the opening set, before establishing a commanding 4-0 lead in the second set with impressive serving.His dominant display included seven aces and successful defence of the sole break point faced, concluding the match efficiently in 67 minutes.""I was nervous at the beginning of the match,"" he told a supportive crowd. ""The first match is never easy so I was trying to be focused on my game.""I just tried to be relaxed, as relaxed as I can.

World No. 2 Alexander Zverev , who suffered a defeat against Tallon Griekspoor in his Indian Wells opener, admitted that his ""terrible"" performance has pushed any thoughts of overtaking Jannik Sinner in the rankings out of his mind.Zverev entered the prestigious ATP Masters event in the California desert as the top seed, taking advantage of world No. 1 Sinner’s belated three-month suspension for a doping violation.Having finished as the runner-up to Sinner at the Australian Open, Zverev initially saw an opportunity to claim the top spot. However, with his current struggles on the court, that ambition is quickly fading.""Now it's less, because I'm just playing terrible,"" said Zverev, who made early exits at Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and Acapulco before his disastrous Indian Wells showing.He became the first men's top seed at Indian Wells to crash out in the opening round since Andy Murray in 2017.""I have to find my game before thinking about that, because to become world number one you have to win tournaments,"" Zverev said.""I'm not past getting first, second round at the moment. So I need to figure that out first.""Zverev admitted he had no clear explanation for his dip in form since the Australian Open.Before the tournament, he had cited illness during two of the three weeks of his ""rough South American swing"" as a possible factor.However, after his 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/4) loss to 43rd-ranked Griekspoor—who had been defeated in six of their previous seven meetings—Zverev conceded that he was simply not playing well enough.""I'm not playing a level that I want to play, definitely not playing anywhere near what I played in Australia,"" he said.After taking the first set against Griekspoor, Zverev staged a comeback from 2-5 down in the second to lead 6-5, only to be broken while serving for the match.In the third set, he saved five match points in the 12th game and converted his fifth break point to push the contest into a decisive tiebreak. However, he could not hold off Griekspoor any longer, ultimately falling short.""He played a good match,"" Zverev said. ""There's no question about that.

Brazilian rising star Joao Fonseca demonstrated resilience by overcoming a third-set deficit to defeat British player Jacob Fearnley 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 on Thursday at Indian Wells .The teenager, who earned his place in history as the 10th-youngest ATP Tour winner with his victory at the Argentina Open in February, said: ""Today was petty difficult, a lot of windy, but I got through. Beginning of the match I played really well and he was making some mistakes. But the second set he played more aggressive and I was a bit more tight, maybe a bit more nervous.""Fearnley seemed to gain the upper hand after breaking Fonseca's serve in the third set's third game, and subsequently held his serve for a 3-1 lead in a lengthy game that reached deuce on five occasions.However, Fonseca responded by claiming the following five games in succession, securing two service breaks and finishing the competitive match between the world's 80th and 81st-ranked competitors with a decisive backhand volley winner.In the women's opening round, Olympic champion Belinda Bencic from Switzerland secured a straightforward victory against Germany's Tatjana Maria, winning 6-1, 6-1 in a swift 65-minute match.The Abu Dhabi champion from February 2024, Bencic, who welcomed her daughter Bella in April 2023, has made an impressive return to competitive tennis following her maternity break.The 27-year-old Swiss player, who has exceeded expectations in her return to the sport, acknowledged that managing the playing conditions was crucial to her success in the match.""Obviously today the main topic was the wind, trying to accept it and not trying to make it pretty -- just staying in the rallies, trying to be more smart rather than playing amazing shots.""Japanese tennis player and Indian Wells debutant Moyuka Uchijima delivered a commanding performance to defeat former US Open champion Emma Raducanu with a score of 6-3, 6-2.The victory earned Uchijima a second-round clash against world number three Coco Gauff.","Joao Fonseca defeats British player Jacob Fearnley 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 at Indian Wells.

NEW DELHI: ""Learning, enjoying, and sharing time and experiences with these young and talented players,"" Rafael Nadal penned a post on X (formerly Twitter) not even a fortnight ago. The post featured an image of the tennis great at the center. To his left stood three teenage girls, and to his right, four more. On his far right, one could spot 15-year-old Maaya in her training attire, looking somewhat nervous, her right index finger tucked into her left fist.Nervousness was quite palpable - after all, the 22-time Grand Slam champion was right there in person at his Rafa Nadal Academy on the island of Mallorca, his watchful, forever-fiery eyes evaluating the teens.As for Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi , this was her first meetup with the ""King of Clay"" after taking the tennis scene by storm with her exceptional performance at the Mumbai Open earlier this year.But here's a fun fact: Mumbai wasn't even on her calendar at the start of the year.""First of all, playing the Mumbai Open wasn't even part of the plan. My wildcard was confirmed just 2 days before the tournament,"" Maaya, born to father Rajeshwaran and mother Revathi in a Tamil family, told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive chat. ""I was very confident that I'd compete well. Honestly, I didn't expect that I'd make it that far, but I just played match by match and gave my best.""Romping past opponents far more experienced than her, the rising star made waves across the tennis fraternity.As she reached the semi-finals at the Cricket Club of India and became the first 2009-born player to make semi-final of a WTA 125 event, some even clasped their hands in prayer, hoping for an outlandish title win. But a defeat to 27-year-old Jil Teichmann in the semis brought Maaya's dream run to an end.""After losing in the semi-finals, I was a bit upset because I didn't play as well as I hoped I would. But I had a lot of positives to take away from the Mumbai Open,"" added the rising star following the best series of results in her professional circuit so far.Even tennis was not part of Maaya's plan until she turned eight. For her, it was initially just a ""recreational sport"" after school.She decided to go pro when she was 10. At the heart of her journey are her parents, who, in Maaya's words, have been incredibly supportive.""I'm so blessed that my mom can travel with me. My home has always been my family, and also, I have a very good support system back home. Sometimes, I do miss them a lot,"" she told TimesofIndia.com. ""But specifically, I miss my dad so much. I'm very close to both my parents. I think if my dad would also be with me, I would feel very much like home.""At such a young age, staying abroad can make anyone homesick. Yet, this is exactly what Maaya had always wanted. She recalled, ""We were looking for a base in Europe last year, and the invitation from the Rafa Nadal Academy was quite surprising. But we were very happy that they took me in.""An avid reader and movie buff, Maaya also loves baking - baking, as she bakes, those chants already labelling her as the ""next big thing"" in Indian tennis. ""I'm definitely not worried about that. In fact, it's very supportive and encouraging to see people believe in me,"" she added.Currently, she is more into wading through the pages of the novel ""The Palace of Illusions"" by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni as Maya reflected, ""If I could tell something to my younger self now, it would be to trust myself and the good people around me, no matter what happened, no matter if I didn't win, I just had to do what I love to do with all my heart.""You've probably heard these sayings: A life without a goal is like a ship without a rudder, a car without a steering wheel... or, for tennis fans, Rafael Nadal without a Grand Slam (not quite a famous one yet), but you get the idea.What is it that always drives Maaya?""The ultimate goal for me is to become the world no. 1 and win slams,"" sighed the current world no. 1 Aryna Sabalenka's aficionado.","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi, 15, is the first 2009-born player to make semi-final of a WTA 125 event.

Naomi Osaka was bundled out of the first round at Indian Wells on Wednesday, falling 6-4, 6-4 to Camila Osorio in the Japanese star's first tournament since injury forced her out of the Australian Open.Former world number one Osaka, now ranked 56th in the world, looked rusty against the 52nd-ranked Colombian, struggling to find the range on her powerful groundstrokes on a chilly night in the California desert.Osorio, who challenged Osaka with an array of drop shots and slices, gained the lone break of the opening set for a 5-4 lead and served it out without a hitch, then broke Osaka to open the second.The Japanese star immediately broke back, but Osorio gained the upper hand with a break in the seventh game. After Osaka fought off a match point against her own serve Osorio served it out, fighting off four break points to seal it with a stinging forehand winner.It was a winning return from injury for Osorio, who pulled out of last week's event in Merida, Mexico, with an abdominal injury.Osaka, who returned from a 15-month break last year after giving birth to daughter Shai in 2023, reached her first final since 2022 in Auckland, but retired from the title match with an abdominal injury.Back for the Australian Open, she was forced to retire from her third round match with an abdominal strain.Osorio, owner of two WTA titles, booked a second-round meeting with Denmark's Clara Tauson, the 22nd seed, who took the title in Auckland when Osaka retired.Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, on the comeback trail seven months after giving birth to her son Petr, also fell in the first round.France's 70th-ranked Varvara Gracheva beat the Czech 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, but the 24-year-old was full of admiration for her 34-year-old opponent, who lifted the trophy at Wimbledon in 2011 and 2014.""If you let me step back a little bit, I really want to congratulate her,"" Gracheva said. ""Because she had a child quite recently, and I'm so happy that she now has the role of a mother and a tennis player, which is very demanding.

The WTA confirmed the person displayed obsessive behaviour.Speaking to British journalists at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, her first competition since the event, Raducanu described her distress.""I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, I don't know how I'm going to finish'.

I was like, I need to just take a breather here'.""Despite continuing after the individual's removal, Raducanu lost 7-6 6-4.She explained that her post-match emotional response wasn't primarily due to the defeat.Speaking to the BBC, Raducanu acknowledged that while the situation could have been handled more effectively, security measures have been enhanced.""I'm always now very aware and not necessarily doing things on my own any more. I'm always with someone and always being watched,"" Raducanu told the BBC.Previously in 2022, authorities issued a restraining order against an obsessive supporter who visited her residence three times.Raducanu is scheduled to compete against Japan's Moyuka Uchijima, ranked 52nd globally, three positions above her, in Thursday's first round in California.

Mérida:

World number four Jessica Pegula powered to her first WTA title of 2025 on Sunday, beating McCartney Kessler 7-5, 6-2 in an all-American final in Austin, Texas.Pegula, the top seed, claimed a seventh WTA title and her first since she won the 1000 event in Toronto last year.That was one of Pegula's two titles in a 2024 campaign in which she also reached the US Open final.In Kessler she stopped a fast-rising talent, whose first two WTA finals had yielded a pair of titles -- in Cleveland last August and at Hobart in January.The 25-year-old arrived in Austin riding high after claiming her first career top-10 player with an upset of Coco Gauff in the second round at Dubai.But she couldn't find a way past Pegula, who snapped a three-match losing streak in finals for a confidence-building crown heading into the prestigious hard court tournaments at Indian Wells and Miami.Pegula, the only top-10 player in the draw, dropped just one set all week.Kessler looked set to change that when she rallied from 0-2 down to take a 4-2 lead in the first set.But too many unforced errors from Kessler allowed Pegula to get back in front and after Kessler missed a chance to break in the 11th game she was broken in the next as Pegula pocketed the first set.Kessler broke Pegula to open the second, but Pegula won the next four games to seize control.Top-seeded American Emma Navarro capped a dominant week with a 6-0, 6-0 thrashing of qualifier Emiliana Arango in the final of the WTA Merida Open on Sunday.Navarro, seeded No. 1 for the first time, marched to her second WTA title without dropping a set, adding the 500-level crown to the title she won in Hobart last year.Navarro hadn't reached a final since, although she made it to the quarter-finals or better at the last three Grand Slams and came into the week ranked 10th in the world.She needed just 55 minutes to subdue Arango, becoming the first player to win a WTA final 6-0, 6-0 since Iga Swiatek blanked Karolina Pliskova in the 2021 Rome title match.Arango, a 24-year-old Colombian who made it past the quarter-finals of a WTA tournament for the first time this week, came into the tournament ranked 133rd in the world and will crack the top 100 when the new rankings are announced on Monday.","Jessica Pegula wins WTA title in Austin, Texas.

NEW DELHI: Former Asian Games bronze-winner in volleyball and the father of badminton superstar PV Sindhu, PV Ramana, offers a balanced perspective on the debate surrounding the challenges of pursuing sports in India, particularly for middle-class families.Ramana's own journey, from a lower-middle-class background to becoming the parent of a two-time Olympic medalist Sindhu, serves as an instance of opportunities that sports can provide.""My father died when I was 3, I was the youngest of 10 siblings. But my elder brothers and sisters, they were so happy to support me and see me play national-level volleyball, why? Because I got a Railways job because of that sport,"" he told PTI. ""So, if you are lower middle-class or middle-class, being good in any sport actually opens up opportunities for you. Not to forget, sport is great for a child's overall development.""While acknowledging the challenges, Ramana emphasises the importance of finding a balance between sports and academics.""Talent always reveals itself and is never a prisoner of wealth. As a parent, you have to find the balance. When I realised my elder daughter was academically inclined, I encouraged her to pursue that,"" he said. ""With Sindhu, she was way ahead of everyone on the badminton court by the time she entered 10th standard in school. She had found sponsors because everyone could see she was destined for big things. We should trust the children too. They also have instincts. I don't think as a sportsperson, one should discourage others from sports.""Ramana believes that talent is not confined to wealth and that parents should trust their children's instincts and abilities and should not discourage them from taking up sports.""Getting a job through sport is one of the major considerations for middle-class parents and from what I know, there are plenty of opportunities. Railways itself is hiring thousands of athletes,"" he added. ""Also, being good in sports gets you admission in premier educational institutions through sports quota. It is the responsibility of the coaches to guide young players through proper notification of job openings and other opportunities. All academies should be doing this.""Furthermore, Ramana stresses the role of coaches in guiding young players through proper notification of job openings and other opportunities.""We should never forget that minimum graduation is required for an athlete too (to find a decent job). These days, there is quota in jobs for retired athletes as well,"" he added. ""So, don't discourage, let the child flow. In my view, they should be encouraged to find balance and pay attention to academics also because you are not training the entire day. There is time for other things.""""During Sindhu's formative years, there were days she would ask me how was it that some kids in her training travel by air while we always took the train. But look at her now,"" Ramana said.""Struggle will be there but you have to be prepared.""",PV Ramana is the father of two-time Olympic medalist PV Sindhu.

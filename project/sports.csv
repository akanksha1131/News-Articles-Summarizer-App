Carlos Alcaraz secured his first Monte Carlo Masters final appearance by defeating fellow Spaniard Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 on Saturday. He will face 13th-seeded Italian Lorenzo Musetti , who overcame Australian eighth seed Alex de Minaur 1-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) in the second semi-final.Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz is seeking his first Masters title since his victory at Indian Wells last year. His only title this season came at the ATP 500 event in Rotterdam in February.""I knew how well Davidovich Fokina had played in Monte Carlo so I had to be ready to fight,"" said Alcaraz.""It's been a long time since I've had the chance to win a title on clay and I can't wait to try my luck again here,"" Alcaraz said, referencing his Olympic final loss to Novak Djokovic in August.""At the beginning of the week, the first tournament on clay, you have to get used to the conditions,"" he added. ""The ball comes different. You know, the play on clay is different... I'm just really happy to get the level that I wanted at the beginning of the week.""Alcaraz emerged as the tournament favourite following early exits by top seed Alexander Zverev and Novak Djokovic, while world number one Jannik Sinner remains suspended due to a doping ban.""The first question, you know, since Jannik was unable to play tournaments, a lot of people were asking me and talking about, how important (the) moment that I have ahead is to reach the number one (ranking) again or to win tournaments or whatever,"" Alcaraz said. ""I was thinking so much about it instead of playing my good tennis and enjoy the time that I have, stepping on the court and playing matches.""The 21-year-old Spaniard started strongly against world number 42 Davidovich Fokina, securing an early break. However, Davidovich Fokina fought back to level at 5-5 before losing the first-set tiebreak 7/2.Alcaraz broke early again in the second set and maintained his advantage despite Davidovich Fokina saving 13 break points and four match points.In the other semi-final, Musetti overcame a difficult start where he lost all four service games in the first set. The Italian regained his composure in the second set, breaking De Minaur in the ninth game.The decisive third set saw multiple service breaks before heading to a tiebreak, where Musetti prevailed on his first match point when De Minaur hit a forehand into the net.""It means so much. Honestly, it's unexpected,"" said Musetti, who will enter the world's top 10 if he wins the final. ""If I look back where we started, at the beginning of the week, I was of course dreaming to be in final and to have the chance to play for the top 10, for the title, for a lot of things.""The final will be a rematch between Alcaraz and Musetti, with the Spaniard winning their last three encounters. However, Musetti won their only previous final meeting in Hamburg in 2022.""For sure the key of that match was the mental part,"" added Musetti. ""So hopefully tomorrow I'll do the same.""The match represents a significant milestone for both players, with Alcaraz seeking his first clay court Masters title since Indian Wells and Musetti appearing in the biggest final of his career.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 in Monte Carlo Masters semi-final.

The win maintains their impressive 24-match unbeaten run in 2025 and keeps them on track for a potential quadruple this season.Second-placed Real Madrid face Alaves on Sunday, now under pressure to close the gap on the league leaders.Barcelona's performance lacked their usual attacking flair, but they managed to grind out the win following their midweek 4-0 Champions League victory over Borussia Dortmund.""The fight and the mentality the team showed today was great,"" said Barcelona manager Hansi Flick. ""(Madrid) have a match tomorrow but we're only looking at ourselves, three points is good and we had a great week.""""In the end what is important in these games are three points,"" Barcelona defender Eric Garcia told DAZN.

(but) I will say nothing and we will wait until tomorrow,"" Flick commented on the injury.The breakthrough came after halftime when Raphinha's low cross was deflected into his own net by Saenz, with Robert Lewandowski's presence forcing the error.Barcelona created several chances afterward, with Fermin Lopez missing a clear opportunity and Lewandowski heading wide from Raphinha's cross.Leganes thought they had equalised through Raba's header, but it was ruled offside. Diego Garcia also missed a good chance late in the game.The match concluded with a crucial tackle by Inigo Martinez on former Barcelona player Munir El Haddadi, preserving the visitors' victory.""The last save (by Martinez) was unbelievable,"" said Flick. ""Everyone celebrated this as if it was a goal.""The defeat leaves Leganes in 19th place, two points from safety.""It's so tough... we leave with empty hands against a Barca that, while it's true they attacked against us, they were not as efficient as usual, and you leave with a bitter feeling because we put in a great performance,"" Leganes midfielder Renato Tapia told DAZN.""We can do it (stay up), and I think today we showed it.""Jules Kounde had Barcelona's only other notable attempt in the first half, with his deflected shot saved by Leganes goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic.Teenage star Lamine Yamal forced a late save from Dmitrovic at his near post as Barcelona looked to secure their narrow advantage.Flick made tactical changes at halftime, bringing on Frenkie de Jong for Ronald Araujo and moving Eric Garcia into defense, which ultimately helped secure the victory.",Barcelona beat Leganes 1-0 at Butarque stadium in La Liga.

MS Dhoni returns as CSK Captain, confirms coach Stephen Fleming

Kolkata Knight Riders (Playing XI):

Chennai Super Kings (Playing XI):

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings suffered a major setback as regular skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad was ruled out of the IPL due to an elbow injury — a development that has paved the way for Mahendra Singh Dhoni to return to the leadership role. CSK head coach Stephen Fleming confirmed the news on Thursday. Gaikwad sustained the injury after being struck by a short ball from Jofra Archer during CSK’s IPL 2025 clash against Rajasthan Royals."" Ruturaj Gaikwad ruled out of IPL with fracture on elbow. MS Dhoni to take over as captain,"" Fleming told mediapersons on Thursday.“He (Gaikwad) got hit in Guwahati. He’s been operating with an amount of pain. We got an X-ray, which was inconclusive, and we had an MRI, which revealed a fracture in his elbow, in the radial neck. So we’re disappointed and feel for him. We appreciate the efforts that he’s gone to in terms of trying to play, but unfortunately, he’d be out of the tournament from now. We have an uncapped player, MS Dhoni, who will take over as captain for the remainder of the IPL,"" Fleming added at a press conference.Dhoni, who came out for the toss for CSK, also confirmed that Gaikwad was ruled out of the season. He made two changes to the Playing XI, bringing in Rahul Tripathi in place of Gaikwad and including Anshul Kamboj for Mukesh Choudhary.""We were looking to bat first. Quite a few occasions where we tried to chase it down and what we realised is that the wicket slows down a bit, so if you don't get a good start then the middle order comes under pressure. (On Ruturaj) He has fractured something on his elbow, so he is ruled out of the tournament. He is a very authentic batter, someone who looks to time the ball well. So yeah, he will be a big miss,"" Dhoni said during the toss.""(On the importance of winning this game) It is important now, every game is important. We have lost too many matches and now it is important to do the basics right - have dot balls, take our catches. A couple of games we lost by big margins, but otherwise it was about the small things - about one over going for 20 runs. Our batters are more authentic as batters, they won't slog everything. They just need to back their instincts. It is important to start well, get boundaries early on and try to get a couple of early wickets as well. Couple of changes for us - Tripathi comes in for Ruturaj, and Anshul Kambhoj in for Mukesh,"" he said.Quinton de Kock(w), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane(c), Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Moeen Ali, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Vaibhav Arora, Varun ChakaravarthyRachin Ravindra, Devon Conway, Rahul Tripathi, Vijay Shankar, Shivam Dube, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Noor Ahmad, Anshul Kamboj, Khaleel Ahmed","MS Dhoni returns as CSK Captain, confirms coach Stephen Fleming.

In one of the most thrilling double-headers of the IPL season, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Lucknow Super Giants pulled off memorable chases on Saturday — with SRH achieving the second-highest successful chase in league history and LSG hunting down a tricky target with clinical efficiency.At the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium, Abhishek Sharma delivered the knock of a lifetime, smashing a record 141 off just 55 balls as SRH chased down Punjab Kings’ mammoth 245 with eight wickets in hand and nine balls to spare. It was a night to remember for the southpaw, who brought up his maiden IPL hundred in just 40 deliveries — the third fastest by an Indian — and finished with the highest IPL score by an Indian batter. His brutal knock featured 14 boundaries and 10 sixes.Abhishek shared a 171-run stand with Travis Head (66 off 37) — the highest partnership of the season — which completely flattened the PBKS bowling attack. Heinrich Klaasen (21*) applied the finishing touches after Head and Abhishek departed.Earlier, Shreyas Iyer ’s 82 and Marcus Stoinis’ unbeaten 34 off 11 had powered PBKS to a daunting 245/6, but SRH’s power-packed top order made light work of the target. Mohammed Shami conceded 75 runs, the second-most expensive spell in IPL history.In the evening match, Nicholas Pooran’s explosive 61 off 34 and Aiden Markram ’s calm 58 off 31 helped Lucknow Super Giants cruise past Gujarat Titans’ total of 180. LSG raced to 61 in the powerplay, with Markram and skipper Rishabh Pant (21) setting the tone. Pooran then launched a brutal assault, smashing seven sixes, including a 24-run over off Sai Kishore, to put the game beyond GT.Earlier, GT openers Shubman Gill (60) and Sai Sudharsan (56) stitched a 120-run stand, but LSG’s bowlers fought back well, conceding only 60 runs in the final eight overs. Bishnoi (2/36), Avesh Khan, and Shardul Thakur were instrumental in the fightback.The wins helped SRH and LSG climb crucial spots on the points table, injecting new life into their campaigns.",Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Punjab Kings by eight wickets.

Why Washington Sundar credits Gautam Gambhir for improving his game?

Gujarat Titans skipper Shubman Gill expressed disappointment over his team’s inability to rotate strike effectively, as GT slumped to a six-wicket defeat against Lucknow Super Giants in their IPL 2025 clash on Saturday.Despite a solid 120-run opening stand between Gill (60) and Sai Sudharsan (56), GT could only post 180/6, a total Lucknow chased down with three balls to spare, thanks to composed half-centuries by Aiden Markram (58) and Nicholas Pooran (61).Reflecting on the loss, Gill emphasised the role of strike rotation on a sluggish pitch. “The wicket wasn't easy to hit from the get-go and this was the conversation — that if there's one batsman set, we have to play 17-18 overs so we can get to 200-210,” he said at the post-match presentation. “Losing back-to-back wickets didn't help our cause.”He pointed out that while the surface made free strokeplay difficult, GT’s inability to keep the scoreboard ticking cost them crucial momentum. “Our strike rotation wasn't as good as expected and that's something we have to work on,” he added.The defeat also saw GT slip from the top of the table, overtaken by Delhi Capitals .Gill, however, found positives in his team's fightback with the ball. “We were behind the game but if we got a few quick wickets, we could take the match deep. We got a few wickets after the 10th over but the ball didn't stop as much as we thought it would.”“Fighting till the end was a good sign for us.

Poll Do you believe the disappearance of swing from pitches has significantly impacted IPL bowling strategies? No, bowlers will always adapt Yes, it's a game changer

'Things can turn around quickly': Hussey after CSK's fifth straight defeat

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians ’ pace ace Deepak Chahar has opened up about a crucial change he believes has reshaped the nature of bowling in the IPL -- the disappearance of swing from pitches.In the pre-match press conference ahead of their game against Delhi Capitals , Chahar reflected on how the evolving pitch conditions over the years have demanded bowlers to adapt and dig deeper into their skillsets.Also See: SRH vs PBKS ""Earlier, wickets used to offer more swing. From 2009–2011, conditions helped bowlers more. Now, the ball doesn’t swing as much. Plus, teams are deeper — they bat till No. 7 or 8, unlike before. So the mindset is more attacking,"" Chahar explained.""Teams expect to score 70 in the powerplay now. Like Punjab — they were 80 for 5 and still ended with over 200. That’s the impact of the ‘Impact Player’ rule. It’s changed how teams approach matches. Similarly, bowlers now have to step up even more to keep up.""Chahar, who has taken four wickets in five matches, also praised the role of Jasprit Bumrah , who has recently made his comeback from a back injury.“Bumrah also had a serious back injury. We’ve talked about it. He understands what I’ve gone through and vice versa,” Chahar said of Bumrah. “At the end of the day, it’s a team game, but you also have to take care of your own body. You support each other, but only you can get yourself fit and perform. He’s mentally very strong. Even in his comeback match, his rhythm was on point. He showed class. His ability to bowl yorkers and bouncers with such control after a break is incredible.”Another interesting angle Chahar touched upon was the psychological difference in franchises.Having played for both Chennai Super Kings and now Mumbai Indians, he noted that while both teams share a winning mindset, the approach slightly varies: “In one team, you might have more meetings, more planning. In the other, it’s more instinctive. But at the core, both believe in backing players and focusing on the process. That’s why they’ve both done well historically.”""Mumbai has always built strong teams through brilliant scouting. They spot domestic talent early — like Bumrah, Hardik, and Krunal — picking them at base price before anyone knows them. Their strength lies in identifying the right players and backing them. Even if a player doesn’t have a big background, playing with Mumbai helps them grow,"" he concluded.",Deepak Chahar believes the disappearance of swing from IPL wickets has changed the nature of bowling.

KOLKATA: Football , like life, moves in cycles. As Mohun Bagan SG and Bengaluru FC (BFC) prepare to bring down the curtain on the 2024-2025 season of Indian Super League (ISL) at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday, the two finalists will also relish the opportunity of completing a cycle of their journey in their own way.Mohun Bagan coach Jose Molina is someone who never lives in the past. But as he was sitting next to his Bengaluru counterpart Gerard Zaragoza during Friday’s news conference, it was tempting to take his mind to that September 28 evening when his team capitulated 0-3 at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium, their heaviest defeat of the league this term.Having lost the Durand Cup final earlier, the just-arrived Spanish coach was staring at uncertain times until his team turned things around in a record-breaking run and took the form of a juggernaut. Facing BFC again, the incentive is now greater for Molina and his League Shield winners at home -- a maiden ISL ‘double’ in the club’s history.Bagan missed a similar opportunity at home a year ago having lost the final to Mumbai City. At their formidable fortress where they are yet to taste defeat in the league, it would be a mammoth upset for them to be condemned to the periphery of a title-decider again.Zaragoza’s BFC, however, will enter the final with the battle-hardened look of a team, with hunger and determination to finish the season with a flourish. Not long ago BFC looked to be a team fearfully ambitious to give Bagan a run for their money but they lost the plot following a dreadful run in Janunary.Zaragoza, however, reflected on a brutal, wounding result that had happened further back to make sense of the occasion.“Last year, (it was) another April 11, we played Bagan at home and lost 0-4. Now we are here in the final and facing them. This is the difference for my team between then and now,” the BFC coach maintained on Friday.“Now we are in the final mood,” he added with a smile.Bagan will certainly have the edge with the support of their proverbial 12th man — the fans. It will be quite an audition for BFC at the Salt Lake Stadium. Yet, don’t expect it to be an uneven contest. Sunil Chhetri , even at the fag end of his illustrious career, is still showing hunger for goals and his stellar form, by Zaragoza’s own admission, is giving him a good headache whether to start him or use him as substitute.Bagan aim to take the centrestage this time. But Chhetri & Co. will be there, armed with some old tricks, to put a spanner in Bagan’s ambitions.",Mohun Bagan SG and Bengaluru FC will meet in the final of the 2024-2025 Indian Super League (ISL) The two finalists will also relish the opportunity of completing a cycle of their journey in their own way.

Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) conceded first but rallied brilliantly to force three goals in their 3-1 win over Aston Villa at home in the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal at the Parc des Princes stadium.Following their triumph over Liverpool in the round of 16, Luis Enrique's squad now finds themselves well-positioned to advance to the semifinals for the second consecutive season.Villa, on the other hand, now face an uphill task to reach their first semifinal since their triumphant campaign in 1982 as they need to put up an exceptional performance in the return leg.Morgan Rogers put Villa ahead in the 35th minute, but PSG swiftly equalised through an impressive finish from Desire Doue. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia then became the focal point with his brilliant strike at 49 minutes, followed by Nuno Mendes securing a vital third goal in added time, providing PSG with a considerable advantage before the return fixture in Birmingham next Tuesday.Enrique, currently pursuing PSG's maiden Champions League title, managed without his captain Marquinhos due to suspension and opted to start without Bradley Barcola for the first time in this season's European fixtures.Doue and Kvaratskhelia joined forces with top scorer Ousmane Dembele to form the home team's attacking line-up.Villa entered the match with an impressive streak of seven consecutive victories across all competitions, while Marco Asensio, currently on loan from PSG, began on the bench against his primary employers.The away side adopted a defensive stance, with the first-half action concentrated in their territory. Dembele initiated proceedings with a fierce shot that required Argentine goalkeeper and World Cup winner Emiliano Martinez to tip over the crossbar.Nevertheless, Villa managed to secure an unexpected lead in the 35th minute through Rogers, contrary to the flow of play.PSG responded swiftly, as Martinez nearly conceded when fumbling Doue's shot, before the equaliser was scored from the ensuing corner. The home side manoeuvred the ball across the pitch to Doue, who advanced towards the box and executed a precise curling shot past Martinez into the distant corner.This brilliant display from the 19-year-old French international was surpassed by Kvaratskhelia's effort, as the Georgian footballer put PSG in front shortly after the interval.Emery substituted Cash at the break, following the defender's yellow card for a challenge on Kvaratskhelia.Disasi was brought on as a substitute but struggled to contain Kvaratskhelia, who received a pass from Fabian Ruiz on the left flank and moved into the penalty area. The ex-Napoli player outmanoeuvred Disasi with skilful ball control before unleashing a powerful shot that struck the near post and went past Martinez into the net.In stoppage time, Dembele set up Mendes, who went around Martinez to score PSG's third and decisive goal.","Paris Saint-Germain defeated Aston Villa 3-1 in the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal at the Parc des Princes.

Barcelona got a foot inside the semifinals of the Champions League after their commanding 4-0 victory over Borussia Dortmund in the quarterfinal first leg on Wednesday.The Barca dominance was led by Robert Lewandowski 's double strike, which has put the Spanish giants on the verge of their first semifinal appearance in the tournament since 2019The victory also extended Barca's unbeaten run to 23 matches.The five-time champions initiated the scoring through the in-form Raphinha, before Lewandowski reached his remarkable 40-goal milestone for the season with two clinical finishes.Young sensation Lamine Yamal showcased an exceptional performance throughout the match, skilfully adding Barcelona's fourth goal as Dortmund struggled to contain the onslaught.Barcelona, whose last Champions League triumph came in 2015, will travel to Germany next Tuesday, aiming to secure a semi-final place against either Inter Milan or Bayern Munich.Barcelona, the current leaders of La Liga, dominated early and broke the deadlock after 25 minutes.

Pascal Wehrlein’s journey to Formula E

Pascal Wehrlein may have clinched victory at the Miami E-Prix thanks to a dramatic turn of events, but make no mistake—his win was far from a fluke. The TAG Heuer Porsche driver is the reigning Formula E World Champion, having secured the title last season, and his latest triumph is yet another testament to his skill, timing, and tactical brilliance.Pascal Wehrlein’s win in Miami followed a chaotic three-car crash that temporarily threw the race into disarray. Amid the confusion, the German driver seized the opportunity to power through to the front in spectacular fashion.But this win wasn’t just about being in the right place at the right time. Wehrlein had already proven his pace earlier this season by registering the fastest lap in both the Sao Paulo and Mexico City E-Prix. Miami was less a lucky break and more a long-overdue reward for his consistency and form.Currently sitting third in the Drivers’ Championship standings, Wehrlein boasts of 1 win, 2 podiums, and 51 points this season. In total, his career stats now include 8 wins, 14 podium finishes, and 8 pole positions.The German-Mauritian driver started his racing career in karts in 2003 at the age of nine. He went on to enter the Formula 3 Euro Series in 2012 and then the DTM, before finally landing at Formula 1 . There he started as a reserve driver for Mercedes in 2014 and went on to make his F1 debut two years later with Manor Racing. He moved to Sauber in 2017 and even had a tiny stint at Ferrari before switching to Formula E.Since switching from Formula 1 to Formula E with Mahindra Racing in 2018, Wehrlein has steadily carved his path. After two seasons with Mahindra, he joined TAG Heuer Porsche in 2021. Though his first season with the team was winless, he quickly turned things around. With three E-Prix victories across the last two seasons, his Miami win only adds to a growing tally—one that seems set to climb even higher with many more races left on the calendar.More recently, Wehrlein has expanded into endurance racing , making his debut at the 2025 24 Hours of Daytona. He’s also set to compete in the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans.Off the track, Wehrlein has a stunning wife, Sibel and the couple are parents to their two-year-old daughter, Soleya.",Pascal Wehrlein is the reigning Formula E World Champion.

All about the race

The Qualifying race at the Miami E-Prix on Saturday was as unpredictable as it could be, especially for Nissan. The team’s Norman Nato took his first Formula E Julius Baer Pole Position for the 2025 Miami E-Prix as he competed with his former teammate Jake Dennis of Andretti for the top spot. Oliver Rowland, meanwhile, couldn’t do better than 16th position.

Dennis was also very close to António Félix Da Costa of TAG Heuer Porsche, who ended up in third place by a similarly slim margin. Robin Frijns of Envision Racing took fourth position, followed by Nyck de Vries in fifth.Qualifying on Saturday served up some of the biggest surprises as well. The most unexpected was Nissan’s in-form driver Oliver Rowland finishing 16th in Qualifying, as he had to abort his final lap due to an error at Turn 12. He has already won two of the four races this season.Sao Paulo E-Prix winner Mitch Evans of Jaguar TCS Racing also ended up in a less-than-impressive 14th position. Additionally, Jeddah E-Prix I winner Maximilian Günther of DS Penske came in last in Qualifying.Taylor Barnard of NEOM McLaren also faced disappointment.

The Miami E-Prix in Florida is set to bring the Homestead-Miami Speedway alive with the ultra fast electric race cars—combining high-octane entertainment with sustainability. As Formula E returns to this iconic circuit after a decade-long hiatus, race enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating high-speed action at the picturesque venue. Will Nissan’s Oliver Rowland and NEOM McLaren’s Taylor Barnard continue their season dominance at Miami, or will Jaguar TCS Racing’s Mitch Evans rise to the occasion with a win on U.S. soil? Only time will tell.The Miami E-Prix is one of only two single-header races remaining this season. The other is in Jakarta on June 21. Homestead-Miami Speedway is the fifth different venue in the USA to host a Formula E race—more than any other country.Saturday’s race will also mark the 137th race in Formula E history, and the 37th in the Gen3 Evo era. The new Gen3 Evo cars can hit 322 km/h and accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 1.86 seconds—faster than a Formula 1 car.Interestingly, the winning margin in the final race of each weekend has been steadily increasing with 0.099s in Sao Paulo, 0.125s in Mexico and 0.286s and 0.439s in the Jeddah double header.Meanwhile, the polesitter has finished on the podium in the last three races, in stark contrast to the previous stretch where only 2 polesitters reached the podium in 12 races.When it comes to qualifying, Oliver Rowland and Maximilian Günther are the only drivers to have reached the duel stages in every round this season. In contrast, Nick Cassidy, David Beckmann, Nico Müller, Robin Frijns, Zane Maloney, Sébastien Buemi, and Lucas di Grassi have yet to reach the duels.NEOM McLaren is guaranteed a record no matter which of its drivers wins in Miami.

Formula E is now in its 11th season since its debut in 2014, and the electric motorsport has achieved impressive success, carving its own identity despite the dominance of Formula 1. One of the key indicators of this success is the growing grid of 11 teams and 22 drivers—one more than the 10 teams in F1. While drivers like Oliver Rowland and Pascal Wehrlein have previously tested their skills in F1, it seems they've found their true calling in the more sustainable and rapidly evolving Formula E.Oliver Rowland is currently leading the Formula E standings with 68 points, thanks to his victory at this season’s Mexico City E-Prix. Rowland had a brief stint with F1 team Williams in 2018 before transitioning to Formula E, where he raced for Mahindra Racing and then Nissan, ultimately making a name for himself with the Japanese team. Antonio Felix da Costa, driving for Porsche, is also a formidable force in the series. He currently sits in third place with 39 points this season, continuing to prove his prowess on the track.Maximilian Günther has made a strong impression after his move from Maserati MSG Racing to DS Penske. At the Jeddah E-Prix, Günther took pole position, posted the fastest lap, and ultimately clinched the victory. With this standout performance, he’s now eyeing an even higher position, currently sitting fourth in the driver standings.German driver Pascal Wehrlein, another former F1 racer, began his Formula E career with Mahindra Racing before joining Tag Heuer Porsche. After winning the Formula E World Championship last season, Wehrlein has maintained his strong form, registering the fastest lap in two races this season—at the São Paulo and Mexico City E-Prix. He’s currently in eighth place with 25 points but remains a serious contender with 7 career wins and 6 pole positions to his name.Mitch Evans, a consistent presence with Jaguar TCS Racing since 2016, continues to be among the best drivers in Formula E. He secured a win for Jaguar at the São Paulo E-Prix in December, propelling him to seventh in the standings with 25 points, keeping him in the mix for the championship.At just 20 years old, Taylor Barnard is quickly establishing himself as one of the brightest young talents in Formula E.

Who founded Formula E

All eyes are currently on Formula 1 , as the season kicked off last month in Australia. However, there's another motorsport series that deserves just as much attention—one that not only thrills but is also in tune with the global movement for sustainability. Enter Formula E, the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship. Like Formula 1, it showcases high-speed racing, but with a key distinction: it’s environmentally conscious. Formula E uses all-electric cars, offering a cleaner, greener alternative to traditional motorsports while also driving innovation in the electric vehicle sector.Formula E cars are smaller, lighter, and require far fewer tire changes over the course of the season, which helps minimize their environmental footprint. And if you’re wondering whether these electric racers can deliver the same level of excitement as Formula 1, consider this: the Generation 3 Formula E car can reach speeds exceeding 100 km/h, proving that sustainability and speed can indeed go hand in hand.The ABB FIA Formula E Championship is currently in its 11th season, with the next race—the Miami ePrix—set for April 12. The season will run until July 27, with many more thrilling races scheduled across the globe.Formula 1 has been around since 1950 and has only evolved into hybrid vehicles relying on fossil fuels like E10 fuel (a mix of 90% petrol and 10% renewable ethanol). In contrast, Formula E is the motorsport of the 21st century after coming into existence in 2014. These races feature all-electric cars that run on powertrains converting energy from a battery into motion.One of the most striking differences between the two sports is how the cars handle tire changes. In Formula 1, teams often swap tires multiple times during a single race due to varying track conditions. In Formula E, however, teams are only allowed to change tires twice throughout the entire championship. The tires used in Formula E are made from natural rubber and recycled fibers, and are specifically designed to perform well in all weather conditions.Despite this difference, Formula E is by no means inferior. While a Formula 1 car can reach speeds in excess of 350 km/h, the new Formula E Gen3 Evo can reach 322 km/h, but it can accelerate faster than a F1 car. It can go from 0-100 km/h in 1.86 seconds., faster than many Formula 1 cars.Although both series use the same chassis, battery, and tires, the real performance differences come from the powertrains provided by each team. There is one aspect where Formula 1 still holds an edge, primarily due to the electric car's battery limitations. As the battery depletes, an electric car loses speed, requiring a pit stop to recharge in a flash. A Formula 1 car, on the other hand, can maintain top speed even with a quarter tank of fuel.Additionally, Formula E cars must be kept light—around 284 kg for the battery, which accounts for one-third of the car's weight that’s fixed at 840 kg, including the driver.Despite the technical differences, Formula E has its own appeal. Even Red Bull driver Max Verstappen has acknowledged how difficult it can be to drive the RB21. In comparison, electric cars in Formula E are simpler, with single-speed transmission and no gear shifts necessary, unlike the multiple gears in a F1 car.Currently, Formula E features 11 teams, with 22 drivers. Unlike Formula 1, where the top speeds are often the focus, Formula E records are typically based on average race speeds. The fastest race in Formula E history took place in Cape Town in 2023, with an average speed of 132.2 km/h.Practice sessions are held on Friday and Saturday, lasting 30 minutes each, giving drivers a chance to fine-tune their performance.Qualifying: Drivers are split into two groups based on their championship standing. Each group has a 10-minute session to set the fastest lap at 300 kW. The top 4 from each group then advance to the ""duels"" stage, where drivers face off head-to-head at 350 kW in a series of quarter-finals, semi-finals, and a final. The winner of the final claims pole position.The top ten drivers receive points using the standard FIA system (25–18–15–12–10–8–6–4–2–1). The pole position winner earns an additional 3 points, while the driver setting the fastest lap (if they finish in the top ten) receives 1 point.Drivers can deploy a combined 8 minutes of Attack Mode during the race. It provides additional power, activated by driving through a designated area of the circuit off the racing line. All Attack Modes must be used before the end of the race.A new feature has been introduced this season. It requires all drivers to make a mandatory 30-second pit stop to recharge their car's batteries at 600 kW. This adds 3.85 kWh of energy (around 10% more) to be used for the remainder of the race.Formula E was founded by Spanish businessman Alejandro Agag, who serves as the company's Chairman, while Jeff Dodds is the Chief Executive Officer.

The current Formula E season is in full swing, fueling even more excitement for this electrifying motorsport, where cars now accelerate from 0-60 mph in a jaw-dropping 1.82 seconds. With 11 teams and 22 drivers battling it out across 16 races at 10 iconic global locations, the season will run through to July 27. Since its inception, the Nissan Formula E Team has led the charge, but a number of other teams are rapidly closing the gap in a sport that blends speed, innovation, and sustainability.All teams are currently using the Formula E Gen3 Evo cars fitted with Hankook tires. These cars can reach a top speed of 322 km/h—the fastest for any Formula E car—and accelerate even quicker than an F1 car. Needless to say, the Formula E fever is rapidly spreading among motorsport fans. Among the 11 teams, Nissan boasts 21 wins in 136 races, along with 50 podium finishes. Envision Racing, Jaguar TCS Racing , and Lola Yamaha ABT Formula E Team are also among the top contenders.Nissan recently added another victory to its impressive tally. Oliver Rowland steered the team to a win at Jeddah E-Prix II in February, marking their second victory of the season after the Mexico City E-Prix in January. Rowland is now joined by Norman Nato, who took a transfer from Andretti.Tag Heuer Porsche won the 2023–24 Formula E World Championship, thanks to Pascal Wehrlein. This year, he remains in top form, having recorded the fastest lap in two races. He has been joined by Antonio Felix da Costa, the Season 6 champion, who is also performing well, having won four out of five races last season. The team now has 12 wins and 25 podium finishes in 78 races.DS Penske is also having a strong season, with Maximilian Günther claiming a victory at the Jeddah E-Prix I after taking over as the lead driver. Günther dominated the weekend by securing pole position and recording the fastest lap. Jean-Éric Vergne, the other DS Penske driver, is expected to maintain his strong form this season.Jaguar TCS Racing started the season with a win. Mitch Evans led the team to victory at the São Paulo E-Prix in December. Both Evans and Nick Cassidy earned four wins last season, alongside multiple podium finishes and pole positions. The team now has 17 wins and 47 podium finishes in 115 races.Andretti Formula E Team has been around for a while, securing 11 wins and 37 podium finishes. Driver Jake Dennis continues to impress, and he is now joined by new addition Nico Mueller.Envision Racing is consistently among the top teams in Formula E, with 16 wins and 53 podiums in 136 races. Both drivers, Sébastien Buemi and Robin Frijns, are experienced and remain in top form.Neom McLaren has 8 wins and 29 podium finishes in 91 races. Taylor Barnard, who became the youngest driver in Formula E history at 19, is now a full-time driver for the team, alongside Sam Bird.Maserati MSG Racing has been taking a slower approach, with 10 wins and 28 podium finishes in 136 races. The team has added two new drivers: Jake Hughes and Stoffel Vandoorne.The team recently faced a setback when Nico Mueller moved to Andretti after contributing significantly to the team’s success. Lucas di Grassi, along with rookie Zane Maloney, is competing for the team this year. Lola Yamaha ABT has 14 wins and 47 podium finishes in 119 races.Mahindra Racing has yet to fully catch up with the competition, having secured only 5 wins and 24 podium finishes, despite competing alongside top teams like Nissan and Envision Racing. Nyck de Vries and Edo Mortara are driving for Mahindra Racing.Cupra Kiro is trailing behind in the competition, but there is hope for the team this season, as David Beckmann set the fastest lap at the São Paulo E-Prix. Dan Ticktum is the other driver for the team.","The current Formula E season is in full swing. 11 teams and 22 drivers are battling it out across 16 races at 10 locations.

PUNE: It is fast becoming Shrivalli Rashmikaa ’s tie. So much so that the popular number answering to her name from the Telugu film 'Pushpa' has become the Indian team’s new anthem.From having not played a singles match until the start of the week to winning all her three rubbers in as many days, the 23-year-old Shrivalli has led the Indian challenge with style and panache at the Billie Jean King Asia-Oceania Group 1 competition in Mhalunge-Balewadi.The young star clinched the match for India against Hong Kong on Thursday after overcoming Hong Yi Cody Wong, another promising 23- year-old to watch out for in the coming years, 7-6 (6), 2-6, 6-3 in the second singles.Vaidehi Chaudhari, playing in place of Sahaja Yamalapalli who retired due to cramps in her match against Thailand on Wednesday, laid the foundation by beating Ho Ching Wu 7-6 (8), 6-1 in the opening singles. In the absence of Sahaja, the No. 1 mantle fell on Shrivalli and she wore it comfortably.The most admirable part of Shrivalli, besides her eye-pleasing stroke making, over the past three days has been her fitness.In the doubles, Ankita Raina and Prarthana Thombare saved four match-points but eventually lost to Wong and Eudice Chong 7-6 (2), 3-6, 11-13.In the other matches, New Zealand ground out a gruelling 2-1 win over Chinese Taipei, the two singles matches lasting nearly five and half hours, while Thailand bounced back to overcome South Korea by an identical margin.",Shrivalli Rashmikaa has led the Indian challenge with style and panache at the Billie Jean King Asia-Oceania Group 1 competition in Mhalunge-Balewadi.

PUNE: Ankita Raina and Prarthana Thombare pulled off the decisive doubles rubber to help India pip Thailand 2-1 in their second match of the Billie Jean King Cup Asia-Oceania Group 1 women’s team tennis competition on Wednesday. The Indians overcame Peangtarn Plipuech and Patcharin Cheapchandej 7-6 (3), 3-6, 10-3 to help the hosts register their first win of the competition at the Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex in Mhalunge-Balewadi, Pune.Shrivalli Rashmikaa once again put the team in front as she beat a higher-ranked Lanlana Tararudee 6-2, 6-4 but Sahaja Yamalapalli conceded the second singles against Mananchaya Sawangkaew due to cramps one game into the third set.With temperatures running in excess of 40 degrees Celsius for the fourth successive day, it was a gallant effort from Sahaja to level the scores 3-6, 7-6 (3). But the fightback in energy sapping conditions took a toll and the 24-year-old, writhing in pain, was helped off the centre court after two hours and 18 minutes of gruelling duel.“She is fit; we will see to it that she is ready tomorrow,” captain Vishaal Uppal said. India take on Hong Kong on Thursday.In the other matches, New Zealand beat South Korea 2-1 and Hong Kong upset Chinese Taipei 2-1.Shrivalli demonstrated her growing confidence while giving a winning start to the Indian team. The Hyderabad girl — with a smooth serving action and fluid, strong ground strokes on both the flanks — broke Tararudee twice in both the sets, although in different circumstances.Shrivalli — ranked 345th in the world, which is nearly 190 spots lower than her rival — nudged ahead 4-2 in the first set when Tararudee double-faulted on second breakpoint. The Thai saved the first one with an ace down Shrivalli’s backhand before the latter set up another chance with an accurate service return that landed right at Tararudee’s feet.Tararudee, impressive with her accuracy and placement, upped her intensity in the following game, pulling Shrivalli wide and opening up the court. But the Indian did well to hold off the challenge. Shrivalli rode on the momentum to close the set in the 10th game when Tararudee put an overhead smash into the net on breakpoint.The 23-year-old Indian dropped serve in the opening game of the second set against the run of play and it seemed Tararudee, world No. 166, had taken control of the proceedings for a while. Shrivalli then turned it around brilliantly when, trailing 2-4, took the next four games in a row to clinch the match.The focus then shifted on Sahaja, who ran away to a 3-0 lead.","Ankita Raina and Prarthana Thombare pull off the decisive doubles rubber to help India pip Thailand 2-1 in their second match of the Billie Jean King Cup Asia- Oceania Group 1 women’s team tennis competition.

PUNE: India's young women tennis players have produced sparks of brilliance in recent times. They have a chance to step up to the next level when they compete in the AsiaOceania Group 1 competition of the Billie Jean King Cup , starting here on Tuesday.The Indian women barely managed to stay in the group after finishing fourth in the six-team event, held in China, last year. With Japan and the hosts having advanced to the Qualifiers, this edition presents Vishaal Uppal’s side with the best chance to go through to the playoffs.Team captain Uppal, a former Davis Cupper, has led the team to the World Group playoffs in 2020, a first for the Indian women. They lost to Latvia away the following year. Four years on, things couldn’t have been more different.The highest-ranked player in the field is World No. 41 Lulu Sun from New Zealand. The 23-year-old of mixed heritage caught the attention with her quarterfinal run at the Wimbledon as a qualifier last year, beating then World No. 8 Qinwen Zheng in the first round. Besides Sun, Thailand’s Mananchaya Sawangkaew (world ranked 110) and Lanlana Tararudee (166) as well as Joanna Garland of Chinese Taipei pose a major threat.“It’s a very even group. If you see the rankings of all the teams, they’re very similar, not much to choose from. So that makes the group very tough and very competitive,” Uppal said.Changes have swept through the Indian team as well. None of the players is ranked in the top-300, unlike in 2021 when Ankita Raina was 183. The side is also without Karman Kaur Thandi, who had broken into the top-200 in 2018 but is currently unranked owing to a lengthy injury layoff. Yet, Shrivalli Rashmikaa and Sahaja Yamalapalli have kept the hopes alive with some stand-out performances.There couldn’t have been a stronger fourth singles player than Vaidehee Chaudhari while Prarthana Thombare brings in the much needed experience and solidity as the doubles player.",India's women play in the AsiaOceania Group 1 competition of the Billie Jean King Cup.

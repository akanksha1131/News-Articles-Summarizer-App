Harshit Rana press conference: On social media trolls, outside noise, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma

Poll Do you believe Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma should continue their ODI careers until the 2027 World Cup? Yes, they should No, it's time for new players Only if they keep performing well

NEW DELHI: World Cup-winning former India cricketer Madan Lal has thrown his weight behind Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , insisting that the two batting giants must be allowed to decide the course of their international futures. In a strong endorsement of their longevity and current form, Lal said both players “still seem to have steam left” and look nowhere near the end of their ODI careers.Kohli and Rohit, who have retired from T20Is and Test cricket, remain active in the ODI setup and are eyeing a spot in the 2027 World Cup squad. Their recent performances back their ambition — both have played pivotal roles in India’s ODI wins against Australia and South Africa.Speaking to PTI Videos, Lal stressed that nobody should dictate the future of the two modern greats. “It is their decision and not anybody else’s. So (it should be) whatever they decide,” he said.Lal was effusive in his praise for their intensity and physical conditioning. “The way they are playing the ODI series shows that they are still very, very fresh and look like they are some 28 or 30-years-old,” he remarked. He singled out Kohli’s energy on the field: “The way Virat Kohli is running between the wickets, taking the singles and hitting the balls.It’s nice to see the way they are going.”The 1983 World Cup winner also reflected on the pressures faced by selectors and coaches — roles he once held. “The first person to be criticised is the coach and the selector… they will get the criticism, never mind. As long as your conscience is right, that matters,” Lal stated. He added that scrutiny often intensifies when the team fails, saying, “If the team is not doing good then it becomes a case of critics going after the selectors… your coach is as good as your team. ”Recalling his stint during Sachin Tendulkar ’s captaincy, Lal admitted errors are unavoidable. “I, as a coach when Sachin was… I have made mistakes and they are part of the game,” he conceded.",Madan Lal backs Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to continue their ODI careers. The 1983 World Cup winner says the two batting giants must be allowed to decide the course of their international futures.

Smriti Mandhana & Palash Muchhal Add Evil Eye Emoji To Bios Amid Cheating Rumours!

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket star Smriti Mandhana and music composer Palash Muchhal continue to dominate headlines, not for their professional achievements but for the emotional rollercoaster surrounding their postponed wedding. The high-profile ceremony, originally scheduled for November 23 in Sangli, was abruptly halted after Smriti’s father, Srinivas Mandhana, suffered a sudden medical emergency and was rushed to hospital. Hours later, Palash too was admitted due to stress-induced health concerns. Both have since recovered, but the families have not announced a new date.On Tuesday, social media went into overdrive after rumours claimed that the couple would now marry on December 7, prompting widespread speculation. However, Smriti’s brother Shravan Mandhana has now firmly shut down the reports.Speaking to Hindustan Times, Shravan addressed the swirling chatter head-on. “I have no idea about these rumours. As of now, it (the wedding) is still postponed,” he said, dismissing the December 7 claims and making it clear that no fresh date has been finalised.The rumour mill intensified after fans noticed that Smriti had deleted all wedding-related posts from her Instagram account following the postponement — though casual photos with Palash remain.With no official communication from either family, the speculative frenzy only grew.Meanwhile, Palash’s mother Amita Muchhal had earlier shared that both families are still recovering from the emotional shock of the disrupted ceremony. She revealed that Palash had dreamt of bringing his bride home and that she had even planned a special welcome. Despite the heartbreak, she expressed optimism: “Everything will be fine, shaadi bohot jaldi hogi.”The situation has also drawn heartfelt support from the cricketing community. Veteran actor Suniel Shetty lauded Jemimah Rodrigues for withdrawing from the WBBL to stand by Smriti, calling it “the purest form of friendship.”","Smriti Mandhana and Palash Muchhal's wedding was postponed on November 23.

Erling Haaland carved his name deeper into Premier League folklore on Tuesday night, becoming the fastest player in history to reach 100 Premier League goals as Manchester City edged Fulham 5–4 in a pulsating contest at Craven Cottage. The Norwegian superstar reached the landmark in just 111 league appearances, obliterating Alan Shearer’s long-standing record of 124 matches.Haaland’s milestone moment came in the 17th minute when Jeremy Doku picked him out with a sharp cut-back. The striker timed his run perfectly and hammered a ferocious finish past Bernd Leno — his 15th league goal of the season and 20th in all competitions.Pep Guardiola could only marvel at his No. 9. “It’s incredible, impressive… He was unbelievable today,” the City boss said. “Hopefully he’s starving hungry to continue with this club to make more and more goals.”Haaland later turned provider, slipping a clever pass to Tijjani Reijnders for City’s second before Phil Foden took charge, scoring twice as City raced into a seemingly unassailable 5–1 lead.But the night nearly turned disastrous. Fulham mounted a furious comeback, with goals from Emile Smith Rowe, Alex Iwobi and a brace from Samuel Chukwueze dragging the match to the brink of a historic upset.Only Josko Gvardiol’s last-gasp goal-line clearance denied Josh King an equaliser in stoppage time.Despite the win, Guardiola looked exasperated as his side once again flirted with collapse. “Of course I was concerned,” he admitted. “This will help us in future games… I’m so old, and the players don’t respect me!” he joked, reflecting the tension of the chaotic final half hour.City, now just two points behind leaders Arsenal, know they will need Haaland firing relentlessly if they are to secure a seventh league title under Guardiola. After going three matches without a goal, the 25-year-old ended his mini-drought in style — with a record that may stand for generations.","Erling Haaland became the fastest player in Premier League history to reach 100 Premier League goals as Manchester City beat Fulham 5-4.

ILT20: How India connect can help the league grow even further | Laxmi Shetty Interview

England captain Ben Stokes has delivered a defiant message amid intense scrutiny on his team during the ongoing Ashes tour, insisting that no amount of media attention will stop the players from enjoying their time in Australia. Stokes, known for his combative spirit both on and off the field, said the glare of cameras and headlines is “part and parcel” of touring Down Under — and far better than enduring England’s gloomy winter.The England squad has been under constant watch since arriving for the five-Test series, trailed at airports, golf courses and even during a visit to an aquarium. This week, Stokes and a few teammates were photographed riding electric scooters around Brisbane without helmets — prompting a sensational “Pommy Idiots” front page from The Courier-Mail. Queensland Police later confirmed they had cautioned the group about helmet laws.But Stokes brushed aside the uproar, saying such incidents won’t affect team morale. “If they think it is going to stop us enjoying this country when we have time off then it is not going to do that,” he told the BBC.Stokes went on to praise Australia as the best destination for a cricket tour. “There are so many things to do… great golf courses, coffee shops and easy places to have lunch,” he said, adding that downtime is vital for players facing the pressure of an Ashes campaign.The England captain also took a light-hearted swipe at the British winter, remarking: “We need to enjoy countries when we get the opportunity because we live in England where it is miserable, freezing cold and dark at 4pm.”England are now gearing up for the second Test in Brisbane, starting Thursday, after suffering a heavy eight-wicket defeat in the Perth opener inside two days.","England captain Ben Stokes says media attention is 'part and parcel' of Ashes tour.

Still have doubts? Virat Kohli blows World Cup trumpet with another masterclass

NEW DELHI: Fresh off their commanding win in the series opener in Ranchi, senior pros Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma showed no signs of easing up as they put in a high-intensity training shift ahead of the second ODI. The match is scheduled for Wednesday at the Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh International Stadium in Raipur.Despite the growing chatter around their futures and the team’s long-term roadmap, both Kohli and Rohit appeared unfazed. The experienced pair trained side by side, facing a barrage of deliveries from India’s throw-down specialists during an extended net session.Kohli, in particular, appeared sharp and focused, taking on Raghu’s right-arm pace and Nuwan Seneviratne’s left-arm angles with intent. Under the floodlights, the former captain timed most balls sweetly, though a few fiery deliveries from Raghu zipped past his bat — a reminder of the pace on offer.Head coach Gautam Gambhir watched the action closely, positioned between the nets and keeping a keen eye on proceedings.However, one moment drew attention — after finishing his batting stint, Kohli rested both bats on his shoulders and walked past Gambhir without any exchange.Given recent headlines involving the two, the moment sparked instant curiosity.Rohit, who wrapped up his session shortly after, did pause briefly to chat with Gambhir before heading indoors.Amid the buzz, a clip of former India pacer Sreesanth has been circulating on social media, where he makes a clear appeal to the head coach.“Roko ko mat roko (don’t stop Rohit and Kohli). I will just suggest to Gautam Gambhir that he shouldn’t stop Rohit and Virat at all. Until they want to feature in the ODI series, they should keep on playing. Because they are a thousand times better than the ones currently playing. So all the best to Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.

Still have doubts? Virat Kohli blows World Cup trumpet with another masterclass

India may have drawn first blood in the Ranchi ODI against South Africa, but head coach Gautam Gambhir continues to remain under a cloud of criticism following the recent Test series debacle. India were blanked 2-0 by the Proteas, adding to an already tense atmosphere around Gambhir’s leadership. Since taking charge, he has overseen two home Test series defeats, first against New Zealand and now against South Africa, prompting fans to vent their frustration at the former opener.The anger reached a flashpoint after the crushing 408-run defeat in Guwahati, where sections of the crowd began chanting ‘Gambhir Aye Haye’. The situation escalated so rapidly that batting coach Sitanshu Kotak and fast bowler Mohammed Siraj had to step in to pacify the spectators. Adding fuel to the fire, fans continue to debate Gambhir’s equations with Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , and many have even begun speculating about the ODI futures of both senior players.Amid this growing unrest, former India fast bowler Zaheer Khan , who shared the 2011 World Cup dressing room with Gambhir, urged the coach to toughen up and face the criticism calmly.“Emotions run high. When you’ve been winning consistently, expectations rise. Accountability will always follow,” Zaheer told Cricbuzz. He added that the role naturally invites scrutiny and that Gambhir must learn to remain balanced and handle public backlash with resilience.“You’ve got to be thick-skinned to deal with these kinds of criticism. It comes with the passion and expectations surrounding the team,” he said.India’s recent form under Gambhir has not helped his cause. The team lost an ODI series to Sri Lanka last year, followed by a surprise whitewash in New Zealand. Overall, India have lost five of their last seven Tests with Gambhir at the helm.Zaheer further stressed that Gambhir must be more open about his vision, saying that supporters appreciate honesty and clarity regarding selection choices and long-term plans.Gambhir has been criticised for fielding too many all-rounders in the Test XI at the cost of specialists. He also drew sharp reactions for preparing a rank turner in Kolkata against South Africa, despite India previously suffering a 0-3 defeat on similar surfaces in New Zealand.Zaheer suggested that communication is key. “Disappointment comes because everyone knows the team can perform better. It’s a phase, and emotions naturally rise. That’s why the team management needs to engage with fans openly. They understand more than people think,” he said.He concluded by saying that as long as the team sticks to a process aimed at sustainable success, transparency will help ease frustration among supporters. “If the team is clearer and more vocal about its thought process, the fans will understand where they’re coming from. It’s important not to get carried away,” Zaheer added.",Gautam Gambhir has been criticised for fielding too many all-rounders in the Test XI at the cost of specialists.

Still have doubts? Virat Kohli blows World Cup trumpet with another masterclass

Poll Who do you think is primarily responsible for India's decline in Test cricket? Players Team Management Both equally External Factors

NEW DELHi: Former head coach Ravi Shastri has delivered one of his most pointed critiques yet of India's dramatic fall in Test cricket, declaring that both players and the team management must take responsibility for the decline. The former India head coach, who oversaw the team's successful run alongside Virat Kohli, said he is deeply hurt by the sight of a side that once dominated home and away now suffering whitewashes against New Zealand and South Africa at home.Shastri, speaking to Prabhat Khabar in a podcast teaser, was visibly frustrated while recalling India's collapse in the Guwahati Test. “You tell me. What happened in Guwahati – from 100/1, you skip to 130/7? This team is not that bad either. They have this much talent at least. The players should take some responsibility too. You have played spin since you started playing cricket,” he said.Asked whether he was defending new head coach Gautam Gambhir , Shastri was blunt. “I'm not protecting [him]. One hundred per cent he is responsible too. When am I saying anything otherwise?” he said.Then came his most striking comment. “Agar yeh mere saath hota, main pehla responsibility leta (Had this happened with me, I would have been the first one to take responsibility). But then, I wouldn't have spared the players either in the team meeting.”The frustration stems from high standards Shastri's own tenure had set. Between 2017 and 2021, India became the world's best travelling Test side, winning two historic series in Australia, staying No. 1 for 42 months and losing only two matches at home under Kohli.While Rahul Dravid revived the team after a slow start, leading India to home series wins and a second WTC final, that trajectory has stalled under Gambhir. India have managed just two Test series victories in 14 months — against Bangladesh and West Indies — while suffering heavy defeats in Australia and a draw in England.",Ravi Shastri says both players and team management must take responsibility for India's dramatic fall in Test cricket.

For any cricket… the skills are very critical. But more importantly, it is all about mental aspect also. Because it is all about how you perform under pressure Pravin Amre

As the Indian Street Premier League (ISPL) works towards the third season, having conducted trials across 101 cities and conducting simulation trials, the scale of the league’s talent search has reached unprecedented heights.The tennis-ball T10 tournament—set to take place in Surat from January 9 to February 6, 2026, expanded its trials to 101 cities across India, nearly double the footprint from previous season.With more than 4.4 million player registrations this year, ISPL continues its ambitious mission to discover talent from every corner of the country.ISPL Head of Selection Committee Pravin Amre described the response as overwhelming.“We were amazed with the response basically of 44 lakhs applicants. Of that around 60 to 70% was there on the first day. So, more important for us is the interest and I think that drives us,” he said in an interaction with TimesofIndia.com.The decision to take trials directly to players, to smaller cities and towns, rather than expecting them to travel long distances, was a deliberate step toward accessibility.“Sometimes it was really challenging for the talented boys to reach there (big cities).So this year… we decided to make sure a selector can go there and reach there. I must give credit to the 32 selectors because they really travelled very hard all over India. 101 is a lot of cities to cover!,” added Amre.This season’s trials spanned metros like Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai, as well as smaller towns such as Rameswaram, Latur and Satna. Amre himself covered the West and North zones, where match simulations also took place.“Around 250 boys are here right now… around 850 boys are shortlisted. From there we have to get it to the 350… every 650 boys are recorded, their videos are recorded, each and every ball is recorded,” he explained. These detailed recordings will help franchise owners, coaches and selectors evaluate talent before the auction on December 9 , which will feature eight teams.One of the biggest changes Amre has noticed over the past two seasons is the growing importance players place on fitness.“People are giving importance to fitness… we have also introduced a couple of fitness tests (SET Score). So, the boys are also aware that they have to go to the grind where not only the skill but the fitness will also matter,” he said.With ISPL expanding squad sizes to 18 players - including two mandatory U-19 players - physical conditioning has become crucial in the high-intensity T10 format.Amre noted that agility and speed carry significant weight in selection. “When you run also, it's a sprint… that agility also is very critical. Because in this, if you miss a run... like in the IPL, one run matters.”Yet, while fitness is vital, Amre believes mental strength under pressure often separates good players from exceptional ones. “For any cricket… the skills are very critical. But more importantly, it is all about mental aspect also. Because it is all about how you perform under pressure,” he said.During the trials, players were tested through 12-ball challenges that simulate high-pressure match situations. “You may be a good player, but if the execution is not there, it is not going to be useful for the team.”Drawing from his years of scouting experience - including identifying Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant and Prithvi Shaw for the Delhi Capitals in the IPL — Amre said the core principle remains constant. “Bottom line is same… I am justifying a talent, an untapped talent… we back our gut feeling. We see that this boy has good potential.”Amre believes the ISPL platform has already brought about a shift in player mindset. “People used to come just like that… Now, they come more prepared. They do their homework very well. They know like what are expected from the selectors,” he observed. In tense, short-format trials, selectors often look for a single decisive moment. “They have that one good shot… or that one good ball. And I think the selector is looking on that one ability. ”Among the thousands of participants this year, the diversity has been striking. Stories range from an 11-year-old prodigy to a player in his 40s who impressed selectors. Amre sees this as a hallmark of ISPL's inclusivity. “40 and 11, the age is a number… we wanted to make sure like that skill has given a justice rather than the age.”","ISPL trials went to 101 cities across India before the third season begins next year. The tennis-ball T10 tournament is set to take place in Surat from January 9 to February 6, 2026. With more than 4.4 million player registrations this year, ISPL continues its ambitious mission to discover talent from every corner of the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125693293,imgsize-185756,width-400,resizemode-4/pravin-amre-ispl.jpg"

Harshit Rana press conference: On social media trolls, outside noise, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma

NEW DELHI: Indian skipper Rohit Sharma is on the verge of achieving a monumental milestone in international cricket. Ahead of the second ODI against South Africa in Raipur on Wednesday, Rohit stands just 41 runs away from becoming only the fourth Indian to breach the 20,000-run mark in international cricket. If he reaches the landmark, he will join an elite club featuring Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli and Rahul Dravid. Tendulkar tops the chart with 34,357 runs, followed by Kohli with 27,808 and Dravid with 24,064.So far in his international career, Rohit has scored 19,959 runs in 503 matches at an impressive average of 42.46, including 50 centuries and 110 half-centuries. His runs are spread across formats with 4,301 in Tests, 11,427 in ODIs, and 4,231 in T20Is.Rohit has had a solid run in ODIs this year as well, scoring 561 runs in 12 matches at an average of 51.00, with two hundreds and three fifties, including a best of unbeaten 121. Since stepping away from T20Is after the 2024 T20 World Cup and opting out of Test cricket in May, ODI cricket is now his sole active format. After the South Africa series, he is likely to feature in the ODI series against New Zealand at home.His recent form reflects consistency and intent. During the Australia tour last month, Rohit struck a fifty and a hundred in the three-match ODI series.He carried that momentum into the first ODI against South Africa in Ranchi, where he scored a fluent 57 off 51 balls.Rohit also broke a long-standing record during that match, surpassing Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi to become the batter with the most sixes in ODI cricket.Entering the match needing three sixes to go past Afridi’s tally of 351, Rohit reached the milestone in style and now sits at 352 sixes—achieved in just 269 innings, a full 100 fewer than Afridi.","Rohit Sharma is on the verge of achieving a monumental milestone in international cricket. He stands just 41 runs away from becoming only the fourth Indian to breach the 20,000-run mark.

He had also stepped away from T20Is after India won the 2024 World Cup in Barbados.""He has confirmed his availability to play in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. How many games he will feature in, that is not clear yet. Obviously, him being around will be a massive boost to the Delhi dressing room,"" Jaitley was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Delhi will begin their campaign against Andhra in Bengaluru on December 24. They will play six matches in total.Large crowds are expected when Kohli features in domestic cricket.Earlier this year, more than 12,000 spectators attended a Ranji Trophy match when Kohli played his first first-class game in more than 12 years.

India vs South Africa 2nd ODI : Squads

India

South Africa

NEW DELHI: With both teams taking key positives from the series opener in Ranchi, the second ODI between India and South Africa promises another high-octane contest. The three-match ODI series now moves to the Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh International Stadium in Raipur, where the hosts will look to seal the series on Wednesday.The opening clash in Ranchi lived up to expectations, with India edging out South Africa by 17 runs in a thrilling finish. The spotlight once again fell on the experienced duo of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , who stitched a memorable 136-run stand after an early setback. Their partnership laid the foundation for a strong total, much to the delight of a packed stadium.Batting first, India posted a commanding 349/8. Kohli was the star of the innings with a sublime 135 — his 52nd ODI century — while Rohit contributed a fluent 57. KL Rahul also chipped in with a solid 60, and Ravindra Jadeja provided valuable late runs. Despite a mini-collapse triggered by Marco Jansen and Corbin Bosch, India managed to put up a competitive target.South Africa’s chase began on the back foot as Harshit Rana struck twice in two deliveries, removing Ryan Rickelton and Quinton de Kock. Arshdeep Singh then dismissed skipper Aiden Markram to leave the visitors in trouble.The Proteas showed resilience through Matthew Breetzke, Tony de Zorzi, and Dewald Brevis, who built crucial partnerships. However, Kuldeep Yadav’s four-wicket spell proved decisive in breaking South Africa’s rhythm. Jansen’s explosive knock and Bosch’s fifty took the match deep, keeping the contest alive until the final over, but India held their nerves to secure a 1-0 lead.As the attention shifts to Raipur, one key question remains — will weather affect the fixture?The good news for fans is that weather conditions are expected to remain clear. Raipur is forecast to have zero chances of rain, with temperatures ranging between 28°C during the day and dropping to 15°C at night. According to AccuWeather, cloud cover may hover around 39%, but no rainfall is expected. However, the air quality index (AQI) will likely remain in the “poor” category.With ideal playing conditions predicted, fans can expect a full game — and potentially another thrilling showdown.: Rohit Sharma, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Tilak Varma, KL Rahul (c) (wk), Rishabh Pant (wk), Washington Sundar, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Harshit Rana, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Prasidh Krishna, Arshdeep Singh, Dhruv Jurel: Temba Bavuma (captain), Ottneil Baartman, Corbin Bosch, Matthew Breetzke, Dewald Brevis, Nandre Burger, Quinton de Kock, Tony de Zorzi, Rubin Hermann, Keshav Maharaj, Marco Jansen, Aiden Markram, Lungi Ngidi, Ryan Rickelton, Prenelan Subrayen","India beat South Africa by 17 runs in the first ODI in Ranchi.

Still have doubts? Virat Kohli blows World Cup trumpet with another masterclass

NEW DELHI: India heads into the second ODI against South Africa in Raipur on Wednesday with a mix of confidence and questions. Confidence, because Virat Kohli’s imperious 52nd ODI century and Rohit Sharma’s brisk 57 paved the way for a 17-run win in the series opener at Ranchi. Questions, because off the field, whispers about differences with head coach Gautam Gambhir have grown louder.Kohli and Rohit are not just playing to win games—they are also auditioning for the 2027 ODI World Cup, two years away in South Africa. Having set up two consecutive victories for India in last as many ODIs—including a nine-wicket hammering of Australia at Sydney in October—Kohli and Rohit have shown they will do everything possible to be on that flight to the World Cup in South Africa. Both chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar and Gambhir have remained non-committal about their World Cup participation, which seems to be at the centre of simmering tensions.On the field, India’s combination still looks unsettled. Ruturaj Gaikwad, a consistent performer in List A cricket, was moved from opening to No. 4. He didn’t look completely comfortable, while stand-in captain KL Rahul held firm at No. 6. Washington Sundar, who has seen plenty of batting experiments, batted at No.5 and fell during a slow phase for India. He bowled only three overs for 18 runs.Harshit Rana made his mark with two early wickets using the new ball but leaked runs in the latter stage. The ICC’s rule allowing only one ball to be continued from the 34th over adds another layer of challenge for bowlers. Kuldeep Yadav’s variations won India crucial wickets, ending with 4/68, making the difference in a match South Africa nearly stole.Speaking of South Africa, they showed resilience after being reduced to 11/3. Marco Jansen tore into the Indian attack for a 70 off 39 balls, while Matthew Breetzke scored 72 on his first ODI against India. Their tail, led by Corbin Bosch, made India sweat before eventually falling short.The Proteas were without regular skipper Temba Bavuma and Keshav Maharaj, rested after their historic Test series win. Their return is expected in Raipur.Raipur itself is not a well-trodden path for India. In the only ODI previously played here, India dismantled New Zealand for 108 in January 2023 and won by eight wickets. In the only T20I here, against Australia in December 2023, India posted 174/9 and won by 20 runs.","India beat South Africa by 17 runs in the first ODI in Ranchi.

Still have doubts? Virat Kohli blows World Cup trumpet with another masterclass

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma appeared unfazed by the growing chatter around their futures, focusing instead on a demanding net session under the floodlights ahead of India’s second ODI against South Africa on Wednesday.Speculation has intensified over what lies ahead for the senior duo, especially with the road to the ICC ODI World Cup 2027 now part of the discussion.But fresh off back-to-back match-winning performances against Australia and South Africa, neither Kohli nor Rohit showed any signs of easing up during training on Tuesday.Kohli looked sharp and assertive, taking on throw-down experts Raghu (right-arm) and Nuwan Seneviratne (left-arm), who pushed the pace throughout the session. The battle was compelling to watch — Kohli found the middle of the bat repeatedly, though there were moments when Raghu’s extra pace beat him.Head coach Gautam Gambhir stood positioned between the two nets, observing the session closely.When Kohli wrapped up his batting, he rested both bats on his shoulders and walked past Gambhir without exchanging a word — a moment that would not go unnoticed considering the recent narrative surrounding Indian cricket.Rohit, who followed Kohli into the nets and then toward the dressing room shortly after, did pause briefly for a conversation with Gambhir before heading inside.While all eyes naturally gravitated toward the two senior players, training intensity remained high across the nets as India look to clinch the series after taking a 1-0 lead with Sunday's win in Ranchi.With the match to be played on a black-soil surface at the Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh Stadium, the batting group trained with intent, showcasing aggression from the outset.Yashasvi Jaiswal sent multiple deliveries soaring over the leg side boundary, and even rolled his arm over to bowl to Rishabh Pant — the last batter to take his turn in the nets.","Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma train ahead of India's second ODI against South Africa on Wednesday.

Harshit Rana press conference: On social media trolls, outside noise, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma

NEW DELHI: Harshit Rana, who has entered the India setup across formats during Gautam Gambhir ’s tenure as head coach, said he is not affected by claims that he is receiving preferential treatment. The fast bowler said he avoids outside conversations and focuses only on his work on the field, as India prepare for their next ODI in Raipur.Harshit Rana said he does not pay attention to claims that he is getting preference from India head coach Gautam Gambhir, adding that such talk affects performance and he prefers to stay focused on his cricket.Rana, 23, has made his India debut in all formats during Gambhir’s stint, beginning with the Perth Test on last year’s Australia tour. His returns have been mixed so far, but Gambhir has continued to support him.""If I start listening to all these things, put them in my mind and take the field, I won’t be able to play cricket,"" Rana said when asked about criticism, including from social media.""I try to avoid as much as possible. I just pay attention to what I have to do on the ground. I don't care about what is happening outside or what someone is saying about me.I just focus on my hard work and what I am going to do on the ground,"" he said ahead of India’s training session at the Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh Stadium in Raipur.Rana took 3/65 in the first ODI in Ranchi, taking two early wickets before slightly losing control later in South Africa’s chase.He said he is working with bowling coach Morne Morkel and Arshdeep Singh to improve his new-ball skills.""With the new ball I am practicing a lot with Morne (Morkel) and I keep talking to Arshdeep a lot.

Still have doubts? Virat Kohli blows World Cup trumpet with another masterclass

NEW DELHI: Raipur’s Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh International Stadium is buzzing with excitement as fans gear up to witness another masterclass from Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma . Ahead of the second ODI on Wednesday, the star duo gave spectators a glimpse of what could be in store.During India’s net session on Tuesday, Kohli — fresh from a sensational century in the opening ODI at Ranchi — looked in supreme touch. He struck a couple of clean sixes off the bowlers, displaying the same authority that defined his match-winning knock.Rohit, too, was present in the nets and spent time closely observing Kohli from the sidelines, much to the delight of those in attendance.India enter the Raipur clash with a 1-0 lead after a thrilling 17-run victory in Ranchi. The first ODI featured a vintage Rohit-Virat show, reminiscent of their exploits in Sydney, igniting the crowd and setting the tone for the series.The pair stitched a 136-run stand for the second wicket. Rohit scored a fluent 57 off 51 balls, laced with five fours and three sixes — enough to surpass Shahid Afridi’s long-standing record for most sixes in ODIs. The Indian skipper came into the match needing only three to go past Afridi’s tally of 351.Kohli was the standout performer with a brilliant 135 off 120 balls, hammering 11 fours and seven sixes at a strike rate of 112.50.Watch the video here After a promising start from Yashasvi Jaiswal (18 off 16), India stumbled briefly as Rohit, Ruturaj Gaikwad (8) and Washington Sundar (13) were dismissed in quick succession. However, partnerships between Kohli and KL Rahul — who made an impactful 60 off 56 — and later Rahul with Ravindra Jadeja (32 off 20) helped India post a strong 349/8 in 50 overs.South Africa’s chase began on the back foot, with India’s pacers reducing them to 11/3. A steady 66-run stand between Tony de Zorzi (39) and Matthew Breetzke brought them back into the contest. Cameos from Dewald Brevis (37 off 28) kept the pressure on, though half the side was down for 130.A defiant 97-run partnership between Breetzke (72 off 80) and Marco Jansen (80 off 39) suddenly tilted momentum toward the Proteas, but Kuldeep Yadav’s timely strikes swung the game back India’s way.Corbin Bosch (67 off 51) kept the chase alive deep into the innings, but India held their nerve, sealing the match by 17 runs. Young pacer Harshit Rana impressed as well, finishing with 3/65.The win gives India a crucial advantage as they look to clinch the series in Raipur. Fans now await whether the “Ro-Ko show” continues to headline India’s batting brilliance once more.","India enter the Raipur clash with a 1-0 lead after a thrilling 17-run victory in Ranchi.

I’m really excited to play more ODIs as well. When Rohit bhai and Virat bhai are in the same team, the confidence level is completely different. They have so much experience and knowledge, and I try to take as much advice from them as possible to get better.I speak to Virat bhai a lot, especially about fitness and running between the wickets. His intensity is incredible. I love running too, and I feel I’m pretty quick, so I really enjoy that part of the game. If we play together, running between the wickets with him is something I look forward to.”Varma also highlighted Gambhir’s role in helping him stay grounded and competitive.“Gautam sir always gives me confidence. He tells me that if you have the skill, you can play all formats and do well in all formats. He puts me under pressure in practice sessions so I can learn how to handle pressure in matches. He keeps challenging me because he believes I have the capability. That backing means a lot to me.”Looking ahead to the second ODI in Raipur on Wednesday, Varma remains determined to make the most of future chances.“Whatever opportunities I get against South Africa, I want to finish those matches. I want to prove myself in ODIs and Tests too. I’m challenging myself to perform in the longer formats and grow as an individual player.”","India edged past South Africa by 17 runs in a tightly contested first ODI at the JSCA International Stadium Complex, taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.

AHMEDABAD: Even as their seniors have struggled for success of late, the country’s U-17 boys wrote a famous chapter, sealing qualification for the AFC U-17 Asian Cup in Saudi Arabia. The grade came on the dint of inflicting a 2-1 defeat to an old rival, Iran, by defending resolutely and keeping the aggressive visitors at bay for more than 40 minutes to edge the Asian giants in the last of the qualifiers here.Seven minutes into the second half with the game tied 1-1, defender Korou Konthoujam launched a high ball into the opposite half. Iranian defender Amirmahan Afrooziani’s attempt to connect with it failed, and as he fell down, India midfielder Gunleiba Wangkheirakpam, lurking on the left flank, took two touches before unleashing a fierce shot that took the deflection of Mohammad Ali Rahnama before landing in the Iranian goal. The goal sparked wild, delirious celebrations on the Indian bench, and Gunleiba was cautioned for his shirtless celebration.India still needed to keep Iran at bay for more than 40 minutes, and they defended with composure and rare resoluteness. Every ball launched into the Indian box was cleared first time.","India beat Iran 2-1 to qualify for AFC U-17 Asian Cup in Saudi Arabia.

Alexander Isak scored his first Premier League goal for Liverpool, leading to a crucial 2-0 victory against West Ham at the London Stadium on Sunday.The Sweden forward had not scored in five Premier League appearances since his British record £125 million transfer from Newcastle in September.This was only Isak's second goal in 11 matches across all competitions for Liverpool, following his initial score in a League Cup victory against Southampton.Liverpool secured their first win in four games when Cody Gakpo added a second goal during stoppage time.""There's definitely a feeling of relief because if you have lost so many times, then winning is important. We hardly conceded a chance and we were able to create chances ourselves,"" Reds boss Arne Slot said.""It helps if you don't go 1-0 down after five minutes because then you are more open. We played the game I wanted us to play. What I saw meant a lot to our players and our fans. This is a good first step for us. We won and had a clean sheet.""Isak's performance had been affected by injuries and lack of match fitness after missing pre-season due to his extended transfer negotiations.The 26-year-old's goal marked his first league score since playing for Newcastle against Brighton in May, ending a 10-match goalless streak for both club and country.""I think it does feel significant,"" Slot said.Liverpool had faced recent challenges, including a 4-1 defeat against PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League and 3-0 losses to Manchester City and Nottingham Forest.The team had lost nine of their previous 12 games, marking their worst performance since 1953-54, including six defeats in seven league matches.The victory helped Liverpool move to eighth place, providing relief for Slot who faced mounting pressure.Mohamed Salah's performance has been a concern, with only five goals this season, leading to his third bench placement.West Ham honored their former captain and manager Billy Bonds, who passed away at 79, with a minute's applause.Despite West Ham's strong start, Liverpool gradually took control of the match.Isak initially struggled, missing a clear chance from the edge of the area and having a bicycle kick saved by Alphonse Areola.The Swedish striker finally scored after 60 minutes, converting Gakpo's assist with a low shot past Areola.Isak was substituted shortly after scoring, receiving acknowledgment from Slot on the sideline.West Ham's situation worsened when Lucas Paqueta received a red card in the 84th minute for two yellow cards, both for dissent against referee Darren England.The match concluded with Gakpo scoring from 12 yards following a defensive error by West Ham.","Liverpool defeated West Ham 2-0 at the London Stadium on Sunday.

Premier League: Joshua Zirkzee ends goal drought; Manchester United stage comeback to beat Crystal Palace 2-1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/premier-league-joshua-zirkzee-ends-goal-drought-manchester-united-stage-comeback-to-beat-crystal-palace-2-1/articleshow/125674298.cms,"Manchester United players (Jordan Pettitt/PA via AP)

Joshua Zirkzee scored his first Premier League goal in nearly a year, while Mason Mount secured the winning goal as Manchester United defeated Crystal Palace 2-1 on Sunday.Ruben Amorim's team initially fell behind when Jean-Philippe Mateta scored a first-half penalty at Selhurst Park. However, Zirkzee and Mount's second-half goals helped United secure their first victory in four matches.United overcame their slow start with Zirkzee's first Premier League goal since his strike against Everton in December 2024. The Dutch striker had experienced a 24-game goalless streak in the league, raising questions about his £36 million transfer from Bologna in 2024.Zirkzee, aged 24, had not found the net in his previous eight appearances since April. Mount, who has faced injury setbacks since joining from Chelsea, celebrated only his second goal of the season.This victory marked United's first win since October, providing relief for Amorim after their recent loss to 10-man Everton at Old Trafford. The win was particularly significant as it ended Palace's unbeaten home record in the Premier League, which had stood since February 15.""There are no excuses"" for United's struggling start to the season, Amorim had stated earlier in the week.Casemiro nearly gave United an early lead within the first minute when a long throw created confusion in Palace's defense, but Dean Henderson saved his close-range shot.Mateta missed an opportunity at the other end, failing to score after getting past Leny Yoro with only goalkeeper Senne Lammens to beat. Lammens then made saves from Daichi Kamada's low shot and helped defend against Yeremy Pino's attempt.Palace took the lead in the 36th minute through a penalty. Yoro fouled Mateta, who initially scored but had his goal disallowed for a double-touch violation.A new rule implemented this season allows successful penalties with accidental double-touches to be retaken. This rule clarification followed Julian Alvarez's disallowed penalty for Atletico Madrid against Real Madrid last season.Mateta successfully converted his second attempt past Lammens. Zirkzee, who had been quiet in the first half, equalized in the 54th minute with a remarkable shot from a difficult angle after receiving Bruno Fernandes' free-kick.Shortly after scoring, Zirkzee almost contributed to an own goal when he deflected the ball toward his own net, but it was cleared to safety.Mount put United ahead in the 63rd minute, scoring from a free-kick assist by Fernandes. His low shot went under the Palace wall and past Henderson from 20 yards out.",Manchester United defeated Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park.

I feel it’s a good chance. It would be better if we have more Indian overseas players with Indian passport. If he’s available and playing outside, it would be very good. It would definitely improve our performance. In the last game (against Bangladesh) had Ryan Williams been there, we could have performed better,” Jamil remarked.After relinquishing his Australian passport to become an Indian citizen, Williams travelled to Dhaka as a member of Jamil’s squad but could not play because of the delay in getting the mandatory Fifa approval with respect to the change of member association.",Jamil’s stint with the Blue Tigers began with a creditable third-place finish in their maiden CAFA Nations Cup but it turned out to be false dawn earlier than anticipated.

Inter Miami head coach Javier Mascherano showered praise on Lionel Messi , calling him “extraordinary”, after the Argentine icon guided the club into their maiden MLS Cup final with a commanding 5-1 victory over New York City FC on Saturday.Miami’s charge to the championship match was led by a brilliant Tadeo Allende hat-trick, while Mateo Silvetti and Telasco Segovia also found the net in a dominant performance at Fort Lauderdale.Messi, 38, didn’t score on the night, but produced a moment of pure class when he set up Silvetti for Miami’s third goal. That assist came just as New York were closing in on an equaliser and effectively put the contest to bed.Mascherano, who previously shared the pitch with Messi for Barcelona and Argentina, said his star man continues to redefine what is possible.“Leo has spoiled us with the extraordinary,” Mascherano said. “He is unique, someone we won’t see again. Maybe people expected a goal today, but he brought calmness with that third goal. Only he can spot that pass. It basically ended the match.”Miami will now welcome either San Diego FC or the Vancouver Whitecaps, who face off later on Saturday, in next weekend’s MLS Cup final.The team enters the title clash in peak form, having smashed FC Cincinnati 4-0 in the previous round and now dismantling New York with similar ruthlessness.Allende was at the centre of Miami’s attacking storm once again. The 26-year-old struck first in the 14th minute after beating the offside trap, then doubled the lead with an outstanding header shortly after.New York responded through Justin Haak’s headed effort in the 37th minute and almost levelled when Julian Fernandez drew a superb save from Rocco Rios Novo in the 66th minute.That moment proved pivotal. Miami instantly countered, with Rodrigo De Paul and Jordi Alba combining before Messi threaded a perfectly weighted pass to Silvetti, who fired home for 3-1.Segovia made it 4-1 in the 83rd minute, and Allende completed his hat-trick a minute later, setting off huge celebrations.Mascherano credited the squad for turning around a season that once looked in disarray.“The players deserve the praise. They understood the direction we needed to take,” he said. “We grew stronger together and reached this stage with a real sense of unity. Everyone pulls in the same direction, and who starts doesn’t matter. The strength of this group is unshakeable.”",Inter Miami beat New York City FC 5-1 in MLS Eastern Conference final.

Chiefs protect Travis Kelce’s relationship from public spectacle



Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has found not just success on the gridiron but unwavering support off it, thanks to a franchise that respects his personal life. Chiefs President Mark Donovan recently opened up about the behind-the-scenes approach the team took when Kelce’s romance with pop superstar Taylor Swift first became public. From the very start, the organization prioritized discretion, ensuring the relationship was never treated as a marketing opportunity.“Taylor's been amazing to us. It's been nothing but good. She is a phenomenon. She is just a special kind of person,” Donovan told sportscaster Kay Adams on the Up and Adams Show on December 1. He recalled early conversations with Kelce emphasizing respect and privacy, promising that the team would handle the relationship just like any other personal matter within the franchise.“I told Travis, 'Look, we are going to treat you and your relationship with the same respect that we treat any other player or coach's relationship,'” Donovan shared. “It's a relationship. We're not going to monetize it, we're not going to go out there and go crazy.”Donovan explained that despite the media frenzy surrounding Swift’s appearances at games, the Chiefs resisted turning the relationship into a spectacle. Unlike televised broadcasts that often highlight Swift, Arrowhead Stadium never displayed her on the video boards, especially during Kelce’s first season with the public watching closely.“For a couple of years, all those shots you see in the stadium. He scores a touchdown. He makes a catch. It goes to Taylor. Especially the first year. We never showed Taylor on our big boards in our stadium, never,” Donovan said. “It was respectful. We're not going to do that.” He added, “We're not taking advantage of this relationship.”Kelce himself insisted on keeping things focused on the team, even weighing in on the music played during games. “Travis, to his credit, is all about team and he's all about the guys and he's all about being part of a team and not being separate,” Donovan said. “And he said, 'That separates me… When we're playing a game. When we're in that stadium, it's about us. And I want it to be about us.'”The couple confirmed their romance in October 2023, following Swift’s first appearance at one of Kelce’s games, and announced their engagement in August 2025. The Chiefs embraced the announcement with a heartfelt social media post: “Today is a fairytale. Congrats to Travis and Taylor — we’re excited to have you as a permanent member of the Chiefs Kingdom family!”Donovan’s comments reveal a franchise philosophy built on respect and support, proving that while Kelce shines on the field, he has a team that stands firmly behind him in every aspect of his life.Also Read: NFL sparks political buzz by adding another outspoken Trump critic to a star-packed Super Bowl performance lineup",Kansas City Chiefs President Mark Donovan opened up about the team's approach to Travis Kelce's relationship with Taylor Swift.

Brandi Carlile to perform at Super Bowl pre-game, drawing political attention



Conservatives upset over the NFL ’s decision to feature Bad Bunny as next year’s Super Bowl halftime performer may find themselves equally frustrated by another announcement. Brandi Carlile , the acclaimed folk-rock singer-songwriter, will take the stage to perform “America the Beautiful” before the Feb. 8, 2026 game in Santa Clara, California. Her participation adds to a pre-game lineup that includes Coco Jones and Charlie Puth, but Carlile’s outspoken political views make her the most controversial figure among the announced performers.Jon Barker, the NFL’s senior vice president of global event production, emphasized that this year’s lineup celebrates both musical talent and cultural impact. He said the chosen artists “embody the very best of music and culture” and “bring a distinct voice to the moment, helping set the tone for a day that will captivate fans around the world.”Although she doesn’t attract the same media spotlight as Bad Bunny, Carlile has long been clear about her political stance. The LGBTQ+ icon openly criticized the Trump administration years ago, telling NPR affiliate KUOW-FM in 2016, “I am really upset with Trump voters right now. I’m a little concerned as to why they are [Trump supporters], but I am listening.” Her latest album, Returning to Myself, continues in this vein, with the track “Church & State” expressing skepticism toward Christian nationalism through lines like, “And they don’t see what we see, but we believe, we believe that they’re not gonna live forever / Burn tomorrow, never say / They’re here today, then they’re gone forever.Carlile’s activism isn’t just in her music. In 2019, she withdrew from the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit to protest the inclusion of then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, condemning policies that separated families at the border as “merit-based abusers of displaced people” and unfit for a gathering of influential women.News of her Super Bowl appearance has sparked online criticism, much like Bad Bunny’s selection did. For those who want a different experience, Turning Point USA announced it will host an “All American Halftime Show” in October, a MAGA-themed alternative to NBC’s broadcast. Performers haven’t been confirmed, but visitors to the event’s site can vote on what they want to see.By featuring Carlile alongside other major artists, the NFL seems ready to embrace the cultural conversations surrounding the game rather than shy away from them. Her performance is shaping up to be a prelude not just to football, but to the debates and discussions dominating the nation.Also Read: ""I’m going to cry"": Dallas Cowboys cheerleader moved to tears as she addresses cruel body-shaming criticisms","Brandi Carlile to perform at Super Bowl pre-game, drawing political attention.

Former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader Claire Wolford responded to the body-shaming



Former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader Claire Wolford did not stay silent after seeing negative comments about her body following her return to the field during the team’s Thanksgiving game. Instead of letting it weigh her down, she used her voice to confront the issue directly, explaining how much progress she has made in healing her relationship with her body and self-image. She shared that years ago, those comments would have pushed her “into a spiral,” but today, she refuses to allow them to undo her growth. In doing so, she opened the door to a larger conversation about pressures, expectations, and empathy for women in the public eye.She cheered with the Cowboys from 2020 to 2024 and now performs as an All-Star, returning to the field when needed and appearing at pregame events. After two full years away from performing on the turf, she stepped in with confidence. What should have been pure celebration turned emotional when she saw the “negative body shaming” that followed online.In a heartfelt TikTok, Wolford addressed her audience with emotional honesty.“I just really hope people realize not the effect you had on me because I spent years of my life body shaming myself, over exercising, trying to make myself fit a certain mold, ugh, I’m going to cry,” she said. “And I have healed from that and feel so much better about where I’m at with body image and what God says about me.” She then added: “But you never know who are triggering and there are girls who see that and maybe are not the same, maybe bigger than me, smaller than me, whatever, and it causes them to stumble. ”Her words sparked a wave of support from current cheerleaders who called her a “role model” and thanked her for using her platform with courage. Among them was All-Star Elli DiGiovanni, who gave insight into the physical demands of their routines. She said in her own TikTok that she considers herself fit but that “there is nothing harder” than performing to ACDC’s “Thunderstruck.” DiGiovanni emphasized how hard they train, explaining, “Four years of doing it every game, practices, you are dancing at 110% every single time for four minutes straight and finishing with a full kickline and jump split. ”She also shared how heavily the uniform affects self perception, saying, “There is not a time that any one of us puts on that uniform and doesn’t look in the mirror and question ourselves for a second.” Her message echoed Wolford’s heartfelt sentiment. Both women made it clear that while the uniforms sparkle under stadium lights, the personal battles behind them often remain hidden.Also Read: Former ‘First Take’ host Molly Qerim posts rare heartfelt request to help the friend she owes everything","Former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader Claire Wolford responded to the body-shaming that followed her return to the field.

Molly Qerim speaks out for Dr. Kanayama



Molly Qerim’s emotional plea reveals unseen side of the ex-ESPN host and her life-changing friendship (Instagram and Getty Images)

Molly Qerim has never been the type to chase headlines or linger in the spotlight once the cameras stop rolling. After slipping away from the relentless churn of ESPN’s First Take, she didn’t try to keep her name circulating in media circles or stay tethered to sports TV chatter. She chose privacy, almost intentionally fading into the background.What makes her latest message so striking is that it isn’t about a network or her career. It’s about someone who stepped into her life during a period of real vulnerability, someone she credits with restoring her health and hope. When Qerim finally decided to speak, it wasn’t for publicity. It was for loyalty.This week, Qerim took a rare step into view by posting a heartfelt message to defend Dr. Kanayama, the physician she believes saved her quality of life. She wrote, “I don't usually speak out like this. But I feel compelled to today. Dr. Kanayama changed my life. He restored my health and gave me back a quality of life I never thought I'd have again... He is facing possible extradition. This isn't about politics or religion — it's about justice, fairness, and standing up for someone who has dedicated his life to healing others.Her words carry even more weight when considering what she has faced personally. In 2018, Qerim publicly shared her struggle with endometriosis, a painful disorder described by the Cleveland Clinic as a condition where “tissue that is similar to the lining of the uterus to grow in other places where it doesn’t belong.” She didn’t dramatize her experience. She simply lived it, quietly and courageously.For many women living with the same condition, her openness was a comfort. And for Qerim, Dr. Kanayama was a pivotal figure in that journey. Back in March, she expressed deep gratitude toward him, writing, “Dr Kanayama, you are an answer to 12 years of prayer. THANK YOU. You are a miracle in my life, and more miracles to come. 🙏, And for anyone dealing with a health scare right now, please don’t give up…keep advocating for yourself and know you can be fully restored, regardless of what the medical report says. Better days are ahead.Mark 5:34.”The idea that someone who has provided healing, relief and compassion might now face extradition feels unsettling to her, and to many who read her message. Qerim isn’t asking for division or outrage. She is asking for empathy and attention. Whatever comes next for her publicly, it’s clear that this moment isn’t about a return to the spotlight. It’s about standing by someone who once stood by her.Also Read: Who is Nick Bosa’s new girlfriend Ella Ailiff and how did their hard-launch relationship begin?","Molly Qerim took a rare step into view by posting a heartfelt message to defend Dr. Kanayama.

Nick Bosa girlfriend Ella Ailiff steps into the spotlight



San Francisco 49ers fans finally have clarity on something that has fueled weeks of curiosity. There’s no longer any doubt about it: San Francisco 49ers lineman Nick Bosa is taken. The star defender revealed his relationship with model Ella Ailiff in a TikTok video posted on November 30, ending a stretch of online guessing that had tied his name to singer Megan Moroney. The short clip shows Bosa and Ailiff sharing espresso, laughing softly and exchanging a few sweet kisses. It was a quiet rollout, but it instantly captured the internet’s attention.The reveal only grew more interesting because it arrived right after whispers about Bosa and Moroney began to spread. Fans had noticed the country singer at Levi’s Stadium earlier this season, which sparked theories about a budding romance. Moroney put all of that to rest when she told People, “I’m not dating right now at all. I’m too busy.” Her clarity shifted the spotlight back to Bosa, whose injury recovery kept him away from the field and left plenty of room for speculation about his private life.Ailiff had been quietly appearing in Bosa’s recent TikTok posts while his followers tried to figure out who she was.His “coffee journey” series, which started in early November, slowly introduced viewers to a mystery woman who stayed turned away from the camera. Previous videos even showed Bosa hugging and kissing her, though her face never appeared. That changed on Sunday when Ailiff was finally revealed, and fans noticed she is now the only account he follows.Ailiff is a model with a growing online presence, holding more than 140,000 followers and running her own matcha brand, Bella Blue Matcha. Her content often mixes lifestyle moments with product features, which made her appearance in Bosa’s espresso-themed TikToks feel natural. Their hard launch video, captioned “Coffee and football Sunday,” quickly drew more than a million views as fans reacted to the new couple.Ailiff’s arrival in Bosa’s life follows his past relationship with model Jenna Berman, which ended in late 2022. Despite occasional attention on his dating life, Bosa has always preferred staying out of the spotlight. Last season, while preparing for the playoffs, he joked that he has “been a hermit for quite some time.”This time, however, he seems content letting the world in, one cup of coffee at a time.Also Read: Travis Kelce’s mom Donna returns to screens in a charming holiday film while teasing big Google Christmas reveal","Nick Bosa revealed his relationship with model Ella Ailiff in a TikTok video posted on November 30.

Cardi B allegedly paying for Stefon Diggs’ life amid claims he impregnated multiple women while she was pregnant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/cardi-b-allegedly-paying-for-stefon-diggs-life-amid-claims-he-impregnated-multiple-women-while-she-was-pregnant/articleshow/125721205.cms,"Rapper Cardi B and NFL player Stefon Diggs are navigating rumors after their son's birth. Unverified gossip suggests financial imbalance and infidelity. Cardi B, known for her outspoken nature, has remained silent this time. Diggs also maintains a low profile. The couple appears focused on their child, not public speculation.

The allegations collide with Cardi B’s self-awareness and Stefon Diggs’ silent stance

The intense spotlight on Cardi B and Stefon Diggs has only grown brighter since the birth of their son, but instead of public celebration, the couple is confronting swirling rumors that paint a complicated picture behind the scenes. In recent weeks, chatter on blind-item channels has alleged that Cardi B has been supporting Diggs financially, even as online speculation accuses the NFL player of getting multiple women pregnant around the same time as the rapper.None of these claims have been verified, and the couple themselves have avoided engaging publicly this time, a notable contrast from Cardi’s past quick and fiery clap-backs. Yet the conversation online has raised an intriguing cultural question: why do audiences cling so insistently to unverified gossip about high-profile relationships, especially when the people involved maintain a largely united public front?The claims, originating primarily from TikTok’s gossip-fueled ecosystem, suggest a power imbalance in the relationship, casting Cardi B in the role of financial provider. But this narrative clashes sharply with the persona Cardi has consistently presented: outspoken, self-sufficient, and unapologetically assertive.When she previously addressed rumors of relationship trouble, Cardi fired off on X with: “First of all, I don't know who made that up. But f**k, that's you ... That's on you, f**k. That could never be me.....I was a f**king stripper, you had to smell good all the time.""Her candor extended into her appearance on Call Her Daddy, where she rejected degrading speculation about her body, saying: “Like, there's a rumour that my boyfriend dumped me because my BBL stink… I don't know who made the rumours that BBLs stink, but it's like... it doesn't stink.”What feels more grounded than rumor is Cardi’s reflection on emotional recovery after her split from Offset: “I went through a lot of f**king trauma… I had to shed a lot of f**king tears so I could finally be like, 'Yeah, I'm feeling good.'”Meanwhile, Diggs maintains near-total silence on the gossip, instead surfacing only in shared family moments, like photos of their son in a tiny sweater marked “Diggs 8.” Whether the outside noise fades or intensifies, the couple seems committed to presenting one clear priority: their child, not the commentary.Also Read: Jeffree Star exposes Stefon Diggs’ alleged secret DMs, humiliates Cardi B and reignites the toxic Nicki Minaj feud","Cardi B and NFL player Stefon Diggs are navigating rumors after their son's birth.

“I will make sure…”: Erika Kirk aimed to outshine Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's stadium spectacle in tribute to Charlie Kirk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/i-will-make-sure-erika-kirk-aimed-to-outshine-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelces-stadium-spectacle-in-tribute-to-charlie-kirk/articleshow/125720988.cms,"Following Charlie Kirk's assassination, his widow Erika launched a grand public tribute, aiming for a scale rivaling Taylor Swift's Eras Tour. She declared her husband's remembrance would be a global spectacle, asserting his legacy deserved immense prominence and emotional power. This ambition transformed personal loss into a movement of remembrance.

Erika Kirk’s push for a spectacle larger than Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour became a defining moment

In the weeks following Charlie Kirk’s shocking assassination in September 2025, his widow Erika Kirk emerged as a forceful, emotionally charged figure determined to transform grief into a grand public tribute. Speaking boldly and directly, Erika made clear she didn’t want her husband’s remembrance to be small, quiet, or merely ceremonial, she wanted it to rival the most culturally dominating live events in America.Her benchmark? Taylor Swift ’s stadium-filling Eras Tour. Honoring a conservative activist through the scale normally reserved for global entertainment icons was a statement in itself. It revealed both Erika’s ambition and the intensity of her resolve: she was not just mourning privately, she was building a movement of remembrance and loyalty in real time.Just two days after Charlie’s death, Erika instructed her team with a directive that instantly drew headlines and defined her tone moving forward: “I want the Taylor Swift concert to look like nothing compared to this.”She wasn’t simply referencing popularity, she was invoking the image of Swift’s 70,000-fan stadium takeover in Glendale as a symbolic benchmark of cultural magnitude. To Erika, the goal was not merely attendance, it was to assert that Charlie’s legacy deserved equal-if-not-greater prominence, volume, and emotional power.Her public statements following the assassination deepened this theme of unrelenting advocacy. In a striking and grief-fueled declaration, she said: “You have no idea the fire you have ignited within his wife, the cries of this widow will echo around the world like a battle cry.” She went further, promising that Charlie’s mission would grow rather than fade: “No one will ever forget my husband's name. And I will make sure of it. ”While many public figures choose solemn modesty in tragedy, Erika chose momentum and volume. To some, the invocation of Taylor Swift, America’s reigning cultural megastar, symbolized ambition bordering on audacity. To others, it demonstrated conviction and strategic vision: Erika was aligning Charlie’s memory with the scale of America’s most unifying pop-cultural gatherings.Years later, that moment stands as a snapshot of how she transformed personal loss into a public campaign, one measured not just in grief, but in stadium-sized ambition.Also Read: Is Selena Gomez secretly designing an emotional multi-city bachelorette experience for Taylor Swift before her Kelce wedding?","Erika Kirk's push for a spectacle larger than Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour became a defining moment.

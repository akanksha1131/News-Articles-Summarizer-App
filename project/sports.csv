Road to the final for Madison Keys

Milestones to be achieved

Sabalenka is aiming for a historic three-peat at the Australian Open, a feat last accomplished by Hingis from 1997 to 1999. A victory would also give her a fourth Grand Slam title.

If successful, Sabalenka would become the first woman to win three consecutive hard-court Grand Slam titles this century, following Hingis, who won the 1997 Australian Open, the 1997 US Open, and the 1998 Australian Open. Only three women in the Open Era have achieved three consecutive hard-court majors, and Sabalenka could join Graf, Seles, and Hingis in this exclusive club.

On the other hand, Keys is vying to become the first first-time Grand Slam singles champion since Coco Gauff at the 2023 US Open. This would be her second title of the season and her tenth overall.

Having already defeated No. 2 Swiatek, Keys aims to become the first player to beat both the World No. 1 and No. 2 in a Grand Slam since Svetlana Kuznetsova at the 2009 Roland Garros and the first at the Australian Open since Serena Williams in 2005.

NEW DELHI: After a rest day on Thursday, the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 resumed full throttle on Friday. A dramatic Round 6 unfolded, with Indian chess prodigies making their presence felt in both Masters and Challengers sections amid the chilly weather of Wijk aan Zee .Struggling with three early losses in the tournament, Arjun Erigaisi opted for stability against the top-seeded American, Fabiano Caruana . Playing with the white pieces, Erigaisi opened with the King’s Pawn and steered the game into a Berlin Defense. The Indian grandmaster castled early.By the 22nd move, both queens were off the board, setting the stage for a balanced middlegame. Soon after, the players agreed to a draw through threefold repetition with 30 moves.It was Erigaisi’s third draw of the tournament. Caruana, also grappling with form issues, welcomed the result.

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic 's quest for a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title ended prematurely as he retired injured during his Australian Open semi-final against Alexander Zverev on Friday.The 37-year-old Serbian star, who had his upper left leg heavily taped following an injury in the quarter-finals, called it quits after losing a grueling first set 7-6 (7/5).Djokovic's exit from the court was met with a mix of boos and applause from the crowd, as Zverev advanced to his first Melbourne final.This marks the fifth consecutive Grand Slam where Djokovic has failed to secure the title he needs to surpass Margaret Court's record of 24 Grand Slam victories.His last Grand Slam triumph came at the 2023 US Open, raising doubts about his ability to overtake Court's record.The defeat also denied Djokovic his 100th career title, a feat only achieved by Roger Federer (102) in the history of tennis.Zverev will now face either world number one Jannik Sinner or American 21st seed Ben Shelton in Sunday's final.Despite being a two-time Grand Slam runner-up at the 2020 US Open and last year's French Open, this will be Zverev's first appearance in the Australian Open final .Last year, Zverev suffered a heartbreaking defeat to Daniil Medvedev in the semi-finals after holding a 2-0 lead. However, he entered this season with renewed energy, finishing 2024 as world number two and winning more matches than anyone except Sinner, having recovered from a severe ankle injury.Djokovic's fitness was under scrutiny heading into the semi-final, as he required medical attention during his four-set quarter-final victory over Carlos Alcaraz. The Serbian expressed concerns about his physical condition before the match.Despite his renowned ability to recover, Djokovic's movement appeared unhindered initially, as evidenced by a 27-shot rally in his opening service game and his ability to save four break points. Zverev also had his share of missed opportunities, failing to convert break points at crucial moments.The match remained on serve until the tiebreak, after which Djokovic ultimately retired due to his injury.",Novak Djokovic retires injured in Australian Open semi-final against Alexander Zverev.

NEW DELHI: Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has advised the Australian selectors to include young opener Sam Konstas in the playing XI for the upcoming Test series against Sri Lanka in Galle.With Australia having already secured a spot in the ICC World Test Championship final against South Africa, they can approach the Sri Lanka series with a relaxed mindset.Ponting believes that Konstas, who impressed during his debut against India in the Boxing Day Test, should be given an opportunity to gain valuable experience in the challenging Sri Lankan conditions.""I think they will pick Konstas and I think they should pick Konstas. He is the one they have identified, he has hit the ground running here in his first innings as well. He provided a lot of entertainment and a lot of buzz around that whole series (against India),"" Ponting told Sydney Morning Herald .""I think they need to play him, to be honest. It is a hard place to play and a hard place to win. It will be a hard place to bat for all of our guys, but especially some of the younger guys who have not experienced those conditions much in the past. But I think they should pick him, it will be a great learning experience for him.""The 19-year-old showcased positive intent and the ability to unsettle the Indian bowlers, scoring 113 runs in four innings.While Australia is considering shuffling their batting order to accommodate the spin-friendly conditions in Sri Lanka, with Travis Head potentially opening alongside Usman Khawaja , Ponting emphasised the importance of investing in Konstas' Test career.""I would be picking him if I was a selector,"" he added. ""I think the order will stay the same. I think it will be the same with the option they have is maybe playing another spinner. They will have Beau Webster there who will give the seam-up overs, one of the quicks is going to miss out, so Cooper Connolly might find himself in a 7 or 8 batting spot and bowling a few overs as well.""","Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has advised the Australian selectors to include young opener Sam Konstas in the playing XI for the upcoming Test series against Sri Lanka.

MUMBAI: The moment he completed his scintillating, gritty 105-ball century, sweeping Abid Mushtaq for a single, an ecstatic Shardul Thakur seemed to have forgotten that he had been affected by severe cramps which required treatment multiple times on the field.Sprinting towards the Mumbai dressing room/clubhouse, he spread his arms, blew kisses and raised his finger towards the audience, which was wholeheartedly applauding Thakur’s second first-class hundred, which was even acknowledged by Jammu & Kashmir’s 40-year-old captain Paras Dogra as “one of the best he had seen” in domestic cricket .The past 12 months haven’t been an easy ride for Thakur. With the Indian team management looking beyondt he 33-year-old in red-ball cricket, preferring the talented Nitish Kumar Reddy instead, there are questions over his future in international cricket .A slow comeback to the game after an ankle injury which required a surgery and no takers for the Mumbaikar at the IPL auction in Nov last year-it all seemed to suggest that the ‘Palghar Express’ was now chugging to the backpages of Indian cricket.However, like in the case of Mumbai in domestic cricket, you must write off Thakur at your own peril.At the Sharad Pawar Academy at BKC, rescuing Mumbai twice in two days from precarious situations with sizzling performances with the bat against the rampaging Jammu & Kashmir bowlers, Thakur has shown why the acronyms ‘Lord Thakur’ and the ‘Crisis Man of Mumbai ’ suit him so well.Serving a stern reminder to the national selectors about his never-say-die “khadoos” attitude and fighting skills, in a gallant show which saw him battle cramps after he crossed fifty and a hit on the chest from an Umar Nazir bouncer after he reached his hundred, Thakur stroked a glorious century (113 not out, 119b, 17x4), which will be remembered for a long time the way it magically brought Mumbai back into the match from a near-impossible situation.Trailing by 86 runs on Day 2, Mumbai seemed done and dusted and headed for their second consecutive defeat to J&K in almost a decade when they slipped to 86 for five in their second innings, which basically read ‘0 for five.’A 54-run opening stand between India’s Test & ODI captain Rohit Sharma (28, 35b, 2x4, 3x6) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (26, 51b, 4x4) had promised much, but then a stunning collapse saw the defending champions lose six wickets for 47 runs as Hardik Tamore (1), Shivam Dube (0, bagged a king pair), Shreyas Iyer (17, should’ve been adjudged caught behind of Umar Nazir when was on 8 but umpire S Ravi missed a loud edge, protested when he was eventually given out in the same fashion), skipper Ajinkya Rahane (16, was caught brilliantly at mid-off by J&K captain Paras Dogra) and Shams Mulani (4) all fell in a heap.At 101 for seven, Mumbai looked to be heading for an embarrassing defeat inside two days with the visitors’ pacers Auqib Nabi (3-69), Umar Nazir (2-76) and Yudhvir Singh (2-63) again firing on all cylinders.However, in walked Tanush Kotian. Fresh off his maiden India call-up for the final two Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, the off-spinning allrounder served as Thakur’s perfect ‘alliance partner, stroking an unbeaten 58 (119b, 6x4). The duo’s epic, unfinished 173-run partnership in 234 balls for the eighth wicket turned the match on its head, and left the J&K bowlers completely deflated.Incidentally, it was at same venue almost an year back, in the Ranji Trophy semifinal against Tamil Nadu that Thakur (109) and Kotian (89 not out) had pulled off a similarly magnificent rescue act, taking Mumbai from 106 for seven to 378, which paved the way for an innings & 70-run win on that occasion.This too, was a fightback for the ages, and it has now given Mumbai a 188-run lead in the match, with three wickets left in the bag. While it’s not clear if Thakur will be fit enough to bowl in the second innings, Mumbai will bank on seamer Mohit Avasthi, who took five for 52 in the first innings to wrap up J&K for 206, and their spinners Mulani and Kotian to do the job.After he stroked a gritty fifty in challenging conditions on Day One, Thakur wasn’t willing to talk up about his performance.“What can I talk about my quality? Others should talk about it. They should see that if someone has quality, he should be given more chances. I like batting in difficult situations. In easy situations, everyone does well. But how you put up the show in adverse situations matters. I see tough situations as a challenge and always think about how to overcome that challenge...” he had said.Dogra summed up J&K’s plight best: “Hathi nikal gaya, bas poonch reh gayi (the elephant almost went through, but the tail was left).”",Shardul Thakur scores 113 not out in Mumbai's Ranji Trophy win over Jammu & Kashmir. Mumbai had been bowled out for 106 in their second innings on Day 2. Tanush Kotian scored 58 not out to help Mumbai to an innings & 70-run win.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117530217,imgsize-26366,width-400,resizemode-4/117530217.jpg"

'It's all instinctive' - Varun Chakravarthy on his plans for 2nd T20I against England

England suffered a one-sided defeat in the first T20I against India in Kolkata on Friday, and the visiting team's vice-captain believes the smog at the Eden Gardens created additional difficulties in reading spinner Varun Chakravarthy , who took three wickets. However, Brook hopes better conditions in Chennai during the second T20I at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Saturday will take care of that issue.""Chakaravarthy is an exceptionally good bowler. But with the smog the other night (in Kolkata), it was a lot harder to pick (him). Hopefully, the air is a bit clearer here (Chennai) and we can see the ball a bit easier,"" Brook told 'Daily Telegraph'.""Facing spin in T20 cricket is probably the hardest thing in the game, especially because I always get out trying to absolutely smack it,"" he said.Brook made 17 in the first match of the series, before being cleaned up by Chakravarthy.But a couple of seasons ago in the IPL, Brook took the attack to Chakravarthy while he was bowling for Kolkata Knight Riders in their match against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), which saw the England batter hitting a century.He would, thus, hope to put the disappointment of the first T20I behind against a familiar opponent and potentially replicate his earlier success.""I was going to watch it (innings for SRH) on the way in (to Friday's practice session), but my phone wouldn't work, so I'll have a look a little bit later,"" he added.Chakravarthy took crucial wickets of Jos Buttler (68), Brook and Liam Livingstone (0) in India's convincing seven-wicket win.""Maybe I've got to rein in a little bit, but we'll see. I think I do have a method (to tackle spinners). It's just trying to do it consistently and more often. I come in the middle order, so the first few balls I face are usually of spin,"" Brook said.","Harry Brook believes the smog in Kolkata made it difficult to read Varun Chakravarthy.

'It's all instinctive' - Varun Chakravarthy on his plans for 2nd T20I against England

IND vs ENG: Coach and captain gave complete freedom, says Abhishek Sharma

NEW DELHI: India spinner Varun Chakravarthy highlights the leadership qualities of head coach Gautam Gambhir and T20I skipper Suryakumar Yadav , emphasising their ability to shield the players from external pressures and distractions.""GG (Gambhir) and Surya (Kumar Yadav) made sure that there was no external stress on the players. They keep the external noise away,"" Chakravarthy said during the pre-match press conference ahead of the second T20I in Chennai.Playing at Chepauk, his home venue, Chakravarthy is set to feature in his first international match there, and he expressed his delight at the opportunity.""Back to Chennai and the base is very important for me. I see it as a very important day for me. Playing for my country in front of my parents and the home crowd. It is very special for me,"" he said.Chakravarthy compared the standards of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy to the IPL, emphasizing that cricketers should participate more in the domestic tournament to enhance their tactical understanding of the T20 format.He was instrumental in India's seven-wicket victory over England in the first T20I in Kolkata on Wednesday, claiming three crucial wickets.Meanwhile, several prominent players, including India captain Rohit Sharma and dynamic wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, represented their respective domestic sides in the penultimate round of the Ranji Trophy.""The level of domestic cricket is extremely high. I would say almost on par with IPL and the other international matches we play. So, I would suggest everyone to play the Syed Mushtaq Ali because we play on small grounds. It is very challenging,"" Chakravarthy said.""I find it very tough playing SMAT. It has definitely helped me to get better, be more instinctive, be on my toes and think correctly at the right moment,"" he added.The 33-year-old backed his words with action, finishing as the second-highest wicket-taker in this season's Vijay Hazare Trophy with 18 wickets, while also claiming nine wickets in seven matches during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT).He also highlighted the importance of his meticulous preparation before matches to outsmart batters in the T20 format.""The first thing begins with preparation, looking at the batsmen's video and what are their early shots and what shots they are looking to play, and have they added a new shot in their book.""Definitely, I do that research. Based on the pitch, certain shots work and certain shots don't work. Based on that, I have a certain calculation in my mind and work around that,"" he explained.Chakravarthy's approach has paid off handsomely, as he has picked up 20 wickets in nine T20Is since making his comeback for India during the series against Bangladesh in October 2024.Though he had to wait three years to return to the national team, the setback did not deter him, showcasing his resilience and determination.""When I got dropped (in 2021), that gave me a lot of time to work on my mindset and my technique, re-change, and tweak many things about my bowling.""Now, he is determined to make the most of every opportunity to solidify his position as a key spinner in India's T20 setup.""My role is to just be aggressive and be brave and keep bowling at the stumps. That has been my role. There is no added responsibility.","Varun Chakravarthy highlights leadership qualities of head coach Gautam Gambhir and T20I skipper Suryakumar Yadav.

Jammu and Kashmir captain Paras Dogra expressed his frustration with the standard of umpiring during their Ranji Trophy match against the defending champions Mumbai. He hoped that the match officials would be ""a bit more attentive"" in the future.Dogra, a veteran of 140 first-class games who is playing his last season in domestic cricket, lamented that poor umpiring ""has been going on for years now.""On the second day of the match, ICC elite panel discard Sundaram Ravi failed to hear a loud nick off Shreyas Iyer 's edge, which was audible to everyone and later confirmed by replays.He initially declared Mumbai skipper Ajinkya Rahane caught behind, and the batter had already crossed the boundary ropes when he was called back. Ravi deemed Umar Nazir's delivery a no-ball, but this time, no replay was available to confirm his decision.""What to say. This has been going on for years and there's nothing much that we can do about it. Umpires are human after all and can make mistakes. But had they been a bit more attentive, it would have been fun,"" Dogra, a former Himachal Pradesh legend, told reporters after the end of day's play.""But it's part and parcel of the game. That's why they got DRS. It would have been a good experience to have DRS here, but we can't control it since there are 10-15 games happening simultaneously. So, it does not make any difference.Despite struggling at 101 for 7 in their second innings, Mumbai managed to extend their lead to 188 runs by the end of the second day's play, thanks to an unbeaten century (113 not out) by Shardul Thakur Dogra praised Thakur's effort, stating, ""Shardul played really well. The ball stopped moving, so that had an impact. That's when we tried doing something different and tried out bouncers, which did not work. It was one of the best innings (in domestic cricket) that I have seen.""The J&K skipper believes that if the target stays within the 250-run mark, they have a chance to win the match.""You have to be patient. Still the wicket is playing out well, they are 188 runs ahead. We will have to bat well and I am hopeful.

Things in Pakistan cricket have started looking up on the field with former pacer and current senior selector trying to turn things around for the team while doubling up as its interim head coach as well. He believes had tracks in some of the previous home Tests in the season been spin-friendly, Pakistan might have been in the running for a place in the World Test Championship (WTC) final.South Africa and defending champions Australia are the two teams who will contest the WTC final this June, having confirmed their spots in the top two of the WTC 2023-25 points table.""I am surprised by this debate. If we are able to win Test matches at home through our spinners, you say our cricket is regressing and if we win matches through pace bowlers you say our cricket is moving forward,"" Aaqib said while talking to the media on Friday, a day before the second Test against the West Indies in Multan .Following their 2-1 victory against England at home, Pakistan have established a 1-0 advantage in the ongoing Test series against the West Indies. They secured a 127-run win in the first Test, with spinners Abrar Ahmed and Noman Ali dominating the proceedings.""It is not the first time Pakistan has won by preparing spin matches. And definitely we should make spin tracks to take advantage of home conditions. We should have taken such decisions before and we would have been in the race in the ICC World Test Championship cycle,"" Aaqib added.He emphasised the importance of collective success, stating that team victories were paramount regardless of whether the standout performances came from batting or spin-bowling or fast-bowling departments.""We need to become that team again where touring sides know it is not going to be easy in Pakistan, and they will face big challenges. In recent times, we have lost home series because we didn't or couldn't prepare pitches to suit our bowlers.""Additionally, the Pakistan coach recalled their recent South African tour, where they nearly clinched victory in the first Test using an all-pace bowling strategy but fell short of claiming the final two wickets.""We didn't play a spinner there, so it is all about conditions and playing eleven is based on that.""","Former Pakistan fast bowler Aaqib Javed is team's current interim coach and PCB's senior selector.

CHENNAI: Manchester City ’s form has been poor to say the least. With the 4-2 defeat at Paris St Germain in the Champions League , City, also struggling in the Premier League , find themselves in a precarious situation. They have to win their final CL league match to advance to the next round.In the absence of defensive midfielder Rodri, City have lacked control and stability in the middle of the park. Former defensive mid-fielder Paul Lambert, who was a key figure in Borussia Dortmund’s CL triumph in the 1996-97 season, spoke about what Rodri brings to the table.“Losing Rodri was definitely a blow as he plays in a specialised position. Rodri played a massive role in City’s success last season and was rewarded with the Ballon d’Or,” Lambert said on the sideline of the Murugap-pa Youth Academy (MYFA) training on Thursday.Lambert further mentioned that many have been very critical of Guardiola, and he feels that it should not be the case. “In the last seven years or so, City under Pep have been incredible. While City are having a tough time, I do not think anybody can be really too critical.”Lambert had a huge role to play for Dortmund in his short one-year spell. The Scotsman was instrumental in keeping Zinedine Zidane quiet in the CL final against Juventus. After several years, when Zidane met Lambert, he said, “Paul Lambert. Ah, bloody hell”. Such was the influence that Lambert had in the title decider.",Manchester City have been without defensive midfielder Rodri.

A worried Mohammedan SC coach Andrey Chernyshov is standing in the middle of the Salt Lake Stadium practice ground, in deep discussion with club football secretary Dipendu Biswas .Not far, assistant coach Mehrajuddin Wadoo is talking on his cellphone. And inside the dressing room, club officials are busy trying to convince the players to come out the middle for training. In three days’ time, they are scheduled to play Mumbai City FC . But they have to make the journey first.This, in a nutshell, was the Indian Super League debutants’ first home training session on Thursday, eight days after holding Chennaiyin FC 2-2 in the league. Chernyshov’s boys are going through perhaps the best phase in their first season. They may be placed last in the table now but are unbeaten in their past four matches.Off the field, however, they are staring at a crisis, with the players threatening to boycott training reportedly over unpaid wages and forcing the club officials to step in to avoid a potential dressingroom revolt twice in the past 10 days. Ahead of the match against Chennaiyin FC on Jan 15 too, club officials had to coax the players to take the field. At the heart of this apparent player unrest lies a tug-of-war between the club and its investors Bunkerhill and Shrachi Sports over transfer of shares.Gurugram-based Bunkerhill, which invested heavily in the club since 2020 and played akey role in the team’s promotion to the ISL , owns 61% stake in Mohammedan Sporting Club Pvt Ltd. Bunkerhill is supposed to hand over 50% of its shares to Shrachi, which joined the company as an investor in Aug last year.It has been understood that Bunkerhill has sent a notice asking the club to transfer this 61% share (apparently promised as per the agreement) by the end of this month, threatening to suspend further funding otherwise. Shrachi, claiming to be “caught in a crossfire” between the club and Bunkerhill, has also stopped its funding in the company.This financial turmoil has left the players in a limbo — with some players reportedly claiming to have unpaid salary for around three months. Players of the club’s cricket team have also joined the protest, shooting off a hand-written letter to the club president alleging that they didn’t receive any payment for the ongoing season.",Mohammedan SC players threaten to boycott training over unpaid wages.

NEW DELHI: Rishi Kapoor , the first Delhi footballer to win a national football league title, passed away in a city hospital on Monday. He was 49 and had reportedly been suffering from liver-related issues.Primarily a left-footed midfielder with fine passing ability and a thunderous shot, Kapoor spearheaded Hindustan FC ’s rise in Delhi’s football of the late 1990s and early 2000s, his ability and time on the ball was good enough to catch the attention of the big clubs in the then National Football League and later, the I-League .At a time when the Capital’s footballers were mostly semi-professional and rare on the national clubs’ scene, Rishi left to join ITI in Bangalore in 2000 with ambitions to play in the NFL. Already employed with Delhi Audit , and with ITI. He was one of the first players to be signed on contract by the Bangalore outfit as it rejigged its rules to allow for two outstation players, or ‘guest players’ as they were officially labelled.It was here that a tweak was made to his positional nature that would immediately further his prospects as a footballer. Partly due to a crowded midfield at ITI, and largely due to his left-footed passing and fondness for playing from the deep, Rishi was converted into a defender at left-back. It may have stifled a bit of his creativity, but his game-reading lent solidity to the defence. His performances at ITI led to Mohun Bagan taking notice.“We’ve lost a very good player today. This is no time to go,” Debjit Ghosh, teammate when Bagan won the title in 2002, told TOI from Kolkata. “When we first saw him at ITI, he was playing as left-back and he really impressed our coach, Subrata Bhattacharya. Much later after we signed him, we realized that he was a natural playmaker, but we needed him in defence. He and I struck up a very fine understanding on the field,” said the ex-India player.Former India international Renedy Singh too recalled their days together at Bagan. “Back then, it was normal that the clubs would never pay us on time. We would seldom have money, but we loved the local kebabs. I remember Rishi, Lolendra (Singh) and me literally scrounging money from here and there just to go Eliot Road and have kebabs,” said Renedy, “He was a very forthright person, probably that may have rubbed some people the wrong way but I remember him very, very fondly.”Despite a national title and the promise of further professional exposure, Rishi left Bagan to return to Delhi’s Hindustan. “He stayed just a few seasons with us. He wanted to return to keep his job,” remembered Ghosh. It was perhaps this mindset – of saving the job -- that probably cost the Delhi footballer an India call-up. Stephen Constantine, the then India coach, was impressed by Kapoor’s versatility on the left channel, but chose to ignore him because he rightly felt that Delhi’s football didn’t offer a high level of intensity and competitiveness.With his job safe, Kapoor enjoyed brief stints with Salgaocar and Sesa in Goa but always returned to establish himself as an Ambedkar Stadium fixture. A decade later, after his first move, as Delhi football would change character, moving away from the Walled City into the suburbs, Rishi Kapoor would be the symbol of change. Playing for newly-formed Delhi United, he would toy with much-younger footballers, effortlessly doing it even at 35.","Rishi Kapoor, the first Delhi footballer to win a national football league title, passed away in a city hospital on Monday.

The Times of India in Melbourne:

After two-hours and 36-minutes in the middle – breaking down Ben Shelton 's incendiary play while battling cramps in the third set -- world No.1 Jannik Sinner turned to his team when the American's backhand found the bottom of the net at match point. Sinner grit his teeth and clenched his fist. It was that kind of a performance.The world No.1 came through the Australian Open semi-final 7-6 (2), 6-2, 6-2, making his second successive final here, in a match in which Shelton's level rode the roller-coaster, the 22-year-old had 55 unforced errors which shouldn't sum the match for him, but it does.The first set hit dizzying heights, just as well that the roof on Rod Laver Arena was open.The left-handed Shelton stepped up to the plate superbly, matching the world No.1 shot for shot, meeting flat with flatter, spin with slice and pace with power, for 71-minutes and 94 points it was hard to pick the world No.1 and the 20th ranked player apart.The 22-year-old American broke early for a 2-0 lead, but the defending champion hit back and levelled at 2-2 even though he looked anything but settled on the court. It was Shelton then who broke in the 11th game and looked set to wrap up the set in the following game with two set points on his serve, but Sinner broke and took hold of the tie-break and the match.Then when the top seed jumped out to a 4-0 lead in the second set, it showed that Shelton of the sparkling talent was still relatively new in the pro game, given that he took a flight out of the United States for the first time two years ago when he made the quarterfinals here on his tournament debut.Shelton, who had the trainer work on his quads at the end of the second set, had the crowd on his side. From 'let's go, Benny let's go', to shouts of 'Come on Shelton make America great again', there was fair support for the world No.1 too, with shouts of 'Come on Janeeeek!' lending to the carnival atmosphere.Shelton had chances to break the Sinner serve in the second and fourth games of the third sets, but it was the Italian, battling cramps, who broke in the fifth game. At the change of ends, Sinner got his hamstring attended to by the physio. Sinner, clearly struggling with movement, decided to swing at everything and broke at love, before serving out the match.""It was a very tough first set, but crucial,"" Sinner said. ""He wasn't serving at his best, not where he wanted to. We both returned better than we served. The first set was tense and I'm happy how I handled it.""Sinner's coach Aussie Darren Cahill is retiring as coach at the end of this year, and the Italian said it was great for him to be back in the final at Melbourne Park again.""There was a lot of tension today, I was slightly cramping. He was suffering on his legs too so I tried to move him around,"" said Sinner. ""These matches can go long. Playing three sets for two-and-a-half hours is a long time, I'm happy to finish it in three.""Sunday's final will see Sinner, the top seed, take on the No.2 seed German Alexander Zverev , who is also in his third Grand Slam final.Sinner said: ""We've had some very tough matches in the past, so anything can happen. He's an incredible player, looking for a first major.

The Times of India in Melbourne

: Aryna Sabalenka is a towering personality with a ginormous game.The Belarusian’s USP is her ability to play high-voltage tennis at all times -- when ahead, trailing or even when struggling to get on the scoreboard. Sabalenka goes with instinct most times, but her game isn’t without tactics. The forehand crosscourt, used to draw opponents wide, has given an edge to her returns, and has been perfected over the last 12 months. Not enough is said about the Belarusian’s footwork, almost flawless, getting her into position to play her shots every time.The 26-year-old’s play is so big, American Madison Keys will look to top that in the Australian Open final on Saturday, where Sabalenka will be going for a three-peat.The top-seed and defending champion thought it was just ‘crazy’ that she had put herself in a position to win three successive Australian Open titles and fix her name alongside legends of the sport, including Swiss Martina Hingis, who is the last woman to achieve that feat - 1997 to 1999.It’s no surprise that Sabalenka, the Minsk-born, Miami resident, called Australia and Melbourne Park in particular, ‘home’.“I feel good here, I feel the support, this year even more. I feel like I'm coming to my home slam,” the world No.1 said. “I know everything, I know every area, I know where to warm up so it's not that crowded. I go (out) there and I feel people screaming my name, they support me. I have goosebumps every time they scream, ‘Let's go, Aryna’.”Keys, 29, seeded 19, playing her first final at Melbourne Park, and her second Grand Slam career final, applauded Sabalenka’s mentality.“She plays such fearless tennis, I think it's very unique,” Keys said. “A lot of people, if it was a tight point, you expect them to play a bit more conservative or back down a little bit, but you know she's not going to do that. It is not only impressive on her side it (also) puts pressure on her opponents -- you know you're always going to have to try to win the point because she's never going to just play passive and give you an easy point.”So supreme is Sabalenka in playing big that in her nine-hours and 12-minutes on court, in her run into the final, she has 132 unforced errors, while Keys who has two-hours and six-minutes more of court time has 202 unforced errors.Keys’ 193 kmph serve, which she clocked in the first round against Ann Li, is the second fastest in the women’s draw here, and her 28 aces also puts the American in second position, behind compatriot Coco Gauff in both columns. Keys’ average speed on her first serve is 170 kmph for the tournament, higher than Sabalenka’s 161. The Belarusian’s average speed on her second serve, however, is 134.2, higher than Keys’ 124.3.The 29-year-old, whose second serve has greater purchase, enjoys a better ratio of breakpoints saved, having saved 26 of 44 (59 percent), while Sabalenka is 18 of 34 (53 percent).Keys said Sabalenka was a reference point for her, given their similar styles of play.“The one thing I really wanted to try to be better at was not playing more passive in big points and trying to emulate the way she trusts her game and the way she goes after it,” the American underlined. “If you're able to do that and you miss and you lose, it's on your terms, it's a little bit easier to swallow.”The theme of the first Grand Slam final of 2025 is bigger and freer tennis. Watch out for the winners.",Aryna Sabalenka will play Madison Keys in the Australian Open final on Saturday. The world No.1 will be going for a three-peat at Melbourne Park. The 26-year-old Belarusian has won the tournament three times in a row.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117515864,imgsize-28986,width-400,resizemode-4/117515864.jpg"

The Times of India in Melbourne:

Keys unlocks Swiatek

There was a moment early in the second set of the Australian Open semi-finals when Paula Badosa appeared to roll over her right leg, going down in a heap on the court. World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka , who was on a run, stopped and looked across the net before advancing in that direction. An uncomfortable hush descended on Rod Laver Arena .Badosa's injury timeline is well documented, her determined fight and gutsy comeback is a part of tennis folklore. But just when it looked like trouble, Badosa signalled to her friend with a thumbs up. Sabalenka couldn't help the smile, it spelt relief and affection.That was the first and only time in the match that the duo, who call themselves 'soulmates', shared shades of their friendship on the court.After Badosa got back on her feet, it was business as usual. Some 25-minutes later the 26-year-old Belarusian closed out a 6-4, 6-2 win which put the two-time defending champion at Melbourne Park within one match of completing a rare three-peat here.On Saturday, Sabalenka bidding to become the first woman to win three Australian Open titles in a row since Martina Hingis (1997 to 1999) will play another heavy striker of the ball Madison Keys , who is back in a major final nearly eight years after making her first final at her home Slam in new York.When the two players entered the mighty Arena for the first of the women's semi-finals on a cold, windy evening, the roof half-closed, there was barely any eye-contact between. The Spaniard was engaged in shadow drills, the Belarusian jumped lightly, shifting from side-to-side before the coin toss and when they posed for the customary pre-match photo, there wasn't even a hint of recognition.They might shop together, go out together and make dance reels together, but they also compete as hard as ever, standing across the net.It was the Spaniard who shot ahead quickly -- 2-0, 40-0, but the World No.1 whose grunt is loud, and follows the trajectory of the ball, turned it around, winning six of the next eight games to power ahead.Sabalenka, who by her own admission, 'played an incredible match', clocked 32 winners.""She wants it badly, we both want it badly. It's our dream, but here we are opponents,"" Sabalenka said. ""No matter what happens on the court, we'll be friends after our matches. It's tough to do, but we agreed on that.""After the two players left Rod Laver Arena, Sabalenka found Badosa seated on the floor in the player area and she crouched down beside her.The 27-year-old Spaniard said: ""She told me she played three semi-finals before she won a title. She was very proud of my improvement, especially with all I've been through. Look, if I have to lose against somebody, of course I want to lose against the World No. 1, against Aryna.""The 29-year-old Keys took the cracker of a second semi-final against World No.2 Iga Swiatek , fighting off a match point to clinch the roller-coaster affair 5-7, 6-1, 7-6 (8) in 2-hours and 35 minutes.After trading serves for the first two sets, Swiatek and Keys held on to their serves for the first nine games of the deciding set.With the 23-year-old Swiatek serving to stay in the match in the tenth game, Keys, the 19th seed, was in all-out attack mode, but the Pole levelled scores and in the following game shot ahead to 0-40. She then converted on her third breakpoint, drilling a winner. Keys swung hard, coming out strong when the Pole had match point and Swiatek finally double faulted at breakpoint.In the match tie-break, Swiatek was ahead for the better part, but Keys was never out of the contest and raised her level to cross the line.""I'm in the final woo hoo!"" Keys said. ""The match was such a high level, Even though I lost the first set I had momentum going into the second, the third set was up-and-down and we had a 10-point match tie-break to make it extra dramatic. We were pushing each other -- who can get the final point and who can be better, I'm happy it's me.""","Aryna Sabalenka beats Paula Badosa 6-4, 6-2 to reach Australian Open final.

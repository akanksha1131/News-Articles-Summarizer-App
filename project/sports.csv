'It's a special place': Sam Hain reflects on Newlands debut in SA20

The Joburg Super Kings (JSK) spin trio of Tabraiz Shamsi , Donovan Ferreira, and Imran Tahir delivered a commanding performance to secure a 28-run victory over Durban's Super Giants in their SA20 clash at Kingsmead on Tuesday. Their combined effort dismantled the hosts' batting lineup, propelling JSK to their second consecutive win of the third season.Chasing JSK's total of 169/7, the Super Giants faltered despite Quinton de Kock 's valiant knock of 55 off 45 balls. De Kock held one end steady with five boundaries and two sixes, but wickets tumbled around him. Shamsi, Ferreira, and Tahir shared five wickets, ensuring the home side fell short, bowled out for 141 in 18 overs.The match saw a moment of brilliance from the 45-year-old Tahir, who dived spectacularly at point to catch Wiaan Mulder off a reverse sweep. The catch galvanised the visitors, who turned the tide decisively.The Super Giants were well-placed at 99/4, with De Kock and Heinrich Klaasen threatening to take the game away. Klaasen, striking a quick 29 off 17 balls, looked dangerous until Matheesha Pathirana dismissed him with a leg-side catch at the end of the 12th over. From there, the collapse was swift, with JSK's spinners tightening the noose.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy Earlier, the Super Kings set a competitive total, thanks to contributions from Leus du Plooy (38), Jonny Bairstow (26), and Ferreira (26). Gerald Coetzee provided late fireworks, smashing the final two balls of the innings for six to ensure JSK carried momentum into the second innings.Despite the defeat, Quinton de Kock was named Player of the Match for his gritty innings. “As the innings progressed, it got harder. To be honest, I thought I won't be able to do it. I have done it on much flatter wickets. It became impossible to hit,"" De Kock reflected.Super Giants captain Keshav Maharaj acknowledged areas for improvement. “We got the balls in the right areas. If I am hyper-critical, we left 15 runs there. It happens in T20 cricket. Naveen is a champion bowler. We can be better in certain periods. The character needs to come through, but there were glimpses of positives,"" he said.JSK skipper Faf du Plessis expressed satisfaction with the team's performance. “Last year, the wicket was spin-heavy. It looked like a dry surface. I was surprised it was sticky - maybe because of the moisture. We thought 160 would keep us in the game. Those two sixes from Gerald at the end were huge. Donovan was hard to hit, and the spinners picked up wickets. Very happy to come here and win. To top the table is a great result for us,"" he said.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 Fixtures The Super Kings will look to maintain their form, while the Super Giants must regroup and address their middle-order struggles.","Joburg Super Kings beat Durban's Super Giants by 28 runs at Kingsmead.

119/9 in 20 overs (James Vince 76, Aayan Afzal Khan 15, Lockie Ferguson 3 for 22, Mohammad Amir 2 for 23) Desert Vipers: 121/4 in 17.4 overs (Sam Curran 42 not out, Sherfane Rutherford 40 not out, Mark Adair 2 for 12, Tymal Mills 1 for 23)

Desert Vipers clinched their second consecutive victory in the ILT20 Season 3 , defeating the Gulf Giants by six wickets at the Dubai International Stadium on Tuesday.An unbeaten 42 from all-rounder Sam Curran , coupled with Sherfane Rutherford’s explosive 40 off 18 balls, ensured a comfortable chase for the Vipers, who reached their target of 120 in 17.4 overs.Gulf Giants, after being put into bat, struggled against the Vipers' formidable bowling attack. Skipper Lockie Ferguson led the charge, taking three wickets, while Mohammad Amir picked up two, restricting the Giants to 119/9 in their 20 overs. James Vince was the lone warrior for the Giants, scoring an unbeaten 76 off 62 balls, while the rest of the batting lineup faltered.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 The Vipers' chase began shakily, with Mark Adair removing Fakhar Zaman and Dan Lawrence in the second over. However, a steady partnership between Sam Curran and Alex Hales, who added 49 runs, stabilised the innings. Hales departed for 20 off 30 balls, but Curran continued to anchor the chase, finding the boundaries at crucial moments.Sherfane Rutherford joined Curran in the middle and launched a blistering assault, smashing two sixes and a four in the 18th over to seal the win. Curran finished unbeaten on 42 from 43 balls, including four fours and a six, earning him the Player of the Match award.Earlier, Gulf Giants struggled to build momentum after losing early wickets. Amir struck in the first over, trapping Adam Lyth lbw, while Ferguson and Curran added to the Giants’ woes by dismissing Rehan Khan and Jordan Cox.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 Schedule Despite Vince’s measured innings, the Giants found little support from the lower order. UAE’s Aayan Afzal Khan provided a brief respite with a 33-run stand, but his dismissal by Luke Wood in the 15th over ended any hopes of a substantial total. Vince fought valiantly, bringing up a half-century off 47 balls and adding a few late boundaries to push the Giants to 119/9.Reflecting on his performance, Sam Curran said, ""It is nice to be here for the start of the tournament and it is nice to win on a tricky pitch. It was almost a bit of a Test match out there, trying to trust your defence. I knew they are going to go for their best seam bowlers at the top, so had to adjust accordingly.""Gulf Giants skipper James Vince acknowledged the challenging conditions. ""It was a tough gig batting first, there seemed to be a bit more moisture in the wicket than the last game. 120 is always going to be tough to defend. We needed a bit of luck going our way on a wicket like that. If we had held onto our chances, it could have been a bit tricky for them,"" he said.Desert Vipers now stand as strong contenders in the competition, with their bowlers and middle order proving decisive in back-to-back victories.","Desert Vipers beat Gulf Giants by six wickets in ILT20 Season 3.

recalls the 1978 tour in new memoir

Poll Which India-Pakistan Player Duel Defined the Rivalry? Virat Kohli vs Mohammad Amir Sachin Tendulkar vs. Shoaib Akhtar

NEW DELHI: Indian cricketers received a tumultuous welcome when they arrived in Pakistan for a Test series in 1978. But the players were taken aback when a foreign-educated Pakistani cricketer referred to them as ""kafirs"", a pejorative term for those who don't adhere to Islam.""An unnecessary remark by a Cambridge-educated cricketer gave us a bit of a shock,"" writes Mohinder Amarnath in his newly-released memoirs, Fearless, penned with brother Rajender. The player who made the remark is not named.The incident occurred after a game in Rawalpindi. ""After the match, we were a bit casual boarding the bus. Gratuitously, this cricketer said, ""Bithao, bithao, in kafiron ko jaldi bithao (Board these nonbelievers quickly),"" writes Amarnath, further adding, ""What was the use of a good education if it could not change their negative attitude towards others?""Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 In contrast, the cricketers received a wildly joyous reception at the Karachi airport. About 40,000-50,000 turned up to welcome the visiting team. The crowd was double the number, but many had left beforehand because the flight was delayed.""The distance from the airport to the hotel normally took 20 minutes, but for us, it took four hours; people had occupied every inch of space on the pavement and the road, and they refused to leave unless and until they caught a glimpse of the Indian cricketers or shaken hands with us. They were warm and hospitable,"" says Amarnath, who played 69 Tests, scored 4,378 runs, hit 11 tons, took 32 wickets, was also Man of the Match in India's 1983 ODI World Cup final triumph.However, some Pakistani players behaved differently. The memoir says, ""… this artificial bubble burst quicker than anticipated and hostility emerged from an expected quarter. Apparently, certain Pakistani players acted on the advice of seniors and kept their distance. If we spoke to them, their tone and tenor was aggressive. At least two of them, Javed Miandad and Sarfraz Nawaz , and to a lesser degree Mudassar Nazar, took the advice a little too seriously. I don't think either Javed or Sarfraz ever kept quiet on the field.""Also See: Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 The cricketer, known to be one of the finest players of pace bowling, recalls an incident in the Karachi Test involving Nawaz and Sunil Gavaskar , who hit centuries in both innings (111 and 137) in the game.""Whenever he bowled a bouncer, Gavaskar allowed it to sail over his head. When the same bowler pitched the ball up to him, it was dispatched to the fence. This annoyed Sarfraz and he vented his frustration in crass Punjabi words, which Gavaskar couldn't understand. After the over, he came to me and asked, ""Why is Sarfraz calling me pant coat?' I laughed at his ignorance and whispered, ""He meant p…c…!"" Those who still cannot follow should recall the 'Ben Stokes' memes on social media.In the late 1970s, exceptions aside, alcohol was banned in Pakistan. Fateh Singh Rao Gaekwad, who was the manager of the team, hosted the players at his Bombay residence before the tour and, ""on a lighter note"" asked the players ""fond of drinks"" to carry their quota.""Many were taken aback by the suggestion, knowing the restrictions on alcohol in Pakistan. The next morning, crates of two-litre Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky arrived and was distributed among the players,"" the memoir says.","Mohinder Amarnath recalls 1978 tour of Pakistan in new memoir Fearless.

NEW DELHI: Who will be India's next Test captain? It's a question that will keep buzzing in the BCCI corridors over the next few months, until the selectors huddle up sometime, maybe, in May to pick the team for the England tour in June. Until then, the debate could linger.For many, the obvious choice is Jasprit Bumrah; but throw in the question of his workload management, and some of the ifs and buts start appearing. In Rohit Sharma 's case, the jury is out, while the skipper himself seems to be on the edge of retirement. In fact, Timesofindia.com learned that he was ready to bow out after the fourth Test on the recently-concluded tour of Australia, but his ""well-wishers"" persuaded him to hang in for now.There have been discussions in corners about India moving on to its next-generation players as leaders, with Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill the two possible names. But their less-than-flattering show in Australia hasn't done their chances any good.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 Will the BCCI go back to Virat Kohli and ask him to look after the team and groom the next captain, possibly with Rohit still around as part of the leadership group? The answer to that is under lock and key at the moment.Sharing his two cents on India's Test captaincy issue, former England spinner Monty Panesar feels that performances in the Champions Trophy and the Indian Premier League (IPL) over the next 3-4 months will settle that debate.The Champions Trophy runs from February 19 to March 9 , with the IPL beginning a couple of weeks after, followed by the tour of England.""Bumrah, I think, would want to lead in England because of the seaming conditions,"" said Panesar, talking to Timesofindia.com from London.Bumrah was named Player of the Series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for his 32 wickets, but he suffered a back injury during the fifth Test. It has also created uncertainty over his Champions Trophy participation.""It just depends on the selectors and also speaking to Bumrah about 'how did you feel about captaincy? Did it get the best out of you? Do you feel it's the best for the team? Is the team listening?'"" Panesar said.""The question is, is Bumrah the best captain for India when it comes to making it into a winning side? Or do they just say, 'maybe we need a batting captain?'""The former left-arm spinner, who has his family roots in Punjab and played 50 Tests for England, said it's difficult to look beyond Pant and Gill if it comes to picking a new captain -- in case Rohit and Virat leave the scene or both remain available for the England tour but decide to stay away from captaincy.Kohli stepped down as the Test captain in 2022, while Rohit 'stepped away' from the fifth Test in Australia, allowing Gill to take his place in the playing eleven.Rohit scored a mere 31 runs in five innings of BGT. He has also lost five of his last six Tests as captain, drawing the one in Brisbane.""When it comes to that (picking a young player as Test captain), you're looking more towards Gill, really. But does he have the experience? Is he going to have a good IPL? And if he does show that for Gujarat Titans, you may just say, 'hang on a minute, this is a good time to do it.' But then overseas tours, you know, it's a big risk,"" Panesar viewed.""You don't see many teams having a fresh captain for an away tour. They always go for an experienced campaigner, and they may just think, 'you know what, let's just go with Bumrah or Rohit...let's not put the pressure of captaincy on Pant or Gill because they still need to show that they can do well throughout a whole series, not in patches.""Rohit is expected to lead India in the Champions Trophy. In fact, the former secretary of the BCCI, Jay Shah, had announced long before that Rohit will lead India in the tournament. However, things have changed since, as his bat has gone silent in red-ball cricket, putting him under self-doubt.India are reported to have sought an extension from the International Cricket Council (ICC) for announcing their Champions Trophy squad. The deadline for that was January 12. It has further raised doubts over the situation with Rohit and the team's captain in the prestigious ODI tournament, which is making a return to the ICC calendar.""Let's say if India win the Champions Trophy (with Rohit as captain), then I just think India will lean towards (sticking with) Rohit as the captain,"" said Panesar.But that's if Rohit wants to continue his international career.To conclude his views, Panesar said winning can change a lot of things.""It's about winning. India needs to get back to winning ways. When you're winning, then it's a lot easier to make decisions. When you're losing, then what you have to do is have a fresh start. You have to bring in, maybe, new players or get the experienced players to groom the next young captain coming through. I think India needs to get back to winning ways, and the sooner they do, it would take a lot of pressure off a lot of other issues.""","Jasprit Bumrah is the obvious choice to be India's next Test captain. The jury is out on Rohit Sharma, who has lost five of his last six Tests as captain. Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill are the two possible names.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117220514,imgsize-32954,width-400,resizemode-4/117220514.jpg"

Liverpool 's charge towards the Premier League title was halted by stubborn Nottingham Forest in a 1-1 draw between the top two on Tuesday as Manchester City 's resurgence came undone in a 2-2 draw at Brentford.Chris Wood fired Forest in front early on at a raucous City Ground, but Liverpool dominated almost the entire 97 minutes and got back on level terms thanks to substitute Diogo Jota's goal with his first touch.Only a brilliant goalkeeping performance from Matz Sels denied the leaders victory, but the point maintained a six-point cushion over Forest for Arne Slot's men, who also have a game in hand.Forest had won their last seven games in all competitions to raise the possibility of matching Leicester's incredible title win of 2015/16.The in-form Wood had the home fans believing after just eight minutes when he slotted in Anthony Elanga's pass.Liverpool enjoyed over 70 percent possession and had 23 shots on goal but only posed a serious threat in front of goal after the break.Jota had only been on the field a matter of seconds when he nodded in Kostas Tsimikas' corner.Sels then made incredible saves to deny Jota, Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo a winner, while Salah also had a goalbound effort cleared off the line.""I could not have asked for more,"" said Slot. ""Second half was outstanding.""There are not many teams that can create so many chances against an opponent so defensively strong. Unfortunately we couldn't get a second.""Liverpool's second consecutive league draw opens the door for Arsenal to cut the gap at the top to four points when they host Tottenham in the north London derby on Wednesday.Any suggestion City could get themselves back in the title race was ended in a late collapse in west London as Brentford struck twice in the final 10 minutes for a deserved point.Phil Foden's double had City on course for a fourth consecutive win after a run of just one victory in 13 games.However, the English champions' defending was not convincing all night and they were punished as Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard netted for the Bees.Foden's return to the form that saw him crowned Premier League player of the year last season was the one positive for City.But Pep Guardiola will reflect on a missed opportunity to make up ground on the top four as City remain down in sixth, 12 points off the top.Foden produced a brilliant deft touch from Kevin De Bruyne's inviting delivery and then smashed in a rebound for his fourth goal in five league games.Brentford wasted a host of chances before conceding but finally got some reward for their attacking endeavour when Wissa slotted in from Mads Roerslev's cross to become the club's all-time leading goalscorer in the Premier League.They completed the comeback in stoppage time when Norgaard's header had too much power for Stefan Ortega.""We are not (at our best) and we didn't take the right decisions,"" said Guardiola. ""It's fine, it's not a good place to come. Unfortunately, we couldn't win.""Fourth-placed Chelsea's miserable run extended to five league games without a win but they were grateful for captain Reece James' stoppage-time equaliser salvaging a point in a 2-2 draw at home to Bournemouth.Cole Palmer's cool finish from Nicolas Jackson's through ball had given Chelsea the perfect start.But Bournemouth hit back through Justin Kluivert's penalty, before Antoine Semenyo's blistering near-post effort put the visitors in front.James has endured another injury-hit season but showed his quality by curling home a free-kick at the death.West Ham boss Graham Potter enjoyed a winning home debut as Fulham were beaten 3-2 at the London Stadium.Carlos Soler, Tomas Soucek and Lucas Paqueta were on target for the Hammers to take Potter's men above Manchester United and Tottenham into 12th.",Liverpool held to 1-1 draw by Nottingham Forest at the City Ground. Manchester City held 2-2 by Brentford at the Macron Stadium. Chelsea held to a draw by Bournemouth at Stamford Bridge.

We take the learnings and move forward: Durban's Super Giants' Prenelan Subrayen

Imran Tahir reflects on JSK's commanding victory over Durban in SA20

Durban's Super Giants spinner Prenelan Subrayen emphasised the importance of learning from their 28-run defeat against the Joburg Super Kings in the SA20 clash at Kingsmead on Tuesday. Despite Quinton de Kock ’s fighting 55 off 45 balls, the home side faltered, bowled out for 141 in their chase of 169/7.The spin trio of Tabraiz Shamsi, Donovan Ferreira, and Imran Tahir delivered a decisive performance, claiming five wickets collectively to secure JSK’s second consecutive win of the season.Reflecting on the defeat, Subrayen said, “I think the reflection had already started once the guys came off the field. I don’t think there will be any dwelling on it, but there will definitely be learning in terms of what we can do better going forward.”The Kingsmead pitch, which had seen recent rain, was not a significant factor, according to Subrayen. “I think it was kind of signature Kingsmead. I play a lot of my cricket here, so for me, it was normal. The field was a bit heavy because of the rain, but the wicket was fine.”Despite de Kock holding one end steady with five boundaries and two sixes, the Super Giants struggled to build partnerships. Subrayen attributed this to an off day rather than desperation. “I don’t think it was a sense of desperation. It was just probably not our day, with things not clicking. In a long tournament, you’re not going to play perfectly every game, but we definitely strive to.”Subrayen also addressed the extras conceded by the Super Giants, which amounted to 14 runs. “Over and above the 14 extras, there’s a lot of ‘should have, could have, would have’ moments you reflect on after a game. The first priority is to avoid extras, but no one’s perfect. It’s not like people are trying to bowl extras.”Looking ahead, Subrayen remained optimistic about the team’s ability to bounce back. “Every game is a new game, and the preparation leading up to those games remains the same. We take the learnings from this match and move forward.”With the SA20 season still in its early stages, Durban's Super Giants will aim to regroup and rebuild, drawing on lessons from their encounter with the formidable Joburg Super Kings.","Durban's Super Giants lost by 28 runs to Joburg Super Kings in SA20 clash.

NEW DELHI: Pretoria Capitals beat Sunrisers Eastern Cape by 6 wickets in the seventh match of SA20 2025, chasing down a modest target of 114 in Centurion for their first win of the season on Tuesday.After winning the toss, Pretoria Capitals captain Rilee Rossouw chose to field first, handing his team a massive advantage that led the Capitals to a comfortable victory.Sunrisers Eastern Cape's innings never gained momentum, as they were bundled out for just 113 runs in 19.4 overs.The innings got off to a poor start when Zak Crawley was dismissed early for just 1 run.

Rohit takes part in 45-min 'match simulation' at Mumbai Ranji team practice

MUMBAI: Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal , one of the few bright spots of India's recent tour of Australia, will turn out for Mumbai in their first match of the second leg of the Ranji Trophy against Jammu & Kashmir from January 23.""He has been asked to report for Mumbai practice from tomorrow. He is available for the match on January 23, and he will be picked for that game,"" a source in the Mumbai Cricket Association told TOI.The Mumbai selectors, led by Sanjay Patil, will pick the team soon for the J&K fixture.Jaiswal scored 391 runs in five Tests at an average of 43.44 in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy , with one century and two half-centuries.Interestingly, as per sources in the BCCI, Jaiswal has been ""rested"" from India's five-match T20 home series against England, which begins from Jan 22 in Kolkata, so that he remains fit and fresh for the ODI series against England and the Champions Trophy thereafter.Searching desperately for form ahead of the Champions Trophy, Indian cricket captain Rohit Sharma practised for around 45 minutes with the Mumbai team at the Wankhede Stadium on Tuesday morning, before attending a promotional event. Also present in the practice session were senior batters Ajinkya Rahane & Shreyas Iyer, and allrounder Shardul Thakur.""He batted for almost 45 minutes on the centre wicket in a match simulation environment. He started with throwdowns, followed by some batting in match simulation, during which he faced Mumbai's fast bowlers and spinners. However, he has still not conveyed to the Mumbai Cricket Association whether he will play in Mumbai's (sixth round) Ranji Trophy match against Jammu & Kashmir on Jan 23, as he's still double-minded about playing the Ranji match. That's a red-ball game, and the Champions Trophy in Feb, where he's likely to lead India, will be a white-ball, limited overs event,"" a source told TOI.Rohit, who expressed his desire to train with the Mumbai team to head coach Omkar Salvi, last played for Mumbai way back in a Ranji Trophy match in 2015 against Uttar Pradesh.The BCCI had advised all the players to turn out for their teams in the forthcoming rounds of the Ranji Trophy unless they are unfit or on national duty. Any exceptions will have to be given a green signal by head coach Gautam Gambhir and chief selector Ajit Agarkar The Mumbai team is supposed to practice at the Mumbai Cricket Association's ground in BKC for the next two days. Rohit could turn up for both these sessions,"" a source said.After India lost the BGT series 1-3 to Australia, India's head coach Gautam Gambhir had emphasised the importance of the Indian cricketers playing in domestic cricket and said that he would want everyone to play domestic cricket.""I would always like everyone to play domestic cricket. That is how much importance domestic cricket needs to be given. Not only one game but if they are available and have the commitment to play red-ball cricket, everyone should play domestic cricket. It's as simple as it can get. If you don't give importance to domestic cricket, you will never get the desired players that you want in Test cricket,"" Gambhir had said in a press conference after India's series defeat.The 37-year-old has been in the midst of a horror run with the bat, spread across the home Test series against New Zealand, and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia. Rohit managed to score just 31 runs in three Tests at an average of 6.20 in Australia, and opted out of the final Test in Sydney. Across the four Tests Down Under, his scores were 3,9, 10, 3, and 6.On Saturday, Rohit took part in a review meeting here to assess Team India’s performance in Australia, which was also attended by head coach Gautam Gambhir and BCCI’s new secretary Devajit Saikia.","Yashasvi Jaiswal will turn out for Mumbai in their first match of the second leg of the Ranji Trophy against Jammu & Kashmir from January 23.

Sadaoui netted the winner in the 90+5th minute, having earlier provided the assist for Jesus Jimenez 's strike in the 73rd minute.The match sprang to life as soon as it started, with Odisha FC taking an early advantage through Mawihmingthanga's goal in the fourth minute. A clearance from Odisha's half landed in the Blasters' penalty area. Despite the ball bouncing in front of Pritam Kotal, the Indian international hesitated and failed to make a proper clearance. Odisha's striker Dorielton Nascimento capitalised on the defensive error and directed a header towards Mawihmingthanga, who gently guided the ball past Sachin Suresh to put the visitors ahead.After falling behind, Blasters launched numerous attacks on the Odisha goalmouth, clearly controlling the latter part of the first half and the initial minutes of the second half. Their persistence paid off in the 60th minute. Korou Singh, who was positioned in the attacking third, surprisingly retreated to the midfield, catching the Odisha defence off guard. He then provided Kwame Peprah with a precise pass from the right of the centre line, splitting two Odisha defenders. Peprah, left with only goalkeeper Amrinder Singh to beat, slotted the ball skilfully to draw the scores level.Soon after the equaliser, Blasters strengthened their strike force by substituting defender Alexandre Coeff with striker Jesus Jimenez. This tactical change proved beneficial for the hosts when Jimenez put Blasters ahead in the 73rd minute. Luna delivered a cross from the right flank to Sadaoui positioned near the far post, who directed a header towards Jimenez. The striker simply extended his foot to guide the ball into the net, securing a 2-1 lead for Blasters.Odisha managed to level the score when Dorielton Nascimento converted a rebound in the 80th minute. However, Odisha's fortunes took a turn for the worse when Carlos Delgado, who entered as a substitute in the 66th minute, received his second yellow card in the 82nd minute for consecutive fouls, reducing his team to ten players.Blasters made the numerical superiority count when Sadaoui found the back of the net during stoppage time.

Coaching The Fundamental

Since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, Manchester United fans – particularly those who reached adolescence when the Class of 1992 made the first-team cut – have channelled their inner Ronin (Hawkeye’s murderous avatar into beg the team not to give hope. Over the years, there have been numerous false dawns, slivers of light ahead of the tunnel that have made United fans dream again before they were snatched away, like Morpheus’ Nebuchadnezzar’s lament: “I had a dream, but the dream was taken from me.”There was the Van Gaal era where fans were convinced that a former tactician – a man some claim invented modern football – could bring United back to the glory years. Then they convinced themselves that the Special One, by sheer dint of willpower and personality (and a little bit of the dark arts), the fallen Lucifer to Pep Guardiola’s Michael, would be the right person to resuscitate the Red Devils. They almost persuaded themselves, when Ole was at the wheel, that the good times were rolling again. It certainly felt like that on that night in Paris and when United were playing like the Fergie teams of yore. They even dared to hope that a man named Eric would lead the charge again, much like the collared Frenchman who did it in the early Fergie years.And now, Ruben Amorim, the youngest Man Utd manager in half a century, is playing the Pandora’s Box’s old trick again. Of course, on paper, Amorim’s record is nothing to write home about. His record in his first 13 games reads: five wins, two draws and six losses. Most other Man Utd managers actually have better records. Sir Alex Ferguson’s read: three wins, seven draws and three losses. It’s what came after those 13 games that makes Manchester United fans believe.But there has been something of the old grit that defined Fergie teams that has Utd fans daring to hope again. The back-to-the-wall performance evoked an older Man Utd vs Arsenal clash: the epic 1999 replay.The similarities are astounding between the 1999 FA Cup semi-final replay and the 2025 third-round showdown between the two clubs.The only difference in the 2025 match was that it was decided on penalty shootouts and not a wondrous Ryan Giggs goal that made Maradona look up from his cocaine pile.And in a strange way, it was a mirror image of the 2005 FA Cup final with its infamous Band of Brothers viral image featuring Paul Scholes, Roy Keane, Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney , Ryan Giggs, Mikaël Silvestre and Quinton Fortune.Incidentally, Manchester United battered Arsenal in that match – a follow-up to the infamous 4-2 “I will see you out there” Highbury fight – but still lost on a penalty shootout with Paul Scholes missing the last penalty. That day, United had eight shots on target, 12 off target, and 12 corners (far more than Arsenal) but still lost.It was a different ballgame in 2025. Arsenal had 26 shots to Man Utd’s seven, 71% of the possession, and a 3.3 xG to United’s 1.1 but failed to make their mark. United players have been struggling to adapt to Ruben Amorim’s style, but against Arsenal (like they did against Manchester City and Liverpool), there was a slight glimpse of the taste in the pudding.In the cult classic Coach Carter – when Samuel L. Jackson was whipping a bunch of askew young men into shape – he was asked by his team what they should do since they hadn’t practised attacking. To this, Jackson’s Carter had said: “Run.” And that’s what United players did in the match, all of them running together as a pack to keep Arsenal at bay.Harry Maguire, often the pantomime villain on the football pitch and even in parliaments around the world, was a colossus in defence. Equally driven were Lisandro Martínez and Matthijs de Ligt, the latter finally learning how to operate in a three-man midfield.Of course, Arsenal’s inability to finish was one of the major reasons this match went to penalties, with Kai Havertz moved around the pitch like Roy Keane was screaming “You can’t score in a brothel!” in his ear.But United fans will rejoice at the grit from a team that, during the last days of the Ten Hag era, looked like they were simply not interested in playing football. Whether it was Bayindir’s redemption after the horror performance against Tottenham in the Carabao Cup, academy graduate Toby Collyer’s gut-bursting runs, Bruno’s Roy Keane impression or Noussair Mazraoui and Manuel Ugarte in midfield, this was a team effort.And the performance came against refereeing that launched a thousand memes about Arsenal players diving with abandon, which included a soft penalty and a red card.A swallow doesn’t make a summer, and Manchester United will probably have to suffer for many more years before they finally have a team worthy of cleaning the boots of any of the vintage Ferguson teams. But for the moment, United fans can at least hope that the current side, even if they lack the sheer world-class talent of the Band of Brothers or the 1999 winning team or any of the great Fergie teams, will give it their all every time they are wearing the United shirt.Next up in the FA Cup: Ruud van Nistelrooy’s Leicester City, the last interim manager of Manchester United and a man who knows a thing or two about the gigantic expectations that come with wearing the Manchester United shirt.",Manchester United lost 3-2 to Arsenal in the 2025 FA Cup third round. The match was a mirror image of the epic 1999 FA Cup semi-final replay. The only difference between the two matches was that it was decided on penalty shootouts.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117203496,imgsize-67192,width-400,resizemode-4/117203496.jpg"
ISL: Mumbai left to rue another 0-3 defeat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/isl-mumbai-left-to-rue-another-0-3-defeat/articleshow/117186879.cms,"MUMBAI: One thing's for sure, two-time ISL champions and reigning Cup holders Mumbai City, are looking vulnerable this season, particularly at home!On Sunday, the Islanders crashed to their third defeat at the Mumbai Football Arena, falling to a 0-3 loss to Jamshedpur. In an alarming coincidence, each of their three home losses in this ISL campaign have come by that very scoreline.In a game that took until the second half to come to life, it was Mohammed Sanan who set the visitors on their way in the 64th minute with a clinical finish.Just as Mumbai City so nearly drew level when Nikolaos Karelis's left-footed effort stung Albino Gomes's palms in the closing minutes, Jordan Murray (86th) sealed the three points for Khalid Jamil's side following a quick break after Jamshedpur had won back possession.There was time for one final dagger which arrived in stoppage time as Javi Hernandez (90+6) fired home from inside the box.The win saw Jamshedpur climb to third place, level on points with Bengaluru (27pts) with a game in hand. Mumbai, meanwhile, still occupy sixth spot and that final playoff berth, but were left to rue another bitter outing at home. Although they went into this game with a confidence-boosting 3-2 win at East Bengal last week, there is no doubt that the Islanders are finding goals hard to come by this season.Coach Petr Kratky has even resorted to switching captain Lallianzuala Chhangte from his favoured position on the right of their usual three-man attack to playing in the hole behind the front three.It would yield no dividends on this occasion, as Jamshedpur's backline were disciplined enough to deal with anything Karelis, Vikram Partap Singh or Bipin Singh were able to ask of them.To make matters worse, Chhangte was sent off after the game for dissent.","Jamshedpur beat Mumbai City 0-3 at the Mumbai Football Arena.

Altay Bayindir was the unexpected hero for Manchester United as they edged past Arsenal in a dramatic FA Cup encounter at the Emirates. The match ended 1-1 after 90 minutes, and United triumphed 5-4 on penalties, with Bayindir making crucial saves both in normal time and during the shootout to send the holders into the fourth round.United took the lead early in the second half when Bruno Fernandes unleashed a thunderous strike into the top corner, capitalising on a slip by Gabriel after Alejandro Garnacho's incisive run. However, the game turned when Diogo Dalot received a second yellow card on the hour mark for a reckless challenge, leaving United to defend with 10 men for over half an hour.Arsenal wasted no time exploiting their numerical advantage as Gabriel Magalhães scored the equaliser, with Bayindir failing to deal with Gabriel Martinelli’s cross, resulting in a deflected shot finding the net.Despite dominating possession and creating multiple chances, Arsenal failed to capitalise. Their woes were compounded when Bayindir saved Martin Odegaard’s penalty following a controversial decision against Harry Maguire, who was furious at the call and clashed with Kai Havertz during the ensuing melee.Bayindir redeemed himself further with a stunning stop to deny Declan Rice and another to keep Havertz at bay as Arsenal squandered golden opportunities to secure the win in regulation.In the penalty shootout, United were flawless. Fernandes, Amad Diallo, Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez, and Josua Zirkzee all converted their spot-kicks, with Zirkzee calmly scoring the decisive penalty. Bayindir’s save against Havertz in the shootout proved pivotal, capping a remarkable performance for the Turkish goalkeeper.The defeat deepens Arsenal’s recent struggles, coming on the back of a League Cup semi-final first-leg loss to Newcastle. Manager Mikel Arteta expressed his frustration, stating, ""We deserved to win based on performance, but the reality is we’re out.""Arsenal’s misery was compounded by the sight of Gabriel Jesus being stretchered off in the first half with a suspected knee injury, adding to their growing list of absentees.For United, the win was a testament to their resilience under manager Ruben Amorim, who praised his side’s character in a hard-fought victory.

This win marks the first trophy for Barcelona under manager Hansi Flick .Barcelona's impressive performance helped them secure a record-extending 15th Spanish Super Cup title. Kylian Mbappe gave Real Madrid an early lead.

Robert Lewandowski then put Barcelona ahead with a penalty kick. Raphinha scored twice, and Alejandro Balde also found the net.Rodrygo Goes managed to score a free-kick for Real Madrid, but they couldn't capitalise on their numerical advantage after Szczesny's sending-off. The defeat was a humbling experience for the European champions.""I think today is a good day because we beat one of the best teams in the world, for the second time this season, Real Madrid, and this is unbelievable. We won a title here and we are really happy... today is a day to look positively at this team,"" Flick said after the match.Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti attributed the heavy defeat to his team's defensive shortcomings.""We defended badly and that cost us the game -- they found their goals quite easily. We're sad, like all our fans, it's disappointing and we don't have to hide that... we have to look forwards, there's nothing else we can do,"" Ancelotti said.Despite Barcelona's strong start, Real Madrid took the lead in the fifth minute. Kylian Mbappe scored a brilliant counter-attack goal.The French forward, who had been frustrated by offside calls in the previous league defeat against Barcelona, broke free after Vinicius Jr . won possession. He then sprinted into the penalty area and chipped the ball past Szczesny.Lamine Yamal, the 17-year-old winger, scored a stunning individual goal to level the score. He cut in from the right and placed a low shot inside the near post, reminiscent of Lionel Messi.Barcelona continued to press forward and took the lead with a penalty kick converted by Robert Lewandowski. The penalty was awarded after Eduardo Camavinga's late and reckless challenge on Gavi.Raphinha extended Barcelona's lead with a header from Jules Kounde's cross. Barcelona then scored their fourth goal before halftime on a counter-attack. Yamal and Raphinha combined, and Raphinha set up Alejandro Balde, who calmly slotted the ball past Thibaut Courtois.Barcelona maintained their momentum in the second half. Raphinha scored their fifth goal with a skillful dribble and finish after being played in by Marc Casado.Barcelona was reduced to 10 men when Mbappe was brought down outside the penalty area by goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. Mbappe had rounded Szczesny, and after a VAR review, the goalkeeper was sent off.Rodrygo, who had earlier hit the post, converted the resulting free-kick past Szczesny's replacement, Inaki Pena.Mbappe created a chance for Jude Bellingham, but the English midfielder's shot was blocked by a superb challenge from Jules Kounde in stoppage time.Mbappe also came close to scoring again with a fine individual effort, but his shot was saved by Inaki Pena.","Barcelona beat Real Madrid 5-2 in the Spanish Super Cup Clasico final held in Saudi Arabia.

Carlo Ancelotti calls on Real Madrid to avoid repeating Clasico mistakes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/carlo-ancelotti-calls-on-real-madrid-to-avoid-repeating-clasico-mistakes/articleshow/117146797.cms,"Carlo Ancelotti (AP Photo)

Real Madrid's coach, Carlo Ancelotti, believes his team can avenge their previous defeat against Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday. He emphasized the importance of learning from past mistakes to secure a victory.Barcelona had convincingly defeated Real Madrid 4-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu in La Liga earlier in the season. However, Real Madrid managed to surpass them in the league standings before the winter break.“We have to think about that game obviously, they beat us, we had a clear evaluation of what happened.”Ancelotti acknowledged the significance of the previous encounter and the need to analyze their performance. He stressed the importance of replicating the positive aspects of their play while avoiding past errors.“We started the game well, then had problems in the second half, so we have to try and repeat the good things we did and avoid the mistakes we made.”The added pressure of a final against their rivals adds another layer of complexity to the upcoming match. Ancelotti acknowledged the unique nature of Clasico finals.“The Clasico is even more pressured when it's a final, we've played a lot against Barcelona and playing a final against them is always something special.”Real Madrid's challenge lies in finding a balance between their attacking prowess and defensive solidity, especially after Kylian Mbappe 's arrival. The attacking quartet of Mbappe, Vinicius Junior, Jude Bellingham, and Rodrygo Goes offers significant offensive firepower. However, their defensive contributions are crucial for team balance.“(In recent Clasicos) individual quality has prevailed over team balance.”Ancelotti highlighted the importance of collective effort and defensive stability in such high-stakes matches.“An important aspect tomorrow will be balance and collective work -- defending.”He firmly believes that a strong defensive performance increases their chances of winning.“If you defend well, there's more chance of winning.”Despite a successful 2024 season with La Liga and Champions League titles, Ancelotti admitted that the heavy defeat against Barcelona remained a low point.“We're close to another trophy, we're thinking positively, but we know that in football anything can happen, above all when the opponent is strong and competes well like Barcelona.”Ancelotti acknowledged the unpredictable nature of football, particularly against a strong opponent like Barcelona. He also highlighted Real Madrid's progress and improvement as a team.“Our team has improved, nobody can argue with that.”He expressed confidence in their continued progress regardless of the outcome of the Super Cup final.“A defeat wouldn't be good but the team is not going backwards, it will keep moving forwards.”Dani Olmo's availability for Barcelona after a controversial temporary license approval by the Spanish national sports council (CSD) presents a challenge for Real Madrid.“Olmo will play and we have to minimise his quality.”Ancelotti chose to focus on minimizing Olmo's impact on the game rather than commenting on the controversy surrounding his eligibility.Barcelona coach Hansi Flick confirmed Olmo's readiness to play but hinted at a possible starting role for Gavi.“Gavi had a great performance against Athletic, he's got confidence... I think he's is going to play, but I am not 100 percent sure of who will play.”The Super Cup final represents Flick's first opportunity to win a trophy with Barcelona. He acknowledged the importance of a victory for the team's confidence.“If we win, we will have more confidence for the rest of the season.”He further emphasized the significance of winning the game for everyone involved.“Winning the game would be something really big for everyone.”",Real Madrid face Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday.

Sometimes it's a little conference when players walk to their towels, the coaches are courtside and on their feet, using the opportunity to communicate, other times it's a word or a nod, a little insight a player might need to press forward.Daniil Medvedev turned to his coaches Gilles Cervara and Gilles Simon for answers during his first round clash against Thailand's Kasidit Samrej on Rod Laver Arena on Tuesday.The Russian was surprised by the range of the 23-year-old Samrej, a wildcard entrant ranked 418, brought to the court.""If he plays like this every match, his life can be good – money, girls, casino whatever,"" Medvedev joked on court and with his team.The Australian Open introduced the coaching pod for the players this year, they are positioned in two corners and allow up to four people. These pods have access to real-time data and coaches have the option to sit there or take their places in the traditional player box, where the teams sit.Medvedev, the Australian Open's fifth seed, was in all sorts of trouble, but managed to turn things around for a 6-2, 4-6, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 win that took him into the second round, where he plays another qualifier American Learner Tien. Novak Djokovic , in the hunt for a 25th major crown, did the same late on Monday against the 19-year-old Indian-American Nishesh Basavareddy.The 37-year-old turned to his courtside box in which another 37-year-old sat, two-time Wimbledon Champion Andy Murray.The Scot lost four of his five Australian Open finals to Djokovic on the Rod Laver Arena between 2011 to 2016.""The new coaching seats are basically on the court, in the corner, which allows me to hear them better,"" Djokovic said. ""I did approach Andy a few times, he was giving me his feedback, guidance and opinion. I enjoy talking to Andy… He understands the highs and lows that you go through on the court, not just game-wise but mentally and physically. I don't need to do much explaining. He gets everything that I'm going through.""""At times it's not necessary for us to exchange words because we just look at each other and we know what happened on the court, whether it's in the match or in a practice session. He's constantly supportive and encouraging me. He's brilliant with that. He cares a lot and he's putting a lot of energy into trying to make me feel good on the court. I was looking for that extra motivation. I definitely have it with Andy.""Mirra Andreeva and her coach, former Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez spark wholesome vibes.The 17-year-old Russian, ranked No.15, said while the 52-year-old Spaniard helped with her play, Martinez' sense of humour has improved being around the teenager.""I really like our relationship, because I like to joke around. I don't really like to be very serious, I always try to smile and laugh. It's just easier like this,"" she said. ""I was surprised in the beginning that Conchita is also like me. Since we started working together, she's trying to say a joke or just laugh sometimes.""Iga Swiatek , who is in Australia with her new coach Wim Fissette, said it was convenient to have coaches at courtside rather than in the stands.""It makes sense, because now if you play on a smaller court you can use it, if you play on the stadium court too, you can use it,"" she said, adding that players can actually hear what their coaches were saying to them.""If you have good communication with your coach, I think it might work,"" she said. ""We had this rule for a long time now, but in big courts you didn't hear what people were saying to you.""Not everyone was excited with the opportunity, World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka prefers bigger boxes.""I like to see the whole team even if I'm not looking at each person in my box. I always look at my coach, but I still see everyone, for me that's important,"" she said. ""Sometimes I just want to look at my boyfriend for support, for example.

NEW DELHI: Gael Monfils would have preferred to have defeated rising Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in straight sets at the Australian Open's first round.But he was able to win it in five sets thanks to the entertainer's instinct.Age, experience, and stamina outlasted strength and youth in a fight between 38-year-old Monfils and 21-year-old Mpetshi Perricard, which helped negate one of the greatest serves in tennis.Monfils lost the third set and on Mpetshi Perricard's service in the fifth set before ultimately winning 7-6 (7), 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6-7 (5), 6-4.

Both occasionally take the unorthodox route to point-setting and occasionally use between-the-legs shots during rallies.Monfils, who has a 34-18 career record and been to the Australian Open quarterfinals in 2016 and 2022, got the upper hand against a player making his Melbourne Park debut .With the exception of Wimbledon , where he made it to the fourth round as a lucky loser the previous year, Mpetshi Perricard had never made it past the first round at any major. However, following a breakthrough year in 2024 that saw him win two titles, he was seeded 30th.Monfils now has a 20-19 win-loss record in five-set matches and is the Frenchman with the most Grand Slam singles victories.""I've been enjoying myself since the first day I played tennis and (at) 60 years old I will still have this joy,"" he had said after taking home the title in Auckland.","Gael Monfils beats Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard 7-6 (7), 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6 -7 (5),6-4.

Melbourne: For Emma Raducanu , winning in the first round at the the Australian Open was always going to be more important than how she achieved the result.That was clear Tuesday when the 2021 U.S. Open champion celebrated her 7-6 (4), 7-6 (2) win over No. 26-seeded Ekaterina Alexandrova out on Court 3, where a scattering of British flags fluttered in a light breeze on Day 3 at Melbourne Park.In her first match since November, the 22-year-old British player served 15 double-faults, made 30 unforced errors and won just 30% of points on her second serve. But she was good enough in the big moments, with 22 winners and nine aces, to claw her way into the second round.Because she wasn't playing competitively, the biggest news about her back home was her minor back trouble earlier this month and the fact she refused treatment for ant bites last week - just to be on the safe side in terms of medication that might run her afoul of anti-doping regulations.Alexandrova served for the first set, which contained eight service breaks, but Raducanu broke back immediately.In the second set, Raducanu led 4-2 but then lost control of her serve again and needed to save a set point before forcing another tiebreaker, which she dominated.Raducanu raced to a 6-0 lead in the breaker and, with too much of a lead to worry, held her nerve to clinch her first win of 2025.Since becoming the first player to win a Grand Slam title after going through qualifying, Raducanu hasn't been past the fourth round of a major. She has reached the third round for the last three years in Australia.She'll next play Amanda Anisimova, who had a 6-2, 6-3 win over Maria Carle.","Emma Raducanu beat Ekaterina Alexandrova in first round of Australian Open.

Australian Open fifth seed Daniil Medvedev had a challenging start to his Australian Open campaign on Tuesday. During his first round match against Kasidit Samrej , Medvedev displayed frustration by damaging a net camera at the end of the third set.Medvedev, the 2021 US Open champion and a three-time Australian Open finalist, faced a tough opponent in Samrej. The wildcard entry from Thailand, ranked 418th, was making his Grand Slam debut.His bout of anger came after losing a 13-stroke rally to trail 40-15. Samrej's shot clipped the net, altering its trajectory and threw the Russian off balance. It provided the Thai player with a chance to hit a cross-court forehand passing winner.Medvedev went up to the net and thumped it five times with his racket, breaking his equipment while shattering a small black camera and sending pieces of it flying. It earned him a code violation warning for racket abuse from the chair umpire.“I know I play better when I play more tennis,” Medvedev joked afterward. “So I was like, ‘Why play 1 hour, 30 (minutes)?’ Need a minimum of three hours, at least, to feel my shots better.”Losing the third set put Medvedev in a difficult position. He needed to rally to avoid an unexpected first-round exit in the 2025 season.Meanwhile, Samrej had the opportunity to achieve a significant upset. He was aiming to become the lowest-ranked player to defeat a top-five seed at a Grand Slam since the ATP's computerised rankings began in 1973, according to the International Tennis Federation.The record for such an upset belongs to Alex Kim. The American, ranked 234th, defeated fourth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov at the 2002 Australian Open.Samrej secured his spot in the Australian Open draw through a wildcard playoff. He won four rounds in the Asia-Pacific region in November. Prior to facing Medvedev, he had never played against an opponent ranked higher than 78th. He had also never defeated a player ranked higher than 157th.Despite Samrej's battling show, physical issues meant his tennis dropped while Medvedev was able to escape with a five-set win.The Russian eventually won 6-2, 4-6 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 to avoid becoming the first runner-up from the previous year to suffer a first-round exit at the Australian Open since Rainer Schuttler in 2004.Medvedev turned things around after dropping the third set, claiming 12 of the remaining 15 games, and 61 of the remaining 94 points.He finished with 24 aces and fewer than half as many unforced errors as Samrej , 34 to 69.“In the end of last year, this match, I probably would have lost it,” said Medvedev, who went 3-1 in five-setters at the 2024 Australian Open. “New year, new energy.”","Daniil Medvedev beat Kasidit Samrej 6-2, 4-6 3-6, 6-1,6-2 in the first round of the Australian Open in Melbourne.

Melbourne put its hands together for their defending champion Jannik Sinner – clapping with carrots, cheering wildly in Italian, the second largest ethnic group in the Victorian capital city owning their place in the order of things, waving flags and exercising their vocal chords – they welcomed the world No.1 onto Rod Laver Arena to kickstart his Australian Open title defence in raucous fashion.It was not all love and sunny skies for Sinner though, there were some boos too, which was drowned out by the cheering for both men in the middle – Sinner and his 29-year-old opponent from Chile Nicolas Jarry .Sinner, 23, still dealing with the ramifications of the positive drug tests of 2024 that has led the World Anti-Doping Agency to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which has scheduled a hearing in April, faces a potential ban of up to two years.The world No.1, who has pushed relentlessly in the face of a disturbing storm, wondered what kind of a reception he would get at Melbourne Park, where he claimed his maiden Grand Slam title 12 months ago. Mainly because of the stinging tirade by fellow pro Aussie Nick Kyrgios, who has stopped at nothing.""I was curious to see how it was (going to be),"" Sinner said after the 7-6 (2), 7-6 (5), 6-1 win over Jarry. ""You never know what's (going) to happen. I was happy, it was a very nice crowd. There were some (people) for my opponent and some for me. It was a nice atmosphere.""Sinner, who plays Aussie wildcard entrant Tristan Schoolkate in the second round on Thursday, had quite the test on his hands against Jarry in the first set that lasted 72-minutes, a documentary on its own.The Italian, whose gear was of the palest yellow, a fabric that appeared to have lost its colour much like a summer's day without its customary sizzle, however made up with his play, staying strong in second set, before breaking the Chilean and taking charge of the third set.Jarry, who had tested positive for Lindanrol and Stanozolal, and was suspended from the Tour for ten months from January 2020, before the ITF ruled that he 'bore no significant fault or negligence for his violation', said the suspension had weighed him down mentally. The world No.36 told reporters he too would've liked to have got some of the support Sinner enjoyed from the tennis world.""I don't know the details of his case,"" Sinner said. ""What I can say is that we got treated in the same way, there's the protocol. If the protocol has some issues then it's not my fault. Of course, I'm very sorry for the players who (face) these kinds of things, but I don't know exactly the details about his case.

When Novak Djokovic broke Nishesh Basavareddy for the first time in the match after 91 minutes of play, he let out a roar that echoed across Melbourne’s bustling Central Business District. It was just the first round of the Australian Open , but the 37-year-old, ten-time champion wore his hunger on his sleeve. A naked expression, a fire that rages, every point, every game.Djokovic came through 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 in the near three-hours on Rod Laver Arena late on Monday, but that is only half the story.To be sure the 19-year-old Indian-American, a Data Science student in Stanford University until November, had his idol in a spot early in the match, even raising visions of an upset, much like another teenager Croat Dino Prizmic did last year.Basavareddy, whose stellar charge on the ATP Challenger circuit last year earned him the USTA wildcard for the Australian Open, pulled off audacious dropshots and lobs in the first set, executing to perfection, especially on the return game, that had the near 15,000 crowd gasping.His peers in the juniors and later on the collegiate circuit often compared his play to Djokovic’s all-court style, for a little over an hour, Basavareddy showed why.“I was very impressed by him. I think the whole stadium was that's why he got a great round of applause and appreciation from the crowd,” Djokovic said of Basavareddy. “They saw what he did on the court, the quality of tennis he put in, the fighting spirit. Huge credit to him for stepping out on his debut in a Grand Slam, first time on a big court, playing the way he did. I'm sure if he keeps going this way, he's very young, we’re going to see quite a bit of him in the future.”“He's got really great hands,” the Serb added. “Overall, a complete player. He can always improve on the shots, (but) he already has a really good game.”Basavareddy, whose family has roots in Hyderabad and Nellore, had his coach Bryan Smith along with his father Murali Reddy, who works in the tech industry, and older brother Nishanth, an information system major, in his courtside box, along with doubles ace Indian-American Rajeev Ram.The other side had some 27 major singles titles between them, Djokovic is now coached by three-time champion Andy Murray.“You try to focus on the court, but sometimes I go to my towel and I hear him (Andy) saying, ‘Let's go, Novak,’ and I look over and it's pretty crazy,” Basavareddy said.It was perhaps the occasion that got Basavareddy on Monday evening, playing against the man whose photograph he has as his WhatsApp display picture, the teenager struggled with cramps late in the second set and needed treatment.“He makes it really physical out there,” the teenager said of his legendary opponent. “I started feeling it a little bit in the second set, but it only lasted a couple of games. I took a couple drinks and stuff, that helped it go down in the third set. I feel better now. Just unfortunate timing in the middle of the match.”Seeing Djokovic on the other side of the net was a surreal moment for Basavareddy at the start of the match.“The coin toss was a little surreal, just seeing him in front of me, going to be competitors today. Just a cool feeling, for sure,” he said. “Obviously on the court he does everything really well, serving really well. I think that's the biggest thing he's improved in his career. Today that was a big difference between him and me, that ended up giving him the win.”","Novak Djokovic beats Nishesh Basavareddy 4-6 6-3 6-4 6-2 in the first round of the Australian Open.

NEW DELHI: Nick Kyrgios 's much-anticipated return to the Australian Open ended abruptly on Monday as the volatile hometown favorite crashed out in straight sets during the first round, venting his frustration at his coaching team throughout the match.Britain's Jacob Fearnley silenced the typically raucous John Cain Arena crowd with a composed 7-6 (7/3), 6-3, 7-6 (7/2) victory over the 2022 Wimbledon finalist.Kyrgios had only recently returned to competition after an 18-month layoff, during which he underwent knee surgery and wrist reconstruction.Concerns about Kyrgios's fitness had resurfaced when he withdrew from an exhibition match against Novak Djokovic four days prior, citing an abdominal strain.The fears were confirmed during the match, as the Australian called for physio assistance multiple times in the second set and visibly winced while serving.""I'm sorry for Nick,"" said Fearnley. ""I could tell he was dealing with some issues.""I knew I wasn't going to be able to get you guys on my side,"" Fearnley told the pro-Kyrgios crowd.""So I was just trying to focus on myself, try to play my game and do the best I could to try to move past every point.""I think all things considered, it's probably the best match I've ever played.""The first set saw few break opportunities, with both players dominating on serve. However, Fearnley, ranked 92nd in the world, seized control during the tiebreak, surging to a 6-1 lead with a cross-court pass and an ace.Kyrgios fended off two of five set points with powerful serves but ultimately conceded the set in 45 minutes.Kyrgios, visibly frustrated, directed a barrage of verbal outbursts at his coaching box between sets. Despite the distractions, Fearnley maintained his composure, breaking Kyrgios early in the second set and comfortably closing it out.""What's the point, boys?"" shouted Kyrgios at his team, in one of his milder outbursts.""I'm going to keep going until I can't any more.""Fearnley secured another early break in the third set, but Kyrgios, ever the showman, rallied for a late surge.Battling through evident pain, he broke back, held serve to love for a 4-3 lead, and briefly electrified the crowd.The Australian earned a set point at 4-5 on Fearnley's serve, but the Briton calmly saved it to force a tiebreak.In the decisive tiebreak, Fearnley held his nerve to seal the match after 2 hours and 19 minutes.

NEW DELHI: At the end of 2023, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty had the world at their feet. They were ranked world No. 1 in men's doubles in October, becoming the first Indian doubles pair to do so. They became the first Indian men's doubles pair to win a BWF World Super 1000 title when they clinched the 2023 Indonesia Open.The Asian Games gold as well as the 2023 Asian Championships gold were historic firsts too.When the pair entered 2024 - an Olympic year - Satwik and Chirag were India's brightest hopes for a medal at the Paris Olympics . But the duo crashed out in the quarterfinals in Paris. Their defeat not only left them stunned, but also an entire nation.Their Danish coach Mathias Boe stepped down from his position after that loss. Boe's resignation led to Badminton Association of India (BAI) bringing back Malaysian doubles specialist Tan Kim Her , who was going through a highly successful stint with the Japanese national team, in December last year.During his first spell with Indian badminton between 2015-19, Tan was instrumental in bringing Satwik and Chirag together, recognizing their potential as a formidable doubles pair. His coaching helped shape their careers, leading them to significant achievements including podium finishes in various tournaments. Their partnership thrived due to Tan's strategic approach and emphasis on building personal chemistry between the players.Back at the helm, Tan has started giving immediate results. At the just-concluded Malaysia Open and the preceding China Masters in 2024, Satwik and Chirag managed to reach the semifinals.""We've shown consistency. In the last two tournaments, especially the China Open, we came back after a long gap, and to even reach the semifinals was unexpected. In Malaysia, we had some good wins but lost in the semifinals. Winning a tournament is always the goal when we enter, and I wouldn't say we're satisfied with just the semifinal finish. We want to go as deep as possible at the India Open,"" Satwik told TOI.Speaking about their relationship with Tan, Chirag said, ""To have Tan back as our coach after 5-6 years is great. A lot of credit goes to him for our achievements. We were still youngsters when he paired us up, and it was much more directional back then. But the approach is very different now; it's much more conversational.""He added: ""We're already established now, so we discuss what we need to do and as a coach, he shares his opinion. We have immense trust in him.""Chirag revealed that since Tan's return, the duo has been working on improving defence and net play. ""It's the minor changes that really matter. Everybody knows how to smash, but it's the tactical details and small improvements that we need to focus on. We are working on that with Tan, especially improving our defence, which is good but not the best in the world yet,"" said Chirag.With Tan by their side, the duo also reflected on their shock quarterfinal loss at the Paris Olympics.""He shared his thoughts on our quarterfinal loss, where he felt we fell short. It was similar to our own assessment. We should have been better with our net play, especially during the crucial stages. They challenged us well at the net, and that's one area we hope to improve upon with coach Tan by our side,"" Chirag added.",Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty had the world at their feet.

Indians at India Open

NEW DELHI: After a year that can at best be termed a ""mixed bag"" for Indian badminton , the country's top shuttlers will look to kick off 2025 on a high note as the India Open Super 750 tournament begins here at the KD Jadhav Indoor Stadium on Tuesday.The tournament will feature 16 of the world's top-20 men's singles players and 14 of the top20 women's singles shuttlers.Interestingly, there hasn't been an Indian success at the tournament since 2022, when Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty won the men's doubles title and Lakshya Sen clinched the men's singles crown.Last year, Indian shuttlers struggled to secure titles. The only significant victories came from Satwik and Chirag, who won titles at the French Open and Thailand Open just before the Olympics.The Paris Games saw the Indian badminton team return without securing any medal. PV Sindhu , a two-time Olympic medallist, was eliminated in the pre-quarterfinals. Lakshya Sen lost in the bronze-medal match to Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia.Satwik and Chirag, who were primed to win the men's doubles gold, made a shocking exit in the quarterfinals. Here, they will face Malaysia's Wei Chong Man and Kai Wun Tee in the opening round.Despite a disappointing 2024, one can never count out two-time Olympic medallist PV Sindhu. Sindhu will begin against Shuo Yun Sung of Chinese Taipei. In the men's singles, Lakshya and HS Prannoy will lead the Indian campaign.With top international stars like Olympic champions Viktor Axelsen and An Se Young leading the field, this edition promises to live up to its billing.Men's Singles: Lakshya Sen, HS Prannoy, Priyanshu Rajawat, Kidambi Srikanth, Kiran GeorgeWomen's Singles: PV Sindhu, Malvika Bansod, Anupama Upadhyaya, Aakarshi Kashyap, Rakshitha SreeMen's Doubles: Chirag Shetty/ Satwiksairaj Rankireddy, K Sai Pratheek/Pruthvi K Roy, Mayank Rana/Chayanit JoshiWomen's Doubles: Treesa Jolly/ Gayatri Gopichand, Ashwini Ponnappa/Tanisha Crasto, Rutuparna Panda/Swetaparna Panda, Mansa Rawat/Gayatri Rawat, Ashwini Bhat/Shikha Gautam, Sakshi Gahlawat/Apoorva Gahlawat, Sania Sikkandar/Rashmi Ganesh, Mrunmayee Deshpande/Prerana Alvekar, Amrutha Pramuthesh/ Sonali Singh, Kavya Gupta/Radhika SharmaMixed Doubles: Dhruv Kapila/ Tanisha Crasto , K Sathish Kumar/ Aadya Variyath, Rohan Kapoor/G Ruthvika Shivani, Ashith Surya/ Amrutha Pramuthesh, Tarun Kona/ Sri Krishna Priya","The India Open Super 750 begins in New Delhi on Tuesday.

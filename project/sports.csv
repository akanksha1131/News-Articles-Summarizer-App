NEW DELHI: India pacer Mohammed Siraj and Australia’s star batter Travis Head are reportedly under ICC scrutiny following a heated exchange during the second Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Adelaide. Australia won the match by 10 wickets, leveling the series 1-1.The incident occurred during the 82nd over of Australia's innings when Siraj bowled a stunning in-swinging yorker to dismiss Head. Following the wicket, Siraj gave Head a fiery send-off, gesturing aggressively towards the stands.In response, Head exchanged words with Siraj before walking off to applause from the home crowd.The incident triggered a backlash from the Adelaide crowd, which booed Siraj whenever he fielded near the boundary or came on to bowl, expressing displeasure at his conduct.According to The Daily Telegraph, both Siraj and Head are expected to face a disciplinary hearing for their on-field altercation. However, they are unlikely to receive suspensions, as such incidents typically attract milder penalties.Head, who was named Player of the Match, addressed the incident during a press interaction, revealing that he had said ""Well bowled, mate"" after hitting Siraj for a six prior to his dismissal. While he expressed regret over his reaction, he defended his decision to stand his ground.“It probably (went) a little bit far; that’s why I’m disappointed in the reaction I gave back, but I’m also going to stand up for myself. Like to think in our team, we wouldn’t do that. [It’s] not the way I’d like to play the game and feel like my teammates are the same. If I see that, I probably call it out, which I did,” Head said during the press conference.Siraj, however, disputed Head’s account in an interview with Star Sports ahead of Day 3.“When you get hit for a six on a good ball, it fires you up differently. And when I got him bowled, I only celebrated, and he abused me, and you saw that on TV, too,"" he told Star Sports.“I only celebrated at the start; I didn’t say anything to him. What he said in the press conference wasn’t right, it’s a lie that he only said ‘well bowled’ to me. It’s there for everyone to see that that’s not what he said to me. We respect everyone; it’s not like we disrespect other players. I respect everybody because cricket is a gentleman’s game, but what he did wasn’t right. I didn’t like it at all.”By Day 3, tensions seemed to have eased. The two players were seen chatting when Siraj came out to bat during India’s second innings, signaling that they may have put the incident behind them.","Mohammed Siraj and Travis Head reportedly under ICC scrutiny following heated exchange.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals ' newly-appointed head coach Hemang Badani shared a contrasting view on Rishabh Pant 's departure, differing from co-owner Parth Jindal's earlier claim that money wasn’t the primary factor during the IPL mega auction held in Jeddah on November 24 and 25.The auction saw Pant break records, becoming the costliest player ever, as Lucknow Super Giants secured him for ?27 crore. Delhi Capitals tried to retain him using the Right to Match card at ?21 crore, but Lucknow outbid them.""I think it's the other way around. He wanted not to be retained. He said he wanted to go to the auction and test the market. If you want to retain a player, both parties (the team and the player) have to agree on certain things. We tried talking to him, the management tried talking to him. There were a lot of phone calls and messages exchanged,"" Badani said during a YouTube show with Subramaniam Badrinath.Badani confirmed that the franchise was keen to retain Pant.""Yes (Delhi Capitals were interested in retaining him). He said he wanted to go to the auction and test the market. He said he had a feeling that there were chances he would get more money than the highest cap for retained player, which is Rs 18 crore.""""And, at the end of the day, he felt he was worth more. And the market said the same thing. He got Rs 27 crore. Good for him. He is a very good player. We will obviously miss him. But, life goes on,"" Badani added.Earlier, Pant had denied that his decision was financially motivated, stating on social media, ""My retention wasn’t about the money for sure that I can say."" However, the auction results told a different story.Delhi Capitals regrouped after Pant’s departure by acquiring KL Rahul for Rs 14 crore and Mitchell Starc for Rs 11 crore, bolstering their squad with strategic signings.Jindal expressed his emotions in a heartfelt post on X about Pant’s exit.""To Rishabh @RishabhPant17 you are and will always remain my younger brother - from the bottom of my heart I love you and I have tried everything to make sure you are happy and have treated you like my family,"" Jindal wrote.""I am very sad to see you go and I am very emotional about it. You will always be in DC and I hope one day we can reunite. Thank you for everything Rishabh and remember that we will always love you - go well champ, the world is at your feet. Best wishes from all of us at @DelhiCapitals - other than when you play DC I will be cheering and hoping for the best for you!""Pant responded warmly, saying, ""Thanku bhaiya the feeling is mutual. Means a lot.""In his farewell note, Pant also acknowledged Delhi Capitals’ fans for their unwavering support over the years.""Goodbyes are never easy,"" he wrote. ""The journey with Delhi Capitals has been nothing short of amazing... I've grown in ways I never imagined. I came here as a teenager and we grew together over the last nine years.""""As I move on, I carry your love and support in my heart. I'll look forward to entertain you whenever I take the field. Thank you for being my family and making this journey so special,"" he added.Delhi Capitals ended the auction with 19 new players, complementing their retained core of Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Tristan Stubbs, and Abhishek Porel. Among their key moves was buying back Jake Fraser-McGurk for Rs 9 crore and adding KL Rahul to the roster.","Rishabh Pant becomes most expensive IPL player after he goes to LSG for Rs 27 crore at IPL auction.

NEW DELHI: Sherfane Rutherford 's outstanding debut century guided the West Indies to a five-wicket victory against Bangladesh in the opening one-day international at Warner Park on Sunday.In his 10th ODI appearance, Rutherford's spectacular innings of 113 from 80 deliveries, featuring seven fours and eight sixes, brought West Indies close to achieving the ground's highest successful chase.The 26-year-old entered at 94-3 as West Indies pursued Bangladesh's total of 294-6 from their allocated 50 overs.He formed a crucial 99-run partnership for the fourth wicket with skipper Shai Hope, who contributed 86 runs from 88 balls, before being caught by Jaker Ali at midwicket off Mehidy Hasan Miraz's bowling.Rutherford then collaborated with Justin Greaves (41 not out) in a 95-run stand for the sixth wicket, steering West Indies towards victory.""I think he's really improved his batting,"" said Hope of his match-winner.""We ask for consistency, we always speak about it, and he's showing that.

Rohit Sharma press conference after loss in Adelaide Test vs Australia

ADELAIDE: Is this the point where the India-Australia series takes an ugly turn? The send-off Mohammed Siraj gave Travis Head after dismissing him on the second day seems to have galvanized both the Aussie media and public, especially after Head's assertion that he had merely said ""well bowled"" to the India pacer before the ugly exchange of words, some of which was caught on the broadcast.Siraj's animated celebration while pointing Head to the Aussie dressing room seems to have made him the object of a witch-hunt here, with boos ringing out at the ground whenever he is in action and talking heads on social media and TV screens seemingly obsessed with it.Ravi Shastri, while commentating on Fox Sports, wryly noted how ""Siraj is the crowd favourite"", while both captains were inundated with queries on the issue, putting Australia's fine win in the shade.Siraj tried to clear the air but added more fuel to the fire, asserting that Head had lied during his media interaction on Saturday. ""It was a battle going on with Head and he batted really well,"" Siraj told former India spinner Harbhajan Singh — himself in the centre of the ‘Monkeygate' affair involving Andrew Symonds in 2008 — during an interaction on Star Sports Hindi.""When you get hit for six off a good ball, it fires you up. When I bowled him, I just celebrated, and he abused me. You saw that on TV too. I didn't say anything to him at the start. What he said in the press conference was a lie, that he said ‘well bowled' to me.""The scale of the controversy blew up in the faces of skippers Rohit Sharma and Pat Cummins after the game and both stood by their players. ""I was standing at slip, I don't know exactly what was said,"" Rohit said, ""When India and Australia play, these things happen. He (Siraj) got the wicket and celebrated it. There were a few words exchanged. Siraj likes to get into the battle, it gives him success. It's my job to back that aggression but there is a fine line. One or two words here and there don't make a huge difference.""Cummins harped on similar lines but said he wouldn't try to stop the players from fronting for themselves. ""You let the boys be themselves. Travis is the vice captain, so he's a big boy. He can talk for himself. It's heated. It's a big series. There's a lot riding on it. I think the umpire stepped in pretty quickly. They (India) can do what they want. I'm more worried about our boys,"" Cummins said.",Mohammed Siraj and Travis Head involved in ugly exchange of words.

India vs Australia: How pink ball is different

NEW DELHI: After India's lacklustre performance in Adelaide, cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar expressed his disappointment, criticising the team's approach and preparation.Australia secured a resounding 10-wicket victory over India in the second Test, leveling the five-match series at 1-1. Delivering a commanding performance, the visitors wrapped up the pink-ball Test in just two-and-a-half days, showcasing their dominance and leaving India with much to ponder.Gavaskar candidly highlighted the need for focus and commitment, urging the players to prioritise their cricketing responsibilities. India's defeat raised questions about their strategy, mindset, and adaptability in challenging conditions.Gavaskar's pointed remarks serve as a wake-up call for the team to regroup, reassess, and deliver the performances expected at the international level.“Look at the remainder of the series as a three-match series. Forget that it's a five-match series. What I would like the Indian team to do is use the next couple of days as practice. You can't be sitting in your hotel rooms because you have come here to play cricket. You don't have to practice the whole day, you can practice a session in the morning or afternoon, but don't waste the two days. You would've been here playing a Test if it went for five days,”Gavaskar told Star Sports.The former India captain further stressed that the responsibility of organising additional practice sessions should rest entirely with the captain and coach.“You have to give yourself a chance to get into rhythm. You haven't got runs, your bowlers haven't got rhythm. The optional practice should only be dependent on the captain and coach. The coach can say, ‘hey, you got 150 or you bowled 40 overs in the match, you don’t need to come to practice'. They should be the one giving the options, not the players. If it is left to the players, they will certainly say, ‘no, I will be staying in my room’,” said Gavaskar.“That's not what Indian cricket is. It's an honour, privilege to be playing for India, and I counted the number of days they would be here; 57 days is what they will be here for. 25 days for five Tests, two days for PM's XI match, so they got 30 days of off. They got one extra day in Perth, they are getting two days here. So my request to them is to please come here and practice.”",India lost the second Test against Australia by 10 wickets in Adelaide. Sunil Gavaskar criticised the team's approach and preparation. The former India captain urged the players to prioritise their cricketing responsibilities.

As it Happened:

NEW DELHI: In a significant advancement towards potentially becoming the youngest world chess champion , Grandmaster D Gukesh of India defeated Ding Liren from China in the 11th Game of the World Chess Championship on Sunday.This victory places Gukesh in the lead with a score of 6-5. This is the first time Gukesh has led in this match, with only three games remaining.Historically, no challenger in modern chess has ever secured a win after being tied 5-5 after the 10th game, putting Gukesh in a favourable position.For Liren, the only consolation could be his victory in the 12th game of the previous World Championship match against Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia.The game began with Gukesh's Knight move, which was met with a surprising reverse Benoni opening by Liren, suggesting an over-the-board decision rather than a planned one.Gukesh quickly gained a significant time advantage on the clock, making it challenging for Liren to recover in such a crucial game.Despite initial concerns about Liren's opening, the Chinese player capitalized on Gukesh's erroneous plan in the early middle game, temporarily turning the tables. However, Liren missed a simple manoeuvre that could have given him a slight advantage, and Gukesh responded with a spectacular pawn sacrifice on the queen side, creating space for his rooks.As Gukesh doubled his rooks on the file, exerting pressure, Liren made a critical blunder, leaving him dejected and Gukesh with a winning move.With two games remaining as White, Liren has the best chance to stage a comeback, while Gukesh needs only three draws to secure his maiden world championship title. The stage is set for an exciting conclusion to this high-stakes chess battle.","D Gukesh of India defeated Ding Liren from China in the 11th Game of the World Chess Championship on Sunday.

ADELAIDE: India's bowling issues in the pink-ball Test have reignited talk of flying in veteran pacer Mohammed Shami , who has just recovered from a prolonged year-long absence following ankle surgery and played in a few domestic games.""Definitely that door is very much open,"" captain Rohit Sharma said when asked about the prospect of roping in Shami for the remaining Tests of the series. Rohit, though, added a rider.""We're just monitoring him because while playing Syed Mushtaq Ali , he again got some swelling in his knee, which obviously hampers his preparation to come and play a Test match. We want to be very, very careful. We don't want to bring him into a situation where he plays and then pulls up sore or something happens.""Shami recently played for Bengal in a Ranji Trophy game against MP in Indore in which he bowled 43.2 overs across two innings and picked up seven wickets. Shami has also played seven games in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s and bowled 27.3 overs.However, he hasn't played at the international level since the 50-over World Cup at home in Nov 2023. He had surgery on the ankle the following Feb but there were several setbacks in the recovery process.""We want to be more than 100% sure with Shami, because it's been such a long time that he hasn't played any cricket. We don't want to put pressure on him to come here and do the job for the team. There are some professionals (the BCCI's medical team) who're monitoring him.""We'll take the call based on what those guys feel there. They're the ones watching him every game, how he pulls up after the game after bowling four overs, after standing for 20 overs.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Aakash Chopra provided a critical analysis of India's dismal performance in the second Test against Australia in Adelaide.Reflecting on India’s collapse, Chopra pinpointed batting failures as the crux of the problem, emphasizing the lack of resolve and application from the Indian batters.His remarks came after India folded twice in the Test, managing just 180 in the first innings and a paltry 175 in the second, leaving the visitors with no cushion against a formidable Australian bowling attack.Chopra underlined that the decision to bat first was sound given the conditions, but the execution left much to be desired. ""Where did we go wrong? It's a big question. The truth is that it was a batting failure, not once but twice. The decision to bat first was absolutely right. In the first innings when you got out for 180, you could have said that it happens. However, the second innings, the pitch had become flat now,"" he said on his YouTube channel.One of Chopra’s main observations was the lack of intent and patience from Indian batters to occupy the crease.There was some help in the first innings for sure. If you are not going to bat 80 overs across two innings in a Test match, that is the problem. There is not one person in the team who said he would play 80-100 balls. Not a single player played 50 balls. We are talking about 50 runs but no one played 50 balls,"" he pointed out.Despite high expectations from stalwarts like Virat Kohli Rishabh Pant , and Rohit Sharma , no one managed to shoulder the responsibility. ""It wasn't a pitch where you couldn't have played 50 balls. It wasn't a pitch where you couldn't have survived for a slightly longer time. You have to bat at least one session without losing a wicket,"" he concluded.""In the end, the Indian batting frailties were exposed once again. When wickets fall with the new ball, Virat Kohli is at No. 4, you are expecting a lot from Rishabh Pant but he hasn't played a big knock so far in this series, and Rohit Sharma at No. 6, it's not looking good. Our batting has let us down. That is the one big reason for India's loss at Adelaide.""Eyeing a strong comeback in the five-match series, India will face Australia in the third Test at The Gabba in Brisbane on December 14.","Former Indian cricketer Aakash Chopra provided a critical analysis of India's dismal performance in the second Test against Australia in Adelaide.

NEW DELHI: Skipper Rohit Sharma on Sunday issued a strong message to India’s bowling unit, after the disappointing loss in the pink-ball Test at Adelaide, stressing that Jasprit Bumrah cannot carry the entire burden alone.Speaking candidly, Rohit emphasised the need for collective responsibility from all bowlers. The Indian captain urged the team to step up and support their star pacer, calling for greater contributions from the rest of the bowling attack as Bumrah's exceptional skills can’t be expected to deliver from both ends.India suffered a 10-wicket loss to Australia in the second Test, with Jasprit Bumrah being the lone standout performer during the home team's first innings, claiming a four-wicket haul.""We are not just playing with one bowler. There are other bowlers also who will have to take responsibility and get the job done for the team, be it (Mohammed) Siraj, Harshit Rana , Nitish Reddy , Akash Deep or Prasidh (Krishna),"" skipper Rohit said at the post-match presser, sending a loud and clear message for his bowling unit.The captain acknowledges the inexperience in the lineup but believes the players will gain confidence and improve over time.""These bowlers have just arrived in Test cricket , it's important to give them confidence. Whenever they play a match, it's important to give them confidence. We keep planning and discussing. But you can't expect Bumrah to bowl from both the ends and from morning to evening,"" Rohit said.""It's very important to manage (all) bowlers. We discuss all this with each other. We talk to the bowler and then we make the decisions.""Rohit stated that he takes the workload management of bowlers very seriously, emphasising its importance for their long-term success and well-being.""I speak with him (Bumrah) whenever he finishes a spell. I enquire about how his body is feeling, is he (feeling) fresh or not? It's a five-match series, we want Bumrah to play all the matches and remain fresh,"" Rohit said.Young Harshit Rana was hammered for 86 runs in just 16 overs, but the skipper was adamant about not making the two-Test youngster the scapegoat for India’s comprehensive defeat in Adelaide.""Rana didn't do anything wrong in the first Test. He did very well. He gave the team crucial breakthroughs when they were needed. I believe that if someone hasn't done anything wrong, he cannot be left out without a reason because then what confidence does the team get?""It happens, sometimes the team doesn't get what it wants. He came up against a good batsman who put pressure on him. But he has a heart and a passion so we should back such (qualities in a player),"" Rohit said.""The player might think that you give me one match but leave me out in the next. This is not good for any player or any team, that's what I think. We should assess what the situation is and how helpful the conditions are,"" he explained.While Rohit emphasised that he doesn't want to judge Rana based on just one game, he made it clear that if a change is necessary, it will be made for the benefit of the team.""But judging someone after one match is not the right thing. We always keep (all) options open for any player to play since we have to win a Test match. If we must make such changes to win a Test, we will do that.""","India suffered a 10-wicket loss to Australia in the second Test at Adelaide.

NEW DELHI: Former South African cricketer AB de Villiers weighed in on the Mohammed Siraj-Travis Head verbal spat during the Adelaide Test , stating while such on-field exchanges are part of the game, it is important to maintain respect and ensure they don’t escalate beyond acceptable limits.The confrontation began when Siraj cleaned up Head with an exceptional yorker on the first day of the pink-ball Test . Head asserted he had simply acknowledged the delivery with 'well bowled', but Siraj's enthusiastic celebration and subsequent dismissal of Head's statement as a 'lie' heightened the friction.The atmosphere remained tense into the following day's play, with Adelaide spectators showing vocal support for their hometown player, Head, while expressing disapproval through booing at the venue.""Maybe questionable giving Head a send-off after he scored a match-winning hundred.

NEW DELHI: Out-of-form New Zealand opener Devon Conway will not participate in the third test versus England at Hamilton, as he awaits the arrival of his first child this week, according to team officials.Conway, who managed a mere 21 runs across four innings during the Black Caps' substantial defeats in the initial two tests, will see Mark Chapman , an uncapped all-rounder, take his position in the squad.""Family comes first in this environment and we're all really excited for Dev and his wife Kim to welcome their first child,"" said coach Gary Stead.""Mark was with the test squad in India recently and returned to the Plunket Shield by scoring an impressive 276 - so it's a good time for him to be joining us.""Conway's unavailability could present Stead an opportunity to include Will Young in the batting order for the final test, scheduled at Seddon Park on Saturday.Young, who accumulated 244 runs and earned Player of the Series honours when New Zealand achieved a remarkable 3-0 victory against India in October and November, lost his spot to Kane Williamson for the England series.Earlier this year, Conway's wife Kim shared her experience of miscarriage on social media, expressing her desire to overcome shame and embarrassment associated with it.""We will have our miracle one day and we will love them with everything,"" she wrote in a post on Instagram.",Devon Conway will miss the third test against England at Hamilton.

'We were not good enough with bat'

ADELAIDE: In keeping with the Sunday spirit here - all business is closed by 5 pm in the Adelaide CBD - India shut shop in the morning session itself on Day Three to hand Australia a 10-wicket win in the second Test.The result was not entirely unexpected coming into this day-night Test , given India's relative inexperience playing pink-ball games, and the victory margin is a fair reflection of Australia's superiority in these conditions.Nevertheless, that this is the shortest completed Test between these two teams in terms of balls - it was all over in 1031 deliveries, beating the Indore record of 1135 balls - indicates India have offered up a perfect case study in how to scramble the winnability of a unit. Their incredible 295-run comeback win in Perth is now history, its first-mover advantage frittered away. The backs are to the wall again in this five-game series.Australia came into this game reviled by their own supporters and a vitriolic media, their captain battling allegations of having 'gone soft'. Pat Cummins rode high on a five-wicket haul in the second innings and some astute marshalling of his superior bowling resources. Scott Boland's entry added punch to the pace lineup. The combative local hero Travis Head scored a game-changing ton. The determined Marnus Labuschagne, who had a point or two of his own to prove, provided the support act. Head's verbal volleying with Mohammed Siraj provided the melodrama.The game lasted only two days and a session but broke attendance records here, with a total of 1,35,012 spectators turning up. Pink-ball games may be short, but they do fill the local coffers.In the other corner, this was Rohit Sharma 's fourth consecutive Test defeat as captain. Coupled with a horror run of personal batting form which seems to be playing on his mind, India have their work cut out heading into the third Test in Brisbane. They have also slipped to No. 3 in the World Test Championship ranks and their dream of qualifying for that WTC final on their own steam now becomes doubly difficult.First, though, there is pride at stake here. The morning began with promises of another Rishabh Pant special, given his audacious attempts to take the fight to the Aussies on the second night. By the time it was all over barely two hours later, many departing Aussie fans - who may have gone berserk at the beer counters in anticipation of an early finish - were hurling the choicest abuses at anyone in an Indian jersey. Pant lasted only till the sixth ball of Mitchell Starc's first over of the day. He gave the second delivery the charge and a wild heave and missed. By the fifth ball, the nerves appeared to be settling, and he resisted poking outside off. The sixth ball was another piece of Starc magic, simply too good for Pant - fuller, angling in and straightening off the seam to kiss the bat's edge and fly to the 'keeper.India knew the game had been lost right there, though Nitish Reddy - who is so far the highest scorer in each of India's completed innings on this tour - hung on grimly, even showcasing his 360-degree strokeplay, but a barrage of short stuff from Cummins had the final say.India lasted only 11.5 overs on the third morning in a second innings lasting 36.5 overs, in which they went at 4.75 runs per over when the need of the hour may have been to wear the bowlers down. That left Australia's openers only 19 runs to chase, and there was to be no further drama.""This week we were back at our best,"" a satisfied Cummins said. ""This is the kind of team that I remember and how we want to play our cricket. It's great to have Travis Head in the side. Every time he walks in, it's like the match is in the balance and in the space of a few sessions he took the game out of their hands.""As for India, Jasprit Bumrah lacked pace support but the immediate concern for Rohit Sharma is the batting unit's fallibility. ""I wouldn't say it's lack of experience with the pink ball (that cost us). When you come to Australia you have to play a pink-ball Test. The best chance of winning here is to put runs on the board. The disappointing bit is that we didn't bat well enough,"" Rohit said.""I wouldn't say I'm worried. If you take the last five or six matches, we haven't batted well enough, but when we play in India the high-scoring games are not going to happen (because of the turning pitches). Abroad, the conditions are there (to bat long). There's been a lot of conversation around that. We want to battle it out, stay out there. Our focus will now be on Brisbane and how we can do things better.""Some of India's batters, incidentally, hit the nets immediately after the game ended.","Australia beat India by 10 wickets in the second Test in Adelaide. The match was all over in 1031 deliveries, beating the Indore record of 1135 balls. Travis Head scored a game-changing ton for the Aussies. It was Rohit Sharma's fourth consecutive Test defeat as captain.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116121169,imgsize-54596,width-400,resizemode-4/116121169.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India's Jay Shah last Sunday took charge as the chairman of the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Ravi Shastri has backed the former BCCI secretary to do wonders at cricket's world governing body.Shah, who was the BCCI secretary for the last five years, last week became the fifth Indian to head the ICC.Shastri said that Shah has the ability to grasp things very quickly and he will pleasantly surprise everyone with his work, with time.The former India head coach pointed out that Shah's stint as BCCI secretary will help a lot in governing things at ICC.""First I will say, Mabruk (congrats in Arabic). Every Indian should feel proud. He is a young man but what I liked about Jay was even when I was the coach, at that time he had just become the BCCI secretary, his ability to grasp things around him. And he did it so quickly. He understood what's needed for the BCCI to grow as a unit. And what I liked best was the way he took everyone along,"" Shastri said in a video posted by the ICC.""He had his finger on the job all the time and I think he'll do wonders even with the ICC. I think a lot of people might be surprised, how can he go so quickly to the ICC? They'll get a pleasant shock when he shows them those coffers of theirs in 2-3 years' time. He has learned very quickly, dealing with the BCCI, that experience will stand with him in good stead going there,"" he added.Shastri also highlighted Shah's concern for the well-being of the cricketers while pointing out that the 36-year-old will take all the board members forward along with him.""What was also good to see was his concern for the well-being of the players. It took him about 6-8 months and that concern was there. I can't say that it was (the case) with all the others, who were there before him. Even in my stint, I didn't see that happening that too often.""Once he's settled into the job, one year down the line, you will see the difference. I don't think he will be fazed. Just like he took the whole board along with him (at BCCI), he'll take all the other ICC members with him,"" he added.Shah was the unanimous choice of ICC's Board of Directors and replaced New Zealand’s Greg Barclay, who didn't wish to continue for a third consecutive term.Before Shah, businessman late Jagmohan Dalmiya, politician Sharad Pawar , lawyer Shashank Manohar and industrialist N Srinivasan had all headed the world cricket body.","Ravi Shastri has backed Jay Shah to do wonders at cricket's world governing body.

Can Shreyas Iyer and Ricky Ponting finally bring PBKS their maiden IPL title?

NEW DELHI: Following India's decisive 122-run loss to Australia in Brisbane, captain Harmanpreet Kaur acknowledged the need for a comprehensive review of their bowling strategies.India's bowling performance was inadequate as Australia posted an enormous 371/8. This stands as the highest total ever conceded by India in women's ODIs, surpassing the previous mark of 338/7, also set by Australia at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium earlier this year.Despite Saima Thakor 's commendable figures of 3-62, India's bowling attack struggled significantly. Centurions Georgia Voll and Ellyse Perry, alongside half-century makers Phoebe Litchfield and Beth Mooney , dominated the Indian bowlers.Notably, leg-spinner Priya Mishra 's figures of 1-88 in ten overs set an unwanted record as the most expensive spell by an Indian bowler in women's ODIs.The target of 372 presented an enormous challenge for India, particularly with Priya Punia unavailable due to injury. Although stand-in opener Richa Ghosh contributed 54 runs and debutant Minnu Mani remained unbeaten on 46, consistent loss of wickets resulted in India being dismissed for 249.“In bowling, we need to go back and think about plans. We expected some more movement but we didn't get that here. We need to bat a bit longer and bat a full 50 overs moving forward. We had a few 40s but couldn't convert it to fifty or hundred,"" said Harmanpreet after the match.""I think we got some partnerships in between despite a big total. Still we had a positive approach, looking for boundaries. But we were short by a few runs. We created a few opportunities with the ball but we couldn't take it. They batted really well, credit to them,” Harmanpreet added.","India's bowling performance was inadequate as Australia posted an enormous 371/8.

Post-match, both players addressed the incident. Head initially expressed disappointment with Siraj's behaviour:

However, Head later clarified to

that the two had resolved their differences on day three:

Head explained their conversation, revealing Siraj had questioned his use of profanity:

Head admitted he could have handled the situation differently:

Star Sports

He disputed Head's account of the incident and accused him of misrepresenting the truth:

Siraj emphasised his respect for the game and his fellow players:

A confrontation between Australian batter Travis Head and Indian bowler Mohammed Siraj occurred during the second Border-Gavaskar Test match at Adelaide. Head had hit Siraj for a four and a six before Siraj bowled him out.Siraj's celebration after dismissing Head, who was leading the Australian scoring, prompted a verbal exchange on the field. Siraj's yorker had broken Head's stumps. He then approached Head, leading to the visible interaction.Head later commented on the exchange, “I said, ‘Well bowled,’ but he thought otherwise when he pointed me to the sheds. Slightly disappointed with the way that transpired. It is what it is. If they want to react like that, and if that’s how they want to represent themselves, then so be it,” Head toldat the end of day two’s play.Siraj gestured dismissively towards the pavilion, prompting a more forceful reply from Head.“I was surprised at the reaction in terms of the situation of the game,” Head said during his post-match press conference.“There was no confrontation leading up to it, and I felt like it was probably a little bit far at the time.I’m disappointed in the reaction that I gave back, but I’m also going to stand up for myself.”""Sweet with it. He came out and just said [it was] a little bit of misunderstanding … I think we'll move on. We've had a great week, so let's not let it ruin it,"" Head said after being named Player of the Match in the 10-wicket win on his home ground.""It was fine. He said, 'Why'd you swear?' I sort of said, 'Look, I didn’t at first … [but] I definitely swore at you the second time round.'""""I probably could have laughed it off and walked off and enjoyed myself. He just said it was a misunderstanding as well, and there were no issues for me. We move on. I'm sweet. It is what it is.""Siraj, speaking to, offered a different perspective on the exchange. He denied saying anything to Head beyond his initial celebration:""I only celebrated at the start. I didn’t say anything to him,"" he said in an interview with the Indian broadcaster, translated from Hindi.""What he said in the press conference wasn’t right. It’s a lie that he only said, 'Well bowled,' to me. It’s there for everyone to see that that’s not what he said to me.""""We respect everyone. It’s not like we disrespect other players. I respect everybody because cricket is a gentleman's game, but what he did wasn’t right. I didn’t like it at all.""Despite the conflicting accounts, Head and Siraj had a brief interaction on day three when Siraj came to bat. Head, fielding at short leg, further clarified his earlier comments before eventually dismissing Siraj with a catch, bringing India’s innings to a close.The incident underscores the intensity and competitive spirit often seen in high-stakes cricket matches.",A confrontation between Travis Head and Mohammed Siraj occurred during the second Border-Gavaskar Test match at Adelaide.

Shah to attend Brisbane Olympic committee meet

Devajit Saikia is all set to take charge as the interim Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) Secretary till the time elections are called for the position.The Secretary position remains vacant after Jay Shah has started his tenure as the International Cricket Council (ICC) Chairman and Saikia, who is currently the Joint Secretary, will take over for the time being.The Indian cricket board needs to hold elections for the Secretary post within 45 days of Shah vacating his office and an announcement of that is likely in the near future.It is understood that the BCCI has had internal discussions already and the new Secretary will be appointed only for a tenure of close to one year as terms of the current office bearers ends in September next year.There could be fresh names in the mix for those elections but for now Saikia is the frontrunner to take over the Secretary office.It is learnt that Shah, the new ICC Chair, will be attending Brisbane Olympic committee meet. He played an important role in cricket’s inclusion in Olympics.Cricket was included in the Olympic programme for Los Angeles 2028 in October 2023. The last time cricket was included at an Olympics was 1900. Cricket is expected to be featured in a six-team T20 style tournament during LA 2028.At the time, Shah had highlighted BCCI's support in taking cricket to the Olympics.""The BCCI has been a staunch supporter of the ICC's efforts to include cricket as an Olympic sport. We are thrilled to witness this momentous occasion, which marks a significant milestone for the sport. Our active participation has been instrumental in promoting the case for cricket's inclusion in the Olympics. This initiative aligns with the idea of India hosting the 2036 Olympics, as envisioned by our Hon'ble Prime Minister,"" Jay Shah said in a statement.""The Indian Cricket Team boasts an unparalleled global fanbase, and their participation in this prestigious quadrennial event will undoubtedly enhance the sport's global stature. Our contributions were pivotal in securing cricket's presence at the Commonwealth Games 2022 in Birmingham and the Asian Games 2022 in Guangzhou, China.""""The inclusion of cricket in the Olympics is set to open new frontiers for the sport, providing unparalleled exposure in untapped global markets. Moreover, we anticipate that this decision will yield significant financial dividends and have a profound positive impact on our sport’s eco-system. It will fuel infrastructural development, intensify competition, foster youth development, and create opportunities for officials, volunteers, and skilled professionals.""",Devajit Saikia set to take charge as interim Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) Secretary till the time elections are called for the position.

NEW DELHI: Former world number one tennis player from Romania Simona Halep has raised concerns about the perceived discrepancies in the treatment of cases involving positive tests for banned substances by the International Tennis Integrity Agency ( ITIA ).Her criticism stems from the recent one-month ban imposed on Iga Swiatek , the current world number two, after testing positive for the heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in an out-of-competition sample.Halep, who returned to tennis in March 2023 after serving a provisional suspension since October 2022 for testing positive for roxadustat at the US Open, believes there is a lack of consistency in the ITIA's approach.She questions the significant difference in the penalties handed out to her and Swiatek, despite the cases occurring around the same time.In her statement, Halep expressed her bewilderment at the disparate treatment and questioned the logical reasoning behind the ITIA's decisions. She accused the organization of attempting to ""destroy"" her career, despite the evidence presented, and claimed to have suffered from the perceived injustice.“I have always believed in good, I have believed in the fairness of this sport, I have believed in kindness,"" Halep wrote on Instagram. “The injustice that was done to me was painful, is painful and maybe will always be painful. How is it possible that in identical cases that happened at about the same time (of the season), ITIA has completely different approaches, to my detriment?”Halep had initially received a four-year ban from the ITIA, which she successfully appealed at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in February 2023.

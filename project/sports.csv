NEW DELHI: Abhishek Sharma rewrote record books with his scintillating knock in the fifth T20I against England at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Sunday.Abhishek hit a brutal 135 to set up a crushing 150-run win over England and seal the series 4-1 and his incredible 54-ball knock, studded with 13 sixes, fired India, who clinched the series in the fourth T20I, to 247/9.On Monday, the Indian cricket board (BCCI) shared a video on X where the opener looked back at his knock and also explained his unique celebration with his index finger and thumb.Abhishek says in the video, ""When I reached a fifty I celebrated in that way, this is love. I really enjoyed my knock because before this, I didn't even have a thirty-run knock to my name in India. I used to think how I would celebrate reaching a hundred but when I reached it, I was totally blank, the emotions that came out were natural.""Abhishek dominated a partnership of 115 for the second wicket with Tilak Varma and raced to his fifty in 17 balls with a six and then reached his second T20 century for India in 37 deliveries, missing the record of Rohit Sharma 's fastest T20I hundred by an Indian by just two deliveries.Abhishek continues in the video, ""I know he (Rohit) holds the record, I know that on my day even if the first ball is there to hit, I will hit and today was my day so I am very grateful. The way Suryakumar Yadav and Gautam Gambhir have supported me, it looks like they have more trust in me than I have in myself. So obviously it is a big motivation and when the captain and the coach say that an aggressive intent should be there, I like it coming from them. With that kind of support, I would say similar days are just around the corner for other youngsters also.""Abhishek was brutal in his knock and, with Tilak Varma (24), took 25 runs from one Jamie Overton over, the pair putting on 115 runs for the second wicket.Abhishek also took two wickets in the only over he bowled with left-arm spin as India bowled out England for 97 for their second biggest T20 victory by runs.Talking about the Wankhede crowd, Abhishek said, ""The crowd here supports India all the time whatever match it is and I would say it's one of my lucky grounds.""India and England now head into three one-day internationals series starting February 6 in Nagpur.The series is a warm-up for the 50-over Champions Trophy starting February 19 in Pakistan and Dubai.",Abhishek Sharma rewrote record books with his scintillating knock in the fifth T20I against England.

Seven times in 15 games while batting first in T20Is, since Gautam Gambhir and Suryakumar Yadav (SKY) combined as coach and captain, India have scored in excess of 200.Yes, the 202, 221 and 287 in Durban, Centurion and Johannesburg respectively had VVS Laxman as coach as Gambhir was in charge of the Test team that was to travel to Australia, but the tactics of going hell for leather from Ball One, had the Gambhir stamp on it.In those games, India have hit 135 fours and 112 sixes.After trouncing England by 150 runs at the Wankhede in the fifth T20I on Sunday to collect a 4-1 series win, Gambhir lauded his players for embracing a high-risk approach.In Pune, in the fourth T20I too, India, despite losing three wickets in the second over, kept attacking and ended with 181. ""That's the kind of T20 cricket we want to play. We don't want to fear losing,"" Gambhir told Star Sports.""We want to play high-risk, high reward cricket. And these guys have adopted that ideology. The ideology of this T20 team is based on selflessness and fearlessness. In the last six months, these guys have done it day in, day out,"" Gambhir added.The coach said he was willing to accept the odd batting blow out. ""We want to try and get to 250-260 regularly. And in trying to do that, there'll be games where we'll get bundled out for 120-130. That is what T20 cricket is all about. Unless you don't play that high-risk cricket, you won't get those big rewards. Come those big tournaments, we want to continue playing this way and don't want to fear losing.""SKY too felt that batting with intent is the only way out. ""This is what we've spoken about. To play the brand of cricket we want to play and stick to it irrespective of what's going to happen. It is a high-risk, high-reward game. But we'll continue doing what works for us.""",India have scored in excess of 200 seven times in 15 games while batting first in T20Is.

How India T20 opener

- who scored a blazing 54-ball 135 against England at

Wankhede Stadium

on Sunday - found his zone

MUMBAI: Nairobi. 1996. Afridi. 37-ball 100. Whenever you thought about fast tons, only the charismatic Pathan's blitz vs Sri Lanka flashed before your eyes. Even though the knock wasn't televised in India. Even though AB de Villiers bettered it by six balls in 2015.Now, Indian fans too can lay claim to another special 37-ball 100 that deserves its place in folklore for the quality of the attack it came against and the purity of the ball striking. Abhishek Sharma's 54-ball 135 vs England in the fifth T20I at Wankhede Stadium on Sunday.Mumbai's throbbing cricketing epicentre was as loud as a Coldplay concert as it screamed in chorus, ""Abhi-Shek, Abhi-Shek"" to endorse the above sentiment.While he stopped enroute to the dug-out, turned around and acknowledged the crowd, after the game, he would have been eager to log in to his social media feed to find appreciation from his mentor, Yuvraj Singh And there it was. ""Well played @IamAbhiSharma4! That's where I want to see you! Proud of you,"" read the post by Yuvraj on 'X'.Like father Yograj, Yuvraj has showered Abhishek with some tough love since taking him under his wing post the pandemic. He has told the media and fans not to expect him to don India colours after just one brilliant season in IPL or Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT).While training him in different cities of India at God-forsaken hours on different pitches and simulating varied match situations, Yuvraj drilled it into Abhishek's head that he must bat deep and not be satisfied by pretty 30s and 40s.""Probably he should be happy today. He's always wanted me to bat into the 15th, and 20th over. I've tried to implement that,"" said Abhishek after the game.The transformation in Abhishek's batting where he married carnage and consistency, despite playing a high-risk, high reward game, came since the start of the Syed Mushtaq Ali 2023-2024 tournament where he was second on the run-scoring charts with 485 runs at a strike rate of 192.46 in Punjab's victorious campaign.Chats and net sessions with legendary West Indian Brian Lara, who was coach of the Sunrisers Hyderabad during the 2023 IPL, helped too. ""I worked hard ahead of that season and when I saw the results, I thought I should back myself and express myself,"" Abhishek told reporters.""I practised a lot of match scenarios in open nets. Lara had told me one thing - just play your shots but make sure that you don't get out. I had that in mind. I felt I could hit shots off the first or second ball as well. When you are young, you don't explore much, but I did that and realised I could play with more intent and help the team,"" he added.Intent is something Abhishek thrives on. He scored 255 runs in the SMAT this season at a strike-rate of 216 including a 28-ball ton. In last-year's IPL, opening with one of his idols, Travis Head , he slammed 484 runs at a strike-rate of 204.21. In 17 games for India, his 535 runs have come @193.84.Did the fastest 100 by an Indian record enter his head as he was on 94 off 32 and hitting sixes for fun? ""I was in a zone where I was just reacting to the ball. I didn't even know my score,"" Abhishek explained and credited Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav for the ton. ""I just asked Surya paaji' what do you think?'. He said 'A wicket has just fallen. You can take a couple of balls.' That helped. I didn't realise I was going to hit the fastest hundred.""India play 13 more T20Is this year, but none before Aug. Abhishek will have competition for the opening slot from his India U-19 and Punjab teammate Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal.How timely was this ton then? Abhishek's response was politically correct. ""There has never been competition among us - we are playing together since U-16s.There was just one dream - to play for India. The three of us are playing now. There is no better feeling.""",Abhishek Sharma scored 54-ball 135 against England at Wankhede Stadium. India T20 opener has scored 535 runs in 17 games for India. He scored 255 runs in the SMAT this season at a strike-rate of 216 including a 28-ball ton.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117899139,imgsize-72570,width-400,resizemode-4/117899139.jpg"

I would say it was all possible because of the efforts I put in the practice, the backing I got from the coaches and the captain when I was not getting the runs or not bowling well,"" Abhishek said in the post-match press meet.""All these things calculate (work out well) at the end and I had the belief that on my day, I will play an innings like this,"" he said.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Abhishek said he enjoyed using the pace of the England pacers as well as hitting their leg-spinner Adil Rashid for a cumulative 13 sixes.""I do not remember half of them now to be honest,"" he quipped.""But the way I used the pace of the bowlers over covers or even against Adil Rashid… it felt good.

NEW DELHI: India's newest power-hitter, Abhishek Sharma , has learned early on that self-belief and fearlessness are crucial to increasing the likelihood of a favorable outcome in a sport as unpredictable as T20 cricket , where a batter is destined for more failures than successes.The Punjab batsman hasn't been on the international scene for a full year yet, but he came with great potential in domestic cricket, including a 2024 IPL title with Sunrisers Hyderabad .However, Abhishek, who is only 24, has started to threaten records that others took years to accomplish.In just his second match, he achieved his first T20I century, which was the third-fastest for any Indian at 46 balls. His second T20I century against England on Sunday was the second-fastest of any Indian (37 balls).He also claimed the joint-fastest century for any Indian in the coveted Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy with a brilliant 28-ball century.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy One could wonder, ""What is the secret to such towering success at such a young age?"" Abhishek, who grew up playing in the opening slot for Punjab with Shubman Gill, has an easy response.It's difficult to overlook Yuvraj Singh 's influence on Abhishek's success, but to his credit, he has returned the favor on the field by doing all the legendary Indian all-rounder has asked him to do during their innumerable sessions in various setups over the past few years.""The focus was very much clear (during practice). Yuvi Paaji put all these things in my mind three or four years back,"" Abhishek told the media after his 54-ball 135 (13x6s, 7x4s) became the highest individual total by an Indian in T20Is, surpassing his friend Gill (126 off 63 balls in 2023).""Yuvi paaji was the one to believe in me, and when someone like Yuvraj Singh is telling you that you are going to play for the country and you are going to win the games, obviously you try to think that 'okay I will play for India and I will do my best',"" he said.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 ""They (Yuvraj and Punjab coach Wasim Jaffer) have played a major role in my cricketing career and they are going to continue doing that. But as I have said before, it is all because of him (Yuvraj),"" he said.A young cricket player's self-doubt and concerns are normal, but Abhishek's success story shows that trusting well-wishers can help you deal with those issues. The Indian team management is another component of this support system.""Because of the way he (Yuvraj) has treated me in the past and (during) every innings, he is someone who is always there for me,"" said Abhishek, who made 484 runs in 16 IPL matches in 2024 at a strike rate of 204.21 with three fifties.""He is the one guy I have always listened to and I think he knows better than me so I believe that,"" he added.According to Abhishek, it also helps that the team management gave him the confidence to give it his all and not worry about failing.""I didn't do well in few matches before this series and when your captain and coach tell you that 'you have to play like this and we are backing you, and we will be there for you always', as a youngster, that is the biggest motivation, I would say,"" he said.""In South Africa, I remember Hardik (Pandya) Paaji and Surya (Suryakumar Yadav) Paaji telling me that you will 100 per cent make some runs, but just believe in yourself'.""""In this series, obviously, Gauti ( Gautam Gambhir ) Paaji came back and then Surya Paaji. I feel really grateful that the way they believe in me. That's not normal for any player because that's the biggest motivation I would say for any young cricketer,"" he said.Then there was Brian Lara , who thinks highly of him and gave him a suggestion that significantly altered his strategy. He scored 485 runs at 48.50 in 10 games, including two hundreds and three fifties, to dominate the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy 2023-24. His runs came at a strike rate of 192.46.""I practiced a lot of match scenarios. I did a lot of open nets. But there was one thing in my mind that Brian Lara had (once) told me, 'play your shots but make sure you don't get out'.""I used to be careful that I won't get out to any bowler. That really helped me in these few years,"" he said.Even though he has demonstrated remarkable potential in a very unpredictable format, Abhishek is aware of his potential to set or shatter records, like Yuvraj's six sixes in an over.""I don't think that record can be broken anytime soon. I don't know if it can be broken at all. But if you consciously think about it while going in, then it won't happen,"" he said.""I think when you play your normal game, there are situations where you are in a zone and able to execute. I had asked Yuvi Paaji as well. He did not have any such plan of hitting six sixes but it happens when you are on the spot in such a zone,"" Abhishek added.","India's newest power-hitter, Abhishek Sharma, has learned early on that self- belief and fearlessness are crucial to increasing the likelihood of a favorable outcome.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

Astrologer Greenstone Lobo has weighed in on India’s chances of winning the 2025 Champions Trophy , stating that the team is a strong contender, but there are challenges ahead, with some international captains posing a significant threat.Lobo delves into the horoscopes of key figures, including India’s captain Rohit Sharma and coach Gautam Gambhir, to predict the outcome. Starting with Rohit Sharma, Lobo notes that while Rohit’s chart shows some remarkable planetary alignments, it also reflects a history of both triumphs and setbacks.“Rohit Sharma has a very interesting horoscope. His Uranus and Neptune are exalted, which brings immense potential, but his Pluto is debilitated, creating a dichotomy of successes and failures,"" Lobo explains. This astrological tug-of-war has seen Rohit lead India to major victories, such as winning the 2024 T20 World Cup, but also disappointing losses like the 2023 World Cup final and India’s historic 3-0 defeat to New Zealand in the Test series.Looking at the global landscape, Lobo identifies several potential threats to India’s Champions Trophy aspirations. Among them is Pat Cummins, Australia’s captain, whose horoscope shows strong signs of success, given his impressive career and team’s past victories. “Pat Cummins’ chart is phenomenal. His team has diluted their karmic energy through multiple tournament wins, making them formidable contenders,” he says.However, Lobo sees a window of opportunity for India to seize the title. He compares Rohit to footballing legends like Leo Messi, who achieved success later in his career after many tournament wins with his club. “Rohit’s karmic energy has been diluted due to numerous club victories like his five IPL titles. But this Champions Trophy is not as significant as a World Cup, making it more likely for Rohit to capture this title,"" Lobo suggests.Lobo also highlights that Rohit’s horoscope is currently aligned in a way that strengthens India’s chances, as Uranus is transiting at the same degree as it was at the time of his birth, suggesting a peak opportunity to beat rivals and win. “This alignment shows that India has the highest chances to win the Champions Trophy,” he concludes.While the competition will be fierce, Lobo’s astrological insight points to India having a solid shot, with the final stages of the tournament likely to reveal more about their fate.","Astrologer Greenstone Lobo has weighed in on India's chances of winning the 2025 Champions Trophy. Lobo delves into the horoscopes of key figures, including India’s captain Rohit Sharma and coach Gautam Gambhir.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117878811,imgsize-29306,width-400,resizemode-4/117878811.jpg"
Why Viswanathan Anand withdrew from Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Tour,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/exclusive-why-viswanathan-anand-withdrew-from-freestyle-chess-grand-slam-tour/articleshow/117879362.cms,"Viswanathan Anand (PTI Photo)

NEW DELHI: Chess legend Viswanathan Anand ’s unexpected withdrawal from the upcoming Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Tour has undoubtedly raised eyebrows across the global chess community.Initially scheduled to take part in the season-opening event in Germany, Anand's decision to pull out has sparked questions, especially amid the tensions between FIDE , the global governing body for chess, and the organisers of the Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Tour.In an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com, Freestyle Chess co-founder Jan Henric Buettner revealed what led to the five-time world champion’s decision to step away from the event.“It was my idea to invite him in the first place because I thought it was a great opportunity,” Buettner told TimesofIndia.com. “I gave him a wild card for Germany, and he accepted very happily. I also met him personally in London for lunch, and we had very good communication. We know each other quite well. He's a very, very nice person.”Despite this strong rapport, Anand’s recent position as Deputy President of FIDE seems to have complicated matters. “But then, for some reason, he chose to become the FIDE Vice President . I don't know if it's the wisest decision—having an official role in FIDE,” Buettner explained. “But Anand has made it, so now he is also standing for the FIDE position.""As It Happened: Tata Steel Chess 2025 Highlights Buettner also pointed to the friction between Anand and current World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen , particularly following the events that transpired in New York.In the absence of the FIDE president Arkady Dvorkovich, Carlsen criticised Anand following the jeans controversy at the FIDE World Rapid and Blitz Championships, publicly stating that the Indian GM was unfit for the FIDE job.“What happened in New York was that he saw it wasn't so fortunate when he was in charge because Arkady was not there,"" Buettner stated. “We had this jeans issue, which led to Magnus not saying very nice things about him.”After these tensions, the organisers reached out to Anand in an attempt to resolve matters. “We communicated with him and asked, 'What if Magnus apologises for his comments?' But in the end, he said he felt more comfortable not participating,” Buettner said. “All I'm saying is that all of these things might have factored into Vishy’s decision not to participate. And I respect that. I respect that totally.""The 2025 Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Tour is set to begin in Germany on February 7, with the world’s top ten players, including Carlsen, Hikaru Nakamura , Fabiano Caruana, and D Gukesh , taking part. Javokhir Sindarov has been roped in for Anand's replacement for the Germany leg. The tournament will then continue in Paris (April 8-15), New York (July 17-24), and, for now, New Delhi (September 17-24), before concluding in Cape Town (December 5-12).However, TimesofIndia.com also reported that the New Delhi leg might be shifted to another location due to a lack of investor interest in India . For now, though, New Delhi remains listed as a placeholder on the official website.The tournament organisers aim to make their Cape Town leg a world championship of freestyle chess, but FIDE is not yet on board. TimesofIndia.com has learnt that both parties are in discussions over the use of the term ""World Championship"" for the grand finale, with hopes of reaching a consensus before the December leg of the tour.",Viswanathan Anand has pulled out of the 2025 Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Tour. The five-time world champion was scheduled to take part in the season-opening event in Germany. Anand's decision to pull out has sparked questions amid the tensions between FIDE and the organisers of the tour.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117879580,imgsize-32524,width-400,resizemode-4/117879580.jpg"

3. Jey Uso’s possible opponent for WrestleMania 41



2. Roman Reigns & Seth Rollins’ feud begins



1. Charlotte Flair picks her opponent



The trajectory of the WWE landscape has drastically changed following the aftermath of the Royal Rumble event with new challenges, feuds and major things to expect on the upcoming RAW and SmackDown.The 2025 Royal Rumble proved to be one of the spectacular editions of the show with memorable moments and highlights, kicking off the road to WrestleMania 41. The event saw Charlotte Flair and Jey Uso punching their ticket for a main event title match at WrestleMania.Furthermore, the Royal Rumble also saw some unexpected returns, heated moments and jaw-dropping matches that have shaped the road to WrestleMania 41 with major things to expect on the first RAW and SmackDown after the show in Lucas Oil Stadium.One of the biggest reactions at the Royal Rumble 2025 event was garnered by the return of Alexa Bliss. After multiple theories that stated that she would not be coming back, Bliss received a huge ovation upon her comeback. Despite that, she lasted only 11 minutes in the match and was eliminated by Liv Morgan. This could potentially be the start of her first feud after coming back on the RAW after Royal Rumble, leading up to a match with the former WWE Women’s World Champion.Jey Uso reached the pinnacle of his career so far by last eliminating John Cena in the Men’s Royal Rumble to win the match. Following that, Jey made it clear that he was going to challenge for the World Heavyweight Championship, currently held by Gunther. However, with the Elimination Chamber event coming up, there could be a chance that Gunther might defend his title in the match, leading to speculations on other competitors being Uso’s WrestleMania opponents.As witnessed, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns had a cinematic moment in the Royal Rumble match last week. Moreover, The Visionary went berserk and stomped Reigns’ head multiple times, leaving him on the floor. This could have been the seeds planted for a possible Mania showdown in Las Vegas, with the feud kicking off and taking shape on the upcoming RAW and SmackDown.Charlotte Flair made a triumphant return to WWE from her injury by winning the 2025 Women’s Royal Rumble match. The following SmackDown could see her choose her WrestleMania 41 opponent. According to previous reports, The Queen could pick current WWE Women’s Champion, Tiffany Stratton, who has cited Flair as the reason for joining wrestling giving a huge background to the feud for The Show of Shows.Also read: WWE Royal Rumble 2025: 3 Best and 3 Worst Things of the Women's Royal Rumble Match","The 2025 Royal Rumble proved to be one of the spectacular editions of the show with memorable moments and highlights.

NEW DELHI: India's head coach, Gautam Gambhir , praised his team for using ""high-risk, high-reward cricket"" to win the series against England 4-1 while laying out the plan to routinely score 250-plus runs in Twenty20 Internationals.The previous three Twenty20 Internationals between India and England demonstrated the country's philosophy of playing aggressive cricket regardless of the circumstances.England pacer Saqib Mahmood destroyed India in Pune by taking three wickets and adding a maiden in the second over.India's batsmen maintained the pressure and assaulted the English bowlers to finish their innings with a valiant score of 181/9, which was too much for the tourists to handle.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Despite wickets falling from the other end on Sunday in Mumbai, Abhishek Sharma went all guns blazing, leading the hosts to a record-breaking 247/9, which is India's fourth-highest total in the format.""That's the kind of T20 cricket we want to play. We don't want to fear losing a game of cricket. We want to play high-risk, high-reward cricket and these guys have adopted that ideology, that policy really well. And I think the ideology of this T20 team is based on selflessness and fearlessness. And I think in the last six months, these guys have done it day in, day out,"" Gambhir told the host broadcaster.""We want to try and get to 250-260 regularly. And in trying to do that, there'll be games where we'll get bundled out for 120-130. And that is what T20 cricket is all about. And unless and until you don't play that high-risk cricket, you won't get those big rewards as well. Most importantly, I think we're on the right track. Come those big tournaments, we want to still continue playing this way, and we don't want to fear losing anything,"" he added.The failure of England to understand Varun Chakravarthy 's spin was a major factor in India's victory. The English batsmen were still baffled by the Indian mystery spinner.With a staggering 14 wickets at an average of 9.85 and an economy rate of 7.66, he concluded the series at the top of the wicket-taking rankings.""I think his transformation from IPL to international T20 cricket has been phenomenal. And this series was probably the benchmark as well because England is a high-quality side. They've got some really quality cricketers and the kind of surfaces we've played on - I think they were fantastic batting wickets, and the way he's bowled those tough overs has been phenomenal,"" Gambhir said of Varun.","India's head coach, Gautam Gambhir, praised his team for using ""high-risk, high- reward cricket"" to win the series against England 4-1.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

NEW DELHI: Star batter Travis Head was on Monday honoured with the prestigious Allan Border Medal for Australia’s top male cricketer, while Annabel Sutherland claimed the Belinda Clark Medal at the Australian Cricket Awards in Melbourne on Monday.Head, who enjoyed a stellar year across all three formats, amassed 1,427 runs during the voting period and secured 208 votes, surpassing Josh Hazlewood (158 votes) and Pat Cummins (147 votes) to claim the top prize.""Pretty hard to believe. It’s been a great year. I’m pleased to have played my role and fortunate to have featured in all formats. It’s a nice accomplishment, and I’ll enjoy it,"" Head said in a recorded message from Galle.The 31-year-old also took home the Men’s ODI Player of the Year award despite playing only five of Australia’s 11 ODIs during the eligibility period. His standout performance, an unbeaten 154 against England at Trent Bridge, helped him edge past Alex Carey, Steve Smith, and Xavier Bartlett for the honor. Additionally, he finished runner-up in the Test and T20 Player of the Year categories.For Sutherland, this was her first Australian Cricket Award, coming just days after her maiden Test century at the MCG, where she became the first woman to achieve the feat at the iconic venue.The 23-year-old all-rounder kicked off the 12-month voting period with a remarkable 210 against South Africa at the WACA and later scored her third Test century — a magnificent 163 in the Ashes. She secured 168 votes, finishing ahead of Ashleigh Gardner (143 votes) and Beth Mooney (115 votes).""Pretty surreal. Winning an award named after Belinda Clark is truly special,"" Sutherland said.Josh Hazlewood clinched his first-ever Men’s Test Player of the Year award, claiming 30 wickets at an average of 13.16 against the West Indies, New Zealand, and India.Sam Konstas, the 19-year-old sensation who impressed on his debut in the Boxing Day Test against India, was named Young Cricketer of the Year.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

NEW DELHI: Falcon Risers Hyderabad delivered a commanding performance to secure their fourth win in ISPL Season 2 , crushing Srinagar by nine wickets at the Dadoji Kondadev Stadium in Thane on Sunday.A disciplined bowling display by Parveen Kumar set the tone, restricting Srinagar to a paltry 62/8 before Krishna Satpute ’s explosive knock sealed the chase in just 5.2 overs.Parveen, inspired by Mitchell Starc, has spent seven years perfecting his craft in tennis-ball cricket , juggling odd jobs along the way before making his mark in local leagues. His selection in ISPL Season 2 not only provided him financial stability but also a platform to showcase his talent.On Sunday, he produced his finest spell of the tournament, dismantling Srinagar’s top order with figures of 4/13 in two overs. His crucial wicket of Sagar Ali — Srinagar’s only batter who looked comfortable — highlighted his impact.Despite nursing a groin injury, Parveen displayed remarkable resilience, emerging as the season’s leading wicket-taker with 10 scalps in five matches at an economy of 7.00.""This is the best spell of my career so far, and I owe it all to my coaches. I just followed their instructions and focused on restricting runs. Taking four wickets, especially Sagar Ali’s, was crucial for our team. Despite the injury, I knew I had a job to do, and I feel I could have bowled even better if fully fit. I dedicate this award to the coaching staff, whose preparation and guidance have been invaluable,"" said Parveen on his match-winning spellParveen’s journey has been anything but easy. Raised in Haryana, he was forced to quit school after the second standard to support his family, working multiple jobs from a young age.Losing his mother a decade ago and his father in 2021 only strengthened his determination to chase his dream. Discovering his passion for cricket in 2018, he pursued it relentlessly, and now, his hard work is paying off.With Hyderabad chasing a modest target, Krishna turned the game into a spectacle, smashing an unbeaten 46 off just 16 balls. His innings featured five towering sixes and two boundaries, ensuring Hyderabad raced to victory in record time.""I just played my natural game and backed myself to go big. We wanted to finish the chase quickly and keep our net run rate high. The team’s energy is fantastic, and we’re only getting stronger with every match,"" said Krishna on his aggressive approachWith this resounding victory, Hyderabad moved to second place on the points table, boasting the best net run rate (2.283) in the league.

NEW DELHI: Spanish women's national team forward Jenni Hermoso testified on Monday at the trial of Luis Rubiales , the former president of the Spanish Football Federation .The trial revolves around an incident that occurred during the 2023 Women's World Cup final presentation ceremony, where Rubiales kissed Hermoso without her consent.In her testimony, Hermoso stated that she did not consent to the kiss and felt disrespected by Rubiales's actions. “I felt disrespected,” Hermoso said. It ""stained one of the happiest days of my life.”She also revealed that she felt coerced to publicly exonerate Rubiales after the incident, but she refused to do so.Rubiales, who was present in the Madrid High Court, is facing charges of sexual assault and attempting to coerce Hermoso and others to publicly support him. He has denied the charges, claiming that the kiss was consensual and occurred in a ""moment of jubilation"".However, Hermoso firmly stated that Rubiales did not ask for her consent before kissing her.The incident sparked outrage in Spain and beyond, highlighting the prevalence of sexism in sports and society. Facing immense pressure, Rubiales resigned three weeks after the incident and was banned by FIFA for three years. He had previously claimed to be the victim of a ""witch hunt"" by ""false feminists"".Prosecutors, Hermoso, and the Spain players' association are seeking a prison sentence of two and a half years for Rubiales, a payment of 50,000 euros ($51,800) for damages, and a ban from working as a sports official.Hermoso celebrated the World Cup victory with her teammates after the kiss, but she clarified that she chose to celebrate the trophy win like any footballer would, as it was an important moment for her.The trial is expected to last at least 10 days, with nearly 20 witnesses expected to testify, including Spain's men's national coach Luis de la Fuente and some of Hermoso's teammates, such as former world player of the year Alexia Putellas.In addition to Rubiales, former Spain women's national coach Jorge Vilda, former sports director of the Spain men's team Albert Luque, and the federation's former head of marketing, Rubén Rivera, are also on trial. They are accused of allegedly pressuring Hermoso to defend Rubiales publicly in a statement after the incident, which she refused to do.Hermoso expressed that her life was put on standby after the incident and the ensuing controversy, and she was able to escape the spotlight by playing for a club in Mexico. The incident overshadowed Spain's first Women's World Cup triumph and triggered protests and widespread condemnation.","Spanish women's national team forward Jenni Hermoso testified on Monday at the trial of Luis Rubiales.

Five-star Arsenal crush woeful Manchester City to keep title bid alive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/five-star-arsenal-crush-woeful-manchester-city-to-keep-title-bid-alive/articleshow/117872856.cms,"NEW DELHI: With a 5-1 thumping of a miserable Manchester City on Sunday, Arsenal maintained their hopes of winning the Premier League title, while the struggling champions suffered yet another setback in their terrible season.Following Liverpool's 2-0 victory over Bournemouth on Saturday, which put them nine points ahead of the Gunners, Mikel Arteta 's team had no room for mistake in the title fight.After 103 seconds at the Emirates Stadium, Martin Odegaard's first goal emboldened them to go on a spectacular display.Shortly after halftime, Erling Haaland scored his 25th goal of the season across all competitions to tie the score for City.However, when Thomas Partey took advantage of Phil Foden's shoddy pass to put Arsenal back ahead, the thoughtless errors that have plagued City over a lackluster season proved to be the difference.Kai Havertz and Ethan Nwaneri's late goals and Myles Lewis-Skelly's debut goal for Arsenal completed a brilliant performance that saw the Gunners get within six points of Liverpool.Although Arsenal's strong performance increased their undefeated streak to 14 games and demonstrated their desire to fight the Reds to the end, Liverpool's game in hand maintains them comfortably in charge of the title race.City's six-game winning streak in the top tier came to a cruel end, and they have now lost all four of their league encounters with Arsenal.After their miserable season, City's hopes of winning a fifth straight crown were long since dashed, and now Pep Guardiola's fourth-place team is concentrating on making it to the Champions League However, unless Guardiola can address the glaring gaps in his defense and the lack of energy in his midfield, even that might be beyond them, let alone defeating Real Madrid in this season's playoff round.Abdukodir Khusanov, a former Lens defender who made a clumsy start against Chelsea last weekend, was replaced by John Stones by Guardiola.Stones, however, was a part of the disastrous defense that gave Arsenal the lead in the second minute.Stones put his fellow defender in a tight spot with a pass to the marked Manuel Akanji.Leandro Trossard robbed Akanji right away, and with City's defense in disarray, Kai Havertz picked out Odegaard, who then slotted home from ten yards out.Guardiola marched thunderously back to the bench, already fearing the worst.The frustrated Guardiola made a variety of furious gestures as a result of City controlling possession but being toothless for extended periods of time.During the tempestuous 2-2 draw earlier this season, Haaland infuriated Arsenal by instructing Arteta to ""stay humble"" and hurling the ball at Gunners defender Gabriel Magalhaes.Unsurprisingly, Haaland scored City's equalizer in the 55th minute.Haaland had the opportunity to sneak in front of William Saliba and bury his close-range header after Savinho's excellently weighted cross.However, it only took Arsenal two minutes to make Haaland stop smiling.After Partey intercepted Foden's pass, the Ghanaian midfielder launched a strong long-range shot that struck Stones with a deft deflection.In the 62nd minute, Lewis-Skelly went for the kill as Arsenal smelt blood.The 18-year-old left-back cut inside the City area and curled a beautiful finish into the far corner with elegance that belied his inexperience.Lewis-Skelly mimicked the City star's contemplative celebration by sitting down with his legs crossed to mark the goal in a playful jab at Haaland.The much-maligned Havertz scored in the 76th minute, adding to the suffering of shell-shocked City.After stomping through City's flimsy defense, Gabriel Martinelli set up Havertz for a clinical 10-yard finish.Nwaneri, a young forward, struck the final punch deep into stoppage time with a brilliant goal into the far corner from a sharp angle.For the second time in a humiliating day, City had no answer to the taunts of ""you're getting sacked in the morning"" from Arsenal supporters directed at Guardiola.","Arsenal maintained their hopes of winning the Premier League title with a 5-1 thumping of a miserable Manchester City.

NEW DELHI: Liverpool on Saturday secured a 2-0 victory at Bournemouth with Mohamed Salah 's disputed penalty, extending their lead to nine points in the Premier League The opening goal came through Salah's penalty after Cody Gakpo appeared to fall over his own feet rather than from Lewis Cook's challenge.The decision sparked outrage from Bournemouth after referee Darren England's initial call was supported by VAR.""The referee's call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR – with the challenge deemed to have been a trip by Cook on Gakpo. The VAR also confirmed Gakpo was onside in the build-up,"" the Premier League said in a statement.Salah later scored his second goal in the match, further extending Liverpool's advantage over Arsenal in second place.The Egyptian forward has now scored 21 goals in 23 league appearances this season, achieving the 20-goal milestone for the fifth time in his Premier League career.With 178 Premier League goals, Salah has moved ahead of Frank Lampard into sixth place on the all-time scoring list.Liverpool have not lost in 19 league matches, winning 17 of their 23 games since Arne Slot took over from Jurgen Klopp before the season began.Liverpool, pursuing their 20th title and first since 2020, await the outcome of Manchester City's match against Arsenal on Sunday.They face Tottenham in the League Cup semi-final second leg on Thursday, trying to overcome a 1-0 deficit.The only concern for Slot was an injury to England right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold in the second half.Bournemouth's impressive season included home victories over Manchester City and Arsenal, plus a 5-0 win against Nottingham Forest last week.Their 11-game unbeaten league run ended against a determined Liverpool side.The match began dramatically when Alexander-Arnold lost possession to Antoine Semenyo after 12 seconds, requiring a save from Alisson Becker.Alexander-Arnold's defensive struggles continued as his poor clearance allowed Justin Kluivert through on goal before Alisson made another save.Semenyo managed to evade two defenders and hit the woodwork with a powerful shot.Liverpool showed their attacking prowess with Kepa Arrizabalaga saving Dominik Szoboszlai's attempt.The controversial opening goal came in the 30th minute when Cook appeared to make no contact with Gakpo before the penalty was given.Salah converted the penalty with confidence despite the controversy.Bournemouth's immediate response through David Brooks was ruled offside by VAR.Alisson continued his impressive performance by denying Semenyo in a one-on-one situation.The match saw more VAR involvement with checks for Alexander-Arnold's handball and Alexis Mac Allister's potential second yellow card for fouling Brooks.Marcus Tavernier hit the post with a long-range effort before Kluivert missed the rebound opportunity.Salah sealed the victory in the 75th minute, receiving Curtis Jones' pass and finishing skillfully past Kepa.",Liverpool beat Bournemouth 2-0 in Premier League.

Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane has criticised Marcus Rashford , stating that the forward ""must be ashamed"" of his current situation under manager Ruben Amorim .The 27-year-old has not played for United in seven weeks, and Amorim has made it clear that Rashford ""has to change"" if he wants to have a future at Old Trafford. Despite training with the squad ahead of Thursday's Europa League match against Romanian side FCSB, Rashford was left out of the traveling squad.With the transfer window closing at 23:00 GMT on Monday, Rashford has been linked with a potential loan move to Barcelona, but time is running out to finalize a deal.Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane expressed his frustration over Rashford’s situation:""I can't get involved in the conversation, I still can't understand at any level. Whatever's going on with players leaving, months left on contracts, a player who doesn't train properly... I don't understand it.You might as well leave me out of this conversation. Especially if you think he wants to move, which is more of a reason to train properly so when you go to a new club you're up to speed and when you leave the club at least you showed a decent attitude. He must be ashamed.""Fellow United legend Wayne Rooney also shared his thoughts, recalling a recent visit to United’s Carrington training facility :""I went into Carrington on Sunday to take my kids to game day, and Marcus Rashford was out on the training pitch with the fitness coach, but he was right over towards where the parents were walking past for the kids' games.I looked at him thinking how embarrassing it must be for him as parents walk past.""Rooney admitted he had spoken to Rashford and advised him to leave Manchester United in order to revive his career:""I've spoken to Marcus a couple of times and I've given him my thoughts and feelings that he needs to leave the football club because whatever is going on in his life and at Manchester United, he's not the same. For him to have a fresh start, he needs to leave the club.""A product of United’s youth academy, Rashford has scored 138 goals in 426 appearances for the club, including seven goals in 24 games this season. However, a potential move remains complicated due to his reported £300,000-a-week ($374,000) contract, which runs until 2028.",Marcus Rashford has not played for Manchester United in seven weeks.

Anand Amritraj slams Indian stars for skipping Davis Cup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/anand-amritraj-slams-indian-stars-for-skipping-davis-cup/articleshow/117900335.cms,"MUMBAI: Former India Davis Cup captain Anand Amritaj has ripped into the country's top-ranked players who have recently turned down the chance to represent the nation in the prestigious team competition.India's expected demolition of minnows Togo in New Delhi on Sunday came without top singles player Sumit Nagal and Yuki Bhambri , the second ranked doubles player in the country.Nagal's case particularly garnered attention after the All India Tennis Association (Aita) had recently claimed that the 27-year-old had demanded an annual fee of $50,000 to play Davis Cup ties for India. The player defended his stand in a lengthy post on social media, saying ""it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country"".Amritraj , who worked with Nagal when he held the role of captain a few years ago, described the idea as ""inconceivable"".""To me personally, it is just inconceivable that if you are ranked high enough and the country wants you to play, that you would play without any financial compensation,"" Amritraj told reporters here on the sidelines of the L&T Mumbai Open at the Cricket Club of India on Monday.""Unless you are injured and you can't walk on the court, other than that, there should be no question that you're going to play Davis Cup. Same for me, same for Vijay,"" he added, referring to his brother with whom he helped India reach the 1974 Davis Cup finals against South Africa.""Both of us felt that it is the greatest honour that you can have to play for your country. Maybe this is old-school thinking, but that is absolutely how it should be.""You got 50 weeks in the year to make money, two weeks of the year, you should be able to give to places you grew up in, and it should be an honour and a privilege.""On Nagal's case, the 73-yearold said: ""I like Sumit, when I was captain he was the reserve on my team five years ago. I got along very well with him, but he didn't play the last tie (vs Sweden in Sept) either, which is really a shame because he is our best player right now.""Asked if there should be strong repercussions for players who choose to not turn up for national team duties, Amritraj said it was a tricky situation as players could always lean on the ""independence of the ATP Tour "" to make their decisions.With some Indian players, however, enjoying government funding through programmes like the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), it could be a way for Aita to crack the whip, Amritraj felt.""That's where you should put the screws on them. I think you should definitely do that. If you're in any kind of place with some leverage, you should say: 'Either you play Davis Cup, or you won't get this'. Simple.""","Top-ranked players Sumit Nagal and Yuki Bhambri turned down chance to represent India.

"Handed wildcards, Indians have a point to prove",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/handed-wildcards-indians-have-a-point-to-prove/articleshow/117891061.cms,"Ramkumar Ramanathan

CHENNAI: Indian tennis is not going through the best of times. While its top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has made good strides in recent years, the rest of the crop has struggled in the journey to the top.The player distribution in the Chennai Open Challenger best explains the current scenario. Even in a home tournament, India, in the absence of Nagal, is forced to rely on wildcards for main-draw singles entries as the next-best players from the country find it difficult to directly make the cut. Davis Cuppers Mukund Sasikumar (ranked 365), Ramkumar Ramanathan (406) and Karan Singh will have a point to prove after being awarded wildcards by the organisers.The onus will be on the experienced Ramkumar and Mukund to gain valuable points to move up in the rankings chart. The 28-year-old Mukund had a good run in Chennai last year, reaching the quarterfinals, but could not carry forward the momentum in the tournaments that followed. Ramkumar’s story in the past few years has not been much different, with the 30-year-old’s inconsistency hampering his chances to move to a higher level. Youngster Karan has shown promise in the early stages of his career and is steadily rising up the ladder.Moving to foreign interest, quite a few players are looking to resurrect their careers and compete in the Grand Slams. For instance, Lloyd Harris, who is the second seed in singles, was once ranked as high as 31 and reached the quarterfinals of the US Open in 2021. Injury issues forced the South African to stay away from action for quite a long period and the 27-year-old will compete in his first match since the Wimbledon last year.Former world No. 35 Jiri Vesely had to sit out in 2023 due to injury concerns. The 31-year-old had won the ATP 250 title in Pune in 2020 and had a good time in India in the past. Ahead of the Chennai Open, Vesely said: “Preparations have been good and I am getting used to the weather, but it is not easy. It is always nice to be in India and people are very friendly and supportive. I love coming back here and I hope to have a good run on this trip.”Vesely dropped outside the top-600 a few years ago and since then, he has found it tough to be back to his best. “I wish to move up and it is not easy. A lot of youngsters are playing well and I need to compete with them and give my best.”","India's top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has made good strides in recent years.

Jacopo Berrettini looks up to brother Matteo to climb the ladder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jacopo-berrettini-looks-up-to-brother-matteo-to-climb-the-ladder/articleshow/117890986.cms,"Jacopo Berrettini

CHENNAI: Italian tennis player Jacopo Berrettini does not have to look far for inspiration. The 26-year-old shares a strong bond with his elder brother Matteo Berrettini , a former top-10 singles player and 2021 Wimbledon finalist, whom he regards not only his best friend but also his idol.“I have a good relationship with him. He is a very good human, and I am so glad and lucky to have him. Apart from on-court training, he mentors me off the field and is a good coach. We shared the same (coaching) team for the past three years and now share the same trainer. Before coming here, we trained together for three days in Rome,” Jacopo, who will begin his season at the Chennai Open Challenger , told TOI on Saturday.Jacopo and Matteo had a tough 2023 as their seasons were marred by injuries. Matteo had to take a six-month break, while Jacopo had to miss the majority of the year. In that period, the Berrettini brothers helped each other stay mentally strong. “It was a very tough period for us, for our family. We were trying to be the humans that we are, trying to stay mentally focused and healthy. We had to work a lot after recovery because this sport is so tough mentally and physically. We were trying to enjoy life outside the sport as it is very important as well. After suffering from a lot of injuries, Matteo had a good season last year,” Jacopo added.While Jacopo and Matteo do not spend much time together due to their playing commitments, they are always in touch. “We try to talk often and as much as we can. Sometimes, we train together, but if we are not able to spend a lot of time, it is okay since we travel and play regularly. We are healthy and that is a good thing for us.”‘Aim to carry forward momentum’: Jacopo had a productive season last year and achieved his career-best singles ranking of 317. The Italian will look to carry forward the momentum, starting with his season opener in Chennai. “It was a good year (2024) for me, playing many matches without any injury concerns. I worked on many aspects and will try to keep going. My goal for this year is to compete in the qualifiers of the Grand Slams, for which I have to get close to the 230 mark (rankings).”",Italian tennis player Jacopo Berrettini shares a strong bond with his elder brother Matteo.

Davis Cup: India return to Group 1 with 4-0 win over Togo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/davis-cup-india-return-to-group-1-with-4-0-win-over-togo/articleshow/117873861.cms,"NEW DELHI: India returned to the Davis Cup World Group 1 with a comprehensive 4-0 win over Togo in the Playoff here at the DLTA complex on Sunday. The hosts, who had taken a commanding 2-0 lead by winning the first two singles on the opening day of the tie on Saturday, completed the formality with two dominant wins - in doubles and singles - on Sunday. The fifth rubber was not played. The World Group 1 tie would be played in September later this year and the name of their opponents would be announced later.The doubles pair of Sriram Balaji and Davis Cup debutant Rithvik Bollipalli put the hosts ahead in the fourth game when they broke M'lapa Akomlo, the substitute for regular player Thomas Setodji who pulled out with an injury. Akomlo proved to be the weak link as the Indians, playing some smart tennis with clever ball placement and strong net presence, broke his service to take the set 6-2. The second set was even shorter as the Indians broke Akomlo and his partner Isak Padio once each to claim the set 6-1. The match lasted 57 minutes.With the tie secured, India gave rookie Karan Singh his Davis Cup debut in the dead rubber and the 21-year-old did not disappoint as he beat Isak, whom Togo fielded in place of original choice Setodji. The 20-year-old in fact put up the best show by a Togolese player on the trip as he stretched most of the games. He even managed to break Singh once in the second set as India won the match 6-2, 6-3 - the first instance when Togo won three games in a set on this tour.""I started playing tennis when I was an 11-year-old and I had no idea how far I would go. I just kept going day by day. And here we are today. And I really enjoyed playing the match today. All the teammates were really cheering me,"" Karan later said.The other Davis Cup debutant Bollipalli shared his thoughts: ""Playing in Davis Cup is a different feeling. It's a little bit different from the regular matches that we play.""'Grooming future captain'Interestingly, once India won the doubles match and the Playoff, regular captain Rohit Rajpal took a backseat and allowed Mukund Sasikumar occupy the captain's chair during the fourth rubber, played by Karan Singh. The captain's chairs are placed next to the chair umpire so that the players could consult with the captains during game breaks. ""I always do that. Sometimes it's as important as grooming players. Sitting on that chair has a different kind of pressure you need that experience. It's good for them. They'll be the future captains. We'll come and go as seniors, but these guys are here to stay,"" Rajpal said.","India return to the Davis Cup World Group 1 with a comprehensive 4-0 win over Togo in the Playoff.

Elise Mertens secured her first WTA title in 17 months on Sunday, defeating unseeded Ann Li in straight sets to claim the Singapore Tennis Open.The second-seeded Belgian, who had fallen to McCartney Kessler in the Hobart International final last month, showcased her dominance at the Kallang Tennis Centre , winning 75 percent of her first-serve points to overpower the American 6-1, 6-4.Li had not dropped a set en route to the final but struggled with her serve early on, allowing Mertens to capitalize with three service breaks to wrap up the opening set in just 26 minutes.The American was broken again at the start of the second set but responded by breaking Mertens for the first time in the following game, settling into a better rhythm on serve.However, serving to stay in the match at 4-5, Li committed a pair of unforced errors, handing Mertens the victory after one hour and 22 minutes. The win marked Mertens' ninth career WTA singles title and her first since triumphing at the Monastir Open in Tunisia in October 2023.In the doubles final, second seeds Desirae Krawczyk of the United States and Giuliana Olmos of Mexico clinched the title with a commanding 7-5, 6-0 victory over the third-seeded Chinese duo of Wang Xinyu and Zheng Saisai.","Elise Mertens defeated Ann Li 6-1, 6-4 to win the Singapore Tennis Open.

NEW DELHI: N Sriram Balaji and Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli secured India's place in the Davis Cup World Group I with a commanding straight-set victory , handing the hosts an unassailable 3-0 lead against Togo in the play-off tie on Sunday.With a 2-0 advantage, India needed to win just one of the three matches, and the duo of Balaji and Bollipalli accomplished the task in the opening contest against M'lapa Tingou Akomolo and Hod'abalo Isak Padio, winning 6-2, 6-1 in just 57 minutes at the DLTA Complex .Togo replaced their top player, Thomas Setodji, with M'lapa Tingou Akomolo due to an arm injury, which proved detrimental as Akomolo struggled to hold serve throughout the match. Balaji's serving was exceptional, losing only one point on his serve during the entire contest.The Indians gained their first break when Akomolo served in the third game, and from there, it was a one-sided affair. Bollipalli, making his debut, overcame initial nerves and settled into the match, contributing significantly to the victory.The pair's experience of winning a Challenger together last year proved advantageous, as they displayed a straightforward and efficient performance. India is likely to give young Karan Singh a debut in the dead rubber match.Balaji and Bollipalli's convincing straight-set victory sealed India's place in the Davis Cup World Group I, showcasing their dominance and leaving Togo with little chance for a comeback.","N Sriram Balaji and Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli secured India's place in the Davis Cup World Group I with a commanding straight-set victory.

They were tamed in front of 1500-odd fans by India's Mukund Sasikumar and Ramkumar Ramanathan in less than two hours of p lay, in just 29 games, on the DLTA hard court.The contest looked on for the first three games of the first match when Mukund was tested by Liova Ajavon, who even came close to breaking the Indian in the third game.

Togo captain Alisama Agnamba later disclosed that Setodji, who played with adhesive tapes on his right hand, competed with an injury. The captain, however, did not reveal the nature of injury and whether the player would be available for his Sunday's doubles and reverse singles matches.""We played unforced, error-free tennis for the most part,"" Mukund later said. ""I'm happy with myself with the way I handled the whole situation. I think I put up a very mature performance. There was a lot of composure. I stuck to the plan, kept things very simple and did the job that I was supposed to do.""Ramkumar was happy with his service game. ""It was a good serving day. I didn't expect it to be,"" he quipped. Togo's Setodji agreed with his Indian counterpart. ""They were serving better than us. And on this kind of courts, you have to serve well.

IND vs AUS: Rishabh Pant on dropped Rohit Sharma, criticism, Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: Is Rohit Sharma dropped or rested? India captain Rohit on Saturday addressed the speculation regarding his absence from the fifth and final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground.Rohit, who has played three Tests against Australia in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy , has struggled with the bat, averaging just 6.2, with a highest score of 10.During the lunch break on Day 2, Rohit spoke to broadcasters and clarified the reason behind missing the SCG Test .: There were reports suggesting you were rested, dropped, or opted out.: None of that is true. I stood down. I informed the selectors and coach that I wasn't scoring runs, so I decided to step away.""I stood down that is what I would say. Basically the chat I had with the coach and selector was simple: I am not in form, it is an important match and we need a player in form. Not thinking too far ahead, right now what the team needs is the priority,"" Rohit said.""I made this decision after we came here (Sydney), it was going on in my mind that it is important for me to step aside because I wasn't getting runs with the bat.""When I arrived in Perth it was quite evident why we won that game, we had that 200-run (opening) partnership in the second innings which is what won us the game. KL Rahul and Jaiswal played really well, and they brought us into situation where we couldn't lose the game,"" Rohit said.Rohit had stepped away from T20 international cricket last year after leading India to the World Cup, though he has not yet announced his retirement from ODIs.He missed the first Test in Perth for the birth of his second child, and since then, his form has dipped, failing to exceed 10 runs in any of his five innings.This slump in form mirrors his disappointing performance during India's 3-0 home series loss to New Zealand in October-November.","India captain Rohit Sharma has not played in the fifth and final Test against Australia.

IND vs AUS: Rishabh Pant on dropped Rohit Sharma, criticism, Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: During the lunch break on the second day of the fifth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , Indian captain Rohit Sharma addressed his absence from the playing XI while lauding the leadership qualities of stand-in skipper Jasprit Bumrah Rohit revealed that his decision to sit out the Sydney Test stemmed from his inability to contribute effectively with the bat. ""I stood down, that is what I would say. Basically the chat I had with the coach and selector was simple: I am not in form, it is an important match and we need a player in form,"" he explained in an interview with Star Sports.Shifting focus to Bumrah, Rohit expressed his admiration for the pacer’s remarkable journey over the past decade. ""The way he [Bumrah] sets standards with the ball, he is absolute class. When I saw him for the first time in 2013, his graph has gone really high ever since and has gone from strength to strength,"" Rohit said.However, Rohit also acknowledged the challenges that come with leadership. ""Nothing is given in this format of the game; you’ve got to earn it. What happens in leadership is, every day will not be a good day. Ideas and mindset can be the same, but sometimes the result won’t work in your favor,"" he added, offering advice from his own experience as captain.The first session of the day saw India’s bowlers deliver a dominant performance, reducing Australia to 101/5 in response to India’s modest first-innings total of 185. Bumrah (2/27) and Mohammed Siraj (2/28) led the charge with two wickets apiece, while Prasidh Krishna , stepping in for the injured Akash Deep, claimed the crucial wicket of Steve Smith just before the break.Reflecting on the match situation, Rohit noted the importance of patience on a challenging pitch. ""The discussion before the start today was that there’s a lot [of assistance for the bowlers] on the wicket, and it will be a game of patience. Our batters struggled, and we knew it wouldn’t be easy for their batters either. The challenge is to maintain pressure consistently, and we’ve taken five wickets in the session. The boys bowled really well, and the catching was excellent as well,"" he said.Looking ahead, Rohit stressed the significance of building on their strong start. ""The next session is going to be really crucial. This is what happens in Test cricket—every session is crucial. We won the previous session; hopefully, we will win the next session as well,"" he concluded.",Rohit Sharma says he stood down because he was not in form. India captain hails Jasprit Bumrah's leadership qualities. India bowlers take five wickets in the first session of the second day.

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma can be best described as a leader, both on and off the field. Although he was dropped from the fifth and final Test against Australia, he was seen engaging with his teammates, including Jasprit Bumrah , during the drinks break on Day 2 at the Sydney Cricket Ground .""The discussion was that there is lot on the wicket and it will be a game of patience,"" Rohit said while speaking to broadcasters.""Our batters struggled and we knew it won't be easy for their batters as well, the challenge is to maintain pressure consistently and we have five wickets in the session.

NEW DELHI: If the opening day of the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground was dramatic, Day 2 brought even more high-octane action. After bowling out India for a modest 185 on a grassy SCG pitch, Australia found themselves in trouble at the start of their first innings. Jasprit Bumrah , who dismissed Usman Khawaja late on Day 1, struck again early on Day 2 by removing Marnus Labuschagne. Mohammed Siraj then took center stage, producing a game-changing over that left Australia reeling.Siraj’s first breakthrough came with a superb outswinger to Sam Konstas, who drove with hard hands and edged it to Yashasvi Jaiswal at gully, where a stunning catch was taken.Siraj followed it up with another outswinger, this time slightly shorter, which induced a thick edge from Travis Head. The ball flew to KL Rahul at second slip, who made no mistake.Siraj was visibly pumped after his two-wicket burst, with Virat Kohli joining the celebrations in trademark fashion—jumping and pumping his fists with enthusiasm.Kohli then turned to the crowd, waving his arms to fire them up, adding to the electrifying atmosphere at the SCG.Australia, leading 2-1, need a win or a draw to reclaim the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after a decade.

Another controversy erupted early on the first morning of the fifth Test between India and Australia in Sydney when a relay catch involving Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne off Virat Kohli 's bat was ruled by the third umpire as not legitimate.With Indian openers KL Rahul (4) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (10) dismissed early, India were 17 for 2 when Kohli came in to bat and edged the first ball he faced from Scott Boland to the slips, where the Aussie players claimed the relay catch between Smith and Labuschagne.Diving low to his right, Smith believed to have got his fingers underneath the ball before lobbing it in the air for Labuschagne to complete the catch. The decision was referred by the on-field umpires for review, and the third umpire ruled that the ball grazed the ground before Smith lobbed it back up.Talking to Fox Cricket at the lunch break, Smith said he has no doubt that it was a clean catch, but they have to accept the decision taken by the match officials.""Did you get your hand underneath that ball?"" former England player turned commentator Isa Guha asked Smith?""100%, no denying it whatsoever. But the umpires made the decision, and we move on,"" replied Smith.After replays were shown on the giant screen and the third umpire announced his view, Kohli was seen shaking his head with a wry smile on his face.India went to lunch at a shaky 57 for 3, losing Shubman Gill (20) off the last ball delivered by off-spinner Nathan Lyon before the break, leaving Kohli on the crease at 20 not out. He was joined by Rishabh Pant post lunch.Earlier, India left captain Rohit Sharma out of the eleven, with Jasprit Bumrah doing the leadership duty and chose to bat first after winning the toss.India made two changes to their team. Shubman Gill took Rohit's place, while Prasidh Krishna came in for fellow pacer Akash Deep who is out with a back injury.","Third umpire rules Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne's relay catch off Virat Kohli not legitimate.

NEW DELHI: India lost openers KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal early after captain Jasprit Bumrah won the toss and opted to bat against Australia in overcast conditions and a grassy pitch at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday. Mitchell Starc dismissed KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal fell to Scott Boland. Virat Kohli arrived at the crease with India at 17/2 in 7.4 overs with the Aussies charged up.With Kohli getting dismissed caught behind the stumps throughout the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy , the Aussies had set the trap with a full slip cordon in place.Boland bowled back of a length delivery that nipped away, took the edge as Kohli pushed at it.The ball went down and Steve Smith at second slip thought he scooped it up but the ball had just grazed the turf before being taken by Marnus Labuschagne at gully.Aussies were delirious when they claimed it. But the third umpire took his time and signalled it not out and Kohli survived falling for a first ball duck.But former Australian opener and coach Justin Langer maintained that Kohli was out.7Cricket shared a post on X with Langer saying, ""From what I have seen there, that makes it more obvious to me that should have been out. Steve Smith had his fingers (underneath the ball), and you could see he was flicking the ball up, it was brilliant what he did. He had his fingers under the ball, he flicked it up deliberately and in my opinion that's out.""Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting also shared his views on the decision, ""As far as I was concerned, if (the ball) had've come out of (Smith's) hand, he wouldn't have been able to scoop it up. That's what I'm saying, I think his fingers are clearly underneath the ball ... look where his pointer figure is there, it's still underneath the ball.""Kohli, from 10 Tests and 19 innings in 2024, scored 417 runs at an average of 24.52 with one hundred and one fifty.That century by Virat was the unbeaten 100 he scored in the first Test in Perth - the match that India won by 295 runs.",India lost openers KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal early after captain Jasprit Bumrah won the toss and opted to bat against Australia.

Sydney: ""We're going to have a look at the wicket and finalise it tomorrow."" ""As I just said, we're going to have a look at the wicket and announce playing 11 tomorrow.""India head coach Gautam Gambhir responded when he was quizzed about the playing XI on eve of the fifth and final Test in Sydney.It was a typical response but what spiced up proceedings was the fact that he was categorically asked about Rohit Sharma 's participation at Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). Not once, but twice.The response remained the same, even the words to a degree, and certainly raised quite a few eyebrows in the media room. It was Gambhir's first interaction with the media in Australia as the coach mysteriously stayed away after the pre-departure address back in November.He was back in the hot seat at a time when a lot of questions were being raised about the environment in the dressing room, knee-jerk reactions while selecting the XI and the defeat in Melbourne which came after a debatable call to benchThe No. 3 was benched to accommodate Rohit back at top of the order but it didn't work out as the Indian captain's lean patch continued and India were outplayed in the Boxing Day Test.Gambhir was constantly asked about the transition, discussions with senior players and he maintained that ""Indian cricket is in safe hands"" while emphasising the importance of ""honesty"".There was a lot of straight talk during the interaction which lasted a little over ten minutes but it was the sequence of events which followed that added to intrigue of India's last practice session of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .Moments after finishing the presser, Gambhir engaged in a long conversation with Jasprit Bumrah near the change room as the rest of the lot played foot-volley. Once the warm-up was complete, the head coach made his way to the ground and had a chat with Shubman Gill, who was doing fielding drills at that time with coach T Dilip and Washington Sundar. A short chat was followed by a fist pump, pat on the back and soon Bumrah joined and gave Gill a handshake.The youngster, who was dropped for the Boxing Day Test, continued with more close-in catching drills as the likes of Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, KL Rahul, Nitish K Reddy and Yashasvi Jaiswal did some slip-catching. All this while Rohit stood away from the group and didn't participate in the catching drills, which he was very active in before the Melbourne fixture, and was one of the last players to leave the ground as rest of the batters made their way to the nets.Kohli, KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Ravindra Jadeja got the session underway and Rohit, still in his training shorts and sweatshirt, had a long chat with Washington Sundar outside the dressing room.Sundar left and then it was Gill's turn to speak to the skipper and this time they had Bumrah for company too. When the mini-conference was over, all players were sweating it out but Rohit was nowhere to be seen.Kohli, Jaiswal, KL, Jadeja and now Gill too were swapping nets as they continued to face the likes of Sundar, Reddy, Prasidh Krishna, Harshit Rana and a lot of side-arm.The action continued before Rohit finally made an appearance and stood in a corner chatting with video analyst Hari before starting a long, light-hearted chat with Bumrah. The seamer had a ball in his hand and the two cracked plenty of jokes but Rohit didn't look in the mood to have a hit.Players started to leave the area and Rohit exited too, adding to the curiosity of the travelling media contingent. He, however, returned in a few minutes with the batting gear on and had a small hit before India wrapped up their final session of the tour.It wasn't a usual net session as Rohit remains very chatty in the middle and has never stood in a corner, away from all the action. Thursday, however, was different and felt different. Even as the public announcer practiced the names of skippers of the two teams in the main ground, Rohit gave enough hints that he wasn't going to be one for the New Year Test. He has been for quite some time now and it wasn't a surprise that he has been dropped for the final game of the series.All signs in the nets pointed in only one direction and that was Rohit making way for Gill. The coach maintained that the call will be taken on the morning of the match but Rohit's last Test in whites has certainly happened at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and like most stalwarts, he signed off without a farewell match.","India head coach Gautam Gambhir was quizzed about the playing XI on eve of the fifth and final Test in Sydney.

NEW DELHI: Australian opener Sam Konstas , who had a heated argument with India captain Jasprit Bumrah , has come under fire for his strategy in the last over of the first day of the SCG Test .Before Usman Khawaja , Australia 's other opener, was caught on the last ball of the day, Konstas engaged in a furious back and forth with Bumrah and his Indian teammates.With Konstas in the line of fire following his aggressive stance towards the opposition, the wicket caused India to celebrate in large numbers.Australia had a tense three overs to negotiate before stumps after India was bowled out for 185 on the first day, but Khawaja's wicket guaranteed that India would have the final laugh.According to a report in Fox Sports, there were suggestions that while Khawaja attempted to soothe his younger teammate, Konstas' flamboyant demeanor diverted him from finishing the day's play.Konstas has been accused of going too far in Sydney after being praised for his courageous approach to his Test debut innings of 60, which included Virat Kohli shoulder bumping him.As India attempt to gain an advantage over the young star and his Australian teammates, Konstas is stepping over the line between bravery and confidence.Several luminaries and commentators, including Adam Gilchrist , offered their thoughts on Konstas' strategy late on the first day.""They're charging in from everywhere … All sorts of drama here,"" Gilchrist said.""It was Bumrah who turned to Konstas. He learns a tough lesson in his second Test match.""The celebration was somewhat unique. Normally it's hands in the air but they all turned and fixed their eyes on one man.""Greats and commentators expressed their disapproval of Konstas' behavior in a chorus on X.","Sam Konstas has come under fire for his strategy in the last over of the first day of the SCG Test.

NEW DELHI: On the second day of the second and final Test between Zimbabwe and Afghanistan in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's captain Craig Ervine top-scored with 75 runs, leading his team to a first-innings total of 243.Ervine's innings was supported by valuable contributions from experienced batters Sikandar Raza (61) and Sean Williams (49), as Zimbabwe recovered from a precarious position of 41/4.Ervine's partnerships of 71 runs for the fifth wicket with Raza and 73 runs for the eighth wicket with Williams were instrumental in Zimbabwe's fightback.The 39-year-old skipper struck two sixes and four fours, while Raza hit six fours and Williams eight fours before being dismissed one run short of a half-century, despite being given not out initially.Afghanistan's leg-spinner Rashid Khan was the most successful bowler, claiming four wickets for 94 runs, including the dismissals of Williams and Ervine.In their second innings, Afghanistan faced early setbacks as Zimbabwe's opening bowler Blessing Muzarabani dismissed openers Abdul Malik (1) and Hassan (11) with the score at 18.The visitors suffered a further blow when captain Hashmatullah Shahidi (13) was bowled by an unplayable delivery from Sikandar Raza.At the close of play, Afghanistan were 46-3, trailing Zimbabwe by 40 runs, with bad light halting proceedings.In a separate development, it was announced that Ireland would undertake an all-formats tour of Zimbabwe from February 6-25, featuring a Test match in Bulawayo followed by six white-ball matches in Harare.","Zimbabwe captain Craig Ervine top-scored with 75 runs.

Centuries from Ryan Rickelton and Temba Bavuma propelled South Africa to a commanding position on day one of the second Test against Pakistan at Newlands. South Africa ended the day at 316 for four.Rickelton, unbeaten on 176, and Bavuma, who scored 106, forged a crucial 235-run partnership for the fourth wicket. Their partnership began when South Africa was precariously placed at 72 for three.At that point, South Africa risked squandering the advantage of winning the toss on a batsman-friendly pitch. However, Rickelton and Bavuma batted with assurance, rarely facing difficulty.They reached their fifty partnership in 66 balls, maintaining a consistent scoring rate exceeding four runs per over throughout their time at the crease.This century marked Rickelton's second in just three Test matches, a remarkable turnaround after a challenging start to his Test career. In his initial twelve Test innings, he had not managed a single half-century.Rickelton's innings showcased his dominance, hitting 21 fours and a six in his 232-ball stay.Bavuma's century was the fourth of his Test career, adding to his impressive tally of 24 Test half-centuries. He was dismissed shortly before the close of play, caught behind off Salman Agha's part-time off-spin.Bavuma's 179-ball innings included nine fours and two sixes.Pakistan's performance was lackluster, despite claiming three wickets before lunch. They only managed to bowl 80 overs in six and a half hours and struggled to create consistent pressure.Pakistan's opening batsman, Saim Ayub, sustained an ankle injury early in the day. He fell awkwardly in the outfield during the seventh over and was taken off the field on a stretcher, unable to return.Pakistan's hopes were briefly raised when Aiden Markram was caught behind off Khurram Shahzad for 17. Markram and Rickelton had put on 61 runs for the first wicket.Shortly before lunch, Wiaan Mulder and Tristan Stubbs were dismissed in quick succession, caught behind off Mohammad Abbas and Salman Agha respectively, for scores of 5 and 0.The remainder of the day belonged to South Africa, with Rickelton and Bavuma firmly in control.","Ryan Rickelton and Temba Bavuma scored centuries on day one of the second Test against Pakistan at Newlands.

Subsequently, this became the highest score by an Indian captain in the series, outstripping Rohit Sharma , who has struggled for runs.The 31-year-old took the captaincy mantle in dramatic fashion after Rohit was dropped following a poor run of form, with just 31 runs in the series.Rohit’s initial absence due to the birth of his second child and subsequent inability to recover form left India searching for leadership. Bumrah, having led the team to their first victory in BGT this time, took charge and immediately made his presence felt.On a challenging pitch, where India's top-order collapsed, Bumrah’s enterprising 22 off 17 balls injected much-needed energy.His innings, studded with three fours and a majestic six, lifted India's total to a modest yet potentially competitive 185.Despite wickets falling around him, Bumrah showed grit and determination, exemplifying the fighting spirit India needed to stay alive in this high-stakes encounter.As the day drew to a close, Bumrah’s influence extended beyond the bat.Taking the new ball, the skipper delivered a good-length delivery to dismiss Australia’s prolific opener, Usman Khawaja, on the final ball of the day.This wicket pegged Australia back to 9 for 1, setting the tone for a tight contest as the match heads into Day 2.With 860 deliveries and 31 wickets in just five Tests of the series, Bumrah has been called into action, either with bat or ball, on every single day of this series.",Jasprit Bumrah scored 22 runs on Day 1 of the fifth Test against Australia.

Barcelona 's head coach Hansi Flick expressed his discontent on Friday regarding the potential departure of crucial midfielder Dani Olmo due to the club's financial difficulties, while remaining hopeful for a positive resolution.On Tuesday, the Catalan club announced their request to the Spanish football federation for a new playing licence for Spanish international Olmo, following the expiration of his initial registration on December 31, 2024, after Barcelona had exhausted all legal options for extension.Barcelona acquired Olmo for approximately 60 million euros ($62 million) last summer. Spanish media reports suggest his contract contains a provision allowing his release if registration requirements are not met.Due to La Liga 's strict financial regulations limiting Barcelona's expenditure, the debt-laden club initially managed to register Olmo only after Andreas Christensen's injury in August.Striker Pau Victor faces a similar registration predicament.""If I am honest, I was not happy about the situation, and the players are not happy about the situation,"" Flick told a news conference Friday.""But it is like it is and we have to accept it, we are professional, we have to play football. I have to coach and the club has to do their job.""The confidence (in the club) is there, I am always positive about things, but we have to wait for the decision.""Barcelona are set to face Barbastro in the Copa del Rey round of 32 on Saturday, currently without Olmo and Victor.""My job is to prepare the team for the cup,"" continued Flick.""I was in contact before Christmas with the president and I spoke today with the president.""I have the confidence with the club that they do their job and I do my job.""Olmo, 26, a key contributor to Spain's Euro 2024 triumph, has shown excellent form since arriving from Leipzig, scoring five league goals.La Liga stated on Tuesday that ""Barcelona has presented no alternative"" that complies with league spending regulations to enable player registration.The potential loss of Olmo would significantly impact the third-placed Blaugrana's trophy aspirations this season, whilst adding to the club's series of administrative difficulties following years of financial mismanagement.","Hansi Flick expresses his discontent over Barcelona's potential departure of Dani Olmo.

Arteta stressed on Friday the importance of maintaining consistency as his team prepares for their Saturday fixture against Brighton.""We have to show the same level of consistency and a bit more, because the last year we have been the best team in the league, broken various records and still haven't won a major trophy, so something is missing,"" said the Spaniard.""It's going to be very thin, small details, you can pick up certain games and situations. But at the end, we're so close and we just have to flip that coin to the other side to make it happen. That's only going to happen if we do what we have to do and what we can control. The rest is out of our hands.""In their quest for their first Premier League title since 2004, Arsenal face a setback with Bukayo Saka 's hamstring injury, sidelining him until March following the Crystal Palace match.Regarding player rotation, Arteta stated: ""There's not one player that's going to play nine games in a row in that position, it's impossible.""He further noted: ""We need more threat, we need more players fit and rotation in that unit. In relation to that, we will make decisions and as well, players' performances, that's simple.""Regarding potential January transfers, Arteta remained noncommittal.""The focus is on the players that we have,"" he said.

Richard Masters , the Premier League's chief executive, has voiced concerns about the scheduling of the Club World Cup . He believes it could pose significant challenges for Manchester City and Chelsea 's preparations for the 2025/26 Premier League season.The expanded 32-team tournament, hosted by the United States, will feature both English clubs. Players' unions are considering legal action due to welfare concerns, and national leagues are worried about the impact on their own competitions.The Club World Cup final is scheduled for July 13th, 2025, while the Premier League season kicks off on August 16th.“The leagues and the players' unions are not happy with the decisions that are being taken at a global level.”Masters expressed his concerns to Sky Sports, highlighting the tight turnaround between the two competitions.“We've seen the Club World Cup come in, and obviously that is going to have an impact on the Premier League.”He explained the potential conflict between the Club World Cup schedule and players' contractual right to a three-week break.“If either Manchester City or Chelsea get to the final of that competition, the Premier League starts four weeks later, and all players are supposed to have three weeks off as part of the contractual commitment.”Masters questioned how this scheduling clash could be resolved.“So how does that work? With great difficulty I would say.”Shifting his focus to the financial state of English football , Masters dismissed suggestions of an impending crisis. He reiterated the Premier League's concerns about the possible ramifications of an independent regulator.During the 2023/24 season, the Premier League incurred legal costs exceeding £45 million ($56 million) defending its rules against challenges from clubs.Further significant legal expenses are anticipated this season due to the ongoing disciplinary case against Manchester City.The reigning champions face over 100 alleged breaches of the Premier League's financial rules, with charges brought in 2023.An independent commission concluded its hearings between September and December, and a verdict is now awaited.Manchester City has also contested the legality of the league's associated party transaction (APT) regulations. These regulations are designed to ensure fair market value in deals involving organizations connected to a club's ownership.Both the current and previous British governments have advocated for an independent regulator. The goal is to ensure the financial stability of clubs in the top five tiers of English football.However, Masters argued that excessive regulation could stifle the excitement that fuels the Premier League's success.“We have that jeopardy, we have that constant fizz of compelling entertainment.”He attributed the Premier League's global appeal to various factors, particularly its unpredictable nature.“There are many different reasons (for the Premier League's global popularity) but that, I think, is what separates us from others.”Masters emphasized the importance of investment in maintaining the league's competitive balance.“We have always been pro investment within measured risks. The Premier League is not a pension fund, it is a place where capital is put at risk. There is no certainty of outcome -- that is one of the things that makes it interesting.”He expressed apprehension that an independent regulator might prioritize risk aversion, hindering clubs' investment capacity.“We do worry that a new regulatory function might be risk-averse and might inhibit clubs' ability to invest. And the ability to invest is key to competitive balance, and that jeopardy that I'm talking about.”",Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has voiced concerns about the scheduling of the Club World Cup.

Liverpool and Manchester United , once English football's fiercest rivals, face each other at Anfield on Sunday. The two teams are currently on very different trajectories.Liverpool is at the top of both the Premier League and the Champions League . They aim to match Manchester United's record of 20 Premier League titles, and potentially achieve even more. In the last seven years, Liverpool has only lost once to United in the Premier League. Their most recent encounter was a 3-0 victory for Liverpool at Old Trafford in September.Manchester United finds itself closer to the relegation zone than the top of the table. This season has been another difficult one, marked by the departure of a manager and sporting director, and the sidelining of a key player.The growing disparity between the two clubs is stark. Liverpool is vying for a quadruple of trophies, while Manchester United is battling to avoid relegation. This begs the question: how did two of England's most successful teams end up on such divergent paths?Manchester United's decline has been evident since their record 20th title win in 2013, Alex Ferguson's final season as manager. The club hasn't come close to winning the league since his retirement. Ruben Amorim is the sixth permanent manager appointed in the past eleven years.David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and Erik ten Hag have all been unable to achieve consistent success at United. The constant managerial changes have hindered the club's progress, leading to frequent shifts in direction.Amorim has quickly grasped the scale of the challenge, having overseen six defeats in his last eight games. He acknowledged the possibility of a relegation battle this week.“It is a possibility,” he said. “We have to be clear with our fans.”While Manchester United has struggled to replace a legendary manager, Liverpool's transition appears to have been seamless.Arne Slot took on the challenging task of succeeding Jürgen Klopp at the end of the last season. He has since propelled the team to new heights.Klopp achieved significant success at Anfield, winning a complete set of trophies. His only obstacle to further Premier League titles was Pep Guardiola's Manchester City.Under Slot, Liverpool currently leads the Premier League by six points with a game in hand. They also hold a three-point lead in the Champions League and have reached the semi-finals of the English League Cup.Slot may have benefited from Manchester City's decline this season. However, Liverpool's record of 14 wins from 18 league games is impressive in any season.Manchester United has spent billions on player transfers, yet costly mistakes have outnumbered successful acquisitions.High-profile signings like Angel di Maria, Alexis Sanchez, Paul Pogba, Casemiro, and Jadon Sancho have failed to meet expectations. Recent additions, including Joshua Zirkzee and Matthijs de Ligt, have also struggled.If Amorim wants to bring in new players in January, he might have to sell some existing ones. Marcus Rashford, recently dropped from the team, could be a valuable asset to generate funds.In contrast, Liverpool has been one of the most astute operators in the transfer market in recent years. Their significant expenditures have generally been wise, with players like Virgil van Dijk and Alisson becoming key figures in their trophy wins. Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson were acquired for relatively modest fees.Under the ownership of Fenway Sports Group (FSG), the American conglomerate that also owns the Boston Red Sox, Liverpool has regained its prominence in English and European football, ending a 30-year wait for a Premier League title.Klopp's appointment was crucial to this success, but so was the contribution of sporting director Michael Edwards. Edwards played a key role in numerous successful transfers. He left in 2022 but has returned as FSG's chief executive of football and has helped to manage the transition to Slot.Manchester United's American owners, the Glazer family, have faced consistent fan protests since their leveraged buyout of the club in 2005.Last year, British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe made a minority investment in the club, which generated some optimism. He took charge of the club's football operations, but things haven't gone as planned.Erik ten Hag was dismissed just months after signing a contract extension, and sporting director Dan Ashworth left after less than six months. The signings made during Ratcliffe's first summer transfer window also appear questionable, with United currently 14th in the league, just seven points above the relegation zone.Liverpool is having an excellent season, but significant challenges remain.Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, and Trent Alexander-Arnold's contracts expire at the end of this season. Salah and Van Dijk are in their thirties, and there's disagreement over the length of the contracts Liverpool is willing to offer them. Alexander-Arnold has reportedly attracted interest from Real Madrid.Amorim's immediate priority is to improve Manchester United's performance. In the long term, his current squad seems ill-suited to his preferred playing style.","Liverpool and Manchester United are once English football's fiercest rivals.

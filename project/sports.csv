India face a critical decision regarding the fitness and availability of pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah and wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant for the upcoming fourth Test against England at Manchester. With the series at 2-1 in England's favour after India's 22-run loss at Lord's, the team's management, along with assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate, are weighing various factors as injuries hit the Indian camp.Team India assistant Ryan Ten Doeschate suggested Bumrah is likely to play in Manchester , given the series is on the line. ""We know we have got him for one of the last two Tests. It's pretty obvious that the series on the line now in Manchester so there will be a leaning towards playing him,"" he said.However, he added, the final decision will consider multiple factors, including weather conditions and strategy for both remaining Tests.""But again, we have got to look at all the factors: how many days of cricket are we going to get up there, what do we feel is our best chance of winning that game, and then how that fits in together with The Oval. And looking at the last two games holistically as part of the series,"" he noted.Another concern in the Indian camp is wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant's index finger injury from Lord's . While he managed to bat through pain, he couldn't keep wickets, with Dhruv Jurel stepping in.During the optional training session on Thursday, Pant stayed away from batting or keeping drills, instead opting for light workouts. There was no taping on his finger, but it's understood that the pain from impact still lingers.Ten Doeschate sounded hopeful, ""He (Pant) will bat in Manchester before the Test.""""Look, I don't think you're going to keep Rishabh out of the Test no matter what. He batted with quite a lot of pain in the third Test, and it's only going to get easier and easier on his finger. And keeping's obviously the last part of the process to make sure that he can keep. We don't want to go through that again where we have to replace the keeper halfway through innings,"" he added.He emphasised that while Jurel remains an option, a fit Pant would handle both batting and keeping duties. ""Jurel's in the equation, but I mean obviously if Rishabh's fit, he plays the next Test and does both,"" he noted.Adding to the team's injury worries, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh hurt his bowling hand during practice . The incident occurred while trying to stop a ball from Sai Sudharsan's bat. He was later seen with a bandaged left hand, and captain Shubman Gill indicated he might not be able to bat.Ten Doeschate provided an update on Arshdeep's condition: ""Yeah, he took a ball while he was bowling there, Sai had a ball and he tried to stop it and it's just a cut, so we have to see how bad the cut is.""""Obviously the medical team has taken him off to see a doctor and obviously if he needs stitches or doesn't need stitches that's going to be important to our planning for the next few days,"" he said.",Jasprit Bumrah and Rishabh Pant could miss the fourth Test against England. India lost the third Test by 22 runs at Lord's. The series is now 2-1 in England's favour.

Cricket may never reach football’s level in Italy, but to do something even close would mean a lot. Thomas Darcy

NEW DELHI: Forza Italia! Forza Italia! The chants still reverberate in the ears of Thomas Draca after Italy secured a historic qualification for the 2026 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. Italy booked their place in the mega event, set to be held in India and Sri Lanka, by defeating hosts Netherlands in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Europe Region Final.With the Italian flag draped over his shoulders and tears in his eyes, pacer Draca took a heartfelt victory lap around the Sportpark Westvliet in Voorburg, Netherlands. It was a deeply emotional moment — not just for Draca, but for all of Italy.Long celebrated as a football-mad nation that has produced legends like Alessandro Del Piero, Gianluigi Buffon, Andrea Pirlo, Franco Baresi, Paolo Maldini, Roberto Baggio and Francesco Totti, Italy is now scripting a new chapter — one that puts cricket on the national sporting map.For Draca, it's just the beginning — marking the start of a fresh era for cricket in Italy.""Honestly, I can't believe it. It's just all surreal at the moment. It's been a work in progress. And I think, you know, you look at our squad now — when we get our main squad in — we're excited and thrilled to be a part of it. But we're also thrilled to be able to compete at the international level. And that's what we all believe. That's the whole goal,"" Draca told TimesofIndia.com.""We know we'll be the underdogs, but it's more than just going to the World Cup. It's the start of something new. We've wanted to create a foundation for cricket - to inspire young kids to pick up a bat instead of just playing football at school. So for us, it's more than just qualifying for a World Cup. It's the start of something special,"" he said.Draca was just six years old when Italy lifted the FIFA World Cup in 2006 — their fourth title — after a 5–3 victory over France in a dramatic penalty shootout. The memories of that iconic win remain fresh for the right-arm pacer, who once dreamed of becoming a footballer.Playing in a World Cup had always been his childhood dream, but destiny had other plans. Now, he’s set to represent Italy on the global stage — not in football, but in cricket.""When we call Italy, the football stars come to mind. But this is the first time cricket is stepping up. There have been players who’ve been involved since the early 2000s. You look at Gareth Berg — he’s devoted much of his career to cricket in Italy. So, it’s not just the last year or two. Joe Burns made his debut in 2015. I actually met one of the early captains of Italy’s qualifying days. He came to the ground and told me, 'You’re one of my heroes. ' I was like, 'What do you mean?' And he said, 'I flew across to witness this special event.' He played back in 2016 when Italy was fighting to qualify for division cricket,"" he said.""Joe Burns keeps joking that I am the new Totti. And we’ve seen comments about how Italy couldn’t qualify for the Football World Cup, but here we are qualifying in cricket! For me, the 2006 Italy football team that won the World Cup was inspirational. I remember when they knocked Australia out, and I was always a football fan. I only started taking cricket seriously at 16. I played football growing up, so the Serie A legends have always been heroes. Cricket may never reach football’s level in Italy, but to do something even close would mean a lot.""As the team continues to celebrate their qualification for the T20 World Cup, Draca remains confident that this squad has something special — a unique spark — and believes they are capable of creating their own piece of history.""We’re representing a nation that’s still new to cricket, but we want to inspire the next generation. 10-20 years ago, that idea wouldn’t have existed. But now, it’s becoming a reality.""The Federation has always supported us — people like Peter and Michael Di Venuto played in the early 2000s. Gareth Berg’s been here since 2012–13. And now, we’ve got players in the peak of their careers, like Burns, the Manenti brothers (Ben Manenti and Harry Manenti), and Grant Stewart,"" the 24-year-old said.",Italy qualify for 2026 ICC Men's T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. Pacer Thomas Draca believes it's just the start of a fresh era for cricket in Italy.

Poll Which aspect of Suryavanshi's game impresses you the most? His aggressive batting style His composure under pressure

Vaibhav Suryavanshi

At 14, Vaibhav Suryavanshi has the world at his feet.While commentating in the second Test of the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, former India coach Ravi Shastri and ex-wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik unanimously predicted that the teenager is destined to play for the Indian senior team. Former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara, who is the Director of Cricket at Rajasthan Royals – the franchise Suryavanshi represents in the Indian Premier League (IPL) – revealed how the teen prodigy is already flooded with endorsement deals.Jos Buttler, who had the best seat in the house when Suryavanshi smoked a 35-ball 100 in a six-fest against Gujarat Titans in April, was floored by his bat swing and compared it to Yuvraj Singh and Brian Lara.Indeed, the teenager, who hails from Bihar's Samastipur district , is special.While the Indian men's team – led by Shubman Gill, once a prodigy himself – has cornered England's Bazballers in the ongoing five-match Test series , India’s women’s team has won a historic T20I series against England . And then there is the India U19 team, who are also making quite some noise on English soil.Suryavanshi played a crucial role in India U19's 3-1 series win over England U19 in the Youth ODIs. The swashbuckling opener amassed 355 runs at a strike rate of 174 while smashing 27 sixes . He then scored a crucial second-innings half-century in the Youth Test Daniel Peacock, a cricket analyst and statistician for the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), who has been covering the U19 series, shares how the teenager has already become a crowd-puller.“The first time I watched him in the flesh though, I do remember a real air of excitement at Northamptonshire for the second one-dayer – more photos, more press, the BBC had even come to see him play,” Peacock tells TimesofIndia.com.“I knew I was watching a serious star talent. He hit 86 from 31 in a 40-over game [reduced due to weather], which included six fours and nine sixes [match 3 at Northants]. He got a standing ovation after pulling the pacer Sebastian Morgan to backward square leg. The PA announcer, when announcing his score after the dismissal, said: ‘I think we will be seeing a lot more of this boy play.’”“Then at New Road, home of Worcestershire, in a near-perfect all-round performance, he strutted comfortably to 143 off 78 balls. By the time he walked off after being caught in the deep to spin, I think everyone inside the venue had long realised they had just witnessed something really special.”In the ongoing series, there are plenty of youngsters from both sides who are tipped to play for the senior teams in the future. Suryavanshi is at the top. His opening partner, Ayush Mhatre, who had a tough outing in the ODIs, scored a beautiful century in the Youth Test.On the opposite side are Archie Vaughan and Rocky Flintoff – sons of former England captains Michael Vaughan and Andrew Flintoff, respectively, who are touted to be the next big things in English cricket.Suryavanshi’s IPL franchise Rajasthan Royals shared images of fans who drove six hours just to meet the youngster , and Peacock vouches for it, saying the current U19 series is getting more media attention only because of him.“People are starting to make noise about him here. Cricket fans already know who he is – even if they can’t all pronounce his name. These games usually attract a few die-hards, but there’s certainly been a little extra media attention (we’ve had the likes of BBC, The Athletic, Getty, etc.), and a lot of British-Indians have come to watch Vaibhav play in the flesh for the first time,” he said.“I’m sure it won’t be too long until he’s playing at the highest level – Test and international cricket. When he does make his debut and starts scoring big, everyone in the world will know who he is.”There’s already plenty of hype around the youngster, with some calling him the next Sachin Tendulkar or Virat Kohli . But, absurdly, is it plausible that he can achieve even bigger things?“The people I’ve spoken to in the game – I think we all have the same feeling. We’ve watched and witnessed a young star in the making, something very special. I would go as far as to say he’s probably the best 14-year-old in any sport that I’ve seen live. I think the sentiment in England is that we are watching a very special young boy playing cricket – and the expectancy is Tendulkar-Kohli-level, or even beyond,” said Peacock.",14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi shot to fame by becoming the youngest player and century-maker in the Indian Premier League earlier this year.

Bombay Sport Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

The International Cricket Council's Annual Conference in Singapore kicked off Thursday with a significant election that saw Gurumurthy Palani (France), Anuraag Bhatnagar (Hong Kong), and Gurdeep Klair (Canada) winning key positions on the Chief Executives' Committee (CEC). The trio emerged victorious from an eight-candidate field, marking a major shift in cricket's global leadership.Palani and Bhatnagar led the pack with 28 votes, while Klair secured 21 votes. The election results brought a notable change as veteran administrator Sumod Damodar, who previously served three terms, failed to retain his position after receiving only 16 votes.The election drew significant attention as three Associate Member seats were available on the influential CEC. This committee plays a crucial role in developing cricket worldwide and managing the sport at the international level. For Associate cricket chiefs, a spot on the CEC is highly valued and often serves as a pathway to the more powerful ICC board.The election featured a diverse group of candidates, including former Hong Kong chief Tim Cutler representing Vanuatu, ex-USA cricket administrator Sankar Renganathan from Sierra Leone, Stella Siale from Samoa, and Sarah Gomersall from Jersey.Two previous committee members, Rashpal Bajwa from Canada and Denmark's Umair Butt, chose not to participate in this election.The outgoing member, Damodar, was known for his bold initiatives, including attempts to revive the Afro-Asia Cup and his advocacy for more major events for Associate nations. Another notable candidate was Renganathan, who gained attention for his vocal criticism of USA Cricket's current challenges.The voting process involved 40 Associate Members and five regional representatives from the Americas, Asia, Europe, East Asia-Pacific, and Africa. According to ICC rules, candidates needed to be either an Associate Member representative or have experience as an ICC director.The newly elected members will serve two-year terms and will also participate in the Associate Member Committee, which oversees governance at the Associate level. This election marks the beginning of a new era for the ICC, now led by Chairman Jay Shah and new CEO Sanjog Gupta, with several important issues set to be discussed during the conference.","Gurumurthy Palani (France), Anuraag Bhatnagar (Hong Kong), and Gurdeep Klair (Canada) won key positions on the Chief Executives' Committee.

Poll How do you feel about India's batting performance in the third Test against England? Disappointed Satisfied

NEW DELHI: Following India’s narrow loss at Lord’s in the third Test against England, former India captain Sourav Ganguly shared his views on the defeat, pointing out the missed opportunity despite the batting depth in the side. He also lauded Ravindra Jadeja for his resilient knock, backed by tailenders Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj in a tense finish.India suffered one of their most heartbreaking Test defeats in recent times, going down by 22 runs and falling 1-2 behind in the five-match series. Chasing 193, India were in deep trouble at 82/7 before Jadeja launched a fightback with help from Nitish Kumar Reddy, Bumrah, and Siraj. The last two batters faced a combined 84 deliveries but could only add nine runs. Siraj was eventually bowled in unfortunate fashion, ending India’s spirited chase.Speaking during a press event of the 2025 season Indian Racing Festival (IRF) Driver Draft, Ganguly admitted he was “a little bit disappointed” with India’s batting, given their performances earlier in the series.""They should have got this 190, and when you saw Jadeja guts it out and fight and score the runs, the batting quality in this team is absolutely brilliant, and I think they will be more disappointed than I am because it was an opportunity to get 2-1 up in the series against England.Two more matches to go. I am sure they have left disappointed not getting 190. Especially with the quality of batsmanship there is in the dressing room. ""Ganguly added that even a small contribution from the top-order could have made the difference in India’s favour.""Sad from a team's point of view, but Jadeja has been exceptional. He is going to continue to play for India as long as he bats and performs like this. He has been around for a long time. Almost 80 Test matches and more than 200 one-day games.""""And now you can see if batting, bowling, fielding, you know, he's a special player and his batting has really improved over the years with experience and quality. He was actually a top-order batsmen for Saurashtra in his younger days and then became a left-arm spinner. So he has a special player and is a very important part of this team,"" he concluded.During the match, Jadeja also crossed a significant milestone by completing 7,000 international runs. In 361 appearances for India, he has scored 7,018 runs at an average of 33.41, including four centuries and 39 fifties in 302 innings, with a highest score of 175*.In Test cricket, Jadeja has scored 3,697 runs in 83 matches at an average of 36.97, including four hundreds and 26 fifties. His top score of 175* came in this format, which remains his most productive with the bat. So far in this series, he has scored 327 runs in six innings at a staggering average of 109.00, with four fifties and a top score of 89. He is currently the fifth-highest run-scorer in the series.",India lost the third Test against England by 22 runs at Lord's.

Bihar's 14-year-old cricket prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi made history on Sunday (July 13) by becoming the youngest Indian to take a wicket in a Youth Test match during India Under-19's ongoing game against England at the Kent County Cricket Ground in Beckenham.At 14 years and 107 days, Suryavanshi claimed the wicket of England captain Hamza Shaikh, marking his place as the third-youngest bowler overall to achieve this feat in Youth Test cricket.The young left-arm spinner's breakthrough came in the 45th over when Shaikh miscued a full-toss outside off-stump, resulting in a catch by Henil Patel at long-off. This dismissal broke a crucial 154-run partnership between Shaikh and Rocky Flintoff.Suryavanshi's record surpassed the previous Indian mark set by Jharkhand's Manishi, who took wickets against South Africa in Thiruvananthapuram in 2019 at just over 15 years of age. In the overall rankings, Suryavanshi stands third, behind two Pakistani players - Mahmood Malik and Hidayatullah Khan, who achieved their records at 13 years of age.As England posted 439 on the board, Suryavanshi posted figures of 2/35 in 13 overs.After Shaikh's wicket, the Indian youngster got rid of wicketkeeper Thomas Rew, who tried to cut the outside-off delivery but ended up edging it behind to Abhigyan Kundu.The match has seen India establish a commanding position after posting a substantial first innings total of 540. England's Under-19 team responded with 439 runs, to give India a 101 run lead.At stumps on Day 3, India had moved to 128/3, with Vaibhav Suryavanshi scoring a 44-ball 56, with the lead extending to 229 runs.The fourth Test finished in a draw after England held on thanks to a battling century from captain Hamza Shaikh.","Bihar's Vaibhav Suryavanshi takes two wicket haul in India's Youth Test vs England U19.

Poll Who has been the standout bowler for India in the current Test series? Jasprit Bumrah Mohammed Siraj

Even before the Indian cricket team landed on English shores, the one name that has dominated conversations is Jasprit Bumrah . From his menacing bowling to his workload management, the Indian spearhead has been the talk of the series.Bumrah has played two Tests in this series and picked up 12 wickets so far.Although Bumrah is the face of the Indian bowling attack, assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate has showered praise on Mohammed Siraj , calling him a “lion.”Siraj has played all three Test matches and has taken 14 wickets. The numbers don’t do justice to the way the 31-year-old has bowled in the last two Tests—he has bowled his heart out.“Let’s first start with Siraj before we talk about Bumrah. I think we sort of take for granted how lucky we are to have someone like that,” said ten Doeschate.“I know he doesn’t always have the returns you expect from a fast bowler. But in terms of heart, he’s like a lion.“And what he brings to this bowling attack—whenever he has the ball in hand—you always feel like something’s going to happen.“He’s not someone who’s going to shy away from the workload. So it becomes even more important for us to manage his workload and ensure that he’s at least fit enough to give his best.”",Jasprit Bumrah has been the standout bowler for India in the current Test series.

Poll Do you think Arshdeep Singh will be fit to play in the fourth Test? Yes No

Team India on Thursday was hit with a fresh injury concern. Left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh sustained a cut on his bowling hand during a net session in Manchester, India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate told reporters.The incident occurred when Arshdeep attempted to stop a shot from Sai Sudharsan during his follow-through. The medical team examined the 26-year-old after training to assess whether stitches would be necessary.“We have to see how bad the cut is,” said ten Doeschate.“Obviously, the medical team is taking him to see a doctor. And whether he needs stitches or not is going to be important to our planning for the next few days,” he added.Although Arshdeep is yet to make his Test debut, he was being considered as a potential replacement if the team opted to rest a frontline pacer for the fourth Test in Manchester.Ten Doeschate also hinted that the team combination for the Old Trafford Test now hinges on the severity of Arshdeep’s injury.“We’ll take a call on the combination we play,” he said.“Particularly given the Arshdeep situation as well, we’ll make that call closer to Manchester,” he added.The fourth Test between India and England will be played at Old Trafford in Manchester, starting July 23.","Arshdeep Singh sustained a cut on his bowling hand during a net session in Manchester.

Poll Should Rishabh Pant play in the 4th Test despite his finger injury? Yes, he's crucial for the team No, better to rest and recover

Team India assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate on Thursday confirmed that Rishabh Pant is getting closer to regaining full fitness ahead of the fourth Test match against England, starting from July 23 at Old Trafford.“He will bat in Manchester before the Test. Look, I don't think it's going to keep Rishabh out of the Test, no matter what,” ten Doeschate told reporters.“He batted with quite a lot of pain in the third Test, and it’s only going to get easier and easier on his finger,” he said.On the first day of the Lord’s Test, Pant suffered an injury after diving to pick up the ball but could not collect it cleanly. Following that, he was seen in a lot of pain and had to leave the field for medical attention.Dhruv Jurel took the field as he replaced Pant as the wicketkeeper during the second session of the first day of the Test match. Despite the finger injury, Pant batted in both innings and made a brilliant 74.The assistant coach, however, said whether Pant will keep or not is a decision the team still needs to make.“Keeping is obviously the last part of the process to make sure that he can keep. We don’t want to go through that again, where we have to replace the keeper after three innings.“But yeah, he rested today.

Team India hit the nets on Thursday, eager to bounce back from their narrow 22-run defeat at Lord’s, but the preparation session brought fresh worries.Left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh injured his bowling hand during practice, adding to India’s growing list of concerns ahead of the fourth Test in Manchester, starting July 23.The visitors already trail 1-2 in the five-match series and must win both remaining Tests to seal the series.However, uncertainty looms over Jasprit Bumrah’s availability.

TOI Sports reporter attacked in London: After Lord's Test, reporter faces 'scariest moment of his life'

Former England fast bowler Stuart Broad has slammed India opener Yashasvi Jaiswal for his poor shot selection at Lord's in the second innings.“So Jaiswal getting out, really bad shot, I’m surprised He just didn’t look to cut it over the off-side, suddenly England are like okay, we are in. He is the player who moves the scoreboard forward,” Stuart Broad said on ‘For The Love Of Cricket’ podcast.""In a low chase, when you are defending, if you come to bowl and you’ve got a Sehwag, Warner, the opening batters that can take the game away from you and they up 60 for none or one off ten, the game is sort of done,” he added.Broad then explained why Jaiswal's wicket opened the gate for England.“As soon as Karun Nair came in, he is someone who plays each ball on merit, then England could control it and set attacking fields, create pressure. So I thought that was a really big moment. England making that breakthrough early, Jaiswal gone,” Broad said.India lost the Lord's Test by 22 runs.

Everything that I am, the things I've been able to achieve have been possible because of my mom, who's quietly just ridden this crazy ride with me and I can't thank god enough for giving her as my mom.""In her final season, she played for Sribhumi FC, helping the Kolkata team secure third place in the IWL.""As I now step into life beyond the pitch, I carry that belief with me – not as a player anymore, but as someone committed to building a stronger pathway and ecosystem for the next generation.""My second half is about giving back to the game that gave me everything.""The formula remains the same: dream big, believe in yourself, and put in the work.""","Aditi Chauhan, the first Indian woman to play professional football in Europe, has announced her retirement after a 17-year career.

'When the period hits, it's difficult'

Poll What do you think is the most important factor in Garhwal FC's success? Strong team spirit Effective coaching Commitment to training Supportive infrastructure

NEW DELHI: 25 young female footballers sharing seven rooms in a Noida apartment doesn't paint a pretty picture, does it? Along with the staff, they cook their food, train every day, and live like a family.This is the home of Garhwal FC, a women’s team from Delhi that just completed an unbeaten domestic season, winning all 24 of their matches across three tournaments.Even when big sponsors, camps abroad or a share of the spotlight are alien to them, their coach Akshay Unni's five-year plan to lead Garhwal FC to the top division, Indian Women’s League (IWL), has come to fruition a year before schedule, culminating in an inspirational four years from finishing second-last in the Delhi Women's League to now preparing to go toe-toe with the best teams in the country.Despite a ""very bad"" back injury ending his playing days and forcing him to work in a corporate job, Akshay eventually chose to follow his passion.Troubled with the pain of his injury, even after opting for a career far from the football pitch, Akshay says, “If I have to suffer anyway, why not do something I love?”“From day one, it was not just about football. It was about making better people.If we get that right, football becomes easier to teach,” Akshay, who started working with Bhaichung Bhutia Football Schools (BBFS) back in 2017, coaching kids aged 6 to 10 and later training the IIT Delhi football team, adds.From qualifying for the Indian Women’s League to not dropping a single game, the side has scripted history in its own way, almost eight years after Akshay made the switch from advertising to football coaching.It all started in 2021, when Akshay got the opportunity to take charge of the Garhwal FC women’s team, a BBFS-affiliated club. With a minute budget of Rs. 10–15k, he kicked off his journey.“But I was given full freedom,” he recalls. “No one told me what to do. They just said, ‘It’s yours. Build it.’”Though, the results did not follow the anticipation, with the team finishing second-last in the league that year. BBFS had centres across India, and in them, he saw the potential to build a team that stood a fighting chance.Fast forward to another season, and the team finished second in the Delhi League.“The girls had to travel 2–3 hours to reach training,” he remembers. “We didn’t have the best accommodation. But we had belief. And the girls knew — wherever they went, we went with them. That trust kept us going.”In 2023, when Garhwal FC came heartbreakingly close to qualifying for the second division of the Indian Women’s League (IWL), captain Sanfida Nongrum, a 20-year-old midfielder, echoed the same drive and determination, akin to the rest of her teammates.Speaking to TimesofIndia.com, the No. 10 said, ""In 2023, we lost by one point because we took it very casually. We learnt from that. I'm glad that we lost, because we got to learn.""She highlighted the L&D (Learning and Discussion) sessions, a two-hour session every Wednesday, where the CEO, Kishore Taid, comes to have discussions on ownership, honesty, trust, happiness, and anyone can ask anything.The change in mindset wasn’t just restricted to their captain. The other players, too, made changes. They gave up junk food, cut down on sugar and limited their screen time to under two hours per day for four months.With players from across the country, their residence in Noida is a melting pot of cultures. Sanifda, who only learnt Hindi in the last six months or so, now also knows a lot of Bihari, owing to the songs played on loop by her friend and teammate Shruti, who is from Bihar.The 2024 season is where everything clicked for them. Garhwal FC won all 24 matches they played across the Delhi Futsal League, Delhi Women’s League, and IWL 2.To put their dominance and technical superiority into context, it is the respective state champions that participate in the IWL 2, where they played 8, won all 8, scored 28 and conceded just once.Striker Lhingdeikim ended the season as top scorer, bagging an impressive 12 goals in the IWL 2 and as many in the Delhi Women’s League.What’s more? Many of the players who joined as teenagers are now 18, and seven of them are in India’s U-21 team. “What was the first vision? We can actually develop young girls to develop this club and make them reach India level,” the manager explains.When asked about what the toughest part of his team’s inspirational journey was, 'staying consistent' was the immediate answer.“It’s easy to say you’ll quit sugar or train every day. But after two days, you realise it's difficult. That’s the hard part,” he notes.As a coach, his role isn't restricted to the pitch and training sessions either.“Everybody came from different backgrounds, so we had girls from 10 states. They will be motivated for 20 days of the month, but when the period hits, it's going to be difficult. For the first 2-3 days, you will have to let them cut off, and you cannot push them when they aren’t at their best,” the coach adds.“Three or four girls cry in front of me every other day. My job as a coach or my team's job as staff officials was to, without scolding them or being hard on them, how can we make them understand,” added Akshay.Now, Garhwal are preparing for their biggest challenge yet, competing in the Indian Women’s League. It’s a tougher format with home and away matches and considerably stronger teams.After all, in the coach's words, to teach them (his players) to be good human beings is the priority. Playing good football is a by-product.","Garhwal FC, a women's team from Delhi, just completed an unbeaten domestic season. They won all 24 of their matches across three tournaments. Coach Akshay Unni's five-year plan to lead them to the top division, Indian Women’s League (IWL), has come to fruition.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122648381,imgsize-165210,width-400,resizemode-4/122648381.jpg"

Lamine Yamal, just days after turning 18, was officially unveiled as the new heir to the iconic No 10 at FC Barcelona. The storied history of the Spanish side is only furthered by the legendary stars that have donned the Blaugrana colours over the years. With 18-year-old Lamine Yamal becoming the new No 10 for Hansi Flick's side, as confirmed by posts on the club's social media handles, here's a closer look at the history of the No 10 jersey.Ansu Fati was the last Barcelona player to wear the jersey at the club, after he took over from Lionel Messi back in 2021. However, the player has largely been unable to make a name for himself and after recurring injuries and poor form, has now been loaned out to French side AS Monaco. Fati's failure to emulate previous legends who wore the No 10 only highlights the extreme pressure of expectations that come along with it.Yamal, after taking over the number in an event held at the club shop at Spotify Camp Nou, said, ""Messi made his path and I will make mine."" The 18-year-old recently came under fire in the media for reportedly hiring people with dwarfism as entertainers for his birthday party. However, he responded to the same by saying, ""When I'm away from (the club) I enjoy my life, and that's all.""So, as Lamine Yamal takes the next big step in his way to becoming an indispensable and iconic figure in the history of the club, here are the last five players to have worn Barcelona's iconic number 10:Tipped as Messi’s successor, Fati took the No 10 shirt in 2021. Despite flashes of brilliance, injuries derailed his progress. After several stop-start campaigns with the club, he has now been loaned out to Ligue 1 side AS Monaco. He was previously loaned to Brighton in the Premier League.Arguably the greatest player in the club’s history, Messi wore the No 10 for over a decade and redefined what it meant at Barça. He is the recipient of a record eight Ballon d'Or awards and remains the player to have worn the No 10 for the longest time in the club's history. Messi's 672 goals in 778 appearances remains the most goals by a player for a single club in history.The Brazilian magician brought joy and flair to the Camp Nou, playing a key role in Barça’s revival in the early 2000s. He took over the iconic number in 2003 and wore it till 2008. Ronaldinho is considered to be one of the most skillful and flashy players in the history of the club.The Argentine playmaker spent a brief spell at the club, known for his technique and vision during a transitional phase for the club.A former Ballon d'Or winner, Rivaldo thrilled fans with his powerful left foot and memorable goals, including his famous overhead kick against Valencia in La Liga back in 2001. He left the club in the summer of 2002.With a long list of legends and expectations to match, it remains to be seen whether the added weight of the number 10 will galvanize the 18-year-old or become a hindrance in the player's pursuit for greatness.",Lamine Yamal has been unveiled as the new No 10 at FC Barcelona.

Poll Do you think Lamine Yamal can live up to the legacy of Lionel Messi in the number 10 shirt? Yes, he has the talent. No, that's a huge expectation.

Wearing the number 10 for FC Barcelona is one of the most prestigious and demanding responsibilities at the same time. Lamine Yamal has done just that, as he took over the number 10 shirt at Barcelona, previously worn by club legend Lionel Messi. The 18-year-old winger, already a key player for the Catalan side, made the switch official at an event held at the club shop at Spotify Camp Nou.""Messi made his path and I will make mine,"" said Yamal. ""I will work as hard as I can, give everything and try to make those Barca fans who are there happy and those who are at home.""Yamal, a La Masia graduate like Messi, helped Barcelona to a domestic treble last season and signed a contract extension until 2031 in May, becoming one of the club’s highest-paid players.""I hope to enjoy myself more than last year and make my dreams come true,"" he added. Yamal expressed his desire to win both the Champions League with Barcelona and the World Cup with Spain.Having debuted in 2023 at just 15 years old in the number 41 shirt, Yamal has already made over 100 appearances and scored 25 goals for the club. He wore number 27 last season before switching to 19, which was Messi’s shirt number in the Argentine's early years at the club.""Barca is my life, I've been here since I was seven, for all kids from La Masia their dream is to make it to the first team and I'm doing it and I have to keep working,"" said Yamal. ""When I was little I dreamed of being at Barca and having this numbe,."" said the player to reporters, as quoted by AFP.Ansu Fati had previously worn the number 10 shirt after Messi’s 2021 departure, but injuries curtailed his impact, and he recently joined Monaco on loan.""(Messi, Maradona, Ronaldinho) are three legends of football, three legends of this club,"" Yamal said. ""I am grateful for what they gave the club and I will try to continue this legacy.""The youngster also responded to recent scrutiny over his birthday celebration: ""In the end I work for Barca, I play for Barca, but when I'm away from (the club) I enjoy my life, and that's all.""The player has been the center of attention for reportedly hiring people with dwarfism as entertainers for his 18th birthday party.

Raman Vijayan named Gokulam Kerala women’s team head coach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/raman-vijayan-named-gokulam-kerala-womens-team-head-coach/articleshow/122591282.cms,"Raman Vijayan (right) with N Sivasakthi

CHENNAI: Former India men’s international Raman Vijayan has forayed into women’s football. Vijayan was on Wednesday appointed the head coach of three-time Indian Women’s League (IWL) champions Gokulam Kerala FC.While ending Gokulam’s IWL trophy wait is high on the Tamil Nadu man’s agenda – they finished runners-up in the last two seasons – he is approaching the task with a broader view. The upcoming IWL season is likely to run from September to January.“Every management recruits a coach with the target of winning a title, so it (bagging the IWL trophy) is the primary goal. But I am looking beyond that,” Vijayan, who last served as the assistant coach of Indian Super League (ISL) club Chennaiyin FC, told TOI.“In the last few years, teams with good squads went on to win the IWL; the results were based on the strength of the squads. I would like to create a difference there. I want to play an attacking brand of football irrespective of the personnel we have. People must look at our team and say: ‘Can girls deliver such a style?’ I will put in all the effort to achieve it. To get there, support from the club and continuity are important,” said the former India forward.Vijayan’s lack of coaching experience in women’s football is not proving to be a hindrance as he strives to turn into a “trend-setter”. Add to it the fact that he will be the chief coach of a top-level team for the first time in his career.“My ambition is to deliver proper football; more than winning titles and matches, I want to introduce a trend that Indian women’s football has never seen. It should help Indian football on the whole as well; I want to create a team from which about five players can go and play for the national team in the future,” added Vijayan.On why he chose to venture into the women’s game, Vijayan said: “I had offers to become an assistant coach again, but I decided that I would only take up head coach’s role upon returning from a break (he was away since the end of the 2023-24 season). I was fine with the I-League or IWL. Indian women’s football has been on the rise recently, so I felt that it was the right time to take up a role in the IWL.”",Raman Vijayan appointed head coach of three-time Indian Women's League champions Gokulam Kerala FC.

Poll Do you believe that Indian football will resume soon? Yes, definitely No, the situation is too complicated

With the future of Indian football pending resolution and the upcoming season suspended indefinitely, Sunil Chhetri has stepped up to address growing anxiety across the footballing community. The 40-year-old took to social media with a heartfelt message directed at the players, support staff, and all those whose livelihoods depend on the sport.The Indian Super League (ISL), which was set to begin pre-season shortly, has been put on hold amid ongoing discussions between the All India Football Federation (AIFF) and its commercial partners over the league's structure and finances. The delay, which began as a two-week postponement, has now stretched into an indefinite suspension, triggering concern and confusion across clubs.Chhetri began his post on a X with a light note, writing, "" When my phone went off a few weeks ago informing us of a delay in pre-season by a fortnight, I must admit it made me smile. And that’s because I was on vacation, hadn’t moved as much as I would have liked to, and hadn’t been eating as clean as I usually do. I had more time than I had bargained to get in shape.""""But that smile didn’t last. That ‘fortnight’ has now changed to ‘indefinitely’ and that smile’s been wiped out.It began with worrying about how I am on borrowed time with what I have left in the tank. But speaking with players from across clubs, I’ve realised that my selfish problem isn’t as important.""The veteran striker admitted that concern is widespread, not just among footballers but across the vast network of backroom staff that keeps the league running .""Everybody in the Indian football ecosystem is worried, hurt, scared about the uncertainty we are faced with,"" he wrote.Acknowledging the efforts being made by the administrators, Chhetri remained hopeful for a resolution.""I know that the think tank and all those involved in running the sport are working to get the football season up and running, and I’m hopeful that there is a solid fix sooner rather than later.""The player once again called for calm and perseverance, saying that football 'will' resume soon in the country.""I may not have all the answers, but my message to all those involved with Indian football – and more importantly the ones whose livelihood depends on it… please stay calm.

TOI

You have had a lot of achievements in your personal and club career. But a trophy with Norway has evaded you so far. How important is that for you and do you think this Euros can change that?

What are going to be the challenges for your team against higher-ranked Italy in the quarters?

You have been a spokesperson for equal rights and pay for women’s footballers and even stayed out of the national team in protest for a few years. Do you think a lot has been achieved in Norway, Europe and around the world in that respect?

What has been the most memorable moment in your decorated career so far?

The Indian women’s football team has a chance to qualify for the World Cup through the Asian Cup. What do you think about that?

Being a top footballer who is also an activist for the women’s game, do you believe activism and professional football go hand in hand?

(Fancode is the official broadcaster of Women’s Euro 2025)

There’s been no stopping Ada Hegerberg since she began playing top-division football at the age of 15. No woman European footballer has reached the level that she has with OL Lyonesse – winning six French league titles, five Coupes de France and five Champions Leagues so far. The first recipient of the Women’s Ballon d’Or in 2018 is also the only footballer with a hat-trick in a Champions League final.Ahead of Norway’s Euro quarterfinal against Italy at Stade de Genève in in Lancy, Canton of Geneva, Switzerland, on Wednesday, the captain, in a freewheeling chat with, spoke about her dreams for a title with the national team, her continued strive for women’s equality and the implication of Indian women making it to the continental stage, and on the world stage someday. Excerpts:Well, we were very close in 2013. We went to the final and we could have been European champs. Yes, I would love to do well for Norway, and I feel we couldn’t be in a better position than we are now to do that. Sometimes, we need to take into account that we’re a very small country of 5.5 million and we’re going to play a quarterfinal in the Euros. And the way we got there makes me incredibly proud of the girls because we’ve been working very hard to get to where we are at the moment, and now I think you need to enjoy it.But standing here after three games, winning all three, is a fantastic situation to be in. So, you kind of pinch yourself sometimes and feel grateful. And I feel very positive going into this quarterfinal.First, we respect Italy a lot. They have a good team, they’re very stable, they have good players, they’ve had good results coming into the Euro, so no game is going to be easy. And that’s the kind of mentality we have as well — that you must fight for every point and every ball. And it’s a big, big country we’re playing against. But at the same time, we must go into the game with belief in ourselves, positivity and will to fight for our country, for our teammates. And I hope we get a lot of Norwegians that we managed to engage behind us. It’s a big moment for us. So, it’s going to be challenging, but I hope we enjoy every minute of it.Throughout my career, I would say that development has been incredible. You have to be honest about that. But it’s always about making sure that we take the next step in the right direction. And sometimes I think you need to be alert about which decisions are being made for your sports on a national level. In Norway, Lise Klaveness becoming the federation president has been of huge importance. She’s a very impressive Norwegian woman who stands for lots of positives and backs women’s football fully. So, I feel like we’re heard and seen by our leader in Norwegian football. And I think having characters like her is hugely important for the sport because it’s all about taking the right decisions and you need people on top to take them for us. But as a player, you just want the sport to be in a better position than what you found it to be in. And I think in my time in the game, a lot of things have happened. But we still have to fight for things to change. We’re not there yet, but we’re on our way and we have to stand together and make sure it happens together.Oh, I feel very lucky. It’s hard to pick one. I think I’m going to take a step back when I have retired and look at this crazy career. What a journey it’s been — the highest of highs, the lowest of lows. All those Champions League finals have been absolutely some of the best memories. Scoring a hat-trick in a Champions League final is unheard of. And, at the same time, representing Norway is a huge thing for me. Something that makes me feel proud is seeing young girls and boys coming to our games and cheering for us. That’s what drives us as footballers — seeing the next generation get inspired.India is such a big nation. Imagine how many girls want the opportunity to do what they love and play the beautiful game. So, obviously, having the Indian women’s national team at the top stage representing India, there’s nothing better for the next generation of girls growing up. It’s a way of educating society as well. So, it’s huge. And with the huge population of India, imagine all the talent that is everywhere. And once you take care of that talent, the things you can achieve over time are limitless.I think I realised quite a long time ago that being a woman’s footballer and not fighting for equality is impossible. I think it’s a challenge because it brings a lot of responsibility. But it’s totally worth it. I see the change and the impact we can have. Obviously, if you don’t perform, you won’t have that voice, either. So, it’s always performance first and then I think of what can I do to have an impact on my own sports? What can I do to have an impact on the next generation growing up? Once I’m done in the game, there’s going to be new ones. Being brilliant in the game, taking on that responsibility, and it’s going to continue. That’s the cycle of life. It’s the way of history and women’s equality. It will always be a constant discussion, constant battle, and it can be tiring and very challenging. But it’s worth it and needs to be done.","Ada Hegerberg is the first recipient of the Women’s Ballon d’Or in 2018. She is also the only footballer with a hat-trick in a Champions League final.

Oliver Rowland was worried after how Round 13 turned out in Berlin

Formula E Berlin Round 14 – 60‑Second Blitz!

Pascal Wehrlein’s Round 14 performance sealed Oliver Rowland’s championship win

Oliver Rowland looking forward to his home race now



Oliver Rowland’s fans kept their fingers crossed and waited with bated breath for the Nissan driver to seal his Formula E World Championship at the Round 13 race in Berlin on Saturday. But the day ended on a sad note for the driver as he failed to even finish the race, while his closest competitor, Pascal Wehrlein, clinched second spot on the podium, closing the gap between them in the Formula E Driver Standings. Rowland has confirmed that he did doubt his championship win when things didn’t play out well that day.There was reason to be worried for Nissan driver Oliver Rowland when TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein closed the gap between them in the Driver Standings to 50 points. He was second in the Formula E Driver Standings and could have changed the championship outcome with two more races remaining in the season.Sharing his fears in an interview with Formula E, he said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday) I was more worried that it might never come.”Pascal Wehrlein ended 15th in the Round 14 race on Sunday despite starting from pole position.Rowland eventually bounced back to finally seal his championship win by finishing fourth in the race. He missed out on the podium, which had Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy as the winner, but his 12 points, along with his closest competitor Pascal Wehrlein’s disappointing performance, were enough for him to clinch the championship.“I wasn't aware of where Pascal was at all. My engineer came on, I think with four or five laps to go, and said ‘P4 is good,’ and I thought that's a bit weird. Then I looked at the TV screen, and I got to about eighth, and I thought, ‘Oh, he's not in the top eight then.’ The next time I came around looking again, I found him when I started from the bottom. I didn't know if he'd had a problem, so then I was aware that fourth would be enough if Wehrlein didn't score, so I knew that myself. I didn't want to ask, because I didn't want to jinx anything,” he said.Oliver Rowland took to Instagram on Wednesday to share a post to mark his Formula E Championship win. Sharing a few pictures of his celebrations with his team, the Nissan driver wrote: “2025 FIA FORMULA E WORLD CHAMPION! It still hasn’t quite sunk in what we have achieved this season. I couldn’t have imagined being in this position 2 years ago! Thank you to my incredible team @nismo & everyone that’s supported me!

This marked his second podium of the season, following his third-place finish in Monaco. Dennis shared his thoughts after the race in Berlin, which also saw Nissan driver Oliver Rowland clinch the Formula E World Championship title.Just a day earlier, Dennis had retired from Round 13 due to technical issues with his car.

Awesome race for us and perfectly executed! Great job by the whole team! A moment to say congrats to @oliverrowland1! So happy for you mate, world class all year! World champion looks good on you!”Speaking after the race, Dennis reflected on his recent struggles, having finished 17th in consecutive races leading up to Berlin.“We had a really good race car and the strategy we took into the race was perfectly executed. I had every opportunity to win this race, and we got pretty close. I’m not too surprised to be up here — I’m just super happy for myself and for the team. We’ve been on a real bad luck streak recently, so to reward them with a P2 is the least I could do,” he said.Looking ahead to his home race in London, which also serves as the Season 11 Formula E finale, Dennis said, “I’m excited to have this little boost going into the final stretch, my home race in London. It’s needed. It’s more for morale. Oliver [Rowland] has already won the championship, so massive congratulations to him. I’m super happy for him, he’s a good friend of mine.”Also Read: Nick Cassidy on Berlin E-Prix win: “I don’t want to take the moment from Oliver Rowland” Jake Dennis currently sits tenth in the 2025 Formula E Drivers' Standings with 77 points.

Pascal Wehrlein clinches podium in Berlin Round 13

Pascal Wehrlein fights to secure his position in Formula E Driver Standings

It was a special day for German driver Pascal Wehrlein at his home race, the Berlin E-Prix, on Saturday. Despite facing a three-place grid penalty, the TAG Heuer Porsche driver delivered a stellar performance to reach the podium. Wehrlein, driving car No. 94, finished second in Round 13 at the Tempelhof Airport Circuit and celebrated the moment with his daughter on stage.Pascal Wehrlein secured his fifth podium of the season at the Berlin E-Prix on Saturday, overcoming a grid penalty received for colliding with teammate Antonio Felix Da Costa during FP1 on Friday. He also earned extra points for setting the fastest lap in the race.After the event, Wehrlein shared several photos on Instagram, including a heartwarming one of him holding his daughter. He captioned it: “I promised you a trophy. P2 at our first home race of the season. Grateful to have family and friends here to share the moment. Let’s go again tomorrow.”The achievement was even sweeter as it helped Wehrlein close the gap with championship leader Oliver Rowland to just 50 points.

Finishing second is a good result, but we had a small taste of the victory. I think pace-wise, we were the quickest, so I tried really hard and it was close in the end. I think we can be happy with today, good points for the team, good points for the championship. Every race is all-in and we try to maximise every one. ”His second-place finish also gave a crucial boost to TAG Heuer Porsche in the Teams’ and Manufacturers’ Championship.Following Sunday’s race, where Pascal Wehrlein failed to score and Oliver Rowland picked up 12 points, Wehrlein remains second in the Formula E Drivers’ Standings with 125 points.

He and Sebastien Buemi both have 14 career victories.Reacting to the post, a fan wrote, “14 and counting!

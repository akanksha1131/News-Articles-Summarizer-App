NEW DELHI: At 5am IST on September 22, Zubin Bharucha’s phone buzzed. It was a video call from Vaibhav Suryavanshi in Brisbane after India U19's first youth one-day against Australia U19.""This boy drives me crazy,"" Bharucha, Rajasthan Royals ' Director of High Performance, told TimesofIndia.com. ""I asked him, ‘ Vaibhav , it is pretty early in India, what do you want to show me?’"" Bharucha recalled asking the 14-year-old.The teenager turned the camera towards the ground and asked, ""Sir, ye light dekha apane? (Can you see this light?)""A perplexed Bharucha replied, ""I have never been to Brisbane in my life, Vaibhav.""""After a while, I realised, 'Oh, he's showing me the bloody light over there in Brisbane.' And he's telling me, ‘Sir, look at this light ek, do, teen, chaar khamba hai (There are four pillars).’""A baffled Bharucha asked Vaibhav to cut to the chase. ""Maine bola haan kya karu abhi (I said yes, what can I do?)."" Vaibhav got a bit annoyed and said, ""Nahi sir, main kya samjha raha hoon aapko? Ye chaaron light hai na IPL mey ek khamba mey lagta hai (No sir, what am I even explaining to you? These four are lights, right? In the IPL, they’re installed on a single pole).""Bharucha, still half-asleep, failed to understand Vaibhav's point: ""I still didn't get what he was trying to say.""This got the teenager agitated, and he said: ""Arey sir, ball nahi dikh raha idhar (I can't see the ball while playing).""It left Bharucha smiling, and he replied, ""Vaibhav, sabke liye same hi light hai (Everyone is playing under the same lights).""Bharucha still doesn’t know whether his calming words helped the child prodigy, but if the scorecards are to be believed - they have made their mark and how! Vaibhav has set the Australian shores on fire.After playing brisk cameos in the youth ODIs, he smoked a century in youth Tests. The boy, who made his first-class debut at 12, bagged his million-dollar IPL deal at 13, and then made history as the youngest player to hit a century in men’s T20s off just 35 balls.Earlier this year, he hit the fastest century on record in youth ODIs against England at Worcester. He already has a big fan following. When he traveled to the UK, he was stopped for selfies at the airport, and fans reached the venue to get his autographs.Yes, it is only a youth international, but he is the youngest player in either squads by two-and-a-half years. He has looked at least a level or two above the rest.Amid all the glitz and glamour, Vikram Rathour, former India batting coach, who is currently with Rajasthan Royals, firmly believes that Suryavanshi is destined for big things.""He's got a hundred in England, he's got a hundred in Australia. And you see what he can do in T20 cricket (IPL). Outstanding for a kid so young,"" Rathour told TimesofIndia.com.""He is a prodigy. But the great thing about him is that he's not flustered at all. It's not that he scored his hundred and suddenly becomes a big name in Indian cricket at a young age. Nothing has changed. He's still so grounded and comfortable with all this suddenly happening around him. That's a great thing to have,"" he said.Bharucha echoes Rathour's voice and goes a step further, requesting the selectors to ""blood"" him immediately.""He should be blooded into the senior team immediately, like Sachin was all those years ago,"" said Bharucha.""They have to blood this guy immediately, boss, because he is in another zone only. At least send him on an India A tour. Send him to India A immediately. I'm telling you, this Australian attack that is here, bowling to India A guys, he would have got a double hundred,"" he said.Bharucha narrated a story from the IPL, when the teenager faced Jofra Archer in the nets.""He smoked Jofra Archer in the nets. Jofra Archer, when he bowls in the nets, he's a demon. He never bowls a warm-up ball when the batter is there. He absolutely charges in. And actually, Jofra Archer knocked off Steve Smith's head in a practice session we had before the Ashes. Smith was struggling against him. From that day onwards, he never went inside the net when Jofra was bowling.""When he was bowling to Vaibhav, I was scared, and this boy hit one shot on the back foot, and it went out of the stadium. All the coaching staff, even Jofra, were stunned,"" he said.Bharucha and Rathour agree there are areas in his game that still need improvement. His love for mutton and rice is something that scares Bharucha, but with a bat in hand and his six-hitting prowess, he excites the former Mumbai batter, who feels the boy from Samastipur, Bihar, is a world-class talent—far beyond his years.","Vaibhav Suryavanshi made his first-class debut at 12, bagged his million-dollar IPL deal at 13.

Australian cricket selectors have announced their squads for the upcoming white-ball series against India, with Mitchell Starc making his return to international cricket and uncapped batter Matthew Renshaw earning a recall to the ODI squad. The squads were revealed on Tuesday (October 7) for three ODI matches beginning October 19 and the first two T20 internationals, as Australia continue preparation for next year's T20 World Cup.Starc, who recently retired from T20 internationals, returns to the squad after sitting out the South Africa series in August. He had been resting since the West Indies Test tour with his workload being carefully managed ahead of the Ashes.The 15-man ODI squad sees four new additions alongside Starc, including Renshaw, Matt Short, and Mitch Owen.

Marnus Labuschagne has been left out of the squad after scoring just one run in each of his two innings against South Africa.Mitchell Marsh will continue as ODI captain while Pat Cummins recovers from lumbar bone stress in preparation for the Ashes.

Shubman Gill: Too much too soon for 26-year-old with leadership duties?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/shubman-gill-too-much-too-soon-for-26-year-old-with-leadership-duties/articleshow/124351882.cms,"India's captain Shubman Gill (PTI Photo)

Shubman Gill press conference: Jasprit Bumrah fitness, Kuldeep Yadav selection, team combination and more

MUMBAI: For about half an hour after lunch on Day Three of the first Test between India and the West Indies at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, Skipper Shubman Gill went missing, and Devdutt Padikkal acted as his substitute fielder. Vice-captain and player-of-the-match Ravindra Jadeja marshalled the troops in Gill’s absence.If we connect the dots now to what happened an hour after the game concluded on Saturday, one can guess why Gill went inside the dressing room. He was part of the virtual selection meeting for the tour of Australia, where he was elevated as captain of the ODI team, replacing Rohit Sharma Gill is just 26. He is already the Test captain and the T20I vice-captain to Suryakumar Yadav. He has 16 top brands riding on him and is BCCI ’s poster boy. With a new team sponsor, the BCCI is keen to push someone as the face to sell the sport. So what if the tyre company that sponsors the team and the tyre company that pays Gill to place their sticker on his willow are rival brands? However, it could come with pitfalls in the form of injuries and burnouts. Take a look at the turnaround times between series. India finish their Test engagements vs West Indies in New Delhi on Oct 14, provided the game lasts the distance.The tour to Australia commences Oct 19 in Perth, for which the team has to leave on the 15th.The tour of Australia concludes with the fifth T20I in Brisbane on Nov 8. The first Test vs South Africa commences in Kolkata on Nov 14, and that tour, comprising two Tests, three ODIs, and five T20Is, ends on Dec 19 in Ahmedabad.Gill is expected to play all the fixtures. Between Oct 10 and Dec 19, he is scheduled to fly 19,066.8 air miles, captain and open in ODIs, captain and bat at No. 4 in Tests, and open in T20Is with Abhishek Sharma. He must prove that the call to open with him and demote Sanju Samson is the right one and be a good deputy to SKY.It’s a lot on the young man’s plate. This correspondent asked chief selector Ajit Agarkar whether such a packed schedule risks burnout for such a key performer like Gill. Agarkar, though, was defiant. “Hopefully not. I mean, he’s still quite young. I mean, we saw what he did in England under immense pressure. So, there were really positive signs there. You’ve seen his record in One-day cricket as a batter. We hope there’s no burnout.”Gill’s one-day record is an outstanding one. In 55 ODIs, he has 2,775 runs at an average of 59.04 and a strike rate of 99.56. He has eight centuries and 15 half-centuries. He is on track to becoming an ODI great like the guy who he replaced as captain and the guy who he idolises, Virat Kohli .In a sport where ego and ambitions are involved, when someone is perceived as a blueeyed boy of the establishment and is trusted with so much power, Gill will have to handhold players and play good cop, bad cop with the younger members and negotiate the path he wants to tread while handling Kohli and Rohit.The Test format captaincy was an easier ride as Kohli and Rohit retired, and the team had a Gill-Gambhir stamp. The white-ball set-up under Rohit was carefully built since 2021, and the man who built it will be in the team but not with the C next to his name. How Gill handles that will be interesting.Speaking on his YouTube channel, former India batter Mohammad Kaif questioned the move to appoint Gill and remove Rohit as ODI skipper and alleged that the selectors pressurised him to accept the role. “He’s getting all of it in a hur ry. It could also lead to a loss. When you get so much in such a short time, it could backfire,” Kaif said.Kaif also expressed fears of Gill getting overburdened.“My point is that don’t overburden him. He captains in Tests, bats at No. 4. He was made the vice-captain in the Asia Cup — will take over when Suryakumar Yadav steps aside. Now you’ve made him the ODI captain. I feel everything is being done in a hurry. A player never asks for captaincy. Everyone knows that he didn’t want it. You can’t demand it, but everyone seems to like him a lot and considers him a captain for the future. The selectors, including Ajit Agarkar, have pressurised him. ”","Shubman Gill was part of the virtual selection meeting for the tour of Australia, where he was elevated as captain of the ODI team, replacing Rohit Sharma.

Time India learnt lessons from World para athletics meet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/athletics/time-india-learnt-lessons-from-world-para-athletics-meet/articleshow/124352259.cms,"World Para Athletics Championships 2025 at the Jawaharlal Nehru (JLN) Stadium (PTI Photo)

NEW DELHI: India is celebrating the success of its differently-abled athletes, who achieved a record medal haul at the World Para Athletics Championships, which concluded here on Sunday.The event was probably the largest multi-nation competition hosted by India since the Delhi Commonwealth Games in 2010. Over 2,200 athletes from 104 countries participated, providing the hosts an opportunity to demonstrate their readiness, infrastructure development, organisational capabilities, logistical preparedness and sporting legacy.This event was among several India plans to host as part of its ambitions to host the CWG in 2030 and the Olympics and Paralympics in 2036. The country has been actively lobbying to secure the hosting rights for both multi-disciplinary events. India is engaged in a two-way contest for the CWG with Nigeria, but securing the event is expected to be achievable. The focus of the Indian govt is on the 2036 Olympics, with the Centre and Gujarat’s state machinery making significant efforts to win the rights.Successful hosting of the World para athletics was crucial for the country’s sports administrators.While the nation’s para athletes excelled on the field, securing medal glory and finishing an impressive 10th overall in the tally, organisational capabilities revealed some shortcomings. There were glitches and last-minute efforts to prepare the infrastructure and logistics, with the Jawaharlal Nehru (JLN) stadium’s warm-up track and gymnasium inaugurated on the eve of the championships. A day before the opening ceremony, pieces of broken glass were seen strewn on the newly-laid Mondo track, which hosted the competition rounds. The nine-lane, blue prefabricated synthetic surface at the main ground and the warm-up track inside the JLN premises cost the govt close to Rs 25 crore.Cars with VVIP and VIP stickers, as well as those carrying dignitaries, were seen entering the ‘No Vehicle Zone’ regularly during the championship days, a strictly prohibited area when hosting a para competition, given the safety and well-being of differently-abled athletes.Furthermore, in a big embarrassment, stray dogs bit two foreign coaches inside the stadium when they were training their athletes at the warm-up track. Around the same time, a security guard at one of the stadium’s entrance gates was also attacked. Some ministry and Indian Olympic Association (IOA) officials admitted in private that the dog bite incident had dented the country’s global sporting image, bringing negative publicity. “That too, at a time, when the Commonwealth Sport – CWG’s global governing body – is about to announce its decision on the 2030 host, with India leading the race and the country’s top sports administrators engaged in a ‘Continuous Dialogue’ phase with the IOC which is having a feasibility assessment of the interested party’s preparedness,” said an official.All these incidents can serve as a learning experience for India and its sports administrators, who can take cues to ensure such incidents do not recur during future championships. While several former and current sportspersons have hailed the conduct of the championships, the country’s ambitions to host the CWG or Olympics can only materialise if it works on the gains from the World para athletics and also on its shortcomings.","World Para Athletics Championships concluded here on Sunday.

Poll Do you think the West Indies pace attack needs a major revamp? Yes, they need stronger bowlers No, a few adjustments are enough

Former Indian cricket captain Sunil Gavaskar has criticised the West Indies bowling attack following their innings and 140-run defeat to India in Ahmedabad.The West Indies cricket team struggled in their first innings, scoring only 162 runs, with Indian fast bowlers Mohammed Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah leading the bowling attack.India demonstrated their dominance by declaring at 448/5, before dismissing West Indies for 146 runs in their second innings. The match concluded in just two and a half days.""In Ahmedabad, apart from Jayden Seales, the other two were simply trundlers, who looked more like net bowlers than international ones,"" Gavaskar wrote in his column for Sportstar.""No disrespect intended to them, but to see the first bouncer being bowled after half a dozen overs had been bowled made one ask, 'Is this really the West Indies pace attack?' Yes, bowling bouncers is a big effort, and on a hot day, it can take a lot out of a bowler, but it is a surprise weapon to stop the batter from moving on to the front foot regularly.""The second Test match between India and West Indies is scheduled to take place in New Delhi from October 10-14.Gavaskar expressed concern about the decline in West Indies batting quality, noting that cricket's uneven wealth distribution may be a contributing factor.""For a team that once boasted of the likes of the Three Ws, Rohan Kanhai, Seymour Nurse, Clive Lloyd, Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes, to name just a few, there is simply nobody in this current team who looks like getting a million country miles close to them,"" he added.""Of course, I haven't forgotten the incomparable Garfield Sobers, Viv Richards and the 'Prince of Trinidad', Brian Lara.

The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) has confirmed that the third umpire's decision to declare Pakistan 's Muneeba Ali run out during their 88-run defeat to India in the Women's World Cup was correct and followed the Laws of Cricket.During Pakistan's chase of 248, Muneeba faced a delivery from Kranti Gaud in the fourth over's final ball that led to an lbw appeal.While she was out of her crease, Deepti Sharma's throw hit the stumps. Although Muneeba had initially grounded her bat, it was in the air when the ball struck the stumps, resulting in her dismissal for two runs after a review by third umpire Kerrin Klaaste.The decision sparked a debate, with Pakistan's captain Fatima Sana Khan contesting that Muneeba had no intention to run and had already grounded her bat.The MCC, as the guardian of cricket's laws, released a statement confirming the dismissal's validity.""A batter shall not be considered to be out of his/her ground if, in running or diving towards his/her ground and beyond, and having grounded some part of his/her person or bat beyond the popping crease, there is subsequent loss of contact.""""This Law means that if you are running or diving towards the end that the stumps are broken, and you ground your bat or person behind the line, you are not out if you then lose contact with the ground and the wicket is subsequently broken. Muneeba had grounded her bat beyond the popping crease after being hit on the pads, and her bat subsequently lifted. Isn't this exactly what the Law covers?""""The answer to that is no – the Law specifically only covers a player who is running or diving - and Muneeba was not moving towards her ground.She had taken guard from beyond the popping crease and at no time did her feet move back into her ground.""""This Law, which was introduced in 2010 and is sometimes referred to as the 'bouncing bat Law', is to protect a batter who inadvertently loses contact with the ground as they move towards the stumps, either with their bat bouncing up or just with both their feet being airborne through the natural process of running.""""It does not protect a batter who is turning for another run, overbalancing, or who – as in Muneeba's case – simply lifts their bat into the air. The third umpire was entirely correct to give this Out.""The MCC provided additional clarification about the type of dismissal.""It's a Run out – although she was not attempting a run, and it was not a No ball, the wicket was not broken by the wicket-keeper without the intervention of another fielder – it was instead a fielder who threw it. So the decision, correctly given by the umpires, is Out, Run out.""India posted a score of 247 and dismissed Pakistan for 159 in 43 overs to secure a convincing victory.","Muneeba Ali was run out by third umpire Kerrin Klaaste during Pakistan's 88-run defeat to India in the Women's World Cup.

Rohit Sharma removed as India ODI captain, a glorious era comes to an end

Former Indian cricketer Robin Uthappa has endorsed BCCI 's decision to name Shubman Gill as ODI captain for India's upcoming Australia tour. The decision comes as current captain Rohit Sharma , at 36 years old, would be 41 by the 2027 World Cup.The BCCI revealed the ODI and T20I teams for the Australian series starting October 19. The series includes three ODIs and five T20Is.Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are set to return to cricket following their last appearance in the Champions Trophy 2025 final. Shubman Gill will lead the ODI team with Shreyas Iyer serving as vice-captain, while Rohit will not captain the side.""He's gonna be, in all honesty, 41 when that World Cup comes around. Right? So, you gotta keep that in consideration as well. And for all intents and purposes, I think it's done with taking the decision when the stakes are low rather than when the stakes are high, you don't want another situation like what happened in Australia,"" Uthappa said on his YouTube channel.Chief Selector Ajit Agarkar personally informed Rohit about the management's decision to transition the captaincy. The change was implemented two years before the 2027 World Cup to allow Gill time to adapt to his new role.Gill, now appointed as ODI captain, focuses on the World Cup. India are scheduled to play approximately 20 ODIs before the tournament in South Africa, where Gill aims to secure the trophy.Uthappa expressed confidence in Rohit's abilities and hopes for his continued fitness to avoid uncomfortable situations.""To happen to Rohit Sharma, he's too good a player for something to happen to him like that again. So, maybe to avoid all those stuffs. Maybe, I don't know… You don't want an uncomfortable situation like that, and if he keeps himself fit, then no questions there. You know Rohit and Virat will be a part of that side,"" he added.""I don't see form kind of dipping that sense, but it's just about reflexes and does that work, and how those things work because right now, they are not playing a lot of cricket as well. The only cricket they'll find themselves playing is perhaps the IPL and One Day cricket, and perhaps maybe some domestic One Day matches if they do come by.""Rohit's ODI captaincy record since 2017 includes 56 matches with 42 wins, 12 losses, one no-result, and one tie. His 75 percent win rate ranks him among the world's top white-ball captains.Under Rohit's leadership, India claimed the 2018 and 2023 ODI Asia Cup titles, finished runners-up in the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup at home, and won the ICC Champions Trophy in Dubai.Rohit's first major achievement as ODI captain came in 2018 with the Asia Cup victory. He contributed 317 runs in five innings, including one century and two fifties, averaging 105.66.His full-time ODI captaincy began in early 2022 after Virat Kohli stepped down. From February 2022, India won 34 out of 46 matches under Rohit, with 10 losses, one no-result, and one tie.During his captaincy period from 2022, Rohit scored 1,963 runs in 45 matches at an average of 47.87 and a strike rate of 116.84.

Poll Do you believe that cricket should be separated from political tensions? Absolutely Not really

Former England captain Michael Atherton has called on the International Cricket Council (ICC) to increase transparency in its tournament draw system, suggesting a reduction in India-Pakistan matches. His comments follow the controversies during the 2025 Asia Cup The recent men's Asian tournament was marked by political undertones, influenced by the terror attack and border conflicts between the two nations. Both the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) were involved in these disputes.India and Pakistan have consistently been placed in the same group at ICC events for many years. The ICC's group selection process remains largely unexplained, unlike other major sporting tournaments.The cricket governing body reportedly ensures these teams share the same group to guarantee at least one India-Pakistan match per tournament. The Asia Cup takes this further, with its format designed to potentially create three such matches within a month, as seen in the latest edition.The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) relies heavily on the revenue from these matches to support grassroots cricket development in the region, making it a complex issue to address.""Despite its scarcity (maybe, in part, because of its scarcity) it is a fixture that carries huge economic clout, one of the main reasons why the broadcast rights for ICC tournaments are worth so much — roughly $3 billion for the most recent rights cycle (in) 2023-27,"" Atherton wrote in his column for The Times. ""Due to the relative decline in the value of bilateral matches, ICC events have grown in frequency and importance, and so the India and Pakistan fixture is crucial to the balance sheets of those who would not otherwise have any skin in the game. """"If cricket was once the vehicle for diplomacy, it is now, clearly, a proxy for broader tensions and for propaganda. There is little justification, in any case, for a serious sport to arrange tournament fixtures to suit its economic needs and now that the rivalry is being exploited in other ways, there is even less justification for it. For the next broadcast rights cycle, the fixture draw before ICC events should be transparent and if the two teams do not meet every time, so be it,"" Atherton added.These matches between India and Pakistan generate significant economic value, particularly for ICC tournaments. The broadcasting rights for these events command substantial fees, with the current cycle (2023-27) valued at approximately $3 billion.Recent events at the Asia Cup have highlighted the increasing intersection of cricket and geopolitics between these nations. The tournament saw multiple controversies and political statements from both sides.","Former England captain Michael Atherton has called on the International Cricket Council to increase transparency in its tournament draw system.

India captain Harmanpreet Kaur remained calm under pressure after a fiery moment with Pakistan’s Nashra Sandhu during the ICC Women’s World Cup clash at R. Premadasa Stadium on Sunday.Batting at No. 4, Harmanpreet scored 19 runs off 34 balls, including two boundaries, and shared a 39-run partnership for the third wicket with Harleen Deol. The tense exchange occurred in the 22nd over of India’s innings.One delivery earlier, Kaur had sent Sandhu down for a boundary.

Although she did mutter some words under her breath, it is unclear what was spoken.India’s innings struggled for momentum overall, with openers Smriti Mandhana (23) and Pratika Rawal (31) putting on 48 for the first wicket. After Kaur’s dismissal, Harleen Deol (46) and Jemimah Rodrigues (32) added 45 runs for the fourth wicket, helping India reach a competitive total of 247 in 50 overs.All-rounders Deepti Sharma (25) and Sneh Rana (20) contributed a 42-run stand for the sixth wicket, while Richa Ghosh’s quickfire 35 off 20 balls provided a late boost to the innings.In response, Pakistan struggled to chase the target, eventually being bowled out for 159 in 43 overs, handing India an 88-run victory. Sandhu, who had tried to intimidate Kaur, finished with just one wicket in her spell and conceded 52 runs in 10 overs.The match highlighted India’s dominance in a tense contest while also showcasing Kaur’s leadership and composure under pressure.India’s bowlers ensured that the visitors never got close to the target, with disciplined spells throughout the innings keeping Pakistan’s scoring in check.","Harmanpreet Kaur remained unfazed as Pakistan's Nashra Sandhu gave her a 'death stare' during the ICC Women's World Cup clash on Sunday.

In an emotional 13-minute video on his YouTube channel, former India cricketer Mohammed Kaif questioned the decision to remove Rohit Sharma from ODIs and blamed chief selector Ajit Agarkar for pressurizing Shubman Gill to take over the captaincy.""What wrong has Rohit Sharma done? It's very unfortunate that we didn’t get a long captaincy run from Rohit—not even four years,"" Kaif said.""A great batter, an outstanding leader, and as captain, he could have had an even more impressive record. When you snatch captaincy, I feel a player loses his right hand,"" he added.Kaif said the selectors should have waited until the 2027 ODI World Cup for the change of guard.""This was on expected lines, but I felt this would happen after the 2027 World Cup. The guy has quality, and he's also worked on his fitness.

He's getting all of it in a hurry. It could also backfire. When you get so much responsibility in such a short time, it could affect performance,"" he said.""My point is: don’t overburden him. He captains in Tests, bats at No. 4, was made vice-captain in the Asia Cup , and will take over when Suryakumar Yadav steps aside.""Now you've made him the ODI captain. I feel everything is being done in a hurry. A player never asks for captaincy.""Everyone knows he didn't want it.

Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan made an eye-catching post on his social media to celebrate India's victory over arch-rivals Pakistan in the Women's ODI World Cup on Sunday.“Just another Sunday of Eat. Sleep. Win. Repeat. Team India ,” wrote Pathan on X, capturing the mood of Indian fans after yet another convincing win over their noisy neighbours.For the fourth consecutive Sunday, India emerged victorious against their arch-rivals, three times in the Asia Cup (including a final) and now in the Women’s World Cup, continuing their dominance in cricket’s most emotionally charged rivalry.At Colombo’s R. Premadasa Stadium, India’s women secured a commanding 88-run win, but the match was overshadowed by tension that simmered both on and off the field.The traditional post-match handshake was notably absent, as players from both sides walked straight to their dressing rooms after the final ball.Even before play began, captains Harmanpreet Kaur and Fatima Sana skipped the customary handshake at the toss, a sign of the frosty relations between the two camps.Controversy erupted right from the toss when Sana’s call of “tails” was misheard as “heads,” mistakenly awarding Pakistan the toss.The confusion was only the start of a drama-filled day. Soon after, Pakistan opener Muneeba Ali was bizarrely run out after stepping out of her crease following an LBW review — her bat airborne when the bails were removed, leading to heated protests.Despite the tension, India stayed composed. Harleen Deol anchored the innings with a steady 46, while Richa Ghosh provided late fireworks, smashing 35 off 20 balls to lift India to 247. Pakistan’s Diana Baig bowled valiantly for her 4/69, but it wasn’t enough.In reply, Pakistan faltered early and never recovered. India’s spinners — Deepti Sharma and Sneh Rana — shared five wickets, and Kranti Goud’s fiery three-wicket burst sealed the deal.Only Sidra Amin’s graceful 81 offered resistance, but she lacked support as Pakistan crumbled.With this win, India climbed to the top of the table, while Pakistan remain winless — another Sunday, another Indian celebration.","India beat Pakistan by 88 runs in the Women's ODI World Cup in Sri Lanka.

Pakistan's fast bowler Diana Baig has confirmed that the confusion surrounding Muneeba Ali 's controversial run-out against India in Colombo has been resolved.The Women's World Cup match between India and Pakistan on Sunday was marked by controversy. The unusual incident occurred during Pakistan's chase of 248 runs.In the fourth over's final delivery, Indian players appealed for an lbw against Muneeba off Kranti Gaud's bowling, which the on-field umpire denied.Muneeba had secured her position by grounding her bat behind the crease. Deepti Sharma then threw the ball from slip, hitting the stumps. At that moment, Muneeba lifted her bat without any part of her body behind the crease.The third umpire's conflicting decisions displayed on the big screen created confusion among players and spectators. The initial verdict was not out, causing Indian players to return to their positions. The decision was then changed to out, surprising Muneeba and triggering celebrations among Indian players.""Muneeba's run-out issue has already been settled, I believe. I don't want to talk much about it now. Whatever happened and whatever the situation was, I think it has been resolved,"" Diana stated after Pakistan's 88-run loss.After being given out for 2 runs off 12 balls, Muneeba sought clarification from the on-field umpires. She paused while walking back after receiving instructions from the team dugout.Muneeba remained on the field while Pakistan captain Fatima Sana discussed the situation with fourth umpire Kim Cotton. The captain then signaled Muneeba to leave, ending the several-minute delay.The ICC Playing Condition 30.1.2 states: ""However, a batter shall not be considered to be out of his ground if, in running or diving towards his ground and beyond, and having grounded some part of his person or bat beyond the popping crease, there is subsequent loss of contact between the ground and any part of his person or bat, or between the bat and person.""This incident caused significant discussion during the match between the rival teams. The controversy added another chapter to the intense cricket rivalry between India and Pakistan.Muneeba's dismissal proved to be a crucial moment in the match. Pakistan struggled to recover from this early setback in their pursuit of India's target.The match ultimately ended in India's favor with a significant margin of victory.

Currently, they only participate in bilateral ODIs, which have seen a reduction in frequency due to commercial factors, along with the IPL T20 tournament.""Rohit and Virat want to play the 2027 World Cup, but game fitness will be a big challenge for them. Rohit has worked well on his fitness. He is focused on that. But there is regular fitness, and game time fitness… If you are not playing regular cricket, both of them have to ensure some game time. They have to play domestic cricket,"" Pathan said on his YouTube channel.""They are big players and know what to do. They have all the experience in the world. But they are not even playing T20Is, so there will be big gaps between the few matches that they play before the big World Cup. They will need regular game time to be fit for that. Only then will their dream to play the 2027 World Cup come true.""The upcoming ODI tour of Australia will mark the beginning of Gill's captaincy.Following this, India's domestic season will commence in winter, featuring the Vijay Hazare Trophy, the country's premier List-A tournament. Neither Kohli nor Rohit has participated in this domestic competition for several years.""There is a leadership change; Gill will lead in both formats now. This is a big opportunity but a huge responsibility too. He has to take forward Virat's legacy in Test cricket and Rohit's legacy in white-ball cricket. This is a challenging but exciting phase for him as he is already batting well, he will need to keep that form going,"" he added.Shubman Gill's promotion comes at a significant time as he takes over the leadership role from one of India's most successful white-ball captains.

Opening their 2025 ICC Women’s ODI World Cup campaign with a crushing 10-wicket victory over South Africa in Guwahati on Friday, England will look to turn Barsapara Cricket Stadium into a happy hunting ground when they face Bangladesh in their second group league match at the same venue on Tuesday.Bowling first, it was a superb spin display by the English women, led by left-arm spinner Lisney Smith, that helped them skittle the Proteas for a paltry 69 before reaching the target in the 15th over. Staying back at the venue since then, the traditional powerhouse of women’s cricket already has a good understanding of the conditions. Against Bangladesh, they will aim to exploit this familiarity with the Barsapara track to register back-to-back wins.Bangladesh, on the other hand, will look to build on the confidence gained from beating Pakistan by seven wickets in their opening game in Colombo on Thursday. They also had a powerful all-round bowling display to dismantle the Pakistan batters for a below-par 129 before reaching the target in the 32nd over.Tuesday will be a different ball game against the four-time ODI world champions, who boast globally known stars like Nat Sciver-Brunt, Sophie Ecclestone, Heather Knight, Lauren Bell, Tammy Beaumont , and many others. On experience and paper, the Europeans are far ahead of their Asian opponents, but Bangladesh will try to prove their performance against Pakistan was no fluke.Bangladesh will rely on players like wicketkeeper-captain Nigar Sultana , seamer Marufa Akter, spinner Nishita Akter Nishi, and opener Rubya Haider to take the battle to their opponents. While Marufa was adjudged player of the match against Pakistan with figures of 2/31 from her seven overs, Haider was instrumental in the chase with a solid and unbeaten 54.The Barsapara pitch is likely to aid the batters as always, with pacers getting some early help. As the game progresses, the surface may slow down a bit, bringing spinners into play.With a forecast of slight afternoon rain, England will start as firm favourites on Tuesday.

After asking how he was doing and whether he was maintaining his fitness, the coach playfully added, “Wo toh dekhne mein pata chalega. Aaja tu"" (We’ll only get to know when I see you. You return first).The young batter simply smiled and replied with a quiet “yes,” acknowledging his coach's playful warning to stay fit and be ready for his fitness 'test' once he's back from international duty. He then greeted another member of the Royals’ coaching staff before ending the call.Suryavanshi has been in exceptional form during the ongoing youth tour. In the first Youth Test against Australia U19, he scored a blistering 113 off just 86 balls, bringing up his century in only 78 deliveries.His innings included nine fours and eight sixes, and he shared a crucial 152-run stand with Vedant Trivedi.India posted 428 in their first innings before bowling out the hosts cheaply, sealing a massive win by an innings and 58 runs. Australia will look to bounce back in the decider at Mackay, while India will aim to continue their dominance.Suryavanshi’s rise has been nothing short of remarkable. He made his Ranji Trophy debut for Uttar Pradesh at just 12 years and 284 days — the youngest player in the tournament’s history. His breakthrough continued when Rajasthan Royals picked him up in the IPL 2025 auction at the age of 13.He made headlines in the IPL with a breathtaking 38-ball 101, which is the second-fastest century in IPL history, behind only Chris Gayle’s iconic 30-ball ton in 2013, and the fastest ever by an Indian.",14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi got on a video call with Rajasthan Royals batting coach Vikram Rathour.

Poll Do you believe Dhruv Jurel has secured his place in the Test squad? Yes, he's proved his worth No, he still needs to perform consistently

Dhruv Jurel’s introduction to Test cricket in 2024 was a classic case of opportunity meeting preparation. Initially the backup wicketkeeper, his chance arrived during the home series against England when the selectors, frustrated with KS Bharat's underwhelming returns with the bat, handed Jurel his debut.The 24-year-old, who everyone took notice of after his debut knock of 32 off 15 balls as an Impact-sub for Rajasthan Royals in 2023, stepped up, impressing immediately with his tidy work behind the stumps and useful contributions with the bat in the three Tests at Rajkot, Ranchi and Dharamsala.His journey since has been defined by filling whatever role the team required. Later that year in Australia, he was drafted into the playing XI for the Perth Test as a pure batter following an injury to Shubman Gill.Though he was later sidelined, Rishabh Pant ’s subsequent injuries in England thrust Jurel back into the spotlight as a substitute keeper for the critical Tests at Lord's and The Oval, where he again proved his reliability.Now, with Pant still on the road to recovery, Jurel has been entrusted with the keeping duties for the home series against the West Indies. And in Ahmedabad, he has authored his most compelling argument yet.His maiden Test century on Day Two of the first Test, which India won convincingly by an innings and 140 runs, was more than a personal milestone; it was a powerful, narrative-shifting innings.Until now, Jurel has been a stand-in, a capable deputy covering for absent colleagues. The 125-run knock, however, has changed the conversation.The undeniable truth is that Rishabh Pant, a proven match-winner, will reclaim his spot once fully fit. But Jurel, through this innings and his consistent performances for India A and in the domestic circuit, has made the selectors' task incredibly difficult.Jurel has also earned a call-up in the ODI squad for the upcoming away ODI series against Australia.The pressing question is no longer about his capability as a backup keeper, but whether the team can afford to leave a batter of his capability out of the side entirely.Former India batting coach Vikram Rathour , who has worked with Jurel in the Indian side and Royals set-up since last year, feels the youngster from Agra continues to bat the way he has been batting, he can push for a place purely as a batter.“At this stage of his career, this hundred is extremely important for Jurel. He is fortunate to get this opportunity with Rishabh Pant injured. But by scoring runs like this, he is consolidating his place in the team. When Pant returns, he will naturally comeback as a wicketkeeper-batter, but if Jurel continues to bat the way he has been batting lately, he can push for a place purely as a batter in the team. He certainly has the technique, the skill and temperament to play for India as a specialist batter. By scoring hundred he has grabbed that opportunity with both his hands,” Rathour told TOI.The ex-India batting coach pointed out Jurel's ‘right mindset’.“In Test cricket, Jurel has shown the temperament and technique you need at this level. He plays very correct cricket which is such an asset in the longer format. I had the opportunity to work with him during his debut series against England and he played a couple of vital knocks for us, especially in the match in Ranchi. It showed his ability to absorb pressure, his patience, his clarity in shot selection. Those are the qualities you look for in a Test player and Jurel certainly has them,” he added.",Dhruv Jurel smashed 125 from 210 balls in India's first innings against West Indies in Ahmedabad.

Run out or stumped? The laws behind Muneeba Ali’s controversial dismissal - Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-womens-world-cup-2025/run-out-or-stumped-the-laws-behind-muneeba-alis-controversial-dismissal-explained/articleshow/124342139.cms,"Muneeba Ali of Pakistan (Photo by Sameera Peiris/Getty Images)

Not a Rivalry Anymore? India Destroys Pakistan in Colombo | Women’s WC

During Sunday’s ICC Women’s World Cup clash between India and Pakistan , a moment of confusion arose over the dismissal of Pakistan batter Muneeba Ali. The incident occurred in the fourth over of Pakistan’s innings.Muneeba had survived an appeal for LBW, but immediately afterwards, the ball deflected to Deepti Sharma at slip. Observing that Muneeba was outside her crease, Deepti threw down the stumps. After a lengthy review, Muneeba was adjudged out because her bat was not grounded behind the popping crease at the moment the bails were removed.To understand the decision, it is important to consider several Laws of cricket. The first point is that the ball was still live despite the earlier LBW appeal. Just because a player or umpire appeals for LBW, it does not mean the ball becomes dead.In this case, the appeal was answered Not Out, the ball had not yet settled in the hands of the wicket-keeper, and Deepti’s actions demonstrated that the play was still active.The key question then was whether Muneeba was in her ground when the stumps were broken. Evidence clearly showed that her bat was airborne at the moment the bails were removed.Some observers wondered whether Law 30.1.2, introduced in 2010 and often called the ‘bouncing bat Law,’ might apply.This Law states that a batter shall not be considered out of their ground if, while running or diving towards the crease, their bat or body temporarily loses contact with the ground after having grounded it behind the popping crease.However, this protection only applies to batters who are actively moving toward their ground. In Muneeba’s case, she was stationary, having taken her guard beyond the popping crease. Her feet did not move back into the crease, and the bat was lifted into the air without any attempt to run.The Law is designed to protect batters who unintentionally lose contact with the ground while running or diving, not those who simply lift their bat or overbalance while stationary. By this reasoning, the third umpire was correct in giving her out.There was also a question about the mode of dismissal. Since Muneeba was not attempting a run, should she have been stumped instead of run out? The correct ruling is Run out. This is because she was not taking a run, and the stumps were broken by a fielder, not the wicket-keeper acting alone. The ball was live, there was no no-ball, and the action involved the fielder throwing down the stumps. Under these conditions, the umpires’ decision of Run out was entirely correct.","Muneeba Ali was dismissed by Deepti Sharma in the fourth over of Pakistan’s innings.

MADRID: Midfielder Rodri has been dropped from Spain's squad for upcoming World Cup qualifying games because of an injury sustained when playing for Manchester City in the Premier League this weekend.Spain said Monday that Rodri will not play against Georgia and Bulgaria during the international break. The Spanish soccer federation said it made the decision after receiving the results of medical tests conducted by Man City.Spain is already missing young Barcelona forward Lamine Yamal because of a groin ailment.Rodri was forced off with a suspected hamstring problem in the first half of Man City's 1-0 win at Brentford on Sunday, the latest injury blow to hit last year's Ballon d'Or winner.Rodri said after the game he ""felt a little bit in the hamstring but it seems like it's not that much.""""I stretched the leg a little bit, a bit like in the Euros final. I stretched a little bit but it's part of the process,"" he said. ""I don't feel that I feel tired muscle-wise, I feel fresh but the most important thing is it's not that big.""Rodri said ""the good thing is the break so it will be even better in this sense to recover these days and hopefully I can be in the next game.""Rodri looked forlorn as he walked gingerly off the field in the 21st minute, moments after slumping to the ground while clutching the back of his right leg. He was replaced by Nico Gonzalez.Rodri sustained ACL damage in September last year that kept him out for eight months. He missed the start of this season after picking up another injury, reportedly to his groin, at the Club World Cup and has complained of knee pain in recent weeks.","Rodri was forced off with a suspected hamstring problem in the first half of Man City's 1-0 win at Brentford on Sunday.

MADRID: Vinicius Junior fired Real Madrid to the top of La Liga with a brace in a 3-1 win over Villarreal on Saturday, while Kylian Mbappe was also on target.Los Blancos moved two points clear of champions Barcelona, who visit Sevilla on Sunday, as they bounced back from last week's derby drubbing.Having returned from their long midweek trip to Kazakhstan, where they beat Kairat in the Champions League , Madrid turned their focus back to domestic matters.Thrashed 5-2 by city rivals Atletico Madrid last weekend, Xabi Alonso's side had plenty to prove against a strong Villarreal team, who are third.""I played very well and I want to continue like this, keeping this confidence and doing even more,"" Vinicius told Real Madrid TV.""We have good feelings... when we come back (from the international break) we have big games and we need confidence,"" added Vinicius.The winger did not start the season well but has found form in recent outings.""Vini had a very good game and he was decisive, I'm very happy for him,"" Alonso told reporters.Alonso brought Fede Valverde back into the team, playing him at right-back in the absence of injured duo Dani Carvajal and Trent Alexander-Arnold.Madrid had the better of a slow-paced first half at the Santiago Bernabeu.Teenage attacker Franco Mastantuono might have sent Los Blancos ahead but Villarreal defender Renato Veiga blocked his shot after Mbappe cut the ball back to him.At the other end, Thibaut Courtois saved superbly from Tani Oluwaseyi, who snuck in behind the centre-backs but could not beat Madrid's Belgian goalkeeper.Los Blancos took the lead early in the second half through Vinicius, whose shot took a fortunate deflection off Santi Comesana and flew past the helpless Arnau Tenas.Xabi Alonso brought on Jude Bellingham for the final 25 minutes, after benching him for the second game running following the Atletico debacle.Thomas Tuchel left the midfielder out of his England squad for upcoming World Cup qualifiers this week, and he was out to prove a point.Madrid doubled their lead when Rafa Marin brought down Vinicius in the area and the Brazilian beat Tenas from the spot. The former Barcelona goalkeeper could have stopped the penalty but the ball slipped under him.Alonso said that Mbappe is Madrid's main penalty taker but ""it was their decision"" to give Vinicius the ball.Vinicius wanted another penalty when Tenas appeared to bring him down in the box moments later, but his appeals were waved away.Bellingham twice came close but Tenas denied him on both occasions, with the midfielder kicking a post in frustration.Villarreal pulled a goal back through Georges Mikautadze, who finished lethally from the edge of the box, but Madrid quickly restored their two-goal cushion.Yellow Submarine defender Santiago Mourino was sent off for a second yellow card for a push on Vinicius as he charged down the wing, and soon Mbappe netted the third.Brahim Diaz teed up the French superstar to roll home his ninth league goal of the campaign, making him the division's top scorer.Mbappe was taken off grimacing in the final stages, in the only negative note for a Madrid side who were good value for their three points.""Kylian already had a little discomfort in his ankle, we will see how it goes,"" said Alonso, adding that the forward would still travel to join up with the French national team.Villarreal's Comesana complained about some of the refereeing decisions that went against his side.""It's a shame about the first goal which hit me, and then came the penalty, which wasn't enough (of a foul) to give it,"" Comesana told DAZN.""That hurt us a lot, you only have to look how he threw himself down... and the red card (was soft)... if it's already hard to win at the Bernabeu, with these things it's even harder.""","Real Madrid beat Villarreal 3-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu.

Poll Was Manchester United's win over Sunderland a turning point for their season? Yes, they'll improve No, still skeptical

Arsenal moved to the top of the Premier League table as Declan Rice came back to haunt his former club West Ham, while Manchester United gave manager Ruben Amorim some breathing space with a convincing 2-0 victory over Sunderland on Saturday.In Mikel Arteta ’s 300th match in charge, the Gunners proved too strong for West Ham at the Emirates Stadium, securing a 2-0 win that strengthened their bid for a first Premier League title in 22 years. Victory, however, came at a cost as captain Martin Odegaard was forced off injured before half-time for the third time this season. Arsenal’s squad depth, though, made light of the setback.“We dominated and fully deserved to win this,” Arteta said. “To go top of the table after some big fixtures over the last week and some injuries… we were able to respond.”Rice, who left West Ham in 2023 for a club-record £105 million ($141 million), ended the visitors’ resistance by blasting home on the rebound after Alphonse Areola parried Eberechi Eze’s shot. Bukayo Saka made the points safe from the penalty spot midway through the second half, marking his 200th Arsenal appearance after Jurrien Timber was brought down by El Hadji Malick Diouf.Arsenal now sit a point clear of Liverpool, who face Chelsea later. West Ham remain in the relegation zone.Meanwhile, Ruben Amorim breathed a sigh of relief as Manchester United eased pressure with a 2-0 win over Sunderland at Old Trafford. Mason Mount opened the scoring after eight minutes from Bryan Mbeumo’s cross, while Benjamin Sesko doubled the lead with a predatory finish from a long throw-in. Debutant goalkeeper Senne Lammens kept a clean sheet, and VAR overturned a late Sunderland penalty after insufficient contact by Sesko.Amorim said, “We were a competitive and adult team today. We need to do this kind of performance away as well — it’s our responsibility to play like this.”Tottenham also impressed with a 2-1 win over Leeds, ending their year-long unbeaten league run. Mohammed Kudus scored his first goal for Spurs after Mathys Tel had put the visitors ahead, with Noah Okafor briefly equalising.Liverpool can reclaim the top spot if they beat Chelsea later.",Arsenal beat West Ham 2-0 in Mikel Arteta's 300th match in charge.

Poll Do you agree with Tuchel's decision to leave Bellingham out of the squad for upcoming matches? Yes, it’s the right choice. No, he should be included.

England manager Thomas Tuchel has explained that Jude Bellingham’s absence from the squad for upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia is due to the midfielder’s “lack of rhythm” and not any personal issues.Bellingham, 22, missed England’s September victories over Andorra and Serbia following shoulder surgery and has since featured in only four matches for Real Madrid, starting just once.“He’s a very special player and for special players there can be special rules, I get this,” Tuchel said, referring to Bellingham, who was named England men’s player of the year for 2024/25 at the start of the month. “But for this camp we decided that we stick with our straightforward decision to invite the same team. That applies also for Jude, he deserves always to be in camp.”Tuchel added that Bellingham had been eager to play. “He wanted to be called up, we had a phone call, there was no issue from that side,” he said.The manager also addressed concerns about any friction with other notable absentees, Jack Grealish and Phil Foden, stressing: “No, there is also no problem between me and Phil Foden, there is also no problem with Jack Grealish.Very special players. There is no problem at all, there is no personal problem.”Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka returns to the squad after missing September’s internationals with a hamstring issue, while Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, and Tino Livramento are ruled out through injury.England currently sit atop their World Cup qualifying group, having beaten Andorra 2-0 and Serbia 5-0 last month to record five wins from five matches. Tuchel emphasised the decision to maintain continuity in the squad, saying, “We decided to invite the same group of players to make more stable what we built on.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland.

He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

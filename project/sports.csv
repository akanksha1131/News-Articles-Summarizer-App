SA20 showcasing perfect balance between bat and ball: Vernon Philander

There is something about Sunrisers Eastern Cape and the SA20 playoffs . In 2023, they won the semi-final and the final. In 2024, they won Qualifier 1 and the final. Now, this year, they won the Eliminator, the Qualifier 2 and have booked a spot in the final. That is an unbelievable 6-0 record in the playoffs.Their latest conquest, in the second qualifier, came against Paarl Royals by eight wickets on Thursday at Centurion in Johannesburg. In the final awaits MI Cape Town , at the Wanderers, on Saturday.At the other end of this superlative record sit the Paarl Royals. For the third straight season, they've found themselves in the playoffs and for the third straight season they've not reached the finals.After braving the severe sun and baking heat in Centurion, SEC chased down the 176-run target with quite some ease. Skipper Aiden Markram celebrated the moment, achieved with a cracking cover drive, with a jump and an air punch but the job was done before he arrived. Tony de Zorzi (78 from 49 balls) and Jordan Hermann (69* from 48 balls) put the game well and truly past the Royals' reach of defending. As they put together 111 runs - the highest second-wicket stand for the franchise in SA20 history - all Markram had to do upon arrival was stay steady at the other end.De Zorzi slammed 11 fours and two sixes, earning himself a roaring reception as he walked back to the pavilion and raised his bat. Fittingly, the locals applauded the 27-year-old who came through the U-17 and U-19 ranks at Gauteng, the province under which Johannesburg resides.Even as his opening partner David Bedingham perished and Hermann started slowly, De Zorzi went about his business with aplomb. Soon enough, just when the required rate started to near 10 an over, Hermann joined in the act with four fours and four sixes of his own.In the first innings, Paarl Royals started poorly with Mitchell Owen once again unable to fill in for the giant Joe Root absence. He tried to attack Marco Jasen early, only to get an edge which was held comfortably behind the stumps.Lhuan dre-Pretroius (59 from 41) and Rubin Hermann (81 from 53) put together 99 runs for the second wicket. Andile Phehlukwayo (22 from 11) provided a late flourish but it wasn't enough for the Royals on the night - and for a third straight SA20 season.","Sunrisers Eastern Cape beat Paarl Royals by eight wickets in the SA20 playoffs.

SA20: Markram leads Sunrisers to victory as title defense stays alive

St George's Park Band keeps the spirit high in SA20

JOHANNESBURG: When Paarl Royals took on Sunrisers Eastern Cape at the Centurion in the SA20 on Thursday, it was a momentous occasion for the league. In its third edition now, with just one game to go, SA20 has done what South African cricket desperately wanted - sustenance. The T20 Global League and Mzansi Super League tried, and failed. SA20, with its six franchises, backed by Indian Premier League (IPL) team owners, has grown leaps and bounds.spoke to SA20 league commissioner and former Proteas skipper Graeme Smith on what he described as an ""emotional time.""""It's actually quite an emotional time. I can't believe we have our 100th game. If I think about all the work that went in the beginning to get up and running, and to attract six franchises, then to take it so quickly into Season 1, and we are sitting at the back end of Season 3,"" said Smith.""There's so many highlights for me: from hundreds to fivers to underdogs winning in the first two years. But the thing that stands out for me is the outstanding cricket. We've seen some of the world's best players, both in South Africa and internationally, playing in our country, which has been terrific. And then also the fans. Bringing fans in India is not an issue, but in South Africa, seeing our fans come back to the game and loving it so much has been exciting,"" he went on to elaborate.For SA20, the first step was getting a local broadcaster and they did so in the form of SuperSport - the largest in the country. Global broadcasters, such as Disney+ Hotstar and Jio in India, have also kept their faith in the South African T20 league's brand.The time slot, for the evening game, is 5:30pm local time (9pm IST). This year, the league has an Indian influence on the pitch - in the form of Dinesh Karthik with the Paarl Royals - and in the commentary box with Robin Uthappa.Smith denied that the SA20 has an over-reliance on India and its market.""The Indian market is the biggest cricket market in the world. It's silly. But, I wouldn't say (that) every decision we make is for the Indian market, because we've got full stadiums, we've got to attract eyeballs in South Africa. You want to attract commercial partners in the place that your league is happening as well.""But, you know, we've got global ambitions. And if you've got global ambitions, you want to grow around the world, and India is one of the key markets. We're very fortunate with the six IPL franchises. We're very fortunate with our relationship with Jio and Viacom and all the other partners that we've been able to attract. So I think South African cricket, since readmission back into sport, has always had a very special relationship with Indian fans, and they love South African cricketers. And we want to keep that,"" added Smith who played three seasons with Rajasthan Royals and one with the now defunct Pune Warriors India in the IPL.Another challenge for T20 leagues, especially in the current cricket climate, is finding a spot in a packed calendar. SA20 has taken place at the same time as the Big Bash League (BBL in Australia), Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) and the Super Smash (in New Zealand).The next season's window has already been announced - between December 26, 2025 and January 26, 2026 - right before the T20 World Cup. And Season 5 is due to run between January-February 2027.""We've had that challenge right from the beginning. When we (were) building, Big Bash existed. ILT20 was also ahead of us in their planning, we just really focused on making sure we do our job. Our franchises have been incredible in terms of how they've managed players, acquired their talent,"" stated the 44-year-old.""I think the fact that we've got a good base of South African cricketers really does help. We've seen that the level gets better and better every year for the South African cricketers. I thought this year might be a challenge for the international players, but having said that, we've got our best crop of international players.""What I'm excited about is that we're attracting the real quality international cricketers. We never wanted to build an exhibition style league. When you chat to the players after the game, they say, 'the cricket is hard, it's very competitive, and this is where they want to be'.""The season will conclude at the Wanderers in Johannesburg with Sunrisers Eastern Cape looking to complete a hat-trick of titles. Standing in their way will be MI Cape Town.This season has been significantly bowler friendly with the 200-run mark being breached just six times with MICT posting the biggest total at 222/3. All three of the biggest totals this season had come at the Centurion which was spin-friendly on Wednesday and two-paced on Thursday.Smith wishes there were more edge-of-the-seat games this season. ""It's been very competitive. I think home ground advantage has grown this year. I think the fan loyalty has amazed me this year, like when I've arrived in stadiums and seen, you know, the Orange Army (fans of Sunrisers) in PE (Port Elizabeth) and then I go to Durban or yellow in Joburg (Johannesburg) and blue, and it's actually surprised me how fast people have got behind their teams.""Almost in the India style where they're not even cheering the opposition's success. So that's been amazing. Yeah, we would have liked maybe one or two closer games in the season, but (theres' been) some outstanding performances this year.""With South Africa due to co-host the 2027 ODI World Cup alongside Zimbabwe and Namibia, Smith cited pitches as one aspect that he wishes to improve for the future with the current crop ""quite worn.""As far as the future of the SA20 is concerned, he stressed on the importance of monitoring the global T20 businesses with IPL franchises acquiring stakes in teams in England's The Hundred. Smith expressed optimism in the SA20 being ""the number one choice"" outside the IPL and the format getting bigger with T20 being included in the programme for the LA 2028 Olympics.","South African T20 league celebrates its 100th game on Thursday. Graeme Smith says it is an ""emotional time"" for the league. The league is backed by Indian Premier League (IPL) team owners. Smith denies that the SA20 has an over- reliance on India and its market.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117997338,imgsize-76830,width-400,resizemode-4/117997338.jpg"

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

England have confirmed they will face Afghanistan in the Champions Trophy match scheduled for February 26 in Lahore, despite British politicians urging for a boycott.The England and Wales Cricket Board made this decision after discussions with the UK government, ICC, and England players, despite over 160 British politicians calling for the match to be cancelled.The boycott calls stemmed from the Taliban regime's ban on female sports participation since their return to power in 2021, which violates ICC regulations. However, the men's team is still permitted to compete.ECB chairman Richard Thompson said: ""We remain of the view that a coordinated international response by the cricketing community is the appropriate way forward, and will achieve more than any unilateral action by the ECB in boycotting this match.""He further added: ""We have also heard that for many ordinary Afghans, watching their cricket team is one of the few remaining sources of enjoyment. As such, we can confirm that we will play this fixture.""Afghanistan have shown significant improvement in limited-overs cricket, currently ranked eighth in ODI rankings, just below England who are seventh.The tournament will take place from February 19 to March 9 across Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. Both teams are placed in Group B alongside Australia and South Africa in this 50-over competition.","England will play Afghanistan in the Champions Trophy in Lahore on February 26.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

NEW DELHI: Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes the focus now shifts to Mohammed Shami as he returns from injury in India's ongoing limited-overs series against England. Shami, who last played for India, before the England series, in the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup final in November 2023, is seen as a crucial asset for the team ahead of the upcoming ICC Men's Champions Trophy ""My biggest concern about India when they came for Australia in the Test series was [Jasprit] Bumrah not having Shami there as a backup and him having to burden most of the load,"" Ponting said on The ICC Review.""And that's probably what happened, and might even have something to do with why he [Bumrah] got hurt. He probably ended up having to bowl a bit more in that series with Shami not being there.""So look, if Shami's fit, that's a positive.""Shami made his return in the third and fourth T20Is against England, putting up an impressive performance with figures of 3/25 in his latest outing.Former India head coach and cricketer Ravi Shastri emphasised the importance of managing Shami's workload in the upcoming ODI series against England.""It will be interesting to see if India play him out in all three, or they give him the first one and the third one, and then ease him into the Champions Trophy ,"" Shastri said.""But he'll be watched very closely because 10 overs is totally different to four overs, and then you're going to see how he pulls up in the field as well having bowled those 10 overs.""Shami's form and fitness will be crucial for India as they begin their ICC Men's Champions Trophy campaign against Bangladesh on February 20 in Dubai. With Bumrah already handling a significant workload, the return of a fully fit Shami could provide India with much-needed bowling depth and balance ahead of a crucial tournament.","Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes the focus now shifts to Mohammed Shami as he returns from injury.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

NEW DELHI: India's star all-rounder Hardik Pandya is brimming with confidence. He is eager to step onto the field, send the ball soaring into the stands, and rattle the stumps with his fiery bowling. Known for turning games on their head, Hardik Pandya is all set for the highly anticipated ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan and Dubai, starting from February 19.India will play all their ICC Champions Trophy matches at the Dubai International Stadium, beginning their campaign against Bangladesh on February 20.The much-awaited clash against arch-rivals Pakistan is set for February 23, followed by their final league-stage encounter against New Zealand on March 2.In an interview shared by the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Wednesday, Pandya reminisced about the electrifying 2022 T20 World Cup showdown between India and Pakistan in Melbourne - a match India won by four wickets.Having claimed three wickets in that game, the allrounder reflected on how he handled the immense pressure of the high-stakes encounter against Pakistan.""It is just about who handles pressure better. I don't play for Hardik Pandya; I play for the team. I play for India—that's the goal. Whether that means playing just two balls at the end or batting for 60 balls, the focus is on taking the game ball by ball and getting closer to victory. Let’s see who cracks under pressure,"" Pandya told in an interview posted by ICC.India began their T20 World Cup campaign against Pakistan, winning the toss and electing to field in front of a packed crowd at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground.""When I entered the field and saw the atmosphere—the kind of energy the fans and spectators were bringing—it was just amazing. I had to take a moment to absorb it. Even though I have played many games, it was overwhelming in a way that made me both excited and happy. The atmosphere for this match, especially since it was India vs. Pakistan, just took everything up a notch. This rivalry has existed for years. While we have intense competition on the field, there are also so many emotions involved. The engagement, the excitement—it's a clash that people remember and eagerly wait for.""My plan was very simple: to back my strengths and be smart about it. In the first two balls I bowled, I got a little too excited by the Australian bounce and the wicket. As a result, I bowled a couple of deliveries that turned out to be boundary balls in those conditions. When I came in for my second spell, we obviously needed wickets. I was aware that they were going to put the accelerator on and try to score boundaries to reach a decent total. That’s when I realized that sticking to good balls would be the key.""I have always been someone who relies on good length and lines—that is my strength. I definitely don’t have the variations or skill set of Jasprit Bumrah , but I do possess Hardik Pandya’s skill set. For me, bowling back-of-a-length deliveries has always been a strength. It's more about gamesmanship, awareness, and using my skills effectively.""I was aggressive—I wanted to take wickets. My mindset was: ‘If you want to hit me, hit me off a good ball.’ That approach helped me take those two wickets. Just before that, I had kept the mid-on and mid-wicket fielders up, but for that particular ball, I sent one fielder back because I sensed he was going to go after me. I knew where my deliveries were landing and where the most likely scoring areas were—especially mid-wicket. Taking those wickets was quite satisfying,"" Pandya, who dismissed Shadab Khan, Haider Ali and Mohammad Nawaz, said.India secured a thrilling four-wicket victory, driven by Virat Kohli 's masterful unbeaten 82 off 53 balls.","India's star all-rounder Hardik Pandya is brimming with confidence.

'Nothing new': Rohit Sharma on his struggles ahead of England ODIs

What does Shubman Gill's horoscope say about his captaincy future

Rohit Sharma's batting in ODIs has been game changing: Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer and ex-head coach Ravi Shastri understands the significance of the intense rivalry between India and Pakistan in international cricket. He recently shared his thoughts on current head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s remarks ahead of their highly anticipated ICC Champions Trophy clash.India and Pakistan, both placed in Group A of the tournament, will face off on February 23 in Dubai. The two teams last met at the venue in an ICC event in 2021, where Pakistan secured a dominant 10-wicket victory.Gambhir recently stated that the Champions Trophy group-stage match against Pakistan holds the same importance as any other fixture in the tournament, emphasizing that all games carry equal value.Speaking on the latest edition of The ICC Review, Shastri acknowledged that he had expressed a similar sentiment during his tenure as head coach but hinted that there is more to it than meets the eye.“I was the coach for seven years. Whenever I was asked, I said the same thing (as Gambhir). But let me assure you, deep down, there's a lot more to that than you actually think, that's for the media,” Shastri said.“You have to say it. But deep down, you want to win that. Because if you don't, you'll be reminded of it until the next time you play against Pakistan.“People don't care what you have done in the past. They're not bothered about the last 10 games if you won eight or you won nine. But they'll remind you if you lose one, until the next time you play them.“It can be a taxi driver, it could be anyone on the street. What happened to India? The same question to Pakistan. What happened to Pakistan? So it always plays on your mind, so whether you like it or not, it's a different game. Different beasts altogether.”Shastri, however, believes that the throwback won’t be taking up much headspace for Indian players.“No, that won't play on their mind because that was a T20 game. This is a 50-over clash. It's totally different,"" Shastri said.“And it's a longer game which suits India more, because in T20 you can get upset. In 50-over cricket, if you've got experience and you've got depth in your batting and bowling departments and you know, it makes a massive, massive difference.“And when you look at India and Pakistan man to man, India is a far better side and far more experienced as well.”",Former India head coach Ravi Shastri understands the significance of the rivalry between India and Pakistan in international cricket. The two teams will meet in the ICC Champions Trophy group stage on February 23 in Dubai. Gautam Gambhir recently stated that the group-stage match against Pakistan holds the same importance as any other fixture in the tournament.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117965535,imgsize-77034,width-400,resizemode-4/117965535.jpg"

NAGPUR: Always the talking point in cricket, Nagpur pitches haven’t been short of controversies. While the pitch was rated ‘poor’ by the ICC in 2015, the Test against Australia in 2023 also saw the visitors criticising the surface. For Thursday though, a fresh, hard surface has been rolled out for the first ODI between India and England.“It seems a 300+ wicket right now, with some help to the spinners in the second half. It looks grassy now, but it might be shaved off,” said a source from VCA.Indian vice-captain Shubman Gill reckoned the wicket will dry soon. “You can never really predict how the wicket is going to play. No instructions have been given by the Indian camp regarding the pitch. I haven't seen grass being shaved off the pitch. The wicket dries here soon, so they might have kept some grass so that the surface retains moisture,” he said while addressing the media.Only one Ranji Trophy match was played on the pitch between Vidarbha and Gujarat in November 2024. Vidarbha had posted 500+ runs and the match ended in a draw.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy","The pitch in Nagpur was rated 'poor' by the ICC in 2015.

He launched a counter-attack in his quick-fire 59 off 36, providing the hosts a much-needed momentum in the chase.After the win, Iyer said that he channeled his recent domestic experience to pull off a solid knock.""So (it is a) funny story. I was watching a movie last night. I thought that I could extend my night, but then I got a call from skipper saying that you may play because Virat has got a swollen knee,"" Iyer told Star Sports.""And then (I) hurried back to my room, went off to sleep straight away. I'm going to keep it low-key and just cherish this moment, the victory.""""I wasn't supposed to play the first game, Virat unfortunately got injured and then I got the opportunity. But I kept myself prepared, I knew that at any point of time I can get a chance to play,"" he said.Iyer continued, ""The same thing happened with me last year as well during the Asia Cup. I got injured and someone else came and he scored a century.""For someone who was debatably criticised for ignoring domestic cricket over IPL, Iyer credited his experience in last year or so for both his fitness and form.""To be honest, I played throughout the domestic season, it taught me a lot and gave me a decent idea about how to approach my innings, the attitude I have to keep and it's just the mindset that I've improved over a period of time,"" he said.""Also, from the skills point of view, you need to upgrade yourself, elevate and keep learning every now and then. I think I ticked all the boxes right and also my fitness played an important role,"" Iyer added.Iyer's recent domestic success includes two centuries, including a double in the Ranji Trophy, and leading Mumbai to victory in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy.Early in his innings, Iyer began with clobbering England express pacer Jofra Archer for a six over midwicket and another hit for maximum over the third man.The India No 4 acknowledged that it takes specific preparations to face high pace bowling.""I didn't decide that I would be playing in a particular way or I would be changing something,"" he said when asked about his tactics to handle short balls.""I haven't, throughout the domestic series as you see, I was playing with a similar back lift and stance and I, obviously if the bowler is bowling about 140-145, you would like to use the crease as much as possible and just to use the pace and guide the ball in the gaps, that was my mindset.""""In domestic cricket you don't get to face that quick deliveries, right? So, the side-armers which we play in the net session, we ask them to go on the body line as much as possible and try to use the pace and I'm glad that I was able to execute it well too,"" he said.Iyer said India were anticipating a chase in excess of 350 on Thursday.""The way they started, obviously we were anticipating that we would be chasing anywhere above 350 with that start,"" he said.""They were tremendous with their execution and obviously we've seen how they play over the years now.""Besides his success with the bat, Iyer looked sharp on the field and produced a moment of brilliance, running out the dangerous Salt with a bullet throw to KL Rahul.""I just attacked the ball (in run out against Phil Salt),"" he said.""(It) just happened in the spur of the moment, I didn't decide that I would be creating a run-out or anything but it was a great breakthrough, I feel,"" he said.",Shreyas Iyer scores 59 to help India win ODI series opener in Nagpur.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

'Salt run-out turning point'

NEW DELHI: India’s young pacer Harshit Rana brushed aside external criticism, emphasising that his sole focus is on contributing to the team's success.The 23-year-old right-arm quick shone on his ODI debut against England in Nagpur, grabbing 3/33 to help India secure a four-wicket victory and a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Having made his T20I debut last week, Rana impressed as a concussion substitute for Shivam Dube in Pune, a move that later drew criticism from England.

My only focus is to deliver for my country,"" Rana stated in the post-match press conference.Rana, who was included as cover for Jasprit Bumrah, revealed that he was mentally prepared for his debut.""You only get to know if you're playing when you arrive at the ground.

However, he staged a stunning comeback, dismissing Ben Duckett and Harry Brook in the same over.""Cricket has ups and downs. I just focused on my length and got my rewards later. I didn’t change anything in my second spell, just hit the right areas,"" Rana explained.Rana acknowledged the challenges of 50-over cricket, particularly the need to adapt across different phases of the game.""This format is tough because it’s long, and you need to play different roles at different times. But with proper practice, it becomes manageable,"" he remarked.England got off to a blistering start, thanks to Phil Salt's aggressive stroke play, but his innings was cut short by a mix-up and a brilliant throw from Shreyas Iyer. England skipper Jos Buttler admitted that Salt’s run-out was the turning point.""We had momentum at that point, and we needed to sustain the pressure. That’s been our challenge—holding onto momentum when we have it,"" Buttler said.Despite the loss, Buttler praised 21-year-old Jacob Bethell, who scored a gritty half-century.""I was watching him and thought, 'I don't remember batting this well at 21!' He was mature, composed, and handled pressure well. This experience will be invaluable for him,"" he added.India will look to seal the series when the two teams clash in the second ODI on Sunday.",Harshit Rana impressed on his ODI debut against England in Nagpur.

He emphasised their focus on maintaining consistent performance rather than pursuing specific goals.India secured a four-wicket win to take a 1-0 lead in the series. The team's performance was nearly flawless, despite losing three quick wickets near the end while chasing a modest target of 249 runs.""Nothing specific. Overall as a team, I just want us to keep making sure that we keep doing the right things as often as possible. There is nothing specific that we want to try and achieve,"" Rohit told the broadcaster after the match.""We want to try and tick every box that is there to be ticked in terms of bowling, batting and stuff like that. So (we) pretty much managed to do that today, although I felt we shouldn't have lost those wickets at the end.""""It would have been good, but again, guys are trying to put pressure back on the bowlers and while doing that things like this can happen,"" he said.Rohit expressed satisfaction with the team's performance, considering it was their first ODI in almost six months.""I'm pretty happy because we all knew that we're coming off from a long time playing this format so it was important for us to just regroup as quickly as possible and understand what is supposed to be done,"" he said.""This is a slightly longest format where you have time to come back into the game. When things start to go slightly away from you, it doesn't mean that it's going to keep going away.You have to try and pull things back and that is what exactly what we did. A lot of credit to all the bowlers there, everyone chipped in with that performance and it was important and necessary for us to keep that going,"" he said.

They lead the Premier League by six points, have advanced to the Champions League last 16, and face Plymouth in the FA Cup fourth round on Sunday.Tottenham's wait for silverware continues since their last triumph in 2008. Postecoglou's pledge to secure a trophy in his second season faces another setback.The Australian manager's position could be at risk if they falter against Aston Villa in the FA Cup, whilst struggling in 14th place in the Premier League.Slot demonstrated his commitment to the League Cup by fielding his strongest available side, with Caoimhin Kelleher replacing Alisson Becker in goal for cup matches.Tottenham's injury-hit defence saw Kevin Danso make his debut, while Mathys Tel came on early after Richarlison's injury departure.Liverpool overcame their 1-0 first leg deficit, maintaining their recent scoring form against Spurs at Anfield.After a measured start, the hosts gained momentum. Szoboszlai's initial effort was ruled offside, but Gakpo soon became the competition's leading scorer with his fifth goal.Antonin Kinsky denied Salah initially, but Richarlison's injury further weakened Tottenham's depleted attacking options.Missing several key forwards including Dominic Solanke, Brennan Johnson, James Maddison, Timo Werner and Wilson Odobert, Tottenham struggled to respond.Early in the second half, Kinsky fouled Nunez, allowing Salah to convert his 26th goal this season from the penalty spot.Liverpool maintained pressure with Gakpo and Gravenberch hitting the woodwork.Szoboszlai added a third goal, assisted by the impressive Connor Bradley, who filled in for the injured Trent Alexander-Arnold.Van Dijk completed the scoring with a header from a corner, emphasising Tottenham's defensive frailties.Newcastle, who defeated Arsenal 4-0 on aggregate in their semi-final, seek to end their 56-year trophy drought but face a formidable challenge against Slot's in-form side.","Liverpool beat Tottenham 4-0 at Anfield to reach the League Cup final.

KOLKATA: Jamshedpur FC coach Khalid Jamil achieved an Indian Super League first 'double' over the weekend, when he became the first head coach — and also, the first Indian — to score a league double over Manolo Marquez , the FC Goa and current India coach. On Sunday, Jamil's Jamshedpur beat the Goans 3-1. In their away fixture in September last year, Khalid's men had won 2-1, their first game of the season.""All the credit goes to the players. They are working very hard and are motivated. They knew that the game was important and I just told them to give their best and play their natural game,"" Jamil told the broadcasters' post-match interview afterwards.Jamil corners a fair share of the credit as well. This is not the first time that he has been successful in ISL. In the 2020-21 season, he guided North East United FC to the playoffs — also a first by an Indian coach. This time, Jamshedpur have reached the second spot since they won the Shield under Owen Coyle in 2021-22. Furthermore, at home this season they have been unbeaten in nine of their ten games.On what this meant for the Indian coaches in the ISL, former India player and Bengaluru FC assistant coach Renedy Singh said, ""I'm happy that his season is going well, but it hasn't finished yet. Jamil should just continue and I'm sure a lot of Indian coaches will be hoping that he succeeds so that the others can follow.""That Khalid completely outsmarted his counterpart on Sunday, was quite evident from what Manolo said after the match. ""We didn't know how to play against them,"" conceded Manolo, ""In the first half if the score was 4-0 for them, it was fair. We started okay in the second, but when they scored their second ...

NEW DELHI: In a captivating encounter at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea overturned a deficit to secure a 2-1 victory against West Ham in the Premier League 's latest London derby.This triumph, marking only their second in eight matches, propelled Chelsea into the fourth position in the league standings, positioning them two points clear of Manchester City and trailing Nottingham Forest by four points. Meanwhile, West Ham's challenges persist as they stay in 15th place.The match saw the return of England forward Jarrod Bowen for West Ham after a six-game absence due to a foot injury.Bowen made a significant impact, putting West Ham ahead shortly before the half-time break.The opportunity arose from a misjudged back pass by Levi Colwill, which Bowen capitalized on with a precise left-footed shot that found the net, beating Chelsea's goalkeeper Filip Jørgensen.Jørgensen was in the lineup in place of Robert Sanchez, who was sidelined due to a dip in form.Chelsea's response came in the 64th minute, amidst a period when West Ham appeared to be gaining the upper hand. Enzo Fernandez's attempt was initially thwarted on the goal line, but Pedro Neto, coming on as a substitute, managed to score on the rebound.The goal stood following a prolonged review and despite protests from West Ham players who alleged a foul on Bowen during the lead-up to the goal.The decisive moment for Chelsea came with 16 minutes remaining when Cole Palmer's attempt from a challenging angle was inadvertently deflected into West Ham's net by defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka, tilting the outcome in Chelsea's favour.Post-match, Jarrod Bowen expressed disappointment, highlighting the effort put forth by West Ham.""Just disappointed to be leading and lose the game,"" Bowen said. ""We left everything out there. We came to a side who are pushing for top four, pushing for the title. On another day, I think it could have been a different result.""The match also marked a less-than-favourable return for Graham Potter, the recently appointed West Ham coach, to Stamford Bridge.Potter, who was dismissed from his role at Chelsea in April 2023 after a tenure of less than seven months, experienced defeat in his first game against his former club since his departure.","Chelsea beat West Ham 2-1 in the Premier League's latest London derby.

NEW DELHI: The January transfer window witnessed significant activity from several top clubs as they sought to bolster their squads for the remainder of the season and beyond.Manchester City, the four-time defending Premier League champions, made a late splash by securing the services of Porto midfielder Nico Gonzalez for a reported fee of $60 million.This move was aimed at addressing the void left by the long-term injury to their defensive midfield lynchpin, Rodri.Aston Villa, currently competing in the Champions League , also made notable additions to their attacking ranks. They secured the loan signing of Marco Asensio from Real Madrid until the end of the season, adding Champions League-winning experience to their squad.Additionally, Villa acquired Marcus Rashford on loan from Manchester United, a player who had fallen out of favour but possesses immense potential to contribute to their European and domestic campaigns.Elsewhere, the uncertainty surrounding Bayern Munich forward Mathys Tel was resolved as he completed a loan move to Tottenham Hotspur, with the option of a permanent deal in the summer.Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) were one of the busiest clubs during the window, signing Khvicha Kvaratskhelia from Napoli for a reported $72 million, while also offloading several players, including Randal Kolo Muani, Milan Skriniar, and Asensio.Manchester City's spending spree, which exceeded $200 million, was a bid to salvage a campaign that had unravelled towards the end of the previous year and was further derailed by a 5-1 loss to Arsenal.In addition to Gonzalez, City acquired Egypt forward Omar Marmoush, defenders Abdukodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis, and young left-back Christian McFarlane from their sister club, New York City FC.PSG's acquisition of Kvaratskhelia represents a return to their previous strategy of marquee signings, albeit with a focus on younger talents rather than established superstars.This move comes after the departures of high-profile players like Lionel Messi, Neymar, and Kylian Mbappé in recent years.The Saudi Arabian league also made headlines, with Jhon Duran joining Al-Nassr from Aston Villa for a reported $80 million.However, the highly anticipated move of Neymar to Al-Hilal was cut short, as the Brazilian's contract was terminated, and he returned to his boyhood club, Santos.In the women's game, significant deals were also made, with US defender Naomi Girma becoming the first million-dollar player in the women's game as she moved from the San Diego Wave to Chelsea.The Blues also spent heavily to bring England midfielder Keira Walsh back to the Women's Super League from Barcelona.","The January transfer window witnessed significant activity from several top clubs.

MUMBAI: It didn't seem like Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi had done much wrong. She had just completed a 6-4, 6-1 over Belarusian Iryna Shymanovich, finishing the match exactly how she had started it, with an ace. It was not just her first round match of the L&T Mumbai Open , this was her WTA main draw debut, and for most part, the 15-year-old looked to have ticked a lot of the right boxes judging by the applause she drew from the Cricket Club of India crowd here on Tuesday.And yet, the promising teenager wasn't totally pleased with her performance while reflecting on it later. “Well, one thing is that I think I played my qualifying rounds better than today. So one thing that I'm happy about is that I managed to win even though I didn't play my best today,” Maaya would say.Winning despite not being at your best! That's a trait that the man whose famous academy Maaya currently trains at often fell back on over the course of his storied career. For now, she is still in the early days of her one-year stint at the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca, and apart from saying “it's going good” and mentioning a “small conversation” she had with Toni, Rafa's uncle and long-time coach, there's not much else Maaya can share just yet.Her racket, however, did the talking against the 225th-ranked Shymanovich, who, Maaya happened to learn would be her opponent “just five minutes” before she was to step on court.As she and Shymanovich were hitting to each other in the warm-up, a livescoring app still showed Yuriko Miyazaki of Great Britain as Maaya's opponent. Miyazaki was forced to withdraw due to illness.Did the late twist throw Maaya off in any way? “Nah, because either way, I didn't know anything about my previous opponent. The same applies to this (player),” the Coimbatore girl grinned.There was notable support for Maaya in the crowd as Grand Slam doubles champion Rohan Bopanna followed the youngster's progress over the first set. “I'm really honoured to have him here because I think he flew down to watch this match and I'm really happy that he was here,” she said.Tuesday's win coupled with her two victories in the qualifiers have earned Maaya 21 WTA ranking points, taking her total points tally to 24 and earning her an entry into the WTA rankings.She will take on Zarina Diyas in the second round, after the Kazakh eliminated defending champion Darja Semenistaja 6-3, 6-3.Meanwhile, Ankita Raina and Shrivalli Bhamidipaty were the other Indian players to advance to the last 16 stage on Tuesday. Raina proved too strong for compatriot Vaishnavi Adkar, coming through 6-2, 6-2, while Bhamidipaty produced a devastating display to take out the 182nd-ranked Elena Pridankina of Russia 6-1, 6-0 in just 64 minutes.","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi beat Belarusian Iryna Shymanovich 6-4, 6-1.

This victory marks a significant achievement for the 27-year-old Indian, displaying his ability to recover and dominate after an initial setback.Nagal's next opponent will be determined by the outcome of the match between Tseng Chun-hsin from Chinese Taipei and Bolivia's Hugo Dellien .This triumph comes at a crucial time for Nagal, who recently experienced a decline in his professional standing.Prior to this event, he had fallen out of the ATP top-100 rankings, a position he had maintained for 10 consecutive months since March 2024.This drop was attributed to a series of disappointing performances, with Nagal securing only three main draw victories in 18 tournaments since Wimbledon 2024.Despite this, his earlier entry into the top-100 in February 2024, following a commendable performance at a Grand Slam event, underscores his potential and skill on the international stage.In related developments within Indian tennis, veteran doubles player Rohan Bopanna , aged 44, has also experienced a setback, falling five places to No. 21 in the rankings.This decline followed an early exit from the Australian Open, where he was unable to defend the points from his previous championship win.Bopanna's attempt to retain his standing, alongside new partner Nicolas Barrientos, ended prematurely in the opening round of the competition.Other Indian players, including Sasikumar Mukund, Ramkumar Ramanathan, Karan Singh, and Aryan Shah, maintain their positions within the top-600 in singles rankings.In doubles, alongside Bopanna, players such as Yuki Bhambri, N Sriram Balaji, Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli, and Arjun Kadhe are within the top-100.","Indian tennis player Sumit Nagal secured his place in the pre-quarterfinals following a resilient victory against Argentina's Renzo Olivo.

The player defended his stand in a lengthy post on social media, saying ""it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country"".Amritraj , who worked with Nagal when he held the role of captain a few years ago, described the idea as ""inconceivable"".""To me personally, it is just inconceivable that if you are ranked high enough and the country wants you to play, that you would play without any financial compensation,"" Amritraj told reporters here on the sidelines of the L&T Mumbai Open at the Cricket Club of India on Monday.""Unless you are injured and you can't walk on the court, other than that, there should be no question that you're going to play Davis Cup. Same for me, same for Vijay,"" he added, referring to his brother with whom he helped India reach the 1974 Davis Cup finals against South Africa.""Both of us felt that it is the greatest honour that you can have to play for your country. Maybe this is old-school thinking, but that is absolutely how it should be.""You got 50 weeks in the year to make money, two weeks of the year, you should be able to give to places you grew up in, and it should be an honour and a privilege.""On Nagal's case, the 73-yearold said: ""I like Sumit, when I was captain he was the reserve on my team five years ago. I got along very well with him, but he didn't play the last tie (vs Sweden in Sept) either, which is really a shame because he is our best player right now.""Asked if there should be strong repercussions for players who choose to not turn up for national team duties, Amritraj said it was a tricky situation as players could always lean on the ""independence of the ATP Tour "" to make their decisions.With some Indian players, however, enjoying government funding through programmes like the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), it could be a way for Aita to crack the whip, Amritraj felt.""That's where you should put the screws on them. I think you should definitely do that. If you're in any kind of place with some leverage, you should say: 'Either you play Davis Cup, or you won't get this'. Simple.""","Top-ranked players Sumit Nagal and Yuki Bhambri turned down chance to represent India.

Even in a home tournament, India, in the absence of Nagal, is forced to rely on wildcards for main-draw singles entries as the next-best players from the country find it difficult to directly make the cut. Davis Cuppers Mukund Sasikumar (ranked 365), Ramkumar Ramanathan (406) and Karan Singh will have a point to prove after being awarded wildcards by the organisers.The onus will be on the experienced Ramkumar and Mukund to gain valuable points to move up in the rankings chart. The 28-year-old Mukund had a good run in Chennai last year, reaching the quarterfinals, but could not carry forward the momentum in the tournaments that followed. Ramkumar’s story in the past few years has not been much different, with the 30-year-old’s inconsistency hampering his chances to move to a higher level. Youngster Karan has shown promise in the early stages of his career and is steadily rising up the ladder.Moving to foreign interest, quite a few players are looking to resurrect their careers and compete in the Grand Slams. For instance, Lloyd Harris, who is the second seed in singles, was once ranked as high as 31 and reached the quarterfinals of the US Open in 2021. Injury issues forced the South African to stay away from action for quite a long period and the 27-year-old will compete in his first match since the Wimbledon last year.Former world No. 35 Jiri Vesely had to sit out in 2023 due to injury concerns. The 31-year-old had won the ATP 250 title in Pune in 2020 and had a good time in India in the past. Ahead of the Chennai Open, Vesely said: “Preparations have been good and I am getting used to the weather, but it is not easy. It is always nice to be in India and people are very friendly and supportive. I love coming back here and I hope to have a good run on this trip.”Vesely dropped outside the top-600 a few years ago and since then, he has found it tough to be back to his best. “I wish to move up and it is not easy. A lot of youngsters are playing well and I need to compete with them and give my best.”","India's top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has made good strides in recent years.

CHENNAI: Italian tennis player Jacopo Berrettini does not have to look far for inspiration. The 26-year-old shares a strong bond with his elder brother Matteo Berrettini , a former top-10 singles player and 2021 Wimbledon finalist, whom he regards not only his best friend but also his idol.“I have a good relationship with him. He is a very good human, and I am so glad and lucky to have him. Apart from on-court training, he mentors me off the field and is a good coach. We shared the same (coaching) team for the past three years and now share the same trainer. Before coming here, we trained together for three days in Rome,” Jacopo, who will begin his season at the Chennai Open Challenger , told TOI on Saturday.Jacopo and Matteo had a tough 2023 as their seasons were marred by injuries. Matteo had to take a six-month break, while Jacopo had to miss the majority of the year. In that period, the Berrettini brothers helped each other stay mentally strong. “It was a very tough period for us, for our family. We were trying to be the humans that we are, trying to stay mentally focused and healthy. We had to work a lot after recovery because this sport is so tough mentally and physically. We were trying to enjoy life outside the sport as it is very important as well. After suffering from a lot of injuries, Matteo had a good season last year,” Jacopo added.While Jacopo and Matteo do not spend much time together due to their playing commitments, they are always in touch. “We try to talk often and as much as we can. Sometimes, we train together, but if we are not able to spend a lot of time, it is okay since we travel and play regularly. We are healthy and that is a good thing for us.”‘Aim to carry forward momentum’: Jacopo had a productive season last year and achieved his career-best singles ranking of 317. The Italian will look to carry forward the momentum, starting with his season opener in Chennai. “It was a good year (2024) for me, playing many matches without any injury concerns. I worked on many aspects and will try to keep going. My goal for this year is to compete in the qualifiers of the Grand Slams, for which I have to get close to the 230 mark (rankings).”",Italian tennis player Jacopo Berrettini shares a strong bond with his elder brother Matteo.

Davis Cup: India return to Group 1 with 4-0 win over Togo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/davis-cup-india-return-to-group-1-with-4-0-win-over-togo/articleshow/117873861.cms,"NEW DELHI: India returned to the Davis Cup World Group 1 with a comprehensive 4-0 win over Togo in the Playoff here at the DLTA complex on Sunday. The hosts, who had taken a commanding 2-0 lead by winning the first two singles on the opening day of the tie on Saturday, completed the formality with two dominant wins - in doubles and singles - on Sunday. The fifth rubber was not played. The World Group 1 tie would be played in September later this year and the name of their opponents would be announced later.The doubles pair of Sriram Balaji and Davis Cup debutant Rithvik Bollipalli put the hosts ahead in the fourth game when they broke M'lapa Akomlo, the substitute for regular player Thomas Setodji who pulled out with an injury. Akomlo proved to be the weak link as the Indians, playing some smart tennis with clever ball placement and strong net presence, broke his service to take the set 6-2. The second set was even shorter as the Indians broke Akomlo and his partner Isak Padio once each to claim the set 6-1. The match lasted 57 minutes.With the tie secured, India gave rookie Karan Singh his Davis Cup debut in the dead rubber and the 21-year-old did not disappoint as he beat Isak, whom Togo fielded in place of original choice Setodji. The 20-year-old in fact put up the best show by a Togolese player on the trip as he stretched most of the games. He even managed to break Singh once in the second set as India won the match 6-2, 6-3 - the first instance when Togo won three games in a set on this tour.""I started playing tennis when I was an 11-year-old and I had no idea how far I would go. I just kept going day by day. And here we are today. And I really enjoyed playing the match today. All the teammates were really cheering me,"" Karan later said.The other Davis Cup debutant Bollipalli shared his thoughts: ""Playing in Davis Cup is a different feeling. It's a little bit different from the regular matches that we play.""'Grooming future captain'Interestingly, once India won the doubles match and the Playoff, regular captain Rohit Rajpal took a backseat and allowed Mukund Sasikumar occupy the captain's chair during the fourth rubber, played by Karan Singh. The captain's chairs are placed next to the chair umpire so that the players could consult with the captains during game breaks. ""I always do that. Sometimes it's as important as grooming players. Sitting on that chair has a different kind of pressure you need that experience. It's good for them. They'll be the future captains. We'll come and go as seniors, but these guys are here to stay,"" Rajpal said.","India return to the Davis Cup World Group 1 with a comprehensive 4-0 win over Togo in the Playoff.

Elise Mertens secured her first WTA title in 17 months on Sunday, defeating unseeded Ann Li in straight sets to claim the Singapore Tennis Open.The second-seeded Belgian, who had fallen to McCartney Kessler in the Hobart International final last month, showcased her dominance at the Kallang Tennis Centre , winning 75 percent of her first-serve points to overpower the American 6-1, 6-4.Li had not dropped a set en route to the final but struggled with her serve early on, allowing Mertens to capitalize with three service breaks to wrap up the opening set in just 26 minutes.The American was broken again at the start of the second set but responded by breaking Mertens for the first time in the following game, settling into a better rhythm on serve.However, serving to stay in the match at 4-5, Li committed a pair of unforced errors, handing Mertens the victory after one hour and 22 minutes. The win marked Mertens' ninth career WTA singles title and her first since triumphing at the Monastir Open in Tunisia in October 2023.In the doubles final, second seeds Desirae Krawczyk of the United States and Giuliana Olmos of Mexico clinched the title with a commanding 7-5, 6-0 victory over the third-seeded Chinese duo of Wang Xinyu and Zheng Saisai.","Elise Mertens defeated Ann Li 6-1, 6-4 to win the Singapore Tennis Open.

NEW DELHI: N Sriram Balaji and Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli secured India's place in the Davis Cup World Group I with a commanding straight-set victory , handing the hosts an unassailable 3-0 lead against Togo in the play-off tie on Sunday.With a 2-0 advantage, India needed to win just one of the three matches, and the duo of Balaji and Bollipalli accomplished the task in the opening contest against M'lapa Tingou Akomolo and Hod'abalo Isak Padio, winning 6-2, 6-1 in just 57 minutes at the DLTA Complex .Togo replaced their top player, Thomas Setodji, with M'lapa Tingou Akomolo due to an arm injury, which proved detrimental as Akomolo struggled to hold serve throughout the match. Balaji's serving was exceptional, losing only one point on his serve during the entire contest.The Indians gained their first break when Akomolo served in the third game, and from there, it was a one-sided affair. Bollipalli, making his debut, overcame initial nerves and settled into the match, contributing significantly to the victory.The pair's experience of winning a Challenger together last year proved advantageous, as they displayed a straightforward and efficient performance. India is likely to give young Karan Singh a debut in the dead rubber match.Balaji and Bollipalli's convincing straight-set victory sealed India's place in the Davis Cup World Group I, showcasing their dominance and leaving Togo with little chance for a comeback.","N Sriram Balaji and Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli secured India's place in the Davis Cup World Group I with a commanding straight-set victory.

They were tamed in front of 1500-odd fans by India's Mukund Sasikumar and Ramkumar Ramanathan in less than two hours of p lay, in just 29 games, on the DLTA hard court.The contest looked on for the first three games of the first match when Mukund was tested by Liova Ajavon, who even came close to breaking the Indian in the third game.

Togo captain Alisama Agnamba later disclosed that Setodji, who played with adhesive tapes on his right hand, competed with an injury. The captain, however, did not reveal the nature of injury and whether the player would be available for his Sunday's doubles and reverse singles matches.""We played unforced, error-free tennis for the most part,"" Mukund later said. ""I'm happy with myself with the way I handled the whole situation. I think I put up a very mature performance. There was a lot of composure. I stuck to the plan, kept things very simple and did the job that I was supposed to do.""Ramkumar was happy with his service game. ""It was a good serving day. I didn't expect it to be,"" he quipped.

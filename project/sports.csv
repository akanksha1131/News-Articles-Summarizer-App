What does Shubman Gill's horoscope say about his captaincy future

NEW DELHI: India pacer Harshit Rana made history on Friday during the fourth match of the five-match T20I series against England, becoming the first player to make a T20I debut mid-match as a concussion substitute among full-member teams.Rana replaced all-rounder Shivam Dube, who was struck on the back of the head by a Jamie Overton delivery in the final over of India’s innings.While the move proved crucial in India’s 15-run victory, it also sparked an intense debate over the fairness of the substitution.Former England captain Michael Vaughan was among the most vocal critics, questioning whether Rana was a genuine ""like-for-like"" replacement for Dube. The decision became even more contentious after Rana claimed three wickets for 33 runs, playing a decisive role in restricting England to 166 while chasing India’s total of 181.""I have to say the substitute — how did they find that Harshit Rana is a like-for-like for Shivam Dube? An out-and-out bowler replacing a batter who can bowl some part-time stuff is beyond me,"" Vaughan said while speaking on Cricbuzz. ""He gets three for 33, key wickets at the key times… You can’t sell me that Harshit Rana is a like-for-like replacement for Shivam Dube.""India’s move was also scrutinised by former India pacer Zaheer Khan , who acknowledged that while teams have the right to nominate a player, the match referee should have ensured that the replacement met the criteria.""Maybe Ramandeep [Singh] would have been the ideal choice,"" Zaheer said. ""The match referee’s role was to say, ‘Okay, you have nominated this player, but he doesn’t suit the criteria exactly, so suggest another player who is actually a batter who can bowl, rather than a bowler who can bat.’""Despite the controversy, India’s performance on the field was dominant. Hardik Pandya (53) and Dube (53) rescued the team from 79 for 5, forging an 87-run partnership that helped India post a competitive 181 for 9. In response, England faltered against India’s bowling attack, with Rana and leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi (3 for 56) leading the charge.The victory extended India’s unbeaten T20I series streak at home to 17 since 2019 and sealed a 3-1 series win over England. However, the debate surrounding Rana’s substitution is likely to continue, with calls for greater clarity in concussion replacement rules.","India pacer Harshit Rana made history on Friday during the fourth match of the five-match T20I series against England.

NEW DELHI: Harshit Rana made a memorable entry into international cricket, delivering a match-winning spell of 3-33 on his T20I debut as India secured a 15-run victory over England in the fourth T20I at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium on Friday night. The victory gave India an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series.Rana’s dramatic introduction as a concussion substitute for Shivam Dube proved decisive, as he dismantled England’s middle and lower order just when the visitors appeared to be regaining momentum in their chase of 182.""It is still a dream debut for me,"" said an elated Rana after the match. ""When Dube came back, after two overs I was informed I would be the concussion substitute.

England openers put on 62 runs inside powerplay, before Indian bowlers clawed back with regular wickets. Apart from Rana, Ravi Bishnoi returned figures of 3 for 28, while Varun Chakaravarthy took two wickets for 28 runs.With this win, India secured the series 3-1, heading into the final T20I at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai with the series already in the bag.

SA20: Joburg Super Kings boost playoff hopes with victory over Paarl Royals

SA20 witnessed a breathtaking avalanche of runs as Pretoria Capitals and MI Cape Town lit up a sold-out Centurion on Friday night. Despite lightning and thundershowers briefly interrupting MI Cape Town’s innings, the excitement remained undimmed as the two sides combined for a staggering 417 runs in a batting spectacle.With bowlers having dominated the early stages of Season 3, this contest belonged to the batters, reminiscent of last season’s record-breaking 462-run encounter at the same venue.Unfortunately for the home crowd, the Capitals fell 27 runs short of MI Cape Town’s imposing total of 222/3, officially ending their playoff hopes. Sunrisers Eastern Cape and Joburg Super Kings have now secured their spots in the Eliminator, set to be played at Centurion on February 5.MI Cape Town’s innings began with a fiery start as Rassie van der Dussen (30 off 20 balls) and Ryan Rickelton (22 off 13 balls) smashed 45 runs in just 4.4 overs.However, the real fireworks came from Reeza Hendricks and Dewald Brevis , who delivered a masterclass in shot-making. The duo forged a stunning 142-run partnership off just 68 balls for the fourth wicket, with Hendricks finishing unbeaten on 77 off 44 balls (4x4, 5x6) and Brevis hammering 73 not out off 32 balls (6x4, 6x6).""Absolutely (happy) for us to have a few wins on the bounce and play beautiful cricket. I am so excited for the boys! We played so great as a team and it's even better off the field,"" Brevis said.""I have been working really hard in my off time. It's the quiet time where you graft on your game and speak to the people who really care and most importantly enjoy the game and play with a smile and do whatever you can for the team.""The Capitals fought valiantly in their chase, with Will Smeed (52 off 36 balls, 9x4) notching up his second half-century of the competition. However, MI Cape Town’s bowlers struck at crucial moments, restricting the home team to 195/8.""Batted nicely in parts but just didn't find the rhythm. Key wickets at key times left us short. I think it was a good wicket and I think we had a chance – just didn't pull it off,"" said Capitals skipper Kyle Verreynne.""Our first five games came in 8-9 days or something like that. If you don't get off to a good start, it's tough to bring that back. In saying that, I think we played nice cricket and lost games along the way, which is disappointing. Been tough to get that rhythm and momentum. That's why we are where we are.""The two teams will face off again on Sunday at Newlands before MI Cape Town heads to St George’s Park for their Qualifier 1 showdown against Paarl Royals on February 4.","Pretoria Capitals fall 27 runs short of MI Cape Town's total of 222/3.

NEW DELHI: Since such ""unfathomable"" behavior can be interpreted as a ""sign of weakness,"" former Pakistan captain Moin Khan has advised the nation's cricket players to refrain from making friends with their Indian counterparts on the field.His remarks came approximately three weeks prior to the two teams' Champions Trophy meeting on February 23 in Dubai.Moin, a chatty and aggressive wicketkeeper-batter in his heyday, said being friendly with Indian players is something that he finds baffling.""I just don't get it when I watch Pakistan and India matches these days, as Indian players come into the crease our players check their bats, pat them, have a friendly talk,"" said the former head coach and chief selector during a podcast hosted by actor Ushna Shah.""Nowadays, our players' behaviour when playing against India is unfathomable to me.

Madness! Thousands welcome 'King' Virat Kohli

Virat Kohli's love for chilli paneer takes over social media

All roads in Delhi led to the Arun Jaitley Stadium for the last two days, with the national capital in the grip of Virat Kohli fever, as the batting legend made his return to Ranji Trophy after 12 years.Crowd in excess of 15,000 witnessed Kohli playing for Delhi once again on Thursday, while many more thronged the stadium on Friday in anticipation of watching Kohli bat after Delhi had bowled out Railways on Day 1.The scenes of fans chanting Kohli's name reverberated the lanes leading up to the stadium gates and then echoed inside the arena, with the legend, who was fielding in the slips, interacting with the crowd on several occasions.Watching these scenes unfold, former Pakistan batter Basit Ali was in awe of the adulation and love that Kohli received from his fans.""I have seen very few players in my life, maybe just 2-3, who had such fan-following,"" said Basit on his YouTube channel. ""Aaj to Pakistan mei bhi trend bana hua tha. Sab likh rahe, 'dekho, izzat isko bolte hain' (even people in Pakistan were writing, 'see, this is called respect').""Yeh banda Delhi se kyu nahi khelta IPL mei, RCB se kyu khelta hai? (why he doesn't play for Delhi in the IPL instead of RCB),"" he cheekily added.On the first day, after Delhi captain Ayush Badoni opted to field and the fans had to wait to watch the legend bat, Kohli was seen having fun on the field, while keeping his intensity up.""He was enjoying with his old friends and the public. The fans were just waiting for him to respond and chanting 'Kohli, Kohli' for seven hours straight,"" Basit observed.""Despite not being in good form lately, he is blessed by the almighty with so much respect; I have seen that for the first time in my life for an out-of-form player.""However, the fan-fare had an anti-climax on Friday, when Kohli was dismissed for just 6 runs by Railways pacer Himanshu Sangwan -- a product of the MRF Pace Foundation under Australian legend Glenn McGrath.After hitting Sangwan for a four straight past him, Kohli played a loose shot and left a huge gap between his bat and pad, which the bowler found with his in-cutter to send the off-stump cartwheeling.The dismissal extended Kohli's poor run of form, which saw him scoring just 191 runs in 9 innings of the five Tests on the tour of Australia.","Virat Kohli returns to Ranji Trophy after 12 years with Delhi. 15,000 fans throng Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi to watch him bat.

J&K on top vs Baroda

MUMBAI: At the start of the season, Siddhesh Lad and Akash Anand didn't know what the future holds for them. Lad was just happy to be back in the Mumbai set up while Anand was grinding on the maidans hoping for an opportunity to come by.On Friday, both made hay by scoring centuries-along with Shams Mulani-to put Mumbai in the driver's seat against Meghalaya on Day Two of their Ranji Trophy clash at the BKC.Mumbai declared their innings at 671/7 to take a mammoth 585-run lead and by stumps had reduced Meghalaya to 27/2 in their second innings.Lad ended as Mumbai's top-scorer with his 250-ball 145 while right-hand batter Akash scored 151-ball 103.Lad now has become Mumbai's top-scorer for the season by overtaking Shreyas Iyer (480). So far, he has scored 518 runs in eight innings at an average of 86.33. They were well-supported by Ajinkya Rahane , Suryansh Shedge, Shardul Thakur and Mulani.While skipper Rahane missed out on a century and was out on 96, he shared a 327-ball 196 run third wicket stand with Lad which put Mumbai on their way. Shedge did his reputation no harm with his 74-ball 61 and was involved in a 123-run association for the fifth wicket with Akash. Shardul Thakur and Shams Mulani proved their worth with the bat by stitching a 99-ball 156 partnership for the seventh wicket. Thakur hammered a 42-ball 84 while Mulani scored an unbeaten 115-ball 100.Despite the runs, there is no guarantee that Lad will be the first choice when India players return for the knockouts. But he wants to be ready. ""I never thought that I would be playing for Mumbai again. (Now) I always play as if it's my last game,"" said the 32-year-old Lad, who played for Goa in 2022-23, took a cooling break in 2023-24 to be eligible for Mumbai this season.For 29-year-old Akash it was just about believing in his ability. ""I played cricket not to get selected but for the love of it,"" said Akash, who captains CCI.He finally got that call before the match against Services-the fifth of the Ranji campaign for Mumbai-thanks to good knocks in Kanga League A Division.But as he was getting ready for the white ball tournaments, he fractured his wrist during the Purshottam Shield match. Mumbai were looking for a wicketkeeper who would provide them flexibility in the batting order.Akash was the third keeper Mumbai have used in the Ranji XI after Hardik Tamore and Siddhant Addhatrao and he ticked that box with a century.Mumbai were taking a punt when they brought in Akash for this match in place of Tamore as he hadn't played any matches since that injury last year. ""This knock was very important for me before the knockouts as I wanted to have that feeling that I belong here,"" he added.Meghalaya 86 & 27/2 vs Mumbai 671/7 decl in 140.5 overs (Siddhesh Lad 145, Ajinkya Rahane 96, Akash Anand 103, Suryansh Shedge 61, Shams Mulani 100*, Shardul Thakur 84; Himan Phukan 3/144)In the other Group A match, Jammu & Kashmir strengthen their knockout bid by taking the first innings lead against Baroda. J&K shot out the hosts for 166 and then reached 125/1 in their second innings to extend their lead to 205.","Siddhesh Lad and Akash Anand score centuries to put Mumbai in driver's seat.

Brief scores:

NEW DELHI: When Delhi batter Yash Dhull's struggles at the crease finally ended an hour into the second day's play against Railways on Friday morning, the Ferozeshah Kotla crowd erupted in joy. It was time for the main act. Virat Kohli marched out to the middle - to bat in a Ranji Trophy game for the first time in over 12 y ears - to loud chants of ""Kohli, Kohli"" and ""RCB, RCB"".However, the thousands who had turned up were left disappointed as Kohli's stay at the crease didn't long.After facing 15 balls and hitting one cracking boundary down the ground, Himanshu Sangwan 's gentle inswinger sent Kohli's offstump cartwheeling. India's star batter trudged off after having scored just six runs, his head bowed, while Sangwan indulged in some animated celebrations. The crowd was stunned into silence. The show was over. The stadium was almost empty by the time Kohli could walk up to the pavilion.It didn't matter that Delhi captain Ayush Badoni played a thrilling knock of 99 off 77 and allrounder Sumit Mathur remained unbeaten on 78 at stumps to take Delhi to 334/7 in reply to Railways' first-innings score of 241. The few who had stayed back thronged the fencing next to the pavilion where Kohli was seated in the balcony, their eyes fixed firmly on him.Meanwhile, social media had gone into a tizzy, as usual, with Kohli fans hurling abuses at 29-year-old Sangwan, who incidentally made his Delhi U-19 debut along with Rishabh Pant The Railways bowler had been promoted to the post of a senior ticket examiner before the match, but knocking Kohli over will be etched in his memory forever.It may just be an inconsequential domestic match, but Kohli's problems against the moving ball around the off stump are real. The Railways seamers were, at best, bowling military-medium pace, but they didn't deviate from the plan of sticking to a line and length with the newish ball. Kohli had been beaten twice on the outside edge by Kunal Yadav in the previous over.The distinct lack of pace teased Kohli. Then ego got the better of him and he started walking towards the ball. It paid off when he shimmied down and smacked Sangwan straight down the ground for a boundary. It wasn't a classical straight drive. It was a quintessential T20 smack. Next ball, he saw the off stump flying behind him from almost halfway down the pitch.Railways 241 all out vs Delhi 334/7 in 96 overs (Ayush Badoni 99, Pranav Rajvanshi 39, Sumit Mathur 78 not out; Himanshu Sangwan 2/46, Kunal Yadav 2/82)",Virat Kohli's offstump cartwheels after being bowled by Himanshu Sangwan.

He then claimed his first T20I wicket by dismissing Liam Livingstone, followed by Jacob Bethel's wicket.Phil Salt and Ben Duckett started strongly with a 62-run opening partnership in 36 balls but their dismissals shifted momentum towards India.Harry Brook's quick-fire 51 off 26 balls briefly revived England's chances, but his dismissal by Chakravarthy, who took another wicket in the same over, turned the match in India's favor.England's batting ten collapsed against India's spinners and Rana, with the team being dismissed in 19.4 overs.In the first innings, England's Saqib Mahmood, replacing Mark Wood, made an immediate impact by dismissing Sanju Samson for 12 with his first delivery.Mahmood then removed Tilak Varma and Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav for a duck, creating early pressure on India.Rinku Singh scored 30 and Abhishek Sharma contributed 29 runs in a counter-attacking partnership before Adil Rashid dismissed Abhishek.After Brydon Carse dismissed Rinku, Pandya and Dube, who survived an early drop by Jos Buttler, launched a strong counter-attack.Pandya's aggressive innings included four boundaries and four sixes in his 30-ball stay before Jamie Overton dismissed him.

Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane has criticised Marcus Rashford , stating that the forward ""must be ashamed"" of his current situation under manager Ruben Amorim .The 27-year-old has not played for United in seven weeks, and Amorim has made it clear that Rashford ""has to change"" if he wants to have a future at Old Trafford. Despite training with the squad ahead of Thursday's Europa League match against Romanian side FCSB, Rashford was left out of the traveling squad.With the transfer window closing at 23:00 GMT on Monday, Rashford has been linked with a potential loan move to Barcelona, but time is running out to finalize a deal.Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane expressed his frustration over Rashford’s situation:""I can't get involved in the conversation, I still can't understand at any level. Whatever's going on with players leaving, months left on contracts, a player who doesn't train properly... I don't understand it.You might as well leave me out of this conversation. Especially if you think he wants to move, which is more of a reason to train properly so when you go to a new club you're up to speed and when you leave the club at least you showed a decent attitude. He must be ashamed.""Fellow United legend Wayne Rooney also shared his thoughts, recalling a recent visit to United’s Carrington training facility :""I went into Carrington on Sunday to take my kids to game day, and Marcus Rashford was out on the training pitch with the fitness coach, but he was right over towards where the parents were walking past for the kids' games.I looked at him thinking how embarrassing it must be for him as parents walk past.""Rooney admitted he had spoken to Rashford and advised him to leave Manchester United in order to revive his career:""I've spoken to Marcus a couple of times and I've given him my thoughts and feelings that he needs to leave the football club because whatever is going on in his life and at Manchester United, he's not the same. For him to have a fresh start, he needs to leave the club.""A product of United’s youth academy, Rashford has scored 138 goals in 426 appearances for the club, including seven goals in 24 games this season. However, a potential move remains complicated due to his reported £300,000-a-week ($374,000) contract, which runs until 2028.",Marcus Rashford has not played for Manchester United in seven weeks.

After a frantic last round of action Wednesday, the inaugural 36-team league phase in UEFA Champions League history is over . Here's a look at some of the numbers that tell the story of how the first season in the new-look format has gone:144: The number of games in the 36-team league phase, up from 96 last year in the old 32-team group format.3.27: Goals per game in the new format, up from 3.09 per game in last season's group stage.9: Barcelona 's Robert Lewandowski and Borussia Dortmund's Serhou Guirassy are joint top scorers with nine goals each.28: The number of goals scored by Barcelona, six more than any other team in the league phase. Manchester City led the way last season with 28 goals in their entire Champions League campaign, including knockout games.7: Liverpool's winning streak stopped at seven games with a 3-2 loss at PSV Eindhoven. That loss meant there were no unbeaten teams in the league phase. Six teams qualified unbeaten from their groups last season.23: The number of games won by a margin of four goals or more. Bayern Munich's 9-2 win over Dinamo Zagreb on the opening night set the tone as one-sided games were more common. Last year only four group games were won by four goals or more. Having goal difference as the primary tiebreaker - unlike last year - gave stronger teams an incentive to run up the score.0: The number of teams from eastern Europe that reached the knockout rounds, despite the expanded format. Clubs from Croatia, Czech Republic, Serbia, Slovakia and Ukraine all finished outside the top 24. Zagreb was closest in 25th but missed out on goal difference despite upsetting AC Milan 2-1.

The seeded team, in most cases, will play the return leg at home.The potential opponents are pre-defined by how they fared in the eight-match league stage. For example, teams finishing ninth and tenth will face clubs that ended 23rd or 24th; teams finishing 11th or 12th will be drawn against either the 21st or 22nd-placed sides.Eventually, the eight clubs that prevail in the knockouts progress to the Round of 16.As already mentioned, the teams that finished between ninth and 24th in the league phase have found their way into this two-legged knockout phase play-off.

The second unseeded team from the pair is then drawn and placed in its corresponding spot on the blue side.This process continues with the other unseeded teams until all pairings are drawn and positioned on the bracket.Once the unseeded teams are set, the draw proceeds with the seeded teams, starting with those ranked 15th and 16th. The same procedure applies: the first team drawn goes to the silver side, and the second to the blue side.This method is repeated for the remaining pairings, ending with the teams ranked 9th and 10th to finalise the knockout round matchups.In principle, seeded clubs are scheduled to play the return leg at home.

Edited excerpts:

How do you do this balancing act of coaching club and country?

Everyone says the mentality of an Indian footballer is not the same as in other countries. Do you agree?

It's been five years for you in India, the longest time you have spent outside your home country. What has your experience been like?

Now that you are the coach of the national team, what changes do you want to implement?

In India, cricket is a religion, so how do you see football cross that barrier?

Manolo Marquez is the first foreigner to take up the dual role of coaching an Indian football club, FC Goa, and the national team. In a free-wheeling chat during Townhall With The Times of India, the Indian football team coach opens up on his first impressions of the country, adapting to the ""Indian way"" of getting things done, while discussing the way forward for the beautiful game.I didn't expect to share both jobs. The beginning was more difficult because the national team had games in Sept, Oct and Nov and FC Goa had a bad start. People talk, but I always say all this noise (and criticism) is why I get paid. About the dual role, it's not normal, but it's not the first time either.I always joke that one day I will write a book on India and the title will be 'The Indian Mentality'. There is a lot of talent, but they don't know how to show this talent. There is no consistency (in performances).When I arrived here, the players that were very good in the first season disappeared in the second. Players who were very bad in the previous season, did very good in the next. You need consistency. I miss this in Indian football.Looking at the chaos (during the Covid-19 pandemic) on the first day I arrived in Mumbai, I asked myself, 'what are you doing here?' Then I landed in Goa (to be inside the biosecure bubble for ISL ), got inside the car and was astonished with the driving. I told the driver, 'Wow, you can be an incredible winger, you surpassed cars, dogs, cows, people.' It was completely crazy. I wanted to leave after 10 minutes. It's my fifth season now. India is an incredible country.The national team, at this moment, is less important. You need to focus on the grassroots. There is Vision 2047 (by the AIFF ), but if you don't start work immediately (on the grassroots), it will be Vision 2097. You need to do something as soon as possible because the talent is there. If you see U-13, U-15, U-17 players in FC Goa, maybe you will be surprised. There are better, or the same, players here like in Spain.But the (development) process is completely different. Here the focus is on studies, and they cannot attend (regular) training sessions because they have exams constantly. Then there are (travel) distances. When people ask me when India will play at the World Cup, I tell them this is the last question (anyone should be asking). You need to start from the bottom.In my opinion, football will never surpass cricket in India. Never. But in a country of 1.4 billion, there is space for more than one sport. What I do hate is when I am told that ISL must finish before IPL starts. I know a million more people will watch IPL cricket than ISL, but that's okay, if (football) is the second sport. Keep going, don't change fixtures. This is something India needs to improve. Maybe I am from another culture, another mentality. Here, everything is organised at the last moment, and then it's changed. You need a proper schedule. Now I have learnt a lot to improvise. Do it the Indian way.","Manolo Marquez is the first foreigner to take up the dual role of coaching an Indian football club, FC Goa, and the national team.

NEW DELHI: Sasikumar Mukund is set to make a significant return to the Davis Cup as India prepare to face Togo in the World Group I Play-off starting Saturday.Once hailed as a promising talent by tennis legend Leander Paes, Mukund's career faced setbacks due to injuries and controversies, including an unannounced suspension following his Davis Cup debut in September 2023. Now 28 and primarily training in Austria, Mukund is eager to secure his first Davis Cup victory in the absence of Sumit Nagal India enter the tie as firm favorites against the lower-ranked Togo team. Mukund will commence the singles matches against Liova Ayite Ajavon, while Ramkumar Ramanathan is set to face Thomas Setodji, who holds an ATP ranking of 1256.Despite the apparent disparity in rankings, Mukund remains cautious, reflecting on past experiences:""Morocco was not an easy experience and hopefully tomorrow is the chance to redeem myself, and I can get to the finish line. It has been a while since I played in Morocco and I am much fitter and a better player now. I have put in a lot of hard work, in general.""Togo has demonstrated resilience, winning 10 of their last 11 ties, though they have yet to face higher-caliber teams like India. Indian captain Rohit Rajpal emphasizes the importance of not underestimating the opposition:""It's a format based on merit. India had reached the final without being a seeded team. If they have reached the Playoffs, it means they have played at a good level.""In doubles, debutant Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli , who recently entered the top 100 in doubles rankings and competed in the Australian Open, will partner with N.

NEW DELHI: Having played back-to-back Davis Cup away ties, the Indians are happy to be p laying their latest encounter at home. They hope to make the most of the home advantage when they play an untested Togo on the weekend.In 2022, they earned a promotion winning their home match against Denmark in the Capital before dropping down following a loss to Norway in the away game. They suffered another setback in 2023 losing the away encounter to Denmark before recovering with a win over Morocco in Lucknow. Last year too, they did well by beating Pakistan in Islamabad before again suffering reverses in another away tie against Sweden.""I think we played most of the ties away and somehow in Scandinavia, which was a joke amongst us. It looked like we're going to Scandinavia again this time too. So, from Finland (loss in 2021) to Sweden to Norway to Denmark, we've been everywhere,"" captain Rohit Rajpal said here on Thursday. ""We went and played in Pakistan too. So, we're really hoping that we get more ties (at home). You know, there's certainly an advantage when you play at home. There's no two ways about it.""Rajpal, a former Davis Cupper himself, said that despite being the higher-ranked team and having the home advantage, India are World No. 38 while Togo are No. 73, the hosts are not taking their rivals lightly. ""We could not get too much information about them online. So, we were waiting for them to show up here and will watch them carefully. They have beaten 10 teams on the trot and they are high on confidence,"" he said.""They're hitting the ball pretty good. We were a little surprised. They look quite talented as well. And a s far as chances are concerned, it's Davis Cup. We don't take anybody lightly. We've ourselves beaten some very, big and good teams. So that is part of Davis Cup. We are ready for everything, whatever comes our way.""Ramkumar Ramanathan added: ""We should just stick to our strengths and we should play to our capabilities and not think much about them. I think if we do that, we have a good chance.""India's top ranked player in this mix, Mukund Sasikumar , has a world ranking of 365. Ramkumar Ramanathan is world No. 406, Davis Cup debutant Karan Singh is 496. Sumit Nagal , who's not taking part in the tie, has the best ranking among the Indians at 102, having dropped out of top 100 recently. So it came as no surprise when Mukund said he's 'hurt' by the numbers. ""It hurts a little bit when I read or when I look at the numbers saying the No. 1 ranked player is 360. This depth is kind of disappointing because first I am an Indian tennis fan and then I am a player.

That was so because so many guys were much ahead of me. God willing that depth is coming soon again.""","India have played back-to-back Davis Cup away ties.

""We have a Delhi Open coming which will bring players from 25 to 30 countries. These Indian Davis Cup players will be there. We're working on making it into a property that keeps growing.

Novak Djokovic v Alexander Zverev Highlights | Australian Open 2025 Semifinal

Rafael Nadal's uncle and former coach has joined others in questioning Novak Djokovic 's hamstring injury that led to his withdrawal from the Australian Open semi-final. Toni Nadal , who coached Rafael for almost 30 years, also addressed the crowd's reaction to Djokovic 's retirement.In his column for El Pais , Toni Nadal expressed concerns about Djokovic's decision to retire against Alexander Zverev without attempting a medical timeout during the match.The crowd at Rod Laver Arena , who had paid over $400 for tickets, responded with boos and jeers when Djokovic retired from the match.""I believe that a great champion like the Serbian, someone who has contributed to the most sublime pages in the history of tennis, should not leave any court in this way and, even less so Rod Laver Arena, where he holds the record for victories and titles,"" Nadal wrote.""Respect ... is well deserved in the difficult moment, leaving the court that has seen him win so many times. I understand that the public showed their disappointment and anger at being deprived of the expected spectacle after having paid an entrance fee for it.""Toni Nadal suggested that Djokovic's history of playing through injuries has been marked by theatrical displays.""Over the years, a certain suspicion has been fostered around Novak, due to his grimaces or histrionics, which has sown doubts about the veracity of his injuries,"" he stated.""Suspicions began in his quarter-final match against Carlos Alcaraz. After losing the first set, and with obvious gestures of pain, the Serbian made it clear to his opponent and the general public he would hardly be able to continue his match. But the reality was he not only faced the rest of the match with total normality, but he even ended up winning it. Against Zverev, he played the entire first set with apparent normality and without visible signs of pain until he decided to abandon it just after the German won the first set.""Following the match, Djokovic explained that he was ""upset"" about his worsening hamstring tear . He mentioned trying everything possible to manage the pain.Djokovic later shared an MRI image of his injured hamstring on social media to address skepticism about his condition.""When a player faces physical problems in a match of this nature, he normally waits until the end to decide to retire,"" Toni Nadal continued. ""He calls the physiotherapist, plays some games impaired and, only when he sees the inevitable fate, does he decide to retire. On more than one occasion we have seen Novak with similar performances, with facial gestures and body language that contradict what we are seeing on the court, and that sow certain doubts about the authenticity of his problems.""Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley had revealed in 2023 that Djokovic had won his tenth Melbourne Park title while dealing with a 3cm hamstring tear. However, athletes and medical experts disputed this claim.Toni Nadal's coaching career includes guiding Rafael to numerous major victories, including 10 Roland-Garros titles, one Australian Open, two Wimbledon championships, three US Open titles, and an Olympic gold medal. Their partnership lasted until 2017. He later spent three years coaching Canadian player Félix Auger-Aliassime.","Novak Djokovic retired mid-way into his Australian Open 2025 semi-final match with injury.

"Togo out to earn respect, upset applecart in Davis Cup tie vs India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/togo-out-to-earn-respect-upset-applecart-in-davis-cup-tie-vs-india/articleshow/117666112.cms,"STAR SHOW: Togo's Davis Cup captain Ali Agnamba (left) with Togolese football legend Emmanuel Adebayor (centre) during a game of tennis at the latter's residence in Dec 2024

NEW DELHI: For tennis aficionados, the name Togo might not ring a bell. Few would bet on them to trouble India in the Davis Cup 2025 World Group Playoff match here on the weekend. But for their captain Ali Agnamba , who believes his team is in the middle of the best phase in two decades, it would be anything but a cakewalk. Agnamba has a point.Togo have reached this position the back of a 10-match winning streak - achieved by a group of young players who play their tennis abroad. It may sound a bit fanciful when he suggested that his team could beat India, but then he threw up numbers to support his belief.""When we played against Latvia in the last match, nobody expected us to win,"" he said referring to the World No.73 Togo's Davis Cup tie against World No. 46 Latvia. ""Even back home, people thought this was going to be the end. But the guys came together, they were like 'Oh, we want to win this. We're going to win'. And we surprised a lot of people. Even the Latvia players were surprised when we beat them 4-0.""India are ranked eight places above Latvia - at 38.The captain, a former Togolese Davis Cupper himself who migrated to the US years back and was in the coaching team that worked with the Williams sisters in their formative years, draws his confidence from the ability of the four-member team at his disposal. His team of players are based around the world and have been specially assembled for this journey - two from Paris, one from Nantes and the other from Atlanta, USA - not just to earn glory, but respect too.""The Williams sisters changed women tennis. If you have a female tennis player doing what they're doing now, is because of them. Because before, nobody had to go to the gym to get strong. Those girls came, they're so powerful that they force everybody to do a lot more,"" he said.They also changed mindset on race, reminded Agnamba. ""You know, when you're a person of colour, you're already 10 steps below before you can come up. You have to be the best of the best to get respect. Even that sometimes you may not.""Togo would be looking to inspire some of that respect over the weekend. ""Obviously we have four players here that all live in different parts of the world, but we have a way to communicate together through chat. And when there's a competition like this, we kind of figure out how each player can get ready individually, either by training or going to competition. And that's how the team has been performing for the past three years,"" said Agnamba, who admitted having a culture shock when he shifted base to the US 30 years back.In a bid to escape poverty and being able to pursue the sport, the players had to leave Togo seeking greener pastures abroad, but their loyalty remains firmly with the western African country. So, in the match against India, the objective was not just to have a better show in Davis Cup, but to inspire several others back home struggling to make ends meet. Tennis is the second-most followed sport in Togo, behind football.""When you grow up in developing countries, the opportunity is very small. And when you are good at any type of sport, I mean, since we're talking about tennis and the dream is always to get out of the country because once you get out, you have more opportunity to train, you have better equipment. And yeah, that's always been a dream to get out of the country, to have more opportunity.""So, the average kid that plays tennis back home, they're coming from very poor families, and you cannot be your best in Africa. You must get up. And I think for any African country that played in the Davis Cup, 90% of the players live overseas. In developing countries there are a lot of poor kids that use sport as a way to get out of the country to have a better life. And I'll tell you, 99% of the players that are able to compete for Togo come from very poor families. But the system that we have there, the federation helps the best players.""",Togo face India in the Davis Cup 2025 World Group Playoff match on the weekend.

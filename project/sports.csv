India's aura of invincibility at home has begun to show worrying cracks. Since 2020, the team has played 25 home Tests and still boasts a strong overall record — 16 wins, seven defeats and two draws, a respectable 64% win rate. But numbers in isolation hide the alarming trend that has gripped Indian cricket: rapid collapses on spin-friendly surfaces and a stunning rise in three-day defeats, a scenario once associated only with visiting sides.The rot got exposed during the 0–3 debacle against New Zealand last year — India's first clean sweep at home in a Test series of three or more matches and their first home whitewash since South Africa's 2–0 triumph in 2000. While a 2–0 sweep of West Indies earlier this year briefly offered hope of a revival, the crushing loss to South Africa at Eden Gardens has dragged India back into a spiral.Despite winning seven of their eight home series since 2020, the defeats have been telling. Alarmingly, four of India's seven losses at home in this period have come inside three days, highlighting the growing vulnerability of their batters against high-quality spin on rank turners — conditions they once dominated.India's win percentage remains high, but the recent slide is undeniable. Before the New Zealand series, this win percentage was significantly stronger.India's four three-day defeats at home in this decade follow a similar pattern — batting collapses against opposition spinners who exploited surfaces India prepared for their own advantage.India were blown away for 109 in the first innings as Matthew Kuhnemann and Nathan Lyon ran riot. Lyon's eight-for in the second innings sealed a nine-wicket win for Australia inside three days.A year later, Mitchell Santner delivered match figures of 13 wickets in Pune, handing India a 113-run defeat. A week later, Ajaz Patel (11 wickets) dismantled India again in Mumbai, helping New Zealand clinch the series 3–0 — their first sweep in India.At Eden Gardens, India seemed in control after bowling South Africa out for 159. But their batters managed only a 30-run lead. Chasing 124, India folded for 93 as Simon Harmer (8 wickets) spun through the line-up. The loss gave South Africa their first Test win in India in 15 years.India have not only lost rapidly — they have also won rapidly. Half of their home victories (8 of 16) have come inside three days, with one even finishing in two days.This reversal — the same conditions helping opponents as much as India — marks a shift in the balance of power on Indian pitches.India's traditional strength — batting against spin — has eroded sharply. Where previous generations thrived on turners, the current line-up has repeatedly succumbed to disciplined, patient spin bowling.The core issue is not pitch preparation, which historically benefited India, but the inability of the batters to build partnerships and grind out runs under pressure. Even home spinners have delivered match-winning figures, but the batting failures have negated those efforts.After the Kolkata collapse, a rank turner is unlikely in the next Test at Guwahati, which hosts its first-ever Test on November 22.India's limited-overs record at the venue is mixed:With no historical Test data and a venue known for batting-friendly white-ball conditions, Guwahati could offer relief to India's struggling batting unit.But whether the surface helps them reset — or exposes deeper flaws — will be the next big question.","India's aura of invincibility at home has begun to show worrying cracks.

Punam Raut exclusive interview: Ex-cricketer breaks down after Harmanpreet Kaur's historic win

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh women’s cricket captain Nigar Sultana Joty has broken her silence on allegations that she physically assaulted junior players in the national team — flatly denying the claims while taking a dramatic swipe at India’s World Cup-winning captain Harmanpreet Kaur The controversy erupted after former Bangladesh pacer Jahanara Alam , currently residing in Australia, alleged that several junior cricketers had contacted her, saying that Sultana had “hit” and “mistreated” them. The Bangladesh captain, however, dismissed the accusation as baseless and questioned why such complaints would be directed to someone who has been away from the team setup for years.In an interview with Daily Cricket, Sultana not only defended herself but also invoked Harmanpreet’s controversial behaviour during India’s 2023 tour of Bangladesh. The Indian captain had smashed the stumps after an LBW decision and later labelled the umpiring “pathetic” in the post-match presentation — an episode that created international headlines.“Why would I hit anyone? I mean, why would I strike the stumps with my bat? Am I Harmanpreet, that I would go around hitting the stumps like that? Why would I do it?” Sultana said, making her denial both pointed and provocative.“In my personal space, if I’m cooking or something, I might bang my bat around, I might hit my helmet—that’s my own business.But why would I do something like that to someone else? Why would I get physical? Just because someone says so? You can ask the other players or anyone else whether I’ve ever done anything like that.”Alam had earlier claimed that juniors reached out to her from Bangladesh, saying: “Please save us, Joty apu is beating us and finishing us off.” But Sultana questioned the logic behind such allegations.“The way I’ve been described in front of everyone—I’m not that kind of girl at all,” she said. “If I really beat someone or harmed someone in any way, is there no team management, no manager, no coaching staff? Am I the ultimate authority then? Why would a player call someone living in Australia? She could’ve shared it with anyone here.”Sultana recently led Bangladesh in the 2025 Women’s World Cup, where the side managed only one win, defeating Pakistan. The allegations have added an unexpected layer of turbulence to Bangladesh women’s cricket, but the captain remains firm: she insists she has never laid a hand on any teammate.","Bangladesh captain Nigar Sultana Joty vehemently denies allegations of physically assaulting junior players.

Some stakeholders advocate for returning to the traditional home-and-away format throughout the tournament and reducing its frequency.""They've got to do something (with) this event, because I think playing every year, I mean — it is not as good as it might be if you're playing every two or three years.

I think this is Davis Cup, you know?""Pierre-Hugues Herbert, a French player who won the 2017 Davis Cup in Lille, shares similar sentiments about hosting matches in participating nations.""The new format has been a bit challenging for us in France, I think, especially for me, because I felt like something a bit died in this competition,"" he added.The tournament opens with third-seeded France facing Belgium on Tuesday.Top-seeded Italy, featuring Flavio Cobolli, Lorenzo Sonego, and Matteo Berrettini, will compete against Austria on Wednesday.Thursday's quarterfinals include second-seeded Germany, led by Alexander Zverev, against Argentina.The semifinals are scheduled for Friday and Saturday, with the championship match on Sunday.Spain face a formidable challenge against the Czech team, which includes top-20 players Jiri Lehecka and Jakub Mensik, who previously eliminated the United States in September's qualifying round.","The Davis Cup Final 8 begins in Bologna, Italy.

'When you don't play well, this is what happens': Gautam Gambhir reacts to 1st Test defeat, points out what India lacked

Poll Do you think the Eden Gardens pitch was responsible for India's defeat against South Africa? Yes, it affected their performance No, the team lost due to their own mistakes





NEW DELHI: The Eden Gardens pitch has become the centre of a heated debate after India’s first Test against South Africa ended within three days, exposing deep divisions among cricketing greats and raising fresh questions about India’s struggles on turning tracks.Head coach Gautam Gambhir strongly defended the surface, rejecting suggestions that the pitch was responsible for India’s 30-run defeat. “This is exactly the pitch we wanted and the curator was very helpful. There was nothing wrong with the pitch. We couldn’t handle the pressure of the fourth-innings’ chase and we need to improve,” Gambhir said.He doubled down, insisting the conditions were fair. “There were no demons in this wicket. It was not unplayable… The majority of wickets have gone to seamers. This was a surface where your technique and mental toughness were tested. If you had the temperament to grind and bat long, you could score runs.”However, two giants of the game challenged Gambhir’s assessment. Former India captain Anil Kumble, speaking to host broadcaster JioStar, delivered a blunt verdict: “I have been coming to Kolkata for a long time and I have never seen a pitch like this at the Eden Gardens.”Dale Steyn was even sharper in his criticism. “There were definitely demons in the pitch. The batters couldn’t trust their defence… Even set batters like Temba Bavuma and Washington Sundar knew the next ball could have their name on it,” the former South Africa pacer said.The contrasting views come as India grapple with declining home dominance. Last year, India suffered a 0-3 defeat to New Zealand on similarly spin-friendly surfaces — their first home series loss since 2012 — triggering a transition marked by the retirements of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and R Ashwin.India have now lost four of their last six home Tests and must win in Guwahati to keep the series alive.South Africa’s win — their first Test victory in India in 15 years — was built on a disciplined bowling display as India folded for 93 while chasing 124. Simon Harmer (4-21), Keshav Maharaj (2-37) and Marco Jansen (2-15) dismantled the hosts on a treacherous surface, completing a rare three-day victory.India were also hampered by the loss of captain Shubman Gill, who was hospitalised with a neck spasm and ruled out mid-match, leaving the team a batter short.The second Test begins on November 22 in Guwahati, with India facing mounting pressure — and a growing pitch debate.",South Africa beat India by 30 runs in first Test at Eden Gardens.

Kolkata Police on Sunday arrested three youths for allegedly running an illegal betting racket from inside the Eden Gardens during the India–South Africa Test match, officials said.The accused have been identified as Altaf Khan, Ankush Raj and Patel Pinkal Kumar, residents of Maharashtra, Bihar and Gujarat. According to an IANS report quoting police officials, the trio had travelled to Kolkata specifically to operate the betting operation during the high-profile Test.The match, which ended inside three days, was unfolding on the field even as police were tracking suspicious activity in the stands. On Saturday, the second day of play, officers received confidential information about spectators allegedly placing and accepting bets via mobile phones inside the stadium.Acting on the tip-off, a joint team from the Anti-Rowdy Squad and the Intelligence Department conducted a discreet raid at the venue. Police zeroed in on the ‘F1’ block of the Eden Gardens gallery, where the three suspects were detained.During the search, officers recovered multiple phones being used to run betting operations.Police sources said the gang was using apps such as BR365, R777 and 1xbook, and several screenshots of suspicious transactions were found on the devices.Investigators believe the trio may be part of a larger network that moves between cities during major cricket matches to run similar betting setups. Although three arrests have been made, officials suspect more individuals could be involved.Following questioning, police registered an FIR at the Maidan Police Station and continued to analyse digital evidence to uncover the full extent of the racket.","Three youths arrested for allegedly running an illegal betting racket from inside the Eden Gardens during the India–South Africa Test match.

Bumrah and Bavuma after the match

Poll Should Bumrah and Rishabh Pant have been more cautious with their remarks during the match? Yes, it has wider repercussions No, it's all in good fun





A difficult three-day defeat for India ended with an unexpected moment of composure, as Jasprit Bumrah and Temba Bavuma were seen in a light-hearted conversation after the hosts were dismissed for 93 while chasing 124 at Eden Gardens. Bumrah , left unbeaten at the end, walked towards the South Africa captain after Mohammed Siraj fell. Images of the two speaking animatedly as they made their way out of the pitch went viral within minutes, becoming one of the biggest talking points after India’s 30-run loss.The exchange drew attention because of the controversy that had clouded Day 1. During South Africa’s first innings, stump audio captured Bumrah and Rishabh Pant allegedly using the word “bauna” during a chat over a possible lbw review against Bavuma.The remark was widely circulated online, even though India did not pursue the review and replays showed the ball would have gone over. Bavuma was later dismissed for 11 by Kuldeep Yadav.South Africa’s batting coach had said at the end of Day 1 that the visitors would “not take this matter further” and that it would not affect the series. With the post-match scenes on Day 3 showing both players in discussion, the perception was that the incident had been put aside as the match moved on.On the field, South Africa sealed their first Test win in India in 15 years, defending 124 on a surface that challenged every batter. Simon Harmer’s 4/21 led the attack, supported by Marco Jansen, Aiden Markram and Keshav Maharaj.India, without captain Shubman Gill due to a neck injury, had brief resistance through Washington Sundar’s 31 and Axar Patel’s late hitting, but the innings never recovered once Harmer broke the Sundar-Jurel stand.Bavuma’s unbeaten 55 earlier in the day lifted South Africa to 153, pushing the lead to 123.Ravindra Jadeja finished with 4/50, and Siraj delivered a short burst, but the pressure mounted once India slipped early in the chase.India’s home run had already ended unsteadily last season, and this defeat leaves them needing a win in Guwahati to avoid a second Test series loss at home under Gautam Gambhir.The short turnaround gives little time for reflection, but the conversation between Bumrah and Bavuma suggested both teams are focusing on the cricket alone before the second Test.","Jasprit Bumrah and Temba Bavuma engaged in a lively chat after the Proteas took a 1-0 lead in Kolkata.

Mohsin Naqvi Cornered At ICC Meet In Dubai; Asia Cup Trophy Dispute Turns Into Diplomatic Face-Off

A controversial moment unfolded during the India A versus Pakistan Shaheens match in the Asia Cup Rising Stars tournament on Sunday. The incident involved a relay catch between Nehal Wadhera and Naman Dhir that was ultimately ruled not out by the third umpire.India A had set a modest target of 137 runs after experiencing a significant batting collapse.Pakistan A opener Maaz Sadaqat was dominating the chase with an impressive 31-ball fifty. The turning point occurred on the first ball of the 10th over when Suyash Sharma induced a lofted shot from Sadaqat towards deep field.The controversial play began when Nehal Wadhera chased the shot to the boundary. While airborne outside the rope, he managed to flick the ball back into play, and Naman Dhir completed what appeared to be a valid relay catch inside the field.Maaz Sadaqat had already started walking back, assuming he was dismissed. However, the on-field umpires asked him to wait for the third umpire's decision.The decision displayed as ""Not out"" on the screen left the Indian players stunned. Captain Jitesh Sharma immediately sought clarification from the officials regarding the ruling.Watch:The decision was based on a significant boundary fielding rule change announced by the MCC in June 2025.The amendment to Law 19.5.2 addressed confusion around airborne relay attempts and multiple touches outside the field of play.The previous rule only considered the first fielder's position and grounding. This allowed multiple airborne relay touches outside the boundary.The updated law now requires all fielders who touch the ball to meet specific grounding requirements. A fielder can touch the ball once while airborne outside the boundary but must land inside the field and remain there until the ball becomes dead.According to Sub-Clause 19.5.2.1, when a fielder touches the ball while airborne outside the rope and then lands outside, the ball is automatically considered a boundary.In this case, because Wadhera’s first contact after touching the ball occurred outside the boundary line, the dismissal was disallowed.The controversy deepened when neither a six nor a single run was awarded to Pakistan Shaheens on the delivery, as no batters crossed the crease.Taking advantage of this fortunate decision, Sadaqat guided Pakistan Shaheens to a convincing eight-wicket victory. This win secured Pakistan Shaheens a place in the semi-final.",Controversial moment unfolded during the India A versus Pakistan Shaheens match.

'When you don't play well, this is what happens': Gautam Gambhir reacts to 1st Test defeat, points out what India lacked

Poll Do you think Shubman Gill should sit out the second Test to recover fully? Yes, recovery is more important. No, he should play if fit.





India captain Shubman Gill was discharged from a Kolkata hospital on Sunday after a neck injury forced him out of the first Test against South Africa and left the hosts severely depleted in a 30-run defeat at Eden Gardens. Gill, who retired hurt after facing only three balls on Day 2, was diagnosed with a severe neck spasm and ruled out before the start of the third day's play. His absence in the second innings proved costly as India folded for just 93, conceding a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.Cricket Association of Bengal president Sourav Ganguly visited Gill at the Woodlands Multispeciality Hospital soon after the defeat, confirming the opener was stable but still under observation. While he has now been discharged, Gill's availability for the second Test in Guwahati, beginning November 22, remains uncertain. As per reports, doctors have advised him to avoid commercial air travel during recovery, making it unlikely he will join the squad on their Wednesday flight. He is also expected to miss India's final training session in Kolkata on Tuesday.Head coach Gautam Gambhir admitted Gill's absence deeply affected India's chase. “It was tough because we always knew we were one down,” Gambhir said.“Losing two before lunch meant we were literally three down. A couple of partnerships could have put us in the game.”If Gill fails to recover in time, India may turn to B Sai Sudharsan or Devdutt Padikkal. Sudharsan had impressed earlier against the West Indies but struggled for India A recently, while Padikkal's recent returns were modest. Any such change would leave India heavily stacked with left-handers — a concern after South Africa offspinner Simon Harmer dismissed six southpaws in the match.Gill's injury comes amid an intense workload phase, following months of continuous cricket across formats. He had previously missed a Test in October 2024 due to a similar neck issue.Meanwhile, Ganguly weighed in on Eden Gardens' spin-heavy surface, calling it “not the best Test wicket” but insisting India should still have overhauled the modest 124-run target. He also urged the team to return to grinding out victories over five days instead of relying on sharply turning tracks.The loss, India's fourth at home in six Tests, has once again raised uncomfortable questions about the batting group's struggles on rank turners — with Gill's fitness now the biggest concern heading into Guwahati.","Shubman Gill has been discharged from a Kolkata hospital.

'When you don't play well, this is what happens': Gautam Gambhir reacts to 1st Test defeat, points out what India lacked

Former Indian cricket captain Sunil Gavaskar criticised the Indian batting performance after their 30-run defeat against South Africa in the first Test match at Eden Gardens, Kolkata.India failed to chase a target of 124 runs, giving South Africa a 1-0 lead in the two-Test Freedom Trophy series. The team played with 10 batters as captain Shubman Gill had to leave the field due to neck issues.Gavaskar pointed out that the lack of domestic cricket participation was the main reason behind India's batting collapse.""A lot of our players do not play domestic cricket. If you play domestic cricket, you will get to play on such pitches, right? Because even at the domestic level, teams are trying to get the points so that they qualify for the knockouts of the Ranji Trophy , which means that there will be pitches where the ball will grip and turn a little bit,"" the batting legend told Sports Tak.""But none of our players are playing that. None of our current players. How many of our current players actually deign to go down and play Ranji Trophy?""The legendary cricketer expressed concern about players avoiding domestic cricket, citing workload management. He suggested that team management should consider selecting players who actively participate in Ranji Trophy matches.""No, they don't because there's this word called workload.Workload is the word. They don't want to play. They don't want to play. They only want to play in the Ranji Trophy if they are out of form. Otherwise, they don't want to play. So that is the answer. Maybe you want to look at, you know, preparing a pitch where the ball will grip and turn a little bit. Then you want to pick guys who are playing domestic cricket. We do not really want to play guys who are playing international cricket because they don't have the practice against such kind,"" he added.The second Test of the series will be crucial for India as they look to level the series after their disappointing performance in Kolkata.The team's batting collapse in their pursuit of a modest target has raised concerns about their ability to handle challenging pitch conditions.Gavaskar's comments highlight the growing disconnect between domestic and international cricket in India, where established players often skip Ranji Trophy matches.The emphasis on workload management has become a contentious issue, with senior players frequently opting out of domestic cricket commitments.","India lost the first Test against South Africa by 30 runs in Kolkata.

SCOREBOARD

HUBBALLI: If R Smaran encapsulates the future of Karnataka cricket, then it is in very good hands. The southpaw scored his second double century of the season, celebrated it with a mere raise of the bat and, without much ado, got on with the task of trying to bat Chandigarh out of the Ranji Trophy contest here.The muted celebration was usual. What was not was his gesture just before taking his guard again. He laid his helmet on the ground and waved to the Karnataka dressing room.Asked what it was all about, Smaran simply said, “It’s something Karun Nair and Nikin Jose asked me to do when I scored a century. I didn’t do it when I got my 100, so I made up for it on reaching the 200-run mark. I haven’t asked them why I was asked to do it.”That’s Smaran — focused on what he has to do or is asked to do.On Monday, the second day of the contest, the 22-year-old notched up a career best unbeaten 227 (262b; 16x4; 1x6) to steer the home side to a mammoth 547/8 in 160 overs before they declared. This was Smaran's third double hundred in 13 First Class matches, with his previous one, an unbeaten 220, coming against Kerala earlier this month.In reply, Chandigarh had slipped to 72/4 in 17.4 overs when stumps were drawn — still a staggering 475 runs in deficit.Karnataka began the day at 298/5 with Smaran on 110 and Shreyas Gopal on 38. The intent was clear from the start as runs flowed freely. That Chandigarh’s bowling was uninspiring helped the home side.The sixth wicket partnership of 141 was finally broken by Vishu Kashyap when he trapped Shreyas (62) in front while the all-rounder attempted a sweep.Vidhyadhar Patil (30) continued from where Shreyas left off. At the other end, Smaran, an adept player of spin, was unstoppable. Chandigarh could only hope for a mistake from the lanky youngster, but that didn’t happen.Smaran kept it simple, waiting patiently for Vidhyadhar to rotate strike. He found the gaps easily with groundstrokes and flicks, but didn’t hesitate to step out against Kashyap and send the ball beyond the Karnataka dressing room for the second maximum of his innings.The partnership was halted when Jagjit Singh Sandhu bowled Vidhyadhar. Still, there was no respite for the visitors as rookie Shikhar Shetty (59) brought up his maiden First-Class half-century before offering Kashyap a return catch.Karnataka declared a while after tea, and Chandigarh began their reply at a brisk pace with openers Shivam Bhambri (16) and Arjun Azad (32) stepping out to almost every delivery.Their strategy quickly unravelled when Shreyas (3/18) and Mohsin Khan (1/23) were introduced. The parade to the pavilion began in the ninth over when Azad missed a paddle-sweep off Shreyas and had his leg stump pegged back.Karnataka will now work towards an innings victory.Karnataka (I innings; o/n: 298/5): R Smaran (not out) 227, Shreyas Gopal lbw Kashyap 62, Vidhyadhar Patil b Sandhu 30, Shikhar Shetty c & b 59, Mohsin Khan (not out) 5.

Why Andre Russell will remain hot property at the IPL mini auction

NEW DELHI: Former India leg-spinner Amit Mishra has described the trade involving veteran pacer Mohammed Shami — from Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) to Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) — on IPL 2026 retention day as a surprising development.He also termed Kolkata Knight Riders’ (KKR) call to release West Indies star Andre Russell into the auction pool as a “very risky” decision, just days before the December 16 auction in Abu Dhabi.Shami, bought by SRH for INR 10 crore at the last mega auction in Jeddah, endured a below-par IPL 2025 campaign, managing only six wickets at an average of 56.17 and an economy rate of 11.23 — a steep drop compared to his career IPL numbers of 28.19 and 8.63.""I think it was of Shami – he's a wicket-taker for any team, especially in Hyderabad. Good wickets are there and you need a wicket-taker. In terms of releases, Andre Russell was also surprising as releasing him into the auction is a very risky move, as no one can say whether he will go for a cheaper price or not.""""These two developments surprised me as Hyderabad has a wicket where you need a wicket-taker who can bowl under pressure.Hyderabad's wickets produce around 250-250 runs. You need a bowler (like Shami) who can get you a wicket at the start, put a yorker or bouncer in pressure time. All teams will need an all-rounder, like Andre Russell, in the auction. Teams will especially need either a fast bowler or an all-rounder, as they are in most demand always,"" said Mishra.Shami has played 64 Tests, 108 ODIs and 25 T20Is for India and was a member of the 2025 Champions Trophy winning team in the UAE. At LSG, Shami will reunite with bowling coach Bharat Arun, who was in the Indian team in the same role from 2014-2021. In those years, under Arun’s guidance, Shami evolved to become an indispensable part of the highly successful Indian fast bowling line-up.Mishra also felt Shami's wicket-taking abilities in the powerplay overs can come handy on pitches during LSG’s home games at the BRSABV Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow. ""The only reason Lucknow got Mohammed Shami on board is that he's a wicket-taking bowler. It will be very good if Shami picks wickets early as he has a very good skills to do so.”“He can bowl good yorkers and if the ball reverses, he can bowl good yorkers and bouncers. Basically, he's a wicket-taker and Lucknow must have felt the need to get one fast bowler who can take wickets in the starting overs, and Shami has that ability to do it,"" he said.Mishra also praised LSG's decision to retain young speedster Mayank Yadav despite recurring injury concerns, including undergoing a back surgery earlier this year in Christchurch, New Zealand. Mishra, who was in the LSG set-up when Yadav was there for 2023 and 2024 seasons, stressed that fitness management would be crucial for keeping Yadav fit for a longer period.""Regarding Mayank Yadav, he's young and the most important thing will be his fitness after return. When I was in the Lucknow team for two years, he played 1-2 games, and then got injured. After playing 1-2 more games, he was injured again. Now with the team keeping him and showing their trust in him, he should take it positively and fully focus on his fitness.""""He should try not to get injured whenever he comes on the field. Along with that, his load management and everything else will be taken care of. I will praise Lucknow for keeping him even after his injury. He's a talented bowler and will stay with them for the next 3-4 years,"" he said.Quizzed on LSG’s decision to release leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi, who had a below-par IPL 2025 after being retained for INR 11 crore, Mishra suggested it could be a calculated financial move to reacquire him at a lower price in the auction.""This is a good thing. If they want him back, then they could bring him for a cheaper price in the auction and save some money. I am sure they will go for him because it will be in their mind to get Bishnoi, but at a cheaper cost. At the same time, they will try to save some money and go for other players who can help them in the upcoming season,"" he said.On the broader trend of franchises releasing a few high-profile players, Mishra noted this strategy has become increasingly common in recent years. ""That started 2-3 years back. The reason is that the players who are expensive and were let go of in the auction, teams will try to get them back at a cheaper price.”“Many players don't perform, so you should have an option to get a replacement for a player who was not in form in the IPL. For players like Andre Russell, we all know that teams will try to get them at a cheaper price, or even get their replacements,"" he said.When asked which franchises could dominate the upcoming mini auction, Mishra pointed to financial muscle of sides like KKR and Chennai Super Kings, who have an auction purse of INR 64.3 crore and INR 43.4 crore respectively."" Mostly, the core team is always strong. The teams that have more money will dominate in the auction. They have options and the ability to force the other teams to spend more money on a player. You can't say which team will dominate in the auction, as sometimes you don't get what you really want. You then have to look for options. And the team that has more money has more options,"" he said.Looking ahead to his own involvement in IPL 2026, after ending his playing career earlier this year with 166 scalps in 154 games, including the most hat-tricks by a bowler in the tournament’s history, Mishra signed off by expressing interest in talent identification and nurturing spin bowling talent.""I am open to everything, but I would like to identify some players who can play for India and also perform in the IPL to become an option for the Indian team. I would like to pick 4-5 spinners who could play for India. I can go to the domestic level and if I get a chance, I would like to ready some players for the IPL, especially spinners.”""We didn't have so many options at that time and now that we do have, I would like to say that players don't get time to think due to so much cricket happening around. Like, I would talk to them about their skills and mindset. I would like to say that their thoughts should be clear and they should know what is bowling in T20s, one-days and Tests. Whenever I get a chance, I am ready to do it.""","Former India leg-spinner Amit Mishra has described the trade involving veteran pacer Mohammed Shami as a surprising development. He also termed Kolkata Knight Riders’ (KKR) call to release West Indies star Andre Russell into the auction pool as a “very risky’ decision.

NEW DELHI: Former India batter Cheteshwar Pujara dismissed suggestions that India’s heavy defeat to South Africa in the first Test at Eden Gardens was due to a transition phase. He said that while rebuilding struggles overseas may be acceptable, losing at home — especially with a squad packed with proven first-class performers — cannot be excused.Highlighting talents like Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul , Washington Sundar and Shubman Gill, Pujara stressed that India have enough quality to succeed in the longest format.""I don't agree with the view that India's defeat at home can be attributed to a transitional phase.

'When you don't play well, this is what happens': Gautam Gambhir reacts to 1st Test defeat, points out what India lacked

Former India batter Mohammed Kaif said that uncertainty over selection has slowed the development of India’s Test batters in home conditions under the current team management led by Gautam Gambhir.On Sunday, India’s batting unit struggled on a deteriorating Eden Gardens surface in Kolkata during the first Test against South Africa, which they lost by 30 runs. India selected four spinners — including three all-rounders, Washington Sundar, Ravindra Jadeja, and Axar Patel — and left out specialist No. 3 batter Sai Sudharsan. Sundar batted at No. 3 and showed resistance, but Kaif pointed to instability in selection.Referring to the situation of Sarfaraz Khan, who has slipped out of the team’s plans, Kaif said on his YouTube channel: ""Whichever players are playing, they don’t have a feeling that someone is standing for them. Koi backing nahi hai, sab darr ke khel rahe hain. (There is no backing; everyone is playing with fear.) Sab dar ke khel rahe hain, koi khul ke nahi khel raha (Everyone is playing in fear, nobody is playing with freedom).""If Sarfaraz Khan’s place is not confirmed after 100 scoring a hundred. Even after scoring 100, he’s not able to make a comeback. Sai Sudharsan scored 87. He doesn’t play the next Test match. I think there is a lot of confusion in this team.""Kaif’s comments came after India’s defeat in the first Test, where they fell short while chasing 124 and were bowled out for 93.The Eden Gardens pitch had uneven bounce and turn from the first day. Neither side crossed 200 in any innings, with bowlers dominating throughout. India had asked for a spin-friendly pitch, but the dry surface made the final-innings chase difficult.

Norway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 after a 4-1 win over Italy on Sunday, with Erling Haaland scoring twice to confirm their place in next summer’s tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Haaland scored both of his goals within seconds at San Siro, as Norway finished Group I with 24 points from eight matches.Before the match, Norway would have needed to lose by nine goals or more for Italy to overtake them for the group’s only automatic World Cup spot. Instead, Stale Solbakken’s team ended their campaign with a win in front of 70,000 spectators.Solbakken did not make any predictions about Norway’s chances at the World Cup.""Let's see the draw first... I haven't even thought about it. For me, it (tonight) was to go from 99 percent to 100 percent and now we have done it in a great way,"" Solbakken told reporters, as quoted by news agency AFP.""Let's see what the draw brings before we go into those questions.""Haaland’s father Alf-Inge was still an international player when Norway last played in a World Cup 27 years ago, a tournament won by France.Solbakken described Haaland as a ""goal machine"".

Kolkata : If Diego Maradona didn’t exist, could the football world be able get a Lothar Matthaus? Or vice versa? Sometimes, some friendships are born of a rivalry, unexpectedly but eventually as a necessity to thrive on each other’s exploits before becoming part of football folklore.Matthaus — assigned to man-mark Maradona in the 1986 World Cup final in Mexico — ended up seeing his Argentine rival lift the game’s biggest crown on the way to establishing his legend. Four years later in Italy, the German defender — now captaining his side — turned the table spectacularly, earning his spurs and denying the Argentine his second successive shot at glory.“Diego was the best footballer in my time. We were like Messi and Ronaldo. (But) they are not talking to each other. They don’t make parties together after the game. But Diego and me — we had many private moments and we made parties after the game too,” Matthaus — here in the city as official ambassador of the upcoming Bengal Super League — said on Sunday.“During the game, we had fights. We didn’t know each other like friends. I think we profited from each other. And in the end, Diego made me bigger and I made him bigger,” reminisced Matthaus, who won the Ballon d’Or after winning the 1990 World Cup.It was perhaps his adoration for Maradona the entertainer that might have prompted the German to become a fan of Lionel Messi in contemporary football. “I don’t like to say that Messi is better than (Cristiano) Ronaldo. It’s very difficult because they are different kinds of players. Ronaldo is more about the power and physicality. Messi is more like the smartest guy, (he’s) more about the entertainment. I am a fan of Messi because of his style of football,” he explained his point of view.Germany’s recent struggle to live up to expectations was also a concern for him. “This is not what we expect from the national team,” he quipped in disappointment, in reference to their elimination from the group stage itself in 2018 and 2022. So, what is missing in Die Mannschaft? “Passion,” pat came the reply.","Lothar Matthaus was assigned to man-mark Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup final in Mexico.

England capped a record-breaking World Cup qualifying campaign with a flawless finish as Harry Kane struck twice late in a 2-0 win over Albania in Tirana on Sunday. Thomas Tuchel’s side, already assured of their ticket to the 2026 World Cup, made history with their eighth successive Group K victory — becoming the first European team to complete a qualifying campaign of at least six matches with a 100 percent record and no goals conceded.England’s run is extraordinary by every metric. They are the first European nation since Germany in 2018 to win all their World Cup qualifiers, and they extended their unbeaten streak in such matches to 39, last losing in 2009. With 22 goals scored and none conceded, the Three Lions delivered one of the most dominant qualifying displays the continent has ever seen. Their 10 consecutive competitive wins without conceding equals Spain’s European record, while their nine wins from 10 matches in 2025 mark their best calendar-year win ratio since 1946.Tuchel, reflecting on a first year in charge that began — fittingly — with a win over Albania in March, praised his side’s resilience. “Today was difficult, emotional,” he said. “We were in control, then lost some control. It needed one little moment, a set piece or a moment of magic. So much good stuff and quality to see the game out.”Despite over 70 percent possession, England were made to work by an Albania team on an eight-match unbeaten run.Jude Bellingham, returning to the XI for the first time since June, helped inject urgency, driving forward to create Jarrod Bowen’s best first-half chance.Kane finally broke Albania’s resistance in the 74th minute, tapping in after Bukayo Saka’s corner caused panic in the six-yard box. Eight minutes later, he thumped home a header from Marcus Rashford’s precise cross, taking his tally to 78 goals in 112 appearances.With the draw set for December 5 in Washington, England will resume in March carrying genuine belief. Tuchel’s side have not only qualified — they have sent a message. Far tougher challenges await at the World Cup, but this perfect campaign has ignited hopes of ending the trophy wait stretching back to 1966.",Harry Kane scored twice as England beat Albania 2-0 in Tirana.

Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo faces a potential ban from Portugal's opening match if his team manages to win their European qualifying group.France achieved qualification with a convincing 4-0 victory against Ukraine at home, highlighted by Mbappé's double contribution. Portugal's path hit a roadblock after a surprising 2-0 defeat to Ireland in Dublin, where Ronaldo received his first-ever international red card.The French dominance continued in the second half as Michael Olise and substitute Hugo Ekitiké added to the scoresheet.At Parc des Princes in Paris, Mbappé opened the scoring with a penalty in the 55th minute. Olise extended the lead with a curling shot in the 76th minute, followed by Mbappé's close-range finish in the 83rd. This brought Mbappé's international goal tally to 55, just two behind Olivier Giroud's national record.""The French national team will always be better with him in it. He makes things easier for us.

Dak Prescott Finally Engaged To Girlfriend Sarah Jane Ramos

More NFL coverage

Dak Prescott and his fiancée, Sarah Jane Ramos, are in a new chapter as parents of two daughters. Their growing family has become a steady part of the quarterback’s life as his career continues to rise. Prescott, now the highest-paid player in league history, has shown that his off-field world is just as meaningful as anything he accomplishes with the Cowboys. Ramos has been at his side through record moments, personal milestones and the joy of parenthood, shaping a partnership rooted in support and shared growth.The couple first welcomed their daughter, Margaret Jane Rose, on Leap Day in 2024. Their second daughter, Aurora Rayne, arrived in May 2025, giving them a fuller home and an even stronger bond. With each milestone, Prescott has spoken about how fatherhood changed his sense of responsibility and purpose, and Ramos has echoed the same pride and excitement as they build their life together.Ramos grew up in Tampa Bay, Florida, and stayed close to home while studying criminalistics and criminal science at Florida State University. Her early career began in hospitality before she moved into the wine industry, where she built an impressive path as a specialist and later an on-premise area manager at Southern Glazer’s Wine & Spirits.Her work placed her at the center of well-known brands like Diageo and Moet Hennessy, and she carved out a reputation for herself long before she entered the public spotlight.Sports have always been part of her life. She cheers for the Cowboys, but her heart belongs to hockey. She often celebrated the Tampa Bay Lightning and once wrote, “Waking up to a Bolts win on a Monday > 👏😍.” Ramos also enjoys golf and has shared several moments from the course, showing how much she values being active and outdoors.Ramos and Prescott were first linked in 2023 after she attended a Cowboys win over the Giants. Their relationship became public when she posted a photo hugging him in a leather Cowboys jacket. By February 2024, they welcomed MJ Rose, writing, ""MJ Rose, Being your parents is the biggest blessing life has to offer and we are so fortunate that you are ours! Welcome into this world, baby girl, you will always be loved and protected! We are so IN LOVE with you. ""Prescott later shared, ""I feel different. When you wake up in the morning and you see that baby, you understand responsibilities."" Ramos added her own joy, telling Sports Illustrated, ""I can’t wait to watch Dak become a girl dad, part two. He’s perfect. He’s the best girl dad ever.""When Aurora Rayne arrived, Prescott celebrated with, ""Thank You God! Welcome, Aurora Rayne! May 22, 2025. God is Great. I love you @sarahjane and the Family we’ve created ♥️.""Their engagement followed months later. Prescott proposed with a golf-themed surprise, saying, “Yeah I’m super excited… I got the ring a few months ago. Set it up with a couple friends. She had no idea.” He reportedly spent $1 million on a 10-karat diamond, and jeweler Jason Arasheben said, “Dak was so easy to work with and was very intentional with every detail of this ring.”Together, Prescott and Ramos have built a life that balances football, family and a deep sense of commitment. Their relationship continues to show how much strength the quarterback draws from the people closest to him.","Dak Prescott and his fiancée, Sarah Jane Ramos, are parents of two daughters.

Cowboys coach’s decision creates early chaos in must-win game



More NFL coverage

The Dallas Cowboys walked into Week 11 needing clarity, rhythm and a win. Instead, the night opened with confusion as the team’s two most important receivers stood on the sideline. A must-win matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders at Allegiant Stadium should have started with Dallas leaning on its biggest playmakers. Instead, CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens were missing from the first offensive snap, and the surprise left fans and analysts trying to understand what went wrong.The moment grew even more puzzling when ESPN’s Lisa Salters shared that both receivers were healthy. The Cowboys had no injuries to report, yet Dak Prescott began the drive short handed. For a team trying to save its season, the decision created more questions than answers.According to Salters, the absence of Lamb and Pickens came down to coaching judgment rather than any physical setback. She said, ""I was just told by Cowboys PR that the reason that CeeDaa Lamb and George Pickens were not out on the field, it was not an injury related situation. It was strictly a coach's decision. I asked, was this punishment of some sort? And I was told you'll have to address that with Coach.But all we can tell you is that it was not injury related it was strictly a coach's decision. ""Dallas struggled instantly without them. The first drive opened with two runs by Javonte Williams, followed by a risky throw to Jalen Tolbert that nearly resulted in an interception. The offense lacked rhythm, and the absence of its top receivers was obvious. Both players returned for the next drive, but that possession ended swiftly after a Maxx Crosby strip sack of Prescott.Local reporters later learned the decision was disciplinary. Lamb and Pickens reportedly ""missed some things,"" which hinted at issues tied to team activities or travel expectations over the bye week.Heading into this game, Pickens had 49 catches for 764 yards and six touchdowns, while Lamb posted 35 grabs for 491 yards and one score. The Cowboys need both stars locked in if they hope to steer their season back on course. What Brian Schottenheimer says after the game may reveal how serious this situation truly is.","CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens were benched for the first offensive snap.

The Dallas Cowboys stepped into Monday Night Football carrying a weight no team ever wants to face. Their first game since the death of second year defensive end Marshawn Kneeland on Nov. 6 came with heavy emotion, and the organization made it clear that the night belonged to his memory. From the moment players walked onto the field for warm ups, the tone felt different. Quiet moments replaced the usual pregame noise as teammates tried to honor a life lost too soon while preparing to compete against the Las Vegas Raiders.Dallas focused on celebrating who Kneeland was and what he meant inside the locker room. The team chose to honor him in several ways that blended their grief with their commitment to play through it. Every detail, from their attire to the space saved for him, reflected how deeply the loss hit them.The story behind the Cowboys’ No. 94 tribute that turned Marshawn Kneeland’s memory into their biggest motivational forcePlayers and staff wore special shirts featuring a portrait of Kneeland, a gesture that made his presence feel close as they moved through warm ups. The team also revealed a helmet decal carrying his No. 94, which they plan to wear for the rest of the season. In a simple but powerful message, the Cowboys wrote, ""For 94,"" when sharing the first look at the sticker. Kneeland wore the number after joining Dallas as a second round pick from Western Michigan in the 2024 NFL Draft.Inside Allegiant Stadium, the Cowboys reserved a locker for him, hanging his No. 94 jersey as a quiet reminder of the teammate who should have been there. The Raiders joined the tribute by wearing shirts with 988 on the back, the number for the suicide hotline. They also planned a moment of silence before kickoff.Kneeland died in what Frisco police have described as a ""possible suicide."" Authorities said he was ""found deceased from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound"" after his abandoned vehicle was discovered following a crash. Police also noted he had ""expressed suicidal ideations"" before he was found.Kneeland appeared in 18 NFL games with four starts. His lone touchdown came two days before his death, when he recovered a blocked punt for a score against Arizona.","The Dallas Cowboys played their first game since the death of Marshawn Kneeland on Nov. 6.

Shedeur Sanders’ NFL debut took an unexpected turn that stretched far beyond the field. The Cleveland Browns rookie, who stepped into Sunday’s game after Dillon Gabriel suffered a head injury, experienced both the thrill of taking his first NFL snap and the shock of learning that his house in suburban Cleveland had reportedly been broken into during the game. Police are still gathering details, and it remains unclear what was taken or who was responsible. For Sanders, the day shifted from excitement to concern within a matter of hours.The timing of the break-in has sparked fresh questions about the growing trend of thieves targeting professional athletes while they play on live television. ProFootballTalk first reported the incident, adding Sanders to a list of victims that now includes Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce , Joe Burrow, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Ja Morant. Authorities have been tracking a rise in athlete home invasions for more than a year, and the FBI previously warned leagues about organized crime rings capable of coordinating these hits across multiple states.Fans inside Huntington Bank Field erupted when Sanders jogged onto the turf, ready to command the Browns offense. Reports said the excitement was so loud that players needed to quiet the crowd before his first snap. He fought to keep Cleveland alive, even guiding the team to Baltimore’s 25-yard line in a final attempt to tie the game. He completed four of sixteen passes for 47 yards, added 16 rushing yards and threw one interception before the Ravens closed out a 23-16 win.Once the game ended, the reality waiting for Sanders was far tougher than a box score. According to Mike Florio of ProFootballTalk, his home was broken into while he was playing. The incident follows several high-profile cases, including the October 2024 burglaries at the homes of Mahomes and Kelce, as well as break-ins involving Burrow and Cameron Jordan. Last season, the league circulated a memo advising players to secure their homes, limit social media postings and avoid showcasing expensive possessions.""It's legit,"" one source told NFL.com last year. ""It's a transnational crime ring, and over the last three weeks, they've focused on NBA and NFL players, and it's all over the country."" Even commissioner Roger Goodell admitted that “it’s clear” athletes like Mahomes, Burrow and Kelce are being targeted.For Sanders, the week ahead brings both emotional fallout and professional responsibility. As he deals with the break-in, he must also prepare in case he is called again for the Browns’ upcoming matchup with the Las Vegas Raiders.",Cleveland Browns rookie Shedeur Sanders' home was reportedly broken into during Sunday's game.

Brittany and Patrick Mahomes are known for sharing heartwarming family moments, but their latest video might be the funniest one they’ve ever posted. The couple took a break from their daily routine to try portrait painting, and the results quickly reminded the internet why capturing a face on canvas is never as easy as it looks. The clip, shared through CommunityAmerica Credit Union, showed the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback and his wife trading footballs for paintbrushes. From the moment Patrick studied Brittany’s artwork with a raised brow and a hopeful grin, viewers knew a memorable moment was coming.He walked toward the easel, paused to inspect the drawing and offered a warm review that carried the perfect blend of honesty and charm. “That looks pretty good. I’ll give the hair the best part… I got a little bit of goatee now. Other than that, I think you did a pretty good job. It looks like me,” he says. His reaction set the tone, but the real show began once Brittany turned her attention to his attempt. Even before she looked, Patrick warned her he wasn’t exactly an artist and asked for a little mercy.When Brittany finally spun his canvas around, her expression shifted in an instant.She stepped back, eyes wide, and delivered the line that sent the video into viral territory. “OH MY GOD! You made my teeth black!” she shouts. It was the type of spontaneous reaction that feels genuine and relatable, especially to anyone who has ever struggled in an art class.Their daughter Sterling wandered in moments later, curious about the commotion. One glance at the portrait was all it took for her to burst into laughter. Her lighthearted giggle tied the entire moment together, turning the clip into a playful family memory that fans couldn’t stop sharing.The humor worked because it was real. Patrick’s portrait wasn’t great, but the couple embraced the imperfections with ease. Brittany’s drawing, by comparison, looked like a masterpiece once the camera revealed his version. Patrick had already softened the moment by admitting he was “not the best painter in the world” and asking her not to judge him.Many viewers related to the struggle. Almost everyone has taken an art class and discovered how challenging portrait work can be. Luckily for Chiefs fans, Patrick’s talents remain far more reliable on the field. He may not have a future in painting, but he still ranks among the best quarterbacks in the world, and that’s one job he won’t be giving up any time soon.","The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback and his wife traded footballs for paintbrushes.

More coverage in NFL:

The Cleveland Browns’ quarterback situation has shifted dramatically ahead of Week 12. Dillon Gabriel has entered the NFL’s concussion protocol following the team’s recent loss to the Baltimore Ravens. With Gabriel sidelined, rookie Shedeur Sanders is now the top available quarterback on the active roster, creating a critical decision point for head coach Kevin Stefanski.Cleveland’s quarterback room has undergone significant changes this season. Joe Flacco and Kenny Pickett were traded, Tyler Huntley was released, and Dillon Gabriel’s injury leaves Sanders as the only healthy option. This development comes as the Browns prepare to face the Las Vegas Raiders, highlighting the importance of quarterback readiness and depth in the organization.Gabriel remains in the NFL concussion protocol, which requires players to complete a five-step process before returning to play. The steps include symptom-limited activity, aerobic exercise, football-specific drills, non-contact team drills, and full clearance from both team physicians and independent neurotrauma consultants. Given the standard timeline for concussion recovery, Gabriel is unlikely to be available for Week 12.Shedeur Sanders, a rookie out of Colorado, made his NFL debut in Week 11 when he replaced Gabriel in the second half against the Ravens. Sanders completed 4 of 16 passes for 47 yards, threw one interception, and posted a passer rating of 13.5. He also rushed for 16 yards on three carries. Sanders’ performance, though limited, positions him as the most immediate option at quarterback if Gabriel cannot return.The Browns also have Bailey Zappe on the practice squad. Zappe has prior starting experience with the New England Patriots and previously started a game for Cleveland. While he is an available option, Sanders remains the likely choice based on current roster positioning and protocol timelines. Zappe could still see action if the team prefers a more experienced option at quarterback in Week 12.The Browns’ quarterback depth chart currently features Dillon Gabriel, Shedeur Sanders, and Bailey Zappe (practice squad). With Gabriel in concussion protocol, the Week 12 starter will likely be Sanders, making this a crucial moment for Cleveland’s offense as the team navigates quarterback availability and continuity.","Dillon Gabriel has entered the NFL’s concussion protocol.

Drake London PCL sprain and Michael Penix Jr. injury hit Falcons' Week 12 offense



More coverage in NFL:

The Atlanta Falcons are reeling from major injuries that could affect their performance in the coming weeks. Wide receiver Drake London suffered a PCL sprain in his knee during the Week 11 loss to the Carolina Panthers, ruling him out for at least one game. Quarterback Michael Penix Jr. has also been placed on injured reserve with an ACL injury, sidelining him for a minimum of four weeks.These setbacks come at a crucial point in the season, as London and Penix Jr. are central to the Falcons’ offensive strategy. London leads the team with six touchdown receptions this season, while Penix Jr. serves as the primary quarterback directing the passing attack. Their simultaneous absences present significant challenges for Atlanta’s offense in Week 12 and beyond.Testing on London’s knee confirmed a PCL sprain, ruling him out for the upcoming Week 12 matchup against the New Orleans Saints on November 23. While the injury could require only a short-term absence, PCL sprains can sometimes extend recovery time depending on severity. Head coach Raheem Morris emphasized the team’s need to adjust offensive schemes in response to the absence of their top receiver. This makes London’s recovery timeline a key factor for Atlanta’s offensive strategy in the coming weeks.Penix Jr.’s placement on injured reserve intensifies the Falcons’ offensive challenges, as he is expected to miss at least four games. With both the starting quarterback and lead wide receiver sidelined, backup players must take on key roles to keep the offense functioning. The coaching staff will also need to adjust game plans and maximize alternative offensive options, including running plays and secondary receivers, to maintain momentum. These injuries put added pressure on the Falcons to quickly find consistency in their passing game.The Falcons’ Week 11 defeat to the Panthers highlighted the impact of these injuries. With London and Penix Jr. out, Atlanta’s offense faces a critical period requiring strategic adjustments and depth contributions to remain competitive. Monitoring recovery updates for both players will be essential to evaluating the team’s prospects for the remainder of the season.",Drake London PCL sprain and Michael Penix Jr. injury hit Falcons' Week 12 offense.

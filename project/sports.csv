NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 clash between Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) was marred by rain, marking the first no-result game of the season.The match had a promising start with PBKS posting a solid total, but the weather decided to play spoilsport, with rain halting play early in KKR's chase, leaving the game abandoned.Punjab Kings set a strong total of 201/4, thanks to splendid half-centuries from Prabhsimran Singh and Priyansh Arya .Arya, who had already impressed this season, continued his dream debut campaign by scoring a rapid 69 off 35 balls.He was well supported by Prabhsimran, who made an explosive 83 off 49 deliveries.The pair put on a blistering 120-run partnership, but the momentum slowed in the final overs as KKR's bowlers, led by Vaibhav Arora (2/34) and Andre Russell (1/27), pulled things back.Despite a strong start, KKR's bowlers, including Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy, couldn’t keep up with the scorching pace set by the PBKS openers.However, they made some key breakthroughs in the death overs, preventing Punjab from reaching a daunting total.As KKR began their chase, the weather turned, and heavy rain forced the players off the field.The rain delay left fans hoping for a brief break, but the downpour persisted, and it soon became clear that the match wouldn’t continue. The match was officially called off, with the points being shared between the two teams.This no-result could prove valuable for PBKS, who will see the point as an important addition to their playoff bid. For KKR, it's another frustrating setback at home as they continue to struggle in IPL 2025.","IPL 2025 match between Punjab Kings and Kolkata Knight Riders called off.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

NEW DELHI: If we compare the spin attacks of Delhi Capitals (DC) and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), DC would certainly have the upper hand, thanks to their spin arsenal, which includes Kuldeep Yadav, captain Axar Patel, and the young Vipraj Nigam.On the other hand, RCB have leg-spinner Suyash Sharma and left-arm spinner Krunal Pandya Delhi Capitals will enter the highly anticipated clash against RCB on Sunday at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi with a power-packed spin attack. However, considering the impact of Krunal and Suyash — the way they have turned things around for RCB this season with their lines, lengths, and mind games — RCB will surely pose a serious challenge.Sitting in third place on the points table with six wins and riding high after their first home victory, RCB’s season so far has been defined by solid contributions from Krunal and Suyash.Krunal didn’t have the best season with Lucknow Super Giants last year, claiming just six wickets in 14 matches. After playing three seasons for LSG, he was acquired by RCB for Rs 5.75 crore in the IPL 2025 mega auction.Since then, his fortunes have turned around dramatically, with Krunal emerging as a key player in RCB’s impressive campaign so far.Not only has Krunal picked up 12 wickets in nine matches, but he has also become a crucial asset for his captain, trusted to bowl in tight situations. He has been effective in the death overs, keeping batters under control, and contributing significantly to RCB's success.At 34, Krunal continues to evolve his game.RCB’s spin bowling coach Malolan Rangarajan spoke about the combination of the young Suyash and all-rounder Krunal as frontline spinners. He spoke about Suyash’s ability to beat the bat and turn the ball, along with the evolution of Krunal’s action over the years.""As far as Krunal Pandya is concerned, he is somebody who, if you saw his videos from 2016 or 2017-18, it was a completely different action. He has worked on his action. His release is very different to what it was, maybe even two years back,"" Malolan told reporters ahead of the DC vs RCB clash.""There are so many things they are doing. And that is the variation we have within the attack. Suyash Sharma is not a household name yet, but he will become one. That is the belief we have as a management. And Krunal Pandya, we all know what he's done. He's won the IPL a handful of times, and he is here only for one job. And I am not going to say what it is. We will see at the end of the season,"" he said.Delhi boy Suyash Sharma began his IPL career with KKR in 2023 and had an impressive debut season, picking up 10 wickets in 11 matches.However, he had a forgettable 2024 season with KKR, featuring in just two games without taking a wicket. Subsequently, he was released by the three-time champions and was picked up by RCB for Rs 2.60 crore ahead of IPL 2025.Rangarajan highlighted Suyash’s speed and his ability to beat the bat on both edges as key strengths, which have significantly benefitted the team this season.""He showed that with the dismissal of Josh Inglis, which was outside of the bat. The dismissal of Russell was through the batter. So, he does turn the ball. His super-strength is the ability to turn the ball, beat the bat on both edges, and bowl at a very high speed, so to speak. Plus, his action is peculiar in its way. So, that makes it slightly tough for the batter to read,"" said the coach.","Delhi Capitals take on Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) on Sunday. RCB have leg-spinner Suyash Sharma and left-arm spinner Krunal Pandya. DC have Kuldeep Yadav, captain Axar Patel, and the young Vipraj Nigam.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120649195,imgsize-70396,width-400,resizemode-4/RCB.jpg"

Result: Match abandoned.

NEW DELHI: Defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders and Punjab Kings were forced to share a point each after rain washed out their Indian Premier League 2025 clash at Eden Gardens on Saturday — the season's first match to end without a result.Chasing 202 for victory, KKR were seven for no loss after one over when rain interrupted play.

Arya shifted gears midway, completing a 27-ball fifty, before falling to Andre Russell.Prabhsimran continued to attack before departing to Vaibhav Arora after his second half-century of the season. Despite key breakthroughs from Kolkata’s bowlers, Punjab crossed the 200-mark, with skipper Shreyas Iyer and Josh Inglis providing a late surge.KKR’s cautious start was cut short by the rain, sealing an anticlimactic finish.201 for 4 in 20 overs (Priyansh Arya 69, Prabhsimran Singh 83, Shreyas Iyer 25 not out; Vaibhav Arora 2/34).7 for no loss in 1 over.","Kolkata Knight Riders and Punjab Kings share a point after IPL 2025 clash called off due to rain.

With 263 runs and three fifties, Iyer now has a chance to deliver a KL Rahul-style statement knock against his former team.KKR, however, are floundering with five losses in eight. Their top-order is shaky, the middle-order misfiring, and spin options underwhelming on home turf.Calls for change may see Rovman Powell come in, while Angkrish Raghuvanshi remains a lone batting bright spot. Ajinkya Rahane’s conservative approach and Sunil Narine’s lack of impact have also added pressure.PBKS, on the other hand, look confident with Marco Jansen’s early bursts, Nehal Wadhera’s finishing skills, and Arshdeep Singh’s 11 wickets leading the attack. Yuzvendra Chahal, who wrecked KKR in their 95 all-out collapse last week, looms large again.KKR must win five of their remaining six to stay in playoff contention, but with just one home win this season and internal issues, including pitch controversies, they face a tough task.Saturday’s clash is more than just a game: it’s personal, tactical, and possibly season-defining.Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh , Andre Russell, Moeen Ali, Ramandeep Singh , Harshit Rana, Vaibhav Arora, Varun Chakaravarthy, Angkrish RaghuvanshiPrabhsimran Singh, Priyansh Arya, Shreyas Iyer (c), Josh Inglis(wk), Nehal Wadhera, Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Marco Jansen, Xavier Bartlett, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra Chahal, Harpreet BrarBrace for a hot Saturday in Kolkata.

Referees holding a press conference is unconventional and raised quite a few eyebrows - not least at the Santiago Bernabeu and among the Real Madrid faithful.In the press conference, Bengoetxea became emotional while discussing the intense pressure he faces ahead of the match.He was questioned about a video released by Real Madrid's Club channel, Real Madrid TV, which highlighted his supposed mistakes in previous matches against them. This season RMTV have hit out at refereeing mistakes frequently and the club has refused to make its players available for mandatory media bytes with the official broadcaster for La Liga.When asked about the video, Bengoetxea could not hold back tears as he spoke about the impact on him and his family.""When your son comes back from school and other kids have said to him that his father is a thief, it's really hard,"" he said. ""They have no right to make us go through this, but it's not just something between professionals; a lot of families depend on this, and everyone should take some time to reflect on what they are doing.""Pablo Gonzalez Fuentes, who will serve as the VAR official for the Copa del Rey final, also criticised RMTV's actions. ""They have to understand the consequences of these videos,"" he said, explaining that they lead to online campaigns against officials.""We're seeing community managers on official social media platforms attacking the community for just one more like. We see actions by football players that suggest we're dishonest. When a journalist talks about 'theft,' fans take that frustration out on the child who's about to referee a youth team. We must address these types of situations and return to a healthier and cleaner style of football,"" he commented.""The consequences are that when you talk about theft and bad language, the frustration you generate in the fans is paid for by the little boy or girl who grabs a whistle and has to officiate a junior's game. It's the consequence of putting the target on a teammate's head,"" he added.After the press conference by the officials, Real Madrid, who had finished training in the Spanish capital and were to leave for Seville later, went into a huddle on a possible response.In retaliation, Real Madrid refused to hold their open training session at La Cartuja (scheduled for 8pm), a press conference with under-fire manager Carlo Ancelotti and a member of the squad. Additionally, Florentino Perez skipped the traditional presidents' dinner and the club missed the pre-match photo-call.In a statement on the club website, Real Madrid said the complaints by the referees were 'unacceptable'. ""These statements... made in a premeditated manner 24 hours before the final against one of the participants, demonstrate, once again, a clear and manifest animosity and hostility of these referees towards Real Madrid,"" said the Spanish league champions.Los Blancos took particular issue with the final's VAR referee Fuertes suggesting referees were ""united"" and looking to take collective action against the pressure they had received from Real Madrid TV.""Even more surprising statements, in a threatening tone... to announce supposed measures or actions that are far removed from the principles of fairness, objectivity and impartiality that should prevail just hours before (the final),"" continued Madrid's statement.""In view of the seriousness of what has happened, Real Madrid hopes that those in charge of the RFEF and the refereeing profession will act accordingly, adopting the relevant measures in defence of the prestige of the institutions they represent.""As per Spanish media, Real Madrid wanted the referees changed for the final and there were suggestions of the team pulling out of the competiiton and returning home.However at 10pm local time, Real Madrid rubbished those suggestions and claimed this option hadn't been considered.""In light of the rumours that have arisen in the last few hours, Real Madrid C.F. communicates that our team never considered refusing to play tomorrow's final.""Real Madrid understands that football's values must prevail, despite the hostility and animosity that has today once again been shown against our club, by the referees appointed for the final,"" said the statement.Madrid-based sports dailyreported later there was a conversation between Rafael Louzan, president of the Spanish FA , which oversees the Copa del Rey, and Real Madrid camp. It claims that RFEF acknowledged the inappropriateness of the comments made by the referees and made clear that Fuertes will not officiate Real Madrid matches for the rest of the season while leaving his role at the Technical Committee of Referees (CTA).","Real Madrid take on Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final on Saturday.

Police confirmed that Jackson Rodríguez 's family, who were abducted from their Guayaquil residence, have been safely rescued. The Ecuadorian footballer, aged 26, sought shelter beneath his bed whilst four armed assailants in hoods abducted his wife, 24, and son, 5, on Wednesday from their residence in Mucho Lote.Police commander Pablo Dávila confirmed that both mother and child were unharmed and received necessary medical care post-rescue. Despite the kidnappers' demand for USD 500,000, the family did not comply. Rodríguez currently plays as a left back for Emelec in the first division.The victims were discovered late Thursday in ""El Fortín"", a notoriously unsafe district in northwest Guayaquil where a March incident resulted in 22 fatalities.Guayaquil is situated 270 kilometres southwest of Quito.The incident occurred during a government-declared state of emergency spanning nine regions, including Guayas province where Guayaquil is located. This measure enables security forces to counter organised crime in these areas.Ecuador has experienced increased criminal activity over four years, with a surge in early 2023. Official records show 2,345 violent deaths between January and March, with 742 occurring in Guayaquil.The coastal city serves as a significant transit point for illegal drugs destined for Europe, Central America, and the United States, according to officials.Previously, other sportspersons have faced similar threats. In December, Liga de Quito player Pedro Perlaza was abducted in Esmeraldas, 182 kilometres northwest of Quito, before being rescued days later.","Jackson Rodríguez's family were abducted from their Guayaquil residence.

Poll Will Liverpool secure the Premier League title against Tottenham? No, they will not win Yes, they will win

Liverpool manager Arne Slot is preparing for a potential Premier League title celebration at Anfield on Sunday against Tottenham, needing just one point to secure the club's record-equalling 20th English championship. The achievement would come five years after their last title, which was celebrated in an empty stadium during the COVID-19 pandemic.Liverpool currently lead Arsenal by 12 points with five games remaining in their campaign, while Arsenal have only four matches left to play.""It's a big responsibility. We are aware that the last time this club won the league was during the Covid time. So everybody is looking forward to Sunday,"" Slot told reporters on Friday.""We know there's still a job to do. We need at least one point. Our fans know as well. When they come to the stadium they have to support us in the best possible way as they have done all season. It's a nice game to look forward to but also a responsibility we have for Sunday.""The title could have been decided earlier this week when Arsenal faced Crystal Palace. Liverpool's players and staff gathered to watch the match together, hoping to celebrate, but the game ended in a 2-2 draw.""It was different. Normally when you watch a game of football, you are either alone or with family or friends. But we watched it all together,"" Slot said. ""Before the game, I would have been surprised if the game ended in a draw. But during the game, I wasn't because Crystal Palace again showed what this league is all about.""The upcoming achievement would see Liverpool match Manchester United's record of 20 English titles. Slot, in his first season after replacing Jurgen Klopp, would become the first Dutch manager to win the Premier League.""No, I get these questions so it comes to your mind but it is the last thing you think of as a manager at this time. We saw last week how hard it was to get a win against a team that was nearly relegated at Leicester,"" Slot said. ""I am not getting carried away. We have faced Tottenham three times and I know how hard it is to beat them.""Liverpool's impressive season under Slot has seen them lose only twice in the league. The manager acknowledges the expectations that come with leading the club.""This club has to win trophies,"" Slot said. ""The good thing is most managers work here a long time so you have a few chances to win trophies. You are aware of that but that is not the first thing that you think about when you walk through this door.""Some have suggested Liverpool's success comes from Manchester City's decline and Arsenal's injury problems. Slot responded to these claims.""Everybody can have their own opinion. You might have a different opinion. That is the nice thing about the world we are living in. I am only here for a year so I can only tell you what I experienced,"" Slot said. ""It has never been as hard to end up in the top four or five. In my opinion it is a really difficult league.""If Liverpool fail to secure the title against Tottenham, their next opportunity would come at Chelsea in their following league fixture.","Liverpool manager Arne Slot preparing for potential Premier League title celebration.

Leicester City captain Jamie Vardy will part ways with the club at the end of the season, bringing the curtain down on a legendary spell that spanned over a decade. The club, relegated from the Premier League this year, confirmed the news on Thursday.Vardy, who famously led Leicester’s fairytale 2015/16 title-winning campaign, has been described by the club as ""our greatest-ever player.""Signed from non-league Fleetwood Town for just £1 million in 2012, Vardy went on to score 198 goals in nearly 500 appearances, becoming Leicester’s all-time top scorer in the Premier League with 143 goals. His remarkable tally of 24 goals in the 2015/16 season played a pivotal role in the Foxes’ historic title triumph.The 38-year-old also featured in Leicester's 2021 FA Cup final win over Chelsea, further cementing his status as a club legend.""We can confirm legendary striker Jamie Vardy will leave Leicester City this summer after 13 seasons that have seen him become our greatest-ever player,"" read the club's statement.""Jamie is unique,"" said chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha. ""He is a special player and an even more special person. He holds a place in the hearts of everyone connected to Leicester City, and he certainly has my deepest respect and affection. I am endlessly grateful for everything he has given to this football club.""Vardy admitted he was heartbroken by the decision but acknowledged the time was right.""To the fans of Leicester, I'm gutted that this day is coming, but I knew it was going to come eventually,"" he said in a video posted on social media. ""I've spent 13 unbelievable years at this club, with lots of success, and some downs, but the majority have all been highs.""Vardy, the last remaining player from the 2016 title-winning squad, stayed with Leicester after their 2023 relegation and helped them earn promotion back to the Premier League. However, the club now faces a return to the Championship after another poor campaign.In 31 league appearances this season, Vardy scored seven goals. After relegation was confirmed following a 1-0 defeat to Liverpool, he offered a brutally honest verdict on the season.""This season has been nothing but miserable and for me personally, a total embarrassment,"" he wrote on social media. ""It hurts.""With Ruud van Nistelrooy’s side languishing in 19th place with 18 points from 33 games, Vardy's final appearance at the King Power Stadium is set for May 18 against Ipswich Town — who are also on the brink of relegation.","Jamie Vardy will leave Leicester City at the end of the season.

CHENNAI: After a nightmarish Indian Super League campaign, where they did not even come close to qualifying for the playoffs, Chennaiyin FC will be eager to salvage some pride in the Super Cup in Bhubaneswar. Chennaiyin will begin their run with a challenging round-of-16 fixture against ISL big gun Mumbai City FC on Wednesday.The knockout tournament offers CFC another opportunity to end a long wait – while Chennaiyin have not won silverware since their 2017-18 ISL triumph, they have not been at the continental level since the 2018-19 season. For CFC to pose a threat, they will have to stay “consistent”, a quality that head coach Owen Coyle believes they lacked in the ISL.“When we are at our best, we can stand toe-to-toe with the best teams. The cup competition is a great opportunity for everybody, because there is an AFC spot up for grabs. There is an incentive for everyone to go and win the cup,” Coyle said.“We started the ISL season well and finished strongly. We had a poor middle section of the season. For sure, there is added motivation to finish the season on a high. We were very inconsistent in the ISL; that is what cost us a place in the top-six. We have to get back to giving good performances consistently,” added Coyle.Chennaiyin should show drastic improvement in the defensive department, after keeping only four clean sheets in the league stage of the ISL. The luxury to use both Ryan Edwards and Elsinho at the heart of defence at the same time – a club can field a maximum of six foreigners – could solve some issues for the chief coach.Coyle acknowledged that there is a huge scope for improvement in defence but stressed that the team would not get into a shell for the sake of a clean sheet. “That (poor defending) was the biggest thing that hurt us in the ISL; we did not defend well enough. But in cup competitions, you have to win games. We will certainly not be seeing a more defensive approach; we will see a team going out to win games,” said Coyle.What should give CFC a bit of hope for Wednesday’s game is the fact that Mumbai could miss a few key players due to different reasons (injuries, rehabilitation and personal situation). While Jon Toral and Jayesh Rane have been ruled out of the tournament, Yoell van Nieff, Jeremy Manzorro and Prabir Das are doubtful starters for the clash on Wednesday.Asked if CFC will have the upper hand, Coyle replied: “We are under no illusion; Mumbai are a wonderful side. Van Nieff and Manzorro could probably make it to the game. They have many good Indian players like Lallianzuala Chhangte, Vikram Pratap Singh and Mehtab Singh who add to the mix.”",Chennaiyin FC face Mumbai City FC in the Indian Super League (ISL) Super Cup.

IF ARSENAL WIN:

Liverpool are on the verge of securing their second Premier League title, needing just three points from their remaining five matches to become champions. Arsenal's victory over Ipswich Town has pushed the earliest possible title confirmation date to Wednesday (April 23), when Arsenal face Crystal Palace.Liverpool currently sit at the top of the Premier League table with 79 points after 33 games played, holding a commanding 13-point lead over second-placed Arsenal, who have 66 points.The Reds require only three points from their available 15 to mathematically secure their 20th overall league title. Even if Arsenal win all their remaining matches, they can only reach 81 points, while Liverpool would have 82 points with just one more victory.The title race could be decided as early as Wednesday if Arsenal lose to Crystal Palace at home. In this scenario, Arsenal would remain on 66 points with only 12 points left to play for, making it mathematically impossible to catch Liverpool.Should Arsenal defeat Crystal Palace, Liverpool could still clinch the title on Sunday (April 27), with a victory over Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield. This would put Arne Slot's team 13 points ahead with only four matches remaining.The current Premier League standings show Liverpool in first place with 79 points and a goal difference of +44, while Arsenal occupy second position with 66 points and a +34 goal difference. Third place follows with 60 points and a +14 goal difference.Arsenal's win at Ipswich Town on Sunday eliminated the possibility of Liverpool securing the title that day, shifting the focus to the upcoming midweek fixtures as the next potential title-deciding moment.The title race has now entered its final phase with just five weekends of action remaining in the 2024/25 Premier League season. Both teams have challenging fixtures ahead as they navigate through the closing stages of the campaign.This upcoming period will determine whether Liverpool can maintain their substantial lead and secure their second Premier League title, or if Arsenal can mount an unlikely late challenge in the remaining matches.","Liverpool currently sit at the top of the Premier League table with 79 points after 33 games played.

Trent Alexander-Arnold fired Liverpool to the brink of the Premier League title as his late strike sealed a 1-0 win that relegated Leicester after Arsenal's 4-0 rout of Ipswich delayed the leaders' coronation on Sunday.Arne Slot's side could have clinched a record-equalling 20th English title with a combination of an Arsenal loss and a victory at the King Power Stadium.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Liverpool fulfilled their half of the equation, but second-placed Arsenal were not so obliging earlier in the afternoon.The Gunners' stroll at Portman Road meant Liverpool kicked off still needing six points from their last six games to seal a first title since 2020.Thanks to Alexander-Arnold's match-winning contribution after coming off the bench, Liverpool are 13 points clear of Arsenal with five games left for both teams.The Reds will seal the title if Arsenal lose at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday or if they beat Tottenham at Anfield on April 27.It looked like being a frustrating day for Liverpool as second-bottom Leicester kept them at bay despite a host of chances for the visitors.Slot's men finally made the breakthrough in the 76th minute when Alexander-Arnold lashed home the rebound from close-range after Mohamed Salah and Diogo Jota both hit the crossbar.With speculation mounting that Alexander-Arnold will join Real Madrid when his contract expires at the end of the season, it was notable that the England right-back embarked on a wild celebration of his winner.Alexander-Arnold earned a booking for ripping off his shirt and planting it on the corner flag after he sprinted to 3,000 jubilant Liverpool fans in one corner of the King Power.""It took us a long time and, of course, a great moment for Trent after working so hard to come back. To score the goal that makes a lot of difference is very special,"" Slot said.""It's never hard to dream (of the title) but you see we are really focused on playing Tottenham.""Liverpool's title celebration is only a matter of time but Leicester will spend next season in the Championship after their woeful one-year stay in the top tier came to an end with a 23rd defeat in 33 league games.Fresh from a famous victory over Real Madrid on Wednesday to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time since 2009, Arsenal ensured Liverpool would not be able to start their party this weekend.Mikel Arteta made only three changes from the 2-1 win in the Spanish capital and was rewarded with a dominant display to kill the game off inside half an hour.""All we can do is delay that moment (Liverpool win the league) from our side to earn the right to finish as high as possible,"" Arteta said.Leandro Trossard was one of those recalled by Arteta and prodded in his eighth goal of the season to open the scoring.A flowing move saw Bukayo Saka's cross flicked by Mikel Merino into the path of Gabriel Martinelli to finish to double the Gunners lead.Moments later, Saka was chopped down by an awful challenge from Leif Davis that saw the Ipswich left-back shown a straight red card.Trossard fired in his second after a well-worked corner before Ethan Nwaneri's deflected effort rounded off the scoring.Defeat realistically ends third-bottom Ipswich's hope of maintaining their Premier League status as they are 15 points adrift of safety with five games remaining and have a significantly poorer goal difference than West Ham.Chelsea needed two late goals at Fulham to revive their chances of Champions League football next season with a dramatic 2-1 victory.Alex Iwobi opened the scoring on 20 minutes and Chelsea were meandering towards a damaging defeat until 19-year-old substitute Tyrique George fired in a snap shot from the edge of the box on 83 minutes.Pedro Neto then completed the comeback with a stunning strike in stoppage-time to secure Chelsea's sixth win in their last 17 league games.Fifth-placed Chelsea moved above Nottingham Forest, who travel to Tottenham on Monday. Manchester United succumbed to an eighth home league defeat of the season as Wolves won 1-0 at Old Trafford.Pablo Sarabia curled in a brilliant free-kick 13 minutes from time to hand United a club record 15th league loss this term.Wolves' fifth consecutive Premier League win lifts Vitor Pereira's side up to 15th and level on points with United, who stay 14th on goal difference.",Trent Alexander-Arnold scores winner as Liverpool beat Leicester 1-0.

He also shared a series of candid pictures from the track, including some behind-the-scenes moments — one of which resembled a recent post by F1 driver Alex Albon.Taking to Instagram, Norman Nato posted a few pictures from Italy and wrote a caption summarizing his experience at the 6 Hours of Imola. He wrote: “Difficult weekend in Imola with P10 in race. Still early process with our new team, we keep learning. As always after a difficult one, we gonna analyse and make progress to come back stronger for the next one in Spa @cadillacvseries @jota_sport.”Encouraging him, Cadillac’s official Instagram page commented: “Building and growing,” along with clapping emojis.

With five rounds now complete in the 2024–25 Formula E World Championship, there are still 11 races to go before the season concludes in July. In Miami, it was Tag Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein who took the top podium spot. However, despite the win, the German-Mauritian driver currently sits third in the overall drivers' standings.Current driver standings for this seasonLeading the championship is Nissan’s Oliver Rowland with 69 points. Rowland had a tough outing in Miami, finishing 10th and earning just one point. But his overall journey this season has been inspiring—starting the Sao Paulo E-Prix in December with zero points, he bounced back impressively. He clinched victory in the Mexico E-Prix (25 points), finished second in Jeddah Part 1 (18 points), and won Jeddah Part 2 (25 points). Thanks to this strong mid-season performance, his lacklustre Miami result hasn’t dented his lead.In second place is Tag Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa with 54 points. He finished runner-up in both the Sao Paulo and Mexico E-Prix races. While his performance dipped in the Jeddah double-header, he recovered well by finishing third in Miami and collecting 15 crucial points.Close behind is his teammate, Pascal Wehrlein, with 51 points. Wehrlein had a disappointing start in Sao Paulo but bounced back with a third-place finish in Mexico. Although his results in Jeddah were average, his win in Miami has significantly boosted his title hopes. A strong showing in Monaco could push him past Da Costa into second place.Also tied at 51 points is the youngest driver on the grid, Taylor Barnard. He impressed with a third-place finish in Sao Paulo and podiums in both Jeddah races—third in Part 1 and second in Part 2.

Formula E drivers Norman Nato and Nyck De Vries are currently in Italy for the second round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC).

Nato finished 9th, while De Vries secured 5th place in the session.Norman Nato, who races for Nissan in the Formula E Championship, represents Cadillac Racing in collaboration with Hertz Team Jota in the Hypercar category of the Endurance Championship. Nyck De Vries, from Mahindra Racing’s Formula E team, finished 5th in the Imola qualifying. He competes for Toyota Gazoo Racing in the WEC, alongside teammate Ryo Hirakawa, who placed 4th in qualifying.Calling it his best effort on track, De Vries told Toyota Europe Newsroom: “As a team, I think we can be fairly satisfied with qualifying fourth and fifth here. We maximised our package, as you can see from the tiny gap between the two cars. I don’t think we could have done much better than that; we did a strong job to execute a clean qualifying. The gap to the front cars looks quite big over one lap, but we will do our best with race pace, tyre management, and strategy to challenge for the podium.”Both drivers are now set to compete in the final race of the 6 Hours of Imola on Sunday, scheduled from 1 PM to 7 PM local time.In their last Formula E outing at the Homestead-Miami Speedway, Nato faced heartbreak after losing what looked like a sure win due to post-race penalties. Although he clinched pole and crossed the line first at the Miami E-Prix, he was relegated to 6th place in the revised results.De Vries had qualified 5th in Miami but ultimately dropped to 11th in the final standings after penalties were applied.Following this, they’ll shift focus to Round 6 of the Formula E World Championship—the highly anticipated Monaco double-header on May 3 and 4.

His last podium came in Season 9, when he was part of Mahindra Racing.The 40-year-old shared his journey to the podium after the win. He said, “It’s very hard to start the project from zero so in the four races, I had four critical problems that pretty much didn’t allow me to finish the race. So I was like, it’s extremely (tough), you need to have a lot of discipline to be able to continue the work and continue to push when you have bad results.”“When you have good results, it’s very easy. But when you have bad results, to go back home, keep the focus, keep the head down and keep doing the work that you do that at one point it’s going to pay off. It’s hard because you work, it doesn’t. Then you work again, it doesn’t pay off again. And then you keep working until it pays off. And today was a day it paid off. So I am very happy.”It was also emotional to see Di Grassi’s wife, Bianca Diniz Caloi, and their young children standing alongside him on the podium as they popped the champagne.

His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace. The season concludes with an award for the top-ranked pairing.After Round 5 in Miami, the leaderboard has Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne and his race engineer Thibault Arnal on number 2. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries and race engineer Tom Bayles are in third position in the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard.The FIA Formula E Instagram account also shared the update, posting:“@nico.mueller51 overtaking his way up the rankings! With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued. Drivers including Norman Nato, Robin Frijns, Oliver Rowland, Sam Bird, and Taylor Barnard were penalized 10 seconds each for misuse of Attack Mode, while Nick Cassidy received a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits.Also Read: Formula E Miami E-Prix 2025: Jake Hughes crashes at chicane, here’s how the multi-car collision changed the outcome.

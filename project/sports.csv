Poll What do you think is Jasprit Bumrah's biggest strength as a bowler? Exceptional bowling skills Brilliant cricket brain Unique bowling action Ability to outsmart batters

Injuries, rain, availability concerns: Team India on edge in Manchester | Exclusive updates ahead of 4th Test

Without a doubt, Jasprit Bumrah is unique in every sense, in short he is a cheat code.If India has become a force to reckon with overseas, a lot of credit should go to Jasprit Bumrah. The Indian speedster has played 47 Tests and picked up 217 wickets at an average of 19.48.India batter Cheteshwar Pujara , who has spent a lot of time fielding while Bumrah bowls, revealed what he believes is the pacer's biggest strength.“Most people talk about Bumrah’s skills with the ball, his angle or his action, but his biggest strength is often overlooked,” said Pujara in his BBC column.“He has a brilliant cricket brain, which comes from his time in the IPL “There he worked with people like former Sri Lanka bowler Lasith Malinga and has gained the skills to outsmart a batter.“His first instinct is always to bowl his best ball, but if a batter gets in, he knows all of their strengths and weaknesses.“He has taken the skills from white-ball cricket to become the complete Test bowler.”Pujara also shared one of his favourite moments from India’s tour of England in 2018, when Jasprit Bumrah helped him reach his century.“I was on 96 when he came out at number 11, and I have to admit I did not think I would get there, but he walked in and said, ‘I will defend. I don’t know if I will survive, but I will do my best.’“I ended up finishing on 132 not out as we put on 46 for the last wicket.“That day sums him up – because whether batting or bowling, he is a very competitive cricketer,” said Pujara.","Jasprit Bumrah has played 47 Tests and picked up 217 wickets at an average of 19.48.

Poll Should India consider including Kuldeep Yadav if the pitch offers turn? Yes, definitely No, stick to current players Only if absolutely necessary

Anshul Kamboj Joins India Nets After Nitish’s Injury | Debut Incoming at Manchester?

TimesofIndia.com in Manchester: Fourth Test and India are set to have their fourth different bowling combination of the series as injuries have forced them to make some tweaks. The series started in Leeds with India beefing up the pace attack, but they moved towards batting depth with the inclusion of Washington Sundar and Nitish Kumar Reddy for Edgbaston and Lord's. The collapses in Leeds weren't ideal and to cover all bases, and add a sixth bowling option, the two all-rounders were drafted into the XIs for the next two Tests.That template, however, now needs to be tweaked with Reddy out of the series due to injury, and India are in a huddle for the ideal combination. The options look very straightforward at the moment – add an extra specialist batter in Sai Sudharsan or go back to Shardul Thakur and continue with the bits-and-pieces template. Going back to Sai will lend a Leeds look to this XI and provide a lot of depth to their batting, while also keeping the five bowling options – Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Anshul Kamboj, Ravindra Jadeja , and Sundar – intact.Shubman Gill had six at his disposal in the previous two Tests, but given the situation they are in at the moment, it may not be a bad idea to add a specialist batter and operate with three quicks and two spinners. Kamboj's fresh legs will definitely come in handy in a must-win game.What are the other options? One is to drop Karun Nair, get Sai Sudharsan at No.3, and let Shardul Thakur take on the responsibility of contributing with both bat and ball.He was underbowled in Leeds, didn’t make any substantial contribution with the bat in the two innings, and warmed the bench for the next two Tests.He presents an option, but the management clearly wants some control and consistency in the good areas from their bowlers, and that’s why it wasn’t a surprise that Prasidh Krishna had to wait close to 45 minutes before getting the opportunity to bowl in the nets. Krishna looked very sharp during his spell, but he hasn’t been able to translate the penetration into performance on match days.There was a sense of inclination towards Sudharsan in the nets on Monday, as the youngster practised in the gully positions, batted in tandem with Karun Nair, and was regularly in conversation with batting coach Sitanshu Kotak. Even before the players started warming up, Sudharsan went straight to the pitch, got a nice feel of the playing surface, and did visualisations before starting the fielding drills. Both he and Nair operated with a lot of intensity, and seeing the two in the XI will not come as a surprise.Then comes Kuldeep Yadav , and the only way the chinaman bowler can make his way into the playing XI is at the cost of a batter or an all-rounder. Both look very unlikely at this stage, and the think tank will look in that direction only if the pitch gives them a turning indication on the eve of the match. A lot to think, deliberate, and decide for the visitors, who need to register their first Test win at Old Trafford to stay alive in the five-Test series.","India are set to have their fourth different bowling combination of the series as injuries have forced them to make some tweaks.

England XI for 4th Test:

NEW DELHI: England have made one change to their playing XI for the fourth Test against India, bringing in slow left-arm orthodox spinner Liam Dawson in place of the injured Shoaib Bashir. The fourth Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy begins at Old Trafford, Manchester, on July 23, with England leading the five-match series 2-1.Bashir was ruled out of the remainder of the series after suffering a fracture to the index finger on his left hand. The injury occurred on Day 3 of the third Test at Lord’s, when he attempted to stop a fierce drive from India’s Ravindra Jadeja . Bashir later underwent surgery but will play no further part in the series.Despite the injury setback, the 20-year-old off-spinner played a pivotal role in England’s 22-run win at Lord’s, claiming the final wicket to seal victory and put the hosts ahead in the series.In Bashir’s absence, 35-year-old Dawson has earned a recall to the Test side. He last played a Test match in July 2017 — his third — against South Africa. Dawson returns on the back of consistent performances in county cricket and brings valuable experience with both bat and ball.Interestingly, Dawson has over 10,000 runs in first-class cricket — a milestone yet to be reached by any Indian batter in the current Test squad.Among India’s most experienced players, Karun Nair has 8,601 first-class runs, KL Rahul has 7,873, and Ravindra Jadeja has 7,850.England won the first Test at Headingley by five wickets, while India bounced back emphatically with a 336-run win at Edgbaston. The third Test at Lord’s went England’s way again, giving them a 2-1 lead heading into the crucial fourth encounter.Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope (vc), Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (c), Jamie Smith (wk), Liam Dawson, Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer.",England make one change to their playing XI for the fourth Test against India.

NEW DELHI: Sources from the World Champions of Legends (WCL) on Monday informed that the organisers had communicated to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) that they were unable to host the match, clarifying that the Indian team bore no responsibility for the cancellation. Ahead of the much-anticipated clash, the WCL released an official statement confirming that the India-Pakistan fixture at Edgbaston, Birmingham had been called off.

Following the incident, diplomatic ties between India and Pakistan deteriorated further.According to WCL sources, the Pakistan Champions team is unwilling to share points with their rivals, India Champions, asserting that the match was abandoned due to the Indian side’s withdrawal.Speaking about the development, WCL sources told ANI, ""WCL have conveyed to England and Wales Cricket Board that they, as organisers, were not able to conduct this match. The India Champions team are not at fault. Pakistan Champions team are not willing to share points because they are saying that it is India who backed out, not them.""Several Indian cricketers, including Suresh Raina and Shikhar Dhawan , confirmed to the media that they would not be taking part in the India-Pakistan game.

NEW DELHI: Vaibhav Suryavanshi once again drew attention in the second Youth Test between India U-19 and England U-19 at the County Ground in Chelmsford, though his cameo was brief this time.After a promising all-round show in the drawn first Test, the aggressive left-handed opener made headlines on Day 2 with a whirlwind start. Opening the innings with skipper Ayush Mhatre, Suryavanshi smashed 20 off just 14 balls, including one boundary and two towering sixes. However, his T20-style aggression didn’t yield a big score as he was dismissed by Alex Green with India U-19 at 37 — an early setback.Earlier in the day, England U-19 posted a competitive 309 in their first innings, built around a fighting century from Ekansh Singh. Resuming on his overnight score of 66, Singh went on to score a fluent 117 off 155 balls, laced with 14 fours and three sixes. He was the last wicket to fall, caught by Rahul Kumar off Vihaan Malhotra.Singh’s innings was instrumental in pushing England past 300. After his crucial 90-run sixth-wicket stand with captain Thomas Rew (59) on Day 1, he stitched together another 100-run partnership with No. 9 batter James Minto, who contributed 46 off 89 balls with one six and six fours.India’s bowlers toiled hard on a rain-hit day. Leg-spinner Naman Pushpak was the standout performer, finishing with 4 for 76. He broke the Singh-Minto partnership by dismissing Minto caught and bowled, and also removed Green. Aditya Rawat (2/64) and RS Ambrish (2/56) picked up two wickets each, while Henil Patel (1/56) and Vihaan Malhotra (1/4) chipped in with one apiece.In reply, India U-19 reached 51 for 1 at stumps, trailing by 258 runs. Mhatre was unbeaten on 20, alongside Malhotra on six. Only 28.3 overs were possible on Day 2 due to overnight and morning rain, followed by multiple interruptions throughout the day. Just 3.1 overs were bowled in the final session before play was called off.Suryavanshi, who impressed in the first Test with 56 off 44 balls and two wickets, will be keen to make a stronger impact in the second innings as the match progresses.","India U-19 reach 51 for 1 at stumps, trailing by 258 runs.

NEW DELHI: Former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar has thrown his weight behind India captain Shubman Gill , backing the young leader to bounce back in the fourth Test at Old Trafford, Manchester, with India trailing 1-2 in the series. While praising Gill’s leadership, Manjrekar also drew comparisons with former India skipper Virat Kohli , noting that Gill’s aggression differs from Kohli’s.Gill, known for his calm on-field demeanour, showed a rare flash of anger during the Lord’s Test when England opener Zak Crawley took too long to face a delivery, causing visible frustration in the Indian camp.Gill, clearly annoyed by the delay and interruptions, was caught on the stump mic shouting: ""Grow some f**** b***s.""Commenting on the incident, Manjrekar said on JioHotstar: “When Gill walked out to bat on Day 4, I expected England to give it back to him. After all, he had lost his temper earlier, and that’s part of the game. What disappointed me, though, was how it seemed to affect Shubman Gill. When something similar happened with Virat Kohli, he would get even more fired up and become a better batter. But with Gill, the effect wasn’t the same. He came out looking tentative.""Manjrekar further explained how the English players’ sledging may have played a role in Gill’s uncertain approach at the crease: ""Some of the sledging by English players included personal attacks.This might have been unfamiliar territory for Gill, especially considering that Indian players today often receive a friendly reception from touring sides. But Gill didn’t seem up for the challenge. The way he batted reflected that, and I have no doubt there’s a connection between the sledging and his uncertainty at the crease. ”Despite the criticism, Manjrekar remains optimistic about Gill’s overall progress and the road ahead: “Gill is a young captain, and he has already surpassed expectations, both with the bat and as a leader. The scoreline might be close, but India has won a Test match, and that’s credit to how he has gone about it. This eight-day break comes at a perfect time for him. He has good people around him, and his father, more than anyone, would know what kind of personality Shubman really is, whether he’s a potential Virat Kohli or Dhoni, or somewhere in between. """"I’m guessing somewhere in between. He has to find his own path now, a path that enhances both, his leadership and his batting. And, if there is anything coming in the way of either, he’s got to quickly let go of it. In the first Test, he was leaning heavily on Rishabh Pant and others. In the second, he started asserting himself, and the results followed. Now, after this little setback in the third Test, we might see the best of Shubman Gill, the captain, in Manchester. Hopefully, we’ll also see the best of Shubman Gill, the batter,” Manjrekar added.India, trailing 1-2 in the five-match Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, will look to level the series when the fourth Test begins at Old Trafford on July 23.","Former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar backs Shubman Gill to bounce back in the fourth Test at Old Trafford, Manchester.

India and England are set to face off once again in less than two days in the five-match Test series in England. With India trailing 2-1 and on the back of a painful defeat at Lord's, momentum is firmly with Ben Stokes' side. In a rather bold press conference for the hosts, Harry Brook spoke to the media ahead of the 4th Test at Old Trafford Cricket Ground.As the batter went over the moments of the heated 3rd Test and England's chances in the one that was set to follow, he made a strong claim about one of his teammates.Veteran batter and England icon Joe Root took top spot as the highest-ranked Test batter in the recent ICC rankings. Speaking on the same, Brook lauded his teammate and even went on to call him the ""best batter of all time.""Quizzed on whether there was any rivalry going on between himself and Root in the team, Brook was quick to dismiss it. ""Oh, everybody wants to be number one, don't they? Him, probably more than anybody else. But no, he's a phenomenal player. I'm not in the same league as him, so I'll happily let him have it,"" said Brook with a chuckle, as he spoke to the reporters ahead of the 4th Test.Adding to his argument on what makes Root so good, Brook said, ""He's played for 12, 13 years—or however long he's played.In my opinion, he's the best Test batter of all time, so I'll let him have that one.""Root also broke several records in the series, with one not being related to the bat as well. With his 211th catch in Test cricket, he now leads the list for catches taken in the format, bettering India legend Rahul Dravid’s record of 210. He took a splendid one-handed catch of Karun Nair in the 3rd Test.Root has been in impeccable form for the hosts, racking up crucial runs in the last three Tests. In the previous match at Lord's, the 34-year-old scored a gritty 104 off 199, and managed 40 in the second innings.Brook, however, failed to impress with the bat in both innings at Lord's, where he only managed 11 and 23 respectively. However, the hosts managed to get over the line and reestablish their series lead with a 22-run victory.The 4th Test will commence on July 23, with India looking to secure a win to stay alive in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.","Harry Brook spoke to the media ahead of the 4th Test at Old Trafford Cricket Ground.

India batter and former Test captain Rohit Sharma shared a set of heartwarming moments with his family on Instagram, offering fans a glimpse into his time off duty. The veteran opener, who retired from Test cricket in May, appeared relaxed and cheerful as he spent quality time with his wife and children.One of the photos shows Rohit walking hand-in-hand with his family on a street, while another captures him dressed casually in blue shorts and a floral-patterned shirt, enjoying the scenery. The post quickly went viral, racking up nearly a million likes within the first hour.According to multiple claims, Rohit is currently understood to be in London, where he's been unwinding following a hectic schedule.Earlier this year, the 38-year-old was lauded for his resilience during the ICC Champions Trophy, with former India selector Jatin Paranjape revealing that Rohit had been managing a hamstring injury throughout the tournament. Despite the physical challenge, Rohit led India to a title win, securing a four-wicket victory over New Zealand in the final.Speaking to the media, Paranjape said, “He could have — he should have — played a little bit more. I thought maybe for a couple more years. Rohit Sharma was also struggling with a hamstring injury for the last four or five months. He didn’t get a lot of rest. I thought he could have played a little more because he was batting superbly.”While he is no longer part of the Test setup, he will certainly be rooting for the Indian team, who are trailing 2-1 heading into the 4th Test of the five-match series vs England.","Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket in May.

England playing XI for fourth Test vs India:

Poll Is Liam Dawson's inclusion a good decision by the England selectors? Definitely Not sure No, they should have picked someone else

Harry Brook press conference: On why India are scared, on field fights at Lord's and more

England have confirmed one change to their playing XI for the fourth Test against India at Old Trafford, starting Wednesday. Hampshire all-rounder Liam Dawson replaces the injured Shoaib Bashir, marking his first Test appearance since July 2017.Dawson, a seasoned domestic performer, offers depth with both bat and ball on what is expected to be a spin-friendly surface in Manchester.Dawson steps in for Shoaib Bashir, who suffered a broken finger on his left hand during the first innings of last week's Lord's Test but showed great resilience by taking the final wicket to secure a 2-1 series lead for England. Bashir has since undergone surgery, with a wire inserted into his left pinkie to ensure proper healing. In Bashir's absence, Dawson will earn his fourth Test cap, with his last appearance dating back to July 2017 against South Africa.As a left-arm spinner, Dawson has claimed 371 first-class wickets. He has been particularly impressive in recent seasons, with 12 of his 15 five-wicket hauls—including three ten-wicket matches—coming since 2021. Since the start of the 2023 season, he has taken 124 wickets for Hampshire at an average of 25.64, complemented by 956 runs at 59.75, which earned him the prestigious men's PCA Player of the Year award last year.This summer, Dawson's performance includes 21 wickets at an average of 40.04, with an economy rate of 2.55, along with 536 runs at 44.66. Over the past five seasons, he has scored nine first-class centuries, including three in 2023 and three in 2024.His recent recall to the England squad marks a surprising turnaround, after seeming to have finished his international career. Earlier this summer, he returned to the T20I side after a three-year hiatus, delivering a notable performance of 4 for 20 against the West Indies in his comeback match, captained by England's newly appointed limited-overs captain, Harry Brook.""He's a wily, old fox,"" Brook said at Emirates Old Trafford on Monday. ""He's very experienced and a very skilful cricketer. He's played everywhere, played against everyone so hopefully he can have an amazing performance this week.""As we've seen over the Test series, the footholes have been for the left-handed batters outside off, so hopefully he can land it in the footholes and create a bit of spice and some opportunities to take wickets.""He's willing to always fight for the team, he's very competitive and it's good to have him here."" Zak Crawley , Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (c), Jamie Smith (wk), Liam Dawson, Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer.For India, the spotlight is on Anshul Kamboj, the 24-year-old right-arm pacer who could be in line for a memorable Test debut , as reported earlier by TimesofIndia.com.Called up as injury cover, Kamboj has had a whirlwind few days, joining the team on Saturday, meeting Manchester United players on Sunday, and bowling full tilt in Monday’s net session.He impressed the coaching staff, including Gautam Gambhir and Ajit Agarkar, with his accuracy and relentless line and length against top-order batters like KL Rahul, Shubman Gill, and Yashasvi Jaiswal.India’s pace attack has been hit by fitness issues, with Akash Deep still recovering from a groin strain and Arshdeep Singh ruled out due to a hand injury.This leaves Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Shardul Thakur, Prasidh Krishna, and Kamboj as the available seam options. Prasidh’s limited involvement with the new ball during practice hints at a possible debut for Kamboj.Meanwhile, Rishabh Pant has resumed wicketkeeping duties during practice, looking comfortable despite minor discomfort in his left hand.His return behind the stumps is a major boost for India. However, Akash Deep’s fitness test did not go as hoped, making his participation in the Test unlikely.",England confirm one change to playing XI for fourth Test against India.

Poll How do you rate Shubman Gill's performance as captain so far in the ongoing series? Good Average Poor

Australia Champions batter Shaun Marsh has praised Indian skipper Shubman Gill for his leadership during the ongoing India vs England Test series, saying the young captain has handled the pressure well. Marsh also highlighted the rise of young Indian cricketers and their impact on the team after the retirements of senior players.“Gill, who's taken over the captaincy. There was a lot of pressure on him coming into this series, and he's really stood up,” said Marsh.“You know, India's got so many talented cricketers who come out of their country. And I think we're seeing that now with the likes of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma retiring, these young players are coming in and stepping up. And it just goes to show how much potential and talent is in India at the moment,” the Australia Champions batter told ANI.Marsh is currently representing the Australia Champions side in the World Championship of Legends (WCL) 2025, which runs from July 18 to August 2 in the UK. The tournament features six iconic teams - India, Pakistan, Australia, England, South Africa, and West Indies—bringing together former international stars for a competitive T20 spectacle.Fellow Australia Champions player Ben Dunk reflected on the India vs Australia rivalry, calling it a strong and respectful one. “It is a very good rivalry… Two Cricket nations, who adore Cricket, who love Cricket and have a longstanding. It will be great to come up against them and it will be great to beat them, hopefully,” said Dunk.He believes Australia have a strong chance of going all the way in the tournament. “I am really confident, Australia has a pretty good record of putting their hands on trophies, and I see no reason why we can't follow on…”Marsh echoed the excitement, expressing hope that his side can go the distance this season. “Very excited. Hopefully, we can go two steps further this year and lift the cup this season,” added Marsh.The Australia Champions squad includes names like Brett Lee, Chris Lynn, Ben Cutting, and others, adding firepower and experience to their WCL 2025 campaign.","Shaun Marsh praises Indian skipper Shubman Gill for his leadership.

Harry Brook press conference: On why India are scared, on field fights at Lord's and more

Poll Who do you think was more responsible for the on-field tensions during the Lord’s Test? India's aggressive approach England's time-wasting

England batter Harry Brook has blamed the Indian team for the on-field tensions that escalated during the Lord’s Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, calling out India’s approach towards Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett late on Day 3 as the moment that lit the fuse.India, who were racing against time for another over before Stumps, were seen accusing Crawley of time-wasting. The tension flared when Shubman Gill and Mohammed Siraj confronted Crawley, while Gill also got into a heated moment with Duckett.Brook, speaking ahead of the fourth Test in Manchester, said the Indian players provoked the situation.“Yeah, we saw them guys going at Creeps (Zak Crawley) and Ducky (Ben Duckett), so we had a little chat and we thought we were a team, so we may as well combine with each other, get together and yeah, go back in there,” Brook told reporters.India eventually folded in their second innings, failing to chase 193 as England took a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. The atmosphere remained charged, especially on Day 4, when England’s Brydon Carse and captain Ben Stokes responded aggressively - Carse exchanged words with Akash Deep.Asked whether the aggressive reaction was good for the game, Brook said the public reaction was overwhelmingly positive.“I’ve had a lot of compliments, everybody said that it was awesome to watch and it looked like there was 11 versus 2 out there and we’re fielding and it was good fun.It was good fun. It was tiring, but yeah, it was good. It made fielding a lot more enjoyable,” he said.During the game, England batter Ben Duckett also took aim at Gill when he came out to bat, saying, ""600 runs and he is done for the series. 600 runs is enough for this fella.""Brook maintained that England were mindful of the line, but India’s response nudged them to respond.“Yeah, absolutely. And we’d try and play in the spirit of the game as much as possible. And like you said, them lads went hard and Creeps and Ducky on that night when they bowled that single over. So we watched that and we reassessed and we thought it was the right time to go back at them,” he added.","Harry Brook blames Indian team for on-field tensions at Lord's.

Poll Do you believe Arsenal will maintain their dominance in women's football with this signing? Definitely Maybe, but it's not guaranteed No, other teams are catching up

Arsenal have completed a historic £1 million transfer of Canadian forward Olivia Smith from Liverpool, marking the first seven-figure transfer in women's football. The 20-year-old's move to the European champions surpasses the previous record of £900,000 paid by Chelsea for American defender Naomi Girma from San Diego Wave in January.The milestone transfer comes 44 years after Trevor Francis became the first male player to command a million-pound fee when he moved from Birmingham City to Nottingham Forest in 1979. Arsenal secured Smith's services after successful negotiations with Liverpool, who initially were reluctant to let go of their player of the season.""It's my dream to compete for the biggest titles here in England and in Europe and I'm excited to get started and contribute to doing that here with Arsenal,"" Smith said in a statement.Smith demonstrated her value at Liverpool last season, scoring nine goals and earning the club's player of the season award despite the team's struggles. Her versatility allows her to play both as a forward and on the wing, making her an attractive signing for Arsenal.Arsenal's director of women's football, Clare Wheatley, expressed enthusiasm about the signing: ""We're thrilled to bring Olivia to Arsenal. She's one of the most talented young players in the game and has huge potential for further development here.""Smith's journey in football began with her becoming the youngest player to represent Canada at age 15. She then moved to Sporting Lisbon in 2023, where she scored 16 goals in 28 games before joining Liverpool.""It's a privilege and an honor to sign for Arsenal. The atmosphere the supporters create at Emirates Stadium is incredible and I can't wait to have that behind me now,"" Smith stated.The transfer represents Arsenal's ambition to strengthen their position in women's football, following their Champions League victory. The club, which holds the distinction of being the most decorated in English women's football, has also secured the services of winger Chloe Kelly, Taylor Hinds, and Anneke Borbe on free transfers for the upcoming season.Liverpool, who finished seventh last season, plan to use the transfer fee to reinforce their squad. The record-breaking transfer signifies Arsenal's intent to maintain their dominance in the league while setting a new benchmark for women's football transfers.The transfer marks a significant moment in the development of women's football, establishing a new financial milestone that reflects the growing investment and commercial value in the women's game.

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

PANAJI: Three months after the All India Football Federation (AIFF) declared Churchill Brothers FC as the I-League winners and hastily handed over the trophy during a ceremony in Goa, the federation announced Inter Kashi FC as the new champions on Friday.The announcement follows orders from the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), after the Switzerland-based tribunal set aside the AIFF appeals committee decision, which had adjudged that the re-registration of Mario Barco by the Varanasi-based club made him an ineligible player. Points were forfeited following a protest by three clubs – Churchill Brothers, Namdhari and Real Kashmir -- leaving them lower in the table.The CAS panel, an independent international body that settles disputes related to sport through arbitration, however set aside the appeals committee decision issued on May 31 and ordered AIFF to “adjust the points table of the I-League and declare Inter Kashi as champions.”The final points table leaves Kashi at the top with 42 points, two more than second-placed Churchill.Real Kashmir finished third with 37 points.“We won on the pitch, fair and square, but many could not accept that,” said club president Prithijit Das. “Our club is barely two years old, which played the I-League with heart and grit. Maybe because we weren’t part of the old order, false cases were filed, our integrity questioned, our name dragged. We didn’t give up. We went all the way to CAS, fought steadily, and won.”Significantly, this was the second win for Kashi at CAS in as many months after the Swiss body had previously overturned the appeals committee decision of taking away three points that were awarded by the disciplinary committee as Namdhari fielded an ineligible player (Cledson da Silva)“This win is not just ours. It’s a reminder of what sport should stand for; passion, fairness, and honesty, not politics,” said Das.AIFF was quick to readjust the league points table and officially declare Kashi as the new champions.“CAS has ruled that the AIFF shall declare Inter Kashi as winners of the I-League 2024-25. The AIFF congratulates Inter Kashi on being adjudged champions,” AIFF said in a statement.With the CAS order and AIFF’s statement, the I-League title race has now finally concluded, more than three months after the teams had played the last round of matches. On the final day, Churchill had their chances to settle the race on the ground itself but only ended up drawing 1-1 against Real Kashmir in Srinagar.Kashi, who were almost out of the race, turned the standings on its head after scoring twice in four stoppage-time minutes for a 3-1 win against Rajasthan United. The players celebrated at their home ground, believing they had come from behind not just for a win but also a memorable triumph.“It was a very difficult time for everyone at the club but in the end, victory is ours. We have won not just the I-League title, but our name and respect as well,” said Das.","Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) overturns AIFF decision to declare Churchill Brothers the I-League champions.

Why was the ban imposed in first place?

Poll What is your main concern regarding the return of away fans? Increased violence and incidents Allocation of police resources General public safety

Argentina's football federation has announced plans to gradually lift a 12-year ban on away fans in local leagues, which was originally implemented to curb stadium violence but proved ineffective.The first test of this new policy will occur during the Clausura tournament's second matchday when Lanús hosts Rosario Central.""It's a day that marks a before and after in our league,"" Argentine Football Association president Claudio Tapia said. ""It's the kind of football (with visitors) we all grew accustomed to since we were kids. We have to get back to that path. Clubs that are in a position to host visiting fans can do so.""The ban was initiated in 2013 following two tragic incidents: a Lanús fan's death during a police intervention in a clash with Estudiantes supporters, and the deaths of two Boca Juniors fans in a faction-related shootout.The restriction began in Buenos Aires province before expanding nationwide. However, violence persisted with continued deaths among ""barrabravas"" groups.Under the new protocol, 6,500 Rosario Central supporters will be permitted in the Lanús away section. The plan includes strict security measures and designated tickets for proper fan identification.""The idea isn't to go back to what we had before because the visitors were kicked out for a reason,"" Buenos Aires security minister Javier Alonso said. ""We have to eradicate the culture of violence. It's sad to see 10-year-olds singing about drugs or that someone needs to be killed. It has to be a family celebration, with flags and drums.""The initial implementation will be limited to Buenos Aires province, though other provinces have expressed interest in joining the initiative.The plan has faced opposition from some quarters in Buenos Aires. Critics argue that allocating police resources to protect visiting fans could compromise general public security amid rising crime concerns.The away fan restriction only applied to professional league matches and other divisions in Argentina, while international tournaments like Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana continued to allow visiting supporters.""This is what football fans and society want. Many matches have been organised with two sets of fans, and that's why we decided to announce the start of the return of visiting fans,"" Tapia added.",Argentina's football federation has announced plans to gradually lift a 12-year ban on away fans in local leagues.

Other Formula E initiatives

Formula E has several initiatives running under its sustainability campaign. Among them is a youth education program called Driving Force, supported by PIF E360. It aims to teach children between the ages of 8 and 18 about science, technology, and sustainability. The goal is to reach over 50,000 students worldwide by the end of 2025.The Driving Force initiative comes at a time when there is expected to be a massive demand for 200,000 skilled workers in the UK for green jobs by 2030, according to PwC.Driving Force helps students learn about clean energy and the environment. It also introduces them to role models from the fields of science and technology, helping them gain the knowledge and confidence needed to consider careers in these areas. These workshops use fun and practical activities to show how what students learn in school can lead to exciting real-world careers in racing, clean energy, engineering, and more.On July 16, over 90 students participated in Formula E’s Driving Force workshop at Hammersmith Academy in London. The session was one of five workshops held at schools across London in July, near the London E-Prix race site in East London and Formula E’s headquarters in Hammersmith.Earlier this year, similar workshops were also held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and Miami, USA, during Formula E race weeks.Julia Pallé, VP of Sustainability at Formula E, said, ""A survey in 2024 of more than 7,000 UK secondary school students reveals a worrying downward trend in both their involvement in and their ambition to pursue STEM subjects — a stark wake-up call for educators and policymakers alike.""""Teachers are being asked to make stronger connections between subjects and careers, but they need support from employers to do that effectively. Driving Force, presented by PIF E360, is part of the solution to help the education system deliver what our students and our green economy both desperately need to succeed,” she added.Also Read: Taylor Barnard overtakes Antonio Felix Da Costa in Berlin to claim 3rd in Formula E Driver Standings Formula E’s broader social impact strategy includes several other initiatives such as FIA Girls on Track, the Better Futures Fund, and Inspiration Hour.

It’s not unusual for teams to introduce new designs for special Formula E races, be it for livery or driver suits. While Nissan’s cherry blossom livery at the Tokyo E-Prix was a hit and now NEOM McLaren will be racing in a striking white and blue livery, the Lola Yamaha ABT team did something absolutely unexpected at the Berlin E-Prix.

Apparently it was the year of “2nd places”. Seems like I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time too often. 3 wins lost in the last laps because of safety cars, a few mistakes my mixture, the season could have been so different, but that's what it is in sport, and the bad moments, if used well, are the best thing we have.

Oliver Rowland’s journey in Formula E was full of ups and downs

Oliver Rowland shares his happiness on Formula E championship win

Things weren’t always well-planned for Oliver Rowland, who has just clinched the Formula E World Championship. The 32-year-old Nissan driver took major risks throughout his career, including walking away from a team without another offer in hand. He describes that time as one of the toughest periods of his life. But Rowland eventually bounced back, joining a new team and going on to win the championship this season.Oliver Rowland made his one-race debut in Formula E with Mahindra Racing at the 2015 Punta del Este ePrix, replacing the injured Nick Heidfeld. He quickly disappeared from the scene afterward.Reflecting on that strange start in Formula E’s second season, Rowland told Formula E’s official website, “If you go back to Punta del Este, I remember having no idea about anything when I arrived and leaving thinking, ‘I'm not sure I want to do that again, because it was pretty tough.’”He eventually returned as a full-time Formula E driver with Nissan e.dams in 2018. After delivering notable performances over a few seasons, he switched to Mahindra Racing in 2021. However, midway through the 2023 season, Rowland made another bold move — quitting the team without a confirmed offer elsewhere. Nissan brought him back the following season, leading to two remarkable years that culminated in him winning the Season 11 championship.Speaking about his decision to leave Mahindra Racing in 2023 after two seasons, Rowland said, “I took a huge risk for my career and for my family because my contract is what keeps us all fed and watered, so walking away from that was a really, really tough period in my life. I remember not sleeping for like, two, three weeks at some point. To kind of write the story and come out on the other side with the team that I started in Formula E with is just perfect. ”He added, “As a racing driver, a lot of days are bad, and you have to keep believing in yourself — that you're capable of doing it. Going into this year, I was confident that we would have a good chance.”Now, Oliver Rowland has become the Formula E World Champion in just his second year back with Nissan. “The moment I arrived in the championship and looked at the caliber of drivers here and the previous World Champions, it's such a good achievement for me to become World Champion. To be part of that is incredible,” he said.Also Read: Oliver Rowland’s rise to champion: Rare childhood moments highlighted in touching video Rowland will now race in front of his home crowd in London, where he’ll lift the World Championship trophy.

How Taylor Barnard surpassed Antonio Felix Da Costa in Driver Standings

This is 21-year-old Taylor Barnard’s first full-fledged season as a rookie driver, and the NEOM McLaren racer has achieved what many of his peers couldn’t. At the recently held Berlin E-Prix, Barnard put up a strong performance on the track, managing to surpass Antonio Felix Da Costa and take the third spot in the standings. With two races remaining, Barnard still has a chance to overtake Pascal Wehrlein for the second place.Taylor Barnard outperformed TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix Da Costa in Berlin. Da Costa, who had been comfortably sitting in third, has now slipped to fourth in the standings.Taking to Instagram to reflect on his Berlin performance, Barnard wrote, “Reflecting on Berlin. Definitely a weekend of what could have been, but we scored good points across both races, closing the gap to P2 in the standings. An unfortunately timed SC on Sunday cost us the chance of going for the win, but we will maximise our efforts to go into London as strong as possible.Taylor Barnard finished fourth in Round 13 and sixth in Round 14 race at the Berlin E-Prix, collecting a total of 20 points. In comparison, Da Costa finished 10th and 8th in the two races, scoring just 5 points — enabling Barnard to leap ahead of him in the standings.Currently, Oliver Rowland has sealed the Formula E Championship title with 184 points.Pascal Wehrlein holds second place with 125 points, while Barnard trails closely behind with 112. A strong performance in London could be enough for Barnard to overtake Wehrlein and claim second place in the championship.So far this season, Barnard has secured five podium finishes — one each in Sao Paulo, Tokyo, and Shanghai, and two in Jeddah — though he is yet to clinch his first Formula E race win.Barnard will now race on home soil in London alongside his McLaren teammate Sam Bird. The duo will sport a new blue-and-white livery and race suits.

Oliver Rowland was worried after how Round 13 turned out in Berlin

Formula E Berlin Round 14 – 60‑Second Blitz!

Pascal Wehrlein’s Round 14 performance sealed Oliver Rowland’s championship win

Oliver Rowland looking forward to his home race now



Oliver Rowland’s fans kept their fingers crossed and waited with bated breath for the Nissan driver to seal his Formula E World Championship at the Round 13 race in Berlin on Saturday. But the day ended on a sad note for the driver as he failed to even finish the race, while his closest competitor, Pascal Wehrlein, clinched second spot on the podium, closing the gap between them in the Formula E Driver Standings. Rowland has confirmed that he did doubt his championship win when things didn’t play out well that day.There was reason to be worried for Nissan driver Oliver Rowland when TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein closed the gap between them in the Driver Standings to 50 points. He was second in the Formula E Driver Standings and could have changed the championship outcome with two more races remaining in the season.Sharing his fears in an interview with Formula E, he said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday) I was more worried that it might never come.”Pascal Wehrlein ended 15th in the Round 14 race on Sunday despite starting from pole position.Rowland eventually bounced back to finally seal his championship win by finishing fourth in the race. He missed out on the podium, which had Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy as the winner, but his 12 points, along with his closest competitor Pascal Wehrlein’s disappointing performance, were enough for him to clinch the championship.“I wasn't aware of where Pascal was at all. My engineer came on, I think with four or five laps to go, and said ‘P4 is good,’ and I thought that's a bit weird. Then I looked at the TV screen, and I got to about eighth, and I thought, ‘Oh, he's not in the top eight then.’ The next time I came around looking again, I found him when I started from the bottom. I didn't know if he'd had a problem, so then I was aware that fourth would be enough if Wehrlein didn't score, so I knew that myself. I didn't want to ask, because I didn't want to jinx anything,” he said.Oliver Rowland took to Instagram on Wednesday to share a post to mark his Formula E Championship win. Sharing a few pictures of his celebrations with his team, the Nissan driver wrote: “2025 FIA FORMULA E WORLD CHAMPION! It still hasn’t quite sunk in what we have achieved this season. I couldn’t have imagined being in this position 2 years ago! Thank you to my incredible team @nismo & everyone that’s supported me!

Jake Dennis is steadily climbing the ladder back to form. The Andretti driver secured second place on the podium in Round 14 of the Formula E race at the Berlin E-Prix on Sunday. This marked his second podium of the season, following his third-place finish in Monaco. Dennis shared his thoughts after the race in Berlin, which also saw Nissan driver Oliver Rowland clinch the Formula E World Championship title.Just a day earlier, Dennis had retired from Round 13 due to technical issues with his car. He had also come close to claiming his first win of the season in Jakarta last month after starting from pole position, but an unfortunate collision with Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries cost him the victory.Things finally aligned for him on Sunday at the Berlin E-Prix, as he capitalized on an Attack Mode overlap to secure second place. The race was won by Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy, while DS Penske’s Jean-Eric Vergne finished third.Sharing a picture of the champagne celebrations on the podium at the Tempelhof Airport Circuit, Dennis wrote on Instagram: “P2!! Awesome race for us and perfectly executed! Great job by the whole team! A moment to say congrats to @oliverrowland1! So happy for you mate, world class all year! World champion looks good on you!”Speaking after the race, Dennis reflected on his recent struggles, having finished 17th in consecutive races leading up to Berlin.“We had a really good race car and the strategy we took into the race was perfectly executed. I had every opportunity to win this race, and we got pretty close. I’m not too surprised to be up here — I’m just super happy for myself and for the team. We’ve been on a real bad luck streak recently, so to reward them with a P2 is the least I could do,” he said.Looking ahead to his home race in London, which also serves as the Season 11 Formula E finale, Dennis said, “I’m excited to have this little boost going into the final stretch, my home race in London. It’s needed. It’s more for morale. Oliver [Rowland] has already won the championship, so massive congratulations to him. I’m super happy for him, he’s a good friend of mine.”Also Read: Nick Cassidy on Berlin E-Prix win: “I don’t want to take the moment from Oliver Rowland” Jake Dennis currently sits tenth in the 2025 Formula E Drivers' Standings with 77 points.

We kind of knew we screwed up in qualifying, and I was a bit upset about that, but the car during the race was fantastic—it was awesome. That’s three wins here now. This place didn’t used to be kind to me, but it’s become an amazing venue for me over the years, so it's really cool to have won here for three consecutive years.We’ve been improving all season—it’s no secret that Jaguar is back.

Pascal Wehrlein clinches podium in Berlin Round 13

Pascal Wehrlein fights to secure his position in Formula E Driver Standings

It was a special day for German driver Pascal Wehrlein at his home race, the Berlin E-Prix, on Saturday. Despite facing a three-place grid penalty, the TAG Heuer Porsche driver delivered a stellar performance to reach the podium. Wehrlein, driving car No. 94, finished second in Round 13 at the Tempelhof Airport Circuit and celebrated the moment with his daughter on stage.Pascal Wehrlein secured his fifth podium of the season at the Berlin E-Prix on Saturday, overcoming a grid penalty received for colliding with teammate Antonio Felix Da Costa during FP1 on Friday. He also earned extra points for setting the fastest lap in the race.After the event, Wehrlein shared several photos on Instagram, including a heartwarming one of him holding his daughter. He captioned it: “I promised you a trophy. P2 at our first home race of the season. Grateful to have family and friends here to share the moment. Let’s go again tomorrow.”The achievement was even sweeter as it helped Wehrlein close the gap with championship leader Oliver Rowland to just 50 points. Rowland failed to finish Saturday’s race and retired early. However, on Sunday, fortunes reversed — Wehrlein couldn’t convert his pole position into a podium, while Rowland finished fourth, securing enough points to clinch this year’s Formula E World Championship.Sharing his thoughts after the Round 13 race, Wehrlein said, “It was an important day and a good race, starting from P9. Finishing second is a good result, but we had a small taste of the victory. I think pace-wise, we were the quickest, so I tried really hard and it was close in the end. I think we can be happy with today, good points for the team, good points for the championship. Every race is all-in and we try to maximise every one. ”His second-place finish also gave a crucial boost to TAG Heuer Porsche in the Teams’ and Manufacturers’ Championship.Following Sunday’s race, where Pascal Wehrlein failed to score and Oliver Rowland picked up 12 points, Wehrlein remains second in the Formula E Drivers’ Standings with 125 points. While he can no longer catch Rowland, he will need a strong finish in the remaining rounds to protect his position.

If

How do you, when beaten to the ground, bruised and busted, get back on your feet? Jannik Sinner knows.The 23-year-old wore his pain plainly in Paris, seated at his court side space, having finished at the wrong end of the five-hour 29-minute epic against Carlos Alcaraz.Five weeks later, on a dazzling Sunday in July, he punctuated a five-match losing streak against his arch nemesis, and brought a rivalry to life on Wimbledon ’s lawns. No tennis player has crossed the channel with greater purpose than Sinner, turning the Paris heartbreak to a memorable hurrah, his fourth Major title, and first in this leafy London suburb.The mental miles the 23-year-old Italian covered in the five weeks must anoint him as the sport’s newest mentalist.On the wall of the players’ entrance to Centre Court are the words from, a Rudyard Kipling poem: “If you can meet with triumph and disaster/ And treat those two impostors just the same.”In terms of expression, Sinner doesn’t give much away, no passionate celebration like Alcaraz on Paris’ red clay, just a smile that sparked his eyes. The turnaround was scripted during a stretch that features a diabolic switch of surfaces, from stubborn red clay to slick grass.It was when the Italian picked himself up, and in washing away the stains of squandering three successive match points, he underlined the size of his fight.There were big questions surrounding Sinner’s morale coming into Wimbledon. “This is the part I’m the proudest of because it has not been easy,” said Sinner, who tried to take positives from his loss in Paris. “It’s much better that you lose a Grand Slam final that way than someone kills you, you make two games.”The Italian’s coaches — Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi — discussed Roland Garros threadbare with Sinner for about 24 hours after the final but didn’t bring it up again thereafter.“For us it was important to move forward as quickly as possible,” Cahill said. “The week leading to Wimbledon was the best practice week we’ve ever had as far as attitude and form. We knew we had something special coming in. We knew that he had already put Roland Garros behind him. He was playing with real purpose. You could see that from the first match that he played, he wasn’t carrying any baggage from Roland Garros.”Following his win on Sunday, the world No. 1 leaves London with a hefty 3,430-point lead over Alcaraz.Sinner’s struggles of the last six months — when he served a three-month doping ban (February to May) for testing positive for anabolic agent clostebol — included the reactions of the locker room, most of who weren’t supportive of the Italian. A large section of the players thought the four-time Major winner had been treated favourably, add to that the vitriol directed at him on social media, and he was wading through murky waters.The 23-year-old, a methodical creature, turned to work, shrugging the weight off his shoulders. “We’ve tried to push at every practice session, I was struggling at times mentally,” Sinner explained. “Maybe even more in practice sessions because I feel when I play the match, I can switch off and just play.”Sinner’s win on Sunday was significant as much for himself as for this young rivalry. While the Italian is obviously too good a player to never beat the Spaniard again, the five successive losses across a near two-year stretch was beginning to gnaw. Sinner said, “When you lose several times against someone, it’s not easy.”Cahill pinned Sinner’s victory to the details. “You saw a bit more energy from him in the big moments, a bit more focus to knuckle down and make sure that when he had his nose in front, he kept on closing the door against Carlos,” the Aussie said.Vagnozzi added, “He was brave today, in the important moments he was really brave.”Alcaraz, the charismatic Spaniard, now leads the rivalry 8-5, but these numbers become irrelevant on the court where the margins are infinitesimal. Also, Sinner and Alcaraz are a level above the rest of the field.“Our level is really high, we don’t watch a level like this when other players are playing against each other,” Alcaraz said. “This rivalry is becoming better and better. We’re building a really great rivalry, we’re playing in the finals of Grand Slams, Masters, the best tournaments in the world. It’s going to get better and better.”That’s the bargain the Italian spent a little over three hours on Sunday signing on.",Jannik Sinner beat Carlos Alcaraz to win Wimbledon men's singles title. Italian had lost five matches in a row against his arch nemesis. The 23-year-old won his fourth Major title and first in London.

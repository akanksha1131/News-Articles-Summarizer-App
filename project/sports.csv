Poll Do you think the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy has been a successful series? Yes, absolutely No, it could have been better

Former England captain Nasser Hussain has slammed the ""pitches"" and ""scheduling"" of the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy but lauded the performance of both teams, saying ""Test cricket needed a series like this.""""This series has been feisty and played with a bit of needle, and I like that,” he wrote in Daily Mail.“In general, the fight between the teams has made it much more watchable. It has been great TV,” Hussain added.“We talked at the start of the summer about two iconic series coming up for England — India at home and then Australia away. When you build a series up, sometimes it can be a bit one-sided and deflating. But this has not disappointed, and I think Test cricket needed a series like this.”Hussain then went on to highlight some of the standout moments of the series.""There have been so many memorable moments. There was that over to Zak Crawley on the last night at Lord’s. You had Pant strolling down the stairs on one leg at Old Trafford, hobbling around as he batted with a broken foot.""Here at The Oval, we saw Joe Root — the most mild-mannered, calm individual — losing his cool after some verbals from Prasidh Krishna . Then there was Sai Sudharsan, another calm character, walking into the England huddle and having words with Duckett.I have enjoyed every single minute of it,” he said.On the pitches and the schedule, the ex-England captain remarked: “The only downsides have been the pitches and the schedule. Make no mistake, this series needed this Oval pitch. Although every Test has gone to the last session, the conditions have slightly favoured the bat too much. Here, the ball has dominated the bat just enough to make it an incredibly watchable match.”""As for the schedule, five Tests in six weeks is too tight, and the dates have also been odd. I agreed with Ben Stokes when he questioned why there have been two long turnarounds of eight or nine days between Tests, and then two short ones of just three days. It would be better to have a consistent five-day break between them all,” he added.","Former England captain Nasser Hussain has slammed the ""pitches"" and ""scheduling"" of the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.

Poll What is your prediction for the outcome of the fifth Test at The Oval? India will win England will win It will end in a draw Too close to call

India’s premier fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah was ruled out of the fifth and final Test against England at The Oval, not for workload management, as initially speculated, but due to a knee injury. A report in Mumbai Mirror has confirmed that the decision was precautionary in nature.The BCCI, in its July 31 release, simply stated: “Bumrah has been released from India’s squad for the fifth Test of the series against England.”No mention of an injury was made at the time, prompting questions and criticism from some quarters.However, a BCCI official clarified the situation, saying: “Unfortunately, Bumrah is suffering from a knee injury. The good thing is that it’s not a major one and won’t require surgery. The BCCI medical team is currently awaiting his scan reports.”The 31-year-old speedster is expected to begin his rehabilitation at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence (CoE).Despite missing the final match, Bumrah had a strong series, claiming 14 wickets in three matches at an average of 26.00, including two five-wicket hauls. His most notable spell came in the fourth Test at Old Trafford, where he toiled for 33 overs on a flat pitch and returned figures of 2/112.Bumrah’s absence in the crucial final Test stirred debate, especially given his injury history. After a long layoff due to a back stress fracture earlier this year, sustained during the New Year’s Test in Sydney, this knee issue marks a fresh fitness concern.Looking ahead, Bumrah's availability for the upcoming Asia Cup (starting September 9 in the UAE) and the October Test series against the West Indies remains uncertain, with updates expected soon.Meanwhile, England edged closer to a series win on Sunday.On Day 4 at The Oval, Joe Root (105) and Harry Brook (111) stitched a 195-run partnership, helping England reach 339/6, just 35 runs shy of their target.","Jasprit Bumrah ruled out of the fifth and final Test against England at The Oval.

American Grandmaster (GM) Hans Niemann has ignited fresh controversy in the chess world with a striking statement on social media, contrasting India’s growing support for chess talent with what he claims is a deeply flawed system in the United States.“The Indian government and chess federation treats their players like superstars: supporting their development from an early age and rewarding them for their victories.

As the fifth and final Test between India and England heads into its last day at The Oval, England stand on the brink of a series-clinching victory.Needing just 35 more runs with four wickets in hand, the hosts are firm favourites to close out a 3-1 win. Meanwhile, India require a near-miracle to turn the match around and level the series.Rain and bad light brought an early end to play on Day 4, with England cruising at 339/6, thanks to a dominant 195-run partnership between Joe Root (105) and Harry Brook (111). The pair dismantled India’s bowling attack and made the target of 374 look well within reach.Reacting to the match situation and India’s overall performance in the series, legendary cricketer Sunil Gavaskar didn’t mince his words during a discussion on Sony Sports Network.“Overall, if you add up all the games, it’s a bit like that - one team has won more games, the other more sets,” Gavaskar said, drawing a tennis analogy to compare match outcomes with momentum shifts.He added firmly: “You could say that, but at the end of the day, it’s the result that matters. Unless India win this game and level the series, you have to admit that England are the better team. It doesn’t matter how many sessions you’ve won.”It’s a sobering assessment for an Indian side that has shown flashes of dominance throughout the series but struggled to sustain pressure when it mattered most.With only one day left and little margin for error, India will need a sensational bowling performance or some help from the weather to salvage a draw.",England are on the brink of a series-clinching victory at The Oval.

Poll Will India's bowlers successfully exploit the pitch conditions at The Oval? Yes, they have the skills No, the conditions are too challenging

With Day 4 of the fifth Test underway at The Oval, India are pressing hard for a series-levelling victory against England. As the tension builds, former India head coach Ravi Shastri offered sharp insight into how Indian bowlers can exploit the pitch to maximum effect.Speaking to former Australia international Mel Jones ahead of the day’s play, Shastri pointed out the key areas Indian bowlers should target.""I think Gautam Gambhir should just get his bowlers here, just show them these dents. X marks as well. Marks there, and just say: focus on that area. You know that's where you've got to be 80% of the time. The pitch will do the rest,"" said Shastri while inspecting the surface on Sky Sports Cricket.Unlike the flat tracks seen earlier in the series, this one has a generous covering of grass. Shastri emphasised the difference in playing conditions, saying, ""As opposed to Leeds, this has a lot more grass on the surface, so things will happen a lot quicker. England chased down the score at Leeds. If they come even closer, I think they've done twice the job of what they did in Leeds, because this is not easy.""He underlined the difficulty of the task England face in chasing down a steep target, while maintaining it’s not beyond reach.""It will require—they’ll have to bat out of their skins to pull off something special here. This will be twice the effort of what they put in. Not impossible. Not impossible. The first session becomes crucial, where they don't lose more than a wicket.""England started steadily before Mohammad Siraj struck late in the morning session with a searing yorker that removed Zak Crawley right at the 50-run mark. With more than 300 still to get, India remain in the driver’s seat.Mel Jones, who accompanied Shastri during the pitch inspection, also noted the surface’s unpredictable nature.""We've been having a look at this pitch. It's definitely dented. Is that what's causing that extra bounce, do you think? Hugely so... What we've seen though is when it has hit those dents, it's kicked,"" she observed.With the surface deteriorating and pressure mounting, Shastri’s tactical pointers may prove pivotal in India's final push.",Ravi Shastri has pointed out what India can use to their advantage at The Oval.

Tensions were high on Day 4 of the fifth Test at The Oval as India’s bowlers struggled to contain a surging England batting lineup. Captain Shubman Gill , clearly feeling the pressure, was heard on the stump mic urging injured pacer Akash Deep to return to action in a moment that’s since gone viral.Earlier in the day, Akash Deep took a painful blow to the shin when Harry Brook smashed a straight drive that struck the bowler flush on his right leg.Akash went down immediately, clutching his shin in agony. Though he managed to finish his over, it was clear he wasn’t at full fitness.Post-lunch, with England gaining momentum and spin not offering much, Gill was desperate to rotate his seamers.After Washington Sundar’s short spell failed to make an impact, Gill looked toward Akash again. That’s when the stump mic captured him saying: ""Injection liya kya tum?""Watch:He was asking whether Akash had taken a painkiller injection to get back into the attack. He repeated it for emphasis, underscoring India’s urgency as England chased down a steep target of 374.Meanwhile, England's batters continued to dominate.

Pakistan secured a thrilling 13-run win over the West Indies in the third and final T20I at Lauderhill, Florida on Sunday, sealing the series 2-1 after a strong opening partnership from Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub laid the foundation for victory.Opting to bat first, Pakistan posted a commanding 189/4, thanks to a 138-run opening stand between Farhan and Ayub. Farhan smashed 74 off 53 balls with five sixes and three fours, while Ayub contributed a steady 66 off 49 balls.Late wickets slowed Pakistan's charge, with Mohammad Haris (2), Hasan Nawaz (15), and Ayub himself falling in the final overs.Chasing 190, West Indies started aggressively but faltered under pressure. Jewel Andrew (24) and Alick Athanaze (60) kept them in the hunt, but key dismissals—including captain Shai Hope for 7 and last-match hero Jason Holder for a duck—derailed the innings. Sherfane Rutherford’s fighting 51 off 31 balls wasn’t enough, as the hosts finished short at 176/9.Saim Ayub shone with both bat and ball, also picking up the key wicket of Athanaze. Prasidh Krishna took three wickets for Pakistan, effectively sealing the win.However, the victory came amid injury concerns for Pakistan. Star batter Fakhar Zaman missed the decider and has been ruled out of the upcoming three-match ODI series due to a left hamstring strain sustained while fielding in the second T20I.A follow-up assessment confirmed a minor strain, and he is set to return to Pakistan on August 4 for rehab at the National Cricket Academy in Lahore. His replacement for the ODIs is yet to be named.This is Fakhar’s second injury setback of the year. Earlier, he was ruled out of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 after a muscular strain, ironically replacing Saim Ayub at the time, who had also been recovering from injury.","Pakistan beat West Indies by 13 runs in the third and final T20I at Lauderhill.

Poll Do you think India can level the series at 2-2? Yes, they will No, England will win It's too close to call

Team India’s bowling coach Morne Morkel praised Mohammed Siraj for his consistent performances in the five-match Test series against England. Siraj featured in all five games and has emerged as India’s leading wicket-taker in the series with 20 scalps to his name.Defending a target of 374 in the final Test, Siraj bowled with intensity and discipline, putting England’s batters under pressure. Though he has taken two wickets so far in the innings, his impact has been significant.He has bowled 26 overs so far in this innings — the highest among Indian bowlers. Akash Deep has bowled 20 overs, while Prasidh Krishna has delivered 22 overs.“Akash didn’t get it right today, but hopefully he produces a magic spell. I’m happy Siraj is getting recognition — he’s a natural leader,” Morkel said during the post-day press conference.England reached 339/6 at stumps on Day 4 after rain and bad light brought an early end to proceedings at The Oval. They need just 35 more runs to clinch a 3-1 series win. Jamie Smith (2*) and Jamie Overton (0*) are the unbeaten batters at the crease.India, meanwhile, require four wickets — potentially just three if Chris Woakes is unable to bat due to his shoulder injury — to level the series 2-2.Woakes, who was seen with his arm in a sling on Sunday, might only bat one-handed if he’s needed and will likely come in at No. 11.“The series had moments like that — ups and downs. We managed to break the partnership. Unfortunately, the rain came in, and we’ll come back tomorrow. You can’t afford to throw in the towel. The key was to break that partnership and create a bit of pressure,” Morkel said.“It’s pretty wet out there. The ground staff has been incredible with the breaks and all… it’s out of our control.

Poll Was the dramatic one-hour session a turning point for India in the match? Yes, it boosted their morale No, it was too late It created more pressure

: It was absolute theatre in the final session of Day 4. It had everything. Almost every delivery became an event. Both India seamers Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna ran in hard and there was an appeal for almost everything which they bowled. The capacity crowd at The Oval became animated, got behind the visitors who were just about hanging on. Joe Root's wicket, Jacob Bethell's rash shot gave them plenty to believe in fading night and they bowled their heart out in what was a very challenging period to survive for hosts England.Very few found the middle of the blade and India felt interested in every delivery which wrapped on the pads, found the edge or beat it. There were loud shouts, oohs and aahs, and suddenly the straight-forward result, something that looked a mere formality before the session began. Only 57 to get, Root and Bethell in the middle and Jamie Smith and bowlers to follow. Lots of batting, not many runs after a dominating session meant England were well ahead but that one hour spiced things up before it suddenly became dark and there was a heavy enough downpour that warranted covering the entire square.Before the late theatrics, two moments before the Tea break summed up India's most of the day. First ball of the 65th over, a not-so-100% Akash Deep put in some extra effort into his length delivery which Jacob Bethell lobbed up into the air. All Akash had to do was take a few steps back and complete what could have been a regulation catch. He turned to take a few steps but lost balance, possibly due to the shoe getting stuck, and the ball dropped right in front of him. He was on the ground, Siraj tried to get there but couldn't and the sense of helplessness in the middle reflected in the body language of the Indian players.England were in cruise control at 307/4 and a luckless India continued to toil without the rub of the green going their way. In the very next over, Siraj put in his extra effort on an in-dipper which crashed into Joe Root's pads but umpire Kumar Dharamasena was unmoved. To the naked eye, impact seemed outside off but Shubman Gill rolled another desperate dice to see the back of England's rock. The DRS confirmed the impact, Root survived and the helplessness continued.When the day got underway, the odds were heavily stacked in India's favour on what was the liveliest pitch of the series. The ball had been doing something right through the first three days and even though England had chased 371 in the series opener at Headingley, The Oval pitch was going to be the toughest examination for the English batters.India came hard in the morning session, better prepared with smart fielding plans to keep Ben Duckett quiet, picked two early wickets and clearly looked like getting at least two more.Siraj was steaming in, making things happen but the wickets column didn't quite reflect the kind of rhythm he was in the morning session. Batting had been better after the heavy roller in the morning but India had their plans chalked out. They kept the 'Bazballers' under check but what hit them in the post-Lunch session was Brook's bravado coupled with Joe Root's brains. The 195-run stand between the two Yorkshiremen stunned the visitors and Brook, in particular, took the game away.After Siraj misjudged his catch when Brook was batting on just 19, the right-hander exploded and never looked back. He continued to be severe, struck the ball sweetly and punished India's tired three-seamer attack.The toll of playing all five Tests - the only bowler to do so across both camps - was showing on Siraj as he alongside Akash and Prasidh Krishna desperately sought a wicket. England, meanwhile, didn't give an inch and kept getting closer to the mammoth target without doing anything silly. Yes, the approach did come as a surprise for a side which is known for doing silly things, even when everything is in their control, but Day 4 was a bit different.It wasn't just Bazball. But a much refined approach. Bazball with brains. Root hit a hundred, Brook scored a hundred, India bowlers kept trying but didn't get the results in their favour. But that one hour... that dramatic one hour has set-up another Day 5 finish for what has been a fiercely competitive series.It nearly turned out to be a story of what-could-have-been for the visitors but the drama has ensured they get one final crack on Day 5 morning to get a result in their favour and level the series.","India bowled their heart out in what was a very challenging period to survive for England. Joe Root's wicket, Jacob Bethell's rash shot gave them plenty to believe in fading night. The capacity crowd at The Oval became animated, got behind the visitors who were just about hanging on.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123079665,imgsize-125250,width-400,resizemode-4/123079665.jpg"

Poll Do you think India would have performed better if Virat Kohli was in the squad? Yes, definitely No, the current team is strong Not sure

Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor sparked discussion about India's Test cricket performance against England by highlighting the absence of former captain Virat Kohli , as India faced a crucial loss in the ongoing series. Taking to social media, Tharoor emphasized how Kohli 's leadership, intensity, and batting prowess could have influenced the match outcome.""Is it too late to call him out of retirement? Virat, the nation needs you!"" Tharoor's viral social media post expressed, noting that he had missed Kohli throughout the series, particularly during this Test match.The discussion has brought attention to India's batting depth and on-field energy in critical situations, despite team management supporting the current squad.India, trailing 1-2 in the series, aimed for victory in the fifth and final Test to achieve a 2-2 draw. After scoring 224 in their first innings, they limited England to 247, maintaining a slim 23-run deficit.Yashasvi Jaiswal's century helped India post 396 in their second innings, setting England a target of 374 runs.England's response was strong, with Harry Brook (111) and Joe Root (105) forming a crucial 195-run partnership for the fourth wicket after initially struggling at 106 for three wickets.Play was halted due to rain in the final session with England at 339/6, requiring just 35 runs for victory and the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy with a potential 3-1 series win.Captain Shubman Gill has performed well with over 700 runs in his first series as captain. Other batsmen including K.L. Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Rishabh Pant have also contributed significantly.However, the team has notably missed Kohli's experience and aggressive approach, both in batting and field presence, during his short break from international cricket for personal reasons.The ongoing debate about Kohli's absence continues to influence discussions surrounding Indian cricket, highlighting the impact of one of India's most celebrated cricketers.","Congress leader Shashi Tharoor highlights impact of former captain Virat Kohli's absence.

IND vs ENG: Josh Tongue on England's 374-run chase, Akash Deep's batting and The Oval pitch

A dramatic day of Test cricket at The Oval saw England inch closer to a famous series win, thanks to a breathtaking hundred from Harry Brook and a composed unbeaten knock from Joe Root . But just before tea, India missed a golden opportunity that could have shifted the momentum — a dropped return catch off Jacob Bethell that left the Indian fielders stunned.The moment came in the 65th over when Bethell miscued a leading edge back to the bowler. Akash Deep turned sharply to complete what looked like a simple catch, but slipped badly as his spikes got stuck in the turf. The ball landed agonisingly close to the stumps at the non-striker’s end, with Siraj watching on in disbelief. Bethell had survived — and England marched on.Earlier, England were 106 for 3 and still needed 268 runs when Brook walked in. The right-hander counter-attacked brilliantly, smashing 111 off 98 balls to notch up his 10th Test century in just 50 innings — placing him ninth on the all-time list for fastest to the milestone.Joe Root, batting with calm authority, ended the session on 98 not out. The pair added 195 runs for the fourth wicket, grinding India down on a pitch that had begun to ease. At tea on Day 4, England were 317 for 4, needing just 57 more runs for victory and a 3–1 series win. England look firmly on course for a famous win. From here, India will need nothing short of a miracle to turn things around on a flat pitch and with a soft ball.","England need just 57 more runs for victory and a 3-1 series win.

Poll Was Siraj's misjudgment the turning point in the match? Yes, it cost India crucial runs No, other factors influenced the outcome

In a pivotal moment on Day 4 of the fifth and final Test, India pacer Prasidh Krishna was left red-faced after a misjudgment by his teammate, Mohammed Siraj , cost India crucial runs. During the 35th over of England's chase, Harry Brook top-edged a pull shot off Prasidh and the ball sailed high into the air. Siraj, stationed at long leg, took the catch cleanly, prompting an immediate celebration from Prasidh.However, Prasidh had overlooked one crucial detail: while completing the catch, Siraj had stepped back and touched the boundary cushions with his foot. That meant the ball had gone for six, not a wicket.The celebratory moment quickly turned to disappointment as Prasidh realized what had transpired. Brook, aware of the situation, calmly returned to the crease as Prasidh and Siraj exchanged frustrated glances.The error not only denied India a key breakthrough but also handed Brook six extra runs. He was on 19 at the time and continued to bat aggressively, eventually reaching a match-shaping 111 off just 98 balls. His knock, laced with 14 fours and two sixes, tilted the balance heavily in England’s favour.Ironically, Brook was eventually dismissed by Akash Deep, caught by none other than Siraj himself. The wicket came when Brook tried to step out and slap a slightly short ball through the off-side, only to slice it in the air. His bat flew into the leg side, while the ball landed safely in Siraj’s hands at mid-off. Brook departed to a standing ovation, having left India reeling under scoreboard pressure.Ultimately, the dropped catch meant that Siraj costed his side 92 crucial runs that followed, and Brook’s eventual dismissal all formed part of a defining phase in the Test one that could ultimately decide the series outcome.","Mohammed Siraj dropped Harry Brook when he was on 19 runs.

No cutting corners

Understanding the player

The quiet coach

Long before Khalid Jamil became Indian football’s headline appointment—long before his name was etched in I-League history as the architect of Aizawl FC’s fairytale title run, and long before he coached in the ISL— he was just a young midfielder at Air India , lingering behind after training.He’d buy tea and samosas for his coach, Bimal Ghosh, pull out a chair, and request that he stay back a little longer. Just one more hour, he’d ask. Just one more drill. And then he’d train like a madman. “He used to come early and would be the last to leave,” Ghosh recalls. “I’d be sipping chai and watching him run, trying shooting drills. I’ve never seen anyone train like that.” That madness—disciplined, unrelenting, and almost monk-like in its obsession— has now taken Khalid Jamil to Indian football’s highest seat: Head coach of the national team. And few appointments have felt as honest, and as earned, as this one.A commanding central midfielder, he plied his trade with Air India and Mahindra United, known for his nononsense style, leadership, and consistency. Former teammate Godfrey Pereira, who shared the Air India dressing room with him and later did AFC ALicense coaching alongside him, remembers him as the most disciplined man on the field.“He used to travel all the way from Mira Road to Kalina— never late, never missing training,” Godfrey says. “And as a coach, he’s carried that same spirit. ” What sets Khalid apart is that he never took shortcuts. He built Mumbai FC from the ground up, and shocked the country in 2017 by leading Aizawl FC—a club with one of the league’ssmallest budgets—to an ILeague title.Perhaps Jamil’s biggest strength is his ability to understand players—not just their strengths and weaknesses, but their psychology.Steven Dias, who played with him at Air India and Mahindra and now serves as his assistant coach at Jamshedpur FC, describes him as a coach who never overburdens players. “He understands every player’s capacity,” Dias says. “For instance, when I played under him at Mumbai FC, he gave me complete freedom in attack. He didn’t ask me to defend. That’s his genius.”Jamil doesn’t come from a PR-polished world. He isn’t active on social media. He speaks little—and when he does, it’s straight to the point.“He doesn’t say thank you or sorry,” Godfrey chuckles. “He expects results.” And perhaps that’s why he stands out. His appointment to the top post is also a huge boost for homegrown coaches.","Khalid Jamil is the new head coach of the Indian national team.

AHMEDABAD: When 18-yearold Khushbu Saroj walks on to the pitch at Thuwunna Stadium in Yangon on Aug 6 to face Indonesia in the AFC U-20 Women’s Asian Cup Qualifiers, she’ll carry more than just a jersey with the Indian tricolour — she’ll carry a dream that once seemed impossible.The daughter of a humble gardener, Khushbu has been named in India’s 23-member squad for the continental tournament. Hailing from Ahmedabad, she is joined by Tapi district’s Shubhangi Singh as the two Gujarat players in the squad. For Khushbu, this is not just a football match — it’s a moment of quiet triumph against years of doubt, social resistance, and hardship.“My father works as a gardener in people’s homes. He used to be ridiculed by his friends for letting me leave the house in shorts to play football,” Khushbu recalls. “He would often tell me, ‘ Kuch bhi nahi rakha in sab cheezo mein ’ (There’s no future in such things). But my mother and sisters never gave up on me. They were my strength.”Her journey began in the narrow lanes of Ahmedabad, where she first kicked a ball after watching seniors play at her school. What started as curiosity quickly turned into a passion. But the path wasn’t easy. Her father’s reluctance and societal judgment weighed heavily on the family.Still, Khushbu persisted.It wasn’t until she earned a spot in the Gujarat state team that her father’s attitude began to shift. “When I finally wore the India jersey and returned from Thailand after my first international tournament, my parents came to receive me. They were filled with pride,” she says, a smile audible in her voice.Her coach at Kahaani FC, Lalita Saini, played a pivotal role in her rise. “Lalita ma’am was like a second mother. She guided me in everything – diet, discipline, mental strength. When I got injured in 2022 and my parents asked if I should quit the sport, Lalita ma’am told me injuries are just part of a player’s life. The real story is in making a comeback.”Khushbu’s father’s words today are a stark contrast to the doubts of past: “I used to stop her when she went for training. Today, I’m proud of her.”Her mother’s eyes well up as she added, “People used to mock her. Today feels like a dream. We never imagined our daughter would play for India.”From Ahmedabad to Yangon, Khushbu Saroj’s story is one of perseverance, passion, and quiet revolution – a testament to the power of belief in oneself.",Khushbu Saroj named in India's 23-member squad for AFC U-20 Women's Asian Cup Qualifiers.

Two other Indians, Armando Colaco and Savio Medeira, held interim charges, following the sacking of Bob Houghton in 2011.“It was felt the federation must give an opportunity to an Indian coach,” the AIFF said after its executive committee meeting on Friday. “The members felt that since India are set to participate in the CAFA Nations Cup this month, followed by back-toback AFC Asian Cup final round qualifiers (against Singapore in October), Jamil would be a better option, since he has been working with Indian players on a regular basis. ”AIFF technical director Syed Sabir Pasha and national teams director Subrata Paul presented a SWOT analysis of all the three shortlisted coaches – Jamil, Stephen Constantine, and Stefan Tarkovic. While the mood was in favour of an Indian coach, a “strong recommendation” from technical committee chairperson and former India captain IM Vijayan helped members decide.In its presentation, AIFF said Jamil’s playing style is easy for the players to adapt, and that he is “known to create teams that are hard to score against.” An AFC pro coaching license holder since 2015, the 48-yearold has managed over 200 games in the I-League with stints at clubs like Mumbai FC, Aizawl FC – with whom he scripted a fairytale I-League triumph – East Bengal and Mohun Bagan. In the Indian Super League (ISL), now the top-tier league, he has guided NorthEast United FC and Jamshedpur to the semifinals, despite being teams with much lower budgets.Jamil’s teams are known to be disciplined and well drilled. It’s no secret either that he likes to work with a core group of players who he has trusted through his career, none of them big names or superstars.“At Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, two of the biggest clubs Khalid has managed, he was never really successful,” said Pradhyum Reddy, Dempo’s technical director who has formerly coached in both I-League and ISL. “The question is whether he can manage the egos (in the national team dressing room) or get rid of the egos.”Others feel Jamil’s lack of experience with international football can prove to be challenging.“Khalid was the best option among the three coaches who were shortlisted. But purely from a technical point of view, it’s not the best appointment,” said Reddy.Many feel the AIFF were left with no choice than make a domestic coach appointment due to the precarious state of its finances. The budgets, according to sources, have been approved only till December, when the 15-year agreement with its marketing partners comes to an end.“Without an assured annual payment of Rs 50 crore (from the marketing partners), AIFF will be left with nothing. At times like these, hiring an experienced Indian coach makes perfect sense,” said one member.AIFF sources said the plan is to offer Jamil a two-year contract with a one-year extension clause. Neither party is in favour of a dual club-andcountry role.● Youngest Indian coach to win the I-League.● Most number of matches in I-League by any coach.● First full-time Indian coach in ISL, with NorthEast United and now Jamshedpur.● Guided Aizawl FC to a historic I-League title in 2017, finishing a point ahead of Mohun Bagan.● Reached ISL semifinals with NorthEast and Jamshedpur. Super Cup finalist with East Bengal (2018) and Jamshedpur (2025).● Made his national team debut in 1997 in a SAFF Cup match against Bangladesh in Kathmandu.● Played 15 matches for India till his retirement in 2006 due to injuries.Tajikistan vs IndiaIndia vs IranAfghanistan vs IndiaSingapore vs IndiaIndia vs SingaporeBangladesh vs India","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has cleared the path for Khalid Jamil to take over as coach of the national football team.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor. Massive congratulations. You are the future of this sport.”Recalling Barnard’s maiden pole, a fan also wrote, “Fantastic season, Taylor, we'll never forget that Monaco pole.”Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Barnard claimed five podiums in his first full season in Formula E.

Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

He was joined on the podium on Sunday by Envision Racing’s Sébastien Buemi.Nyck de Vries’ double podium in London brought his season tally to three, having also finished second in Monaco. Reflecting on his second consecutive podium, de Vries said, “It was certainly a very challenging race. Obviously, Nick [Cassidy] didn’t want to get too low on energy compared to everyone behind, so he was making sure he stayed on the same energy level as us. That resulted in a bit of a concertina effect behind us. ”He added, “I’m very pleased to bring home another podium and secure P4 for our team, because they’ve done an incredible job. To think that last year we qualified last on merit, and now we’ve come such a long way to finish fourth in the championship — this is a great effort.I’m very proud of everyone at Mahindra.”Envision Racing’s Sebastien Buemi also earned his third podium of the season in London, finishing third behind Nick Cassidy and Nyck de Vries in Sunday’s Round 16.

I think I was lucky enough to avoid them well. I saved quite a bit of energy at the beginning, and that basically allowed me to take Attack Mode properly. So, in the end, I’m very happy with that.

SRH vs DC IPL 2025, Hyderabad weather prediction

Delhi Capitals will aim to revive their playoff hopes and arrest a two-match losing streak at home when they face a struggling Sunrisers Hyderabad in a must-win IPL 2025 clash on Monday. Axar Patel’s side, currently fifth with 12 points from 10 games, have relied heavily on away wins but will need to find form in familiar conditions to stay in the top-four race.Axar, who bruised his left hand in the previous game against KKR but still smashed a valiant 43, remains a fitness concern. His full bowling involvement could be key, especially against an SRH side all but out of playoff contention after a 38-run loss to Gujarat Titans.While KL Rahul and Abhishek Porel have led DC's batting, their inability to accelerate at crucial moments has been costly. However, Mitchell Starc and Mukesh Kumar form a potent attack, with Axar's presence adding balance.SRH, despite big names like Pat Cummins, Mohammed Shami, Travis Head, and Heinrich Klaasen, have failed to click. Pacer Jaydev Unadkat pointed to inconsistent bowling and pitch conditions as major hurdles.With both teams desperate for points, the match promises high stakes and intensity at Arun Jaitley Stadium.A scorching day in Hyderabad, and the pitch is an absolute belter. Dry, hard, and full of runs, it promises a high-scoring contest with a par score expected around 220–230. The dimensions offer some imbalance — 63 meters to the right, 70 to the left, and 77 down the ground — giving batters plenty to target. While the surface heavily favours batters, both sides possess quality seamers who could make early inroads. The only grass lies behind the stumps, offering no real help to bowlers. Dew hasn't played a major role at this venue, so the toss is unlikely to be decisive.Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Aniket Verma, Kamindu Mendis, Pat Cummins (c), Harshal Patel, Jaydev Unadkat, Zeeshan Ansari, Mohammed ShamiImpact Player – Travis HeadFaf du Plessis, Abishek Porel (wk), Karun Nair, KL Rahul, Axar Patel (c), Tristan Stubbs, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Dushmantha Chameera, Mukesh KumarImpact Player - Sameer RizviPat Cummins (c), Ishan Kishan (wk), Atharva Taide, Abhinav Manohar, Aniket Verma, Sachin Baby, Smaran Ravichandran, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Travis Head, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Shami, Rahul Chahar, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan Ansari, Jaydev Unadkat, Eshan Malinga.Axar Patel (c), Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, Karun Nair, KL Rahul (wk), Tristan Stubbs, Ashutosh Sharma, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Mukesh Kumar, Sameer Rizvi, Darshan Nalkande, Donovan Ferreira, Tripurana Vijay, Dushmantha Chameera, Faf du Plessis, T Natarajan, Ajay Jadav Mandal, Manvanth Kumar L, Madhav Tiwari.Played: 25SRH wins: 13DC wins: 12Hyderabad will see mostly sunny conditions through the day following late-night showers.

Poll What do you think was the biggest factor in LSG's defeat against PBKS? Strong PBKS Batting Poor Batting Performance Misjudged Conditions Dropped Catches

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) find themselves in a precarious position in the Indian Premier League IPL ) 2025 after succumbing to a 37-run defeat against Punjab Kings (PBKS) at the HPCA Stadium on Sunday.The loss marks LSG’s sixth of the season, leaving them seventh on the points table with 10 points from 11 games. With just three league matches remaining, they now face a must-win scenario to stay alive in the playoff race.Following the high-scoring clash, LSG skipper Rishabh Pant did not mince words as he pointed to dropped catches as the turning point of the game. “Definitely too many runs. When you're gonna drop crucial catches at the wrong time, it is going to hurt you badly,” Pant said in the post-match presentation.Pant further reflected on the match, highlighting that LSG had misjudged the conditions early on and failed to adapt swiftly. “We thought it was going to do more. We didn't pick the length right at the start. That's part and parcel of the game,” he said. “The dream is still alive. If we're gonna win the next three matches, we definitely can turn it around.”Sent in to bat, PBKS posted a daunting 236/5, powered by a blistering 91 off 48 balls from Prabhsimran Singh . He stitched crucial partnerships with skipper Shreyas Iyer (45) and Shashank Singh (33*) to pile pressure on LSG. Despite late fightbacks from Ayush Badoni (74) and Abdul Samad (45), LSG managed only 199/7 in reply.Pant acknowledged lack of support to the top order. “In every match, you can't hope they will come off nicely… We need to take the game deep. Every time, they can't do the heavy job for us,” he said.With PBKS rising to second place with 15 points, LSG will need to fix their fielding lapses and deliver flawless performances in their final three games to remain in the hunt.","Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) lost to Punjab Kings (PBKS) by 37 runs on Sunday. LSG are now seventh on the points table with 10 points from 11 games. PBKS are second on the table with 15 points, while LSG have 10 points.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120886179,imgsize-97634,width-400,resizemode-4/Rishabh-Pant.jpg"

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

Real Madrid secured a crucial 3-2 victory against Celta Vigo at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday, with Kylian Mbappe scoring twice to keep their La Liga title hopes alive. The win maintains their four-point gap behind leaders Barcelona ahead of next weekend's crucial El Clasico showdown.Real Madrid built a commanding three-goal lead before surviving a late comeback attempt from seventh-placed Celta Vigo, who are pursuing European qualification for next season.The hosts entered the match dealing with multiple defensive injuries but managed to overcome an early period of Celta pressure to take control of the proceedings.""The game seemed finished... you have to remember we're without six defenders and we're not always capable of solving these things,"" said Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti. ""Yes it could have been dealt with better, we suffered a bit, but it's a nice victory.""""We had a very good first half (but)... we fell apart, these things can't happen, it's happened to us a lot,"" Real Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde said on the club's television channel. ""We left a lot minutes for them to get comfortable and they are a great team and they put us in a tough spot.""Twenty-year-old Arda Guler , starting in place of the ill Rodrygo, demonstrated his potential early with an ambitious overhead kick that went wide.Celta created early chances as former Barcelona defender Marcos Alonso headed over and forced a save from Thibaut Courtois, while Aurelien Tchouameni missed a good heading opportunity for Madrid.Guler broke the deadlock after 33 minutes with a brilliant curling shot past Vicente Guaita after creating space in the box.Mbappe doubled Madrid's advantage in the 39th minute, finishing off a quick counterattack initiated by Courtois' save from Borja Iglesias, with Bellingham providing the assist.The French striker added his second goal just three minutes into the second half, converting a perfectly weighted pass from Guler for his 24th league goal of the season, putting him one behind Barcelona's Robert Lewandowski.Celta fought back as Javier Rodriguez scored from close range following a controversial corner decision.The introduction of Iago Aspas energised Celta's attack, and he provided an excellent assist for Williot Swedberg to score their second goal.Courtois had a nervous moment when Pablo Duran's shot nearly slipped from his grasp and crossed the line.""It's the game of the year for us, the last chance for us to win La Liga,"" said Valverde about the upcoming Clasico.In other La Liga action, Real Betis maintained pressure on Villarreal in the race for the fifth Champions League spot with a late 2-1 win at Espanyol, while Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad played out a goalless draw in their Basque derby.",Real Madrid beat Celta Vigo 3-2 at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Just days after lighting up the cricket world with a jaw-dropping 35-ball century, 14-year-old Rajasthan Royals prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi has once again stunned fans — but this time, not with the bat.The young sensation from Samastipur, Bihar, who smashed 11 sixes in a whirlwind knock at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, became an overnight star. His innings, against an attack featuring the likes of Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar, Rashid Khan, and Karim Janat, was the second-fastest century in tournament history.Now, ahead of Royals' IPL 2025 clash against Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday, Suryavanshi turned heads again — but this time during a net session with the ball in hand.In a stunning moment, the teen bowled to a batter in the nets and produced massive turn, shattering the stumps clean in half. Teammates and staff were left in disbelief at the sheer skill and impact of the delivery.From a batting sensation to a potential all-rounder in the making, Suryavanshi’s talent continues to amaze — and he's only 14.RR bowling coach Shane Bond had revealed that the team management is ‘protecting’ the young star.“The coaching staff haven’t tried to complicate things too much with Vaibhav. He’s sort of got a bit of a license to go out and just play, which he’s done an amazing job so far, really, for a 14-year-old. So look again, he missed out in the last game, but for us, you don’t really want to panic with someone so young, you just come out and plug in tomorrow,"" Bond said at the pre-match press conference.“I know Vikram (Rathour) talks about his game plans and the type of bowlers that he’s going to come up against and he’ll do that again for this match, but outside of that, he’s a pretty young kid, so I’m just happy for him to get out there and keep swinging. It’ll be that again,"" he added.“He’s (Vaibhav) obviously a seriously talented player, but he’s also still a kid. So, he’s sort of learning on the go, we’re going to be really patient with him because you have to be. And the other part of it is just all the off-field stuff, the travel (and such), you can’t expect a 14-year-old to be a professional. Like I’ve got a 16-year-old son and he’s a teenager, so we’re just trying to educate him on the things around and look after him, shield him a little bit from the social media stuff and all the trappings that come with the way he started, but he’s a lovely kid,"" Bond said.","14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi has once again stunned fans with the bat.

prediction

Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) will be desperate to turn their fortunes around at Eden Gardens when they face Rajasthan Royals (RR) in a crucial IPL clash on Sunday. With four league matches left, the equation for the defending champions is clear: win all four and qualify for the playoffs.Skipper Ajinkya Rahane, recovering from a hand injury, confirmed his intent to play: “I’m fine. I’m trying my best and hopefully I’ll play the match on Sunday.”KKR have struggled at home this season, with just one win from five outings. Their spinners have failed to exploit home conditions, and the batting unit has underperformed. Vice-captain Venkatesh Iyer, re-signed for Rs 23.75 crore, has been underwhelming with only 142 runs in 10 games.Rinku Singh and Quinton de Kock have also failed to fire consistently, making KKR's task steeper. However, their recent 14-run win over Delhi Capitals, led by Sunil Narine’s all-round brilliance, has reignited belief.Eliminated RR, meanwhile, have little to lose and could play party spoilers. With captain Sanju Samson absent and Jos Buttler gone, RR’s young guns will need to step up to salvage pride in what’s been a disappointing campaign.There’s a lush covering of grass, especially around the good and short of a length areas, promising consistent bounce and pace at Eden Gardens. Early swing is expected in the powerplay, so pacers must pitch it up and make the most of the movement. Unlike typical Eden conditions, the even grass cover means spinners may find it tough, with little turn likely. This pitch looks set for a high-scoring contest, but the new ball will be crucial. Early wickets could tilt the game, so exploiting swing early on will be key for the bowlers before it becomes a batter’s paradise.Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Andre Russell, Rovman Powell, Harshit Rana, Anukul Roy, Varun ChakaravarthyImpact Player – Vaibhav Arora/Ramandeep SinghYashasvi Jaiswal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Nitish Rana, Riyan Parag (c), Dhruv Jurel (wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Wanindu Hasaranga, Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana, Sandeep Sharma, Yudhvir Singh CharakImpact Player - Akash Madhwal/Shubham DubeyAjinkya Rahane (c), Rinku Singh, Quinton de Kock (wk), Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Rovman Powell, Manish Pandey, Luvnith Sisodia, Venkatesh Iyer, Anukul Roy, Moeen Ali, Ramandeep Singh, Andre Russell, Anrich Nortje, Vaibhav Arora, Mayank Markande, Spencer Johnson, Harshit Rana, Sunil Narine, Varun Chakaravarthy and Chetan Sakariya.Sanju Samson (c), Riyan Parag, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shimron Hetmyer, Shubham Dubey, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Dhruv Jurel (wk), Kunal Singh Rathore, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Nitish Rana, Sandeep Sharma, Tushar Deshpande, Akash Madhwal, Kumar Kartikeya, Kwena Maphaka, Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Ashok Sharma and Jofra Archer.Played: 31KKR wins: 15RR wins: 14No Result: 2Expect a damp start to the day in Kolkata with a couple of soaking morning showers, particularly around 11 AM when cloudy skies and rain are likely.

Poll Do you think Andre Russell can maintain this form for the rest of the tournament? No, it was just a one-off performance. Yes, he's back in form!

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

KOLKATA: Riyan Parag was brilliant, but in the end, Andre Russell 's power prevailed. But not before a last-ball thriller sent the hearts pounding. With 22 required off the last over, Rajasthan Royals almost got there, losing to Kolkata Knight Riders by a mere one run at the Eden Gardens on Sunday.Needing three off the last ball, Royals batters Subham Dubey and Jofra Archer scampered for two runs, failing to complete the second. Quick-thinking Rinku Singh ensured Archer was short of his crease and the celebrations resembled KKR's trophy-winning triumph last season.This win will surely give confidence to KKR going forward. And they have many positives to draw inspiration from. The first being big burly Jamaican Russell, who finally arrived with his muscles as KKR remained alive in their quest for a qualifiers spot.Veteran Russell, who had a rather disappointing tournament so far with the bat, scoring just 72 runs in 10 innings, added another 57 off just 25 balls, remaining unbeaten and in the process taking the KKR score to 206 for four, a chase that proved tantalizingly out of Royals reach, who finished at 205 for eight. Even Royals skipper Parag's blazing 95 proved inadequate.When it looked as if the Royals would cave in meekly, Parag threatened to change the script with six consecutive sixes (not taking a wide into account), five off Moeen Ali and one off Varun Chakravarthy. All clean hits that gave them hope of a dramatic turnaround.However, Parag was fighting a lone battle. Yashasvi Jaiswal's 34 and Shimron Hetmyer's 29 were never going to be enough. Dubey tried to finish it off with his unbeaten 25, but it was not to be.On a wicket that was helping spinners, Russell's innings stood out for its sheer power.More than the Jamaican's runs, it was the timing of his innings that made it look so special. With the Knights striving to step on the accelerator at 121 for three after 15 overs, they desperately needed Russell to join in with his strong arms.Russell did just that, smashing the Royals bowlers all over the park as the defending champions amassed 85 runs in the last five overs.There were also Angkrish Raghuvanshi's 44 and Rinku Singh's six-ball 19 adding to the flourishing finish.The ruthless aggression started in the 16th over, with Akash Madhwal conceding 15. Jofra Archer's brilliant first two-over spell went for a toss as he eventually gave away 30 in his four. Spinner Maheesh Theeksana's 18 in three overs became 41 in four. The game had turned on its head.The Russell mayhem followed a much slower 15 overs with Rahmanullah Gurbaz (35) and Ajinkya Rahane (30) going steady. An over the bowler's head six was the KKR skipper's standout shot.",Kolkata Knight Riders beat Rajasthan Royals by one run in IPL. Andre Russell scored 57 off just 25 balls to help KKR reach 206 for four. Royals skipper Riyan Parag hit six consecutive sixes for six runs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120887139,imgsize-147400,width-400,resizemode-4/Riyan-Parag.jpg"

Sachin Tendulkar at 52: Power, Pride, and a Nation’s Pulse

Rishabh Pant lost both his grip on the bat and on the match, as Punjab Kings delivered a commanding 37-run win over Lucknow Super Giants at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala on Sunday. The victory was built on a stunning 48-ball 91 from Prabhsimran Singh and a fiery spell from Arshdeep Singh , who dismantled LSG’s top order with figures of 3/16 in four overs.Prabhsimran’s blitz helped PBKS post a daunting 236/5. In response, LSG were restricted to 199/7, with only Ayush Badoni (74 off 40) offering resistance. Even if Lucknow win all their remaining games to reach 16 points, their poor net run rate could keep them out of the playoffs race.Arshdeep's early burst removed three key batters—Mitchell Marsh (0), Aiden Markram (13), and Nicholas Pooran (6)—within the Powerplay, virtually sealing the game for Punjab inside the first six overs.Punjab have now jumped to second on the points table with 15 points from 11 matches, needing just one more win to likely confirm a playoff berth.However, questions continue to swirl around LSG captain Rishabh Pant’s form. The ?27 crore acquisition has scored just 128 runs in 11 innings at a strike rate under 100 (99.22).On Sunday, he managed only 18 off 17 before a wild slog against Azmatullah Omarzai ended in a comical dismissal, with his bat flying one way and the ball the other.Pant's struggles reflect LSG’s season-long woes—particularly their weak bowling unit, shaped by poor auction decisions. Pace spearhead Mayank Yadav, returning from rehab, looked a shadow of his former self and was hammered for 60 runs in four overs, conceding six sixes.Prabhsimran, meanwhile, was unstoppable. After a solid opening from Jos Inglis, who smashed Mayank for three sixes in an over, Prabhsimran took charge. Partnering with Shreyas Iyer (45 off 25), he built a 78-run stand before falling just nine runs short of a well-deserved hundred, attempting a switch hit.Shashank Singh’s late cameo (33 off 15) further lifted PBKS to a massive total that proved too much for LSG to chase.",Punjab Kings beat Lucknow Super Giants by 37 runs. Prabhsimran Singh scored 91 from 48 balls. Arshdeep Singh took 3/16 in four overs.

Poll Do you think KKR can secure a playoff spot after this win? It's too close to call No, they will struggle Yes, definitely!

NEW DELHI: It was far too close for comfort at Eden Gardens on Sunday as Kolkata Knight Riders survived a last-ball scare to edge out Rajasthan Royals by just one run in a high-octane IPL 2025 thriller, keeping their playoff hopes alive.Defending 206, KKR held their nerve in the final over, where Royals needed 22 runs to win. Impact substitute Shubham Dubey (25 not out off 14 balls) almost pulled off the impossible, smashing two sixes and a four to bring the equation down to three runs off the final ball.But Rinku Singh , continuing a stellar night in the field, executed a good throw from long-off after quick pick-up to run out Jofra Archer (12) and deny RR a Super Over.The result lifted KKR to sixth on the points table with 11 points. They still need to win all three remaining matches to stay in the playoff hunt, but this win, carved out through nerves of steel and sheer fielding excellence, was a big step forward.The victory was shaped by two game-changing contributions — Andre Russell 's ferocious 25-ball 57* and Rinku Singh's electric fielding.KKR were at 149/3 after 17 overs, before Russell tore into Maheesh Theekshana with three consecutive sixes and followed it up with 12 more runs off Archer. Rinku then hammered 22 off the final over bowled by Akash Madhwal, including two sixes and a four, helping KKR post a daunting 206/4.But it wasn't just about the runs. Rinku turned the tide in the field, saving crucial boundaries and effecting the game-turning run-out. “I enjoy my fielding, probably more than my batting,” said Rinku after the match. “It was important to save that boundary [18.2 overs]. This is one of the quickest outfields in India. I like to take responsibility [in the field].”Riyan Parag played a captain's knock for Rajasthan Royals, smashing 95 off 45 balls to lead the chase, while Yashasvi Jaiswal (34) and Shimron Hetmyer (29) added momentum. But KKR's bowlers — Varun Chakravarthy (2/32), Moeen Ali (2/43), Harshit Rana (2/41), and Vaibhav Arora (1/50) — chipped in at key moments.For KKR, Angkrish Raghuvanshi (44), Rahmanullah Gurbaz (35), and Ajinkya Rahane (30) also made solid contributions. For RR, Parag's all-round effort included 1/21, while Archer, Yudhvir, and Theekshana took a wicket apiece.","Kolkata Knight Riders beat Rajasthan Royals by one run in IPL 2025.

Bayern Munich were crowned German champions for the 34th time on Sunday, giving striker Harry Kane his first major trophy, after second-placed Bayer Leverkusen drew 2-2 at Freiburg.Bayern's 3-3 draw at RB Leipzig on Saturday, when the Bavarians came from two goals down to take the lead before conceding a stoppage-time equaliser, meant defending Bundesliga champions Leverkusen needed to win at Freiburg to delay the title party.Leverkusen were two goals down before scoring twice in the last 10 minutes.But Xabi Alonso's side could not find a third, as Bayern reclaimed the title at the first attempt after Leverkusen ended their 11-year reign last season.Alonso, who won three Bundesliga titles as a player with Bayern, congratulated his former club.""Congratulations to Bayern. It's a deserved championship. They were more consistent team over the season and they deserve the shield,"" Alonso said to DAZN.Kane, who had never previously won silverware, was among a group of Bayern players who gathered to watch the Leverkusen game in Munich on Sunday.The England captain was suspended for the match at Leipzig but will return this Saturday against Borussia Moenchengladbach at home, where Bayern will be presented with the Bundesliga shield at full-time.Given Bayern's far superior goal difference, Leverkusen's chances of defending their title were already all but impossible.Freiburg's Maximilian Eggestein hit a stunning goal from outside the box before half-time and Piero Hincapie was pressured into scoring an own goal just after the break.Florian Wirtz netted a spectacular solo goal with eight minutes remaining, carving through the middle of the field before firing the ball in off the post.Jonathan Tah headed Leverkusen level in stoppage time, but the visitors were unable to find the third goal which would have extended their spell as champions.The result left Leverkusen, who became the first team in history to win the title unbeaten last season, eight points behind Bayern with two games remaining.With the faint title hopes gone, Leverkusen's focus will turn to keeping hold of Alonso and Wirtz, who could both be headed for the exit in summer.Alonso has a contract at Leverkusen until 2026 but has been heavily linked with Real Madrid, where he spent five seasons as a player.Wirtz's deal expires in 2027 but the Germany midfielder is reportedly considering a big-money move to Bayern.Tah, who has already confirmed he will leave the club on a free transfer after a decade in Leverkusen, said his side had ""too little intensity, we had too few runs in behind. It didn't work today.""The Germany centre-back has been linked with moves to Barcelona and Bayern, but said ""we'll see"" where he plays next season.The late goal meant Leverkusen extended their unbeaten streak away from home to 33 games, equalling a Bundesliga record set by Bayern.The draw keeps Freiburg in fourth, one point clear of Borussia Dortmund, in the final Champions League spot. Freiburg have never played in Europe's top competition.Earlier on Sunday, Holstein Kiel won 3-1 at Augsburg, keeping their hopes of beating the drop alive.Kiel won thanks to a double from Alexander Bernhardsson and a Shuto Machino penalty and are now one point behind Heidenheim in the relegation play-off spot.In Sunday's late game, Eintracht Frankfurt can take a major step towards a top-four spot and Champions League qualification with a win at local rivals Mainz.",Bayern Munich crowned German champions for the 34th time on Sunday.

The British colonizers wanted Kolkata to be the London of the east, but in spirit, the Bengalis have always preferred Paris.From the musicality of the two languages to the celebration of avant-garde art, the cities do share a bond. When Satyajit Ray won the Légion d'honneur — the highest French national order of merit — in 1987, the standard feeling in Kolkata was: “We’ll always have Paris.”The cultural connect is on the wane. But now, there’s a football parallel between the cities as Paris FC won their promotion into the top tier of French football — Ligue 1 .Parc des Princes, home to Paris St-Germain, is merely 193m away from the new Paris FC ground, and the fans have already started calling it “the closest derby in the world .”But then, Kolkata isn’t too far away. The East Bengal and Mohun Bagan grounds, located in the Maidan area, are just 800m apart. But if you take a shortcut, it is merely a five-minute walk.The two giants don’t play the derby — when it involves senior men’s football — at their own grounds anymore. They prefer the Salt Lake Stadium — a la San Siro in Milan — because of security issues. The fact that Salt Lake Stadium can accommodate up to one lakh fans makes it financially viable for the clubs as well.But there was a time when the two teams played at each other’s grounds. There was, of course, the ‘neutral’ Eden Gardens, designated venue of the ‘big match’, but cricket always took precedence there.The famous 1975 IFA Shield final, where East Bengal beat Mohun Bagan 5-0 — the biggest margin recorded between the two teams till date — was played at the Bagan ground.The hero of that afternoon, the late Subhas Bhowmick, would often recall how difficult it was to return to their home tent on that afternoon, with thousands of fans making it an occasion to remember.Till the late 1980s, the two teams did play at each other’s homes on and off, especially in the Calcutta Football League.The hockey derby was played at East Bengal and Mohun Bagan grounds, but that’s also a thing of the past.Memories of the Maidan derby linger, and when PSG and Paris FC take the field for the “closest derby,” the old Maidan regular will take a trip down memory lane — once upon a time, it was ours.","The two giants don’t play the derby — when it involves senior men’s football — at their own grounds anymore.

Barcelona strengthened their grip on the La Liga title by securing a 2-1 comeback victory against already-relegated Real Valladolid on Saturday, extending their lead to seven points over Real Madrid. The win came despite heavy rotation from coach Hansi Flick , who prioritised Tuesday's Champions League semi-final against Inter Milan, with Raphinha and Fermin Lopez scoring second-half goals to overturn Ivan Sanchez's early opener.Barcelona made nine changes to their starting lineup from Wednesday's 3-3 Champions League draw with Inter Milan, with only Pedri and Gerard Martin retained.Marc-Andre ter Stegen returned to the Barcelona goal for his first appearance since September after recovering from injury.""He showed how good he is, how he can perform and it's good to see that,"" said Flick, who confirmed Wojciech Szczesny would return for the Inter match and next weekend's Clasico against Real Madrid.""I was really looking forward to playing this game and it's always better with a win for the team,"" Ter Stegen told DAZN.The hosts took an early lead when Martin's shot deflected off Ronald Araujo and looped past Ter Stegen after just six minutes.Valladolid fans expressed their displeasure with majority owner and president Ronaldo by throwing fake banknotes bearing his face and chanting for his departure.The first half saw chances for both sides, with Valladolid keeper Andre Ferreira denying Pau Victor and Ansu Fati, while Ter Stegen made an important save from Raul Moro.Barcelona debutant Dani Rodriguez was forced off with a shoulder injury, leading to the introduction of 17-year-old Lamine Yamal , who had impressed against Inter midweek.Yamal contributed to Barcelona's equalizer, with his cross being parried by Ferreira before Raphinha collected the loose ball to score his 16th league goal of the season.Lopez then secured the victory by converting Martin's cross from inside the area, with Araujo making a crucial late intervention to preserve the win.""When you make nine changes in the line-up, it's not easy for these guys who came in,"" Flick said. ""In the end I'm satisfied with three more points and we gave some players less minutes, and this is good for me.""In other La Liga action, Atletico Madrid played out a goalless draw at struggling Alaves, maintaining their hold on third place with Champions League qualification virtually secured.Alaves moved to 16th position, three points clear of the relegation zone following the valuable point against Atletico.The match saw few clear opportunities, with Atletico's first shot on target coming from Lino with 20 minutes remaining, while Jan Oblak made an impressive save to deny Kike Garcia.""Neither side could get the upper hand... the game was played in the middle of the pitch without any danger,"" said Atletico coach Diego Simeone.Villarreal strengthened their Champions League qualification hopes with a 4-2 victory over Osasuna, featuring two goals from Ayoze Perez.The win put Villarreal in fifth place, four points ahead of Real Betis, who face Espanyol on Sunday.",Barcelona beat Real Valladolid 2-1 to extend La Liga lead to seven points.

Arsenal faced a setback before their Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain as Bournemouth secured their first-ever away victory against them with a 2-1 win, while Aston Villa strengthened their top five aspirations by defeating Fulham 1-0 on Saturday, May 4, 2025, in London.Arsenal initially took control when Declan Rice scored in the first half during his 100th appearance for the club.The lead was short-lived as Dean Huijsen equalised, followed by Evanilson's winning goal for Bournemouth.The defeat comes at a crucial time for Arsenal, who are already trailing 1-0 to PSG in their Champions League semi-final first leg and face the return leg in Paris on Wednesday.Arsenal, currently in second place, need six more points to secure Champions League qualification through a top-five Premier League finish.The London club has finished as runners-up to Manchester City in the previous two seasons and now sees the Champions League as their only remaining chance for silverware this term.Arsenal's last Champions League final appearance was in 2006, and they have never won the competition.""We should have put the game to bed. We defended really poorly, nowhere near the standards that we are used to. We wanted to generate the momentum and a really positive vibe today and we haven't. What we have created is frustration, rage and anger.

FC Goa crowned Kalinga Super Cup champions after 3-0 win over Jamshedpur FC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/fc-goa-crowned-super-cup-champions/articleshow/120858132.cms,"Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

Bhubaneswar: It was a fairytale end to coach Manolo Marquez’s tenure at FC Goa as his men bid him adieu with the perfect parting gift by clinching the Kalinga Super Cup with a dominant 3-0 win over Jamshedpur FC here on Saturday.And their happy ending with the Spanish coach also scripted a new beginning as they claimed an AFC ACL2 spot – their second continental sojourn, having qualified for the AFC Champions League with their ISL Shield win in 2010-21.While the trophy presentation was conducted indoors after a sudden cyclonic storm and rains affected a proper ceremony in front of its supporters, it could not dampen FC Goa’s celebrations following their brilliant performance at Kalinga Stadium.Wearing black armbands in tribute to the victims of Lairai Devi Temple in Goa, the Gaurs took the wind away from under Jamshedpur players’ feet as Borja Herrera, who was adjudged the player of the match, scored a brace (23’, 51’) followed by another strike from Dejan Drazic (72’) earned them their first trophy since the 2021 Durand Cup.As for Khalid Jamil and his Red Miners, it was heartbreak for them as they conceded three goals and a defeat having not conceded a single of them in this edition before the final.It was a speedy start to the match with both teams pressing high from the word-go and trying to build the momentum for that all-important breakthrough.For Jamshedpur, Rei Tachikawa went for a long shot in the first minute itself and captain Javi Hernandez then darted into the box from the left for a shot that was well saved by young Goa custodian Hrithik Tiwari in the second minute.Goa, however, began growing into the game soon after with Herrera and Aakash Sangwan looking to control the game from the left and right flanks respectively.And Marquez and his men did not have to wait long for the opener as a brilliant through from the middle by Drazic reached Sangwan on the left wing while deceiving Ashutosh Mehta outside the box. The youngster shot the ball low to the left of Albino Gomes, who had no option but to parry it near an onrushing Herrera, who shot the rebound only for Stephen Eze to block. However, there was no stopping the Spaniard on the second rebound as he made no mistake in shooting it higher and into the left of the goal.The breakthrough only made Goa more dominant even as Jamshedpur tried their best to get back into the game.Their best chance of the half came in the 43rd minute from a corner kick that almost hit the outstretched hand of Sandesh Jhingan in front of the goal Instead, Lazar Cirkovic’s header hit the woodwork.All plans and strategies that Jamil might have discussed during the break came to naught soon after the change of end as Gomes, who had kept three clean sheets in the tournament so far, was beaten by a screamer out of nowhere from Herrera, who had made a run from the midfield.It was Herrera’s fourth goal of the Super Cup as he levelled with teammate Iker Guarrotxena as the topscorer while taking the match away from Jamshedpur.However, to the further disappointment of the Red Miners fans, who had long been their No. 12 of the final with their cheers, it was Drazic who sealed the match and the trophy for his team by receiving a long through from Carl McHugh and going around Gomes to confidently put the ball into the net and the Red Miners’ dreams of a trophy into dust.","FC Goa clinch Kalinga Super Cup with 3-0 win over Jamshedpur FC.

Indian coach will hope for a treble against Manolo as JFC take on

in Super Cup final

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

BHUBANESWAR: It’s the last mile of the season and two of the teams remaining out of 15 will battle it out for the Kalinga Super Cup here on Saturday.While Jamshedpur FC will be eager to script their first Super Cup title, FC Goa will play their hearts out to claim their second trophy of the tournament and give their outgoing coach Manolo Marquez a fitting farewell.But along with the title, a victory in the final at Kalinga Stadium will earn the winners a ticket to the AFC Champions League 2 Preliminary Round.The Gaurs have already had a taste of continental football at the 2021 AFC Champions League. But it’s uncharted territory for the Red Miners. “For us, it’s very important because it would be the first time that we qualify for an Asian competition, so we’ll try to give our best,” JFC head coach Khalid Jamil said at the pre-match press conference on Friday.But having lost out on their trophy hopes in the ISL semifinal, Goa will leave no stone unturned in their quest for the continental pass.“When you have this opportunity (to qualify for Asia), obviously you have to be very motivated. FC Goa already played in the Champions League four years ago. Jamshedpur never did. But both teams would want to make it to this competition,” were Marquez’s words at the pre-match interaction.While Goa have a better head-to-head statistic over Jamshedpur overall, Jamil’s men have done a double on them this ISL season and will be keen for a treble against their rivals on Saturday.Both coaches, however, refused to dwell on the past.“Every game is different. We can say that we finished second and Jamshedpur finished 10 points below us, but we lost both games against them. They were much better in Jamshedpur. In Goa, maybe in the first half we were better and they were better in the second. But now, it’s a final, and I think it’s not important what happened in the past,” added Marquez.The Spaniard’s words were echoed by his Indian counterpart at the joint media interaction when he too termed the final “a totally different game”.And to claim the honours on the day, Jamshedpur will bank on their defensive unit — led by Stephen Eze and comprising a mix of youth and experience in Ashutosh Mehta, Pronay Halder and Mohd Uvais — that stood strong against Mumbai City FC in their 1-0 semifinal win.Rei Tachikawa, who scored the winner, will also have to play a pivotal role in midfield along with skipper Javier Hernandez, while the scoring prowess of Jordan Murray and Javier Siverio will be crucial to earn Jamshedpur their first trophy.On the other hand, Goa’s semifinal star Borja Herrera will need to keep up his season’s form along with ISL’s Emerging Player of the Season, Brison Fernandes, and hat-trick scorer in the last 16, Iker Guarrotxena, in their bid to break the Red Miners’ defence.Skipper Odei Onaindia and veteran Sandesh Jhingan, meanwhile, will be crucial in holding the Gaurs’ fort against the striking threats from Jamshedpur.“Fifteen teams tried to win the tournament. We knew that we had to win four games and, thanks to the team, we won three. There are no easy games here. So let’s see what happens,” was Marquez’s assessment of the summit clash.But whoever wins, with both coaches having full squads at their disposal, it’s expected to be a thrilling finale to the Indian domestic season.",Jamshedpur FC take on FC Goa in the Kalinga Super Cup final on Saturday. The winner will earn a ticket to the AFC Champions League 2 Preliminary Round.

Manchester City secured a crucial 1-0 victory against Wolves at the Etihad Stadium on Friday, with Kevin De Bruyne scoring the winning goal to boost their Champions League qualification hopes, moving them to third place in the Premier League standings.City have now won five consecutive matches in all competitions for only the second time this season, providing a significant lift to their European ambitions.The win gives City a four-point cushion over sixth-placed Nottingham Forest, who have a game in hand against Crystal Palace on Monday, while fourth-placed Newcastle and fifth-placed Chelsea also have matches in hand.The match marked one of De Bruyne's final appearances at the Etihad, as the 33-year-old Belgian midfielder will not receive a contract extension when his current deal expires at the end of the season.""We are better than we were weeks ago. If we play like we did today, it is really good but we cannot relax. Winning in that way is good because it will make us realise that we still need to work,"" Guardiola said.De Bruyne's goal was only his sixth of the season, reflecting his injury-plagued decline over the past two years that influenced Guardiola's decision to release him.""A lot of teammates have said that it's sad I have to go, but that's just how it goes sometimes in life. I don't know what the future will be, but I know that I can still play here. I try to play as much good football as I can. I'm still enjoying it,"" De Bruyne said.""Just thank you. His contribution in the game against Crystal Palace when we were 2-0 down and he delivers, and today the goal again. I want the best for Kevin. It cannot be possible to have done these many years without him. He has been an incredible player but the situation is what it is. It's almost impossible to replace this kind of player,"" Guardiola said about De Bruyne.Erling Haaland returned from his ankle injury but remained an unused substitute, surprising many observers.Wolves entered the match with confidence after achieving six consecutive top-flight victories for the first time since 1970-71.The visitors nearly took the lead when Rayan Ait-Nouri hit the post from close range, with his follow-up attempt cleared off the line by Josko Gvardiol.City broke the deadlock in the 35th minute through a well-orchestrated move. Ilkay Gundogan passed to Jeremy Doku , who beat his marker and found De Bruyne unmarked in the Wolves area. The Belgian finished past goalkeeper Jose Sa.Wolves continued to threaten in the second half, with Matheus Cunha striking the post from the edge of the area.The victory keeps City on track to avoid missing Champions League qualification for the first time since 2010-11, though their four-year reign as English champions has already ended with Liverpool claiming the title.City still have three matches remaining in their campaign and can also look forward to an FA Cup final against Crystal Palace.",Manchester City beat Wolves 1-0 at the Etihad Stadium on Friday.

I’m actually speechless because you know it’s been a long time,” said Buemi, while feeling very relieved after taking a win he had hardly expected after so long.Buemi was Formula E's Season 2 champion and had won his last race in New York in 2019. On Sunday, he took full advantage in picking up the pieces from a Rowland lunge at the chicane on Lap 21 and gained a lead in the race.Opening up about the Round 7 race, Buemi said, “It was obviously quite tricky at the beginning with the fight with António [Félix da Costa] and Max [Guenther], but in the end the timing of the Attack Mode was good, I was able to make a gap and I was safe when Oli [Rowland] took his second one. I was able to read where the track was drying up, especially in Turns 3 and 4, there was lots of lap time to be gained, but you needed the confidence and today I had it.

Oliver Rowland on his winning strategy

Oliver Rowland showed who’s the boss on the first day of the Monaco E-Prix . The Nissan driver went on to win the Round 6 on Saturday, registering his third win of the 2024–25 Formula E World Championship . The 32-year-old hinted that they would have been enjoying the champagne after the sweet victory but since this is a double header, the party will have to wait till Sunday. The Round 7 of the Miami E-Prix is scheduled on Sunday.Talking about his quick strategy that resulted in a win for him, Oliver Rowland said, “You never know what to do with the strategy especially with these Pit Boost races - it’s the second race but we kind of had a plan and we stuck to it. It was a bit trickier to pass Taylor [Barnard] to be honest, but we kept calm - even at the end I was pretty worried during that second Attack Mode: I dropped back to fifth and I was behind two Mahindra's, and I was like ‘right now we need to get cracking’, but great job by the team and very well executed.”The 32-year-old added, “I was thinking Taylor was pushing the barriers of the rules at some points, but fair play to him - in the end we got the job done so it doesn’t really matter. We’ve started the season really well, but it feels a bit different now. Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne but you’ve already got one eye on tomorrow.”A key factor in Rowland's success was the strategic deployment of Pit Boost by Nissan, allowing him to overtake polesitter NEOM McLaren driver Taylor Barnard on Lap 13. Despite briefly losing the lead to Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries on Lap 26, Rowland masterfully utilised his final Attack Mode on Lap 27 to reclaim the lead, ultimately winning the race by a comfortable two-second margin.Also Read: Monaco E-Prix Round 6: Oliver Rowland wins, Nyck de Vries second, Jake Dennis secures third spot on podium despite penalty Rowland is currently on top of the FIA Drivers' World Championship standings with 94 points.

Pit Boost in Formula E double-headers

Nissan driver Oliver Rowland won Part 1 of the Monaco E-Prix on Saturday. He is already leading the Formula E Drivers' Standings this year, and the much-awaited win adds to his score. Nyck de Vries of Mahindra Racing secured the second spot on the podium. Andretti driver Jake Dennis managed to claim the third spot despite a 5-second penalty.The race began with qualifying winner NEOM McLaren’s Taylor Barnard on pole position, followed by good friend — Nissan’s Oliver Rowland — and then Cupra Kiro driver Dan Ticktum, who topped both free practice sessions.The race ended early for TAG Heuer Porsche driver António Félix da Costa, who crashed into the wall and retired. He remains the only Formula E driver in the last five years to have won both pole and the race in the same event — in 2021. He had finished third in the previous race in Miami.Mitch Evans of Jaguar TCS Racing, who won the last Monaco E-Prix, came to a halt during the race and struggled to get going again, losing precious time as others overtook him.Oliver Rowland was among the first to use Attack Mode and established his dominance in the race. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries and TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein came close to Rowland when others took the mandatory Pit Boost. Soon after, Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy moved up to challenge for second position.Where did pole winner Taylor Barnard go? He crashed into the wall and was seen reversing his vehicle to rejoin the race. Andretti driver Jake Dennis could have secured a higher podium finish, but he was hit with a 5-second penalty for overspeeding during the full-course yellow when António Félix da Costa’s car was being removed from the crash site.Pit Boost is a feature introduced in Formula E double-headers. The electric Gen3 Evo cars receive a 10 percent energy boost (3.85 kWh) via a 30-second, 600kW charge in the pit lane. However, a driver can use this advantage only once across the two races in a double-header.","Nissan driver Oliver Rowland won Part 1 of the Monaco E-Prix on Saturday.

With Monaco hosting a double-header for the first time, there are even more opportunities for new names—or different combinations—to climb the podium this weekend. But before that, let’s take a look at the six winners of the Monaco E-Prix so far.Interestingly, since the Monaco E-Prix adopted the full 3.337 km layout at the Circuit de Monaco, no pole-sitter has gone on to win the race.2022: Jaguar’s Mitch Evans started from pole but finished second. Stoffel Vandoorne of Mercedes claimed the win.2023: McLaren’s Jake Hughes took pole but didn’t make the podium. Nick Cassidy of Envision Racing won, followed by Evans in second and Andretti’s Jake Dennis in third.2024: Pascal Wehrlein secured pole for Porsche but also failed to finish on the podium. Jaguar dominated the race, with Evans taking the win and teammate Cassidy finishing second. Stoffel Vandoorne, now with DS Penske, completed the podium in third.The 2021 race was an exception to the recent trend. It was the first time Formula E used the full Monaco layout, and the pole-sitter went on to win the race. That year, António Félix da Costa achieved the double for Techeetah-DS. His recent third-place finish at the Miami E-Prix shows he’s still in strong form with Tag Heuer Porsche. Robin Frijns (Virgin-Audi) finished second in 2021, while Mitch Evans took third that year.Meanwhile, Sébastien Buemi of e.dams Renault remains the only driver to have won the Monaco E-Prix twice—and in consecutive editions. He triumphed in 2015 and 2017, during a period when the race was held biennially. On both occasions, Lucas Di Grassi (ABT Sportsline) finished second. Di Grassi is currently showing strong form again, having secured second place for Lola Yamaha ABT in the recent Miami race. In 2019, it was Jean-Éric Vergne of Techeetah-DS who claimed victory.The official Formula E Instagram handle recently shared a poster featuring the six different winners of the Monaco E-Prix, accompanied by the caption: “Will anybody join the exclusive list of #MonacoEPrix winners?”Also Read: Monaco E-Prix 2025: Formula E set for yet another double-header, here’s all about the most loved race of the year Predicting this weekend’s results, one fan wrote: “Oliver Rowland first, Jake Dennis second, and Pascal Wehrlein in third.” Rowland received plenty of support in the comments, with even the Formula E page noting: “A lot of love for @oliverrowland1 here.”","Mitch Evans, Oliver Rowland, António Félix Da Costa and Nick Cassidy are among the favourites to win this weekend's Monaco E-Prix.

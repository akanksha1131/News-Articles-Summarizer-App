NEW DELHI: Following Virat Kohli ’s unexpected retirement from Test cricket, his childhood coach Rajkumar Sharma has praised the 36-year-old for an extraordinary red-ball career and expressed hope that the batting icon will lead India to victory in the 2027 ICC ODI World Cup.Kohli, who brought the curtain down on a 14-year Test career just weeks before India’s WTC cycle begins with the England series, left a significant legacy in whites.Rajkumar Sharma, speaking to ANI, said Kohli’s absence from Test cricket will be felt deeply but saluted his contributions to Indian cricket.“I salute him for his tremendous contribution to Indian Cricket, and as a coach, I am proud of him for what he has done for the country and the example he has set for the youngsters. Emotionally, it hurts that we won't be seeing him in whites again for the country,” said Sharma. “ I appreciate and back his decision...Hopefully, he will be there to win the 2027 ODI World Cup for India and he will be 100 per cent committed to it.”ALSO READ: Virat Kohli's Ranji coach drops bombshell on Test retirement: 'He was preparing for England tour' Kohli’s Test journey began in 2011 against the West Indies, and though his debut tour was forgettable, he soon established himself as a pillar in the Indian batting lineup.

He also became the only captain to hit seven double centuries in Test history.Despite a dip in form in the 2020s, Kohli still delivered crucial performances, including a century in Perth last year.Kohli’s career has been defined by resilience -- whether dominating pace attacks in Australia, redeeming himself in England, or battling tough spells against spin and seam. His passion, discipline, and hunger for runs helped raise the standard of Indian cricket on the global stage.Though his whites are now hung up, Kohli’s story isn’t over.

Poll How would you rate Rohit Sharma's impact as a leader in Indian cricket? Poor Average Good Exceptional

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma , known for his calm approach and exquisite leadership qualities on the field, surprised many with a strong statement about the idea of natural talent in cricket .Speaking in an interview with senior journalist Vimal Kumar, Rohit dismissed the label of “naturally gifted” in a brutally honest manner.READ ALSO: Rohit Sharma breaks silence on ODI retirement, says 'I will stop when ... ' “Beekar hai (It's useless),” Rohit said when asked about natural talent and leadership.“Nothing comes naturally. To appear effortless takes a lot of effort. People don’t see the hard work behind what looks ‘natural’. Whether it’s being a player or a leader, it all comes from hours of work, not magic. I myself started out as a bowler,” he added.READ ALSO: Rohit Sharma hits back at criticism: 'Defending myself is waste of time' Rohit’s comments shed light on the myth of raw talent in Indian cricket , emphasising that behind every great performance lies immense dedication and preparation, not just innate ability.With 11,168 runs in 273 ODIs and a record highest score of 264, Rohit has proven his value in white-ball cricket. Under his captaincy, India won the 2024 T20 World Cup and the 2025 Champions Trophy, reinforcing his legacy as one of the game’s top leaders.Recently, the 38-year-old called time on his Test career, just weeks before India's five-Test series against England starting June 20. Over 11 years, he played 67 Tests, scoring 4,301 runs with 12 centuries. His top score of 212 came against South Africa in 2019, a turning point in his red-ball journey.Though his early Test years were inconsistent, especially in overseas conditions, Rohit bounced back strongly as an opener in the ICC World Test Championship. With 2,716 runs and nine centuries in the WTC era, he became India’s highest run-getter in the competition.While his Test and T20I journeys are over, Rohit continues to lead India in ODIs, with the same message: greatness isn’t gifted, it’s earned.","Rohit Sharma has dismissed the idea of natural talent in cricket.

Over the course of multiple peaks and troughs, and through thousands of cricketing battles during a turbulent 14-year Test career, Virat Kohli usually stuck to his guns. So it was with his retirement, as he resisted requests to pad up for one more series in England, foregoing the temptation of a farewell Test.A fortnight after he first expressed his desire to retire from the longest format to chief selector Ajit Agarkar, Kohli brought the curtains down on a stellar career spanning 123 Tests, in which he scored 9,230 runs and 30 tons.“I’m walking away with a heart full of gratitude — for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way,” Kohli wrote in an Instagram post announcing his decision.His decision has taken the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) by surprise. While he has been struggling for runs in the format for a while, the selectors felt his experience was needed for India’s upcoming 5-Test England tour next month.TOI has learned that Kohli had a talk with Agarkar even before Rohit Sharma, who retired from Tests last week, discussed his plans with the board and selectors. While with Rohit, the selectors and team management were contemplating moving on from him in Tests, in Kohli’s case it was difficult to change his mind.When the Indian team was struggling in Australia late last year, it appeared Kohli was amenable to again being at the wheel. He was more involved in decision-making on the field and regularly addressing huddles, like he used to when he was the captain. That led to talk of handing him the interim Test captaincy even as the selectors tried to bide time to find a full-time captain. BCCI sources said such an idea had been floated informally.The selectors’ planning was thrown off when Kohli communicated his thoughts to Agarkar during IPL. Even after Australia tour, he appeared very eager to carry on for a little longer. His fitness can never be questioned. He even turned up for a Ranji match for Delhi in Jan.“But he revealed the format was taking a toll, and it was getting difficult to go through another big and long Test series. He just didn’t feel right about continuing. BCCI asked him to take his time and revisit his decision. But he refused to back down,” board sources said.",Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after a stellar career spanning 123 Tests.

Kick-off time confirmed after scheduling conflict

Crystal Palace and Man City's journey to the final

Where to watch the game on 17th May?

Crystal Palace meet Manchester City in the 2025 FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium on Saturday, May 17. The action gets underway at 4:30 PM BST. Crystal Palace has been in their first FA Cup final since 2016, while Manchester City is hoping for their third successive final win.Kick-off was scheduled at 4:30 PM BST following discussions between the BBC, ITV, and the Football Association. The recall was made because it coincided with the BBC’s coverage of the Eurovision Song Contest. The earlier match time means it won’t clash with Eurovision in an attempt to keep all fans and broadcasters happy.The path Crystal Palace took to Wembley has been one of high drama, with their refusal to be cowed tactically while also wielding the sword in each round. They opened their campaign with a good victory over Stockport County before an assured win over Doncaster Rovers. In the third round, drawn at home, Palace played Millwall in a pulsating London derby, and came out on top with their fine attacking play and stoic defence. Against Fulhamin the quarter-finals, they won a tight game, and Eze once again shone, illustrating his imagination and coolness when faced with the pressure the occasion presented.They produced their finest display in the semi-final at Wembley, comfortably beating Aston Villa 3-0. Ismaïla Sarr’s searing pace and accuracy in the opposition half were a constant menace, and Eze ran the midfield with flair and vision. Manager Oliver Glasner has also been given credit for imposing both a distinct game-plan and self-belief in his side, taking Palace to only their third FA Cup final in the club’s history. Riding a wave of momentum and boasting a talented, hungry group of players, Crystal Palace go into the final as determined underdogs with a place in history on their minds.Manchester City's journey to the final saw them defeat Salford City 8–0 in the third round, in addition to wins over Leyton Orient, Plymouth Argyle, and Bournemouth, and a 2–0 victory over Nottingham Forest in the semi-finals. Rico Lewis and Joško Gvardiol were the scorers in the semi-final.The final will be shown live on BBC One and ITV1 in the UK, with talkSPORT providing radio commentary. Both teams are in eye-catching form, so the final FA Cup showdown promises to be a thriller for football enthusiasts all around the globe.Also Read: Manchester United crash out of FA Cup as Fulham win penalty shoot-out",Crystal Palace meet Manchester City in the 2025 FA Cup final.

Barca coach Hansi Flick’s dream start against Real Madrid

Real Madrid’s defense crumbles under pressure

Barcelona has made history by defeating Real Madrid in all four El Clasico matches this season. The latest was a thrilling 4-3 win at the Estadi Olimpic Lluís Companys on Sunday. With this, Barca are now just a few points away from lifting the LaLiga trophy. No other team has ever beaten Real Madrid four times in one season with so many goals. The total tally? A record-breaking 16 goals across the four clashes.Not even Barcelona’s German coach Hansi Flick, has had a dream run in his debut season, especially in El Clasico games.That result was a commanding 4-0 win at the Santiago Bernabeu — Real Madrid’s stadium — in October for Barcelona’s first official victory over Real Madrid this season. The second came in January's Spanish Super Cup final in Saudi Arabia, which Barca won 5-2 despite playing with ten men for more than half an hour. It was also Hansi Flick’s first trophy with the club.In April, Barcelona won the Copa del Rey final 3-2 in extra time with a late goal from Koundé. And on Sunday, in front of over 50,000 fans in Montjuïc, they sealed a 4-3 win that puts them close to the LaLiga title.All four Clasico wins under Flick had something special: high scoring, attacking football, and a never-give-up attitude. Scoring 16 goals against Real Madrid in one season is a new record. Even the famous Barcelona team of 2011-12 didn't manage this.As expected, Real Madrid started well but again failed to protect the lead. Kylian Mbappé scored twice early on Sunday, but Barca were soon on equal footing at 4-2 by the break.Madrid were missing their prime defenders, such as Carvajal, Militao, and Rüdiger. Their replacements, especially Lucas Vázquez and Fran García, struggled to stop Barca’s fast attacks. One major mistake from Vazquez led to Raphinha’s second goal right before the break.Kylian Mbappe did complete his hat-trick at the later stages of the game, but it wasn’t enough. This was the third time this season that Barcelona scored four goals in a short time against Madrid. Madrid now trails Barcelona by seven points in the LaLiga table with only three matches left. Their chances of winning the title are almost over.Also Read: Szczesny and Lewandowski families spotted celebrating Barcelona's ElClasico win",Barcelona has made history by defeating Real Madrid in all four El Clasico matches this season.

India's probable Test squad for England Tour

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti will leave the Spanish giants to take charge of the Brazil national team, as announced by the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) on Monday. The 65-year-old Italian, who will become Brazil’s first full-time foreign head coach in almost 100 years, is set to assume the role on May 26, following the conclusion of the Spanish league season.CBF President Ednaldo Rodrigues hailed the appointment as a transformative step for Brazilian football.“Bringing Carlo Ancelotti to coach Brazil is more than a strategic move. It is a statement to the world that we are determined to return to the top of the podium. He is the greatest coach in history and now he will lead the greatest national team on the planet. Together, we will write new glorious chapters of Brazilian football,” Rodrigues declared.Ancelotti's first assignments with Brazil will be World Cup qualifiers : against Ecuador on June 5 and Paraguay on June 10, both scheduled in São Paulo.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Though his contract with Real Madrid was set to run until 2026, it is now expected to conclude prematurely. Neither Ancelotti nor Real Madrid have commented publicly on the CBF's announcement.He will succeed Dorival Júnior, who was sacked in March after a disappointing 14-month stint, capped by a 4-1 loss to arch-rivals Argentina. Brazil currently sit fourth in the World Cup qualifying standings, while their star player Neymar continues his recovery from an ACL injury sustained in 2023.The decision comes amid a turbulent period for Real Madrid, who failed to retain their European title and were recently knocked out of the Champions League by Arsenal. They also suffered a 4-3 loss to Barcelona, who lifted the Copa del Rey, and now trail them by seven points in La Liga.Since Tite’s departure after the 2022 World Cup, Brazil’s coaching position has seen instability. Interim managers Ramon Menezes (U-20 coach) and Fernando Diniz (Fluminense) struggled to deliver results, eventually leading to Dorival’s appointment and subsequent dismissal.Jorge Jesus, the 70-year-old Portuguese coach of Al-Hilal, was reportedly in contention until Madrid’s Champions League exit accelerated talks with Ancelotti. Reports also indicate Neymar's father influenced the federation’s decision to avoid appointing Jesus, who previously coached Neymar in Saudi Arabia.Ancelotti will be taking on his first full-time international management role, though he has experience at this level, having served as assistant to Arrigo Sacchi during Italy’s 1994 World Cup campaign which ended in a penalty shootout loss to Brazil in the final.His decorated managerial career began in 1995 with Reggiana, following an illustrious playing spell with Roma and AC Milan. Ancelotti has since coached elite clubs across Europe including AC Milan, Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich, and Real Madrid, and has claimed five UEFA Champions League titles: two with Milan and three with Madrid.Ancelotti now joins a rare group of foreign coaches to lead Brazil. Uruguayan Ramón Platero briefly coached the team in 1925, while Portuguese Jorge Gomes de Lima shared duties with Flávio Costa in 1944. Argentine Filpo Núñez also managed Brazil for a single match in 1965.With Ancelotti’s departure imminent, former Madrid star Xabi Alonso is widely tipped to replace him at the helm. Alonso recently guided Bayer Leverkusen to a historic German league and cup double.Before his departure, Ancelotti still has one more title in sight, the Club World Cup as he aims to leave Real Madrid on a high.","Carlo Ancelotti will leave Real Madrid to take charge of the Brazil national team.

Marinakis Responds After Viral Sideline Clash

India's probable Test squad for England Tour

Nottingham Forest are on the verge of completing a season to remember. Under Nuno Espirito Santo ’s leadership, the club has secured European football and is still in contention for a Champions League spot a remarkable turnaround from their relegation scare just a season ago. But instead of celebrating, tensions flared at the City Ground.Following a 1-1 draw against Leicester City on Sunday, Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis was seen in a visibly heated exchange with Espirito Santo. The moment quickly drew comparisons to a similar episode in IPL 2024, when Lucknow Super Giants owner Sanjiv Goenka confronted then-skipper KL Rahul in full view of the cameras an incident that drew widespread scrutiny.Forest’s draw now means they sit seventh in the table with 62 points, needing to beat both West Ham and Chelsea in their final two matches while hoping either Aston Villa or Chelsea drop points. While their Champions League hopes hang in the balance, their guaranteed European finish is already a monumental achievement.Yet, the mood post-match was anything but celebratory. Marinakis appeared frustrated on the touchline, which many interpreted as disapproval directed at his manager. The viral clip of their exchange sparked online criticism, with fans branding the owner 'ungrateful' and ‘arrogant’ for his reaction.Amid the growing noise, Marinakis released a statement clarifying his behaviour. He insisted his frustration was never directed at Espirito Santo, but rather at the club’s medical team following their misjudgement of striker Taiwo Awoniyi ’s fitness.“I was frustrated around the injury of Taiwo and the medical team’s misjudgement of his ability to continue the game,” Marinakis said. Awoniyi, who had just returned from injury, was substituted on and had to limp off minutes later a blow that arguably shifted the momentum of the game.Espirito Santo echoed similar sentiments in his post-match comments, downplaying any tension and refocusing on the positives from the season. The manager and owner are understood to be aligned as Forest prepare for their final push.With two games remaining, Forest’s fate still hangs in the balance, but irrespective of the final standings, their rise under Nuno marks a new era of belief. As Marinakis himself later added: “Now is the time to celebrate what this team has done — and continue to dream.”","Nottingham Forest drew 1-1 with Leicester City at the City Ground on Sunday.

Nick Cassidy shares glimpses of his podium win and personal life



Nick Cassidy was a relieved man as he stood on the third spot on the podium at the Monaco E-Prix Round 7 on Sunday. The Jaguar TCS Racing driver confessed he was actually “jumping up and down” on the inside as he reached the podium for the first time this season. However, it is his third consecutive podium at the Monaco E-Prix, his home race. A day after the race, Cassidy made multiple attempts to at least share a post to mark his first Formula E win of the year before finally dropping a bunch of stunning pictures on his Instagram page.Nick Cassidy shared a picture of himself holding the trophy at the Monaco E-Prix Round 7 on Instagram on Monday, along with several stunning pictures of his family and more. He wrote, “Not on here much these days.. No other way around it - been a super tough start to the year and it’s great to have an awesome Podium in Monaco with @jaguarracing. 3 years in a row on the steps at home is super special. Thanks to all those in my corner.”Just before dropping the post, he took to his Instagram Stories to share a screenshot of his many attempts at making an Instagram post to assure his followers that he was trying to share at least one post on the special occasion.Nick had won the Monaco E-Prix once in 2023 when he was racing for Envision Racing and had taken the second podium spot in 2024 with Jaguar TCS Racing. Nick Cassidy picked his way through the field from 14th position on the grid to third spot on the podium in the Monaco E-Prix Round 7.

Oliver Rowland couldn’t translate his pole into victory in Monaco Round 7





There is no stopping Oliver Rowland , who had double gains at the recently held Monaco E-Prix double-header and is “really pleased” with his position in Round 7. The Nissan driver won Round 6 and had said, “Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne, but you’ve already got one eye on tomorrow.” He did keep the champagne celebrations under control after his win in Monaco and yielded results with his podium finish the next day.Oliver Rowland had won the pole position and was confidently leading in the first half of the race, but as if the pole curse continues to be in place ever since 2022, he couldn’t manage to cross the finish line first. It was Envision Racing’s Sébastien Buemi who ended his more than six-year-long wait for a win by lifting the winner’s trophy on Day 2 of the Monaco E-Prix. Only António Félix da Costa had managed to translate his pole into a victory at the Formula E Monaco race in 2021.Sharing his take on the Monaco race, Rowland said, “I think honestly when he [Buemi] took his Attack Mode, he knew I had more to do — I think he was trying to back me into the pack, so when I took it, I lost quite a lot. But, first and second here doesn’t get much better, so I’m really, really pleased. We just need to keep pushing. We’ve got Tokyo next week where I was really strong last year, so hopefully we can have a real big push for that double-header and then keep pushing in the right direction.”Many believed Rowland was in his own race as he took a three-second lead in the first half. However, he lunged at the chicane on Lap 21, and it was Buemi who surpassed him at the right time. The Nissan driver's move was later judged over-exuberant by the stewards, forcing him to cede the position to Jean-Éric Vergne in recompense, but the damage cost the DS Penske driver a crack at the race win, as Mahindra Racing's Nyck de Vries and Buemi made it by as Vergne bogged down in avoiding action.Rowland once again gave up the lead to Vergne as he took his final mandatory 50kW, four-wheel drive Attack Mode activation, to use that overlap of extra power and traction to push past Vergne and de Vries on Laps 23 and 24 respectively, for second place at the flag, some four seconds back from Buemi.Also Read: Monaco E-Prix Round 6 winner Oliver Rowland delays celebrations for Round 7: “Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne but…” Up next is the Tokyo double-header on May 17 and 18.

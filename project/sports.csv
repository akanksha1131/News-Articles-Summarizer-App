India vs England Old Trafford Weather Updates



India vs England 4th Test Pitch Report of Old Trafford



As the highly anticipated India vs England fourth Test kicks off at Old Trafford on Wednesday, all eyes are not just on team combinations and strategies, but also on the skies.With India trailing 1-2 in the five-match series, a win is essential to stay alive - but Manchester weather could play spoilsport.According to the Weather Forecast, Day 1 is expected to be significantly cooler than previous venues, with temperatures ranging between 15°C and 19°C.The India vs England Weather Report from the UK Met Office warns of cloudy skies throughout the day, and a 30% chance of rain could lead to frequent stoppages. The IND vs ENG Rain Update indicates that showers may remain a threat through most of the five-day Test.This overcast setup could favour fast bowlers on both sides, especially with Old Trafford weather often known to assist swing and seam under cloud cover.The IND vs ENG Pitch Report suggests that while the surface has slowed down in recent years, the added moisture from potential rain might revive pace-friendly conditions — a boost for seamers like Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, who are confirmed to lead India’s pace attack.Team India, still chasing their first-ever win at Old Trafford (four losses, five draws), is also battling injuries. All-rounder Nitish Reddy has been ruled out with a knee issue, impacting the team’s successful three-all-rounder strategy from earlier in the series.With Washington Sundar and Ravindra Jadeja still likely to feature, India may opt for a more traditional setup with six specialist batters, including Karun Nair and Sai Sudharsan.The unavailability of Akash Deep due to a groin injury has brought Anshul Kamboj and Prasidh Krishna into contention. Kamboj, who impressed during India A’s shadow tour, could get the nod if conditions favour seam.As the India vs England match weather update continues to dominate pre-match chatter, it’s clear that rain and cloud cover could be just as influential as any batter or bowler on the field.","India vs England fourth Test kicks off at Old Trafford on Wednesday.

Haryana seamer Anshul Kamboj has been drafted into India's Test team as a cover for the injured Arshdeep Singh and Akash Deep.The 24-year-old is all set to make his Test debut at Old Trafford in Manchester in the fourth Test starting July 23.Former India spinner R Ashwin , who has seen Kamboj up close at Chennai Super Kings (CSK), feels the youngster can be a really good addition if he makes it into the India XI.""With Bumrah and Siraj there, if you are bringing in Anshul Kamboj into the playing XI, I’m telling you, it’s a serious bowling attack,"" Ashwin said on his Hindi YouTube channel Ash Ki Baat.""People can say that Anshul Kamboj will be playing his first Test. But he was there with India A. He has been in cracking form in first-class cricket. He averaged around 13 last season and even bagged 10 wickets in an innings. He had a kick-ass Duleep Trophy,"" he said.Talking about what makes Kamboj special, the former India off-spinner said: ""Anshul Kamboj knows how to bowl a long spell. You need that in England. Anshul will be a really good foil for Siraj and Bumrah.""""One thing the management will have to look after is Anshul's nerve.Prasidh is also an option, but I will go with Anshul. He will give you that control and can also chip in with the bat.""He has a very good tappa. I have seen that in the IPL. His wrist position is very good, and he delivers a very upright seam. He never leaves his tappa.""Ashwin also compared Kamboj with Zaheer Khan and Bumrah.""The most appreciable thing about Anshul Kamboj is that he understands the plan. I have seen so many bowlers who, even after playing 30–40 Test matches, still don’t understand the plan. If you ask them about the plan, they just say they want to express themselves and enjoy the game,"" he said.""Because they don’t understand the plan. That is one type of bowling. The other is bowling according to the plan. Anshul Kamboj understands the plan and also knows how to execute it in the middle.""I have seen that. It’s not a trait a lot of fast bowlers have. Zaheer Khan was one of them—he was amazing. Jassi is another one. He understands the plan, makes plans, and executes them to perfection. Anshul Kamboj belongs to that variety.""",Anshul Kamboj has been drafted into India's Test team as a cover for the injured Arshdeep Singh and Akash Deep.

Poll Do you think South Africa Champions will win the World Championship of Legends? Yes, they are favorites No, India will bounce back It's too early to tell

NEW DELHI: AB de Villiers delivered a vintage performance to lead South Africa Champions to a thumping 88-run (DLS) win over India Champions in the World Championship of Legends (WCL) 2025 at Northampton on Tuesday.The Proteas legend dazzled with a 30-ball 63 - laced with 3 fours and 4 sixes - and pulled off a stunning relay catch in the outfield as India crumbled in a rain-hit chase. With the win, South Africa surged to the top of the standings with two wins in two, while India slumped to the bottom with one point from as many games.Opting to field first, Yuvraj Singh ’s side faced the full wrath of a resurgent de Villiers, who, after a rusty outing in his comeback game against West Indies, found peak form. Supported by useful cameos from JJ Smuts (30 off 17), Hashim Amla (22), and Jacques Rudolph (24), South Africa posted a commanding 208/6. Yusuf Pathan (2/26) and Piyush Chawla (2/31) were the pick of the Indian bowlers.India’s response was listless. With Yuvraj unable to bat due to a fielding niggle, the top-order collapsed under pressure. Only Stuart Binny (37* off 39) showed some fight as wickets fell around him. Rain stopped play with India reeling at 111/9 in 18.2 overs - far behind the DLS par score.Apart from Suresh Raina (16), Vinay Kumar (13) and Irfan Pathan (10), no other batter crossed double digits.It was a reminder of why de Villiers, even four years post-retirement, remains a force in any format. With this win, South Africa Champions look like early title favourites - led fittingly by their evergreen captain.","South Africa Champions beat India Champions by 88 runs in World Championship of Legends (WCL) 2025 at Northampton on Tuesday.

Poll Should Sai Sudharsan replace Karun Nair in the Test XI? Yes, he deserves a chance No, Nair should be given more opportunities

NEW DELHI: With India trailing 1-2 in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy and the fourth Test at Old Trafford looming large, selection debates have intensified, especially around Karun Nair’s place in the XI. Former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu has openly questioned Nair’s inclusion, urging the team management to give promising youngster Sai Sudharsan another opportunity.Nair, making a highly anticipated comeback to Test cricket after eight years, has failed to make a mark, scoring just 131 runs in six innings at an average of 21.83. Despite showing glimpses of his strokeplay, the 33-year-old has not been able to convert starts into match-defining innings.“Karun Nair has played three Test matches. He is a very promising cricketer, but his technical weakness has been exposed,” Sidhu said on his YouTube channel. “The big question is whether you will go to win or to build a team. When you think of winning, I think what is the fault of Sai Sudharsan?”Sidhu also praised Sudharsan’s recent form, saying: “You have one of the most promising players of India who won the Orange Cap. Yes, there is no connection whatsoever between IPL and Test cricket, but he was in form. Technically, one of the soundest low-gravity batsmen, whose hand-eye co-ordination and head is always completely above the toe, and a left-hander. Why shouldn't he come to the team?”23-year-old Sudharsan made his Test debut in the first match of the series, scoring 0 and 30, and has been benched since.However, India captain Shubman Gill came out in support of Nair, expressing confidence in his abilities. “He didn’t bat at his number in the first game and we have had conversations with him, and he will turn it around,” Gill said during the pre-match press conference.Gill emphasised that Nair remains an integral part of the batting group, especially after the retirements of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli from the format.With India facing a must-win scenario, the team’s middle-order combination will be under the scanner — and Nair’s performance, if picked, could well define his second coming.","Sai Sudharsan made his Test debut in the first match of the series, scoring 0 and 30, and has been benched since.

An emotional Mohammed Siraj on Monday opened up about the Lord’s heartbreak, where India lost the Test match by 22 runs. The last-wicket partnership between Ravindra Jadeja and Siraj had raised India's hopes. But Siraj was bowled despite connecting the ball with the middle of his bat.Siraj admitted it took a while to overcome the defeat.“It took a lot of time. Because that match was such that, in the last, in 2021 (at Lord’s), I took the last wicket (of James Anderson). Then, in such a situation, when I was there, I thought I could do it again…,” he told reporters at Old Trafford.Lion-hearted Siraj also opened up about why he gives everything on the pitch every time he dons the Indian jersey.(I play for my country). I always give my 100 percent,"" he said.""And since I do that, when I sleep at night, there should be that feeling inside that I gave my 100 percent… even if I didn’t get the result I wanted, it’s fine.”When asked about his workload management, Siraj smiled and said: “(fit, fine)… touch wood!

Former India coach Ravi Shastri feels Ravindra Jadeja lacks belief in himself, and that was the reason he couldn’t finish the Test match at Lord’s against England.Jadeja remained unbeaten on 61 as India lost the Test by 22 runs. However, the 36-year-old is in terrific form with the bat and has scored 337 runs in the series, including four consecutive fifties.“I feel Jadeja, if he has even 40 per cent of the belief that Ben Stokes has, he will win you a lot more matches. Because there is no doubt about his talent,” Ravi Shastri said on the cricket podcast Stick To Cricket.“It’s just that he will have to go and take charge and believe in himself,” he added.Shastri emphasized that despite scoring three triple hundreds in first-class cricket, it took Jadeja a long time to realise his batting potential.“He has got three triple hundreds in first-class cricket. It took him ages to realise that he has that batting potential,” Shastri said.Speaking about the Lord’s Test, he added: “One of the great sights of this series was at the end of the Lord’s Test, when Stokes and Jadeja hugged each other.

NEW DELHI: Former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar has thrown his weight behind India captain Shubman Gill , backing the young leader to bounce back in the fourth Test at Old Trafford, Manchester, with India trailing 1-2 in the series. While praising Gill’s leadership, Manjrekar also drew comparisons with former India skipper Virat Kohli , noting that Gill’s aggression differs from Kohli’s.Gill, known for his calm on-field demeanour, showed a rare flash of anger during the Lord’s Test when England opener Zak Crawley took too long to face a delivery, causing visible frustration in the Indian camp.Gill, clearly annoyed by the delay and interruptions, was caught on the stump mic shouting: ""Grow some f**** b***s.""Commenting on the incident, Manjrekar said on JioHotstar: “When Gill walked out to bat on Day 4, I expected England to give it back to him. After all, he had lost his temper earlier, and that’s part of the game. What disappointed me, though, was how it seemed to affect Shubman Gill. When something similar happened with Virat Kohli, he would get even more fired up and become a better batter. But with Gill, the effect wasn’t the same. He came out looking tentative.""Manjrekar further explained how the English players’ sledging may have played a role in Gill’s uncertain approach at the crease: ""Some of the sledging by English players included personal attacks.This might have been unfamiliar territory for Gill, especially considering that Indian players today often receive a friendly reception from touring sides. But Gill didn’t seem up for the challenge. The way he batted reflected that, and I have no doubt there’s a connection between the sledging and his uncertainty at the crease. ”Despite the criticism, Manjrekar remains optimistic about Gill’s overall progress and the road ahead: “Gill is a young captain, and he has already surpassed expectations, both with the bat and as a leader. The scoreline might be close, but India has won a Test match, and that’s credit to how he has gone about it. This eight-day break comes at a perfect time for him. He has good people around him, and his father, more than anyone, would know what kind of personality Shubman really is, whether he’s a potential Virat Kohli or Dhoni, or somewhere in between. """"I’m guessing somewhere in between. He has to find his own path now, a path that enhances both, his leadership and his batting. And, if there is anything coming in the way of either, he’s got to quickly let go of it. In the first Test, he was leaning heavily on Rishabh Pant and others. In the second, he started asserting himself, and the results followed. Now, after this little setback in the third Test, we might see the best of Shubman Gill, the captain, in Manchester. Hopefully, we’ll also see the best of Shubman Gill, the batter,” Manjrekar added.India, trailing 1-2 in the five-match Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, will look to level the series when the fourth Test begins at Old Trafford on July 23.","Former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar backs Shubman Gill to bounce back in the fourth Test at Old Trafford, Manchester.

Poll Do you believe Arsenal will maintain their dominance in women's football with this signing? Definitely Maybe, but it's not guaranteed No, other teams are catching up

Arsenal have completed a historic £1 million transfer of Canadian forward Olivia Smith from Liverpool, marking the first seven-figure transfer in women's football. The 20-year-old's move to the European champions surpasses the previous record of £900,000 paid by Chelsea for American defender Naomi Girma from San Diego Wave in January.The milestone transfer comes 44 years after Trevor Francis became the first male player to command a million-pound fee when he moved from Birmingham City to Nottingham Forest in 1979. Arsenal secured Smith's services after successful negotiations with Liverpool, who initially were reluctant to let go of their player of the season.""It's my dream to compete for the biggest titles here in England and in Europe and I'm excited to get started and contribute to doing that here with Arsenal,"" Smith said in a statement.Smith demonstrated her value at Liverpool last season, scoring nine goals and earning the club's player of the season award despite the team's struggles. Her versatility allows her to play both as a forward and on the wing, making her an attractive signing for Arsenal.Arsenal's director of women's football, Clare Wheatley, expressed enthusiasm about the signing: ""We're thrilled to bring Olivia to Arsenal. She's one of the most talented young players in the game and has huge potential for further development here.""Smith's journey in football began with her becoming the youngest player to represent Canada at age 15. She then moved to Sporting Lisbon in 2023, where she scored 16 goals in 28 games before joining Liverpool.""It's a privilege and an honor to sign for Arsenal. The atmosphere the supporters create at Emirates Stadium is incredible and I can't wait to have that behind me now,"" Smith stated.The transfer represents Arsenal's ambition to strengthen their position in women's football, following their Champions League victory. The club, which holds the distinction of being the most decorated in English women's football, has also secured the services of winger Chloe Kelly, Taylor Hinds, and Anneke Borbe on free transfers for the upcoming season.Liverpool, who finished seventh last season, plan to use the transfer fee to reinforce their squad. The record-breaking transfer signifies Arsenal's intent to maintain their dominance in the league while setting a new benchmark for women's football transfers.The transfer marks a significant moment in the development of women's football, establishing a new financial milestone that reflects the growing investment and commercial value in the women's game. Arsenal's willingness to break the transfer record demonstrates the increasing professionalization and financial capabilities within women's football.","Olivia Smith becomes the first seven-figure transfer in women's football.

PANAJI: Three months after the All India Football Federation (AIFF) declared Churchill Brothers FC as the I-League winners and hastily handed over the trophy during a ceremony in Goa, the federation announced Inter Kashi FC as the new champions on Friday.The announcement follows orders from the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), after the Switzerland-based tribunal set aside the AIFF appeals committee decision, which had adjudged that the re-registration of Mario Barco by the Varanasi-based club made him an ineligible player. Points were forfeited following a protest by three clubs – Churchill Brothers, Namdhari and Real Kashmir -- leaving them lower in the table.The CAS panel, an independent international body that settles disputes related to sport through arbitration, however set aside the appeals committee decision issued on May 31 and ordered AIFF to “adjust the points table of the I-League and declare Inter Kashi as champions.”The final points table leaves Kashi at the top with 42 points, two more than second-placed Churchill.Real Kashmir finished third with 37 points.“We won on the pitch, fair and square, but many could not accept that,” said club president Prithijit Das. “Our club is barely two years old, which played the I-League with heart and grit. Maybe because we weren’t part of the old order, false cases were filed, our integrity questioned, our name dragged. We didn’t give up. We went all the way to CAS, fought steadily, and won.”Significantly, this was the second win for Kashi at CAS in as many months after the Swiss body had previously overturned the appeals committee decision of taking away three points that were awarded by the disciplinary committee as Namdhari fielded an ineligible player (Cledson da Silva)“This win is not just ours. It’s a reminder of what sport should stand for; passion, fairness, and honesty, not politics,” said Das.AIFF was quick to readjust the league points table and officially declare Kashi as the new champions.“CAS has ruled that the AIFF shall declare Inter Kashi as winners of the I-League 2024-25. The AIFF congratulates Inter Kashi on being adjudged champions,” AIFF said in a statement.With the CAS order and AIFF’s statement, the I-League title race has now finally concluded, more than three months after the teams had played the last round of matches. On the final day, Churchill had their chances to settle the race on the ground itself but only ended up drawing 1-1 against Real Kashmir in Srinagar.Kashi, who were almost out of the race, turned the standings on its head after scoring twice in four stoppage-time minutes for a 3-1 win against Rajasthan United. The players celebrated at their home ground, believing they had come from behind not just for a win but also a memorable triumph.“It was a very difficult time for everyone at the club but in the end, victory is ours. We have won not just the I-League title, but our name and respect as well,” said Das.","Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) overturns AIFF decision to declare Churchill Brothers the I-League champions.

Why was the ban imposed in first place?

Poll What is your main concern regarding the return of away fans? Increased violence and incidents Allocation of police resources General public safety

Argentina's football federation has announced plans to gradually lift a 12-year ban on away fans in local leagues, which was originally implemented to curb stadium violence but proved ineffective.The first test of this new policy will occur during the Clausura tournament's second matchday when Lanús hosts Rosario Central.""It's a day that marks a before and after in our league,"" Argentine Football Association president Claudio Tapia said. ""It's the kind of football (with visitors) we all grew accustomed to since we were kids. We have to get back to that path. Clubs that are in a position to host visiting fans can do so.""The ban was initiated in 2013 following two tragic incidents: a Lanús fan's death during a police intervention in a clash with Estudiantes supporters, and the deaths of two Boca Juniors fans in a faction-related shootout.The restriction began in Buenos Aires province before expanding nationwide. However, violence persisted with continued deaths among ""barrabravas"" groups.Under the new protocol, 6,500 Rosario Central supporters will be permitted in the Lanús away section. The plan includes strict security measures and designated tickets for proper fan identification.""The idea isn't to go back to what we had before because the visitors were kicked out for a reason,"" Buenos Aires security minister Javier Alonso said. ""We have to eradicate the culture of violence. It's sad to see 10-year-olds singing about drugs or that someone needs to be killed. It has to be a family celebration, with flags and drums.""The initial implementation will be limited to Buenos Aires province, though other provinces have expressed interest in joining the initiative.The plan has faced opposition from some quarters in Buenos Aires. Critics argue that allocating police resources to protect visiting fans could compromise general public security amid rising crime concerns.The away fan restriction only applied to professional league matches and other divisions in Argentina, while international tournaments like Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana continued to allow visiting supporters.""This is what football fans and society want. Many matches have been organised with two sets of fans, and that's why we decided to announce the start of the return of visiting fans,"" Tapia added.",Argentina's football federation has announced plans to gradually lift a 12-year ban on away fans in local leagues.

Talking to FormulaE.com after finally clinching his second win in Berlin, he said, ""It's been a really tough few months, and it felt like I couldn't do anything right.I kept having problems; performance wasn't quite there, and qualifying was just too rapid, so I had to keep it together. Obviously, in the race, it was changeable conditions. I think the team really managed the strategy well. I had some problems after the pit stop, which allowed Pascal (Wehrlein) to get closer to me.”""So once it happened, I thought I might have to stop in the race, and I was just kind of like, well, that just sums up my season.

Other Formula E initiatives

Formula E has several initiatives running under its sustainability campaign. Among them is a youth education program called Driving Force, supported by PIF E360. It aims to teach children between the ages of 8 and 18 about science, technology, and sustainability. The goal is to reach over 50,000 students worldwide by the end of 2025.The Driving Force initiative comes at a time when there is expected to be a massive demand for 200,000 skilled workers in the UK for green jobs by 2030, according to PwC.Driving Force helps students learn about clean energy and the environment. It also introduces them to role models from the fields of science and technology, helping them gain the knowledge and confidence needed to consider careers in these areas. These workshops use fun and practical activities to show how what students learn in school can lead to exciting real-world careers in racing, clean energy, engineering, and more.On July 16, over 90 students participated in Formula E’s Driving Force workshop at Hammersmith Academy in London. The session was one of five workshops held at schools across London in July, near the London E-Prix race site in East London and Formula E’s headquarters in Hammersmith.Earlier this year, similar workshops were also held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and Miami, USA, during Formula E race weeks.Julia Pallé, VP of Sustainability at Formula E, said, ""A survey in 2024 of more than 7,000 UK secondary school students reveals a worrying downward trend in both their involvement in and their ambition to pursue STEM subjects — a stark wake-up call for educators and policymakers alike.""""Teachers are being asked to make stronger connections between subjects and careers, but they need support from employers to do that effectively. Driving Force, presented by PIF E360, is part of the solution to help the education system deliver what our students and our green economy both desperately need to succeed,” she added.Also Read: Taylor Barnard overtakes Antonio Felix Da Costa in Berlin to claim 3rd in Formula E Driver Standings Formula E’s broader social impact strategy includes several other initiatives such as FIA Girls on Track, the Better Futures Fund, and Inspiration Hour.

Lola Yamaha ABT’s performance at Berlin E-Prix

It’s not unusual for teams to introduce new designs for special Formula E races, be it for livery or driver suits. While Nissan’s cherry blossom livery at the Tokyo E-Prix was a hit and now NEOM McLaren will be racing in a striking white and blue livery, the Lola Yamaha ABT team did something absolutely unexpected at the Berlin E-Prix. Drivers Lucas Di Grassi and Zane Maloney literally wore Superman bodysuits for the race at the Tempelhof Airport Circuit. And just one glimpse of the same wouldn’t be enough.Ahead of the Berlin race, Lucas Di Grassi shared some interesting pictures to introduce his Superman bodysuit. He was seen jumping up in the air while sporting the bodysuit. He captioned it, “No CGI or AI involved. Driver was ok(ish) after the jumps.”A fan wrote, “Even the suit is made as Superman! Man, I love this season.” Another called it, “Sensacional!” A fan also praised “The verticality” in the picture.Lola Yamaha ABT had introduced him and Zane Maloney with the caption: “The beacons of hope. @zane.maloney and @lucasdigrassi are wearing bespoke race suits in a specially wrapped car this weekend, to celebrate our partnership with @warnerbrosde and the new Superman movie. Up, up and away!”The drivers posed enthusiastically on their Formula E Gen3 Evo cars and even jumped from them to get some perfect pictures to suit the Superman theme.However, Lola Yamaha ABT didn’t have a very good race at the Tempelhof Circuit. Lucas Di Grassi suffered a crash in FP3. Neither of the two drivers could bring in any points for the team. Di Grassi finished 18th and 12th in the Round 13 and Round 14 races, respectively. His teammate Zane Maloney finished 16th and 18th in the two races at the double-header.After the race, Di Grassi shared a post on Instagram in which he wrote, “We are one… team.

Antonio Felix Da Costa has penned an emotional note after a disappointing run at the Berlin E-Prix. He had held third place in the Formula E Driver Standings for a long time but has now slipped to fourth. NEOM McLaren’s Taylor Barnard delivered a strong performance in Berlin and replaced Da Costa in the top three.

Those who support me through the good times, but mostly the bad… you guys who are tireless and show me how strong our Portuguese race is.”He further added, “The dream of the championship ended last week, I dreamed, I dreamed big and so did you. Apparently it was the year of “2nd places”. Seems like I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time too often. 3 wins lost in the last laps because of safety cars, a few mistakes my mixture, the season could have been so different, but that's what it is in sport, and the bad moments, if used well, are the best thing we have.

Oliver Rowland’s journey in Formula E was full of ups and downs

Oliver Rowland shares his happiness on Formula E championship win

Things weren’t always well-planned for Oliver Rowland, who has just clinched the Formula E World Championship. The 32-year-old Nissan driver took major risks throughout his career, including walking away from a team without another offer in hand. He describes that time as one of the toughest periods of his life. But Rowland eventually bounced back, joining a new team and going on to win the championship this season.Oliver Rowland made his one-race debut in Formula E with Mahindra Racing at the 2015 Punta del Este ePrix, replacing the injured Nick Heidfeld. He quickly disappeared from the scene afterward.Reflecting on that strange start in Formula E’s second season, Rowland told Formula E’s official website, “If you go back to Punta del Este, I remember having no idea about anything when I arrived and leaving thinking, ‘I'm not sure I want to do that again, because it was pretty tough.’”He eventually returned as a full-time Formula E driver with Nissan e.dams in 2018. After delivering notable performances over a few seasons, he switched to Mahindra Racing in 2021. However, midway through the 2023 season, Rowland made another bold move — quitting the team without a confirmed offer elsewhere. Nissan brought him back the following season, leading to two remarkable years that culminated in him winning the Season 11 championship.Speaking about his decision to leave Mahindra Racing in 2023 after two seasons, Rowland said, “I took a huge risk for my career and for my family because my contract is what keeps us all fed and watered, so walking away from that was a really, really tough period in my life. I remember not sleeping for like, two, three weeks at some point. To kind of write the story and come out on the other side with the team that I started in Formula E with is just perfect. ”He added, “As a racing driver, a lot of days are bad, and you have to keep believing in yourself — that you're capable of doing it. Going into this year, I was confident that we would have a good chance.”Now, Oliver Rowland has become the Formula E World Champion in just his second year back with Nissan. “The moment I arrived in the championship and looked at the caliber of drivers here and the previous World Champions, it's such a good achievement for me to become World Champion. To be part of that is incredible,” he said.Also Read: Oliver Rowland’s rise to champion: Rare childhood moments highlighted in touching video Rowland will now race in front of his home crowd in London, where he’ll lift the World Championship trophy.

How Taylor Barnard surpassed Antonio Felix Da Costa in Driver Standings

This is 21-year-old Taylor Barnard’s first full-fledged season as a rookie driver, and the NEOM McLaren racer has achieved what many of his peers couldn’t. At the recently held Berlin E-Prix, Barnard put up a strong performance on the track, managing to surpass Antonio Felix Da Costa and take the third spot in the standings. With two races remaining, Barnard still has a chance to overtake Pascal Wehrlein for the second place.Taylor Barnard outperformed TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix Da Costa in Berlin. Da Costa, who had been comfortably sitting in third, has now slipped to fourth in the standings.Taking to Instagram to reflect on his Berlin performance, Barnard wrote, “Reflecting on Berlin. Definitely a weekend of what could have been, but we scored good points across both races, closing the gap to P2 in the standings. An unfortunately timed SC on Sunday cost us the chance of going for the win, but we will maximise our efforts to go into London as strong as possible.Taylor Barnard finished fourth in Round 13 and sixth in Round 14 race at the Berlin E-Prix, collecting a total of 20 points. In comparison, Da Costa finished 10th and 8th in the two races, scoring just 5 points — enabling Barnard to leap ahead of him in the standings.Currently, Oliver Rowland has sealed the Formula E Championship title with 184 points.Pascal Wehrlein holds second place with 125 points, while Barnard trails closely behind with 112. A strong performance in London could be enough for Barnard to overtake Wehrlein and claim second place in the championship.So far this season, Barnard has secured five podium finishes — one each in Sao Paulo, Tokyo, and Shanghai, and two in Jeddah — though he is yet to clinch his first Formula E race win.Barnard will now race on home soil in London alongside his McLaren teammate Sam Bird. The duo will sport a new blue-and-white livery and race suits. He recently shared pictures of him in his London-special race suit and captioned it on Instagram, “One city to go.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland’s rise to champion: Rare childhood moments highlighted in touching video The double-header marks the grand finale of Formula E Season 11, scheduled from July 25–27.","Taylor Barnard takes the number 3 spot in Formula E Driver Standings.

Oliver Rowland was worried after how Round 13 turned out in Berlin

Formula E Berlin Round 14 – 60‑Second Blitz!

Pascal Wehrlein’s Round 14 performance sealed Oliver Rowland’s championship win

Oliver Rowland looking forward to his home race now



Oliver Rowland’s fans kept their fingers crossed and waited with bated breath for the Nissan driver to seal his Formula E World Championship at the Round 13 race in Berlin on Saturday. But the day ended on a sad note for the driver as he failed to even finish the race, while his closest competitor, Pascal Wehrlein, clinched second spot on the podium, closing the gap between them in the Formula E Driver Standings. Rowland has confirmed that he did doubt his championship win when things didn’t play out well that day.There was reason to be worried for Nissan driver Oliver Rowland when TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein closed the gap between them in the Driver Standings to 50 points. He was second in the Formula E Driver Standings and could have changed the championship outcome with two more races remaining in the season.Sharing his fears in an interview with Formula E, he said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday) I was more worried that it might never come.”Pascal Wehrlein ended 15th in the Round 14 race on Sunday despite starting from pole position.Rowland eventually bounced back to finally seal his championship win by finishing fourth in the race. He missed out on the podium, which had Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy as the winner, but his 12 points, along with his closest competitor Pascal Wehrlein’s disappointing performance, were enough for him to clinch the championship.“I wasn't aware of where Pascal was at all. My engineer came on, I think with four or five laps to go, and said ‘P4 is good,’ and I thought that's a bit weird. Then I looked at the TV screen, and I got to about eighth, and I thought, ‘Oh, he's not in the top eight then.’ The next time I came around looking again, I found him when I started from the bottom. I didn't know if he'd had a problem, so then I was aware that fourth would be enough if Wehrlein didn't score, so I knew that myself. I didn't want to ask, because I didn't want to jinx anything,” he said.Oliver Rowland took to Instagram on Wednesday to share a post to mark his Formula E Championship win. Sharing a few pictures of his celebrations with his team, the Nissan driver wrote: “2025 FIA FORMULA E WORLD CHAMPION! It still hasn’t quite sunk in what we have achieved this season.

Jake Dennis eyes strong finish in London

Jake Dennis is steadily climbing the ladder back to form. The Andretti driver secured second place on the podium in Round 14 of the Formula E race at the Berlin E-Prix on Sunday. This marked his second podium of the season, following his third-place finish in Monaco. Dennis shared his thoughts after the race in Berlin, which also saw Nissan driver Oliver Rowland clinch the Formula E World Championship title.Just a day earlier, Dennis had retired from Round 13 due to technical issues with his car. He had also come close to claiming his first win of the season in Jakarta last month after starting from pole position, but an unfortunate collision with Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries cost him the victory.Things finally aligned for him on Sunday at the Berlin E-Prix, as he capitalized on an Attack Mode overlap to secure second place. The race was won by Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy, while DS Penske’s Jean-Eric Vergne finished third.Sharing a picture of the champagne celebrations on the podium at the Tempelhof Airport Circuit, Dennis wrote on Instagram: “P2!! Awesome race for us and perfectly executed! Great job by the whole team! A moment to say congrats to @oliverrowland1! So happy for you mate, world class all year! World champion looks good on you!”Speaking after the race, Dennis reflected on his recent struggles, having finished 17th in consecutive races leading up to Berlin.“We had a really good race car and the strategy we took into the race was perfectly executed. I had every opportunity to win this race, and we got pretty close. I’m not too surprised to be up here — I’m just super happy for myself and for the team. We’ve been on a real bad luck streak recently, so to reward them with a P2 is the least I could do,” he said.Looking ahead to his home race in London, which also serves as the Season 11 Formula E finale, Dennis said, “I’m excited to have this little boost going into the final stretch, my home race in London. It’s needed. It’s more for morale. Oliver [Rowland] has already won the championship, so massive congratulations to him. I’m super happy for him, he’s a good friend of mine.”Also Read: Nick Cassidy on Berlin E-Prix win: “I don’t want to take the moment from Oliver Rowland” Jake Dennis currently sits tenth in the 2025 Formula E Drivers' Standings with 77 points.

Nick Cassidy shares joyful podium moments from Berlin E-Prix

Nick Cassidy belted out Taylor Swift’s Love Story with his teammates after securing his first win of the season in Shanghai. He followed it up with a second victory in Berlin on Sunday, but the Jaguar TCS Racing driver was quick to shift the spotlight to Nissan’s Oliver Rowland, who nearly stole the show by clinching the Formula E Drivers’ Championship with a fourth-place finish. Cassidy has now opened up about his win at the Berlin E-Prix Part 2 — a double triumph for Jaguar after his teammate Mitch Evans won Part 1 on Saturday.Sharing his feelings after the end of the Berlin E-Prix, Nick Cassidy said: “What an awesome race. Firstly, to be honest, I don’t want to take the moment from Oli [Rowland] and the Nissan guys — World Champions with a whole weekend to spare is an incredible achievement. Well done to Oliver, he’s been a class act all year.”Speaking about the team and his race car, he added, “My guys called it perfectly. We had a really good car in the race. We kind of knew we screwed up in qualifying, and I was a bit upset about that, but the car during the race was fantastic—it was awesome. That’s three wins here now. This place didn’t used to be kind to me, but it’s become an amazing venue for me over the years, so it's really cool to have won here for three consecutive years.We’ve been improving all season—it’s no secret that Jaguar is back. The future for the team is very bright. They’re going to keep getting better, and I think that’s been obvious over the past few weekends. I had a fantastic car.”Nick Cassidy posted several pictures from his Berlin celebration on Instagram. Alongside images of him popping champagne on the podium, the 30-year-old captioned the post: “Yesssss! P1 in Berlin!! What a team effort. @jaguarracing.”Jaguar Racing responded in the comments: “That’s how it’s done, Cass.” Sergio Sette Camara, who raced for Nissan in place of Norman Nato, added several clapping emojis. One fan commented, “Massive congratulations!! That was another master-Cass, and I cannot wait to see you do a repeat in London — but from further ahead on the grid.” Another fan praised the team’s weekend sweep, writing, “Congratulations, Nick. Congratulations to the team for winning two days in a row!”Also Read: Berlin E-Prix 2025 results: Nick Cassidy wins Round 14 race, Oliver Rowland clinches Formula E World Championship In addition to his victories in Shanghai and Berlin, Cassidy also secured a podium in Monaco, finishing third in one of the double-header races.

Top performers Gabriele Minì and Kush Maini reflect on Berlin Rookie Test

Jak Crawford and Abbi Pulling share their Berlin Rookie Test experience

The ABB FIA Formula E World Championship Berlin Rookie Test, held at the Tempelhof Airport Circuit on Monday, was a surefire success. A strong contingent of 22 rookie drivers showcased their potential on track, with several emerging talents setting competitive lap times. Italian driver Gabriele Minì topped both sessions and set the fastest lap of the day at 57.643 seconds. Mahindra Racing’s Kush Maini and TAG Heuer Porsche’s Ayhancan Güven followed closely behind Minì in the two sessions, respectively.The highly competitive test saw all 22 drivers separated by a mere 1.5 seconds, as teams ramped up their development programs with rookie talent. Collectively, more than 1,000 laps were completed over the course of the day.Sharing a few pictures from Berlin, Gabriele Minì wrote on Instagram, “Fastest in Berlin. Very happy about the Rookie Test: a productive day with 96 laps covered, multiple race simulations, quali runs, and we set the overall fastest time of the whole #BerlinEPrix weekend. Thanks @nismo for this year's second opportunity after FP0 in Jeddah and for these brilliant days together.”Indian driver Kush Maini, fresh off his historic FIA Formula 2 win, continued to impress in Mahindra’s GEN3 Evo machine by securing the second-fastest time of the day.He appeared pleased with his performance in both sessions, finishing second in the morning and third in the afternoon.Reflecting on his experience with Mahindra Racing, he said, “I think it was a very strong day overall. We always made progress, and the team gathered some good data for London. Obviously, it's a different track, so we tested a lot of things. In the morning, we focused on 350kW runs, and in the afternoon, more on race runs. Whatever the run, we were always in the top three and really fast, so a good step was made. Whenever I get into this car, I leave with a smile on my face. ”American F2 race winner Jak Crawford also made a notable rookie return, claiming third place in the morning session while driving for Andretti. Sharing his thoughts, he said, “It was a great day testing in Berlin. I feel like we really got the opportunity to try a lot of setup items and gain a solid understanding of everything. It felt good to be back in the car, and I was able to get up to speed right from the start, which really helped us begin working on things early in the session. Hopefully, the work pays off and the team can deliver a strong result in London.”Abbi Pulling, one of the women drivers in the Berlin Rookie Test, drove for Nissan. She looked content with the day’s progress and said, “It was a great day—very productive—and we achieved everything the team needed. I’m happy to take on this new role with the Nissan Formula E Team, as it’s created a new pathway for me to experience machinery at the World Championship level. The morning involved a lot of runs focused on race settings and data gathering, and in the afternoon we did more push laps, testing several important items ahead of the London finale. ”Also Read: Berlin Rookie Test 2025 results: Nissan’s Gabriele Minì leads, Mahindra’s impresses in both sessions She expressed satisfaction with the improvements made during the day but added that she was still striving for more.

Poll What do you think is the biggest factor in Alcaraz's decision to withdraw? Wimbledon fatigue and recovery Injury concerns

World No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz has pulled out of next week’s ATP Canadian Open in Toronto, citing the need to recover after his run to the Wimbledon final earlier this month. Tournament organisers confirmed the Spaniard’s withdrawal on Monday.Alcaraz, a five-time Grand Slam singles champion, lost to world No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the Wimbledon final on July 13. The 22-year-old had been aiming for a third consecutive Wimbledon title.""I'm really sad to have to miss the National Bank Open in Toronto,"" Alcaraz said in a statement.

""Although he has been on the scene for a while, he's still at the beginning of his career and there will be plenty of opportunities for Canadians to see him again in the future.""American Sebastian Korda (world No. 33) and Poland’s Hubert Hurkacz (world No. 38) have also withdrawn due to leg and knee injuries, respectively.",World No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz pulls out of ATP Canadian Open in Toronto.

If

How do you, when beaten to the ground, bruised and busted, get back on your feet? Jannik Sinner knows.The 23-year-old wore his pain plainly in Paris, seated at his court side space, having finished at the wrong end of the five-hour 29-minute epic against Carlos Alcaraz.Five weeks later, on a dazzling Sunday in July, he punctuated a five-match losing streak against his arch nemesis, and brought a rivalry to life on Wimbledon ’s lawns. No tennis player has crossed the channel with greater purpose than Sinner, turning the Paris heartbreak to a memorable hurrah, his fourth Major title, and first in this leafy London suburb.The mental miles the 23-year-old Italian covered in the five weeks must anoint him as the sport’s newest mentalist.On the wall of the players’ entrance to Centre Court are the words from, a Rudyard Kipling poem: “If you can meet with triumph and disaster/ And treat those two impostors just the same.”In terms of expression, Sinner doesn’t give much away, no passionate celebration like Alcaraz on Paris’ red clay, just a smile that sparked his eyes. The turnaround was scripted during a stretch that features a diabolic switch of surfaces, from stubborn red clay to slick grass.It was when the Italian picked himself up, and in washing away the stains of squandering three successive match points, he underlined the size of his fight.There were big questions surrounding Sinner’s morale coming into Wimbledon. “This is the part I’m the proudest of because it has not been easy,” said Sinner, who tried to take positives from his loss in Paris. “It’s much better that you lose a Grand Slam final that way than someone kills you, you make two games.”The Italian’s coaches — Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi — discussed Roland Garros threadbare with Sinner for about 24 hours after the final but didn’t bring it up again thereafter.“For us it was important to move forward as quickly as possible,” Cahill said. “The week leading to Wimbledon was the best practice week we’ve ever had as far as attitude and form. We knew we had something special coming in. We knew that he had already put Roland Garros behind him. He was playing with real purpose. You could see that from the first match that he played, he wasn’t carrying any baggage from Roland Garros.”Following his win on Sunday, the world No. 1 leaves London with a hefty 3,430-point lead over Alcaraz.Sinner’s struggles of the last six months — when he served a three-month doping ban (February to May) for testing positive for anabolic agent clostebol — included the reactions of the locker room, most of who weren’t supportive of the Italian. A large section of the players thought the four-time Major winner had been treated favourably, add to that the vitriol directed at him on social media, and he was wading through murky waters.The 23-year-old, a methodical creature, turned to work, shrugging the weight off his shoulders. “We’ve tried to push at every practice session, I was struggling at times mentally,” Sinner explained. “Maybe even more in practice sessions because I feel when I play the match, I can switch off and just play.”Sinner’s win on Sunday was significant as much for himself as for this young rivalry. While the Italian is obviously too good a player to never beat the Spaniard again, the five successive losses across a near two-year stretch was beginning to gnaw. Sinner said, “When you lose several times against someone, it’s not easy.”Cahill pinned Sinner’s victory to the details. “You saw a bit more energy from him in the big moments, a bit more focus to knuckle down and make sure that when he had his nose in front, he kept on closing the door against Carlos,” the Aussie said.Vagnozzi added, “He was brave today, in the important moments he was really brave.”Alcaraz, the charismatic Spaniard, now leads the rivalry 8-5, but these numbers become irrelevant on the court where the margins are infinitesimal. Also, Sinner and Alcaraz are a level above the rest of the field.“Our level is really high, we don’t watch a level like this when other players are playing against each other,” Alcaraz said. “This rivalry is becoming better and better. We’re building a really great rivalry, we’re playing in the finals of Grand Slams, Masters, the best tournaments in the world. It’s going to get better and better.”That’s the bargain the Italian spent a little over three hours on Sunday signing on.",Jannik Sinner beat Carlos Alcaraz to win Wimbledon men's singles title.

Poll Will Sinner's Wimbledon victory change the future of Italian tennis? Yes, it will inspire future generations No, it won't have a significant impact

Jannik Sinner whipped a forehand cross-court that had Carlos Alcaraz scrambling to his right. The energetic Spaniard was on it in a flash. Two shots later, it was Alcaraz's turn to have Sinner on the run - moving to his right on a short, angled ball. The Italian responded with a cracking forehand down the line that looked destined to be a winner. In most cases, against most opponents, that would have been a winner or at least forced an error. Instead, Alcaraz took a couple of steps to his left, flung his backhand with some spin, and it landed in - much to everyone's surprise. The crowd on Centre Court was up on its feet.Still, 44 minutes into the Wimbledon final, Jannik Sinner could be forgiven for thinking about yet another title clash he had let slip. Just four weeks ago, Sinner was two sets up against Alcaraz in the French Open final. The Italian had three championship points, and failed to capitalise. Alcaraz went on to turn the match around to clinch his fifth major title.The script was turning out to be quite similar so far. Sinner led 4-2 in the first set and hadn’t put a foot wrong. Yet, Alcaraz elevated his level to bag four games in a row, including that seemingly unwinnable point, to take the opener.The turning point came a game later. It wasn’t a stellar shot, or a crucial juncture in the contest, or one of the many dramatic points played between these two new rivals in men’s tennis. It was a routine forehand that Alcaraz sent long at 30-40 in the second set. It gave Sinner the service break and the momentum, which he never let go of.Forty-eight minutes after seeing that ball land in, dropping the first set and possibly getting those flashes of Paris, it was Sinner’s turn to hit a remarkable shot to clinch the second set. The 22-year-old Spaniard’s angled backhand pushed Sinner to his left. The 23-year-old went down the line before Alcaraz forced him into covering the vacant court. On the run – seemingly with sliding shoes on – Sinner threw the kitchen sink at it, firing a forehand cross-court winner. “Unbelievable,” chimed the commentator. The crowd, on its feet, felt similarly, with the decibel level rising.The dramatics of that Paris evening on June 8 were not repeated – even if there were hints of it. In the fourth set, having taken the third, Sinner broke early like he had in Paris. But he never gave it back – unlike Paris. There was a whiff of danger as two break-point chances came and went for Alcaraz at 4-3.There were no signs of nerves, either, as Sinner closed out the match to win his first Wimbledon title with a 137mph serve his fastest of the day.“He needed that win today,” Sinner’s coach Darren Cahill said. “So he knew the importance of closing this one out when he had the opportunities. I think you saw a bit more energy from him in the big moments and a bit more focus to knuckle down and make sure that when he had his nose in front, that he kept on closing the door against Carlos.”The emotions at the end showed how much it meant to him. He raised both arms before going down on his haunches in the middle of the court and tapping the grass, as the applause grew bigger and louder. The top-ranked player then made his way to his coaches, his family, and friends including his brother, who didn’t miss it this time for a Formula 1 race!Sinner’s ability to out-hit opponents cannot be doubted. As he became the first Italian to win a singles title at Wimbledon, his mental fortitude stood out as well.“It’s the part I’m most proud of because it hasn’t been easy. I always try to be honest with myself. Things can happen. If you lose a Grand Slam final that way, it’s much better than losing where someone kills you by losing two games,” he said of bouncing back from the disappointment of losing the French Open final. “That’s why I said after Roland Garros that it’s not the time to put me down because another Grand Slam is coming up – and I did great here,” he added.Sinner had the champagne cork between his fingers during the second set as an overzealous fan popped some bubbly at SW19. At the time, all the Italian did was usher it to the ball girl, who got rid of it. “Only here at Wimbledon – but that’s exactly why we love playing here,” he said after the match when asked if he’d ever had that happen before. “It’s a very expensive tournament, you know,” he added to laughs.At the time, getting his hands on some champagne was premature. Now, with the job done, and deservedly so, he got his hands on the champagne, the trophy, and £3,000,000 in prize money.",Jannik Sinner beat Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets to win Wimbledon men's singles title.

Indian-American Ronit Karki may not have cleared the final hurdle in the Wimbledon junior boys event on Sunday, but the 17-year-old has done enough these last two weeks working his way through the qualifying draw and making the title round -to show that he’s a talent to watch out for.Karki went down 2-6, 3-6 to world No.6 Ivan Ivanov, the 16year-old from of Bulgaria, in the boy’s final. Earlier in his run to the final, Karki, ranked 52, took down No.9 Yannik Alexandrescou of Romania, No. 8 Jack Kennedy of the United States, No.14 Alan Wazny of Poland, and No. 12 Alexander Vasilev of Bulgaria. Karki played the J300 at Roehampton two weeks ago, making the third round, when competing for the first time on grass.The New Jersey-born teen, who trains in Florida, was just one out of the main draw, but said he wouldn’t change a thing about playing the qualifiers. “Everything is connected, so maybe playing the qualifying draw was a good thing, and maybe the reason why I’m here right now,” he said.Karki, whose family home is in East Brunswick, New Jersey, took to tennis because his father Trilok started playing the sport when he lived in New York with his wife Kanchan. “My sister (Naomi) started playing tennis too, then I just picked it up because my sister and my dad played it,” Karki said, “My dad is the reason I play tennis.”","Ronit Karki, 17, lost 2-6, 3-6 to world No.6 Ivan Ivanov in the Wimbledon junior boys final.

Poll How has Sachin Tendulkar influenced modern cricket players? Consistency in performance Mental toughness Playing style

Legendary Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar , widely regarded as cricket's greatest batter, celebrated his 52nd birthday on Thursday. Known for his unmatched consistency, longevity, and ability to challenge the world's best bowlers, Tendulkar's career spanning from 1989 to retirement saw him accumulate 34,357 runs in 664 international appearances at an average of 48.52, making him the highest run-scorer in international cricket history.Tendulkar's influence extends beyond India into all major cricketing nations, contributing significantly to the sport's current popularity, competitiveness, and financial success. Modern cricket stars including Virat Kohli, Steve Smith, Kane Williamson, Joe Root, Virender Sehwag, and MS Dhoni have credited their playing styles and match-winning abilities to Tendulkar's influence.Beginning his international career at age 16 in 1989, Tendulkar received his Test cap and made his ODI debut on December 18 of the same year. His remarkable ability to adapt and evolve his batting technique in response to injuries, team requirements, and varying conditions defined his career.In Test cricket, Tendulkar amassed 15,921 runs in 200 matches at an average of 53.78, including 51 centuries, setting records that remain unmatched. His achievement of playing 200 Test matches stands as a testament to his longevity.His One Day International career was equally impressive, scoring 18,426 runs at an average of 44.83 in 463 matches, with 49 centuries and 96 half-centuries. He became the first cricketer to score a double hundred in ODIs, achieving this milestone against South Africa at Gwalior in February 2010.A defining moment in Tendulkar's career came when he helped India win the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup . He contributed significantly with 482 runs in nine matches, including two centuries and two fifties, finally achieving his dream of lifting the World Cup at his home ground, Wankhede Stadium.Tendulkar holds the record for most runs in World Cup history, scoring 2,278 runs in 44 innings across 45 matches at an average of 56.95, including six centuries and 15 fifties. His knockout match performance included 339 runs at an average of 48.42 with four half-centuries.In the ICC Champions Trophy, Tendulkar participated in five campaigns, scoring 441 runs in 16 matches at an average of 36.75, with one century and one fifty. His combined ICC event statistics show 2,719 runs in 61 matches at an average of 49.43.Though Tendulkar played just one T20 International, scoring 10 runs, he found success in the Indian Premier League with Mumbai Indians. He scored 2,334 runs in 78 IPL matches at an average of 34.83, including one century and 13 fifties.His IPL career highlights include winning the title with Mumbai Indians in 2013 and securing the Orange Cap in 2010 for scoring the most runs (618) in 15 matches at an average of 47.53 with five fifties.Throughout his career, Tendulkar set numerous records, including 100 international centuries and 164 half-centuries, establishing himself as the most prolific run-scorer in cricket history. While Virat Kohli surpassed his ODI century record during the 2023 Cricket World Cup at Wankhede Stadium, Tendulkar's impact on cricket transcends statistics, earning him the title "" God of Cricket .""","Sachin Tendulkar celebrated his 52nd birthday on Thursday.

In an unusual incident during Wednesday's IPL match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Mumbai Indians , SRH wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan walked off after a delivery from Deepak Chahar despite no apparent contact between bat and ball, leading to his dismissal amid their batting collapse in Hyderabad.The left-handed Kishan, who had just scored his first run in the previous over, attempted to play a delivery from Chahar that was drifting down the leg side.MI wicketkeeper Ryan Rickelton collected the ball, but neither he nor the bowler appealed for a caught behind. On-field umpire Vinod Seshan was about to signal a wide.Unexpectedly, Kishan walked away, indicating he had edged the ball to the keeper, prompting Seshan to raise his finger for the dismissal.MI captain Hardik Pandya, who had made a half-hearted appeal, appreciated Kishan's gesture by patting him on his helmet and shoulders.Replay analysis revealed no contact between bat and ball, with UltraEdge showing no spike as the ball passed the left-hander's bat.While batters typically know when they've edged the ball, the decision was particularly significant given SRH's ninth position on the points table and the favorable batting conditions. Kishan's dismissal left SRH struggling at 9/2 in the third over.""You think you have seen it all after all these years and yet I must admit the Ishan Kishan's dismissal leaves me perplexed,"" commented Harsha Bhogle on X, expressing his surprise at the incident.","SRH wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan walked off after a delivery from Deepak Chahar.

Lahore Qalandars:

It seems former Pakistan captain and commentator Ramiz Raja had a bit of a slip-up during the post-match presentation after the Multan Sultans ' 33-run victory over the Lahore Qalandars in the ongoing Pakistan Super League PSL ).While presenting the award for the best catch of the match to Ireland's Josh Little of the Multan Sultans for his dismissal of the Qalandars' Fakhar Zaman, Raja, a well-known commentator, mistakenly referred to the tournament as the ""HBL IPL "" instead of the PSL.The video clip of this incident has quickly gained traction on social media.Meanwhile, the Multan Sultans celebrated their first win in PSL X by defeating the Lahore Qalandars in a high-scoring match at the Multan Cricket Stadium on Tuesday.Sultans' opening batsman Yasir Khan made a significant impact in his first appearance of the season with an explosive innings of 87 runs. This was followed by a strong all-round bowling performance, led by pacer Ubaid Shah, which restricted the Qalandars to 195 for 9 in their 20 overs while chasing a substantial target of 229 runs.Yasir's brilliant knock (87 off 44 balls, including 6 fours and 6 sixes) was instrumental in propelling the Multan Sultans to a formidable total of 228 for 5 – the highest team total ever recorded at the Multan Cricket Stadium in PSL history. He established a strong foundation with captain Mohammad Rizwan (32 off 17 balls, 4 fours, 1 six), putting together a quick 89-run opening partnership in just 45 balls.228 for 5 in 20 overs (Yasir Khan 87, Iftikhar Ahmed 40 not out, Usman Khan 39, Mohammad Rizwan 32; Rishad Hossain 2/45)195 for 9 in 20 overs (Sikandar Raza 50 not out, Sam Billings 43, Fakhar Zaman 32; Ubaid Shah 3-37, Michael Bracewell 2-20, Usama Mir 2-26)","Ramiz Raja mistakenly refers to the Pakistan Super League as the ""HBL IPL "" instead of the PSL.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

The competition for a spot in the IPL 2025 playoffs is heating up massively, with teams looking to pull off dominant wins in order to boost their NRR. Gujarat Titans (GT) are currently on top of the table with 12 points in eight matches and a NRR of +1.104. Delhi Capitals (DC), Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Punjab Kings (PBKS) occupy the second, third and fourth positions. DC have accumulated 10 points in seven matches at a NRR of +0.589. RCB and PBKS currently have the same number of points as the Axar-Patel-led side. However, their NRR stands at +0.472 and +0.177, respectively.Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), Rajasthan Royals (RR), SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) occupy the last four spots on the points table. KKR are the best placed with six points while the other franchises have won only four points so far. However, every side currently has a chance of making it to the IPL playoffs. Here's a look at what the teams need to do to qualify for the playoffs:Winning two out of their remaining six matches should prove enough, considering they have the best NRR currently. Sai Sudharshan and Prasidh Krishna are the current Orange and Purple cap holders showcasing their dominance across all departments. The Gujarat-based franchise have bounced back incredibly this season following an underwhelming performance last year. GT face RR, SRH, MI, DC, LSG and CSK in their remaining matches.The Axar Patel-led side will need to win three out of their remaining seven matches, having played one game fewer than GT. DC's NRR is the second-best in the league which will definitely play a crucial role with regard to sealing a spot in the playoffs. DC face LSG, RCB, KKR, SRH, PBKS, GT and MI in their remaining matches.The Rajat Patidar-led side has accumulated 10 points in eight matches, making three wins in the remaining six matches sufficient with regard to securing a spot in the playoffs. RR, DC, CSK, LSG, SRH and KKR are the teams they will be facing in their remaining games.Both teams will look to win three out of their last six matches in order to stay in contention for the playoffs. However, they have an inferior NRR in comparison to RCB's +0.472. While PBKS have a NRR of +0.177, LSG's NRR stands at +0.088 with 10 points in hand. Dominant wins will hold both teams in good stead, considering the immense competition. PBKS face CSK, LSG, DC, MI and RR in their remaining matches. DC, MI, PBKS, RCB, GT and SRH will be LSG's opponents.The Hardik Pandya-led side will need to win four of the remaining six matches. MI currently have eight points as well as a NRR of +0.483. They will face SRH, LSG, RR, GT, PBKS and DC in their upcoming encounters.The defending champions are in a tough position following their defeat by 39 runs against GT.

KKR are set to face PBKS, DC, RR, CSK, SRH and RCB.CSK and RR need to win their remaining six matches while SRH require six wins in their remaining seven games. The poor NRR of these teams could well prove to be a stumbling block. RR will face RCB, GT, MI, KKR, CSK and PBKS in their last six matches. CSK's upcoming matches will be against SRH, PBKS, RCB, KKR, RR and GT. SRH are set to face MI, CSK, GT, DC, KKR, RCB and LSG.Also Watch:","Gujarat Titans (GT) are currently on top of the table with 12 points in eight matches.

Poll What do you think is the main reason for CSK's poor performance this season? Injuries to key players like Ruturaj Gaikwad. Inconsistent batting and lack of partnerships.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

Chennai Super Kings (CSK) captain MS Dhoni has revealed the ""most ridiculous"" rumour he had heard about himself.When MS Dhoni exploded onto the cricketing scene in the early 2000s, his incredible power-hitting and remarkable fitness fueled widespread speculation about his diet.Rumours circulated that his daily intake included a staggering five litres of milk, and this was believed to be the reason behind him hitting those massive sixes.At a promotional event in Chennai, he was asked about this year-old rumour. The former India captain replied with a smile: ""I drink five litres of milk a day.""""I used to drink maybe a litre of milk, you know, spread throughout the day. But four litres, you know, it's a bit too much for anyone,"" he added.The former India captain also laughed at the rumour about him making lassi in a washing machine.He said: ""First of all, I don't drink lassi.""The 43-year-old is currently leading CSK in the absence of regular captain Ruturaj Gaikwad, who has been ruled out due to an elbow injury.Having already lost six out of eight games, the bottom-placed CSK will find it extremely difficult to win all their remaining six games to make it to the last four stage, which looks like a long shot at the moment.Dhoni rarely gives his opinion on any issue, but he didn't mince words in dissecting his team's poor batting. CSK have consistently failed to either chase or put up big scores.""I think we were quite below par, because we all knew that dew would come in the second half, and we were in a position to exploit the middle overs,"" Dhoni said, speaking about the lack of cricketing sense among the batters.",MS Dhoni reveals the'most ridiculous' rumour he has heard about himself.

The talented leg-spinner left Surrey last season to pursue further opportunities. He has played a couple of 2nd XI games for Kent, one against Zimbabwe A, where he returned with bowling figures of 0/14 in four overs, and one match against Essex 2XI, where he picked up three wickets in 10 overs.","Aryaman Varma, 18, was awarded the 2025 Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year award on Tuesday.

Poll Should the BCCI intervene in this situation involving Azharuddin? Only if evidence is provided No Yes

Huge prediction! KL Rahul would play in place of Rishabh Pant in 2026 T20 World Cup

Former India captain Mohammad Azharuddin has expressed deep disappointment over the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) Ombudsman’s directive to remove his name from the North Stand at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.The former cricketer did not hold back his emotions, calling the situation “heartbreaking” and a “complete disgrace to the sport.”""It pains me deeply to say this, but I sometimes regret having played cricket. It’s heartbreaking to see individuals with little to no understanding of the game now in positions to teach and lead. It’s a complete disgrace to the sport,"" he told IANS.Azharuddin, who served as HCA president from September 2019 to September 2023, said he intends to take legal action and urged the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) to step in.""I am determined to pursue legal action against this injustice, and I urge the BCCI to intervene and take appropriate action. This issue isn’t isolated – Sunrisers Hyderabad also had a dispute with the association over passes, highlighting a pattern of mismanagement and conflict,"" the former skipper said.He further added that the situation has become personal, especially after he was barred from contesting the HCA elections .""What’s unfolding is beyond comprehension, and it hurts me on a personal level. I was not allowed to contest the HCA elections, simply because I exposed the corruption within the system. That truth made me a target,"" he said.The decision to remove Azharuddin’s name from the stadium stand was taken by Justice (Retd) V. Eswaraiah, the HCA’s ethics officer, following a petition filed by Lords Cricket Club — a member unit of the state association.The petition alleged that Azharuddin, during his tenure as HCA president, misused his position by taking arbitrary decisions. It pointed specifically to an Apex Council meeting in December 2019, just a month after he took office, where a resolution was passed to name the North Stand after him. According to HCA rules, such resolutions require approval from the General Body, which was reportedly not obtained.","Mohammad Azharuddin has expressed deep disappointment over the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) Ombudsman’s directive to remove his name from the North Stand at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.

Bearded by Punjab Kings in their own den, Royal Challengers Bengaluru exacted revenge on Shreyas Iyer’s men in less than 48 hours. It was a quick turnaround. The good news: After eight matches, RCB are unbeaten in five away games. The bad news: They are yet to crack the winning code at home.Before the start of the season, their winning percentage at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium was less than 50% and it went south after three losses on the trot this season. Adding insult to their injury has been the performance of their ‘home boys’. KL Rahul, Mohammed Siraj and Yuzvendra Chahal , RCB heroes not long ago, have found success against their former team.On Thursday, when RCB host Rajasthan Royals , the only solace they will probably find is the four-match losing streak of the former champions and their inability to close out matches from winning positions. The absence of injured captain Sanju Samson and the inability of stand-in skipper Riyan Parag to deliver has added to Rajasthan’s woes.That said, Rajasthan also have some former RCBians in the line-up: leggie Wanindu Hasaranga and the big-hitting southpaw Shimron Hetmyer. Not forgetting Rajasthan’s orchestrator and one of Karnataka’s most-loved public figures, Rahul Dravid Nobody in the IPL probably knows the pitches at Chinnaswamy better than Dravid, who is still getting round in a wheelchair or crutches following an injury he picked up during the KSCA Group III league last month, understands that the Royals can ill afford any more slip-ups.Dravid admitted, “We know we must play well to be still alive in this tournament. You need to play well in critical moments, and it hasn’t happened to us. Every game from here on is very important and we’ve got to try and play the best cricket we possibly can and hopefully get the result.”","Royal Challengers Bengaluru hope to get rid of their at-home troubles as they host Rajasthan Royals in match 42 of the Indian Premier League 2025.

With many a fortress crumbling in IPL 2025 , seeking solace in one’s home turf is no longer an option for some teams. In all the talk ‘unfavourable’ home conditions by franchises, RR head coach Rahu Dravid has weighed in with his views.“One of the things about the big auction is that it’s a fresh start for a lot of players. Even though they may be your ‘home’ team players, they are playing for the team or on those grounds for the first time. When there’s a change of squad, the home advantage may not be that significant,” explained the former India skipper and coach.Citing examples from RCB and RR, Dravid added: “Someone like Phil Salt , who was with KKR, has come to RCB for the first time. Likewise, someone like Nitish Rana is playing for RR this year for the first time. So, for him, Jaipur is a new ground.” On their home turf, RCB batters have been guilty of gifting their wickets, and skipper Rajat Patidar didn’t shy away from admitting this. “Shot selection matters,” Patidar said, adding: “This time, the wickets are two-paced and there is variable bounce. So, I think the bowlers are getting a lot of help. However, the more we focus on hitting square of the wicket, the better it will be.”","Rajasthan Royals head coach Rahu Dravid has weighed in on 'unfavourable' home conditions in IPL 2025.

The mercurial Pant acquired for an alltime high Rs 27-cr to be skipper of LSG has been a shadow of his once destructive self. After nine games this season, he has aggregated a paltry 106 runs, 63 of which came in one game (against CSK).The strike rate, too, is 96.36, which is ridiculously low by his standards. For one, Pant hasn’t given himself the time to settle down in one slot, going up and down the order. It hasn’t allowed him his own mental freedom, so central to his game.His former India colleague Cheteshwar Pujara put the the lefthander travails in perspective. “Pant is trying too hard to be MS Dhoni , which he is not,” Pujara said in a post-match show, a point that former India wicketkeeper batsman Deep Dasgupta too agrees with. “As much as Rishabh tries to be Dhoni, he is fundamentally different to MSD.Dhoni was a player who used his head brilliantly to overcome the inadequacies in his game and become the player that he was. Pant, on the other hand, has a lot of heart and less head. His natural talent is greater, and it is important that he doesn’t bind himself overthinking his game,” Dasgupta, commentating on the IPL, told TOI.LSG, of course, is a demanding franchise which is desperate for silverware and franchise pressure took its toll on KL Rahul last year. But one understands that owner Sanjiv Goenka hasn’t been interfering at all this time around, letting Pant and the technical team do their job.What could really be hurting Pant then is the self-imposed clutter in his mind. He has already lost his place in the Indian white-ball set-up with Rahul and Sanju Samson taking leads, and the 27-year-old might just be feeling the heat. “It seems he is muddled in his mind. It is true that he is fighting for his place in the Indian white-ball side and that is probably affecting his thought process,” Dasgupta said.He said that Pant comfortably puts on his captain’s hat when fielding but needs to be “the free soul” that he has always been when batting. “Injury notwithstanding, Pant’s decision to hold himself back on Tuesday is baffling,” added Dasgupta, “If he thinks that Abdul Samad is better suited to give the innings the necessary push, then he is probably underselling himself.” With five wins in nine, LSG are very much still in the reckoning for a top-four berth, and that is a sliver of hope for skipper and franchise. But with Nicholas Pooran ’s form slightly dipping at a crucial stage, it is important that Pant pulls himself out of this recent white-ball mess of his own making.Poor form is a dangerous thing, and it can easily permeate into his red-ball game as well. With India embarking on a crucial five-Test series to England just after the IPL, every Indian cricket follower will hope that Pant rediscovers his touch by the end of May.",Rishabh Pant has been a shadow of his once destructive self.

: In continuing to be unpredictable, Sunrisers Hyderabad hastened their doom. On Wednesday when Mumbai Indians held all the aces at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, the hosts, beset by a variety of problems, not adapting to situations being one of them, were so dismal that the vociferous crowd soon switched loyalties after the teams lined up to pay a minute’s silent tribute to the victims of Pahalgam terror attack Hardik Pandya got everything right, including the toss on a pitch where the Sunrisers had pummelled Rajasthan Royals and Punjab Kings into submission. His move to put the hosts in was fully justified with Deepak Chahar and ‘player of the match’ Trent Boult striking early to restrict SRH to 143/8.Given that low totals are tricky, Mumbai, peaking at the right time this season, shunned risk and clinically finished the contest with 4.2 overs to spare for their fourth straight win. Despite losing his opening partner Ryan Rickelton cheaply as Jaydev Unadkat clung on to a return catch, and first leg hero Will Jacks after a 64-run stand for the second wicket, Rohit Sharma showed his class as he cruised to 70 (46b, 8x4, 3x6).His second straight halfcentury and the 53-run third wicket stand with Suryakumar Yadav (40*; 19b, 5x4, 2x6) completed a seven–wicket win which was set up by their bowlers. Chahar was brilliant as SRH failed to score off the bat in the first over of an innings for the seventh time. Boult dismissed Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma as batsman after SRH batsman played into MI’s hands.In between, Chahar scalped Ishan Kishan. The No. 3 batter, who has scored 33 runs in seven innings after his ton on debut for SRH, made it easy for umpire Vinod Seshan by walking. The ‘Snicko’ later showed he had not edged the waft down the legside.Nitish Kumar Reddy failed to clear the infield and with two wickets apiece, Chahar and Boult reduced SRH to 13/4 inside five overs and 24/4 in the Powerplay — the worst this season. Heinrich Klaasen (71; 44b, 9x4, 2x6) was the sole bright spot in the SRH innings.The South African was calm as the carnage unfolded at the other end. He watched as Aniket Verma succumbed to Pandya’s short delivery, and essayed a knock that showed good things come to those who wait. Abhinav Manohar played a good hand as an Impact sub and added 99 runs for the sixth wicket (63b) with Klaasen..","Hardik Pandya got everything right, including the toss on a pitch where the Sunrisers had pummelled Rajasthan Royals and Punjab Kings into submission.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians extended their winning streak to four matches with a commanding seven-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad in their IPL 2025 clash at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Wednesday.Riding on Rohit Sharma ’s classy 70 off 46 balls and another clinical all-round performance, MI chased down the modest target of 144 with ease, finishing at 146/3 in just 15.4 overs.This emphatic win propelled Mumbai from sixth to third on the points table, with their Net Run Rate also receiving a significant boost.Rohit, continuing his resurgence with a second consecutive half-century, looked in sublime touch as he struck eight fours and three sixes. He received strong support from Suryakumar Yadav, who provided the finishing touches with a blazing unbeaten 40 off just 19 balls, studded with five boundaries and two sixes.The match was effectively decided within the powerplay itself as Sunrisers Hyderabad crumbled to 35/5 following a top-order collapse. Trent Boult (4/26) and Deepak Chahar (2/12) ran through the SRH lineup with sharp, disciplined bowling. The only resistance came from Heinrich Klaasen and impact sub Abhinav Manohar, who stitched a 99-run stand to lift their team from complete disaster.Klaasen top-scored with a fluent 71 off 44 deliveries, including nine fours and two sixes, while Manohar added a patient 43 off 37. Despite their efforts, the total of 143/8 was never going to be enough against a rampaging MI batting unit.Interestingly, the match had its share of drama. Ishan Kishan walked off voluntarily after nicking one down leg — a moment of rare honesty — even as the umpire had initially signaled a wide. The umpire raised his finger only after Kishan began his walk, despite no appeal from the fielding side.The five-time champions had also beaten SRH earlier in the season and now look poised for a strong push towards the playoffs.For SRH, the loss is another blow in an already faltering campaign. They remain second-last on the table with just two wins from eight games, and their top-order’s lack of confidence continues to haunt them.","Mumbai Indians beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by seven wickets in IPL 2025 clash.

CHENNAI: After a nightmarish Indian Super League campaign, where they did not even come close to qualifying for the playoffs, Chennaiyin FC will be eager to salvage some pride in the Super Cup in Bhubaneswar. Chennaiyin will begin their run with a challenging round-of-16 fixture against ISL big gun Mumbai City FC on Wednesday.The knockout tournament offers CFC another opportunity to end a long wait – while Chennaiyin have not won silverware since their 2017-18 ISL triumph, they have not been at the continental level since the 2018-19 season. For CFC to pose a threat, they will have to stay “consistent”, a quality that head coach Owen Coyle believes they lacked in the ISL.“When we are at our best, we can stand toe-to-toe with the best teams. The cup competition is a great opportunity for everybody, because there is an AFC spot up for grabs. There is an incentive for everyone to go and win the cup,” Coyle said.“We started the ISL season well and finished strongly. We had a poor middle section of the season. For sure, there is added motivation to finish the season on a high. We were very inconsistent in the ISL; that is what cost us a place in the top-six. We have to get back to giving good performances consistently,” added Coyle.Chennaiyin should show drastic improvement in the defensive department, after keeping only four clean sheets in the league stage of the ISL. The luxury to use both Ryan Edwards and Elsinho at the heart of defence at the same time – a club can field a maximum of six foreigners – could solve some issues for the chief coach.Coyle acknowledged that there is a huge scope for improvement in defence but stressed that the team would not get into a shell for the sake of a clean sheet. “That (poor defending) was the biggest thing that hurt us in the ISL; we did not defend well enough. But in cup competitions, you have to win games. We will certainly not be seeing a more defensive approach; we will see a team going out to win games,” said Coyle.What should give CFC a bit of hope for Wednesday’s game is the fact that Mumbai could miss a few key players due to different reasons (injuries, rehabilitation and personal situation). While Jon Toral and Jayesh Rane have been ruled out of the tournament, Yoell van Nieff, Jeremy Manzorro and Prabir Das are doubtful starters for the clash on Wednesday.Asked if CFC will have the upper hand, Coyle replied: “We are under no illusion; Mumbai are a wonderful side. Van Nieff and Manzorro could probably make it to the game. They have many good Indian players like Lallianzuala Chhangte, Vikram Pratap Singh and Mehtab Singh who add to the mix.”",Chennaiyin FC face Mumbai City FC in the Indian Super League (ISL) Super Cup.

Liverpool are on the verge of securing their second Premier League title, needing just three points from their remaining five matches to become champions. Arsenal's victory over Ipswich Town has pushed the earliest possible title confirmation date to Wednesday (April 23), when Arsenal face Crystal Palace.Liverpool currently sit at the top of the Premier League table with 79 points after 33 games played, holding a commanding 13-point lead over second-placed Arsenal, who have 66 points.The Reds require only three points from their available 15 to mathematically secure their 20th overall league title. Even if Arsenal win all their remaining matches, they can only reach 81 points, while Liverpool would have 82 points with just one more victory.The title race could be decided as early as Wednesday if Arsenal lose to Crystal Palace at home. In this scenario, Arsenal would remain on 66 points with only 12 points left to play for, making it mathematically impossible to catch Liverpool.Should Arsenal defeat Crystal Palace, Liverpool could still clinch the title on Sunday (April 27), with a victory over Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield. This would put Arne Slot's team 13 points ahead with only four matches remaining.The current Premier League standings show Liverpool in first place with 79 points and a goal difference of +44, while Arsenal occupy second position with 66 points and a +34 goal difference. Third place follows with 60 points and a +14 goal difference.Arsenal's win at Ipswich Town on Sunday eliminated the possibility of Liverpool securing the title that day, shifting the focus to the upcoming midweek fixtures as the next potential title-deciding moment.The title race has now entered its final phase with just five weekends of action remaining in the 2024/25 Premier League season. Both teams have challenging fixtures ahead as they navigate through the closing stages of the campaign.This upcoming period will determine whether Liverpool can maintain their substantial lead and secure their second Premier League title, or if Arsenal can mount an unlikely late challenge in the remaining matches.","Liverpool currently sit at the top of the Premier League table with 79 points after 33 games played.

SUBSCRIBE NOW! Liverpool fulfilled their half of the equation, but second-placed Arsenal were not so obliging earlier in the afternoon.The Gunners' stroll at Portman Road meant Liverpool kicked off still needing six points from their last six games to seal a first title since 2020.Thanks to Alexander-Arnold's match-winning contribution after coming off the bench, Liverpool are 13 points clear of Arsenal with five games left for both teams.The Reds will seal the title if Arsenal lose at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday or if they beat Tottenham at Anfield on April 27.It looked like being a frustrating day for Liverpool as second-bottom Leicester kept them at bay despite a host of chances for the visitors.Slot's men finally made the breakthrough in the 76th minute when Alexander-Arnold lashed home the rebound from close-range after Mohamed Salah and Diogo Jota both hit the crossbar.With speculation mounting that Alexander-Arnold will join Real Madrid when his contract expires at the end of the season, it was notable that the England right-back embarked on a wild celebration of his winner.Alexander-Arnold earned a booking for ripping off his shirt and planting it on the corner flag after he sprinted to 3,000 jubilant Liverpool fans in one corner of the King Power.""It took us a long time and, of course, a great moment for Trent after working so hard to come back. To score the goal that makes a lot of difference is very special,"" Slot said.""It's never hard to dream (of the title) but you see we are really focused on playing Tottenham.""Liverpool's title celebration is only a matter of time but Leicester will spend next season in the Championship after their woeful one-year stay in the top tier came to an end with a 23rd defeat in 33 league games.Fresh from a famous victory over Real Madrid on Wednesday to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time since 2009, Arsenal ensured Liverpool would not be able to start their party this weekend.Mikel Arteta made only three changes from the 2-1 win in the Spanish capital and was rewarded with a dominant display to kill the game off inside half an hour.""All we can do is delay that moment (Liverpool win the league) from our side to earn the right to finish as high as possible,"" Arteta said.Leandro Trossard was one of those recalled by Arteta and prodded in his eighth goal of the season to open the scoring.A flowing move saw Bukayo Saka's cross flicked by Mikel Merino into the path of Gabriel Martinelli to finish to double the Gunners lead.Moments later, Saka was chopped down by an awful challenge from Leif Davis that saw the Ipswich left-back shown a straight red card.Trossard fired in his second after a well-worked corner before Ethan Nwaneri's deflected effort rounded off the scoring.Defeat realistically ends third-bottom Ipswich's hope of maintaining their Premier League status as they are 15 points adrift of safety with five games remaining and have a significantly poorer goal difference than West Ham.Chelsea needed two late goals at Fulham to revive their chances of Champions League football next season with a dramatic 2-1 victory.Alex Iwobi opened the scoring on 20 minutes and Chelsea were meandering towards a damaging defeat until 19-year-old substitute Tyrique George fired in a snap shot from the edge of the box on 83 minutes.Pedro Neto then completed the comeback with a stunning strike in stoppage-time to secure Chelsea's sixth win in their last 17 league games.Fifth-placed Chelsea moved above Nottingham Forest, who travel to Tottenham on Monday.

Manchester City bolstered their bid to qualify for the Champions League with a dramatic 2-0 win at Everton , while Southampton 's last-gasp equaliser at West Ham ensured they will not have sole possession of the lowest points total in Premier League history.City were heading towards a damaging draw before Nico O'Reilly's 84th minute strike put them on course for a vital victory that was sealed by Mateo Kovacic's goal in the final seconds.Pep Guardiola's side climb to fourth place, four points ahead of sixth-placed Chelsea, who face Fulham on Sunday in their game in hand.Fifth-placed Nottingham Forest , who travel to Tottenham on Monday, are one point adrift of City.At a stage of the season when they are usually embroiled in a battle to win the title, City -- champions in six of the previous seven campaigns -- have been reduced to scrapping for a Champions League berth after a dismal season.They remain on course to achieve their bare minimum target after a hard-fought success on Merseyside.In the 84th minute, Matheus Nunes's low cross into the six-yard box was met by the 20-year-old O'Reilly, who got in front of Michael Keane to poke home from close range.O'Reilly has emerged as an unlikely hero for City after the Manchester-born midfielder scored last week in the win against Crystal Palace and netted twice against Plymouth in the FA Cup.Kovacic wrapped up City's victory on their last visit to Goodison Park before Everton move to a new stadium next season.The Croatian guided Ilkay Gundogan's pass into the bottom corner to give City a third win from their last four league games.""To win here at Goodison Park, where Liverpool and Arsenal couldn't, is massively important,"" Guardiola said.""Now it is in our hands. Three games at home, two away and hopefully we can achieve this big success to qualify for the Champions League.""Relegated Southampton rescued a 1-1 draw at West Ham to guarantee they won't have the indignity of being the lone club with the Premier League's worst ever points tally.Jarrod Bowen struck for the Hammers in the 47th minute, holding off Ryan Manning before lashing a fierce finish past Aaron Ramsdale.But Lesley Ugochukwu equalised three minutes into second half stoppage-time as he lashed past Alphonse Areola.Bottom of the table Southampton are now on 11 points -- the same number Derby managed in 2007-08 -- and have five games left to leave the Rams with the lowest total ever recorded in the Premier League.Brentford beat 10-man Brighton 4-2 to damage the Seagulls' prospects of qualifying for Europe with their first home win since December.Thomas Frank's side took a ninth minute lead when Lewis Keane-Potter's precise pass through the heart of the Brighton defence picked out Bryan Mbeumo and he confidently slotted homeDanny Welbeck hauled Brighton level in first half stoppage-time with a powerful header from Mats Wieffer's cross.Mbeumo restored Brentford's advantage three minutes after half-time, his strike taking a hefty deflection off Brighton defender Lewis Dunk on its way past Bart Verbruggen.Yoane Wissa bagged Brentford's third in the 58th minute, running onto Mbeumo's pass and finishing with the help of a deflection off Jan Paul van Hecke.Brighton striker Joao Pedro was sent off in the 61st minute for a needless kick at Nathan Collins.Japan forward Kaoru Mitoma reduced the deficit in the 81st minute, but Christian Norgaard headed home in stoppage-time to end Brighton's hopes of a late escape.Crystal Palace held on for a 0-0 draw against Bournemouth despite playing half the match with 10 men.Palace were reduced to 10 men just before half-time at Selhurst Park when Chris Richards was sent off for a second booking after the defender fouled Justin Kluivert.Third-placed Newcastle will look to step up their Champions League qualification surge when they travel to Aston Villa in Saturday's late game.",Manchester City beat Everton 2-0 in English Premier League.

After trailing 3-1 with less than 30 minutes remaining, Barcelona's Dani Olmo and Raphinha , who scored twice including a 98th-minute penalty, secured the crucial victory.Barcelona took an early lead through Ferran Torres in the 12th minute, who scored from the edge of the box after finding space in Celta's defence.Celta Vigo responded quickly, with Borja Iglesias equalising three minutes later. Pablo Duran's cross found Iglesias, who scored into an empty net after goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny failed to intercept.Barcelona's attempts to regain the lead saw Raphinha sending a free-kick over the bar and Robert Lewandowski missing the target. Szczesny made important saves from Ilaix Moriba and Iker Losada at the other end.Iglesias put Celta ahead early in the second half, capitalizing on Frenkie de Jong's error to score past Szczesny. He later completed his hat-trick after being set up by Sergio Carreira, taking advantage of Barcelona's high defensive line.""This is football, we really wanted to win, maybe we weren't at our best but the response from the team, and the fans pushed us on... we deserved it,"" Olmo told DAZN. ""These are three points that take us closer to our objective, they're important and we have to continue.""Barcelona coach Hansi Flick had initially rested 17-year-old Lamine Yamal for the first time in 2025 but brought him on after Iglesias' third goal.The comeback began when Raphinha assisted Olmo, who beat goalkeeper Vicente Guaita. Raphinha then scored himself, heading in Yamal's cross from the right.Celta missed a chance to secure the win when Oscar Mingueza headed wide from close range in the 90th minute.The decisive moment came in the 96th minute when VAR review led to a penalty after Yoel Lago fouled Olmo. With Lewandowski substituted, Raphinha converted the spot-kick into the top-right corner.""It's a bittersweet feeling... we scored three, which few teams can do here, but it feels bad,"" said Celta's Duran. ""We have to be proud of our team, we came here with personality, played well, had a good plan and carried it out -- but for small details it got away from us.""The victory maintains Barcelona's strong position in the title race, with Real Madrid set to face Athletic Bilbao on Sunday and a Clasico matchup scheduled for May.Celta Vigo, currently seventh in La Liga and competing for European qualification, showed attacking prowess throughout the match despite the eventual defeat.","Barcelona come from behind to defeat Celta Vigo 4-3 in La Liga.

Manchester, Apr 18, 2025 -Manchester United came from 4-2 down in extra-time to beat Lyon 5-4 in a remarkable Europa League quarter-final to progress 7-6 on aggregate on Thursday.United's season looked over when Lyon came from 2-0 down to lead by two goals with just six minutes remaining at Old Trafford despite having captain Corentin Tolisso sent off.However, a Bruno Fernandes ' penalty, Kobbie Mainoo's strike and Harry Maguire's header capped a stunning finale to set up a semi-final meeting with Athletic Bilbao.""I felt that here everything is possible,"" said United boss Ruben Amorim . ""After the 4-3, the penalty from Bruno, you feel that you can change the game.""The Red Devils sit 14th in the English top flight and defeat would have almost certainly meant missing out on European football entirely next season.Instead they are just three games away from a European trophy and the lifeline of direct access to the riches of the Champions League next season.""Everybody in this moment believes it is possible,"" added Amorim.""One moment can change a lot of things in the players' minds.""United's history is built on dramatic late fightbacks, but few have been more remarkable than this to leave Lyon shellshocked.The home side got off to a flying start thanks to a fine team goal as Fernandes released Alejandro Garnacho down the right and his cross picked out Ugarte to slot in just his second goal since joining the English giants from Paris Saint-Germain.Amorim's decision to restore Andre Onana in goal was under scrutiny.The Cameroonian had been dropped for Sunday's 4-1 thrashing at Newcastle after two costly errors that led to both Lyon's goals in last week's 2-2 first leg draw.Those mistakes came after a war of words with former United midfielder Nemanja Matic, who labelled him ""one of the worst goalkeepers in United's history"".The 29-year-old rewarded his manager's faith with a couple of important stops to prevent Lyon levelling through Paul Akouokou and Rayan Cherki.At the other end, a United side that have often looked laboured and lacking in ideas all season, suddenly clicked into gear in the first 45 minutes.United doubled their lead in first-half stoppage time when Maguire's long ball was expertly controlled by Diogo Dalot, who then fired in off the inside of the post.Garnacho should have killed the tie off within minutes of the restart for the second half when he shot straight at Lucas Perri with Fernandes begging for a pass for a tap in.But the defensive deficiencies and mental fragility of Amorim's side were exposed in a collapse that threatened to cap a miserable campaign.Alexandre Lacazette flicked on Moussa Niakhate's header and Corentin Tolisso swooped to head in and give the visitors a lifeline.Nicolas Tagliafico then prodded in at the back post despite Onana's attempt to scoop it off the line.Just as Lyon were in the ascendency Tolisso gave them a mountain to climb again with a soft second yellow for a trip on Casemiro.Yet, it did not initially matter as Cherki confirmed his status as one of Europe's rising stars with a powerful drive that left Onana motionless.Lyon's other prized asset, Malick Fofana, was then chopped down by Luke Shaw inside the area and Lacazette confidently dispatched the resulting spot-kick.Another penalty at the other end, though, kickstarted the fightback as Fernandes fired home after a VAR review for a foul on Casemiro.Substitute Mainoo showed why he had been thrust in an unfamiliar forward role with a composed finish to level on 120 minutes.Barely 60 seconds later Maguire completed the comeback with a towering header at the back post.""In this moment it is difficult to believe what has just happened,"" said Lyon coach Paulo Fonseca.It is the first time ever in European competition that five goals have been scored in extra-time.",Manchester United came from 4-2 down in extra-time to beat Lyon 5-4 in a remarkable Europa League quarter-final to progress 7-6 on aggregate.

NEW DELHI: Arsenal secured a historic 2-1 victory against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday, advancing to the Champions League semifinals for the first time since 2009 with a 5-1 aggregate score.The match featured crucial VAR interventions in two penalty decisions, with Arsenal maintaining their impressive first-leg advantage of 3-0 from London.Arsenal will now face Paris Saint-Germain in the semifinals, while Inter Milan, who defeated Bayern Munich, will meet Barcelona in the other semifinal matchup.Real Madrid, the defending champion and 15-time European winner, failed to produce one of their trademark comebacks at the Bernabeu, falling short of the last four for the first time since 2020.""There was a lot of talk coming here about (Real Madrid) coming back, because they've done it so many times before, but we had so much belief and confidence from that first game to come here and win the game,"" said Arsenal's Declan Rice, who had scored twice in the first leg through free kicks. ""We knew we were going to suffer, but we knew we were going to win. We had it in our minds and now we've done it in real life.""The match's momentum shifted early when VAR overturned a penalty for Real Madrid following a hold on Kylian Mbappé, after a five-minute review with the score at 0-0.Arsenal had earlier missed their own VAR-awarded penalty when Bukayo Saka failed to convert from the spot.Saka later redeemed himself by scoring in the 65th minute after receiving a pass from Mikel Merino, though Madrid quickly equalized through Vinícius Júnior following a defensive error by William Saliba.Gabriel Martinelli sealed Arsenal's victory with a stoppage-time goal, assisted by Merino.""This is one of the best nights in my football career, for sure,"" Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta said. ""It's a really special one against a team that has been an inspiration for a lot of us in this competition. To win this tie in the manner that we have, we can be very proud.""Mbappé's substitution in the 75th minute due to an apparent injury drew jeers from some Bernabeu supporters, marking another disappointing Champions League campaign for the French star.""It's a tough moment,"" Madrid's Lucas Vazquez said. ""We tried but in the end we couldn't achieve our goal. We'll come back stronger. Madrid always does.""Real Madrid's task was challenging from the outset, facing an Arsenal team that hadn't lost by a three-goal margin in nearly three years. Only four teams in Champions League history had overcome a three-goal first-leg deficit at home.The match began with early drama as Madrid had a goal disallowed after two minutes when Mbappé was caught offside.Arsenal maintained their unbeaten record against Real Madrid, extending it to four matches, including their previous Champions League knockout stage victory in 2005-06.The game featured significant VAR involvement, with Arsenal's penalty awarded after review showed Raúl Asencio holding Mikel Merino during a corner kick.Another VAR review led to the reversal of Madrid's penalty claim after initially being awarded for a hold on Mbappé by Rice.The victory marks Arsenal's return to the Champions League semifinals after a 15-year absence, with their last appearance ending in elimination by Manchester United in 2008-09.",Arsenal defeat Real Madrid 2-1 in Champions League quarterfinals.

Formula E driver Norman Nato is back from Italy after participating in the World Endurance Championship . He took part in the 6 Hours of Imola race, where he finished in tenth position while driving for Hertz Team Jota . After the Sunday race, he penned a note reflecting on his experience in Imola. He also shared a series of candid pictures from the track, including some behind-the-scenes moments — one of which resembled a recent post by F1 driver Alex Albon.Taking to Instagram, Norman Nato posted a few pictures from Italy and wrote a caption summarizing his experience at the 6 Hours of Imola. He wrote: “Difficult weekend in Imola with P10 in race. Still early process with our new team, we keep learning. As always after a difficult one, we gonna analyse and make progress to come back stronger for the next one in Spa @cadillacvseries @jota_sport.”Encouraging him, Cadillac’s official Instagram page commented: “Building and growing,” along with clapping emojis. A person he apparently met in Imola responded to the post: “What a weekend, still enjoyed it a lot! Thanks for taking so much time to chat, greatly appreciate it!”Fans also chimed in with their support: “It'll be much better in Spa, keep pushing,” said one. Another wrote, “Superbe mon Nono,” praising his efforts. One quirky comment read: “Waiting for Norman to play padel with Max & Charles,” along with tennis, racing car and hour glass emojis.In another light-hearted moment on Instagram, Norman shared a selfie taken by one of his teammates on his phone, captioned: “When you leave your phone in the garage while driving.” It echoed a recent post by Formula 1 driver Alex Albon, who had shared selfies taken on his phone after accidentally leaving it behind at a press conference.Also Read: Formula E Drivers Norman Nato and Nyck De Vries compete in FIA World Endurance Championship: Here's how they qualified for 6 Hours of Imola Currently, Norman is recuperating in Andorra, Western Europe.

With five rounds now complete in the 2024–25 Formula E World Championship, there are still 11 races to go before the season concludes in July. In Miami, it was Tag Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein who took the top podium spot.

Rowland had a tough outing in Miami, finishing 10th and earning just one point. But his overall journey this season has been inspiring—starting the Sao Paulo E-Prix in December with zero points, he bounced back impressively. He clinched victory in the Mexico E-Prix (25 points), finished second in Jeddah Part 1 (18 points), and won Jeddah Part 2 (25 points). Thanks to this strong mid-season performance, his lacklustre Miami result hasn’t dented his lead.In second place is Tag Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa with 54 points. He finished runner-up in both the Sao Paulo and Mexico E-Prix races. While his performance dipped in the Jeddah double-header, he recovered well by finishing third in Miami and collecting 15 crucial points.Close behind is his teammate, Pascal Wehrlein, with 51 points. Wehrlein had a disappointing start in Sao Paulo but bounced back with a third-place finish in Mexico. Although his results in Jeddah were average, his win in Miami has significantly boosted his title hopes. A strong showing in Monaco could push him past Da Costa into second place.Also tied at 51 points is the youngest driver on the grid, Taylor Barnard. He impressed with a third-place finish in Sao Paulo and podiums in both Jeddah races—third in Part 1 and second in Part 2.

Miami E-Prix

Formula E drivers Norman Nato and Nyck De Vries are currently in Italy for the second round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC). They participated in the 6 Hours of Imola Qualifying on Saturday, moving a step closer to the main race. Nato finished 9th, while De Vries secured 5th place in the session.Norman Nato, who races for Nissan in the Formula E Championship, represents Cadillac Racing in collaboration with Hertz Team Jota in the Hypercar category of the Endurance Championship. Nyck De Vries, from Mahindra Racing’s Formula E team, finished 5th in the Imola qualifying. He competes for Toyota Gazoo Racing in the WEC, alongside teammate Ryo Hirakawa, who placed 4th in qualifying.Calling it his best effort on track, De Vries told Toyota Europe Newsroom: “As a team, I think we can be fairly satisfied with qualifying fourth and fifth here. We maximised our package, as you can see from the tiny gap between the two cars. I don’t think we could have done much better than that; we did a strong job to execute a clean qualifying. The gap to the front cars looks quite big over one lap, but we will do our best with race pace, tyre management, and strategy to challenge for the podium.”Both drivers are now set to compete in the final race of the 6 Hours of Imola on Sunday, scheduled from 1 PM to 7 PM local time.In their last Formula E outing at the Homestead-Miami Speedway, Nato faced heartbreak after losing what looked like a sure win due to post-race penalties. Although he clinched pole and crossed the line first at the Miami E-Prix, he was relegated to 6th place in the revised results.De Vries had qualified 5th in Miami but ultimately dropped to 11th in the final standings after penalties were applied.Following this, they’ll shift focus to Round 6 of the Formula E World Championship—the highly anticipated Monaco double-header on May 3 and 4.

His last podium came in Season 9, when he was part of Mahindra Racing.The 40-year-old shared his journey to the podium after the win. He said, “It’s very hard to start the project from zero so in the four races, I had four critical problems that pretty much didn’t allow me to finish the race. So I was like, it’s extremely (tough), you need to have a lot of discipline to be able to continue the work and continue to push when you have bad results.”“When you have good results, it’s very easy. But when you have bad results, to go back home, keep the focus, keep the head down and keep doing the work that you do that at one point it’s going to pay off. It’s hard because you work, it doesn’t. Then you work again, it doesn’t pay off again. And then you keep working until it pays off. And today was a day it paid off. So I am very happy.”It was also emotional to see Di Grassi’s wife, Bianca Diniz Caloi, and their young children standing alongside him on the podium as they popped the champagne. Buzzing with confidence, the driver is now aiming to keep the momentum going at the next race in Monaco.

How Nico Mueller secured the top spot

Andretti driver Nico Mueller and his race engineer Bertrand Mermine have surged to the top of the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard following a dramatic Miami Grand Prix, where post-race penalties reshuffled the final standings in Mueller’s favour. Though he originally crossed the line in 10th, Mueller was promoted to 4th, thanks to a well-timed strategy and a dash of late-race chaos. His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace. The season concludes with an award for the top-ranked pairing.After Round 5 in Miami, the leaderboard has Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne and his race engineer Thibault Arnal on number 2. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries and race engineer Tom Bayles are in third position in the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard.The FIA Formula E Instagram account also shared the update, posting:“@nico.mueller51 overtaking his way up the rankings! With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued. Drivers including Norman Nato, Robin Frijns, Oliver Rowland, Sam Bird, and Taylor Barnard were penalized 10 seconds each for misuse of Attack Mode, while Nick Cassidy received a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits.Also Read: Formula E Miami E-Prix 2025: Jake Hughes crashes at chicane, here’s how the multi-car collision changed the outcome.

Yashasvi Jaiswal credits Shubman Gill after maiden Test ton in England: 'I love it'

NEW DELHI: Indian batting legend Sachin Tendulkar stirred nostalgia on Friday with a tweet that connected the current Indian team’s dominant performance at Headingley to one of its most iconic overseas Test wins: the 2002 Headingley Test against England.After centuries from Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal powered India to 359/3 on Day 1 of the 1st Test in Leeds, Tendulkar praised the young duo, along with KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant , for laying a “solid foundation”.The former India captain tweeted, “India’s batting today reminded me of the Headingley Test in 2002, when Rahul (Dravid), @SGanguly99 (Sourav Ganguly) and I scored hundreds in the first innings, and we went on to win the Test.”""Today, Yashasvi and Shubman have done their part. Who will be the third centurion this time?"" he further added.That match, over two decades ago, saw India post 628/8 declared, built on centuries from Rahul Dravid (148), Tendulkar (193), and Sourav Ganguly (128). India went on to win that Test by an innings and 46 runs, marking one of their greatest overseas victories.Now, with Gill (127 not out) and Jaiswal (101) leading the charge in 2025, and Rishabh Pant unbeaten on 65, Tendulkar hinted at déjà vu and asked the question every Indian fan is now wondering: “Who will be the third centurion this time?”Jaiswal, playing his first Test in England, became the first Asian opener to score a Test hundred at Headingley.Gill, captaining India for the first time, led from the front with a classy unbeaten ton. The duo added 129 runs for the third wicket after India lost two early wickets, and were ably supported by Pant, who raised the scoring tempo late in the day.As India look to build a massive first-innings total, the echoes of 2002 are unmistakable, and the stage is set for another memorable Headingley Test.",Sachin Tendulkar says India's batting reminds him of 2002 Headingley Test.

Poll Was India’s dominant batting on Day 1 a sign of their new Test era beginning strong? Yes, the new lineup looks solid No, it’s too early to say

Yashasvi Jaiswal credits Shubman Gill after maiden Test ton in England: 'I love it'

NEW DELHI: Day 1 of the India vs England Test at Headingley was all about Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill ’s brilliance with the bat, but it also included a moment that stirred up fans online, a veiled dig at Virat Kohli by former cricketer and commentator Sanjay Manjrekar While praising KL Rahul and Jaiswal’s shot selection and patience outside the off-stump, Manjrekar made a seemingly innocuous remark that quickly turned viral.“So a lot of what you're seeing is being created by these two batters. And my hat, there's another example of it we know of. A former batter would have gone after that delivery and got himself into trouble, but not these two. And that's why I believe,” he said on-air.Social media users were quick to interpret the comment as a swipe at Virat Kohli, who has often struggled with off-stump discipline in recent years, especially during the India-Australia Tests.Kohli’s tendency to chase deliveries outside off has been a known weakness, and it appears Manjrekar subtly referenced that pattern.The comment comes just weeks after Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket in May, ending a 14-year-long red-ball career that saw him score 9,230 runs in 123 matches, including 27 centuries.Despite his achievements, Kohli's final phase in Tests was marked by a string of dismissals edging to the slips.Meanwhile, on the field, India’s new-look batting order flourished. Gill, in his debut match as Test captain, led from the front with a composed 127 not out and joined legends like Gavaskar and Kohli in scoring a century in his first Test as skipper.Jaiswal’s fluent 101 further solidified India’s dominant position, with the team finishing at a commanding 359/3.Though Kohli may have exited the Test scene, his presence and criticism continues to echo, even subtly, in commentary boxes.

WV Raman backs Shubman Gill to fire in England: 'He needs the right support'

There’s something about June 20 that seems to script destiny in Indian Test cricket.On this very day in 1996, two future legends — Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly began their Test journeys at Lord’s. In 2011, it was Virat Kohli who made his long-awaited Test debut in the West Indies. And now, in 2025, the tradition continues as Sai Sudharsan walks out in whites for the first time, debuting against England at Headingley.The 23-year-old southpaw was handed India’s Test Cap No. 317 on Friday, as Shubman Gill elected to bat first in overcast conditions. With Kohli, Rohit, and Ashwin now retired from the longest format, this marks the beginning of a bold new phase in Indian cricket Sudharsan comes into the match riding a wave of form. He was the Orange Cap winner in IPL 2025, showcasing a temperament and technique that belies his age. Though his first-class average of 39.93 may not leap off the page, his hunger, timing, and ability to adapt have made him a key figure in India’s rebuilding plans.Quiz: Who's that IPL player?

'Wait until August to see what kind of style it’s going to be': Shubman Gill ahead of Headingley Test

Poll Is No. 4 the most crucial position in Test batting? Yes No

Wanderers, 2013: All eyes were on the Indian dressing room as Cheteshwar Pujara and M Vijay were battling it out against Dale Steyn and Co. This was the first Test after Sachin Tendulkar had retired and the talk in the leadup had been all about his replacement at No. 4. Both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli were padded up but when the latter walked in to bat at the fall of Vijay’s wicket, we all knew who would be the new king of Indian cricket This time around, vice-captain Rishabh Pant has poured cold water on all the speculation by announcing that new captain Shubman Gill will be the heir apparent to the recentlyretired Kohli at No. 4. It is clear indication that the team management now considers Gill as their most valuable batter. “Once Virat retired, coach Gambhir and I had a discussion and he wanted me to bat at No. 4, an idea that I endorsed as well,” Gill said in Leeds on Thursday.Tendulkar and Kohli turned No. 4 into a glamour slot with the 13,492 and 7564 runs they scored batting at that position, but both also got oneslot promotions when they first took up the role. Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar , meanwhile, came down from No. 3 to No. 4, just like Gill, when he made that slot his own back in the 1980s.“I was batting at No. 3 before but when Vishy (GR Viswanath) retired, I was asked to come down at No.4. It was slightly easier to bat at No. 4 than No. 3, because by the time I came in to bat, the ball often got slightly older,” Vengsarkar told TOI.It was the Mumbai right-hander’s brilliant run with the bat at No. 4, when he got two centuries and a halfcentury, that helped India win a Test series in England in 1986. “That was one series where I wasn’t always getting the cushion of playing against the older ball. Our top three wasn’t in the best of touch and I was often batting pretty early on. But at the end of the day, it’s a game of confidence,” Vengsarkar said.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? In the second innings of the second Test, when the master right-hander scored a 102 not out to seal the series, he had come out with the score reading 9-2. While Vengsarkar went into that England series having scored runs in that part of the world before, Gill hasn’t had a very good run in England. In the three Tests in England prior to this, the new captain aggregates a paltry 88. He needs to turn that record around pretty fast. The ball swinging in has been a cause of worry for the 25-year-old, and the new skipper has in the past often found his stumps rattled.“The one suggestion I can give Gill is that he should try to get his bat down a little straighter instead of it coming down from gully, like it is right now. The right forearm should touch his waist as he looks to play the ball. That will allow him to play straighter,” Vengsarkar said.The dual job of captaincy and batting at No. 4 is another aspect that the Mumbai man had handled pretty well during his playing days. Gill will have to do the same again in challenging conditions. The fact that there is a bit of inexperience around him may make this slightly difficult. But Vengsarkar believes Gill has the ability to deal with the pressure, given his natural talent.",Shubman Gill will bat at No. 4 for India in the third Test against South Africa.

'Wait until August to see what kind of style it’s going to be': Shubman Gill ahead of Headingley Test

NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill couldn’t have scripted a better beginning to his tenure as India’s Test captain. On Day 1 of the first Test against England at Headingley, the 25-year-old marked his leadership debut in style, slamming a composed and confident hundred to become only the fourth Indian to score a century in his first innings as Test skipper.Live Score: India vs England, 1st Test Day 1 Gill joined the elite list of Vijay Hazare (164* vs England, 1951), Sunil Gavaskar (116 vs New Zealand, 1976), and Virat Kohli (115 vs Australia, 2014), cementing his place in India’s captaincy folklore. He is also the 23rd batter overall in Test history to register a century on captaincy debut.It was his sixth hundred overall and third against England in his 33rd Test matches.Walking in at a delicate juncture after the dismissal of KL Rahul (42), Gill steadied the innings with fellow young gun Yashasvi Jaiswal , forging a vital 129-run partnership. While Jaiswal played with his usual flair en route to a 101, Gill was the picture of poise, blending discipline with elegance as he reached his century in 140 balls, laced with 14 boundaries.He brought up his fastest Test fifty off just 56 balls, highlighting an intent to keep the scoreboard moving. His innings was dotted with trademark drives and confident footwork against both pace and spin. The milestone fifty came with a commanding stroke through covers off Josh Tongue — a fitting symbol of his authority on the day.At 25 years and 285 days, Gill also became the youngest Indian to score a fifty on Test captaincy debut, and only the ninth overall from India to do so.Leading a team in transition after the retirements of stalwarts like Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and R. Ashwin, Gill’s debut knock as captain signals a new chapter for Indian cricket - one built on composure, clarity, and class.Earlier, England captain Ben Stokes won the toss and elected to bowl under clear skies.

NEW DELHI: The much-anticipated five-match Test series between India and England kicks off on Friday, June 20, at Headingley, Leeds.As both teams aim for a strong start in the new World Test Championship cycle, weather conditions might play a pivotal role in the outcome of the opening encounter.Cricket fans hoping for an uninterrupted start to the series will be glad to know that the weather on Day 1 (Friday, June 20) looks promising. The forecast indicates high clouds and warm conditions with a high of 31°C and only a 5% chance of rain. The day is expected to remain mostly clear and mild, ideal for a full day’s play.However, Day 2 (Saturday, June 21) brings a change.

Only four times before have India crossed 300 runs on Day 1 of a tour — Galle (2017), Bloemfontein (2001), Multan (2004) and North Sound (2016). This strong start once again proves how well India’s top order adapts away from home. Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal both scored superb centuries on Day 1. This is only the third time in India’s Test history that two batters have scored hundreds on the very first day of an overseas tour. The last time it happened was in 2017, when Shikhar Dhawan and Cheteshwar Pujara did it in Galle, Sri Lanka. Before that, Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag had done it in Bloemfontein, South Africa in 2001. Rishabh Pant continued to entertain, finishing unbeaten on 65.With this knock, he has now become the highest run-scorer among Asian wicketkeepers in SENA countries (South Africa, England, New Zealand, Australia). His total of 1,732 runs puts him ahead of MS Dhoni, who scored 1,731 runs in these regions. Ben Stokes won the toss and chose to bowl first, hoping to make the most of helpful early conditions. KL Rahul gave India a solid base with 42, and his partner Jaiswal played some fearless shots to notch up his fifth Test century and his first in England.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? There was a small hiccup when Rahul and debutant Sai Sudharsan fell quickly, but Gill and Pant made sure England did not gain any advantage. Gill, leading India as captain for the first time, batted with calm authority to remain unbeaten on 127 at stumps. Pant, known for his attacking style, ended the day with a towering six off Chris Woakes that summed up India’s dominance.With runs on the board and wickets in hand, India are firmly in control. England, missing big names like James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Jofra Archer and Mark Wood, had no answers to the confident stroke-play of India’s young batters.Heading into Day 2, India will look to pile up a huge first-innings score and put England under more pressure as the new World Test Championship cycle begins on an exciting note.","Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal both scored centuries on Day 1. Only the third time in India’s Test history that two batters have scored hundreds on the very first day of an overseas tour. Rishabh Pant continued to entertain, finishing unbeaten on 65.

NEW DELHI: India’s new era in Test cricket began with style, composure, and history on Friday as Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal both scored hundreds on the first day of the opening Test against England at Headingley.India ended a dominant day at 359 for 3, the third-highest first-day score by an Indian team at the start of an overseas tour.It was only the third instance in Indian Test history where two batters scored centuries on Day 1 of an overseas tour. The other two? Tendulkar and Sehwag in Bloemfontein (2001) and Dhawan and Pujara in Galle (2017).Like those iconic starts, this one may come to define a new generation of Indian cricket.Gill, leading India for the first time in Tests, delivered a captain’s knock, a fluent, unbeaten 127. It was his first century outside Asia, achieved under the added pressure of stepping into a side without modern legends like Kohli, Rohit, or Ashwin for the first time in 14 years.Jaiswal, meanwhile, struck a confident 101, becoming the first Asian opener to score a Test hundred at Headingley. His innings, marked by crisp off-side play and a flurry of boundaries, ended right after tea when Ben Stokes finally breached his defenses.Still, the pair’s 176-run stand for the third wicket had already set the tone.England, who had hoped to exploit early conditions after India wanted to bowl first, found little movement and even less discipline. Their pacers leaked runs all day, with captain Stokes (2/43) offering the only control.Rishabh Pant joined Gill late and ended the day with a typically attacking 65*, adding to India’s imposing platform. As far as Day 1 statements go, India couldn’t have asked for a better one to open the five-Test series.","Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal both scored hundreds on the first day of the opening Test against England at Headingley.

Poll What aspect of Gill's batting impressed you the most? His elegant stroke play His composure under pressure

There was a rare outburst of emotion when Shubman Gill 's cover-drive raced through the practice pitches and thudded over the boundary cushions. The helmet was off in a flash; a wild swing of the arm followed as India's new Test skipper celebrated his hundred on his captaincy debut. It wasn't an unusual sight, and it certainly was an unusual occasion, so much so that it nearly made the youngster skip his usual bow-down celebration.The hug with his deputy Rishabh Pant was probably the cue to pose for the photographers as the 25-year-old made a very strong statement by scoring a gorgeous hundred at the Headingley Cricket Ground. From the moment he came out to bat, there was a sense of urgency in his approach. That urgency could have cost him his wicket when he went for a tight single off his sixth ball but had the rub of the green on his side, and Ollie Pope missing the stumps gave him an early reprieve.A testing little period followed as England attacked the right-hander's stumps and probed the corridor just outside the off-stump, but a tight approach and very little help from the surface meant he survived and then cashed in on the fuller length. The hosts kept searching for the glory ball when he walked out to bat, but even the change in length didn't extract a lot of purchase from the surface and turned out to be easy pickings for the Indian skipper, who put on a masterclass.A gorgeous masterclass.The cover drives, straight drives, flicks, controlled pulls, and the trademark cuts in front of square were a treat to watch as he grew in confidence with every shot and looked much tighter as the innings progressed. After the initial urgency, there was a lot of calm in the way he approached the innings and put his head down to lay the foundation for a big one.First with Yashasvi Jaiswal and then with Rishabh Pant, Gill eased into his new No. 4 role and drove the side forward during a very crucial passage of play, as the match was very delicately poised when he came out to bat at the fall of debutant Sai Sudharsan's wicket. The sun had suddenly disappeared, and another wicket could have put India on the mat even after a terrific opening stand between KL Rahul and Jaiswal.Gill ensured there was no serious damage and literally walked the pre-match talk where he asserted that he wants to be the best batter in the series. Still early days in what is a very long series, but the Day 1 knock could have easily won a beauty pageant for the most good-looking hundred. There is something about Gill when he is in full flow, as not only does he make shot-making look ridiculously easy, he manages to be a visual delight while doing that.For Gill, the batter, who has been repeatedly questioned for his outings away from home, the hundred in Leeds will give the youngster immense satisfaction and a lot of self-belief before Gill - the captain - takes over.",Shubman Gill scored a gorgeous hundred on his captaincy debut.

How Shubman Gill prepared for the first Test vs England in Leeds | Exclusive from Nets

'Wait until August to see what kind of style it’s going to be': Shubman Gill ahead of Headingley Test

A comfortable single to reach the three-figure mark, the arms went up and the helmet came off before the leap of faith.Punches in the air followed as Yashasvi Jaiswal celebrated the hundred in his maiden Test innings on English soil . There was relief, there was happiness and for those few moments, the pain disappeared as he celebrated with his captain Shubman Gill Not long before reaching the milestone, the left-hander received multiple treatments on his right forearm, potentially because of cramps and looked in severe pain while navigating the 90s.Except it wasn't 'nervous' 90s by any stretch. Physical ailments, visit by the physio was followed by twin boundaries and confident punch to bring up the ton.The forearm, however, was the only thing which slightly troubled him during his first taste of Test cricket in England as the hosts' bowlers found it tough to keep the opener quiet on the opening day of the Leeds Test.The pitch was on the flatter side, the outfield was lightning quick and the left-hander played with a lot of application to first see off the new Duke, and then capitaised whenever width was on offer.Though, 'capitalise' isn't probably the right word to use as he was lethal whenever the bowlers gave him room. The slashes and the cuts didn't stop, and even Ben Stokes ' out-of-the-box field placements - leg-gully, two men in catching position for the cut/slash, a deep third and deep fine for the ramp - didn't affect the way he operated.There was a lot of clarity and a similar dose of audacity in how he went about doing business on the opening day of the long summer. The scoring pattern validated his means and ways as 70 out of his 100 runs came in boundaries - 16 fours and a six.England's desperation to try too many things in little time further helped his cause as there were a lot of boundary balls on offer, and Stokes' fielding placements made the job easier. Off-side remained his dominant scoring area as only nine out of his first hundred runs were scored towards the leg-side. The hundred runs which made him only the first Indian, and fifth overall, to score a century in their first Tests in England and Australia.If the century in Perth was an announcement of his arrival away from home, the Headingley knock was a reminder of his class against an opposition he has enjoyed a lot of success against. When he gets in, he makes the opposition pay and his four hundreds - 161, 214*, 209 and 171 - in the format and more in the First-Class circuit have been big, and rarely has he thrown his wicket after getting his eye in.Even with the pain in the forearm and without the elbowguard - which he had to let go off when in the 90s - there was very little doubt this knock will not follow the Jaiswal template.The eye was set, pitch wasn't doing any tricks and the opposition was clearly running short on ideas to keep the southpaw quiet. A moment of brilliance was the need of the hour and it was Stokes who took matters in his own hands.A 52.2 overs old delivery in his hand, the England captain, from around the wicket, used the angle and away movement off the pitch to his advantage and hit the top of off-stump to send the centurion back to the hut. Jaiswal dragged himself out of the park to a rapturous applause from the capacity crowd and was greeted by a warm hug from Rishabh Pant near the ropes before the wicketkeeper-batter went out to bat.On the opening day, Jaiswal stamped authority, class, and even with a troubled forearm, he managed to throw the right punches to keep the opposition in the far corner for the majority of the day.",Yashasvi Jaiswal scored 100 in his first Test innings on English soil.

Debut disappointment for Sai Sudharsan

Yashasvi Jaiswal continues dream run





Captain Gill matches Kohli’s feat with commanding century

Pant adds spark, India finish Day 1 at 359/3

A new era of Indian Test cricket began with poise and purpose on Friday as Shubman Gill’s India stamped their authority on the opening day of the first Test against England at Headingley in the Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy.Sent in to bat after England captain Ben Stokes won the toss, India overcame early challenges to finish the day at a commanding 359/3 - their highest-ever Day 1 total in a Test in England.Scaorecard: India vs England, 1st Test Day 1 Skipper Gill led from the front with an unbeaten 127, becoming only the fourth Indian to score a century in his maiden innings as Test captain, emulating legends like Vijay Hazare, Sunil Gavaskar, and Virat Kohli. Yashasvi Jaiswal’s sublime 101 and a composed unbeaten 65 from vice-captain Rishabh Pant added to India’s dominance. Their combined efforts have put India firmly in control, making a bold statement in their first Test since the retirements of stalwarts Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and R Ashwin.Much was expected from debutant Sai Sudharsan, but the 23-year-old endured a harsh introduction to Test cricket. Handed cap No. 317 by Cheteshwar Pujara, Sudharsan came in at No. 3 but was dismissed for a duck after just four balls — becoming the first Indian debutant since 2011 to suffer such a fate.His nervous stay ended when Ben Stokes, attacking with discipline, found the edge through to the keeper.The early dismissal slightly dented India’s promising 91-run opening stand between KL Rahul (42) and Yashasvi Jaiswal. India went into lunch at 92/2, with questions looming about their new-look middle order.Yashasvi Jaiswal once again proved why he is India’s most exciting red-ball batting prospect. The 23-year-old left-hander struck his fifth Test century — and third against England — to continue his remarkable trend of scoring hundreds in the opening Test of every overseas series he's played.Jaiswal's 101 off 159 balls featured 16 fours and a six. His innings was a fine blend of restraint and aggression, beginning with a fluent drive off Woakes and building into a commanding knock that blunted England’s bowling attack. Notably, he added 129 runs with Gill for the third wicket, a partnership that pulled India away from early trouble and toward a position of dominance.In his first outing as Test captain, Shubman Gill showed exactly why he's been trusted to lead India into a new era. Calm under pressure, the 25-year-old constructed a majestic innings, reaching his sixth Test century and his third against England.His unbeaten 127 off 175 balls was a masterclass in timing, intent, and authority. He reached his fifty off just 56 balls — his fastest in Tests — and didn’t let up. With 14 crisp boundaries, Gill joined Hazare, Gavaskar, and Kohli as the only Indians to score a century in their first innings as Test captain.At 25 years and 285 days, he also became the youngest Indian skipper to record a fifty on captaincy debut. His composure, combined with tactical clarity, suggests India’s transition may be in safe hands.R ishabh Pant added the late flourish, accelerating after Jaiswal’s dismissal to notch up a confident 65* off 102 balls. The Gill-Pant stand remains unbroken at stumps, already worth 138 runs for the fourth wicket.England’s bowlers, barring Ben Stokes (2/43), struggled to extract much from the surface. Brydon Carse took the only other wicket, while the rest of the attack looked toothless against India’s batting discipline.India’s 359/3 is their highest Day 1 total in England, surpassing the 338/7 scored at Edgbaston in 2022. It’s also the highest Day 1 score by any visiting team in England since 2003, when South Africa posted 362/4 at The Oval.","Shubman Gill becomes fourth Indian to score a century in his maiden innings as Test captain, emulating legends like Vijay Hazare, Sunil Gavaskar, and Virat Kohli.

Liverpool’s biggest-ever transfer! Florian Wirtz joins Premier League club from Bayer Leverkusen in stunning record deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/liverpools-biggest-ever-transfer-florian-wirtz-joins-premier-league-club-from-bayer-leverkusen-in-stunning-record-deal/articleshow/121985525.cms,"Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz (AP Photo)

Florian Wirtz has joined Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen for a club-record fee, following the Reds' 20th English top-flight title victory under Arne Slot. Former Liverpool midfielder and Wirtz's ex-coach Xabi Alonso has already recognised him as one of the world's best players.British media has reported that Liverpool will pay up to £116 million ($157 million) for the attacking midfielder. German sources suggest an even higher fee, beginning at 130 million euros (£111 million, $149 million) with potential add-ons reaching 150 million euros.A dispute arose between Cologne and Leverkusen five years ago when Leverkusen signed the teenage Wirtz at age 17. Cologne claimed a gentleman's agreement regarding youth players was broken, but Leverkusen maintained Wirtz was a first-team signing.Wirtz's progress was halted by a cruciate knee ligament injury in March 2022, keeping him sidelined for 10 months. Upon his return, he found Alonso as the new Leverkusen manager, leading to the club's most successful period.Under their partnership, Leverkusen ended Bayern Munich's Bundesliga dominance, securing both the league title and German Cup without losing a match in 2023/24. Wirtz celebrated the title-clinching match against Werder Bremen with his first career hat-trick, later earning the Bundesliga player of the year award.""Flo is one of the top players in the world, he's world class,"" said Real Madrid coach Alonso, who compared his protégé to Lionel Messi in terms of his understanding of the game.""Why is Messi so good? Because he knows how and when to play simple passes. Messi says: 'You're in a better position? Here, there you have the ball'. It's not always about making the most brilliant move, but the best and smartest. Florian can do that. That's why he's so good.""Both Wirtz and Alonso initially committed to staying at Leverkusen for another year. However, their Europa League final loss to Atalanta in 2023/24 marked a turning point.Bayern Munich regained control of German football the following season but failed to convince Wirtz to join them. Instead, he chose to move to the Premier League champions.""I'm really excited to have a new adventure in front of me. This was also a big point of my thoughts: that I want to have something completely new, to go out of the Bundesliga and to join the Premier League,"" said Wirtz. ""I spoke also with some players who played there and they told me that it's perfect for me and every pitch is perfect, you can enjoy every game. I'm really looking forward to playing my first game.""Despite his impressive record of 57 goals and 65 assists in 197 games for Leverkusen, Wirtz will start his Liverpool career alongside Mohamed Salah. Liverpool sees Wirtz's creative abilities as key to maintaining Salah's scoring record and supporting the team's attack.The club might sell their previous record signing, Darwin Nunez, who cost £85 million but hasn't met expectations, to offset some of their recent spending. Liverpool aims for Wirtz to adapt to the Premier League's physical demands and help maintain their success under Slot's management.",Florian Wirtz has joined Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen for a club-record fee.

Dutch soccer player Quincy Promes was being extradited Friday from Dubai to the Netherlands, where he faces a prison sentence for involvement in cocaine smuggling, the prosecutor's office told The Associated Press.The Dutch public prosecution service confirmed to the AP that Promes was en route to the Netherlands, in Dutch custody. Promes, who scored seven goals in 50 international matches for the Netherlands before legal issues derailed his international career, was convicted last year of complicity in cocaine smuggling and sentenced in his absence to six years in prison.Amsterdam District Court ruled that Promes was involved in the import and export of hundreds of kilograms (pounds) of cocaine in 2020. His lawyers told judges he denied the allegations. In 2023, Promes was found guilty of stabbing his cousin in the leg and was sentenced to 18 months in prison.Both of Promes' convictions are currently under appeal. Promes, a 33-year-old former player for Ajax and Sevilla, had been playing for Spartak Moscow and living in Russia from 2021 until last year, when he was reportedly arrested in Dubai around the time that Spartak was there for friendly games. More recently, he had been playing with United FC, a second-tier club in Dubai.","Quincy Promes was being extradited Friday from Dubai to the Netherlands.

Real Madrid superstar Kylian Mbappe has been hospitalized in the United States due to an acute case of gastroenteritis, the club confirmed on Thursday. The French forward missed Real Madrid’s Club World Cup opener against Al-Hilal, which ended in a 1-1 draw, marking Xabi Alonso’s first match as head coach.“Our player Kylian Mbappe is suffering from an acute case of gastroenteritis and has been admitted to hospital in order to undergo a series of tests and follow the appropriate course of treatment,” Real Madrid said in an official statement.Mbappe, 26, had been feeling unwell in the days leading up to the match in Miami, with Alonso noting earlier that the striker was ""feeling a little better"" but still not fully fit. He also missed training on Tuesday with a fever and in his absence during the game on Wednesday, 21-year-old Madrid B-team player Gonzalo Garcia started and scored the opening goal against the Saudi Arabian side.Real Madrid’s next fixture in Group H is scheduled for Sunday, June 22, against Mexican club Pachuca in Charlotte.

A visit to the White House by Juventus players took an unexpected turn when US President Donald Trump posed a surprising question about transgender athletes. The Juventus squad, in the United States to compete in the Club World Cup, found themselves in an awkward moment during the meeting.After commending Juventus as a “great team,” Trump suddenly asked, “Could a woman make your team, fellas?” According to The Guardian, the Juventus players responded with nervous smiles but remained silent. Video footage of the exchange shows the players exchanging confused glances, clearly caught off guard by the question. FIFA President Gianni Infantino was also present during the interaction.Trump repeated the question, prompting Juventus’s general manager Damien Comolli to step in with a diplomatic response: “We have a very good women’s team,” referring to Juventus Women, the current Serie A champions. Trump quickly countered, “But they should be playing with women,” leaving Comolli without a reply. The US President then remarked, “See they are being very diplomatic,” before the meeting concluded with the team presenting Trump a Juventus club shirt.This incident comes in the wake of an executive order signed by Trump in February that barred transgender athletes from participating in women’s sports. The order, criticized by human rights advocates as discriminatory, not only set regulations but also instructed the US Department of Education to investigate schools suspected of non-compliance.Following the awkward encounter, Juventus showed their strength on the field later that day, securing a commanding 5-0 victory over Al Ain from the United Arab Emirates at Washington DC’s Audi Field.",US President Donald Trump asked Juventus players if a woman could make their team.

The humidity is not easy. We had good moments, many new players. The first game in this group stage is always really, really important.

How Formula E is making an impact in Jakarta

Formula E is not only introducing the fastest electric car, the GEN3 Evo, at the Jakarta E-Prix this year but also making an impact off the track. Several Formula E members participated in a beach clean-up on Thursday at Pantai Beach in the Ancol resort, where the race will be held. They are also engaging in local partnerships, educational initiatives, and community outreach to help reduce the environmental impact in the city.On Thursday, June 19, Formula E, Waste4Change, and over 100 volunteers—including FE team members and drivers—joined local community members for a large-scale beach clean-up. The initiative focused on conserving marine habitats and addressing waste management, a key issue in coastal Jakarta.Julia Pallé, VP of Sustainability at Formula E, said about the drive: “Plastic pollution is a growing problem that affects everyone around the world and is a growing challenge here in Jakarta — threatening both coastal habitats and the health of nearby communities. At every race, we are committed to engaging with local communities and aim to leave a place better than we found it. We are united as a championship with the community to clean the local area of plastic rubbish and ensure it is sustainably managed and not put back into landfill.To further minimize waste at the event, free hydration stations will provide water refills to reduce reliance on single-use plastic bottles. Visitors will also receive biodegradable eco-cups made from corn starch flour as an alternative to traditional plastic. Six dedicated waste stations will be set up for proper recycling and plastic waste management.Formula E has undertaken several more sustainability initiatives in Jakarta. A Formula E delegation visited the Waste4Change recycling center on Tuesday to learn about effective waste management practices and the role of the circular economy in conserving resources.On Wednesday, a school visit featured a panel talk on environmental education and youth leadership, along with art and cultural exchanges between students and Formula E members.Following the race, a paddock plant donation is scheduled. Trees and plants used during the event will be donated to local schools. After the race on Saturday, Formula E will host a ceremony on-site with local school students to mark the donation.Also Read: Jakarta E-Prix 2025: Schedule, how to watch Round 12 Formula E race, weather prediction In addition, Formula E’s Better Futures Fund is providing a €25,000 donation to Yayasan Perempuan dan Anak Amirah.

Jakarta E‑Prix Essentials: Everything You Need to Know | Formula E Season 11, Round 12

Season 11 of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship is coming to a close, with five races remaining on the calendar. The Jakarta E-Prix is a crucial race, and it's hard to predict who may lift the trophy in Indonesia this year. The current season has already seen seven different race winners and fifteen drivers on the podium. Not only that, but every single team has achieved a podium finish so far — a clear indication of how tight and unpredictable the competition is.Nissan's Oliver Rowland is far ahead of the competition so far, as he dominates the FIA Drivers' World Championship standings with 171 points — significantly ahead of Pascal Wehrlein, who sits in second position with 103 points for TAG Heuer Porsche. Rowland has a total of four wins and three second-place finishes this season, and he may continue his winning streak in Jakarta as well.Maserati MSG Racing’s Maximilian Gunther is being counted among the hot favourites to bag a podium at the Jakarta E-Prix. He has two wins under his belt this year and will be trying his best to maintain his stronghold in the city and add more points to his tally.He had secured third place in the Part 1 race in 2023, having started from Julius Bar Pole Position — a historic moment as Maserati's first single-seater motorsport pole since 1958.He again bagged the pole the next day of the double-header and went on to win his first race in the iconic blue livery of Maserati MSG Racing. It marked Maserati’s first single-seater championship podium since Juan Manuel Fangio's 1957 German Grand Prix victory, en route to that year’s Formula One title.Pascal Wehrlein won one of the two races at the Jakarta E-Prix’s last edition, and the TAG Heuer Porsche driver is very much in form at present, with a win in Miami and three more podium finishes in the Formula E 2025 World Championship so far. He is second in the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings with 103 points and will be aiming for a win to catch up with Rowland.Jaguar TCS Racing’s Mitch Evans has been away from the podium for a long time now after winning the first race of this season in Sao Paulo. But this could also indicate his growing hunger for a win — or at least another podium — possibly in Jakarta, before the season comes to a close. Evans had won the first edition of the Jakarta E-Prix in 2022, when three drivers crossed the line within a single second. The other two drivers were Jean-Éric Vergne and Edoardo Mortara, who took second and third positions in that Season 8 race.He also bagged the third spot on the podium in Race 2 of the Jakarta double-header in 2023. This makes him one of the strong contenders to make a comeback on the podium.Also Read: Jakarta E-Prix 2025: Schedule, how to watch Round 12 Formula E race, weather prediction Since Nick Cassidy and Sebastien Buemi have also ended their race droughts this year, one can expect a new winner in Jakarta as well. The E-Prix begins on Friday with the free practice session and will conclude on Saturday with the final race in the early evening.

All about the Jakarta International E-Prix Circuit in Ancol



Inside Jakarta’s Street Circuit | Formula E Season 11 Round 12

As the Formula E season reaches Round 12, the drivers are set to head to Indonesia for the Jakarta E-Prix. The single-header will be held at the picturesque Ancol Beach street track in Jakarta on June 21. The venue is Southeast Asia’s largest park, which sees around 40,000 visitors a day. The race marks the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship’s return to Jakarta after Season 9. Here’s all about the track that will host the Gen3 Evo race for the first time.The design of the 2.37 km Ancol Beach track is inspired by the Kuda Lumping—a flat horse woven from bamboo and decorated with colourfully painted cloth, which a dancer rides for the traditional Javanese dance. The dancers appear to enter a trance-like state during the dance, which requires a lot of physical power.The track features unique banked sections, undulations, bumps, and a mix of technical and high-speed zones, all expected to test the skill of the Formula E drivers. The 18-turn circuit kicks off with a tight opening sector after a long run down the start/finish straight. There is plenty of room for manoeuvre into the right-hander at Turn 1 before drivers head into a flowing series of turns that swoop by Ancol Beach City.The final sector is a tricky complex following a fast right-hander at Turn 12 and another long straight into what will be a busy Turn 13 hairpin. An awkward left-hander at Turn 18 rounds out the lap, with a strong slingshot required down the long home straight.The circuit also aims to help revive tourism in the island nation, which was significantly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The last Jakarta E-Prix was held in Season 9 (2023–24), marking the second race after the inaugural edition in 2022. This will be the third time theFormula E race is held in Jakarta.Also Read: Oliver Rowland opens up about Shanghai E-Prix, gears up for Jakarta race Last year, Maserati MSG Racing driver Maximilian Günther and Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein won each of the two races held during the Jakarta double-header.

Formula E driver Jake Dennis celebrated his 30th birthday in style by throwing a yacht party with friends and family. The Andretti driver has been sharing several glimpses of his wild celebration aboard the luxurious yacht. On the occasion, his teammate Nico Mueller wrote him a birthday card — and it’s his race-themed message that stood out among everything that happened around Dennis' birthday.A video shared on Andretti’s Instagram page shows Jake Dennis reading out the birthday message penned by his Andretti teammate Nico Mueller. The card read: “Around lap around the sun and you are still somehow managing to stay in attack mode. Though at your age, it might just be the sugar rush from the birthday cake. I’d say you are aging like a good race strategy, unexpected, a bit chaotic, but somehow still working out in the end. But if you get any older, we might need to swap your visor for reading glasses.”“Hope your day is full of pole position vibes, clean lines and zero penalty points for once. Don’t worry if things start going down this year, just blame the software update. If it works for the car, it should work for you too. It’s a pleasure sharing the garage with you even if your setup notes are questionable.Enjoy the ride mate and don’t forget to lift and coast through your thirties,” it further read.Meanwhile, Dennis seemed to have had the wildest birthday party ever. He shared multiple videos and pictures on his Instagram Stories from the yacht party even before the birthday began. He was seen walking like a king — in a robe over an unbuttoned shirt and shorts — along with girls dressed as the king’s attendants. It seems his family and friends had a great time celebrating his birthday on the yacht with food, drinks, a jacuzzi, and more.Also Read: Monaco E-Prix Round 6: Oliver Rowland wins, Nyck de Vries second, Jake Dennis secures third spot on podium despite penalty Jake Dennis is currently in ninth position in the Formula E Driver Standings with one podium and 56 points.

Standing alongside his teammates, team principal, and technical staff at the Shanghai International Circuit, he broke into a spirited rendition of Taylor Swift’s Love Story.FIA Formula E’s official Instagram handle posted a heartwarming video of Cassidy’s unique celebration, captioning it: ""Our favourite Love Story is @jaguarracing and this podium. Celebrating Cassidy’s P1 performance in their traditional team style. @Hankooktire.Motorsports #ShanghaiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing""Cassidy sang these lyrics with infectious energy, amplifying the already electric post-race atmosphere: ""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run. You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.

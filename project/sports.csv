India emerged victorious in the two-day pink-ball warm-up game ahead of the second day-night Test in Adelaide, set to begin on December 6.A video circulating on social media captured Rohit playfully tapping Gill, sparking laughter between the two.Following the win over the Prime Minister's XI, Rohit expressed satisfaction with the team's performance, highlighting that they met their objectives as a unit.Pacer Harshit Rana's four-wicket haul, coupled with stellar performances from Gill, Nitish Kumar Reddy, and Yashasvi Jaiswal , powered India to victory at Canberra's Manuka Oval on Sunday.During the post-match presentation, Rohit also thanked the crowd for their unwavering support.""It was fantastic (the match and the win). We got what we wanted as a group. It was a bit unfortunate that we couldn't play the entire game, but we made the most of the time we had. Absolutely fantastic (to see the crowd). We love coming to Australia, and it's always great to see fans turn up to support us. There's never been a time when they haven't shown up.

India skipper Rohit bats at No. 4 in pink-ball warm-up, possibly heeding call of the hour for

Adelaide Test

Who could replace Rohit Sharma as Team India's captain in Tests?

As India were getting ready to go out to bat against the Prime Minister's XI in Canberra on Sunday, all eyes were on the openers. Would it be Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul , makeshift duo which brilliantly settled in Perth, or would it be the returning captain, Rohit Sharma Rohit's recent struggle at the top of the order has been well-documented - he managed only 91 in the six innings that he played against New Zealand in India less than a month ago. More importantly, four of those dismissals came against pacers facing the new ball on spin-friendly surfaces.Rahul, on the other hand, had beautifully blunted the new ball in Perth and cricket fans were keen to see whether the captain, who is known to be extremely flexible for the team's cause, would be ready to demote himself.Rohit did just that and if this is anything to go by, we may well see Rohit 3.0 - back at the middle-order for the pink-ball Test in Adelaide starting Friday.With Shubman Gill returning fit from his finger injury and batting beautifully for 50 before retiring out, it appears the top 4 for India in Adelaide will be Rahul, Jaiswal, Gill andOn Sunday though, after Rahul retired out for 27, Rohit came in at No. 4. He looked rusty, lasted just 11 balls before nicking one to the 'keeper off medium-pacer Charlie Anderson. It didn't stop India from winning easily by five wickets, but it was obvious that the captain still needed some time in the middle.But the decision to demote himself - if he does for Adelaide, that is -at this stage of his career will be a big move, considering that most of his success with the bat has come as opener.Rohit started his Test career in Kolkata as a No. 6 against West Indies and scored a sparkling 177 on debut. But over the years, he lost his way in the middle-order, and according to himself, when the offer to open in Tests came in 2019, he knew it would be his last chance.""When I was asked to open in 2019 (in Vizag against South Africa), I knew this would be my last chance to resurrect my Test career,"" Rohit had later said after scoring a century.As an opener, with nine centuries in 37 Tests at an average of 44.01, it does look significantly better than his returns in the middle-order, where he averages 39.02. That said, this season he has truly struggled against the moving ball and his ability to leave a lot of deliveries outside the offstump - something that stood him in good stead in England - seems to have taken a beating.Rahul, on the other hand, has looked assured at the top of the order - even on Sunday, the way he handled the new pink ball was quite a treat.Devang Gandhi, a former India opener and a national selector, feels Rohit should stick to the middle-order, because that will avoid ""unnecessary chopping and changing"" in the light of the brilliant start to the tour. ""In fact, I feel Rohit should come in at No. 6, because Rishabh Pant , too, has shaped up very well at 5…The left-right combo, too, can be maintained that way,"" Gandhi told TOI.But it would require an adjustment when a player is asked to change his batting position at the fag-end of his career?""It becomes difficult if a middle-order batter tries to become an opener in the latter stages of his career. But it will not be difficult for an opener to go in the middle-order, especially for Rohit, who started as a No. 6 batter for India,"" Gandhi said.If Rohit has to look for a positive example, he may find one in Sunil Gavaskar , opener supreme, whose top score of 236 not out against the West Indies came as a No. 4 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in 1983.But then Rohit and the Indian team management don't take calls on basis of past records. They live in the present and it presently seems that the call of the hour is for the captain to don the middle-order batter's hat in what will probably be his final journey as a Test batter.","India skipper Rohit bats at No. 4 in pink-ball warm-up, possibly heeding call of the hour for Adelaide Test.

IPL Auction: KKR break bank for potential captain Venkatesh Iyer?

MUMBAI: In a remarkable turn in his T20 cricket career, Mumbai's Ranji Trophy captain Ajinkya Rahane has emerged as a leading contender to captain the Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL 2025 , TOI has learnt.At the IPL auction in Jeddah a few days back, KKR had bought the 36-year-old at his base price of Rs 1.5 crore.""Yes, at the moment it's 90% confirmed that Ajinkya will be the new KKR captain. He was bought by KKR specifically for the purpose of being a viable captaincy option,"" a source told TOI.This development is indeed a surprise because the Shah Rukh Khan-owned franchise were tipped to appoint allrounder Venkatesh Iyer as the captain after buying him for a staggering Rs 23.75 crore at the IPL auction recently.If the 36-year-old becomes the captain, it will be a huge turnaround in the fortunes of Rahane, who was recently removed as the Mumbai captain for the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy.The Mumbai Cricket Association preferred the in-form Shreyas Iyer for the job instead.Ironically, if Rahane gets the job, he will replace Iyer, who had captained KKR to the IPL title last season.While Rahane is no longer a part of the Indian team in any format, his captaincy credentials are next to none in Indian cricket.","Mumbai's Ranji Trophy captain Ajinkya Rahane has emerged as a leading contender to captain the Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL 2025.

NEW DELHI: Former India batting legend Sunil Gavaskar is of the opinion that India will make at least two changes for the day-night Adelaide Test against Australia that starts from December 6.After the stupendous victory in the first Test against Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , India is scheduled to play a two-day warm-up match against Prime Ministers XI at the Manuka Oval in the Australian capital of Canberra from Saturday.The pink ball warm-up match in Canberra is of utmost importance for India as it will be the only practice game they will get to play ahead of the day-night second Test in Adelaide.And it will be also the first game for captain Rohit Sharma on this trip to Australia as he missed the first Test in Perth due to the birth of his son.Talking to 7Cricket, Gavaskar said, ""I think there will be two changes for sure, both Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill coming back into the 11.""Young Devdutt Padikkal is set to be replaced by returning captain Rohit Sharma in the Indian playing XI for the second Test in Adelaide.Everyone will be intrigued by KL Rahul 's batting position in the pink ball warm-up match in Canberra.Rahul might be positioned at number three instead of Padikkal, depending on whether the injured Gill recovers in time for the game.Gill missed the first Test match and has not yet begun batting in the nets after suffering a hairline fracture during the intra-squad match at the WACA.Gavaskar continues, ""My feeling is that the batting order will change. Where Rohit Sharma will replace Rahul, Shubman Gill will bat at three, Padikkal and Jurel will go out of the team, Rahul will bat at six.""At the Adelaide Oval, spin bowling might be the only tactical change made to the starting lineup.In Perth, Washington Sundar was selected ahead of the two veteran spinners, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja.Before the 36-all-out occurred in the December 2020 Pink Ball Test in Adelaide, Ashwin handed India the lead in the first innings with statistics of 4 for 45, including a brilliant dismissal of Steven Smith.However, based on their recent performance in the nets, Ashwin, Jadeja, and Washington don't now provide much of a choice. Additionally, batting becomes crucial in Pink Ball Tests because the spinners aren't used as often.Gavaskar concludes, ""And one other change that could happen is that Jadeja comes in place of Washington Sundar.""India's success in overseas Test matches has been mostly attributed to Jadeja's batting, although Washington, a left-hander, has also performed admirably in Test matches. In Perth, he helped India surpass the 500-run mark with an 89-run partnership with Virat Kohli",Sunil Gavaskar believes India will make at least two changes for Adelaide Test. India will play a two-day warm-up match against Prime Ministers XI in Canberra.

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant shattered records at the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 mega auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, becoming the highest-paid player in the league's history. The Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) secured the dynamic wicketkeeper-batter for an unprecedented Rs 27 crore.Pant's previous franchise Delhi Capitals attempted to retain their star player by exercising the Right to Match (RTM) card at Rs 20.75 crore. However, LSG’s aggressive bid of Rs 27 crore forced Delhi Capitals to step back, sealing Pant’s move to the Lucknow-based franchise.Pant’s record-breaking contract caps off a remarkable comeback story. After surviving a near-fatal car accident in 2022 and undergoing extensive rehabilitation, he returned to international cricket with a renewed focus for the 2024 season of the IPL.Now, Pant is expected to lead LSG as captain in the upcoming IPL 2025 season, which is scheduled to begin on March 14.While Rs 27 crore headlines Pant’s historic contract, the actual net payout will be a different story due to tax implications.Lucknow have committed Rs 27 crore per season for Pant's services with the team. The Indian government will claim Rs 8.1 crore in tax (30%) from his total contract value. This leaves Pant with a net salary of Rs 18.9 crore per season from his IPL team.Speaking about Rishabh Pant's move to LSG, former India player Robin Uthappa opined, “I think the fact that Shreyas was bid for by Punjab Kings was a planned thing, because even if they didn’t go for him, because they had the luxury of having such a big bank, they could have gotten Pant for a little less. I think there was communication where Rishabh really wanted to move on from everything that was DC in the past and go on to other things in life and I think that is why there was less interest from Ponting and Punjab Kings for Pant and more interest in Shreyas.”Another ex-India player, Mohammad Kaif, said, ""With Rishabh Pant joining LSG, the team has gained both a strong brand value and a recognisable face—an essential factor for any franchise. While LSG do not have many big names apart from Pooran, Pant’s presence will significantly benefit them. The decision to jump from ₹21 crore to ₹27 crore was aggressive, but it’s a move that seems justified. They now have an Indian captain, and securing Rishabh Pant at ₹27 crore is a worthwhile deal for LSG.""Rs 27 crore (per season)Rs 8.1 crore (as per Indian government regulations)Rs 18.9 crore (per season).","Rishabh Pant becomes most expensive IPL player after he goes to LSG for Rs 27 crore.

NEW DELHI: Joe Root , one of England's greatest-ever cricketers, marked a significant milestone by becoming the fourth English player and the 11th in the world to play 150 Test matches. The first Test against New Zealand in Christchurch was expected to be a celebration of Root's illustrious career, but it turned into an anticlimactic occasion as the premier batter was dismissed for a duck in the first innings.The 33-year-old Root, who had entered the match with a staggering 12,754 Test runs at an average of 51.01, was bowled by New Zealand medium-pacer Nathan Smith . Attempting to punch the ball through the covers, Root got an inside edge that brushed his back thigh before deflecting onto the stumps.The dismissal placed Root in an unfortunate club, as he became only the third batter to be out for a duck in their 150th Test. He joined Australian legends Steve Waugh , who suffered the fate against Pakistan in Sharjah in 2002, and Ricky Ponting , who was dismissed for zero against England in Adelaide in 2010.Despite the disappointment in Christchurch, Root’s recent form has been nothing short of spectacular. He has amassed 1,338 runs this year alone at an average of 55.75, including five centuries and four fifties. With 35 Test centuries in his career, Root continues to be a pivotal figure for England, although Friday's duck was the 13th in his 12-year Test career.Root's achievement of reaching 150 Tests underscores his longevity and consistency at the highest level of the game.

Prithvi Shaw, base price Rs 75 lakh, failed to attract a bid at IPL 2025 mega auction

NEW DELHI: Prithvi Shaw , once regarded as one of India's brightest cricketing talents, found no takers at the IPL 2025 mega auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The 25-year-old batter, who captained India to victory at the 2018 U19 World Cup, had entered the auction with a conservative base price of Rs 75 lakh but remained unsold.Shaw, who was released by Delhi Capitals after a six-year stint, had been a mainstay in the franchise since 2018. However, inconsistent performances and questions over his fitness have deterred franchises from bidding for him.Delhi Capitals co-owner Parth Jindal, speaking to India Today, offered a candid assessment of Shaw's journey and his current struggles. ""Prithvi is a great kid but is misunderstood in many ways. I think, once in a while, we all need a jolt, and need to be shaken up from our slump,"" Jindal said.Jindal highlighted the high expectations Shaw faced early in his career, with comparisons to legends like Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara , creating an environment that may have hindered his growth. ""When all your life you grew up hearing that you are the special one, the most talented, and is the only other batsman in the world other than Sachin and Kohli to own an MRF bat, that tells you a lot. Somebody called him Lara, somebody called him Sachin, or the next big thing...so he grew up in that environment.""""Everyone from Mumbai cricket was talking about him. Mumbai has given us Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar, and now they were talking about him. So, this is that one jolt Prithvi needed. Till now he was on a fat IPL contract and playing across formats for Mumbai and was starting for Delhi,"" Jindal said.The Capitals co-owner further emphasized that Shaw's path forward requires rediscovering his passion for the game while addressing issues of fitness and commitment. ""He needs to work hard and get back to loving the game again, and work on his fitness and discipline. I hope he comes back and becomes the Prithvi Shaw he had known,"" Jindal added.Shaw's decline in recent years has been stark. Once touted as a potential future star for India, his performances in domestic and IPL cricket have been inconsistent, and his lack of fitness has drawn criticism. This auction outcome may serve as a crucial turning point in Shaw's career, as he now faces the challenge of rebuilding his reputation and earning his way back into top-level cricket.","Prithvi Shaw, base price Rs 75 lakh, failed to attract a bid at IPL 2025 mega auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

West Indies bowled out Bangladesh cheaply and then started their response in a strong fashion, reaching 70 for 1 on day two of the second Test in Jamaica .Bangladesh were bowled out for 164, after which the home team's skipper Kraigg Brathwaite and Keacy Carty took the Windies to stumps after losing opener Mikyle Louis (12), who was dismissed by Nahid Rana.West Indies lead the two-match series 1-0.Brathwaite, who has gone through a difficult run of form in 2024, displayed patience in crafting an undefeated 33 from 115 deliveries, while Carty remained not out on 19 from 60 balls. The pair has added 45 runs so far.Rana's spirited bowling provided some relief for Bangladesh after their batting lineup struggled against West Indies' fast bowlers, who took advantage of the inconsistent bounce and pace of the pitch. But he could take only wicket before play ended.Earlier on the second day, Jayden Seales delivered an exceptional bowling performance, securing impressive figures of four wickets whilst conceding just five runs across 15.5 overs.Despite experiencing frustration on the rain-affected first day due to dropped catches that limited him to a single wicket, Seales maintained his aggressive and economical bowling. His persistence was ultimately rewarded when he took the last three wickets of Bangladesh's first innings.The second morning saw Shamar Joseph make early inroads into the batting lineup, finishing with figures of 3 for 49.Shadman Islam, who had reached 50 not out with Bangladesh at 69 for 2 at stumps on day one, achieved the highest score of 64 before becoming the sixth batter to be dismissed. Captain Mehidy Hasan Miraz contributed 36 runs, which was the only other notable resistance.","West Indies bowled out Bangladesh cheaply and then started their response in a strong fashion, reaching 70 for 1 on day two of the second Test in Jamaica.

Champions Trophy in PAK: More drama as Jay Shah strongly objects PCB's PoK plans

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar has voiced his thoughts on the ongoing discussions surrounding the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 , set to be hosted by Pakistan.In a recent video, Akhtar provided a balanced perspective, acknowledging both Pakistan's stance and the broader implications of the situation.""You are getting paid for hosting rights and revenue, and that's fine—we all understand it. Pakistan's stance is also reasonable. They should have maintained a strong position—why not? Once we are able to host the Champions Trophy in our country and they are unwilling to come, they should share the revenue with us at a higher rate. That’s a good call,"" Akhtar remarked.However, he emphasized the need for Pakistan to adopt a positive approach, particularly regarding their participation in future tournaments in India.""In terms of playing in India in the future, we should extend a hand of friendship and go there. My belief has always been: go to India and defeat them there—India mein khelo aur wahi unhe maarke aao (play in India and beat them on their home ground). I understand that thehybrid model had already been signed earlier,"" he added.Akhtar's comments come as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) recently agreed to a hybrid model for the Champions Trophy, where India's matches will be played in Dubai.While this compromise allowed Pakistan to retain hosting rights, the PCB has also presented demands to the ICC, including equal terms for hybrid models in future ICC tournaments held in India.PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi reiterated the need for a fair system, stating, “It shouldn’t be that we travel to India and they don’t come to our country.”","Former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar has voiced his thoughts on the ongoing discussions surrounding the ICC Champions Trophy 2025.

Brief scores:

KOLKATA: Openers Abishek Porel and Karan Lal provided another good start to Bengal as they eased past Meghalaya by six wickets in a Group 'A' match of Syed Mushtaq Ali (T20) meet in Rajkot on Sunday.The win helped Bengal to catch up with Madhya Pradesh, who lost to Rajasthan earlier, on 16 points from five matches although MP still have a better net run-rate. Meghalaya, who have lost all their group stage matches so far, made a good start on electing to bat first after winning the toss.Their openers Arien Sangma (37, 36b, 4x2, 2x6) and Arpit Batewara (24,32b, 4x2) piled up 63 runs inside the first 12 overs before Prayas Roy Barman struck twice in the same over, castling both the batters. The Meghalaya innings never got going after that as they kept losing wickets at regular intervals.Larry Sangma played some attacking shots hitting three sixes and two fours to get 38 off 21 deliveries that saw Meghalaya finish at 127 for six in their 20 overs.Porel and Lal straightaway took the match away from the rivals by putting up a breezy 80-run stand in just 5.3 overs. But there was a minor scare when Bengal lost four wickets for the addition of just one run in the next eight balls.Aryan Bora had Lal stumped by Bhatewara for a polished 42 off just 16 deliveries and then had Shakir Gandhi caught by Arien Sangma in the last ball of the same over.Ranjot Khaira and skipper Sudip Gharami departed in the next over off Himan Phukan without disturbing the scoreboard as Bengal were reduced to 81 for four.But Porel continued to hold fort and got good support from Writtick Chatterjee (25*) as the duo took the side home in 11.5 overs only.

Despite a valiant 67 from Nikhil Kumar in the opener, India struggled with consistency in their batting lineup.Their top order failed to deliver against Pakistan’s disciplined pace attack, leaving the middle order under immense pressure.Bowlers like Ayush Mhatre and Samarth Nagaraj will aim to replicate their impressive performances with the ball, especially against a Japanese side that is yet to find its footing in the tournament.For Japan U19, this match is another opportunity to grow in stature despite a challenging start.They suffered a heavy defeat in their opener against UAE, where their inexperienced bowling unit struggled to contain the opposition.

Clashes erupted at a football match in N'Zerekore , Guinea , on Sunday, leaving many dead.According to hospital sources quoted by AFP, ""There are bodies lined up as far as the eye can see in the hospital. Others are lying on the floor in the hallways. The morgue is full.""""There are around 100 dead"", said one doctor, while another said there were ""dozens of dead"".According to witnesses, the anger was fueled by a referee's decision that was contested, after which the fans invaded the pitch and later also set the N'Zerekore police station on fire.Media reports indicated that the game was organised as part of a tournament dedicated to Guinea's current president and junta chief, Mamadi Doumbouya , who took control through a coup in 2021.In Guinea, these tournaments have become increasingly prevalent as Doumbouya appears to be positioning himself for the anticipated presidential elections next year, whilst political alignments continue to develop.In September 2021, Doumbouya, then serving as a colonel, led a successful coup against President Alpha Conde. Ironically, Conde had previously appointed Doumbouya to lead an elite unit responsible for protecting the president from such takeovers.Despite international demands and his initial commitment to transfer authority to civilian leadership by December 2024, Doumbouya has since reversed his stance and indicated he will retain power.","Clashes erupted at a football match in N'Zerekore, Guinea, on Sunday, leaving many dead.

'Good attitude again'

MADRID: Spanish champions Real Madrid beat Getafe 2-0 to move second in La Liga on Sunday with Kylian Mbappe finding the net after a difficult week.The French striker has been criticised in recent weeks for his form but after Jude Bellingham opened the scoring from the penalty spot, Mbappe slotted home a well-taken second.Later, Mbappe wasted three other big chances but Madrid were able to move within one point of league leaders Barcelona, who lost on Saturday at home against Las Palmas.Carlo Ancelotti's side have played one fewer game than the Catalans, and Atletico Madrid, third, who are one point behind.""(Mbappe) played very well, he was active, dangerous as always,"" said Ancelotti. ""He scored an important goal, he created chances in the second half and had a very active game, it's what we want from him.""Mbappe, playing in his favoured role on the left with Vinicius Junior out injured, was offered plenty of support by Madrid's fans.""The fans understand more than anyone what moment the team is in, and the players (are in),"" added Ancelotti.Getafe set out to slow the game down and they largely succeeded until Allan Nyom tugged down Antonio Rudiger in the area after half an hour.After Mbappe missed his penalty against Liverpool in the Champions League defeat at Anfield on Wednesday, Bellingham stepped up to take the spot-kick.The England international outfoxed David Soria to send Madrid ahead on the half-hour with his third goal in three league games.""Today Bellingham or Mbappe had to choose (who took the penalty), they both chose Bellingham,"" said Ancelotti.Mbappe doubled his team's lead with a superb strike seven minutes prior to the break, after Bellingham spread the ball out to him on the left flank.The France captain drove inside and curled home a low effort inside the far post for his eighth league goal of the season.Ancelotti took off Bellingham at half-time because of an apparent knock sustained in a collision with Soria, but later said he thought the midfielder would recover quickly.Mbappe produced a glorious chipped pass to put Brahim Diaz in behind early in the second period, but the Morocco international's effort sailed narrowly over the crossbar.The forward came millimetres away from scoring a second himself but after rounding Soria squeezed a shot just wide of the far post.Soria made a good save to deny Fede Valverde as Getafe battled to keep the scoreline respectable.Mbappe spurned another chance to score when he fired off-target after being played in again, but Getafe could not capitalise on his profligacy.John Patrick had the visitors' best chance with a powerful effort which hit the crossbar then the post.Mbappe had another chance in stoppage time but misfired from close range as his anxiety to prove his worth in a Madrid shirt following his summer move from Paris Saint-Germain continued to tell, despite his goal.Madrid face Athletic Bilbao in midweek, hoping to build on their run of three consecutive La Liga wins.""We've had a lot of injuries (but) we are there fighting, battling,"" said Ancelotti.

'A great day'

LIVERPOOL: Liverpool have been used to second best during Pep Guardiola's era at Manchester City , but a 2-0 victory over the crisis-hit champions left little doubt over who are the team to beat in this season's Premier League title race.Goals in either half from Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah at Anfield on Sunday did not do justice to the scale of the Reds' domination as City succumbed to a sixth defeat in a seven-game winless run.Arsenal and Chelsea are now Liverpool's closest challengers, nine points behind, with City 11 back and almost certain to finally loose their grip on the English top flight after an unprecedented four consecutive titles and six in the past seven seasons.Guardiola reminded the Anfield crowd of that fact by raising six fingers when taunted with chants of ""sacked in the morning"".The Catalan's defiance, though, could not mask the fact that City have rested on their laurels, while Liverpool have stepped up a level under Arne Slot.Slot appeared to have the impossible job of succeeding the much-loved Jurgen Klopp.The charismatic German brought Liverpool back to the top of English and Europeanfootball . His title triumph in 2019/2020 was the club's first for 30 years and the only blot on City's dominance in recent times.In contrast to Alex Ferguson's departure from Manchester United and Arsene Wenger's exit at Arsenal, Liverpool have turned a legendary figure leaving into a positive.Klopp did much of the groundwork himself, rejuvenating the squad over his final 18 months in charge with the signings of Gakpo, Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and Ryan Gravenberch.Slot's only summer signing, Federico Chiesa, has barely featured due to injury.But the injection of fresh blood, mixed with the experience of title winners in the prolific Salah, captain Virgil van Dijk, Andy Roberson and Trent Alexander-Arnold has proved a winning combination.Slot has been keen to give Klopp's legacy credit, but the Dutchman deserves his due for the small details that have produced a run of 18 wins from his first 20 games in all competitions.Robertson and Alexander-Arnold's narrower positions have left Liverpool less vulnerable in transition and contributed to them having the best defensive record in the league.Gravenberch has shone since being transformed into a holding midfielder, while Gakpo is finally delivering on his potential under his compatriot.Slot has also managed to keep Liverpool's momentum rolling despite constant speculation over the futures of Salah, Van Dijk and Alexander-Arnold, all of whom are out of contract at the end of the season.""City are a fantastic team, four times champions in a row and they have quality to punish any team,"" said Van Dijk. ""So, overall, it has been a great day.""It's game-by-game and stay calm. But games like this, when you win it like this, is always a good feeling.""It is not just the Premier League that Slot has so far bent to his will.Liverpool are also top of the Champions League with a perfect record from five games, including a memorable 2-0 win over Real Madrid on Wednesday.Victory over City capped a dream week, but the former Feyenoord boss was still keen to use the English and European champions as the benchmark for his side's aspirations.""Real Madrid and Manchester City have been and are so good, with managers that have won so many trophies, so it is always nice to come out of those situations as a winner,"" added Slot.""But they were able to win every single three days. We understand what we want to achieve is more than this winning once or twice, even against these big teams, if you want to win big things.""December may only be a day old, but already it is hard to see beyond Liverpool matching Manchester United's record tally for 20 English top-flight titles come May.",Liverpool beat Manchester City 2-0 in the Premier League on Sunday. Goals from Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah secured the win. Arne Slot's side are now nine points clear of Arsenal and Chelsea.

NEW DELHI: In a crucial La Liga encounter at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday, Real Madrid secured a 2-0 victory over Getafe , propelling them within striking distance of league leaders Barcelona .

Three-time Davis Cup winners Germany eased into the semi-finals with a 2-0 victory against Canada on Wednesday.Jan-Lennard Struff defeated Denis Shapovalov 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7/5) to avenge Germany's defeat in the 2022 quarter-finals by eventual victors Canada.Daniel Altmaier beat Gabriel Diallo 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 in the opening singles rubber to send Germany ahead in the quarter-final clash.Germany, who last won the competition in 1993, will face Netherlands in the final four after they defeated Spain to bring the curtain down on Rafael Nadal's 23-year career ""It was a very good, tough game, Shapa was firing his serves in, first serves and second serves... he was changing directions a lot, it was tough to read the serve,"" said Struff.""The court was pretty fast so it was tough to stay calm. I managed to stay in the game and in the set...""We're in the semis now, we're very happy, let's look forward to Friday.""Shapovalov clinched the first set against Struff with a fine forehand winner with the only break in the 10th game.Veteran Struff, world number 43, was up against the ropes for much of the second set but produced a break in the 11th game before holding to force a third set.The big-serving Shapovalov committed several double faults, with one resulting in Struff breaking for a 4-3 lead in the third set, moments after the Canadian had smashed his racquet onto the floor in frustration for losing the previous point.Shapovalov, ranked 56th, recovered to break for 5-5 as Struff faltered when serving for the match, leading to a tie-break.However the Canadian lost the match and the tie for his country with his 13th double fault.World number 88 Altmaier racked up a 5-0 lead in the first set tie-break against Diallo before closing it out to take the lead.In the second set Altmaier survived two break points in the first game and then broke himself in the 10th and final game to triumph as Diallo crumbled.""I wish I could have brought my team the point. They counted on me to deliver and I didn't deliver, so that's on me,"" said Diallo.Altmaier admitted he felt extremely nervous ahead of the match.""Definitely the nerves were a lot, I was saying to the captain in the morning when I was warming up I was really nervous coming up to the match,"" he said.""I guess (it) helps me a lot to communicate this openly, not to hide away my nerves.""","Germany beat Canada 2-0 in Davis Cup quarter-final in Malaga. Jan-Lennard Struff defeated Denis Shapovalov in straight sets. Daniel Altmaier beat Gabriel Diallo 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 in the opening singles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115512223,imgsize-85062,width-400,resizemode-4/115512223.jpg"

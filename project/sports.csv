Harry Brook press conference: On Yashasvi Jaiswal DRS controversy, India bowling, getting out on 99

""Harry... Harry Brook... Harry... Harry Brook""The Eric Hollies Stand at the Edgbaston Cricket Ground was at its loudest when Akash Deep gave India a much needed breakthrough in the final session of Day 3. After toiling hard for more than 61 overs and conceding at nearly five an over, the visitors finally had something to cheer for on what was a leather chasing day. The notorious spectators of the Hollies Stand were kept busy during the marathon 303-run stand between Brook and Jamie Smith, and they were up on their feet to give an epic send-off to the right-hander who was castled for a solid 158.When he walked in to bat, England were in deep trouble at 25/3. At first, he stabilised proceedings with fellow Yorkshireman Joe Root and then dominated with Jamie Smith. The rub of the green again went his way on a couple of occasions as he survived an umpire's call, nearly played one back on to his stumps but continued to hang on like he did in Leeds. And capitalised even better than he did at Headingley.At the start of play on a coldish morning, enough runs on the board meant India bowlers were going to have a spring in their stride and Mohammed Siraj , even without hitting the right rhythm, managed to remove Root and Ben Stokes off consecutive deliveries.84/5 and India had England on the mat. The approach and response was keenly watched during this delicate phase of the game, and England did what they do best - attack. And attack well.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Smith was a breath of fresh air and he raced to fifty, hundred and then 150, and punished India's six bowling options along the way. Brook played the perfect ally and tightened up as his innings progressed. From the urgency at the start to patience after crossing three-figures, two different Brooks were on exhibition but both frustrated India. And frustrated them for a very long time.India skipper Shubman Gill rotated his bowlers, changed the field, chased the deliveries but nothing worked for India on a surface which had nothing for the bowlers, especially when the Dukes went soft in the post Lunch session. The two bowlers - Washington Sundar and Ravindra Jadeja - who were expected to do the containing job, leaked runs at over 4.5 in the 31 overs they bowled, and returned wicketless. Nitish Kumar Reddy was only used as a filler for six overs and Prasidh Krishna continued doing Prasidh Krishna things as he sprayed it all over to concede 72 runs from his 13 overs.With nothing going their way, India's best bet was going to be the second new ball and the visitors first struck with Akash Deep who removed Brook and Chris Woakes, and Mohammed Siraj did a fine cleanup job to pick the final three wickets in quick succession, and complete his maiden fifer on English soil.During this period of play, Gill-led unit picked five wickets and conceded just 31 runs. The hosts were thus bundled out for 407 to give India a substantial 180-run lead.It was a weird England innings as six of their batters fell for ducks but they still managed to post 407, thanks to that big stand between Brook and Smith. On this pitch, in these conditions against England's strong batting lineup, India will take this lead with open arms but it would hurt them because there was another opportunity to close the game, this time with the ball, but some fine batting and erratic bowling didn't help their cause.Even after going with six bowling options, India were a two-man attack as the others lacked bite, and most importantly control. Both Akash and Siraj asked the right questions with the hard new ball, with Siraj in particular setting the stage alight with his six-wicket haul. He has been a workhorse for India in recent Test outings but his erraticness and somewhat poor luck hasn't given him the numbers he would have liked.For the rest of the match, and the series, he would hope it remains this way and the Hollies Stand gets behind him too. For a player who has been booed far too often, ""Mohammed... Mohammed Siraj... Mohammed... Mohammed Siraj"" will be music to his ears.",Mohammed Siraj takes his first Test wicket on English soil. Harry Brook and Jamie Smith put on 303 for the second wicket. England were bowled out for 407 but India lead by 180 runs. Akash Deep took three wickets in the final session to give India hope.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122255472,imgsize-1216999,width-400,resizemode-4/122255472.jpg"

Akash Deep press conference: On replacing Jasprit Bumrah, message from Gautam Gambhir and more

Poll Do you enjoy the lighthearted banter among commentators during cricket matches? Absolutely! It's entertaining. Sometimes, it can be distracting. Not really, I prefer serious commentary.

As the action on the field raged with gripping intensity during the second Test between India and England at Edgbaston, an equally spirited - albeit far more stylish - contest unfolded off the field among the Sky Sports commentary team. The prize? The coveted (and tongue-in-cheek) title of “Best Dressed Commentator.”With former players turned pundits in fine voice and finer threads, viewers were invited to judge the sartorial showdown. It sparked a wave of lighthearted banter, good-natured jibes, and classic English wit.It began with Michael Atherton calling out his colleague Nasser Hussain for breaching dress code etiquette. “In your three-quarter zip top. Breaking the dress code with no jacket and giving us all grief. Unbelievable,” Atherton said, taking aim at Nasser's casual fashion choice.But Nasser, ever the showman, hit back with a hilarious awards-style rundown: “Right, the votes are in. At the bottom, by some distance, Michael Scruffy Atherton. One shirt, no iron. About as scruffy as they get. Second from bottom, Ian Ward. Third from bottom, mid-table mediocrity - me. Mark Butcher has slipped down. Then we have double-breasted Broad. But Kumar Sangakkara does it better.”He crowned Dinesh Karthik runner-up - disqualified from top spot due to “the stripy shirt” - and declared the undisputed champion: Ravi Shastri “Not many can pull off the white jacket. Ravi Shastri is number one. Well played, Rav.”In the studio, the banter rolled on. “The man who looks like he should be making deals with Don Corleone has beaten both you two,” joked Butcher.Sangakkara responded in kind: “I think - a white jacket carried off in that style. Deserved winner.”Stuart Broad, mock-grumbling, added: “The concern is that Nasser was the only judge.”The fashion feud may be playful, but Shastri’s win was as convincing as one of his trademark sixes - delivered with flair, confidence, and that unmistakable swagger.","Ravi Shastri crowned 'Best Dressed Commentator' during second Test.

NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja dismissed England captain Ben Stokes ’ accusations of tampering with the pitch as mere mind games, following a heated exchange on Day 2 of the second Test at Edgbaston.The altercation unfolded after England’s Chris Woakes complained to the umpires that Jadeja was allegedly stepping onto the pitch's danger area, leaving visible marks. Stokes pointed out the scuff marks to Jadeja, saying, ""Look what you have done, mate.""Jadeja defended his actions after play, stating, ""But I was coming from here. I won't bowl there anyway. Why would I do that? My focus is on batting.""Addressing the tension with Stokes, Jadeja elaborated: ""He feels that I am making it rough for myself. In fact, he was making it rougher by using fast bowlers. I didn’t have to make it rough. He kept telling the umpire I was running on the wicket. But that was not my intention. I ran here and there a few times, but that was in his mind.""Jadeja played a crucial role in India’s dominant total of 587, scoring 89 off 137 balls in a 203-run partnership with Shubman Gill , who slammed a record-breaking 269. Jadeja's innings ended when he gloved a short ball from Josh Tongue to the keeper, narrowly missing out on a century.India’s commanding position was further solidified by reducing England to 77 for 3 by stumps, setting the stage for a strong Day 3.","India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja dismissed England captain Ben Stokes’ accusations of tampering with the pitch as mere mind games.

India staged a dramatic comeback on Day 3 of the second Test at Edgbaston, halting England’s charge with the second new ball after being pushed back by a massive 303-run partnership between Jamie Smith and Harry Brook.While India had made a roaring start on Day 3 by removing Joe Root and Ben Stokes in quick succession, with Stokes falling for a golden duck, the momentum shifted sharply as Smith and Brook dug in. Coming together at 84/5, the duo mounted a stunning counterattack. Brook compiled a superb 158 off 234 balls, while Smith showcased remarkable fluency to notch up 184 from just 207 deliveries. Their blend of aggression and control not only steadied England but also kept the Indian bowlers at bay through much of Day 3.Just as the match appeared to tilt in England’s favour, Akash Deep provided India the much-needed breakthrough with the second new ball. The pacer clean bowled Brook with a delivery that breached his defence, setting off a collapse that saw England tumble from 387/5 to 418 all out. They lost their last five wickets for just 31 runs.In the process, England recorded an unwanted statistical feat. Their six ducks in this innings happened for the first time in England's history, marking the highest number of players that got out for zero runs in a single innings in a Test.The previous record total was 365 by Bangladesh against Sri Lanka at Mirpur back in 2022. Their final total of 407 also became the lowest all-out score by any team that featured a 300-plus partnership and the highest with six ducks.Meanwhile, the game also brought to light a contrast from the first Test, where India’s 471 all out at Headingley stood as the lowest total ever to include three individual centurions.As India returned to bat with a commanding 180-run lead, they now have a prime opportunity to stretch their advantage and potentially put the match out of England’s reach.",India staged a dramatic comeback on Day 3 of the second Test at Edgbaston.

Poll Who impressed you more in England's fightback against India? Harry Brook Jamie Smith

Riding on sensational centuries from Harry Brook and Jamie Smith, England staged a remarkable fightback after being reduced to 84/5 following captain Ben Stokes’ golden duck. The pair not only rescued their side from trouble but also rewrote the record books in the process.Jamie Smith became the joint-third fastest England batter to score a Test century (balls needed) and etched his name into history as the only Englishman to register 100+ runs in a session before lunch, having not been unbeaten overnight. His aggressive approach perfectly complemented Brook's fluent strokeplay as the duo rebuilt England’s innings with authority.As Smith and Brook piled on the runs, the stump mic picked up a trademark moment featuring India’s vocal wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant. After Brook attempted an audacious new shot, Pant quipped, “New one. New shot, huh?” prompting a shared smile between the two.The comment came after Brook unexpectedly guided a ball behind the wicketkeeper despite Pant standing close by. What seemed like an attempt to nudge the ball to leg turned into an improvised stroke that even caught Pant off guard.While Brook was eventually bowled by Akash Deep for a commanding 158 off 234 balls, he had already done the damage, putting up a mammoth 303-run stand with Smith that swung the momentum back in England’s favour.India surged ahead earlier on Day 3 thanks to a fiery over by Mohammed Siraj, when he claimed the wickets of Joe Root and skipper Ben Stokes. This also meant that England claimed the unwanted record of losing three top-six batter for ducks at home.

Poll Do you think live exposure to Test cricket is beneficial for young players? Yes, absolutely! No, not really.

NEW DELHI: India U19 men’s head coach Hrishikesh Kanitkar revealed that it was VVS Laxman , the head of BCCI’s Centre of Excellence (CoE), who made it possible for the team to witness Day 2 of the ongoing Edgbaston Test, where India skipper Shubman Gill delivered a career-best masterclass of 269.During the second day’s play, the entire India U19 squad — led by promising Mumbai batter Ayush Mhatre — along with Kanitkar and other support staff, were spotted watching the match live from the stands. Kanitkar, a former India batter himself, emphasised that watching a full day of red-ball cricket live served as invaluable exposure for the young players — especially in terms of learning how to construct an innings in the longest format.“VVS Laxman was instrumental in arranging this. He was the one who actually said that it would be a good thing to go and watch this game. It's definitely a special occasion for any upcoming cricketer to be at a Test venue,” said Kanitkar in a video posted on bcci.tv on Friday.“The main thing I want them to take back from what we have watched so far, as a batter, is that not every ball has to be whacked for a four and six. You can still be extremely effective, score runs at a good rate, and still score a lot of runs, like what Shubman has done.When we go back, there will be a session on what they learnt from it.”“He has batted like a classical Test innings, but he has not just ground it. He has played his shots. He has chosen the right ball, getting into good positions. They can relate to it for sure that if this person succeeds at this level by doing the basic stuff very well, we can as well, and I think that will be the biggest learning,"" he added.Left-handed batter Vaibhav Suryavanshi — who has impressed with scores of 48, 45, and 86 in the ongoing youth series — also spoke about how much Gill’s knock meant to the youngsters.“I am feeling very good. This is my first Test match of watching in England, and I am seeing how the game is going.”“I am feeling very good. We all came to watch the match. We got a lot of inspiration because Shubman Gill is a role model for us, and everyone's dream is to play red-ball cricket for their country.”Young Punjab spinner Anmoljeet Singh, who shares his roots with Gill, said the outing to Edgbaston gave him even more motivation to chase his India dream.""Yesterday evening, sir told us that everyone has to go and watch the match. We were ready to go and watch the match from morning itself.”“Gill was batting at 114 at that time, and it felt good that he was playing, and we went and watched his batting. Representing India is a big achievement. When I see them, I get motivated to play for India like them and become like them,” he said.India U19 currently lead the five-match Youth ODI series 2-1 against England and are set to play the fourth game at New Road, Worcester, on July 5, with the final match scheduled at the same venue on July 7.",India U19 men’s head coach Hrishikesh Kanitkar revealed that it was VVS Laxman who made it possible for the team to witness Day 2 of the ongoing Edgbaston Test.

BENGALURU: Former India coach Igor Stimac who was sacked by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) last year and replaced with Manolo Marquez, who stepped down on Wednesday, said he was not surprised to hear that the Spanish gaffer had to leave the job after being in charge of the national team for just eight games.“The AIFF is run badly, without any clear idea on what to and how to do it,” Stimac told TOI. Stimac, who lost his job after India crashed out of the World Cup qualifiers had won a compensation of $ four lakh as compensation as the AIFF sacked him with one year left on his contract.Presenting his arguments on India's downward spiral from a world rank of 102 in 2023 to 127 in 2025, the former Croatian international said Indian players are not improving their skills through tournaments like the Indian Super League “Players are not progressing their game in such leagues like ISL which is without enough game intensity and pressure of results. Also, there's no relega- tion and lack of quality games,” Stimac said.He also said the national team does not get enough time to prepare. “FIFA windows are not long enough for preparation time when facing strong opponents. So the AIFF needs to reschedule the ISL calendar in favour of the national team.”Stimac also said the Indian footballers should come out of their comfort zone. “Unrealistic players’ salaries in ISL are putting players in a comfort zone.

Former Wales and Real Madrid star Gareth Bale is reportedly preparing a dramatic return to football, but not on the pitch, raher, in the boardroom. The 35-year-old, who retired in 2023, is leading a consortium bidding to purchase Cardiff City, the club based in his hometown.Bale has submitted an offer exceeding €46 million to acquire the Welsh side, a move that would see him pay less than half of the €99 million Real Madrid shelled out for his services back in 2013. The former Galáctico said, “We’re interested in Cardiff. It’s my hometown club, where I grew up, and my uncle (Chris Pike) played for them,” as quoted byCardiff City, recently relegated to League One, is currently owned by Malaysian businessman Vincent Tan, who is reportedly open to selling. The club has already rejected an undisclosed initial offer from Bale’s consortium, but talks are expected to continue.Earlier reports stated that Bale’s group had explored acquiring other clubs, including a failed attempt to buy Plymouth Argyle. However, his interest in Cardiff appears deeply personal and long-term.“Being part of an ownership group would be a dream come true,” Bale said. “I’d love to be part of Cardiff’s growth and take it to the Premier League, where it deserves to be.”If successful, Bale would join a growing list of footballers turning owners, following the likes of David Beckham and Gerard Piqué, as he aims to drive Cardiff’s resurgence from League One back to the top flight.",Gareth Bale is leading a consortium bidding to purchase Cardiff City.

I’m looking forward to working closely with them to prepare for Berlin, and I’m sure we can have a good weekend together.""Mahindra Racing Team Principal Frederic Bertrand also added, “His achievements speak for themselves, and he’s been very impressive when he’s tested a Formula E car in the past. The benefit of having this confirmed so far in advance is that we have had plenty of time to get him fully integrated with the team, to prepare him properly for the race weekend, and give him the best opportunity to go out and showcase what he can do. ”Also Read: Nyck De Vries collides with Jake Dennis at Jakarta E-Prix; fans compare him to Max Verstappen In the last race in Jakarta, Edoardo Mortara secured second place on the podium.

With four wins and three additional podiums in 12 rounds, Rowland leads this year’s Driver Standings by a massive margin. As the season nears its conclusion with the Berlin double-header and the London double-header remaining, the Nissan driver is almost certain to lift the championship trophy.Things began to look up for Oliver Rowland after he decided to switch from Mahindra Racing to Nissan last year. This season, he is all set to lift the Formula E World Championship trophy. Although he had a lackluster start in Sao Paulo, he bounced back with his first win of the year in Mexico. Soon after, he secured two podiums in Jeddah, including a win. He continued his strong form with double podiums in both the Monaco and Tokyo double-headers.After his last win in Tokyo, he brought his four-year-old daughter, Harper, to join him on the podium.

There was a lot of pressure to go through.I was looking forward to the race being over, to be honest, and when it was over... when I saw her face, I just couldn't help but be super emotional. ”""[The atmosphere] was amazing.

What sets the Berlin E-Prix apart

What’s challenging about the Tempelhof Circuit?

Past Berlin E-Prix winners

Season 11 of Formula E is now nearing its close, with four races remaining across two venues. Next up is the Berlin E-Prix, scheduled from July 11–13. Berlin is the only venue to have hosted a Formula E race every season since the championship's inception, making it one of the most special events on the calendar for multiple reasons. It has been held annually without a miss since 2015, and its scenic venue — the historic Tempelhof Airport — adds to its charm. Here are some interesting facts about Rounds 15 and 16 of the Formula E season in Berlin.One look at the Tempelhof circuit explains why the Berlin E-Prix is so special. With imposing aircrafts parked on one side of the barrier and a vast expanse of open space on the other, it’s arguably one of the most picturesque tracks in motorsport.Formula E cars are second only to airplanes when it comes to reaching top speeds — hitting 322 km/h in less than a minute. The most distinctive aspect of the Tempelhof Airport circuit is that it was originally designed for airplanes to take off and land, making it a unique surface for electric racing.The surface of the 2.343 km-long Tempelhof circuit is composed of layered concrete slabs designed for aircraft operations.While it supports Formula E racing, it presents challenges in energy management, tyre wear, and grip. The hot summer temperatures in Berlin can further test the drivers. Despite that, the wide layout, long corners, and even an indoor tunnel make the track exciting and full of overtaking opportunities.The Berlin E-Prix is a home race for DS Penske driver Maximilian Gunther. He won the event in 2020 and secured a third-place finish in 2023. The German driver recently expressed his excitement on Instagram. Reflecting on the Jakarta race, Gunther wrote, “Didn’t go our way this Saturday in Jakarta. Thanks for all the love, Indonesia. Now all eyes on Berlin – my home race.”However, it is TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa who holds the record for the most Berlin E-Prix wins, having triumphed three times — twice in 2020 and once in 2024. Envision Racing’s Sebastien Buemi, Lola Yamaha ABT’s Lucas di Grassi, and TCS Jaguar Racing’s Nick Cassidy have each won the race twice.Also Read: Season 11 Berlin Rookie Test: Formula E teams announce nominations, eligibility rules explained However, this year’s race may see a new winner, as has been the case in several recent Formula E rounds.

It was a dusty yet thrilling Formula E race in Jakarta, with the championship returning to Indonesia after two years. Formula E has now shared some of the best videos from the Jakarta E-Prix for fans to relive the Indonesian race again and again. The real footage appears as eye-catching as scenes from a racing movie — complete with synchronized reactions from the audience and ground staff.The shots from the Jakarta E-Prix were shared by Formula E on Instagram with the caption: “Our race in Jakarta would have made a beautiful movie.” The first video is a still camera shot from a turn on the circuit, as the GEN3 Evo cars speed down the track. It is followed by a clip of a Lola Yamaha ABT driver getting into the car ahead of the race. There are also a few shots of the audience and ground staff moving their eyes from one direction to another as the cars race past.The post also includes a glimpse of Cupra Kiro driver Dan Ticktum celebrating his win by standing on his car amid loud cheers from his team members. There are additional shots from different corners of the circuit, each offering a unique visual experience. One clip features Jake Dennis, who, despite securing pole position, was hit by Nyck De Vries during the race — ruining his chances of winning or finishing on the podium.A comment from Mahindra Racing’s Instagram page read: “If Wes Anderson directed FE.” A fan agreed, saying, “Accidentally, the dust and pollution in Jakarta matched with Wes Anderson’s color palette.”One fan reacted to the post, “Love the still camera angle.” Another said, “Ha, it certainly would.” One more wrote, “Straight out of a movie scene!” Another comment read: “I hope this event will still be held in Jakarta next year.

Formula E drivers with the most front row starts

Does pole position — or a front row start — guarantee a win? Well, in most cases, it does. If not, it at least enables the driver to finish the race on the podium or earn some points to add to their score in the Driver Standings. This season, it’s Nissan’s Oliver Rowland who has clinched five front row starts and is leading the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings. He is far ahead of the competition and is almost certain to have secured the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship title this year.Oliver Rowland is far ahead of the competition at the top of the Formula E Driver Standings with 172 points. He has taken pole twice and started on the front row in three other races this year.There is hardly any scenario in which anyone can beat him in the remaining four races — except one. If Pascal Wehrlein, who is second in the Driver Standings, wins and Rowland fails to score any points, then only can Rowland’s top spot be challenged. However, that is highly unlikely, and Rowland will most probably lift the world championship trophy in London with ease.TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein has three front row starts, including two poles.This suggests that front row starts do play a major role in a driver’s chances of a podium finish.Pascal, however, is behind Taylor Barnard, who has delivered the most impressive performance on track this year. The NEOM McLaren driver recorded four front row starts, including two poles this season. He already has four podium finishes in what can be considered his first year as a full-time Formula E driver.Meanwhile, DS Penske driver Maximilian Gunther, TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa, and Andretti’s Jake Dennis have two front row starts each this season. Among others who have grabbed pole position are Nissan’s Norman Nato, Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries, Cupra Kiro’s Dan Ticktum, and Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy.Also Read: Oliver Rowland’s daughter Harper turns four, Nissan driver shares glimpse of her birthday celebrations There are four more races to go before the current Formula E season comes to an end.

Watch: Extrication practice in Formula E

Every motorsport involves risk, where a single crash can prove life-threatening. Formula E has maintained a strong safety record over its eleven seasons so far. However, as a precautionary measure, Formula E drivers undergo extrication practice once a year to ensure they are familiar with the emergency protocols in case of an incident. Recently, NEOM McLaren driver Sam Bird participated in one such practice session. A glimpse of the session was shared with fans on social media, offering insight into this important aspect of motorsport safety.The video shows Sam Bird acting as an injured driver while the FIA Formula E safety team carefully lifts him out of the car and places him on a stretcher. The procedure is designed to avoid further injury, particularly to the neck or any broken bones.McLaren FE shared the video on Instagram with the caption: “Earlier today, Sam completed his extrication practice with the @fiaformulae safety team. This is an exercise that happens at each race with a different team each time. This is for both the safety of the drivers and the extrication team should an incident occur where the driver would need assistance exiting the car.

Stoffel Vandoorne reveals reason behind his crash at Jakarta E-Prix

Stoffel Vandoorne’s long-awaited win in Tokyo

Formula E Season 11 nears its finale



Stoffel Vandoorne has opened up about his crash into the barrier at the Jakarta E-Prix. The Maserati MSG Racing driver had started from 14th on the grid and was showing promise before a heavy collision with the barrier forced him to retire from the race. The disappointing weekend in Jakarta came just weeks after his long-awaited win in Tokyo — his first victory of the season.Taking to Instagram, Vandoorne shared a video of the crash along with a few snapshots from Jakarta, including a selfie with a fan. Explaining what went wrong, he wrote, “Not the best ending to my race in Jakarta. Lost regen and rear brakes with a few laps to go and ended up hitting the wall pretty hard. Looking forward to a little break now and reset for Berlin.”Despite the setback, fans flooded the comments with messages of support.

He currently sits 13th in the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings with 50 points.Prior to Jakarta, Vandoorne also competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France, although the race didn’t yield the results his team had hoped for.Also Read: All about Stoffel Vandoorne - the Tokyo E-Prix Round 8 winner Teams now head to Berlin for a crucial double-header on July 12 and 13, marking Rounds 13 and 14 of the Formula E World Championship.

Carlos Alcaraz battled past Jan-Lennard Struff to reach the Wimbledon last-16 on Friday before women's top seed Aryna Sabalenka dug deep to beat Emma Raducanu in a high-class match. Both players avoided the fate of Australian Open champion and sixth seed Madison Keys, who joined the mass exodus of top seeds.It is only day five of Wimbledon but just four of the top 10 women's seeds remain, with half of the men's top 10 also ousted.Men's second seed Alcaraz eventually overcame German world number 125 Struff 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to stay on track for a third straight Wimbledon crown.But the Spaniard will have to cut out his errors if he is to become just the fifth man in the Open era to perform that feat.""I knew it was going to be really difficult. I had to be really focused. His game suits the grass with the big serves,"" said the 22-year-old.""It's stressful. To be honest, I was suffering in every service game today, 0-30, break points down.""I'm really pleased that I was fighting, running for every ball and making great shots.""Alcaraz, watched by former England captain Gary Lineker and former world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua, made 28 unforced errors in an inconsistent display on Centre Court.But he conjured enough moments of magic to eventually subdue his opponent and book his place in the fourth round, where he will meet Russia's Andrey Rublev.Alcaraz is yet to show his best form after being pushed to the brink in a five-set win over 38-year-old Italian Fabio Fognini in the first round while he looked below his best again against British amateur Oliver Tarvet.The women's draw is bereft of star names after the departure of a succession of top players.Keys' 6-3, 6-3 defeat by Germany's Laura Siegemund means only world number one Sabalenka is still alive at the All England Club out of the top six women's seeds.Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini and Zheng Qinwen have already fallen by the wayside.Sabalenka, last on Centre Court, refused to be cowed by former US Open champion Raducanu, who fed off the energy of a partisan crowd to produce an electric performance under the roof.But the powerful Belarusian won the big points, saving a set point in the first set and staying strong in the second to beat her 40th-ranked opponent 7-6 (8/6), 6-4.Sabalenka is a three-time Grand Slam champion but has never been beyond the semi-finals at Wimbledon.""I had to fight for every point like crazy,"" said Sabalenka, who was impressed by the volume of support for Raducanu.""What an atmosphere,"" she said. ""My ears are still hurting, honestly. It was super loud. Every time you were cheering her, I was trying to tell myself to just pretend that you were just cheering for me. I had goosebumps.""Earlier at the All England Club, Japan's four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka lost in three sets to Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.Osaka has not reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam since she won the Australian Open in 2021 but is still hungry for success.""I feel like while I still have the opportunity to try to do it, I want to, even though I get very upset when I lose, but I think that's my competitive nature. That's also the younger sister syndrome,"" she said.There were also wins for Britain's Sonay Kartal, 13th seed Amanda Anisimova and Elise Mertens.US men's fifth seed Taylor Fritz avoided a third straight five-setter, beating Spain's Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-4, 6-3, 6-7 (5/7), 6-1.Britain's Cameron Norrie saw off Italian Mattia Bellucci in straight sets to qualify the quarter-finals for the first time since 2022, when he reached the last four.Highly promising Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca was ousted by Chilean qualifier Nicolas Jarry.It took US men's 10th seed Ben Shelton just 71 seconds to complete his second-round match, sealing a 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 win against Australia's Rinky Hijikata after the match was halted on Thursday due to failing light.",Carlos Alcaraz battled past Jan-Lennard Struff to reach the Wimbledon last-16.

Poll Should the All England Club continue to make exceptions to their dress code for tributes? Yes, it's a respectful gesture. No, they should stick to the rules.

Wimbledon honored Liverpool star Diogo Jota , who died in a car crash with his brother Andre Silva in Zamora, Spain on July 3, by allowing Portuguese player Francisco Cabral to wear a black ribbon during his doubles match on Friday, making an exception to their strict all-white dress code.The 28-year-old Jota and his brother were traveling to catch a ferry to England for pre-season training when the accident occurred. The tragedy happened shortly after Jota's wedding to Rute Cardoso, with whom he had three children. Following his tragic demise, Premier League clubs, players and teammates shared messages and condolences for Jota's family.The All England Club made a special allowance for Cabral to wear the black ribbon on his shirt sleeve during his second-round doubles match.Cabral, who learned about the news while driving to Wimbledon, shared his thoughts about Jota: ""I know what he's been through, what he conquered through his career and through his life. So he's just very inspiring for me.""""I just wish all the best for his family. I know they have good people around them so I hope they can get through it,"" Cabral added after losing his match with Austrian partner Lucas Miedler against Czech pair Petr Nouza and Patrik Rikl.Cabral praised Jota as ""an idol, such an icon, such a good person.""British doubles player Neal Skupski, a passionate Liverpool supporter, had brought a black armband for his Thursday match but chose not to wear it.Regarding wearing the armband in future matches, Skupski stated, ""Maybe in the next couple of days.""","Wimbledon honored Liverpool star Diogo Jota by allowing him to wear a black ribbon.

LONDON: It might just be the best deal in all of major professional sports: Tennis fans can get a chance to watch stars such as Carlos Alcaraz compete on Centre Court at Wimbledon by forking over just 15 pounds — about USD 20 at the current exchange rate. That's instead of Friday's price of nearly $220 for the best seats at the grass-court Grand Slam tournament's biggest stadium. Face value there rises as the event goes on, hitting nearly $370 by the end of Week 2, then going up again for the singles finals.The secret to saving so much cash? The official resale service. It allows anyone already on-site with a ticket to sign up via the Wimbledon app for a daily lottery to get into one of the top three courts at a cut rate, including about $13 each for No. 1 Court or No. 2 Court.Those spots are offered up to the All England Club by spectators who leave before play ends.Wimbledon offers cheap tickets to its biggest courts when fans leave early“It's an elite tournament in terms of the players, but it's not elite to get in, which is part of the appeal,” said Ed Hogan, a retired 69-year-old from Reading, which is a little more than an hour west of Wimbledon. “The concept of resales is great.It's recycling at its best — sharing the joy.”The All England Club wouldn't say how many tickets get resold.“We're selling the same ticket twice,” said the club's operations manager, Michelle Dite, “and the primary reason is to make tennis as accessible to as many people as possible.”All England Club ticket resales raised about $300,000 for charity in 2024Money from resales goes to charities via the Wimbledon Foundation. Nearly $80,000 was raised through the first three days of this year's tournament; last year's total was about $300,000.Wimbledon has done resales since 1954, but until last year, folks hoping to take advantage of the deal needed to stand in a line once they were on-site, hope they were there soon enough — and hope enough tickets were returned.Now, though, that “line” is virtual.Here's how it works:After opting in on the app and getting their phone scanned by 2:30 p.m. at kiosks on-site or near the Wimbledon Queue, where thousands of people camp out at a local park for up to 24 hours in hopes of getting full-price tickets for main courts or grounds passes for smaller ones, fans then wait for a text message giving the good news that they were one of the lucky ones chosen for the resale, which runs from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m.They have 10 minutes to confirm they still want a used ticket for the rest of the day, and another 20 minutes to get themselves to the green-and-brown ticket resale booth behind No. 1 Court to show the QR code that lets them pay for the cheap tickets.Spending $13 instead of $115 to see Ben Shelton at Wimbledon“You're not stuck in one place forever,"" said Henry Thompson, 38, a high school math teacher from Missouri. “This is much more efficient. Took 30 seconds. Much better.”Thompson, who was wearing a blue hat with the Wimbledon logo, really wanted to see 10th-seeded American Ben Shelton, so he entered the resale lottery and was able to get a seat for No. 2 Court for $13 instead of $115.“It's beneficial to the sport to give people access to those courts for a reasonable price,” said Marcos Giron, a 45th-ranked American who won first-round matches in singles and doubles this week. “It's a wonderful thing.”Chen Pinjung, who just finished medical school in Taiwan, waited in the queue for six hours, paid 30 pounds ($40) there for a grounds pass, then also got herself into No. 1 Court via a resale for an additional $13 — instead of the $150 it could have cost to see 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina win there Thursday.“If everybody knew how that works, I'm sure everybody would apply,” said Rafael Garcia, who was with his girlfriend, Diana Meneses, and her brother, Gustavo Meneses. “We saw that (resale) office last year, but we didn't know how to do it. Now we will.”","Wimbledon offers cheap tickets to its biggest courts when fans leave early. The All England Club wouldn't say how many tickets get resold.

What time is the

Wimbledon curfew

? Why is it imposed?

Taylor Fritz's match against Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard was suspended due to the curfew at Wimbledon in London. (AP)

American tennis player Ben Shelton expressed frustration when his Wimbledon second-round match against Rinky Hijikata was suspended due to darkness despite being just one game away from victory. The match was halted at 9:30 PM due to the bd light on the outside courts, with Shelton leading 6-2, 7-5, 5-4 on No.2 Court.The suspension came at a crucial moment when Shelton was preparing to serve for the match. The 22-year-old player immediately confronted the chair umpire about the decision, requiring intervention from another rules official who had to explain the ruling while restraining him.The match was taking place on Court No.2, which lacks both a roof and artificial lighting capabilities. The timing of the suspension particularly sparked controversy as it followed a 30-minute discussion about whether to continue play into the third set.The ESPN broadcasting team expressed their disbelief at the situation during their live coverage. ""Oh my goodness. This is unbelievable,"" the commentary team stated as the events unfolded.Fans took to social media to voice their concerns over the decision to move the match a day later. One fan posted on X: ""Yo @Wimbledon that's just embarrassing. You spend 30 mins talking about whether or not to keep playing. You ultimately start the third set. And you let them play all the way until 5-4, and right when Ben Shelton is about to serve for the match, that's when you call it. Pathetic.""Another fan expressed their frustration: ""Absolutely UNBELIEVABLE they're suspending Ben Shelton / Rinky Hijikata. For a major not to be able to continue beyond 9:30 is absolutely insane. This is beyond comprehension right now.""A third fan supported Shelton's reaction: ""Ben Shelton has every right to be livid. After all this, you suspend the match right before Shelton is about to serve for it?? Absolute ridiculous decision yet again by tournament officials.""As Shelton left the court, he acknowledged the crowd with a fist pump and showed appreciation for their support. The match is scheduled to resume on Friday, July 4.While not true in this case, Wimbledon has a curfew time that was imposed during Taylor Fritz's first round match against Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.The Wimbledon curfew is strictly set for 11 pm local time. This rule was introduced in 2009 when the Centre Court's roof was opened.In a 2018 statement, Wimbledon explained the purpose of the curfew: ""The 11 p.m. curfew is a Planning Condition designed to balance the needs of local residents with the demands of hosting an international tennis tournament in a residential area. Considerations such as transportation and ensuring spectators can get home safely are also important factors.""While the curfew is usually enforced without exception, there have been instances where it has been broken. In 2012, Andy Murray won his match against Marcos Baghdatis at 11:02 pm. The umpire decided to allow Murray to complete the final game rather than waiting until the next day to finish it.","Ben Shelton's match against Rinky Hijikata was suspended at 9:30 PM due to bad light.

Poll Do you think Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz make a good mixed-doubles team? Yes, they complement each other well No, they should stick to singles Undecided I don’t follow mixed doubles

LONDON: The US Open’s reimagined mixed-doubles competition — offering $1 million winner’s prize — may be sparking romantic vibes, courtesy the Emma Raducanu-Carlos Alcaraz partnership, but is there even a shred of truth to it? Raducanu, 22, gets asked about it in press at Wimbledon, where she’s in the third round, and there are almost life-size caricatures of the Briton and the Spaniard up at the Village, at SW19. Tennis is manifesting it seems.Alcaraz’s “I asked Emma” declaration may have fuelled the rumours.Raducanu, who won the US Open as an 18-year-old in 2021, and Alcaraz, who won the first of his five majors in New York aged 19, go back a long time.The Spaniard lent to the moment when he called his partner “the boss ”, saying she could play the match and he would basically fill in wherever he was needed to. Raducanu was quick to come back with a question of her own, “I would like to know how much of the court he can cover in New York?”“I’m just gonna serve and I’m gonna pull myself away and let her play,” Alcaraz said. An ambitious journalist even tossed the dating question at Raducanu. “We’re just good friends,” she responded, smiling. While the romance rumours may be good for the event, it is as clear as the London summer sky that the pairings — for most of the 16 teams in the event — have been engineered by the organizers.World No. 1 Jannik Sinner, who is teaming up with Emma Navarro, spoke to the American for the first time at Wimbledon.In his pre-Championship media interaction, Sinner was asked how the partnership came about.“I met her yesterday for the first time. We never talked, we never texted. It’s actually a funny story,” he said, “The tournament wanted us to kind of play together because certain teams were already set up.” The 23-year-old added: “I’m very happy to play with Emma. I told her already, don’t get pissed with me if I miss volleys. Doubles, I struggle.”Navarro, Wimbledon’s 10th seed, joined in the fun during a television interview, saying, “He (Sinner) was begging me to play. I said, ‘Yeah sure. I guess I’ll play with you. You’re not the best player, but I’ll make an exception and try to get a better partner next year!”There may be a breakup, though, that could throw a spanner in the works for the US Open. If Greek media is to be believed, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa are no longer a couple. The break-up is believed to have happened at Wimbledon.Greek Tsitsipas and Spanish Badosa have done all the things people who breakup in the era of social media do — unfollow each other and delete all their pictures together.","Emma Raducanu-Carlos Alcaraz partnership sparks romance rumours.

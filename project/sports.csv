IPL: RCB mentor Karthik questions Chinnaswamy pitch after twin defeats

'Our never-give-up attitude won us the game': Nehal Wadhera

In what was an evening for the bowlers, it was a batter whose resolute display made the difference in the end at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium . All of Arshdeep Singh, Marco Jansen, Yuzvendra Chahal and Harpreet Brar took two wickets for Punjab Kings . In the second essay, Josh Hazlewood picked three while Bhuvneshwar Kumar took two wickets.But it was Nehal Wadhera 's unbeaten 33 from 19 balls that made the difference as PBKS beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru and inflicted the third home defeat on the Rajat Patidar-led side.There were valuable runs in the first innings too. Tim David , the Player of the Match, struck an unbeaten fifty, his first in the IPL , as RCB reached a respectable 95/9 in the rain-affected match that was reduced to 14 overs.But Wadhera's tide-turning show, hitting three fours and three sixes, came against the run of play. As Hazlewood breathed fire and took two wickets in an over, PBKS desperately needed someone to stand up and face the onslaught.The 24-year-old left-hander pummelled leg-spinner Suyash Sharma for a couple of sixes to allay his team's worries.A composed Wadhera played a big hand as Punjab Kings eventually crossed the line, swelling their tally to 10 points to move up to second place on the points table behind leaders Delhi Capitals.The job was half done by the PBKS in the first innings. Clever bowling restricted RCB to a disappointing total after Shreyas Iyer opted to bowl first.The decision proved right as his bowlers plucked three wickets in the power play segment.Phil Salt perished in the first over itself, trying to hammer Arshdeep Singh (2/23) out of the park and stumper Inglis completed a good catch.Virat Kohli did not last long either, as Marco Jansen peddled 20 metres back to pull off a terrific catch off Arshdeep.The Royal Challengers' power play phase score read a sorry 26 for three as Liam Livngstone too departed without making any effect.Yuzvendra Chahal (2/11) made his return to his one-time IPL home Chinnaswamy Stadium memorable with the wicket of Jitesh Sharma.Amidst the ruins around him, skipper Rajat Patidar played some handsome shots, and none better than a pick-up off his pads off Bartlett that soared over mid-wicket for a six.But RCB soon received a body blow as Patidar (23, 18b) could not clear Bartlett at sweeper cover off Chahal, who teased the batters with those tossed up, fuller deliveries.Jansen (2/10), who used short-pitched balls to good effect, had his own moments as he jettisoned Krunal Pandya and Impact Sub Manoj Bhandage as RCB innings unravelled.It was despite a few big blows by Player of the Match David that included three sixes in a row off left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar, who also had a share in RCB's spoils with two wickets.","Punjab Kings beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru in IPL 2025. Nehal Wadhera's unbeaten 33 from 19 balls made the difference. Tim David struck an unbeaten fifty, his first in the IPL.

Bombay Sport Exchange EP 3: Kane Williamson exclusive on NextGen cricketers to watch out for

NEW DELHI: ' Koi garden mein nahi ghoomega ’—a fiery on-field remark by Rohit Sharma during a Test match—took social media by storm earlier this year. The Indian skipper has now finally opened up about the story behind the viral line that quickly became a fan favourite.The incident took place during the second Test against England in Visakhapatnam in February 2024. Rohit was caught on the stump mic urging his teammates to show more urgency during a critical phase of the match. The phrase instantly struck a chord with fans and has been widely shared online ever since.Rohit has now explained the context of his now-famous words.“It was in Vizag, I saw the over ended and the players were leisurely walking as if they were in a garden. No one was running, there was no urgency in the field. I was fielding in the slip, we had spinners bowling from both ends. The game was hanging by a loose thread, it was an important game, we had to win. I had told the players in the morning that we need to put in some extra effort but they were having fun in the ground,” Rohit said on JioHotstar.He added that India desperately needed a breakthrough at that point, and he was frustrated with the lack of intensity.“So I saw it for two-three overs and then said things can't go on like this, you can't play cricket like this. Everyone was just going with the flow which annoyed me and then I told everyone not to be like that. A partnership was going on, I was desperate to get a wicket. In such moments everyone needs to put in a collective effort. At that moment, I saw everyone being busy with themselves which I didn't like,” he added.Meanwhile, Rohit’s recent form in the IPL continues to be a concern. On Thursday, Mumbai Indians skipper Hardik Pandya brought him in as an Impact Player against Sunrisers Hyderabad, but the veteran batter’s struggles persisted. He managed just 26 runs before falling to Pat Cummins.So far, Rohit has scored only 82 runs in six innings at a disappointing average of 13.66.The lean patch has drawn sharp criticism from former India opener Virender Sehwag, who has not held back in his assessment. Sehwag cautioned Rohit to safeguard his legacy and even suggested that it might be time for the former MI captain to consider stepping away from the format.",Rohit Sharma's 'Koi garden mein nahi ghoomega' comment took social media by storm.

NEW DELHI: New Zealand’s batting icon Kane Williamson shared his vision for the next era of cricketing greatness during an exclusive conversation with senior journalist K. Shriniwas Rao on TimesofIndia.com's latest episode of Bombay Sport Exchange When asked to name his “next Fab Four,” Williamson chuckled and replied, ""The five players that come to mind would be Yashasvi Jaiswal (India), Shubman Gill (India), Rachin Ravindra (New Zealand), Harry Brook (England) and Cameron Green from Australia.""Also See: MI vs SRH Coming from a player who is himself part of the modern ""Fab Four"" alongside Virat Kohli Steve Smith , and Joe Root, this endorsement carries tremendous weight.With over 9,276 Test runs at an average of 54.9, including 33 centuries, Williamson’s words reflect not just respect but a keen eye for future legends.The young Indian opener is enjoying a meteoric rise in the longer format, having already scored 1,798 runs in 19 Tests at an average of 52.9, including 4 centuries.His calm temperament and aggressive shot-making have made him a force at the top of the order.He was also part of India’s T20 World Cup-winning team, showing his growing presence in white-ball cricket, although he is yet to make his ODI debut.Gill’s classical style and adaptability have seen him become a regular in all three formats.In Tests, he has scored 1,893 runs in 32 matches with 5 centuries, averaging 35.While he hasn't quite replicated his white-ball dominance in the Test arena, he is widely regarded as the future captain of India's white-ball sides, thanks to his maturity and consistency in ODIs and T20Is.One of the most consistent and dependable new faces in the New Zealand setup, Rachin has been a key figure across all formats.In Tests, he’s scored 1,057 runs in 15 matches, averaging 37.8, with 2 centuries, including a career-best 240.His ability to slot into any role and contribute with both bat and ball makes him an all-format asset for the Kiwis.Harry Brook has been a revelation in red-ball cricket for England.In just 24 Tests, he has amassed 2,281 runs at a stunning average of 58.5, with 8 centuries and a high score of 317.His explosive style and aggression align perfectly with England’s ""Bazball"" strategy.Recognizing his potential as a leader and limited-overs performer, Brook has now been appointed England’s white-ball captain, marking a new chapter in his career.Despite battling recent injuries, Cameron Green remains a crucial all-rounder for Australia, offering balance with both bat and ball.In Tests, he’s scored 1,377 runs in 28 matches at an average of 36.2, with 2 centuries and a top score of 174*.His 13 sixes and 152 fours reflect his ability to shift gears, and when fully fit, Green is a game-changer in all three formats.Williamson’s nod to these five reflects both current performance and future potential.As the ""Fab Four"" era edges toward its twilight, this ""Fab Five"" could well be the torchbearers of the next golden generation of Test cricket.","Kane Williamson names five players to watch out for in next generation of cricketers.

Poll Should a warning be given to keepers for having their gloves in front of the stumps? No, it's not necessary Only in certain situations Definitely

Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) spinner Varun Chakravarthy has raised questions over a controversial ""no-ball"" call during the Mumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad match at the Wankhede Stadium on Thursday.In the seventh over of the match, Mumbai Indians opener Ryan Rickelton was dismissed by leg-spinner Zeeshan Ansari, with Pat Cummins taking an easy catch at cover.However, the drama unfolded when the fourth umpire stopped Rickelton near the boundary rope, and the delivery was called a no-ball.The third umpire found that wicketkeeper Heinrich Klaasen had his gloves in front of the stumps when the ball made contact with the bat. Rickelton received a free-hit, but he failed to capitalize on it.The third umpire's decision was not appreciated by Varun Chakravarthy.""If the keeper's gloves come in front of the stumps, it should be a dead ball and a warning to the keeper so that he doesn't do that again!!! Not a no-ball and a free hit!! What did the bowler do? Thinking out loud!! What do you all think???"" he wrote on X.However, Rickelton was dismissed in the next over as Harshal Patel deceived him with a slower delivery. He scored 31 off 23 balls.Mumbai Indians defeated Sunrisers Hyderabad by six wickets with eleven balls to spare.Earlier, Sunrisers, who had successfully chased 246 in their previous match against Punjab Kings at home, failed to get going and ended up with a below-par score of 162/5.Sunrisers' next opponent will be Mumbai again on April 23 in Hyderabad.

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma 's scores in the ongoing Indian Premier League season read: 0, 8, 13, 17, 18, and 28. The Mumbai Indians stalwart, who has led the franchise to five IPL titles, is currently enduring a rough patch with the bat.On Thursday, skipper Hardik Pandya brought Rohit in as an Impact Player against Sunrisers Hyderabad , but the veteran batter’s struggles continued. He managed just 26 runs before being dismissed by Pat Cummins.In six innings so far, Rohit has scored only 82 runs at a disappointing average of 13.66.His lean run has drawn sharp criticism from former India opener Virender Sehwag , who didn’t mince words. Sehwag cautioned Rohit about protecting his legacy and even suggested that it might be time for him to consider stepping away from the format.“If you look at Rohit's IPL numbers in the last 10 years, he scored more than 400 runs only once. So he is not the kind of player who thinks that I need to score 500 or 700 runs. If he thinks, he might. When he became the Indian captain, he said that he wanted to be the player who wants to cash in on the powerplay and take the chances, so he wanted to make all the sacrifices alone, but he is not considering the fact that at the end of the day when he is not performing, it is your legacy that is getting hurt,"" Sehwag told Cricbuzz.""Ab uska jaane ka time aa gaya, (It's already time for him to retire), and before retiring, you would want to give fans something to remember you by, and not moments that force them to think, why are they not dropping him,” he said.“Take 10 balls extra, but at least play and give yourself a chance. He has been getting out to that pull shot many times against the back of the length deliveries. So he should decide that in one innings he will not play the pull shot at all. But who will explain it to him? There should be someone telling him to play normal cricket. When I was there, Sachin, Dravid or Ganguly used to tell me to play normal cricket,” he added.A disciplined performance from the bowling unit, spearheaded by Jasprit Bumrah and captain Hardik Pandya, powered Mumbai Indians to a four-wicket win over Sunrisers Hyderabad in a low-scoring clash at the Wankhede Stadium.Will Jacks emerged as the standout performer for Mumbai, picking up two key wickets and contributing a crucial 36 with the bat to steer the team to their second consecutive victory in IPL 2025 .This marked Mumbai Indians’ third win of the season, taking their tally to six points and lifting them to seventh place in the standings—breaking free from the congestion of teams stuck at four points near the bottom.

Rajat Patidar-led Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) will lock horns against Shreyas Iyer's Punjab Kings (PBKS) in Match No. 34 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Friday. RCB are currently placed at the third position, whereas Punjab are at fourth.As a team, Punjab will be high on confidence after their 16-run win over KKR in a recent low-scoring thriller. But they will be well aware that RCB, which has depth in batting and bowling, will be a harder opponent to overcome.Two former RCB players, Yuzvendra Chahal and Glenn Maxwell, will have noticed Bengaluru batters' struggle against slow bowlers R Sai Kishore, Kuldeep Yadav, and Vipraj Nigam in Bengaluru. RCB mentor Dinesh Karthik mentioned after their loss against Delhi Capitals that the Chinnaswamy pitch was surprisingly on the slower side, and both Chahal and Maxwell will be eager to exploit that.Chahal, fresh from his four-wicket haul against Kolkata Knight Riders, is a master of lengths rather than of ""magic balls."" The leg-spinner lures with offerings wide of off-stump, and the batters need to reach out to the ball for big hits, often resulting in catches in the deep.After RCB's consecutive losses, Dinesh Karthik hinted that the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium pitch has not delivered what the team management desires. “In the first two games, we have asked for good pitches. But it’s turned out in this way where it’s been challenging to bat on for sure.

That has been the case in both the games that we have played."" The Chinnaswamy Stadium pitch has historically been a batter's paradise, but in this year's IPL, it has been a bit tricky.

Bombay Sport Exchange EP 3: Kane Williamson exclusive on NextGen cricketers to watch out for

The members of the International Cricket Council ( ICC ), led by the powerful Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ), has conveyed a very strong message on the World Cricketers Association (WCA) report. During the recent four-day meet in Zimbabwe, Chief Executives Committee (CEC) of the global cricket body discussed the report, and made it clear that the players can either choose to play the Indian Premier League (IPL) or side with the WCA.The WCA is believed to be arguing that they represent the players but the ICC has shrugged it off saying they represent cricket boards of their respective countries.""The BCCI took a strong stand in the CEC meet and it was unanimously backed by the other members of the CEC. The message is clear - the players can either choose to play the IPL or side with the WCA. There seems to be no ambiguity. As far as the share from the gaming rights revenue is concerned, it's nobody's business. A player represents their cricket board and members of those cricket boards form the ICC. Where and how does WCA come into picture?,"" question those in know of the developments.The all-powerful CEC, featuring representatives from Full Members and Associate Members, had a unanimous view on the subject, and even questioned the existence of WCA.""Who are they? What is the World Cricketers Association? Where have they come from? These are the immediate questions which come to mind. To me they are nothing but a trade union making needless noise. Clearly they don't have the (players') best interests in mind and just want to create distractions. If the ICC reacts (to) or entertains such trade unions mushrooming now and then, then the game will not be in the right space,"" said a member of the CEC who was part of the WCA discussion.Amongst the radical suggestions made by the WCA in its 31-page report, the most notable was on overhauling the global cricket body's revenue sharing model. Under the section 'ineffective global distribution models', the WCA highlighted how more than 50% of the revenue is going to the largest three countries with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) pocketing 38.5% of the entire pie.During the recent survey conducted by the WCA, in which the self-anointed world body questions the logic behind BCCI's share from ICC revenue, a total of 64 individuals were spoken with. And the names are mentioned in the report. Another member of the CEC asserted no changes are expected in the revenue model, and the point wasn't even deliberated upon.""Before going to the details of the report, first we need to understand who the WCA is, isn't it? And why will the ICC discuss changing the revenue model when it was agreed upon by the members when the Finance and Commercial Affairs Committee had made its recommendations. You fix something when it's broken, and how is this broken?. When the existing model was agreed upon, it was duly noted that the BCCI, the Indian market in particular, is bringing in the most money to the table. So where is rocket science? It's pure math - you bring more, you take more. That's what happens in sales right? More incentives for better sales. What is the need to complicate matters?,"" questions a veteran administrator.The FICA changed its name to World Cricketers Association in June last year but its existence is yet to be recognised by the world's biggest cricket board - the BCCI. The ICC has in the past had discussions with FICA but a dialogue with WCA looks far-fetched at the moment.""Was any decision taken on the WCA report? No. Will a decision be taken on the WCA report? Highly unlikely. So there is no question of a dialogue at the moment. The ICC is still trying to understand the fine prints of the organisation and some of the recommendations are absurd to say the least. They just can't ridicule the ICC and question its existence in the ecosystem. Everyone wants better and bigger things for cricketers but one also needs to understand that there are other moving parts which need to be taken care of,"" explains the administrator.The TimesofIndia.com reached out to Mr Gaurav Saxena, global cricket body's new General Manager – Events and Corporate Communications, for a comment but didn't get a response. The news article will be updated the moment ICC responds to TOI.com's queries.","The World Cricketers Association (WCA) report was presented to the International Cricket Council (ICC) during a recent meet in Zimbabwe.

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings continued their impressive IPL 2025 campaign with a commanding five-wicket victory over Royal Challengers Bengaluru in a rain-shortened 14-over encounter at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium on Friday.With this result, PBKS now sit comfortably at second with 10 points, while RCB’s woes deepen as they slump to their third loss in seven matches, currently finding themselves at fourth on the IPL 2025 points table.After being asked to bat first, RCB had a forgettable outing, managing just 95/9 in 14 overs.Despite a valiant unbeaten 50 from Tim David at the end of the innings, the rest of the batting line-up collapsed under pressure from Punjab's disciplined bowling attack.Arshdeep Singh, Marco Jansen, Harpreet Brar, and Yuzvendra Chahal all shared the spoils, dismantling the RCB innings with ease.In response, PBKS chased the target down in just 7.4 overs, with some much-needed contributions from young opener Priyansh Arya (16), the aggressive Prabhsimran Singh (13), and a steady finish by Nehal Wadhera (33).Even though the chase saw a few hiccups with three wickets falling, the visitors never looked in trouble.This win boosts Punjab Kings’ net run rate (0.308) and places them firmly in the playoff mix as we approach the halfway mark of the tournament.For RCB, however, the loss appears to be a hurdle in an otherwise satisfactory season that has seen them do well with both bat and ball, leaving them with a few questions to answer.As the competition heats up, PBKS will look to carry this momentum forward, while RCB face an uphill task to turn things around from here.","Punjab Kings beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru by five wickets in IPL 2025.

MUMBAI: Filled with gratitude after the Mumbai Cricket Association named a stand at the iconic Wankhede Stadium after him at its AGM on April 15, India's Test & ODI captain Rohit Sharma on Friday described the feeling of the rare honour as ""unreal.""""It’s an unreal feeling to have a stand on my name & I will forever be grateful - You never know how long you would play, but to get these honours is something I could never imagine,"" Rohit said at a glitzy inauguration ceremony of the third edition of the Mumbai T20 League , set to kick off on May 26.Though he won't be able to participate in it due to India's upcoming tour of England, the 37-year-old will be the face of the league, which is being relaunched after the first two editions in 2018 & 19.Recalling his early days as an Under-16 Mumbai cricketer who would struggle to catch a glimpse of Mumbai's Ranji Trophy stalwarts at the Wankhede Stadium, Rohit said it was an emotional moment to have a stand named after him at a venue where he would once not even be able to enter as a junior cricketer.""The Wankhede Stadium now has a Rohit Sharma stand. I never dreamt something like this when I was starting out playing cricket. I remember those days when I wanted to enter and watch Mumbai Ranji team players in 2003-04. After our Under-16 team's training at the Azad Maidan, we would travel across the track to watch Mumbai Ranji players. Those were the days. When I played my first game, and now to experience that is a different experience,"" the veteran opener said.Rohit revealed that his success mantra was simple: 'Forget about what happened: focus on what will come next.""My success mantra is only one- forget what happened, focus on what will come next. You don't have control how your today will go, focus on the next day and what to do. Prepare for the next day and forget the present or those things which are not in your control. We must not lose faith in ourselves. You can't change what has happened. We need to be 100% ready and believe that we can turn things around.""lauding the MCA's contribution in his epic career, Rohit said, ""Without them, I wouldn't be sitting here and talking about my game. They gave me that opportunity at the right time to play with stalwarts. The MCA played a big part (in my career). Whenever I want to train on their grounds or want the practice pitch ready, it's all there. For any athlete, getting to practice is a challenge. They ensured that the ground is always available (for training). The MCA has looked after its cricketers.""Meanwhile, Roadway Solutions India Infra Ltd and Royal Edge Sports & Entertainment were unveiled as the two new team operators for the upcoming season, along with six other team owners.","India's Test & ODI captain Rohit Sharma described the feeling of the rare honour as ""unreal"" Rohit said it was an emotional moment to have a stand named after him at a venue where he would once not even be able to enter as a junior cricketer.

NEW DELHI: We always have that one rain-interrupted game in Bengaluru every IPL season, and tonight could be that day. The drizzle has returned just in time to delay the toss for the RCB vs PBKS clash at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium .As expected, Bengaluru’s weather continues to flirt with unpredictability.

It could bring the dew factor into play if the match gets underway later.RCB, despite a perfect record on the road (4-0), have been winless at home, suffering twin defeats at Chinnaswamy.Both came after losing the toss and being put in to bat, tough ask on a pitch that turns into a paradise for chasers under dew.PBKS, on the other hand, arrive brimming with confidence.They pulled off the lowest successful defence in IPL history against KKR, thanks to Yuzvendra Chahal’s vintage 4/28 spell.A return to his former home ground, where he’s still the leading wicket-taker, makes for a juicy subplot.RCB's bowling, especially Josh Hazlewood’s struggles at home, has been a concern.Meanwhile, PBKS boast two of the season’s most dangerous powerplay hitters in Priyansh Arya and Shreyas Iyer.With both teams sitting on 8 points, the winner tonight will jump to the top of the table alongside Delhi Capitals, setting up a spicy rematch in New Chandigarh on Sunday.",RCB face PBKS at the M.

April 18, 2025 officially marks the day when the Indian Premier League (IPL) turns 18, considering the first-ever IPL match was played on the same day back in 2008.The tournament has produced some incredible moments of brilliance over the years, enthralling one and all with constant twists and turns. Even a target of 250 seems chaseable within 20 overs, showcasing the incredible power and quality of batting.Without much ado, here's a look at 18 landmark moments which make the IPL such an incredible league:Any discussion on the IPL would be incomplete without taking a look at former New Zealand batter Brendon McCullum's unbeaten 158* off 73 balls in the IPL opener against RCB. McCullum smashed 10 fours and 13 sixes during his knock, helping KKR post a jaw-dropping total of 222. RCB were bowled out for 82, resulting in a triumph by 140 runs for KKR.While the discussion around McCullum's 158* certainly dominates the limelight, not many people are aware of then-CSK batter Michael Hussey's 116*(54). Hussey smashed eight fours and nine sixes in his knock against Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) on the second day of IPL 2008, helping CSK post 240. Two centuries were scored across the opening two days of IPL, which few are aware of.Rajasthan Royals (RR) stunned one and all after winning IPL 2008, following a triumph in the edition's final against MS Dhoni-led CSK. The match went down to the last ball where Shane Warne and Pakistan cricketer Sohail Tanvir pulled off a tight single to help their side record a historic win.The IPL 2009 final witnessed an incredible sight as the two teams which had finished in the last two positions during IPL 2008, managed to reach the edition's final. Not many backed the Deccan Chargers to pull off a triumph against RCB after captain Adam Gilchrist was dismissed for a duck. However, the players fought together as a unit to pull off a sensational win by six runs in a nail-biting match.CSK became the first team to win the IPL in two consecutive editions, pulling off the feat in IPL 2010 and 2011 under MS Dhoni's captaincy. The Chennai-based franchise showcased its dominance against MI and RCB, getting the job done under extreme pressure.KKR had been identified as perennial underachievers till Gautam Gambhir took over KKR's captaincy in IPL 2011. Gambhir developed the team's resolve, helping them reach the edition's final for the first time ever in IPL 2012. Manvinder Bisla emerged as a surprise hero for KKR, smashing 89 runs off 48 balls as KKR won the IPL for the first time ever, denying CSK a hat-trick of IPL titles.Mumbai Indians (MI) won the IPL for the first time ever, defeating CSK in the IPL 2013 final. Rohit showcased his calibre as a captain, helping MI take revenge against CSK for the defeat in the IPL 2010 final.West Indian cricketer Chris Gayle set the stage on fire with his incredible performance against former IPL franchise Pune Warriors India (PWI), smashing an unbeaten 175 off 66 balls. Gayle's unbeaten 175 is still the highest score in the league's history. His knock comprised 13 fours and 17 sixes.MI managed to pull off an incredible chase against RR, despite being handed a challenging target of 190 runs in nearly 14 overs. Aditya Tare smashed a six off the last ball, helping MI qualify for the playoffs of IPL 2014.MI all-rounder Kieron Pollard nearly got into a physical fight with then-RCB pacer Mitchell Starc following an exchange of words in an IPL 2014 match. Pollard nearly flung his bat at Starc, reacting in anger following a remark by the Australian pacer.The first-ever Super Over took place in IPL 2009 between KKR and RR. Both teams scored 150 runs in their respective 20 overs. Yusuf Pathan helped RR chase the required 16 runs in only four balls.West Indian pacer Alzarri Joseph recorded the best spell in IPL history so far, picking six wickets while conceding 12 runs in an IPL 2019 match between MI and SRH.CSK won the IPL in their first season after returning to the league following a two-year ban, pulling off a dominant win against SRH in the IPL 2018 final.Rohit Sharma became the first captain in the history of IPL to win the tournament five times with a franchise, following MI's league triumph in IPL 2020.IPL franchise Punjab Kings (PBKS) chased down a target of 262 against KKR at the Eden Gardens in IPL 2024, recording the highest run-chase in IPL history.SRH registered the highest total in the history of the tournament, after scoring 287 runs against RCB in IPL 2024.The first hat-trick in IPL history was recorded by Lakshmipathy Balaji while representing CSK in IPL 2008 against KXIP. He accounted for the dismissals of Irfan Pathan, Piyush Chawla, and VRV Singh.Fans got to witness two Super overs for the first time in an IPL match between MI and then-KXIP back in the 2020 edition of the tournament. Mohammad Shami emerged as the hero for KXIP, helping them push the match till the second Super Over. Chris Gayle secured the win in the second Super Over, chasing down the target of 12 runs in four balls.","The Indian Premier League (IPL) turns 18 on April 18, 2025.

Manchester, Apr 18, 2025 -Manchester United came from 4-2 down in extra-time to beat Lyon 5-4 in a remarkable Europa League quarter-final to progress 7-6 on aggregate on Thursday.United's season looked over when Lyon came from 2-0 down to lead by two goals with just six minutes remaining at Old Trafford despite having captain Corentin Tolisso sent off.However, a Bruno Fernandes ' penalty, Kobbie Mainoo's strike and Harry Maguire's header capped a stunning finale to set up a semi-final meeting with Athletic Bilbao.""I felt that here everything is possible,"" said United boss Ruben Amorim . ""After the 4-3, the penalty from Bruno, you feel that you can change the game.""The Red Devils sit 14th in the English top flight and defeat would have almost certainly meant missing out on European football entirely next season.Instead they are just three games away from a European trophy and the lifeline of direct access to the riches of the Champions League next season.""Everybody in this moment believes it is possible,"" added Amorim.""One moment can change a lot of things in the players' minds.""United's history is built on dramatic late fightbacks, but few have been more remarkable than this to leave Lyon shellshocked.The home side got off to a flying start thanks to a fine team goal as Fernandes released Alejandro Garnacho down the right and his cross picked out Ugarte to slot in just his second goal since joining the English giants from Paris Saint-Germain.Amorim's decision to restore Andre Onana in goal was under scrutiny.The Cameroonian had been dropped for Sunday's 4-1 thrashing at Newcastle after two costly errors that led to both Lyon's goals in last week's 2-2 first leg draw.Those mistakes came after a war of words with former United midfielder Nemanja Matic, who labelled him ""one of the worst goalkeepers in United's history"".The 29-year-old rewarded his manager's faith with a couple of important stops to prevent Lyon levelling through Paul Akouokou and Rayan Cherki.At the other end, a United side that have often looked laboured and lacking in ideas all season, suddenly clicked into gear in the first 45 minutes.United doubled their lead in first-half stoppage time when Maguire's long ball was expertly controlled by Diogo Dalot, who then fired in off the inside of the post.Garnacho should have killed the tie off within minutes of the restart for the second half when he shot straight at Lucas Perri with Fernandes begging for a pass for a tap in.But the defensive deficiencies and mental fragility of Amorim's side were exposed in a collapse that threatened to cap a miserable campaign.Alexandre Lacazette flicked on Moussa Niakhate's header and Corentin Tolisso swooped to head in and give the visitors a lifeline.Nicolas Tagliafico then prodded in at the back post despite Onana's attempt to scoop it off the line.Just as Lyon were in the ascendency Tolisso gave them a mountain to climb again with a soft second yellow for a trip on Casemiro.Yet, it did not initially matter as Cherki confirmed his status as one of Europe's rising stars with a powerful drive that left Onana motionless.Lyon's other prized asset, Malick Fofana, was then chopped down by Luke Shaw inside the area and Lacazette confidently dispatched the resulting spot-kick.Another penalty at the other end, though, kickstarted the fightback as Fernandes fired home after a VAR review for a foul on Casemiro.Substitute Mainoo showed why he had been thrust in an unfamiliar forward role with a composed finish to level on 120 minutes.Barely 60 seconds later Maguire completed the comeback with a towering header at the back post.""In this moment it is difficult to believe what has just happened,"" said Lyon coach Paulo Fonseca.It is the first time ever in European competition that five goals have been scored in extra-time.",Manchester United came from 4-2 down in extra-time to beat Lyon 5-4 in a remarkable Europa League quarter-final to progress 7-6 on aggregate.

NEW DELHI: Arsenal secured a historic 2-1 victory against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday, advancing to the Champions League semifinals for the first time since 2009 with a 5-1 aggregate score.The match featured crucial VAR interventions in two penalty decisions, with Arsenal maintaining their impressive first-leg advantage of 3-0 from London.Arsenal will now face Paris Saint-Germain in the semifinals, while Inter Milan, who defeated Bayern Munich, will meet Barcelona in the other semifinal matchup.Real Madrid, the defending champion and 15-time European winner, failed to produce one of their trademark comebacks at the Bernabeu, falling short of the last four for the first time since 2020.""There was a lot of talk coming here about (Real Madrid) coming back, because they've done it so many times before, but we had so much belief and confidence from that first game to come here and win the game,"" said Arsenal's Declan Rice, who had scored twice in the first leg through free kicks. ""We knew we were going to suffer, but we knew we were going to win. We had it in our minds and now we've done it in real life.""The match's momentum shifted early when VAR overturned a penalty for Real Madrid following a hold on Kylian Mbappé, after a five-minute review with the score at 0-0.Arsenal had earlier missed their own VAR-awarded penalty when Bukayo Saka failed to convert from the spot.Saka later redeemed himself by scoring in the 65th minute after receiving a pass from Mikel Merino, though Madrid quickly equalized through Vinícius Júnior following a defensive error by William Saliba.Gabriel Martinelli sealed Arsenal's victory with a stoppage-time goal, assisted by Merino.""This is one of the best nights in my football career, for sure,"" Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta said. ""It's a really special one against a team that has been an inspiration for a lot of us in this competition. To win this tie in the manner that we have, we can be very proud.""Mbappé's substitution in the 75th minute due to an apparent injury drew jeers from some Bernabeu supporters, marking another disappointing Champions League campaign for the French star.""It's a tough moment,"" Madrid's Lucas Vazquez said. ""We tried but in the end we couldn't achieve our goal. We'll come back stronger. Madrid always does.""Real Madrid's task was challenging from the outset, facing an Arsenal team that hadn't lost by a three-goal margin in nearly three years. Only four teams in Champions League history had overcome a three-goal first-leg deficit at home.The match began with early drama as Madrid had a goal disallowed after two minutes when Mbappé was caught offside.Arsenal maintained their unbeaten record against Real Madrid, extending it to four matches, including their previous Champions League knockout stage victory in 2005-06.The game featured significant VAR involvement, with Arsenal's penalty awarded after review showed Raúl Asencio holding Mikel Merino during a corner kick.Another VAR review led to the reversal of Madrid's penalty claim after initially being awarded for a hold on Mbappé by Rice.The victory marks Arsenal's return to the Champions League semifinals after a 15-year absence, with their last appearance ending in elimination by Manchester United in 2008-09.",Arsenal defeat Real Madrid 2-1 in Champions League quarterfinals.

""So there were a lot of emotions but I had to stay in the match, I couldn't think of the goal, I had to remain focused.""The French defender remained optimistic about Inter's prospects in the competition.""We're not putting limits on ourselves,"" Pavard told broadcaster Amazon Prime. ""We have a great team, we have really great players, with staff that have been working well for two years.""The match began in challenging conditions, with wind and rain affecting play at San Siro.Bayern created early chances, with Pavard blocking Michael Olise's attempt and Alessandro Bastoni making a crucial tackle to deny another Olise opportunity.Inter gradually settled into the game, with Hakan Çalhanoğlu narrowly missing the target with a long-range effort in the 33rd minute.Bayern broke the deadlock seven minutes into the second half when Kane converted Leon Goretzka's pass to level the quarterfinal on aggregate.Inter responded quickly, with Martinez scoring from a corner despite an initial miscontrol, leading to passionate celebrations with the home fans.Pavard extended Inter's lead three minutes later, heading in another corner to put the Italian side in control.Bayern found a late equalizer through Eric Dier's unusual looping header from a tight angle, setting up a tense finale.The other Champions League semifinal will see Paris Saint-Germain face Arsenal, who defeated Real Madrid 2-1 to advance 5-1 on aggregate.Inter's victory maintains their hopes of repeating their 2010 treble success under current manager Simone Inzaghi.","Inter Milan beat Bayern Munich 2-2 in Champions League quarterfinal second leg.

""It was a house where, occasionally, a doctor would come to see him.""She described finding the house in deplorable conditions after her father's death, stating it was ""disgusting, and it smelled like urine.""Dalma also revealed she had attempted to visit her father days before his death but was denied entry by his lawyer and an assistant.Prosecutors allege Maradona endured a ""prolonged, agonizing period"" before his death, having battled cocaine and alcohol addiction for decades.The trial, which had faced delays, is expected to continue until July with nearly 120 witnesses scheduled to testify.The defendants are accused of abandoning their patient and pursuing a course of action despite knowing it could result in his death.","Dalma Maradona testified in court on Tuesday in San Isidro, Argentina, stating that her father's death in November 2020 could have been prevented if his medical team had provided proper care.

Kolkata: Is Jose Molina ’s Mohun Bagan Super Giant the best team in Indian Super League ’s 11-year-old history?Finishing the 2024-2025 season with a remarkable Shield-Cup double, with record-breaking 19 wins and 52 goals, Mohun Bagan have set a benchmark for other teams to emulate. It’s perhaps ideal for them to complete the double with a come-from-behind 2-1 win over Bengaluru FC at their boisterous fortress — the Salt Lake Stadium — which was brought to its feet in game after game in salute of a genuinely special team at play and its repertoire of promise and panache.History will remember Sergio Lobera ’s Mumbai City FC as the first team to do the ISL double when, backed by the financial and technical might of the City Football Group which owns Man City, they achieved the target in Goa in 2020-2021 at a time when the world was existing in a bubble.Molina’s Bagan, in a way, made the real noise. Like Mumbai City of five seasons ago, they too have had a strong financial backing from principal team owner Sanjiv Goenka. Like Lobera’s side, Molina’s team also has had the strongest squad in the league. Bagan’s ascent to a triumphant finish to the league, many believe, looked destined before the season started rolling.Of course, Lobera’s FC Goa in 2019-20 and Des Buckingham’s Mumbai City in 2022-2023 were special in their own rights, but there was also a lingering lament that both these teams failed to explore their full potentiality.True that football, just like life, doesn’t always follow scripts of one’s liking. Credit to Molina for turning his team into a winning machine running on the engine of consistency, character and never-say-die mentality.Take for example the Spaniard’s use of substitutions in the second half here on Saturday, bringing Ashique Kuruniyan and Sahal Abdul Samad in place of an off-colour Liston Colaco and an ineffective Anirudh Thapa.“Sahal and Ashique had their moment in the final. You need great players on the bench who can wait for their moment and change the game,” Molina said after the match. “But at the end of the day, there’s no secret to success. It’s all about hard work and belief,” the Bagan coach pointed out.","Mohun Bagan beat Bengaluru FC to complete the ISL Shield and Cup double. Jose Molina’s Bagan, in a way, made the real noise.

Liverpool moved within touching distance of the Premier League title after a dramatic 2-1 win over West Ham at Anfield on Sunday, thanks to a late header from captain Virgil van Dijk . The result, coupled with Tottenham 's 2-4 defeat to Wolves, widened Liverpool’s lead at the top to 13 points over second-placed Arsenal with just six matches remaining.The Reds rebounded from a stuttering run of form — including defeats to Fulham, Newcastle and Paris Saint-Germain — with a gritty performance. Mohamed Salah ignited Liverpool’s charge in the 18th minute with a brilliant run from halfway, sliding a perfectly timed ball to Luis Diaz , who tapped in from close range.Though an unfortunate own goal from Andy Robertson — deflecting off Van Dijk — briefly pegged Liverpool back in the 86th minute, redemption followed swiftly. Van Dijk rose to meet Alexis Mac Allister’s corner just three minutes later, sealing a vital victory.“In the 18th minute, Mohamed Salah sprinted away on the halfway line, accelerating towards the West Ham area and caressing a perfectly weighted pass to Diaz, who had the simple task of slotting home from six yards,” the club noted.Liverpool could secure their 20th English league championship as early as April 20 if they defeat Leicester and Arsenal slip up at Ipswich.Elsewhere, Tottenham’s domestic woes deepened as Wolves cruised to victory at Molineux.

How Nico Mueller secured the top spot

Andretti driver Nico Mueller and his race engineer Bertrand Mermine have surged to the top of the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard following a dramatic Miami Grand Prix, where post-race penalties reshuffled the final standings in Mueller’s favour. Though he originally crossed the line in 10th, Mueller was promoted to 4th, thanks to a well-timed strategy and a dash of late-race chaos. His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace. The season concludes with an award for the top-ranked pairing.After Round 5 in Miami, the leaderboard has Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne and his race engineer Thibault Arnal on number 2. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries and race engineer Tom Bayles are in third position in the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard.The FIA Formula E Instagram account also shared the update, posting:“@nico.mueller51 overtaking his way up the rankings! With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued. Drivers including Norman Nato, Robin Frijns, Oliver Rowland, Sam Bird, and Taylor Barnard were penalized 10 seconds each for misuse of Attack Mode, while Nick Cassidy received a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits.Also Read: Formula E Miami E-Prix 2025: Jake Hughes crashes at chicane, here’s how the multi-car collision changed the outcome.

He drives Nissan’s electric car in the Formula E World Championship and represents Cadillac Hertz Team Jota in the World Endurance Championship in the Hypercar category.Norman Nato was the first to cross the finish line at the recently held Miami E-Prix and could have even lifted the trophy had the results not undergone a massive reshuffling due to penalties. He faced a penalty for misuse of the Attack Mode and was disqualified from the race, while Pascal Wehrlein of TAG Heuer Porsche was declared the winner. However, the decision was soon changed, with Nato being pushed back to sixth position, bringing a slight breather for the Nissan driver.Nato had been missing from the scene ever since the terrible fate he suffered at the iconic Homestead-Miami Speedway.

Formula E is now in its 11th season since its debut in 2014, and the electric motorsport has achieved impressive success, carving its own identity despite the dominance of Formula 1. One of the key indicators of this success is the growing grid of 11 teams and 22 drivers—one more than the 10 teams in F1.

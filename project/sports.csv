Poll How should Chelsea handle the situation with Mudryk? Support him until proven guilty Suspend him indefinitely Terminate his contract

Chelsea winger Mykhailo Mudryk has been charged by England's Football Association with violating anti-doping rules after failing a drugs test.Mudryk has not played for Chelsea since November 28 following his provisional suspension by the FA for an ""adverse finding in a routine urine test"" in December. The Ukraine international at the time said he was in ""complete shock"" and he ""never knowingly used any banned substances"".But Mudryk could face a potential ban of up to four years under FA rules. Confirming the 24-year-old has been charged with the offence, an FA statement on Wednesday said: ""We can confirm that Mykhailo Mudryk has been charged with anti-doping rule violations alleging the presence and/or use of a prohibited substance, in terms of regulations three and four of the FA's anti-doping regulations. ""As this is an ongoing case, we are not in a position to comment further at this time. ""Signed from Shakhtar Donetsk in January 2023, Mudryk was reported to have had the prohibited performance enhancing substance meldonium in his positive test.Chelsea launched their own investigation into the doping allegation last year and had been waiting for the results of the 'B' sample test to support or contradict the initial 'A' results.Earlier this month, Mudryk's number 10 shirt was given to Cole Palmer for next season, leaving the Ukraine international without a squad number at Stamford Bridge. The positive test was returned shortly after he had been away on international duty with Ukraine in November.Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca initially said the winger was ill when asked to explain the four-game period he was absent from the team prior to the suspension being made public. Mudryk last featured in the Chelsea squad as an unused substitute for their 3-0 Premier League win against Aston Villa on December 1.His time at Chelsea has been dogged by inconsistency, with erratic performances only occasionally off-set by flashes of his ability. Mudryk has scored just 10 goals in 73 appearances in all competitions for the Blues.He made only one Premier League start last season in a win over Wolves in August.",Mykhailo Mudryk has been charged by the FA with violating anti-doping rules.

With the first Test between India and England set to commence on June 20, tensions are high and expectations over the moon in both camps. While India get ready for their first Test without legendary duo Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, England too are navigating a period of transition. With the series marking the start of a new WTC cycle (2025-2027) as well, the series truly is the start of a new era. Ahead of the series, several big names of the sport have made predictions, with votes divided among either camp.Former cricketers , including the likes of Nasser Hussain , former England batter Nick Knight , Graeme Swann, Matthew Hayden Dale Steyn and several others chipping in with their takes on who will win the five-match series. As fans remain on edge, here's a look at the predictions made by former cricketers ahead of the high-octane matchup.Former England captain Nasser Hussain has ruled out any chance of India winning the five-match Test series starting on June 20 at Headingley, Leeds. Hussain believes the Shubman Gill-led side will struggle against Ben Stokes' England.“England have a very good record at home, and India will miss the runs and experience of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli,” Hussain wrote in his column for Mail Sport. “It’s a hard one to call, but I think home advantage will swing it England’s way, and I’m going for 3-1.”Ahead of the series, Swann's comments became the subject of criticism. The 46-year-old Englishman stirred up controversy ahead of the Series, after labelling it ""the perfect warm-up' ahead of the Ashes"".“They don't have Virat Kohli or Rohit Sharma, their two superstars with the bat. Yes, they've got great players coming up instead, but we've got bowlers who exploit our conditions well. England must look to win this series. I will take 4-1, 3-2 at best. I hope we do well and get the confidence moving into the Ashes,” said the former England international.In an interaction with Timesofindia.com, the former English cricketer shared his take on which side the series will tip. The 43-year-old refused or name an outright winner, and named the ideal situation for both sides to shine.""If it’s green pitches, England might have a slight advantage. If the surfaces are flat, I think India have a great chance to win. And I suspect the ECB would want the matches to stretch into Day 4 and 5—for the spectacle of the Tendulkar-Anderson Trophy. That could work in India’s favour,"" said the former England international.The former South Africa pacer said that it will be a very close matchup, but ended up favouring the hosts in the end. ""All games will be close. But all will have a result. I think it will be 3-2 in favour of England. There will be a result in every Test match. There will be no run away win for any team, all five games will be very close,"" said Steyn on JioHotstar.The former Australian cricketer has weighed in on the upcoming series, downplaying the impact English bowlers could make. The 53-year-old said that the hosts' bowling attack is not that great', and that they have their own challenges to overcome, amidst injuries and retirements.""""I don't think England bowlers are that good, they have got a number of injuries and a number of retirees as well, that will be the challenge,"" said the veteran. ""The northern Test matches when it's zipping around that will be key, win that one and it could well be a series that goes India's way,"" added the Australian.","The five-match Test series between India and England begins on June 20.

Antonio Brown taunts legal system with jet-set lifestyle amid violent felony charges

Antonio Brown breaks silence and blames the media for twisting the story





Antonio Brown, the former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver known as much for his controversies as his football legacy, is now facing an attempted murder charge stemming from a violent altercation outside a Miami boxing event. According to an arrest warrant issued on June 11 and reported by the Associated Press, Brown allegedly retrieved a handgun during a confrontation and fired two shots at a man he previously fought with.The victim, Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu, stated one of the bullets grazed his neck. The incident occurred on May 17, and while Antonio Brown was briefly detained by police that night, he was released shortly after. The legal proceedings intensified when the warrant was made public in mid-June.Despite the serious charge, Brown is not currently in custody. Just days after the warrant’s release, the 36-year-old was spotted overseas. Initially claiming he was in Iran, Brown’s social media posts — including a photo in front of a Buka Boxing banner and a now-deleted video with a red McLaren — place him in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.Miami Police Chief Manny Morales addressed public concerns, clarifying, “We’re not going to be sending anybody there [to the Middle East].”He confirmed detectives are communicating with Brown’s attorney and expect him to be taken into custody upon his return to Florida.In a series of emotional posts on X (formerly Twitter), Brown pushed back against the accusations and the media’s portrayal of the incident. “How TF you go from being victimized unto a attempt to murder… Took a month to change the narrative,” he wrote. He also quoted Malcolm X: “The media is the most powerful entity on earth… They control the minds of the masses.”Brown claims he was the victim of an attack. “I was jumped by multiple individuals who tried to steal my jewelry… I went home that night and was not arrested,” he said.Also Read: “It was really hard”: Tom Brady opens up about Gisele Bündchen split after mocking her on TV, blames himself for their divorce While Brown remains free for now, his legal fate could shift quickly.

Inside Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld’s tropical honeymoon: First official photos spark internet swoon



After weeks of keeping fans waiting, Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen and actress-singer Hailee Steinfeld finally let the world in on their newlywed bliss. On Tuesday, Allen shared the first official photos from their tropical honeymoon, and the images radiate romance, warmth, and a sense of joy that only comes from two people madly in love.Following their lavish wedding at the picturesque San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara on May 31, the couple slipped away into privacy — something that’s become a rare luxury for two public figures of their stature. Their ceremony was filled with love and laughter, as well as familiar NFL faces, including Josh Allen’s Bills teammates and head coach Sean McDermott. While paparazzi managed to snap moments from the outdoor celebration that quickly went viral, the couple chose to keep their post-wedding life under wraps—until now.Hailee Steinfeld gave fans a subtle tease last week through her personal newsletter, Beau Society. “The next day, Josh and I ran off into the sunset to our honeymoon (more on that later?). Now we’re back, and it’s been a whole 13 days of being married, and we’ll be staying on this high forever!” she wrote, giving just a hint of their joy without revealing much.But Allen’s recent Instagram post changed that. Captioned simply “Wifey ❤️,” the MVP quarterback posted a collage featuring tropical scenes, including the couple adorned in leis — an island touch that sparked speculation about a Hawaiian getaway.While the exact location remains a mystery, fans can only imagine the paradise setting behind those beaming smiles.Hailee, on her end, complemented the narrative with her own social media tribute. She shared a collage of unseen wedding photos on June 17, cheekily captioned, “HUSBAND!” One of the images humorously teased a NSFW-looking ring shot that fans couldn’t stop talking about.In her latest newsletter entry, Steinfeld opened up more emotionally. “Over the past two weeks, random yet very specific memories have been popping back into our heads, and we’ve been blurting them out to each other, often through smiles, laughs, and tears. In no particular order, these are the moments we can’t stop thinking about.” She added, “I’m sitting here with Josh, and we’re reminiscing on the best weekend of our lives for the millionth time. ”The couple's honeymoon wasn’t just about palm trees and champagne — though there was plenty of that too. A photo revealed the newlyweds popping bubbly on a private jet, and Allen even introduced Steinfeld to one of his favorite offseason pastimes: golf. Whether she's becoming a golf fan herself remains to be seen, but the smiles suggest she’s enjoying the ride.With Josh Allen heading into the 2025 NFL season as a newly married man and Hailee balancing her booming career, the couple seems to be embracing both love and life with equal enthusiasm.

Does Caitlin Clark come from an Italian background? The Indiana Fever star has recently confirmed that she indeed has Italian roots from her mother’s side. In a candid post-game presser after the Indiana Fever vs Connecticut Sun matchup, Clark told the reporters about her Italian family background in detail.

I was like, I didn’t really get much of the Italian genes,” the Fever standout shared.Although, according to her, Clark does not have much of Italian genes in her, her brothers are an exception. “But if you look at my two brothers, they have the more darker complexion. They have a very thick, curly brown hair.I didn’t really get that.”Clark further explained, “I got my other grandmother from England, so. But yeah, I mean, I certainly have Italian roots.”She went on to detail history of her family roots in Italy. “My great grandfather owned a pub on the south side of the Des Moines, and there’s a couple pictures that my mom has and my grandfather and my grandma have, and he just like a big old Italian Man, made hamburgers like he was just like, I don’t, who knows, what else he really did, but, he was just a good guy.”On top of that, Clark admitted that he enjoys Italian food. “But yeah, Italian is also my favorite food.

Kansas City Chiefs risk sabotaging Patrick Mahomes' Super Bowl hopes by delaying $23 million Trey Smith deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/kansas-city-chiefs-risk-sabotaging-patrick-mahomes-super-bowl-hopes-by-delaying-23-million-trey-smith-deal/articleshow/121919059.cms,"Chiefs face a July 15 deadline to secure a long-term deal with offensive guard Trey Smith (Getty Images)

The franchise tag may not be enough to keep Patrick Mahomes protected for long

A long-term deal for Trey Smith could define the Chiefs’ next chapter

As the Kansas City Chiefs prepare for another high-stakes NFL season, one name looms large in the team's offseason strategy: Trey Smith . The 25-year-old offensive guard is currently playing under a non-exclusive franchise tag worth $23.4 million. While that figure ensures Smith's short-term presence, it leaves significant uncertainty for the long-term future of both the player and the franchise.The Chiefs now face a crucial July 15 deadline to negotiate a long-term deal with Smith. If they fail, he’ll play the upcoming season under the hefty one-year tag—without any guarantee of staying beyond it.Last season’s crushing 40-22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX exposed serious flaws in the Chiefs' offensive line. Despite Patrick Mahomes’ brilliance, he was constantly under siege, struggling to make plays as the Eagles’ defense dismantled the protection unit.NFL analyst Kristopher Knox from Bleacher Report didn’t mince words when he called attention to the issue. “The Kansas City Chiefs have remained in the Super Bowl picture ever since Patrick Mahomes took over as their starting quarterback. However, offensive deficiencies loomed large during Kansas City's 40-22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LIX,"" Knox wrote.""The Chiefs' offensive line was particularly problematic, as the Eagles defense consistently harassed Mahomes and shut down almost everything Kansas City did offensively. ”That performance served as a wake-up call. For the Chiefs, the message is clear: Mahomes may be the engine, but without solid protection, even the most elite quarterbacks can be neutralized.Trey Smith is not just any guard. Since entering the NFL, he’s proven to be a foundational piece of Kansas City’s offensive front. Locking him into a multi-year deal would not only provide Mahomes with a trusted protector but also reinforce the team’s commitment to offensive excellence.Knox added, “Reloading the line is this year's top offseason priority. The remaining work must start with an extension for guard Trey Smith, who is currently set to play on the franchise tag. The Chiefs have until July 15 to negotiate a long-term deal with the 25-year-old, which they have planned to do since giving him the tag.”Also Read: “Still going to fear him”: Despite lowest stats of career, Travis Kelce gets fierce support from Emmanuel Acho Fans and analysts agree—relying solely on the franchise tag could backfire.

Kelly Stafford admits weed gummies help her be a better parent to her four daughters



The Morning After with Kit Hoover

Parenting is far from picture-perfect, and no one embraces that reality more candidly than Kelly Stafford. As the wife of Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford and mom to four young daughters, Kelly has never shied away from sharing her unfiltered take on the chaos, challenges, and coping mechanisms that come with motherhood.On a recent episode of her podcast The Morning After, Kelly opened up about how weed gummies have quietly become her go-to method for handling the more stressful parenting moments. “Gummies are great. Sometimes I feel like gummies make me a better parent. They calm me down. It’s like the glass of wine,” she admitted with refreshing honesty.Kelly’s remarks were met with support from guest Kit Hoover, who called the edibles a “glass of patience”—a term Kelly immediately embraced. “Thank you for saying that,” she replied. “I feel a little guilty—and it’s not like I do it every night—but sometimes I’m like, ‘S--t it has been a long day, I don’t want to rip my hair out or their hair out so I am going to just top it off with a little gummy.’”This kind of raw, relatable confession is what has made Kelly a standout voice in the digital space. She isn’t afraid to question traditional ideas of what makes a “good mom,” stating, “As long as they’re in bed, fed and happy and feel loved, who cares how they get there? Like, just get them there.”And while she admits to occasional guilt, she’s found humor in the process. “They’re like, ‘Mommy’s nice tonight,’” she joked, noting how even her daughters notice the shift.The openness Kelly brings to her podcast goes beyond parenting hacks. She’s also discussed her past health scare involving a brain tumor, something she says ultimately strengthened her relationship with Matthew. “It was tough,” she recalled. “But I always say, it helped my marriage. It helped, just like, our family unit in a way. I’m grateful for it … and it’s because there was a good outcome.”While Kelly holds down the home front, Matthew continues to thrive on the field. The Rams quarterback recently secured a contract worth $44 million—with the potential to reach $84 million if he remains on the roster into the 2025 free agency window. With expectations high for the Rams in the upcoming season, especially after their gritty playoff run against the eventual Super Bowl champion Eagles, the Stafford household has plenty on its plate.Still, Kelly remains grounded—juggling life as a mother, podcast host, and NFL wife with a mix of humor, grace, and the occasional gummy. In a world full of filtered family portraits and Instagram-perfect parenting, her honesty is not only refreshing—it’s a breath of much-needed reality.Also Read: Gisele Bundchen gives Tom Brady a cold, silent Father’s Day while she chooses peace and passion with Joaquim Valente","Matthew Stafford’s wife says weed gummies help her be a better parent.

The’ early playoff exit has sparked speculation about major roster changes.

His expiring contract offers flexibility, making him an appealing trade target.Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk broke down the potential move: ""This is a tricky one. The Boston Celtics are known to desire shedding salary, projecting them as sellers for this offseason. Perhaps with Jayson Tatum missing due to injury, and a vacant forward spot in the starting lineup, the Celtics would view Hachimura's expiring deal as the right fit."" (H/t: Sporting News)- Reliable scoring (13.1 PPG, 50.9% FG this season)- Floor-spacing ability (41.3% from three)- Financial flexibility with his expiring contractA deal centered around Hachimura and Kristaps Porzingis could benefit both teams.Kristaps Porzingis’ upside for LA:- Three-level scoring threat- Rim protection (career 1.8 blocks per game)- Better fit alongside Anthony DavisDespite Porzingis’ injury history and poor 2025 playoffs (7.7 PPG, 31.6% FG), his skill set addresses Los Angeles Lakers’ needs.A third team might be necessary to facilitate the move.

Orphaned cheetahs named Taylor and Travis find comfort—and love—in each other

In a heartwarming twist straight out of a fairy tale, two orphaned cheetah cubs rescued from the illegal wildlife trade are making headlines—not just for surviving, but for thriving together. Named Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce , the adorable duo has formed an inseparable bond at a conservation center in Somaliland, sparkling smiles and a wild ‘Love Story’ of their own.At the Cheetah Conservation Fund's sanctuary, a heartwarming narrative of friendship and survival is playing out. It all began with a tiny cheetah cub, fittingly named Taylor Swift in a nod to the beloved popstar superstar.This resilient cub, weighing a mere three pounds upon her arrival this past April, was a lucky rescue from the clutches of the illegal wildlife pet trade. Brought to the Cheetah Rescue and Conservation Centre in Somaliland, she swiftly adapted to her secure new home, thriving under the dedicated care provided by the staff.The center recently welcomed four new residents—a litter of orphaned siblings, also saved from the same unfortunate circumstances of illegal wildlife trafficking. These new arrivals were gently introduced to Taylor Swift once they had settled into their new surroundings.Among them, a particular male cub quickly caught Taylor's attention, and a significant bond began to blossom between the two.Observing this flourishing friendship, the staff at the cheetah center made a charming and fitting decision: they named the 5-month-old male cub Travis Kelce, inspired by the well-known athlete. According to the center, this cheetah, Travis Kelce, embodies qualities similar to his namesake, described as ""playful, confident, and has a winning streak.”The delightful bond between the two cubs has not gone unnoticed. As the center's staff shared in a statement, ""Not only is [cub Taylor Swift] thriving, it looks like we have a little Love Story unfolding on the savannah."" They further emphasized the depth of the two cub's connection, stating, ""The two have become nearly inseparable—grooming each other, napping side by side, and occasionally partaking in friendly roughhousing. ""The male cub's ""rookie stats"" include an approximate sitting height of 50 cm and a length of about 90 cm, along with impressive abilities like ""climbing trees, running fast [and] scarfing down snacks."" It's clear that this young male cheetah is also ""fiercely protective of the things he likes most,"" a sentiment that undeniably includes his dear friend, Taylor Swift, the cheetah cub.Also Read: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift inspire each other to grow as Erin Andrews dubs her with sweet new nickname Isn't it amazing how these two rescued cubs found each other and formed such a special bond?

Keon Coleman ’s raw honesty and Josh Allen ’s quiet shift in tone spark fresh tension in Buffalo



Tush Push twist – Allen goes against the vote

There’s something shifting inside the Buffalo Bills locker room. A rookie receiver is holding nothing back, the franchise quarterback is keeping expectations low, and one of the NFL’s most debated plays has divided opinions. As preseason storylines unfold, Buffalo’s internal dynamics are already making waves across the league. And at the heart of it all stands Josh Allen—more vocal, more measured, and slightly at odds with his own team.Keon Coleman, the Bills' second-round draft pick, is already making headlines—not for his performance, but his brutal self-assessment. “You want to know exactly what I see? Man, that shit trash,” he said when asked about his early days. The comment, while unfiltered, reveals a raw honesty not often seen in NFL rookies. For Buffalo fans, it’s a moment that signals both humility and hunger.Josh Allen, however, is approaching Coleman’s journey with patience rather than pressure. “I wouldn’t say I expect anything out of him, but all I can say is he is 100% taking this seriously,” Allen said in a recent Sports Illustrated interview. “He’s bigger right now.He’s faster. He’s stronger. He understands the playbook better.” The Bills QB appears more focused on chemistry than instant output.Allen also praised Coleman’s willingness to improve and communicate. “We’re still conversing about how we can be better, where certain balls will be thrown,” he added. “He’s a very hungry kid, and I think that going out there and playing the way I do, I think it’ll be a very good year for him.” The message is clear: Allen sees long-term potential taking root.Off the field, Allen has taken a surprising stance on a topic that recently dominated NFL meetings—the Tush Push. Despite the Bills being among 22 teams that voted to ban the short-yardage quarterback sneak, Allen defended the tactic. “I’m a big believer in if you can’t stop it, keep running it, right?” he said, taking a stand that contradicts team management.Allen didn’t hold back on why some teams succeed while others fail with the play. “Some teams don’t practice it enough or don’t have the guys to do it,” he explained. “Just because a couple teams do it better than others, I don’t feel like it should be banned.” His comments align with Philadelphia Eagles star Jason Kelce, who helped lead the charge to preserve the play.Also read: Josh Allen’s ex Brittany Williams glows solo after NFL star’s California wedding to Hailee Steinfeld With training camp around the corner, the spotlight on the Bills only intensifies.

NFL insider names Denver Broncos as biggest threat to Chiefs’ AFC West dominance heading into 2025 season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-insider-names-denver-broncos-as-biggest-threat-to-chiefs-afc-west-dominance-heading-into-2025-season/articleshow/121921949.cms,"Broncos grit and culture fuel their ascent (Image credit: Instagram/X)

Denver Broncos’ grit and culture fuel their ascent



All eyes on Bo Nix and Denver’s defensive core







Could the Chiefs’ AFC West reign finally be in jeopardy? According to NFL insider Albert Breer, the Denver Broncos aren’t just trending upward—they might be the team best positioned to knock off Patrick Mahomes and his teammates. With fresh energy, tough practices, and a belief that’s turning heads, Denver is no longer just rebuilding—they're coming.Albert Breer, writing for Sports Illustrated, singled out the Broncos as the top threat to Kansas City’s eight-year division dominance. Despite rising expectations for the Chargers and Raiders, it’s Sean Payton’s group in Denver that’s earned the most respect this offseason. “I think the Broncos might be emerging as the Chiefs’ top threat,” Breer wrote.The confidence isn’t just about roster upgrades—it’s about culture. “I saw the gassers they ran and the two-and-a-half-hour practice they scheduled,” Breer explained. “It’s hard for me to see a group that’s bought in the way this one is to backslide.” Denver’s 10-win 2024 season wasn’t a fluke—and the league is taking notice.Sean Payton, now entering his third season with the Broncos, emphasized the team’s mentality and standards.“I think they have a high standard of how they see themselves, and where we can be,” he was quoted as saying in the Denver Post. His coaching continuity and discipline are proving to be a catalyst for belief across the roster.Key to Denver’s rise is the defense, led by Vance Joseph, which has become a physically imposing and mentally sharp unit. On offense, rookie QB Bo Nix is surrounded with talent and guidance, positioned to make a leap. With Courtland Sutton, Marvin Mims Jr., and Javonte Williams, the pieces are quietly aligning.Meanwhile, Kansas City remains the division favorite—but cracks are forming. The offense, while potent, struggled with consistency last season, and offseason departures have tightened the margin. That leaves a narrow opening for a surging Denver team hungry for a power shift in the West.Also read: Patrick Mahomes' Super Bowl shame reignites debate — Is he still the NFL’s most feared quarterback? The NFL has already circled the Broncos-Chiefs rivalry with a Christmas Day rematch set at Arrowhead. That clash could end up deciding the division—and perhaps signaling a new AFC West era. If Breer is right, the Broncos aren’t just chasing the Chiefs anymore. They’re coming for the crown.","The Denver Broncos are on the rise, according to NFL insider Albert Breer.

Tom Brady reflects on life lessons from divorce and family

Regret over Gisele Bündchen joke during Netflix roast

Tom Brady may have stepped off the NFL field, but his personal life continues to make headlines. In a recent candid conversation, the former New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback opened up about the emotional toll of his divorce from Gisele Bündchen and the unintended consequences of a joke made at her expense.Tom Brady, who now serves as a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, has gradually embraced a more reflective tone when discussing his split with Gisele Bündchen. “Not everyone is perfect,” he said during a recent interview, emphasizing that many people aren’t equipped early in life to manage the complexities of family. “It's all about having a clear purpose in life and improving little by little,” he added.That introspective approach comes in the wake of years of scrutiny over his marriage and career choices—especially his decision to return to football in 2020 after briefly retiring. That move, which saw him join the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, reignited questions about his priorities.“She didn't feel like I was doing my part for the family. She thought I'd play the whole season, and she'd take care of the house,” Tom Brady admitted, acknowledging the imbalance that may have led to growing tension at home.One moment that clearly still weighs on Tom Brady is his participation in The Roast of Tom Brady on Netflix.While the quarterback appeared to take the jokes in stride during the show, including a jab from comedian Nikki Glaser—“You have seven rings... well, eight now that Gisele gave hers back”—Brady has since revealed the aftermath wasn’t so humorous for his family.“It was hard for my kids, for sure... You don't know what to expect, and I love to laugh at myself... but for my kids, it was really hard,” Brady said in a May appearance on the Impaulsive podcast.Brady has long admitted that his devotion to football shaped every decision in his adult life. “I always felt that way when I stepped onto the field. So many people dedicated their time and energy to me and our team, and I never wanted to let them down,” he said. That mindset, however, may have come at a personal cost—a truth Brady now seems ready to accept as he enters a new chapter post-retirement.Also Read: Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bündchen’s secret plastic surgery strategy in Paris sparked cultural backlash and personal regret In February, the Bündchen welcomed a new baby boy with her boyfriend of nearly two years, Joaquim Valente.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has threatened to withdraw from their upcoming Asia Cup 2025 Group A match against the United Arab Emirates if the International Cricket Council (ICC) does not remove match referee Andy Pycroft from the tournament. This development follows a controversy where the Indian cricket team refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts after their match on Sunday.And as TimesofIndia.com reported on Monday, ICC are unlikely to pay heed to PCB's threats and have all but made their stance on the situation clear.The incident occurred during the post-match proceedings when India captain Suryakumar Yadav and his team declined the customary handshake with their Pakistani opponents. The Indian team also closed their dressing room door, preventing the traditional exchange of greetings.Pakistan's captain Salman Agha and coach Mike Hesson expressed their displeasure with the Indian team's actions. Agha subsequently boycotted the post-match presentation, choosing not to interact with former Indian cricket player Sanjay Manjrekar.The PCB's threat to withdraw from their match against the UAE carries significant consequences. If Pakistan follows through with their boycott, they would be automatically eliminated from the Asia Cup tournament.A boycott would result in Pakistan being stranded with only two points from their single victory against Oman.This would be insufficient for qualification to the Super 4s stage, as both India and the UAE would then accumulate more points.India, however, have already qualified for the next stage of the competition, after UAE beat Oman by 42 runs at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi.India lead the Group A standings with four points from two matches with Pakistan second on two points. UAE joined them on two points after Monday's fixture but have a far inferior net run rate. However, if Pakistan boycott their match, the UAE would receive a walkover, increasing their points to four. Oman, meanwhile, have been eliminated from the competition.This scenario would ensure both India and the UAE's progression to the Super 4s stage. India have already secured four points from their victories against the UAE and Pakistan.If Pakistan do continue with their match against the UAE, it would become a decisive contest where the winner advances to the next round.

India’s Handshake Snub at Asia Cup Leaves Pakistan in Full Meltdown, ICC Dragged Into Drama

NEW DELHI: After a turbulent few days dominated by the handshake controversy and threats from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to pull out of the tournament, India are switching their focus back to cricket. The team is scheduled to resume training in Dubai on Tuesday, arriving at the ICC Academy around 5:40 PM local time (7:10 PM IST), with practice set to begin at 6:00 PM (7:30 PM IST).The drama off the field hasn’t derailed India’s on-field campaign. In fact, they have become the first team to qualify for the Super 4 stage of the Asia Cup 2025. Their progression was sealed after the United Arab Emirates (UAE) comprehensively defeated Oman to register their first win of the tournament.Powered by fluent half-centuries from both openers, the UAE posted a commanding 172/5. Their bowlers then ripped through Oman’s top order, grabbing four wickets inside the PowerPlay to leave the chase in ruins. Paceman Junaid Siddique starred with the ball as Oman never found momentum and eventually crashed out of the competition.This result confirmed India’s place in the Super 4s, even before they play their final group-stage match.Having already beaten both the UAE and arch-rivals Pakistan, India sit comfortably atop Group A with a commanding net run rate.With Oman’s exit and India’s progression secure, the upcoming India-Oman clash is now a dead rubber.However, the stakes remain high elsewhere. The UAE will next face Pakistan in what is effectively a virtual knockout. The winner will join India in the Super 4 stage, while the loser will bow out.Pakistan, reeling from their seven-wicket defeat to India, face a do-or-die scenario. Their path to the Super 4 depends entirely on beating the UAE.Complicating matters further is the PCB’s standoff with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over match referee Andy Pycroft, whom they accuse of breaching Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) Spirit of Cricket protocols during the now-infamous handshake row. The PCB has even threatened to withdraw from the tournament if Pycroft is not removed.If the ICC rejects the PCB’s demand and Pakistan boycott their match against the UAE on Wednesday, they will be eliminated at the league stage, handing the UAE a walkover into the Super 4s.",India are set to resume training in Dubai on Tuesday. The team has been distracted by the handshake controversy. India are the first team to qualify for the Super 4 stage of the Asia Cup 2025.

TimesofIndia.com in Dubai:

Handshake drama becomes ugly! India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2025 in DANGER?

The International Cricket Council (ICC) is likely to reject Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB)'s demand for a change of match referee Andy Pycroft for remainder of the Asia Cup. ICC's response to PCB's letter, addressed to the global cricket body's General Manager Wasim Khan, is in the works and could be sent anytime now.PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the President of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), wanted the immediate removal of match referee Pycroft. PCB had alleged that Pycroft requested the captains not to shake hands at the toss.The handshakes didn't happen, both at the toss and after the game, and there has been no dearth of drama since.It is reliably understood that Pycroft could well have been following instructions from someone in the ACC, as ICC's job ends after they appoint the officials in consultation with the organising body.""What has ICC got to do with it? Their role ends when the officials are appointed. Someone from the ACC had a chat with Pycroft before the game, and what happened at the toss was a result of that chat. It’s about time the PCB chief finds out what that chat was, who did it and why—instead of pointing fingers at the ICC to further fuel the fire,"" says a source tracking developments.TimesofIndia.com reached out to the ICC for a comment on the development, but got no response from the global cricket body.It now remains to be seen what PCB do next after ICC's response, as they had threatened to pull out of the tournament if their demand for Pycroft's removal was not met. With that unlikely to happen, will the Pakistan cricket team not participate in the remainder of the tournament—a tournament organised by a body chaired by the PCB chief?""All this talk and posting on social media is good for the optics and narrative back home, but it makes very little sense. If they had a problem with India not shaking hands, even that’s not mandatory,"" adds the source.India and Pakistan are scheduled to train at the ICC Academy on September 16, and while the time slots are different, the two sides will be at the same venue for some time together. India have already qualified for the next stage in the competition but Pakistan's place, given the current threat and limbo, remains unclear.","PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the President of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), wanted the immediate removal of match referee Pycroft.

Asia Cup: Pathum Nissanka’s 68 powers Sri Lanka to tense 4-wicket win over Hong Kong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/asia-cup/asia-cup-pathum-nissankas-68-powers-sri-lanka-to-tense-4-wicket-win-over-hong-kong/articleshow/123906956.cms,"Hong Kong vs Sri Lanka (Photo by Francois Nel/Getty Images)

Pathum Nissanka scored 68 runs off 44 balls as Sri Lanka secured a four-wicket victory against Hong Kong in the Asia Cup Group B match. The win came despite a challenging chase at the venue on Monday.Nissanka's innings was marked by strategic acceleration, and his partnership with Kusal Perera (20) yielded 57 runs for the third wicket. This partnership brought Sri Lanka closer to qualifying for the Super 4 stage.Sri Lanka achieved the target of 150 runs, finishing at 153 for six in 18.5 overs. The team adopted a cautious approach initially on the slow pitch before increasing their scoring rate after the 10-over mark.The Sri Lankan team lost Kusal Mendis and Kamil Mishara early, reaching 65 runs in the first 10 overs. Nissanka, who was dropped twice during his innings at scores of 40 and 60, capitalized on these opportunities.Nissanka focused on scoring runs through calculated shots rather than aggressive hitting. He targeted the shorter square leg boundary, including a swept six against medium-pacer Aizaz Khan.Sri Lanka's scoring rate improved significantly as they added 42 runs in three overs after the 10-over mark, with Nissanka and Perera leading the charge.Hong Kong managed to create pressure by taking four quick wickets. They dismissed Nissanka, Perera, Kamindu Mendis, and captain Charith Asalanka in quick succession, reducing Sri Lanka from 119 for two to 127 for six.Wanindu Hasaranga's unbeaten 20 runs off 9 balls helped Sri Lanka secure the victory and keep their Super 4 hopes alive in the tournament.In the first innings, Hong Kong posted a competitive total of 149 for four. Nizakat Khan remained unbeaten on 52 off 38 balls, while Anshuman Rath contributed 48 runs from 46 balls.The highlight of Hong Kong's innings was a 61-run partnership between Rath and Nizakat for the third wicket. Both batsmen played well against Sri Lanka's experienced bowling attack.Rath's innings featured shots on both sides of the wicket, including an impressive inside-out cover drive against spinner Asalanka. Nizakat, who became Hong Kong's second player to score a T20 Asia Cup fifty, focused on straight-field scoring.Nizakat benefited from two fortunate incidents in the 17th over. He was dropped by wicketkeeper Kusal Mendis and survived a catch due to a no-ball by Thilan Thushara.Rath's innings ended when he was caught by Kamindu off Dushmantha Chameera, who finished with figures of 2/29.Hong Kong started strongly, scoring 38 runs in the first four overs, thanks to Zeeshan Ali's quick 23 runs off 17 balls.Chameera dismissed Ali, caught behind by Kusal Mendis, which slowed Hong Kong's momentum. Hasaranga then removed Babar Hayat, further restricting Hong Kong's scoring rate.",Sri Lanka beat Hong Kong by four wickets in Asia Cup Group B match.

No handshakes

A few days ago, R Ashwin cheekily suggested that South Africa be thrown into the Asia Cup mix and the event be rechristened the Afro-Asia Cup, just to inject some real competition. After Sunday, he may have had a point.On Sunday, under the sweltering Dubai heat, the so-called ""arch-rivalry"", once again, felt like a damp squib.The only real drama came when India captain Suryakumar Yadav refused the customary handshake at the toss with his counterpart Salman Ali Agha. Beyond that, Pakistan barely showed up, reduced to mere spectators in what was once cricket’s fiercest duel.After opting to bat first, Pakistan batters looked rattled against pace and were all at sea against India's quality spinners. Shaheen Afridi’s unbeaten 33 off 16 balls, laced with four sixes—including a brutal assault on Hardik Pandya in the final over — dragged Pakistan to 127/9. India won the match comprehensively by seven wickets.India, with Suryakumar Yadav and Shivam Dube in the middle, marched back to their dressing room the moment the game ended.The Indian pairing exchanged handshakes with teammates in the dugout, before the entire squad disappeared upstairs. The door shut firmly, echoing Suryakumar Yadav’s snub at the toss, as the Indian cricket team once again refused to shake hands with Pakistan.Caught in the middle, Salman Ali Agha’s men stopped mid-way after head coach Mike Hesson ordered them towards their dressing room. But not a single Indian player emerged. A visibly miffed Hesson then stormed to India’s dressing room, found no response, and was later spotted in a heated discussion with match referee Andy Pycroft.Later, SKY dedicated the win to the armed forces and expressed solidarity with the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack. ""We stand by the victims of the families of the Pahalgam terror attack. We express our solidarity. Want to dedicate the win to all our armed forces who showed a lot of bravery,"" he said in the post-match press conference.Hardik Pandya struck off the very first legal delivery of the match, sending Saim Ayub packing for his second golden duck in a row. Jasprit Bumrah then removed Pakistan’s recent hero Mohammad Haris, thanks to a sharp catch from Hardik Pandya.Thereafter, there was some spunk shown by Sahibzada Farhan (40 off 44; 1x4, 3x6), who has replaced Babar Azam in the team. He briefly resisted with a couple of sixes off Bumrah.The battle between Sahibzada Farhan and Jasprit Bumrah was fascinating. Pakistan's highest run-getter of the match tonked Bumrah over mid-on for a six.A ball later, there was a change in field. Shubman Gill walked to short mid-wicket from the only slip, and Bumrah tried an attempted yorker. The low full toss took Farhan by surprise and it nearly carried to Bumrah in the follow-through, but despite his full-stretched dive, it fell short.For the second match in a row, Bumrah bowled three overs on the trot in the powerplay. This time, Farhan dispatched him into the second tier. It was angling into the body, and the Pakistani opener swivelled his blade, got wood, and became only the sixth batter to hit multiple sixes off Bumrah in T20Is. To add to that, he also became the first Pakistan batter to hit a six off Bumrah's bowling in this format.Next ball, Farhan tried another maximum but ended up miscuing it and it fell in no man's land.Farhan added 39 runs while Fakhar Zaman, whose cameo ended at 17, was dismissed by Axar Patel.After that, India’s spinners tore through Pakistan’s middle order.Axar’s twin blows and Kuldeep’s double-strike ripped through Pakistan’s innings, choking their scoring despite desperate aggression. At one stage even 100 looked out of reach, before Shaheen’s late fireworks lifted them to something to fight with.Kuldeep Yadav (3/18) was once again India’s trump card, with Axar (2/18), Bumrah (2/28), Varun (1/24) and Pandya (1/34) ensuring Pakistan never settled.Abhishek Sharma started the chase in a way he always does. He made Shaheen Shah Afridi look like a club bowler—hitting a four and a six in the first two balls of the innings. He gave Shaheen the same treatment in his second spell, hammering him for a four and a maximum.Abhishek looked in a hurry, clattering Saim Ayub for back-to-back boundaries. With him at the crease, it looked like India would chase it down inside ten overs.But Saim Ayub, who is failing miserably with the bat, removed both Indian openers.Shubman Gill was deceived by a carrom ball. After being hit for two boundaries, Ayub bowled the ball of the match. The carrom ball dipped on off stump, Gill pressed forward but it turned away, beating the outside edge. Haris whipped off the bails in a flash. Saim then sent back Abhishek with a slower off-break, caught at long-off by Faheem Ashraf. Abhishek scored a quickfire 13-ball 31.Tilak Varma (31 off 31b; 2x4, 1x6) and Suryakumar Yadav (47 not out off 37 balls) put on a steady run-a-ball 56-run partnership for the third wicket to knock Pakistan out of the game.The duo looked at ease, rotated strike, hit a few audacious shots, and managed to keep Pakistan at bay.It was Saim Ayub who finally broke the partnership with another ripper. A quicker off-break on middle drifted in, pitched, and turned sharply. Tilak went back to defend but was beaten by the spin as the ball crashed into the off-stump. Saim Ayub had his third, while Tilak stood surprised at where it had pitched.Saim Ayub (3/35) was the pick of the Pakistan bowlers.Suryakumar Yadav sealed the match with a six, with 25 balls to spare, as India chased down the total comfortably.Overall, it was a nothing performance from Pakistan, and it looked like a mismatch competition both on paper and on the field.","India beat Pakistan by seven wickets in T20 match in Dubai.

Suryakumar Yadav on no handshake with Pakistan: 'Some things in life are ahead of sportsmanship'

NEW DELHI: India cruised to a commanding seven-wicket win over Pakistan in their Asia Cup clash, chasing down a 128-run target in just 15.5 overs. Skipper Suryakumar Yadav anchored the chase with an unbeaten 47 off 37 balls, while left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav starred with the ball, picking 3/18 to earn the Player of the Match award.Fans of Team India erupted in celebrations after the win, brimming with confidence in the side’s all-round performance.“Pakistan should have practised a little more, bachey the bachey hi reh gye (kids stayed the same). They won the toss and batted first. It was a spinning track and chasing was easier. That is where Pakistan made a mistake,” said one fan.“A lot of missed catches, they could have stopped some boundaries. Indian batting was good... I think it was an overall team effort by Team India. Abhishek Sharma was really good. I came here from the USA,” said another cricket enthusiast.Put in to bat first, Pakistan collapsed early to 6/2. A 39-run stand between Sahibzada Farhan (40) and Fakhar Zaman (17) offered brief resistance, but regular strikes left them reeling at 97/8. A late flourish from Shaheen Shah Afridi (33*), however, helped them push to 127/9 in their 20 overs.India’s bowlers delivered a clinical performance — Kuldeep bagged three wickets, while Axar Patel and Jasprit Bumrah took two each, and Hardik Pandya chipped in with one.Chasing 128, India lost two early wickets, but Abhishek Sharma’s blistering 31 off 13 balls gave them momentum. A composed 56-run stand between Suryakumar and Tilak Varma (31) steadied the innings, before Suryakumar and Shivam Dube (10*) finished the job with 25 balls to spare.The win propelled India to the top of Group A, with two wins from as many matches.","India cruised to a commanding seven-wicket win over Pakistan in Asia Cup clash.

Suryakumar Yadav on no handshake with Pakistan: 'Some things in life are ahead of sportsmanship'

Poll Do you think India's refusal to shake hands with Pakistan players was justified? Yes, it was a political statement No, it was against sportsmanship It's complicated, context matters

NEW DELHI: There is plenty of noise about India refusing to shake hands with Pakistan players after their Asia Cup 2025 Group A match in Dubai on Sunday — and rightly so. The customary handshake was expected, but never came. What slipped under the radar, however, was the fact that India’s players also denied handshakes to the match officials, hurrying straight into their dressing room and locking the door behind them.The dramatic scenes unfolded after India’s commanding seven-wicket victory over their arch-rivals at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. Captain Suryakumar Yadav finished the chase in style with a towering six, but instead of walking across to greet his opponents or officials, he shook hands only with batting partner Shivam Dube before leading his men briskly off the field. Within seconds, India’s support staff shut the dressing room door, leaving Pakistan’s players stranded in the middle and match referee Andy Pycroft looking on in confusion.The snub sparked instant outrage. Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha staged a silent protest by skipping the post-match presentation ceremony altogether. Head coach Mike Hesson later voiced his frustration at the media briefing: “We were ready to shake hands at the end of the game.We are disappointed that the opposition did not do that. We went over there and they were already gone to the changing room. That was obviously a disappointing way to finish the match. ”Visibly upset, Hesson even rushed towards India’s dressing room, only to find the doors bolted. He was later seen in a tense discussion with match referee Pycroft. Broadcasters were forced into an awkward reshuffle as the Pakistan captain’s absence left the official post-match ceremony incomplete.Pakistan’s management issued a strongly worded statement soon after: “The behaviour of Indian players was against the spirit of sportsmanship. That is why skipper Salman Agha was not sent to the post-match ceremony.”India, meanwhile, stood their ground. At the press conference, Suryakumar Yadav defended the move, framing it as a political and emotional decision.“The team was aligned with the government and the Board of Control for Cricket in India in not shaking hands with the Pakistan team. We stand with the victims and families of the Pahalgam terror attack and dedicate today’s win to the armed forces.”The encounter, the first between the two nations since a deadly military conflict in May that left more than 70 people dead, was always bound to carry political undertones. The April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam — which New Delhi blamed on Pakistan — continues to cast a shadow over cricketing ties.While India’s comfortable victory on the field was never in doubt, it is the post-match drama — the refusal to acknowledge not only Pakistan’s players but even the match officials — that has now become the defining talking point of the Asia Cup clash.","India refused to shake hands with Pakistan players after their Asia Cup 2025 Group A match in Dubai on Sunday.

Match ko political na banao

The handshake row between India and Pakistan has taken yet another fiery turn, with former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif urging his country’s cricket board to lodge an official complaint. In an explosive reaction, Latif said India’s stance at the Asia Cup match in Dubai left “a wrong impression” and brought politics onto the field.“Wars have happened before too, but we have always shaken hands. These things will remain a blot for a lifetime,” Latif toldin an exclusive interview from Karachi.“In his interviews, Sunil Gavaskar talks about Javed Miandad, but he never says they didn’t shake hands. We represent our countries, but I personally think what happened was not right.”India defeated Pakistan by seven wickets in the Asia Cup on Sunday with 25 balls remaining.The match proceeded despite calls for a boycott after 26 Indian tourists were killed in the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, with India later conducting Operation Sindoor against terrorist bases across the border.The tension was evident from the start when captains Suryakumar Yadav and Salman Ali Agha avoided the traditional handshake during the toss, submitting their team sheets to match referee Andy Pycroft without making eye contact.After sealing victory with a six, Suryakumar immediately turned toward the dugout, ignoring the Pakistani players who had lined up for handshakes.Latif, the former Pakistan captain, further intensified his criticism by linking the incident to the recent Pahalgam terror attack.“Your reservations in terms of war or the Pahalgam attack are legitimate. But when you come to the ground, play the sport the right way. If Pakistan is involved in the Pahalgam attack, then catch those who are responsible.‘Jung hi kar lete, woh bhi nahi ki puri tarah se’ (India should have fought the war, but they didn’t even do that properly). India should have fought the war, they should not have backed out,” he said.The former wicketkeeper-batter didn’t hold back in accusing India of hiding behind politics. “To hide their own mistakes, a lot of things are being done politically. What happened on the ground was not correct,” he said, adding that he personally “did not like it” and that the Indian team “left a wrong impression.”Meanwhile, former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar echoed the sentiments and asked the Indian cricket team to show grace while also praising their performance.(Don’t bring politics into sports),” he said on PTV Sports.“Hats off to India, well done. We are talking good things about you, but we can say things also. Show your grace, do the handshakes. Fights happen in every house, but that doesn’t mean you take it to the next level,” Akhtar said in a strong message.With India’s seven-wicket win already overshadowed by “handshake-gate,” the fallout may well spill over if the two sides meet again in the Super Four stage.",Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif urges his country's cricket board to lodge an official complaint.

The Pakistan team management has lodged a protest, calling the behaviour against the spirit of sports,"" the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said in a statement.""Salman Ali Agha skipped the post-match presentation in protest against the behaviour of the Indian team, as the ceremony host was also an Indian.""Suryakumar Yadav dedicated Sunday’s emphatic seven-wicket win over Pakistan to the armed forces, expressing solidarity with the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack as India outclassed their neighbours in a completely one-sided contest to underline their dominance in the Asia Cup clash.“Perfect occasion, taking the time out, we stand by the victims and families of the Pahalgam terror attack. We express our solidarity.I want to dedicate the win to all our armed forces who showed a lot of bravery. I hope they continue to inspire us all and we give them more reasons on the ground whenever we get an opportunity to put a smile on their face,” he said at the post-match presentation.Unusual scenes unfolded at the end of the match after Suryakumar sealed the win with a six, shook hands only with batting partner Shivam Dube, and walked off without acknowledging the Pakistani players.A similar moment occurred at the toss, when Suryakumar and Salman Ali Agha skipped the customary handshake. Even broadcaster Ravi Shastri, who conducted the toss, did not exchange pleasantries with Agha.At the post-match press conference, Suryakumar said: “I think that was our proper reply. Our government and the BCCI were aligned, and together we took a call. We came here only to play cricket.”He added: “I feel a few things in life are ahead of sportsmanship. I said at the presentation as well that we stand with all the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack. And we stand with their families too, expressing our solidarity.""Also, as I said at the post-match presentation, we dedicate this win to our brave armed forces who took part in Operation Sindoor. And as they continue to inspire us all, we will try our best, whenever given an opportunity, to inspire them as well, if possible.”Pakistan coach Mike Hesson confirmed Salman Ali Agha’s absence from the presentation was a reaction to India’s stance.“I think it's just the flow-on effect of the fact that we were obviously keen to engage and shake hands at the end of the match. That didn't happen. That was pretty much the end of it,” Hesson said.“Obviously, we were ready to shake hands at the end of the game. We were disappointed that our opposition didn't do that. We sort of went over there to shake hands and they were already going to the changing room. That was a disappointing way for the match to end. In a match where we were already disappointed with the way we played, we were at least willing to go and shake hands.”",India captain Suryakumar Yadav and Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha did not shake hands at the end of the Asia Cup match in Dubai.

Suryakumar Yadav on no handshake with Pakistan: 'Some things in life are ahead of sportsmanship'

NEW DELHI: India’s emphatic seven-wicket win over Pakistan in the Asia Cup on Sunday quickly turned into a political and sporting flashpoint after an extraordinary post-match episode that is already being dubbed ""handshake-gate. ""As soon as India skipper Suryakumar Yadav hit the winning six to finish the game, he walked towards batting partner Shivam Dube, shook his hand, and then walked off to their dressing room without waiting for the opposing players.As per cricketing tradition, players usually shake hands after the final ball. But at the Dubai International Stadium, India’s support staff shut the dressing room door while Pakistan’s players waited on the field, leaving their rivals without the customary gesture of sportsmanship.Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson described the moment as “disappointing.” He told reporters: “We were ready to shake hands at the end of the game. We are disappointed that the opposition did not do that. We went over there and they were already gone to the changing room, so that was obviously a disappointing way to finish the match.”The Pakistan team stood for a couple of minutes before heading back, only to see their coach race towards India’s changing room — but by then the doors were locked.A visibly frustrated Hesson held a long discussion with match referee Andy Pycroft before walking back towards the pitch. Pakistan’s captain Salman Ali Agha even skipped the post-match presentation in protest, with the team later issuing a statement alleging that “the behaviour of Indian players was against the spirit of sportsmanship. ”India, however, remained defiant. Suryakumar defended the decision, saying: “The team were aligned with the government and Board of Control for Cricket in India in not shaking hands with the Pakistan team. We stand with the victims and families of the Pahalgam terror attack and we express our solidarity. We want to dedicate today’s win to the armed forces.”Head coach Gautam Gambhir also backed the team’s stance in a broadcast interview, praising the players’ resolve. “The match was important for us because as a team we wanted to show our solidarity to the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack. More importantly, we want to thank our armed forces for their successful Operation Sindoor,” Gambhir said.The fiery exchange overshadowed what had been a one-sided contest on the field, with India’s spinners and top order dominating Pakistan. But by Monday morning, it was not Kuldeep Yadav’s 3-18 or Suryakumar’s unbeaten 47 that trended online — it was the image of Pakistan players waiting for a handshake that never came, as India chose symbolism over ceremony.",India beat Pakistan by seven wickets in the Asia Cup on Sunday.

Suryakumar Yadav statement on Pahalgam to handshake drama: How India HUMILIATED Pakistan

One down, two to go

Hostilities beyond the boundary

On-field action

NEW DELHI: India vs Pakistan under such a hostile climate — ranging from boycott calls to the post-match handshake snub — has already turned the Asia Cup 2025 into a politically charged and volatile spectacle.But the drama in the UAE may only be beginning. The tournament format leaves open the tantalising possibility of not one, but two more high-voltage India–Pakistan clashes before the month is out.India’s seven-wicket win over Pakistan on Sunday at the Dubai International Stadium virtually secured their place in the Super Four stage. As Group A toppers (A1), India are expected to march into the next round.For Pakistan, the equation is straightforward: beat hosts UAE in their final group game, and they qualify as A2. That scenario would set up a second India–Pakistan face-off in the Super Four next Sunday, September 21.And if both sides hold their nerve and make it to the final, cricket’s fiercest rivals would be staring at a third clash on September 28, making this Asia Cup a potential trilogy of tension-filled encounters.The first clash was marred not just by India’s dominance on the field but by simmering hostility off it. India’s players refused the customary handshakes with their Pakistani counterparts — and even with match officials — before hurrying into the dressing room and shutting the door.India captain Suryakumar Yadav defended the move, stressing that the team was aligned with the BCCI and government. “We stand with the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack and we express our solidarity. Today’s win is dedicated to the armed forces,” he said.Pakistan, however, lodged a formal protest with match referee Andy Pycroft. Head coach Mike Hesson called the episode “disappointing,” while skipper Salman Ali Agha boycotted the post-match presentation in protest.On the pitch, India’s bowlers set the tone as Hardik Pandya , Jasprit Bumrah, Axar Patel, and Kuldeep Yadav combined to restrict Pakistan to 127/9. Shaheen Afridi’s late fireworks (33* off 16) ensured a respectable finish, but India chased the target in just 15.5 overs. Abhishek Sharma’s fiery 31 and Suryakumar’s unbeaten 47 sealed the deal, with the skipper finishing the match on his 35th birthday with a towering six.With the Super Four looming and the potential final on the horizon, the Asia Cup 2025 could yet deliver two more chapters in the most politically loaded rivalry in world cricket.","India beat Pakistan by seven wickets in the Asia Cup in Dubai.

NEW DELHI: Skipper Muhammad Waseem and Alishan Sharafu hammered brisk half-centuries before a fine 4/23 spell from Junaid Siddique as United Arab Emirates (UAE) thrashed Oman by 42 runs to keep their Asia Cup Super Four hopes alive on Monday.Waseem anchored the innings with a 69 off 54 balls, falling only in the final over, while opening partner Sharafu shook off a scratchy start to blaze 51 from 38 balls. Their 94-run stand powered UAE to 172/5 after being sent in.The total proved well beyond Oman’s reach as they folded for 130 in 18.4 overs. A win over Pakistan on Wednesday could now take UAE into the next stage, provided India beat Oman in the final group game.Siddique struck early, removing openers Aamir Kaleem (2) and skipper Jatinder Singh (20) with just 23 on the board. Left-arm spinner Haider Ali (2/22) deepened the collapse as Oman slumped to 50/5 inside seven overs.Aryan Bisht and Vinayak Shukla briefly revived the chase, taking the score to 74/5, but Bisht’s 38-run stand with Shukla ended when he was bowled by left-arm pacer Muhammad Jawadullah (2/18) while attempting an inside-out shot.Jawadullah also dismissed Jiten Ramanandi (13) before Siddique returned to clean up the tail.Earlier, Ramanandi (2/24) was the pick of Oman’s bowlers after Waseem and Sharafu’s onslaught. Sharafu kickstarted the innings with crisp boundaries through the off-side off Shah Faisal and later struck three successive fours off Hassnain Shah.Waseem joined the charge with three boundaries in Kaleem’s first over as UAE raced to 50 in the powerplay. The duo added sixes off Samay Shrivastava and received reprieves when Hammad Mirza and Shakeel Ahmed dropped catches, helping UAE reach 83/0 at the halfway mark.Sharafu eventually fell to Ramanandi, bowled while attempting another off-side hit. Both teams had lost their opening matches to Pakistan and India respectively, making this a must-win clash for UAE—and they delivered in style.","United Arab Emirates (UAE) thrash Oman by 42 runs to keep their Asia Cup Super Four hopes alive.

India’s Handshake Snub at Asia Cup Leaves Pakistan in Full Meltdown, ICC Dragged Into Drama

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing handshake controversy and threats from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to pull out of the tournament, India have officially become the first team to qualify for the Super 4 stage of the Asia Cup 2025. The development came after United Arab Emirates outplayed neighbours Oman to pick up their first win of the competition.Riding on fluent half-centuries from both openers, the UAE posted a strong 172/5 on the board. Their bowlers then ripped through Oman’s top order, striking four times inside the PowerPlay to leave the chase in tatters.Paceman Junaid Siddique starred with the ball as Oman never found momentum and crashed out of the tournament.This result confirmed India’s berth in the Super 4s, even before they play their final group-stage match.Having already beaten both the UAE and arch-rivals Pakistan in their opening fixtures, India sit comfortably on top of Group A with a huge net run rate advantage.With Oman’s exit and India’s progression sealed, the upcoming India-Oman clash now stands as a dead rubber.However, the stakes remain high elsewhere — the UAE will next face Pakistan in what is now effectively a knockout match.The winner will join India in the Super 4 stage, while the loser will bow out.Pakistan, who suffered a seven-wicket defeat to India, now face a do-or-die scenario. Their path to the Super 4 depends entirely on beating the UAE.But adding to the tension is the PCB’s ongoing standoff with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over match referee Andy Pycroft, whom they have accused of violating the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) Spirit of Cricket protocols in the recent handshake row.The PCB has threatened to withdraw from the tournament if Pycroft is not removed.If the ICC rejects the PCB’s demand and Pakistan boycott their match against the UAE on Wednesday, they will be eliminated from the competition at the league stage itself, as the UAE would advance with two wins compared to Pakistan’s one.",India have officially become the first team to qualify for the Super 4 stage of the Asia Cup 2025.

India’s Handshake Snub at Asia Cup Leaves Pakistan in Full Meltdown, ICC Dragged Into Drama

NEW DELHI: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi has threatened to withdraw from the remaining Asia Cup 2025 matches if match referee Andy Pycroft is not removed, following a controversy over missing handshakes during the India–Pakistan clash in Dubai on Sunday. The PCB has filed a formal complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC), accusing Pycroft of violating the ICC Code of Conduct and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) Laws regarding the Spirit of Cricket.The controversy erupted when Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha and India skipper Suryakumar Yadav did not exchange the customary handshake during the toss at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. The PCB alleges Pycroft had specifically instructed Salman to avoid shaking hands with his Indian counterpart.“The PCB has lodged a complaint with the ICC regarding violations by the Match Referee of the ICC Code of Conduct and the MCC Laws pertaining to the Spirit of Cricket. The PCB has demanded an immediate removal of the Match Referee from the Asia Cup,” Naqvi posted on X.The situation escalated after India’s seven-wicket win when Suryakumar shook hands only with teammate Shivam Dube and walked off without acknowledging the Pakistani players.Pakistan coach Mike Hesson voiced his disappointment:“Obviously, we were ready to shake hands at the end of the game. We were disappointed that our opposition didn't do that. We went over there to shake hands and they were already going to the changing room.

We express our solidarity. I want to dedicate the win to all our armed forces who showed a lot of bravery… I feel a few things in life are ahead of sportsmanship.”He also referred to Operation Sindoor while dedicating the win to India’s armed forces.The PCB’s complaint has reached the ICC headquarters, chaired by Jay Shah, further straining ties between the two boards. Pycroft is scheduled to officiate Pakistan’s next match against United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Wednesday, which the PCB says strengthens its case.“There is nothing more important to me than the honour and prestige of my country,” Naqvi posted later.India have virtually secured a Super Four spot with two wins, while Pakistan must beat UAE to stay alive.

Why handshakes matter in cricket — rules and protocols explained

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has escalated tensions with India by demanding the removal of match referee Andy Pycroft following a controversial handshake refusal by Indian players after their Asia Cup clash on Sunday. The incident occurred after India’s seven-wicket victory, when the team declined to shake hands with Pakistani players in solidarity with the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack.The PCB has taken the matter to both the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) and the International Cricket Council (ICC), alleging that Pycroft violated ICC conduct codes and the spirit of cricket.Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav defended his team’s actions, referencing the Pahalgam attack in which 26 people were killed by Pakistan-backed terrorists. The Indian side had already faced criticism for playing against Pakistan.According to the PCB, Pycroft allegedly instructed Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with his Indian counterpart during the toss.“The PCB has lodged a complaint with the ICC regarding violations by the Match Referee of the ICC Code of Conduct and the MCC Laws pertaining to the Spirit of Cricket. The PCB has demanded an immediate removal of the Match Referee from the Asia Cup,” PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi posted on X.The situation is further complicated by cricket governance structures: Mohsin Naqvi currently heads the ACC, while India’s Jay Shah leads the ICC. However, the Asia Cup operates under ACC jurisdiction rather than ICC control.By tradition, the two on-field players of the team batting second shake hands with the fielding side and the umpires before walking off.Similarly, the batting team enters the ground to shake hands with opponents, a practice now common in all international matches. Handshakes provide a formal way for teams to end the match on a friendly note and exchange words of encouragement.Before the toss, both captains also shake hands, which is conducted by the match referee on the pitch, often broadcast live.Captains and the referee may also discuss team lineups or other matters of mutual interest.Additionally, the match referee can meet with a captain, head coach, or team manager prior to the match.",Pakistan Cricket Board demands removal of match referee Andy Pycroft.

Cricket’s shortest format is undergoing a breathtaking transformation, evolving from a format of calculated risks to a high-octane battle where colossal totals of 250+ and even 300+ are no longer outliers but plausible targets. The 2026 T20 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, is set to amplify this trend, with India’s strategy of building a batting line-up that extends to No. 8 reflecting the game’s relentless pursuit of runs at a frenetic pace.This approach, evident in India’s team selections over time, including the ongoing Asia Cup in the UAE, where power-hitter Shivam Dube secures a spot in the XI while specialist bowler Arshdeep Singh often warms the bench, underscores their intent to prioritise batting depth to match the global scoring surge.Venues like Mumbai’s Wankhede, Bengaluru’s Chinnaswamy, and Colombo’s Premadasa, with their short boundaries and batting-friendly surfaces, will likely fuel this run-fest, making India’s strategy a blueprint for success.The IPL’s recent seasons have showcased this evolution, with teams regularly posting 250+ totals, driven by aggressive intent and innovative strokeplay.England’s record-breaking 304/2 against South Africa last week (Sept 12) in a T20I further highlights how T20 cricket is rewriting its own boundaries. India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir has embraced this high-risk, high-reward philosophy and made his intentions clear earlier this year: “We want to try and get to 250-260 regularly.In trying to do that, there will be games where we will get bundled out for 120-130, and that is what T20 cricket is all about. Unless and until you don't play that high-risk cricket, you won't get those big rewards as well.”By stacking their line-up with versatile batters down to No. 8, India ensures resilience against early collapses and the firepower to capitalise on flat pitches or dew-heavy chases. But former India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin views India’s situation, where they boast high-quality bowlers, differently.“Countries like Australia, South Africa, and England will come with such batting line-ups… I am not sure if Shivam Dube is your third seamer. It’s not about him, but it’s about having a quality bowler in your line-up,” Ashwin stated on his YouTube channel.Known for his strategic thinking, the veteran acknowledged the importance of batting depth in T20s but advocated having a genuine bowler in the side in place of a part-timer. This is where he questioned the inclusion of Dube in the playing XI while leaving out Arshdeep.“These (overseas) teams have worked on the batting of players who can bowl well. In India, we believe that a batsman who can bowl a bit should be picked. Arshdeep Singh has displayed his batting credentials a few times. He can hit 1-2 sixes. In the India versus Pakistan game in New York, he contributed with the bat. If a player has that talent, there should be an effort to back him. It shouldn’t be like you don’t know batting, so sit out. Because in T20 cricket, a good four-over spell will make you win a competition,” he argued.The Asia Cup might not fully reveal India’s strategy for the 2026 World Cup, but it certainly offers crucial insights into how they wish to move forward.","India's strategy of building a batting line-up that extends to No. 8 reflects the game's relentless pursuit of runs at a frenetic pace. The 2026 T20 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, is set to amplify this trend. India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir has embraced this high-risk, high-reward philosophy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123903221,imgsize-47376,width-400,resizemode-4/shivam-dube-arshdeep-1509-.jpg"
'Best thing that could have happened to Dewald Brevis is to play domestic cricket': Allan Donald on SA20's most expensive player,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/best-thing-that-could-have-happened-to-dewald-brevis-is-to-play-domestic-cricket-allan-donald-on-sa20s-most-expensive-player/articleshow/123902995.cms,"Dewald Brevis (Image credit: Sportzpics)

NEW DELHI: Dewald Brevis earned the biggest bid during the auction for the fourth season of the SA20. As one franchise after another lifted their paddle, taking the bid up by multiple increments, it was the Proteria Capitals who acquired him for R16.5 million (Rs 8.31 crore). In the process, he became the most expensive player in SA20 history, just moments after Aiden Markram had urged the franchises to break the bank with R14 million. The previous most expensive player was Tristan Stubbs who was brought in by Sunrisers Eastern Cape for R9.2 million in 2022.Brevis, who had played the first three seasons for MI Cape Town, struck 676 runs in 32 matches and 29 innings at an average of 29.39 and a strike rate of over 145, with four half-centuries and a top score of an unbeaten 73 runs.During MI Cape Town's maiden title win last season, Brevis had a breakout season, scoring 291 runs in 10 matches at an average of 48.50 and a strike rate of 184.17, with two half-centuries.Brevis, 22, has had a remarkable journey in the last three years. The Johannesburg-born player made his first mark at the 2022 U-19 World Cup where he emerged as the leading run-scorer. He was immediately rewarded with an IPL contract by the Mumbai Indians and earned himself the nickname 'Baby AB', to go with his range of shots.A knock of 162 off 57 balls - the quickest in South African T20 history - fast-tracked him into the international side.However, just as quick as the rise came the decline. He scored just five runs in two matches after making his T20I debut and chinks in his armour were quite evident. Importantly, he was sent back to domestic cricket to improve on the basics.""The best thing that could ever have happened to Dewald Brevis is to play domestic cricket for almost two years,"" said Allan Donald to select Indian media in an interaction facilitated by SA20. ""If you take where Brevis started and how he leapfrogged everything, like from school, it was straight into Mumbai Indians and various leagues around the world. He struggled, he battled. Didn't do all that well. All of a sudden, he's released from Mumbai Indians, comes back all the way to domestic cricket where he found himself.""And last year was difficult to bowl to, to anybody in South African domestic cricket. He had to go back there. He had to go back and find his game and understand what he's about as a person. He's a humble young man. I've known him since he was a young boy playing in the garden.""I just saw this kid grow and grow fast, almost too fast. The talent was overwhelming. 'Baby AB' was born and all of a sudden, that pressure and expectation maybe just got the better of him.""He came back to domestic cricket and he found his mates and just grew. It was so good to see him knowing his game, understanding his game, speaking to guys like Albie Morkel in the system who is now with him there and took him under his wing. All of a sudden, he gets a lucky break. He gets a break from Chennai Super Kings, goes over there and just lit the world up. Like I said, timing is everything,"" Donald went on to explain.In IPL 2025, Brevis came on as an injury replacement for Gurjapneet Singh. The Rs 2.2 crore signing, having initially gone unsold at the IPL mega auction, made every penny count. In the six matches, he scored 225 runs at an average of 37.50 and strike rate of 180. He also produced two fifties - against Kolkata Knight Riders and Gujarat Titans - and appeared to set the foundation for being retained next season.The new Pretoria Capitals coach Sourav Ganguly was central to the big money signing and the franchise needed a batter of Brevis' capabilities. Last season, Will Jacks was the top-scorer for Pretoria, scoring 225 runs in 10 matches, and the 15th highest scorer in the league. ""Brevis is an exciting talent; his game has shown significant improvement. We saw that against Australia in the recent series. In auctions, though, money isn't always a reflection of a player's quality; it comes down to supply and demand. We're delighted to have Brevis with us,"" Ganguly had said.Donald concurred that Brevis was going to be a superstar, even if he doesn't quite have the versatility of his idol AB de Villiers. ""This kid has got the talent to, I wouldn't say match that, but he has got the talent to win games from nothing. He's shown it domestically. He's now showing it on the bigger stage out there, he showed in Australia against a very good Australian team,"" referring to an unbeaten 125 runs in 56 balls in August.""The talent and the execution of this young man, there's no doubting that. Absolutely not. (But) There's always going to be one AB. There always has been one AB. This guy's got all the mannerisms of AB de Villiers and almost cloned himself on AB de Villiers. Why not have a hero like AB de Villiers?""The fact that he can do things that other batsmen [batters] can't? 100%. Brevis is that sort of player. I think that as the years go on we'll see how he develops and carries on in all formats. I know he wants to play Test cricket, but this format and the white ball stuff, the shortest of them all, he could be an absolute superstar. There is no doubt that he's going to be an absolute superstar,"" he stated.",Dewald Brevis becomes the most expensive player in SA20 history. Proteria Capitals signed the 22-year-old for R16.5 million (Rs 8.31 crore) The Johannesburg-born player made his first mark at the 2022 U-19 World Cup.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123903052,imgsize-67604,width-400,resizemode-4/dewald-brevis-image-credit-sportzpics.jpg"

Poll How do you feel about Manchester City's performance against Manchester United? Outstanding Solid Average

Manchester City cruised to a commanding 3-0 victory over rivals Manchester United on Sunday, with Erling Haaland scoring twice after Phil Foden’s opener at the Etihad Stadium.The result handed Pep Guardiola’s side a timely lift after back-to-back league defeats, while piling more pressure on United manager Ruben Amorim, whose team have now taken just four points from their first four games.City began strongly and made the breakthrough inside 20 minutes. Jeremy Doku’s persistence on the left allowed his cross to find an unmarked Foden to head home.After the restart, Haaland extended the advantage in trademark fashion, racing clear before lifting the ball calmly over Altay Bayindir. Moments later, the Norwegian spurned an open-goal chance when he rounded the goalkeeper but struck the post, keeping United faintly in the contest.Any hopes of a response were dashed by a standout moment from debutant Gianluigi Donnarumma, who clawed away Bryan Mbeumo’s volley at full stretch to preserve City’s two-goal cushion. Minutes later, Harry Maguire’s misplaced pass allowed Bernardo Silva to release Haaland, who finished emphatically to seal the points.The win keeps City six points behind leaders Liverpool but restores momentum ahead of a demanding week featuring fixtures against Napoli and Arsenal. For United, it was another disappointing derby day, with fans audibly expressing their frustration towards Amorim as chants of “sacked in the morning” echoed from the away section.The occasion was preceded by a solemn moment as both sets of supporters paid tribute to boxing great Ricky Hatton, who passed away earlier on Sunday. A lifelong City supporter, Hatton’s image was displayed during a minute’s applause.",Erling Haaland scored twice as Manchester City beat Manchester United 3-0 at the Etihad Stadium.

When is the Manchester Derby?





Where will the Manchester City vs Man United game be played?

The first Manchester derby of the season arrives with both sides searching for rhythm, setting up a tense battle at the Etihad Stadium. Pride, bragging rights and crucial points are at stake as Guardiola’s City and Amorim’s United prepare to write the latest chapter in their rivalry.City, usually relentless at home, have looked shaky in the initial weeks. Defeats to Tottenham (0-2) and Brighton (1-2) have already left the champions six points below Liverpool, raising questions about their readiness for this season. Guardiola will hand Gianluigi Donnarumma his debut in goal, as the Italian looks to steady City’s back line.United, meanwhile, arrive with littel confidence despite finally recording their first win of the campaign. Bruno Fernandes’ stoppage-time penalty, coupled with Burnley’s disallowed equaliser via semi-automated offside, salvaged a 3-2 result at Old Trafford. It was far from convincing, but it eased pressure after a winless run.United boss Amorim has already clarified that the trio of Mason Mount, Matheus Cunha and Diogo Dalot will not be available for the match.The goalkeeper situation remains a talking point on both sides.While Donnarumma is set for his City start, Amorim said that Senne Lammens must wait, opting to stick with Altay Bayindir despite criticism of his form.With both managers under early scrutiny and squads still searching for consistency, the derby could provide a turning point.Ahead of the game, neither side are in the top ten of the league standings.

Real Madrid secured a 2-1 victory against Real Sociedad in Saturday's Spanish league match, led by Kylian Mbappé who scored one goal and assisted another, despite playing with 10 men for nearly an hour. Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid earned its first season win before their Champions League clash with Liverpool, and Athletic Bilbao suffered a defeat ahead of hosting Arsenal.Mbappé demonstrated his scoring prowess in the 12th minute, capitalizing on a poor Sociedad pass to score his fourth goal of the season. He outpaced defenders and successfully shot past goalkeeper Alex Remiro.Madrid faced a significant challenge when new defender Dean Huijsen received a red card in the 32nd minute for pulling down Mikel Oyarzabal who had only the goalkeeper to beat.Despite being a man down, Madrid extended their lead before halftime. Mbappé's skillful dribbling near the byline created space to find Arda Guler, who converted the opportunity into Madrid's second goal.Sociedad narrowed the gap in the 56th minute when Oyarzabal scored from the penalty spot, awarded after the ball hit Dani Carvajal's arm in the area.""The red card changed the game a bit.

When is the Barcelona vs Valencia match?



Where will the match be played?



Barcelona return to La Liga action on Sunday against Valencia, but their first home fixture of the season will not be played at Camp Nou. The Catalan club is still waiting on permits to reopen its renovated stadium and will instead use the 6,000-capacity Estadi Johan Cruyff, normally reserved for the women’s and youth teams.Club president Joan Laporta addressed the situation earlier this week, saying: “We will be back to the Camp Nou as soon as possible.” Until then, Barcelona must adapt to life in a far smaller venue.Coach Hansi Flick also faces a selection headache. Frenkie de Jong, Alejandro Balde and Gavi remain unavailable through injury, with De Jong’s setback occurring while on international duty with the Netherlands. Goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen continues to be sidelined as well, reducing Flick’s options further.Furthermore, Lamine Yamal will also play no part in the game owing to injuries sustained while on duty for Spain.Despite the off-field and fitness concerns, Barcelona remain unbeaten and will look to maintain their strong start under Flick. Valencia, meanwhile, arrive in search of an upset that could shift early-season momentum.The fixture marks the first major test of how Barcelona manage both reduced squad depth and the unusual circumstances of playing without their iconic stadium.With young talents like Lamine Yamal stepping up in attack, the champions will aim to keep pace with early leaders Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao.- The matchday 2 fixture will be streamed live on the FanCode app and website.- There will be no live broadcast in India for the 2025/26 La Liga season.The matchday 4 clash between Valencia and Barca will kick off on Sunday, September 14 (Monday, September 15 in India) at 9:00 PM Local time (12:30 AM IST).The match between Valencia and Barcelona will not be played at Camp Nou.

New Delhi: Naushad Moosa has taken a break. After the India U-23 coach failed to make the grade in the AFC U-23 Asian Cup 2026 Qualifiers, the former India international defender stayed back in Doha to spend a couple of days with friends.The Qatari capital was bombed on Tuesday, a day after India narrowly lost to the hosts. Was it safe for him to stay back? Moosa told TOI, “It created some panic that night but things settled down after that.”His team’s performance in the three Doha qualifiers made the people back home sit up and take notice. The social media was full of clips showing Muhammed Suhail's impressive solo effort for the opening strike.Naushad Moosa’s boys finished fifth among the eleven second-placed teams, just one spot behind the qualification places. They won against Bahrain (2-0), drubbed Brunei 6-0 and narrowly lost to hosts Qatar 2-1.“Agreed there is lot to cheer about the U-23 boys’ display, but what concerns me is, what next? Most of them will warm the bench when they go back to their clubs. They won’t get much game time. They end up playing developmental games,” pointed out Moosa.“This lack of continuity has been a major problem for us,” he continued, “These boys need to play consistently at the senior level now.They are good enough for senior India too.”Moosa said he has related this issue with the AIFF too and can only hope it can be addressed. Moosa’s strong message to the young players is to find clubs where they can get playing time.For now, Moosa will return to Guwahati to join NorthEast United, where he is part of the coaching staff. Praising his boys for their adventurous display, Moosa said that Suhail, the most talked about youngster currently, should remain focused.“These boys should concentrate on the game but for that they have to be kept engaged with competitive games.”","Naushad Moosa's boys finished fifth among the eleven second-placed teams.

Real Madrid’s defensive plans have taken a hit as centre-back Antonio Rudiger faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines following a muscle injury in his left leg. The German international, 32, suffered the setback during training on Friday, and early reports suggest he could be out for around two months.The club confirmed in a statement that scans revealed an injury to Rudiger’s rectus femoris muscle. While Real Madrid did not provide an exact recovery timeline, Spanish outlet AS described the injury as “serious.” The veteran defender has only featured once in La Liga this season, after managing 55 appearances for the club last year despite battling through injuries.Rudiger’s absence leaves Real with limited options at centre-back, though the club strengthened the position this summer by signing 20-year-old Dean Huijsen from Bournemouth. Reports also suggest that Real Madrid are keeping an eye on Liverpool’s France international Ibrahima Konaté, potentially as reinforcement at the end of the season.The Spanish champions face a busy schedule ahead, with a La Liga trip to Real Sociedad on Saturday followed by their Champions League opener against Marseille on Tuesday. Manager Carlo Ancelotti will be forced to reshuffle his defensive lineup in the absence of Rüdiger.Meanwhile, Jude Bellingham, who has been managing a shoulder injury, has opted for surgery following his Club World Cup commitments. The England midfielder has now begun rehabilitation, with Real Madrid hopeful of seeing him return later this season.With Rudiger sidelined and Bellingham recovering, Real Madrid will need to rely on squad depth as they juggle domestic and European challenges in the opening months of the campaign.",Antonio Rudiger faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines with a muscle injury.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

NEW DELHI: In what comes as an encouraging development for India ahead of next month’s T20 World Cup, India's dependable batter in T20Is, Tilak Varma, is close to being cleared by the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru.Tilak is expected to be cleared after taking part in a simulation match on Friday. The left-handed batter is recovering from abdominal surgery and has been training at the CoE. He was initially expected to join the Indian squad for the final two T20Is against New Zealand, but the team management had asked his replacement, Shreyas Iyer, to remain with the squad.The BCCI has said that Tilak will join the Indian team in Mumbai on February 3, subject to regaining full match fitness, ahead of India’s World Cup warm-up fixture.Fast bowler Mayank Yadav has also regained full bowling fitness after spending nearly a year out with a lower back stress fracture. The 23-year-old is set to make his comeback with India A during the T20 World Cup warm-up matches. Mayank had impressed with his pace during IPL 2024 and earned a T20I call-up, but featured in only two competitive matches in the 2025 season due to the injury. Despite his fitness issues, Lucknow Super Giants retained him for the 2026 IPL season.Riyan Parag, who has been sidelined with a right shoulder injury, is also likely to be cleared after Friday’s simulation match at the CoE.Washington Sundar, meanwhile, is yet to play a simulation game, which is expected to be scheduled soon. The 26-year-old has been out of action since suffering acute discomfort in his lower rib area while bowling during the first ODI against New Zealand in Vadodara on January 11. He was subsequently ruled out of the remainder of the ODI series and the ongoing T20I series.",Tilak Varma is close to being cleared by the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru.

Sanju Samson headache for Team India | Is Ishan Kishan the right choice?

VIZAG: Coming into the penultimate match before the T20 World Cup begins, India’s aim was to fine-tune their final preparations. However, it was a reality check for the hosts as they succumbed to a 50-run loss in the fourth T20I at the ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium here on Wednesday.Playing with a batter less — Ishan Kishan was out with a niggle — India were set a challenging target of 216 by the Kiwis. However, the hosts lost wickets at regular intervals to be all out for 165 in 18.4 overs.Abhishek Sharma departed off the very first ball when he holed out to third-man off Matt Henry, while Suryakumar Yadav (8 off 8; 2x4) was caught brilliantly by Jacob Duffy off his own bowling with just nine runs on the board for India.All eyes were on Sanju Samson, who was struggling to find form. He began well, driving and flicking Henry for a couple of boundaries, while Rinku Singh then danced down to smash Zak Foulkes for a couple of sixes in the fourth over. Samson then flicked Duffy over mid-wicket six to take India to 53/2 in the powerplay.However, Santner broke the 46-run third-wicket stand, striking twin blows in as many overs. He first got one straighten after pitching to rattle rattled Samson’s stumps (24 off 15b; 3x4, 1x6), extending his wretched form.He then forced a false stroke from Hardik Pandya (2), who was caught at backward point to leave India reeling at 63/4.Foulkes then trapped Rinku (39 off 30; 3x4, 2x6) in front in the 11th, sucking the momentum out of the chase.Shivam Dube hit Ish Sodhi for 29 runs in with three huge sixes to bring the contest alive in the 12th over. He then dispatched Duffy over mid-wicket and deep square leg for two sixes, reaching his half-century off just 15 deliveries. He hit two more sixes off Duffy but the innings came to an end when he was run out after backing up too much when Harshit Rana hit one straight that rattled stumps after deflecting off bowler Henry’s hands.Dube’s wicket ended the hosts’ hopes of a victory. Earlier, asked to bat first, openers Tim Seifert (62 off 36b; 7x4, 3x6) and Devon Conway (44 off 23b; 4x4, 3x6) added 100 runs for the opening stand in 8.1 overs. Seifert was lucky to begin with as he topedged Arshdeep Singh twice to third man during the hat-trick of boundaries in the first over.He lofted Harshit Rana for two sixes in successive overs and hit Bumrah for another straight down to bring up the team’s 50 in 4.3 overs.Conway joined in next, hitting Ravi Bishnoi for a couple of boundaries and a six for a 16-run over to take New Zealand to 71/0 in the Powerplay. Seifert reached his half-century off 25 balls at the other end.",India lose to New Zealand by 50 runs in fourth ODI. Hosts were all out for 165 in 18.4 overs.

Inside details of Washington Sundar's recovery at BCCI CoE | Why India are patient | T20 World Cup

NEW DELHI: Washington Sundar is scheduled to undergo a fitness test at the BCCI ’s Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru on Feb 4, three days ahead of the start of India’s T20 World Cup campaign on Feb 7. The spin-bowling allrounder’s availability for the tournament is currently in doubt as his recovery from a side strain is taking a lot longer than what was expected. Wasington sustained the in the first ODI against New Zealand on Jan 11.TOI understands that the team management and the selectors are willing to wait for an official medical update on Washington before initiating backup plans. Teams are allowed to make changes till Jan 30 but injury replacements can be made even during the tournament if approved by the tournament’s technical committee. The Indian team is slated to assemble in Mumbai for its first training session Feb 3 before playing a warm-up match against South Africa on Feb 4.Washington’s fitness test could provide an idea about the rate of his recovery. While the Indian cricket board (BCCI) never specified the nature of the injury, sources said that he has suffered a muscle tear near the ribs at the back.On Wednesday, Tilak Varma and Riyan Parag played a simulation match at the CoE while Washington didn’t perfor m any intense drills. “Washington’s injury needs to heal naturally before he gets back to the return-to-play process,” a BCCI source said. Tilak is expected to join the team before the warm-up game.The team wears a settled look even without vice-captain Axar Patel taking the field in the ongoing T20I series against New Zealand. While Parag is seen as a like-for-like replacement for Washington, the team management has struck a good balance even without a spin-bowling allrounder. “If Washington can be fit for the later stages of the WC, the team may wait for him,” the source said.",Washington Sundar is scheduled to undergo a fitness test at the BCCI ’s Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru on Feb 4.

NEW DELHI: “Mujhe Virat Kohli jaisa banna hai. Main unke saath khelna chahta hoon [I want to become like Virat Kohli and want to play with him],” a nine-year-old Vihaan Malhotra told his coach Kamal Sandhu when he joined his Cricket Hub Academy in Patiala. Back then, the kid had no idea that his words, desire and dream would one day turn into reality. Now 19, Vihaan — who has been making a name for himself in the ongoing Under-19 World Cup in Zimbabwe — is set to play for Royal Challengers Bengaluru. He will be sharing the dressing room, dugout, ground and crease with Kohli in IPL 2026. Vihaan was bought for Rs 30 lakh at the IPL 2026 auction.“Kya pata tha woh bolega yeh aur yeh ek din sach ho jaayega. I am really happy for him. Virat ki videos dekhta tha — uske shots, especially cover drive, isko achhe lagte the. He is also a fitness freak. He always admired Virat and tried to take everything from that legend’s book.“Playing at RCB will give him a lot of learnings. He is happy — really happy,” the coach said.Vihaan is India’s only centurion in the ongoing ICC Under-19 World Cup.His unbeaten hundred powered India to a comprehensive win over Zimbabwe in their first Super Sixes match of the 2026 Under-19 World Cup in Bulawayo. India set Zimbabwe a daunting target of 353 before skittling them out for 148 in just 37.4 overs.Vihaan leapt into the air, removed his helmet, stretched out his arms and celebrated the century in style. The celebration said it all — a clear message: “I can do anything.”The 19-year-old hasn’t taken long to adopt that mindset in his career. Once an opener, he is now ready to bat at any position, can bowl and pick up wickets, tighten the noose around batters with his spin, and is an acrobat in the field.Before his century against Zimbabwe, Vihaan also claimed four wickets and pulled off two breathtaking catches against Bangladesh.“Hamesha kehta hai, ‘Sir, main kuch bhi kar lunga,’ jab Under-19 World Cup ke liye ja raha tha. He has prepared himself like that. All I told him in the beginning was that if you have to stay in the team for long, then you need to be an all-dimensional player. You should know bowling too, and your fielding has to be brilliant,” the coach said.“He is a proper batter, but he has worked a lot on his bowling too. After batting for four-five hours, he shifts towards bowling and bowls almost seven-eight overs every day at the nets. With time, he has become a good spinner too. And then he signs off his practice session with some fielding drills and watching some of Virat’s videos,” Sandhu, who also trained the likes of Prabhsimran Singh, Anmolpreet Singh and Naman Dhir, said.Vihaan also trained under Ravneet Ricky, a member of India’s triumphant squad at the Under-19 World Cup in 2000 under Mohammad Kaif’s captaincy.Ricky, who began coaching Vihaan in 2022, describes him as the team’s crisis man.“He actually came to me in 2022, when I was the head coach of the Under-16 Punjab team. He was an opener. He has given up that position and made himself an ‘any position’ player. You send him in at any position or situation — he will deliver. He always wanted to be an opener, and when the management told him to play in the middle order, he didn’t say anything, accepted it very gracefully, and performed,” Ricky said.“I am really happy for him that he is going to share the dressing room with a legend like Virat Kohli this year at RCB. After the IPL, a more refined Vihaan will come through. He will have a different approach and mindset after talking to and spending time with Virat. Virat and I have played together a couple of times,” Ricky added.The year 2025 proved impressive for Vihaan. He amassed 277 runs in two Youth Tests, including a knock of 120, and followed it up with 243 runs in five Youth ODIs, highlighted by a century in the fourth match.Just like every family of doctors and engineers wants their child to follow a similar profession, Vihaan too was nudged in that direction.His father Manoj Malhotra, an engineer, and mother Poonam Malhotra, a doctor, took their son to Sandhu to play cricket as a hobby, unaware that the boy had already decided his career long ago.For coach Sandhu, Vihaan was destined to become a cricketer — even though he first came to pursue the sport as a hobby.“This is a very interesting story. They said, ‘Coach saab, aap please cricket khilao. Mobile phones se door rahega khaali time mein.’ He was excellent in academics too — almost 95 percent in his schooling. He is a dynamic kid, but he kept cricket at the top. I told his parents the kid is talented and to let him play,” Sandhu said.“The moment he crossed 15, his mental strength was something to see. He used to give a lot of time to cricket. With time, he started giving all his time to cricket. I have seen him practising alone too. Coming in the morning around 11 and going back at night at 9 or 10 became his routine,” the coach said.“There are a lot of plans for IPL preparation. Let him come back — we will start those drills too,” the coach signed off.","Vihaan Malhotra is set to play for Royal Challengers Bengaluru in IPL 2026.

Sanju Samson or Ishan Kishan? | Greenstone Lobo predicts the ideal player for T20 World Cup

Former champions Royal Challengers Bengaluru produced a commanding all-round display to thrash UP Warriorz by eight wickets, sealing their spot in the WPL final and all but ending the opposition’s playoff hopes here on Thursday.After opting to bowl, RCB clawed their way back impressively despite a brisk start from UP Warriorz. Nadine de Klerk led the fightback with a brilliant spell of 4 for 22, while Grace Harris chipped in with 2 for 22, as UPW slipped from a strong position to post a modest 143 for eight.Harris then made the chase a one-sided affair. The Australian unleashed a blistering 75 off just 37 deliveries, ensuring RCB romped home with 41 balls to spare. The emphatic victory lifted RCB to 12 points, confirming a top-of-the-table finish in the five-team competition.In contrast, UP Warriorz were left rooted to the bottom with four points and the poorest net run-rate, their campaign hanging by a thread despite having a game in hand.Harris set the tempo early, targeting Kranti Gaud in the powerplay and plundering five boundaries in the third over alone. She reached her half-century in just 28 balls, lifting Asha Sobhana over long-on, and dominated a 108-run stand with captain Smriti Mandhana . Mandhana played the perfect supporting role, bringing up a classy fifty off 26 balls.Although Harris was eventually bowled by Shikha Pandey while attempting to work a cross-seam delivery, the result was already beyond doubt, with only 36 runs needed and plenty of overs left.Earlier, UP Warriorz had looked well placed thanks to Deepti Sharma’s fluent 55 off 43 balls, her first fifty of the season. Deepti and Meg Lanning put on their best opening stand of the campaign, adding 72 in just 49 balls. However, once Lanning fell, the innings lost momentum.From a comfortable 74 without loss after eight overs, UPW slumped to 103 for four as de Klerk and Harris tightened the screws through the middle phase. De Klerk removed Lanning and trapped Amy Jones lbw, before Harris struck in consecutive overs to dismiss Harleen Deol and Chloe Tryon, swinging the contest decisively in RCB’s favour.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru thrash UP Warriorz by eight wickets.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

MUMBAI: In recent years, the Mumbai Cricket Association's ground at Bandra-Kurla Complex has been the preferred venue for Mumbai’s home Ranji Trophy matches. On Thursday, however, pollution and dust from a construction site near the ground disrupted play and raised concerns among players.During the final session of the day one play, Mumbai players Sarfaraz Khan, his younger brother Musheer Khan, and off-spinning all-rounder Himanshu Singh were forced to wear masks for around 30 minutes while fielding due to dust and pollution from the nearby construction activity. Members of the support staff sitting outside the dressing room were also seen wearing masks.""Mumbai’s team management has written to the Mumbai Cricket Association about the problem of pollution due to the under-construction building here, which has led to a lot of dust and pollution on the ground. We’ve requested the MCA to take it up with the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). Players and members of support staff sitting just outside the dressing room too were forced to wear masks. In fact, a few players of the Delhi team also requested us to give a few masks to them. Running on the ground can be difficult in such conditions,"" a source in the Mumbai team told TOI.The Air Quality Index at BKC was 156 on Thursday evening, which was listed as ‘unhealthy’.""The construction work was going on (nearby), because of which people were feeling the pollution. That's why we were wearing masks,"" Mumbai seamer Mohit Avasthi told reporters later. Avasthi finished the day with figures of five for 62 in 16.4 overs.In conditions affected by smog, Delhi were bowled out for 221, with opener Sanat Sangwan scoring his third century of the season. Sangwan made 118 off 218 balls, hitting 11 fours and two sixes. Mumbai were 13 for one at stumps, with play ending five to seven minutes before the scheduled close due to poor light."," pollution and dust from a construction site near the ground disrupted play and raised concerns among players.

Sanju Samson or Ishan Kishan? | Greenstone Lobo predicts the ideal player for T20 World Cup

Indian leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal has delivered a blunt assessment of Sanju Samson ’s prolonged dip in form, insisting that pressure cannot be cited as a justification for the wicketkeeper-batter’s repeated failures. Samson’s struggles continued in the fourth T20I against New Zealand in Visakhapatnam, further clouding his prospects ahead of the T20 World Cup 2026.Chahal underlined that a player of Samson’s experience should be capable of dealing with challenging phases. He noted that the ongoing series had provided ample chances for Samson to make a statement, but the performances had not matched expectations. According to Chahal, consistent low scores cannot be excused as mental pressure, particularly for someone who has spent over a decade in international cricket.“Sanju Samson has played for many years. He started in the IPL middle-order, then became an opener. After playing international cricket for 10-12 years, pressure shouldn't be an excuse. He has had four chances in this series. I can accept failure in one or two matches, but not in three or four. He knows someone like Ishan Kishan , who is the backup and is batting well at number three, is waiting. Sanju will blame himself. He had four opportunities but could not make them count,” Chahal said on JioStar.Despite his criticism, Chahal advised against knee-jerk reactions, pointing out that the T20 World Cup is still some way off and decisions should be taken with a broader perspective.“However, there's no need to feel too bad because the T20 World Cup is still far. There's one more match against New Zealand. It now depends on the team management's thinking. If they feel Sanju is struggling as an opener and Ishan is doing well at number three, then the right call would be to make Sanju sit out and let Ishan Kishan take his spot as the opener and wicketkeeper in the final T20I,” he added.Samson once again failed to capitalise on a decent start in the fourth T20I, scoring 24 off 15 balls before being dismissed by Mitchell Santner . The pattern has become familiar. In his last five T20I innings, his highest score is 37, achieved during the recent series against South Africa. Across his last 15 appearances, the Trivandrum-born batter has managed just 262 runs at an average of 17.46.With only 40 runs across the New Zealand series so far, the 31-year-old is under increasing pressure, especially with Ishan Kishan making strong contributions at No. 3 whenever available. The battle for places is intensifying as India move closer to settling combinations for the global tournament.Kishan, however, missed the fourth T20I due to a niggle, and his availability for the fifth and final match at the Greenfield International Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram on January 31 remains uncertain.","Yuzvendra Chahal says pressure cannot be cited as a justification for Sanju Samson’s repeated failures.

Sanju Samson or Ishan Kishan? | Greenstone Lobo predicts the ideal player for T20 World Cup

Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting has backed Glenn Maxwell to rediscover his spark at the upcoming T20 World Cup, insisting that a difficult Big Bash League season should not define what the all-rounder can deliver on the biggest stage.Maxwell endured a tough BBL campaign with Melbourne Stars, scoring just 76 runs at an average of 15.20, claiming two wickets and struggling in the field with several dropped catches. He has been rested for Australia’s three-match T20I series against Pakistan but is set to rejoin the squad in Sri Lanka ahead of their tournament opener against Ireland on February 11.Ponting, speaking to The West Australian, highlighted Maxwell’s unpredictability as both a challenge and a strength.“He can because he always has. I've coached him a lot and he's a really hard player to read what's going to happen because he can have a week of the best training you've ever seen and then come out and it does not happen. And he could have the world's worst week leading into a game and come out and do something crazy,” Ponting said.While acknowledging that age can play a role, Ponting believes the World Cup environment could bring the best out of Maxwell once again.“If the edge starts to come off, it's hard to find it and replace it. But if anything's going to bring it out of him, a World Cup will. He's had some pretty amazing moments in World Cups in the past and hopefully for Australia's sake he can have a few more over the next few weeks.”Ponting expects Maxwell to be named in Australia’s XI for the opener, with the defending champions drawn in Group B alongside Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka and Oman. He admitted recent form alone would not justify selection but pointed to experience and conditions as key factors.“You couldn't pick him on form at the moment because of what everyone else in that squad has done through the BBL. But they'll pick him because of his experience and probably because of the conditions as well,” Ponting said.He added that the presence of spin-friendly conditions and a relatively gentle start to the tournament could help Maxwell find rhythm. “He's probably going to be facing a lot of spin bowling and he'll give the option to be able to bowl some as well. They've got some pretty easy games and that might be just exactly what he needs to get himself into some touch. A bit of soft opposition early on and some runs and wickets under his belt, that might hold him in good stead for the back half. ”Ponting also named Steve Smith as the leading candidate for a call-up should Australia suffer any injury setbacks. Smith enjoyed an outstanding BBL, scoring 299 runs at an average of 59.80 in six matches, including a century, after producing two fifties and a hundred during Australia’s home Ashes series.“His numbers stack up better than anybody else's. But when you've been out and the side's had some success, and Travis Head and Mitch Marsh are the incumbents, it's hard to push one of those two guys out of an opening slot,” Ponting said.He noted that Smith’s role in the shortest format may have limited his recent opportunities. “And poor Steve has probably been pigeonholed as an opening batsman only in the T20 game, which probably has held him back a little bit in the last few years as far as selection is concerned. But he's only one little injury away. He's the next cab off the rank and he's ready to go.”","Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting has backed Glenn Maxwell to rediscover his spark at the upcoming T20 World Cup. Maxwell endured a tough BBL campaign with Melbourne Stars, scoring just 76 runs at an average of 15.20. He has been rested for Australia’s three-match T20I series against Pakistan but is set to rejoin the squad in Sri Lanka.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127772736,imgsize-115760,width-400,resizemode-4/steve-smith.jpg"

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Iceland Cricket has taken aim at the Pakistan Cricket Board through a series of sarcastic posts on social media over the past week, reacting to developments linked to the ICC T20 World Cup.In its latest post, Iceland Cricket said that even if Pakistan were to pull out of the tournament now, Iceland would not be in a position to replace them, citing a lack of time to prepare.In a sarcastic post on X, Iceland Cricket wrote: ""It is with a heavy heart that we now announce our unavailability to replace Pakistan in the upcoming T20 World Cup. Regardless of whether they now withdraw, the short timescales ensure it is impossible for our squad to prepare in the professional manner necessary to compete effectively in this global cricketing spectacle. We are not like Scotland and able to turn up on a whim, with no kit sponsor. ""The post further explained the background of its players and their commitments outside cricket. ""Our players are from all walks of life and cannot simply drop their occupations to fly halfway around the world to experience temperatures only normally felt in Finnish saunas. Our captain, a professional baker, needs to attend to his oven, our ship captain needs to steer his vessel, and our bankers need to go bankrupt (again).This is the harsh reality of cricket at the amateur level of the game,"" the post said.""This news will be extremely disappointing to our fans. Despite being the most peaceful nation on Earth, we maintain an army of online followers, and are the world's 14th most followed national board on X. We were ready to give the Dutch the biggest shock they have experienced since William of Orange lost the Battle of Landen in 1693. And the Americans were looking forward to taking on Greenland, or so their orange-dyed leader thought,"" Iceland Cricket said, taking a veiled jibe at Donald Trump.Iceland Cricket also mentioned Uganda in the same post and said Pakistan’s absence, if it happens, could benefit them. ""Our loss is likely Uganda's gain. We wish them well. Their kits cannot be missed unless you have epilepsy, in which case they are probably best avoided,"" it added.Meanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board, led by Mohsin Naqvi, is expected to make a final decision on Friday. Reports say the Pakistan team has already booked its travel plans and will travel to Colombo along with the Australian team.","Iceland Cricket has taken aim at the Pakistan Cricket Board through a series of sarcastic posts on social media.

Shivam Dube press conference: On mindset shift, reading bowlers and dominating middle overs

Pakistan’s participation in the ICC T20 World Cup 2026 has been thrown into doubt following Bangladesh’s removal from the tournament, with the Pakistan Cricket Board issuing a strong warning that it could pull out in protest.PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi stated that the final decision would rest with the government, adding that clarity on the matter was expected either by Friday or early next week. The threat, however, has been met with scepticism from outside Pakistan, including from former India captain Ajinkya Rahane Reacting to the possibility of a boycott on a Cricbuzz show, Rahane dismissed the idea outright.“I don't think they can do that, I don't think they have, am I allowed to say guts? Yeah, I don't think they can do that,” Rahane said, before adding bluntly: “They are going to come.”The backdrop to the controversy is Bangladesh’s exclusion from the tournament. The Bangladesh Cricket Board refused to play its matches in India and pushed for the venue to be shifted to Sri Lanka. The ICC rejected that request, after which Bangladesh maintained its stance and was subsequently replaced by Scotland.Pakistan have positioned their boycott threat as a stand against Bangladesh’s removal, but such a move could come at a heavy cost.According to a report by Cricbuzz, the ICC has already warned the PCB that failing to honour its participation agreement could trigger serious disciplinary measures.These potential consequences reportedly include sanctions, suspension from international and regional competitions, and even the withdrawal of No-Objection Certificates for overseas players participating in the Pakistan Super League. The report further noted that the PCB has no legitimate basis to boycott either the T20 World Cup or the marquee India vs Pakistan clash scheduled to be played in Sri Lanka on February 15, 2026.","Pakistan’s participation in the ICC T20 World Cup 2026 has been thrown into doubt.

Poll How do you feel about the crowd's behavior during the African Cup final? Completely unacceptable A result of passion Somewhat understandable

Africa’s football governing body has handed down fines exceeding $1 million and imposed multiple bans following a chaotic African Cup final that descended into protests, crowd trouble and ugly scenes on and off the pitch.The Confederation of African Football (CAF) announced the sanctions on Wednesday in response to the disorder-marred final between Senegal and hosts Morocco on January 18, a match that featured a dramatic walk-off protest, fans attempting to storm the field and even scuffles involving journalists. Crucially, CAF clarified that the bans apply only to African competitions and will not affect the upcoming World Cup in June, for which both Senegal and Morocco have already qualified.CAF fined the Senegalese Football Federation $615,000 and the Moroccan federation $315,000 for unsporting and improper conduct by players, coaching staff and supporters. Senegal coach Pape Thiaw received the heaviest individual punishment — a five-match ban in CAF competitions and a personal fine of $100,000 — after leading his players off the pitch in protest at a late penalty awarded to Morocco.The final was halted for around 15 minutes following the walk-off.When play resumed, Morocco missed the penalty and Senegal went on to clinch the African title with a 1-0 win after extra time.The fallout extended far beyond the walk-off. Supporters tried to breach the pitch, players from both teams clashed on the sidelines, and reporters from Senegal and Morocco were involved in fights in press areas. One of the most bizarre flashpoints came when Moroccan ball boys attempted to snatch a towel from Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy, apparently to distract him. That incident alone resulted in an additional $200,000 fine for Morocco’s federation.Morocco coach Walid Regragui later described the spectacle as giving African football a “shameful” image, a comment that resonated as scrutiny intensified on the country, which will co-host the 2030 World Cup with Spain and Portugal and hopes to stage the final at the 115,000-capacity Hassan II Stadium currently under construction.CAF also banned Senegal’s Iliman Ndiaye and Ismaila Sarr for two matches each, while Morocco’s Achraf Hakimi received a two-match ban with one suspended. Ismael Saibari was hit with a three-match ban and a $100,000 fine for unsporting behaviour.An appeal by Morocco to have the result annulled and the title awarded to them was dismissed. The match even strained diplomatic ties, though Senegal Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko later played down the fallout, calling the reaction “emotional outbursts produced by fervor” rather than a deeper rift.","Africa's football governing body hands down fines exceeding $1 million.

The Chinese Football Association (CFA) announced Thursday that 73 people, including former national team coach Li Tie, have been banned for life, and 13 professional clubs have been fined for match-fixing and corruption.The punishments come as part of a wider anti-corruption campaign under President Xi Jinping, which has removed several CFA officials and banned dozens of players for match-fixing and gambling.The statement did not say when the most recent match-fixing occurred or give details of the cases.The punishments were made after a ""systematic review"" and were needed ""to enforce industry discipline, purify the football environment, and maintain fair competition"", the CFA wrote on its official social media account Thursday.Li Tie, a former Everton player who coached China’s national team from 2019 to 2021, is already serving a 20-year prison sentence for bribery, after being sentenced in December 2024.Chen Xuyuan, former CFA chairman, is also serving a life sentence for accepting $11 million in bribes.Of the 16 teams in the 2025 Chinese Super League, 11 will face point deductions and fines.Tianjin Jinmen Tiger and last season’s runners-up Shanghai Shenhua will each lose 10 points and pay a one million yuan ($144,000) fine when the 2026 season begins.Shanghai Port, champions for the past three seasons, and Beijing Guoan will each lose five points and pay a 400,000-yuan fine.","73 people, including former national team coach Li Tie, have been banned for life. 13 professional clubs have been fined for match-fixing and corruption.

Real Madrid dropped into the Champions League knockout playoffs after losing 4-2 at Benfica on Wednesday, finishing ninth in the 36-team league standings. Despite scoring twice through Kylian Mbappé, Madrid slipped out of the top eight and missed direct qualification to the round of 16.Benfica secured the final playoff spot in 24th place on goal difference after scoring in the eighth minute of stoppage time. Goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin scored with a header after Madrid had been reduced to nine players following red cards for Raul Asencio and Rodrygo.

Poll Are you excited for the start of the 2025-26 Indian Super League season? Absolutely! Somewhat Not Really Not at all

The 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season is tentatively scheduled to get underway on February 14 with a double header featuring Mohun Bagan Super Giant vs Kerala Blasters at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata and FC Goa vs Inter Kashi at Fatorda in Goa. The fixtures, running until May 17, are provisional as the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is looking to find a broadcaster to showcase India's top-division football.The AIFF is in the process of finding a suitable bidder to produce and broadcast the 91-match competition. If and when the bidder is found, the fixtures could be jiggled to meet the broadcasters' criteria.Four entities - FanCode, Sony Sports Network, Zee Sports and UK-based Two Circles - had attended the pre-bid conference. There is a possibility that more could throw their hat in the ring before the February 1 final date for submission of bids.As the process continues to unravel behind the scenes at the Football House (AIFF's headquarters) in New Delhi, there are a couple of questions that remain unanswered. Chief among them is the relegation clause.Promotion has been a part of the ISL since the 2022-23 season with Inter Kashi the latest team to come up the ladder from the I-League. Relegation, however, has never been a feature of the league that began in 2014.After Football Sports Development Limited's (FSDL) contract to run the ISL expired in December 2025, it is the first time that the AIFF are in charge of operating the ISL. The position on relegation gets trickier because of the Supreme Court-ratified Constitution.As per the Constitution adopted in October 2025, AIFF have the control over relegation rule. As per Article 63, ""Without prejudice to the foregoing, the AIFF shall have the right and discretion to take all decisions of any nature pertaining to any aspect of any competition. While exercising such discretion, the AIFF shall have due regard to the interests of the sport of Football in India and shall not be bound by any request or demand of any third party in this regard. If any of its powers or functions are delegated to third parties, such delegation shall be done in good faith and also ensuring that the AIFF retains primacy on all Essential Aspects.""A closer look at the definition of ""Essential Aspects"" explains it as ""preservation of the sanctity of promotion and relegation, and ensuring of compliance with FIFA/AFC statues with respect to the sport of football.""In essence, promotion and relegation are mandatory from the 2025/26 season onwards in the ISL.An AIFF insider told TimesofIndia.com that the relegation rules will be followed as per what is written in the Constitution.However, a majority of ISL clubs are not happy with the idea. With the season already starting five months late and to be played in a truncated format, the clubs are expecting minimal revenue. The financial strain has forced the clubs to reduce costs through operational cutbacks and salary corrections. A few clubs even paused first team operations before a headway arrived on January 6 courtesy Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya's intervention.One ISL club official has even asked AIFF to take cognisance of the situation and invoke force majeure, which is possible as per the AIFF Constitution.Article 78 reads: ""The General Body shall have the final decision on any matters not provided for in this Constitution and Regulations, or in cases of force majeure. General Body shall be competent to decide whether a situation amounts to force majeure scenario or not.""As things stand, AIFF has not approached the Supreme Court seeking a one-time relaxation from relegation for the 2025-26 ISL season. With two weeks to go into the start of the season, it remains to be seen if they will go against not just the Constitution but also the AFC Statutes.","The 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season is tentatively scheduled to get underway on February 14.

I'm really happy to have in this state of form and above all, because of the great work they are doing.""They are really committed to the team, they are the first who are pressing... they're giving this effort and solidarity that we need from them, so I'm very happy that their reward comes in the form of goals.""It was a lively but imprecise start at Villarreal's Estadio de la Ceramica, as the game glowed but neither side was able to seriously threaten.Georges Mikautadze lashed a volley narrowly wide after veteran forward Gerard Moreno found him with a floating cross.At the other end, Madrid midfielder Arda Guler fired straight at Villarreal stopper Luiz Junior after some tidy footwork, and then shot high over the bar at the end of a swift break.Villarreal's Juan Foyth limped off hurt in a blow for the hosts, who created a good chance for Pape Gueye just before the break.The Senegal midfielder, a champion at the Africa Cup of Nations last weekend, powered narrowly wide of the post.Vinicius, who excelled in Madrid's 6-1 Champions League rout of Monaco in midweek, also came close with a rasping effort that sailed across Luiz Junior's goal and wide.The 25-year-old Brazil forward went a 13th straight La Liga match without scoring, but was involved as Mbappe found the net two minutes into the second half.- 'Nightmare for defences' -Vinicius came into the box from the left flank and his low cross was blocked but Mbappe was on hand to squeeze home his 20th league goal of the campaign from close range.""They are a nightmare for defences,"" said Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. ""I hope they can keep bringing joy.""Villarreal had the better of the second half as they worked hard to pull level, but Moreno spurned their best chance by firing inches over when well-placed.In stoppage time, Mbappe was felled clumsily by Alfonso Pedraza in the box and the French forward cheekily dinked home the resulting penalty to seal Madrid's victory.Mbappe's team-mate Brahim Diaz, who missed a similar attempted Panenka penalty for Morocco in the Africa Cup of Nations final, was on the pitch to see it as he returned to action for his club.""For you,"" Mbappe appeared to say to Diaz during the celebration, indicating it was a gesture of support.""For me, the most important thing is that (the players) are united, we saw it last Wednesday with Vinicius's goal (against Monaco) and we saw it again today, with Brahim,"" Arbeloa told reporters.The Yellow Submarine are now 10 points behind leaders Madrid, having played one fewer match than Arbeloa's side.""We have to be a bit more accurate in attack against these kinds of teams,"" admitted Villarreal midfielder Alberto Moleiro.Elsewhere, fifth-placed Espanyol fell to a 3-2 defeat at Valencia that left them seven points behind Villarreal.",Kylian Mbappe scores twice as Real Madrid beat Villarreal 2-0 in La Liga.

Widely regarded as one of Europe’s most gifted creative attackers, the 22-year-old Germany international arrived at Liverpool on the back of a standout spell in Bundesliga, where his freedom, intelligence and ability to control games marked him out as a generational talent.In the 29 games he's played at Liverpool across competitions, he's scored four goals and provided seven assists.Before the eventual move to the Merseyside, there was interest also from Bayern Munich. But Wirtz’s decision to embrace the Premier League underlines both his ambition and belief in Liverpool’s long-term vision.In this wide-ranging exclusive conversation with TimesofIndia.com, facilitated by JioStar, Wirtz reflects on the pull of Liverpool’s history, the challenge of meeting sky-high expectations, and the clarity provided by the manager’s plans for the team.Liverpool's immense stature as a club first and foremost. The team that clinched the Premier League last year. Above all, the manager's vision convinced me.Tactics aren't much different from the Bundesliga or Germany duty.In-game, it's the physicality I need to adapt to most.They've had many great midfielders. I just focus on giving my best on the pitch. I don't know what sets me apart—whether I do better or they did. I simply want to play my game and achieve success with the club.Probably the first Newcastle game. It was wildly intense — the early red card, endless long balls, two-footed tackles, everything. The crowd went berserk. That moment made me think, 'This league is different from the Bundesliga.’I don't measure success in specific terms. I focus on delivering my best performance wherever I am — at Liverpool or with the national team—to be vital for the squad and drive achievements. Trophies matter ultimately, as you tally them up, but right now, I prioritise winning them.",Florian Wirtz has had a tricky start to life at Anfield and in the Premier League.

Trump Booed Loudly As Miami Stadium Erupts During College Football Playoff

AI to help with planning itineraries

BENGALURU: For those who are preparing to pack their bags to watch the likes of Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, and Lamine Yamal in any of the 11 American cities that will host the World Cup 2026 matches, the Americans are determined to make it football’s best ever showpiece event. Awaiting the fans are fast-tracked visas and curated experiences, including road trips to explore the heart of the US, Route 66 being the most famous of them.The US joins Mexico and Canada to host the FIFA World Cup, the games in the US will begin with the hosts taking on Paraguay in a Group D match in Los Angeles on June 12, day after the tournament kicks off in Mexico City. That will set football (soccer for Americans) rolling across 11 cities for the next one month. The Americans, who put American football, baseball and basketball, above the world’s most popular sport are keen to make it the biggest ever spectacle for the millions of fans offering them an unbelievable time.“From New York to Miami to LA and Seattle, it’s quite a diverse list of host cities. I think each of the host cities are excited to put on a great show, and really engage their communities because it is very much about the communities that are hosting as well.The fan fests are going to be a great way to go beyond the stadium into the community. Local food, culture, music, and engaging with local communities as well. It’s hard to describe how exciting it’s going to be. I think it's going to be beyond any of our expectations,” Fred Dixon, president and CEO of Brand USA, told TOI in an exclusive interview.Speaking on the sidelines of the Brand USA Travel Week India held here, Dixon said the authorities also plan to make it easy for the spectators to get the US visa. “If you decide to buy tickets to the World Cup and you don’t have your visa yet, there actually is a way to facilitate that process to identify yourself as a ticket holder, and then the State Department will work to facilitate the visa processing faster for those travelers,” Dixon said.Dixon was particularly excited to welcome the Indians travelling for the World Cup. “In places like New Jersey and New York, places like Atlanta and Dallas, Texas, those are obviously big communities. The communities will come to life through the fan fests and so there will be the official fan fest events for every host city. So you'll be in the communities with the locals or with your friends and the people you're traveling with. With more than 5 million Indians living in the US, seeking out and traveling with or spending time with family and friends will be a big component of that,” Dixon said.On whether there will be any relaxation for the fans from Haiti and Iran, Dixon didn’t have an answer. “You’d have to check with the State Department,” he said.For those millions who get entry into the US and the special ones who get lucky through the draw, FIFA said there were 500 million requests for tickets to watch the matches, the US wanted to wow them. On top of the list are the road trips including the iconic Route 66.“It’s a unique moment as well because it’s the 250th anniversary of America. So you have America, 250 activities happening all across the country as well. The other anniversary that’s happening this year is Route 66. It's the 100th anniversary of the famous highway (opened on Nov 11, 1926) that connects California and Chicago -- from Chicago to Santa Monica. It winds through small, interesting towns all across the west of the US. And so you’re going to see a lot of themes around road trips, that freedom of the open road in America. So I think there will be a lot of curated experiences around road trips,” said Dixon.“In the host cities themselves, you’re going to have lots of curated experiences, whether it relates to museums, art, exhibitions. The travelers are going to benefit from the focus on a lot of Americana, both historical, but also what American brands, I think, have meant to the world. The Fleet Week, which is one of the big celebrations in New York every year in the harbour, has been moved from what is normally in late May. It’s now moving to July 4th. So just imagine the Statue of Liberty with fireworks and all the Navy fleets, you know. It’s expected to have the largest gathering of tall ships in the world for America 250, which will travel up the east coast of the US. So there is an unlimited amount of curated experiences to have,” Dixon added.“At americathebeautiful.com , we actually have AI integration to help with trip inspiration, particularly when you are dealing with an event that is multi-city, multi-date. We know what the group schedule will be, but as teams advance beyond the group, who’s going to the quarterfinals, who’s going to the semifinals, how would you route yourself? The itineraries may be dynamic if you’re following a particular team. And so our new website has an AI component built into it to help with itinerary suggestions and plannings and ideas.“You also can integrate what your passion points are. So if it’s culture, if it’s history and food, it will help give you highlights and ideas for how you can route yourself. It’s not a booking platform, but it's an inspiration platform. We’ve used AI in a way to help tap into really what is the best of America, and then to inspire travelers to travel, you know, far and to travel deep when they're in the US to explore the World cup, specifically,” Dixon signed off.","The US joins Mexico and Canada to host the FIFA World Cup.

Super Bowl LX uniform reveal: What Patriots, Seahawks will wear and why USA 250 patch matters



Super Bowl LX is almost here! With the season balanced on a single Sunday, New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks are putting finishing touches on their preparations in their home cities. The countdown is real, the stakes are massive, and every detail now feels amplified. That includes the jerseys that will take the field at Levi’s Stadium, where history, branding, and belief often collide under the brightest lights.Uniforms in the Super Bowl are never just cosmetic. They become symbols of identity, superstition, and momentum. On Thursday night, both teams pulled back the curtain, offering fans an early glimpse into how they will visually define their moment on football’s grandest stage.As the designated home team, the Patriots exercised first choice and settled on their all-white look. White jerseys paired with white pants reflect a season-long narrative New England has embraced with pride. The team has leaned into its road toughness all year, staying flawless away from Gillette Stadium. That perfect 9–0 mark has fueled confidence, and the Patriots clearly see no reason to abandon what has worked when everything is on the line.Seattle had fewer options, but no shortage of purpose. With alternate uniforms prohibited in the Super Bowl, the Seahawks will take the field in navy jerseys and navy pants. The single-tone look creates a sharp contrast against New England and reinforces the franchise’s no-frills, physical persona. It is a clean, bold presentation for a team comfortable letting its play do the talking.Beyond colors, Super Bowl LX uniforms carry added layers of meaning. Both teams will wear the Super Bowl LX logo along with a “USA 250” patch, tying the game into the national celebration of America’s semiquincentennial. The league has been honoring the milestone since Week 18, and the Super Bowl becomes its most visible stage yet.“The NFL is proud to participate in celebrating America's 250th anniversary,” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. “The story of the NFL reflects the story of America, and the American spirit of resilience, innovation and teamwork has helped football grow into a cultural pastime that unites us all. We are excited to honor our country's history and celebrate our collective future.”Seattle will also wear a special patch marking the franchise’s 50th season, while captains on both sides will display their traditional leadership badges. It is a reminder that the Super Bowl blends past and present, echoing moments like Super Bowl X, when teams wore bicentennial patches decades ago.When the Patriots and Seahawks kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET, the uniforms will already be telling a story. What follows will decide how that story is remembered.","New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks unveil their Super Bowl LX uniforms. Both teams will wear white jerseys and navy pants.

Sean McVay admits Rams’ biggest flaw after landing elite special teams coordinator,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/sean-mcvay-admits-rams-biggest-flaw-after-landing-elite-special-teams-coordinator/articleshow/127789353.cms,"Image via IMAGN

Rams fix a major special teams problem with the Bubba Ventrone hire

The Los Angeles Rams did not fall apart on offense or defense last season. They moved the ball well and stayed competitive in most games. The real damage came in the margins. Bad starting field position, shaky coverage units, and little impact in the return game kept putting extra pressure on both sides of the ball. Sean McVay saw it all year, and he finally said it out loud.That weak spot had a name. Special teams. And now the Rams have made a direct move to fix it with one of the most respected coaches in that phase.On January 30, 2026, ESPN insider Tom Pelissero reported news confirming that Los Angeles was serious about change.“The Rams have signed Bubba Ventrone as their new special teams coordinator, per sources. Special teams were a massive weakness last season for L.A., which now lands one of the NFL’s best.”That description matched the numbers. The Rams finished the 2025 season ranked near the bottom of the league in opponent average starting field position, regularly giving offenses shorter fields after kickoffs and punts. Their kick coverage unit allowed multiple returns past the 30-yard line, wiping out strong defensive series. The return game did not provide relief either, as Los Angeles rarely generated explosive runbacks to flip momentum.Those hidden yards added up fast. Sean McVay pointed to those field-position swings during his late-season media availability and made it clear the Rams needed new leadership on special teams heading into 2026.The Rams fired Chase Blackburn on December 20, 2025, after continued struggles. Assistant Ben Kotwica stepped in as interim coordinator to close the year, but the front office wanted a proven tone-setter. That search led to Bubba Ventrone.Bubba Ventrone built his NFL career on special teams excellence. He entered the league in 2005 from Villanova and carved out a long career with the Patriots, Jets, Browns, and 49ers. Coaches trusted him as a core team player, and teammates voted him Special Teams Player of the Year in 2014. He also served as special teams captain for multiple seasons, which shows the leadership he brings to the locker room.As a coach, Bubba Ventrone developed a reputation for disciplined units and strong situational awareness. His background in New England’s system helped shape that approach. Those details matter to Sean McVay, who wants consistency and accountability in a phase that cost the Rams too often in 2025.Los Angeles kept offensive continuity as well. Nate Scheelhaase remains on staff after the Browns hired Todd Monken. That allows Sean McVay to focus energy on rebuilding special teams without reshuffling the offense. Sean McVay called out the problem. Now the Rams have a coordinator whose whole career centres on fixing it.","The Los Angeles Rams hired Bubba Ventrone as their new special teams coordinator.

What is Jerry Jones’ net worth

What is Robert Kraft’s net worth

How NFL owners really make their money

Franchise value growth

Media and TV revenue sharing

Stadium-related businesses

Private investments outside football

NFL team owners are among the richest figures in global sports, and two of the most powerful names on that list are Jerry Jones and Robert Kraft. Both have shaped modern American football in very different ways, but their financial success places them in the same elite bracket. Here is a closer look at how their net worth compares.Jerry Jones is currently the wealthiest owner in the NFL, with an estimated net worth of around $13 billion . His fortune is closely tied to the Dallas Cowboys, the most valuable sports franchise in the world.He bought the Cowboys in 1989 for $140 million, for a deal that was widely questioned at the time. Today the franchise is valued at roughly $13 billion, making it a cornerstone of his wealth. Under his ownership the team won three Super Bowls in the 1990s and became a global brand.Beyond football, he built wealth through oil and gas ventures, real estate, and business investments. He also co-founded Legends Hospitality, which is a major sports and entertainment services company that operates stadiums, events, and premium experiences worldwide. His business skills helped transform the NFL into a commercial powerhouse.Robert Kraft’s estimated net worth stands at around $11 billion , placing him just behind Jones among NFL owners. Unlike Jones, Kraft was already extremely wealthy before buying an NFL team.The Kraft Group is a large commercial empire that makes money in several areas, including paper packaging, real estate, private equity, and manufacturing. In 1994, he bought the New England Patriots for $172 million, which was the most money ever paid for an NFL franchise.The Patriots won six Super Bowls with Bill Belichick and Tom Brady when he owned them, making them one of the most successful dynasties in sports history. Recent estimates put the franchise's worth at almost $9 billion, which is a huge increase.He also owns the New England Revolution (MLS) and is recognized for giving a lot of money to good causes, especially in education and health care.NFL owners don't just depend on franchise earnings. They usually get their money from:NFL teams make a lot of money every year, but the real financial victory is long-term franchise appreciation, which both Jones and Kraft have accomplished.Jerry Jones is ahead in the comparison because he has a bigger net worth, which is mostly due to the Cowboys' unequaled value. Robert Kraft is next, and he has a more varied business career outside of athletics.","Jerry Jones is currently the wealthiest owner in the NFL, with an estimated net worth of around $13 billion.

Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson spark engagement chatter after Hall of Fame rejection triggers unexpected personal twist



Bill Belichick's Hall of Fame snub has sparked disbelief across the NFL , and the shock still lingers inside the coach’s inner circle. For a man whose career rewrote football history, the silence following his exclusion has felt louder than any press conference. At 73, Belichick was expected to glide into Canton on his first try. Instead, the decision landed like a blindside hit, forcing him to confront a rare moment of professional rejection.Those close to him say the news cut deep at first. The disbelief came fast, then gave way to a familiar resolve shaped by decades in the league. He did not rage publicly. He reflected. While fans and analysts erupted, Belichick processed the setback privately, leaning on perspective earned through years of scrutiny, controversy, and relentless expectations.Friends, trying to lighten the mood, floated an idea that sounded half playful and half defiant. One source revealed, “Friends have joked that he should get engaged or married on the day of the Hall of Fame... that would easily steal away attention.” The timing would be August 8, the same date reserved for the Class of 2026 enshrinement. Yet the joke never crossed into reality. As the same source made clear, “But he wouldn't want to do it and that will remain a joke, because he has too much respect for those people and wouldn't be that petty.He wouldn't want to disrespect those who are actually getting inducted.”Belichick’s disappointment was real, but not consuming. “Simply put, he was shocked but then when it settled, it wasn't that much of a surprise because this is the NFL - he's been dealing with this kind of stuff for the last few years,” the source added. That outlook reflects a coach who understands how narratives, politics, and old controversies can sway opinions, even against a resume stacked with eight Super Bowl rings and 333 career wins.Jordon Hudson, his girlfriend, has taken the snub personally. Those close to the couple say she is struggling to stay quiet. “Jordon is trying very hard not to say anything, but it is very hard not to bring it up,” the source said. “They will deal with it their own way and will do something very tongue in cheek about it... that will be their answer.” Beneath the restraint sits frustration. “But she is upset... upset for Bill. It is all very dumb that he was snubbed.”Belichick himself summed up the disbelief in a private moment, asking an associate, “six Super Bowls isn't enough?” For now, the question hangs in the air, unanswered, as the league waits for its own verdict to age.",Bill Belichick's Hall of Fame snub has sparked disbelief across the NFL.

Joe Brady’s first Bills press conference turns heartfelt as he tearfully honors wife Lauren’s influence



Joe Brady stepped into his new role with the Buffalo Bills carrying more than a playbook. From the first moments of his introductory press conference, Joe Brady made it clear this chapter would be personal, emotional, and rooted in gratitude. The 36-year-old head coach did not chase headlines with bold promises. Instead, he centered the moment on sacrifice, family, and the unseen cost of chasing greatness in the NFL.The room felt heavier than a routine coaching introduction. Franchise quarterback Josh Allen arrived on crutches and in a walking boot, a quiet show of loyalty that spoke volumes. Buffalo, a team haunted by postseason heartbreak and decades of Super Bowl longing, turned the page after nine seasons under Sean McDermott. With Joe Brady now leading the charge, the Bills are betting on belief as much as strategy.Joe Brady’s journey to the top job has been steady, not rushed. He joined the Bills in 2022 as quarterbacks coach, then shaped the offense as coordinator for three seasons. Inside the building, his rise was earned through trust, clarity, and connection. That same tone defined his first day as head coach.When Brady spoke about the demands of the job, his voice cracked.Standing nearby was his wife, Lauren, whom he married in June 2022. What followed was not a rehearsed soundbite but a raw confession that cut through the noise of professional sports.“This job demands sacrifice, right? I’m calling you on the way to a game while you’re going into labor. I find out after the game, you’ve give birth by yourself. This game takes away time, energy, and presence from you.”The room fell silent as he continued.“And you’ve carried the weight that comes with this job so that I can pursue my calling. Your strength, your belief and your steadiness is the foundation that allows me to do what I do. You’ve believed me long before this moment has arrived. I’m nothing without you and I will never get anywhere in life without you.”The Bradys share two children, a son born in 2023 and a daughter welcomed in 2025. As Buffalo prepares to open the new Highmark Stadium this year, Brady is building more than a roster. He is building a culture grounded in loyalty, empathy, and accountability. For a franchise desperate for its first Super Bowl, that foundation may matter more than any scheme.","Joe Brady took over as head coach of the Buffalo Bills on Monday.

Kardashian Curse clouds Super Bowl LX buzz



Kardashian Curse talk has found its way into Super Bowl LX week, colliding with football history, celebrity culture, and a nervous internet that loves a good theory.Super Bowl LX already carries weight before a single snap. The New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks meet again on Feb. 8, reopening a chapter written 11 years ago when Tom Brady led New England to a narrow 28-24 win. Both teams arrive battle-tested, shaped by defense, discipline, and tight margins. Yet as game prep peaks, an unexpected storyline has slipped into the spotlight, one that has nothing to do with blitz packages or red zone calls.That storyline comes from Kendall Jenner, whose presence alone was enough to spark online panic. During a recent appearance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” Jenner openly debated which team to support. In a league driven by numbers and matchups, the moment felt harmless. On social media, it felt dangerous.The so-called Kardashian Curse has lingered online for years. The belief is simple and stubborn. Athletes linked to the family eventually hit turbulence. Kendall Jenner’s dating history has kept the theory alive, with NBA stars like Blake Griffin, Ben Simmons, and Devin Booker often cited by fans chasing patterns.The idea rarely fades. It just waits for its next target.That target may now be the Patriots. Jenner FaceTimed Brady on the show and asked for insight, saying, “So basically, I am trying to figure out who I want to go for the Super Bowl, and I am an information person. I feel like I need all the information I can get to make an educated decision. And I was thinking you're the perfect person to ask that information.”Brady leaned into the moment with humor and detail. “I hope I am,” he said, before breaking down Seattle’s defense, the impact of Nick Emmanwori, and why New England should not be counted out. “We got a whole two weeks to prepare for this. Who's going to win? I don't know.”Jenner chose the Patriots anyway. That single pick sent curse chatter into overdrive. Patriots owner Robert Kraft stepped in quickly with calm confidence. “Kendall, I just heard you put your money on us to win this big game. And you know what? I don't believe that thing about the Kardashian curse,” Kraft said. “We've been underdogs plenty of times and we've done OK. Let's do it together.”For a franchise built on belief and preparation, superstition holds little power. Still, if things swing late on Super Bowl Sunday, fans know exactly where the internet will point.",Kendall Jenner predicted the New England Patriots would win the Super Bowl. The idea of the Kardashian curse has lingered online for years. Patriots owner Robert Kraft said he doesn't believe in the curse.

Sean Mannion faces defining opportunity in Philadelphia



Sean Mannion steps into Philadelphia carrying both promise and pressure. The Eagles did not just fill a vacancy on Thursday night. They made a statement about direction, trust, and belief in development over reputation. After a season that drifted away from expectations, the franchise turned to a young coach shaped by modern offensive thinking rather than past glory.The decision signals urgency without panic. Philadelphia’s offense lost its rhythm when it mattered most, forcing Nick Sirianni to rethink leadership at the top of his scheme. By choosing Mannion, the Eagles embraced a reset rooted in teaching, structure, and adaptability. It is a bold move for a team still built to contend now, not later.Sean Mannion arrives as the fifth offensive coordinator under Sirianni, replacing Kevin Patullo after just one season. At 33, Mannion becomes one of the youngest coordinators in the league, and he does so without play-calling experience. That reality makes this hire risky, but also revealing. Sirianni did not chase a familiar name. He chose a coach he believes can grow alongside the roster.Mannion’s rise has been rapid. After retiring as a player in 2023, he joined Green Bay’s staff as an offensive assistant in 2024. Within a year, he was trusted to take over as quarterbacks coach following Tom Clements’ retirement. That promotion placed him directly inside Matt LaFleur’s system, one known for timing, motion, and quarterback-friendly reads.His playing career quietly prepared him for this role. Drafted by the Rams in the third round in 2015, Mannion spent nine seasons absorbing offenses from the sideline and the meeting room. Stops with the Vikings and Seahawks expanded his exposure to the Shanahan coaching tree, learning under minds like Sean McVay, Kevin O’Connell, and Zac Taylor. Few first-time coordinators enter the role with that range of influence.Philadelphia needs clarity more than creativity. The Eagles ranked 19th in scoring and 24th in total offense last season, their lowest marks under Sirianni. Mannion’s task is not to reinvent the offense, but to stabilize it. If he can translate his teaching background into clear decisions on game day, this gamble could quietly reshape the Eagles’ future.","Sean Mannion becomes one of the youngest coordinators in the league. The 33-year-old has no play-calling experience. Mannion replaces Kevin Patullo after just one season. The Eagles ranked 19th in scoring and 24th in total offense last season, their lowest marks under Sirianni.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127788272,imgsize-85534,width-400,resizemode-4/sean-mannion.jpg"

Is LeBron James retiring this season?

Cleveland’s tribute to LeBron James extends retirement hype



Being arguably the best in a sport is no easy task to maintain with consistency for decades, and LeBron James has proved that he has been at the top of the league. However, all things come to an end. At 41, the veteran Lakers star has been doing things that appear to signal his potential retirement, perhaps by the end of the season. Recently, James gifted his mom, Gloria, a Lakers jersey with a heartfelt note thanking her for everything she did for him to become the man he is today.It was not the first; his former team Cleveland Cavaliers have celebrated his legacy on the jumbotron at their home as the Lakers superstar returned to face the blowout defeat. But the moment felt heavy as everyone in the arena honored him with a standing ovation. LeBron also wiped his wet years with his jersey and a towel. So is this the end of his legendary career?LeBron James has avoided firm statements about retirement, even as speculation grows. After the loss in Cleveland, he addressed the idea of a farewell tour and made it clear that no final decision exists yet. He explained that those conversations have not happened with his family, and any evaluation would come after the season.“I'll go out and play at a high level...I have not even thought to the point of like a farewell tour or whatever the case may be because I haven't had that conversation with myself and my family on when it's over,” James said.He also acknowledged how unexpected his longevity has been. “8 years ago when I left to go to LA if you would have asked would I still be playing in 2026 I would have said no. After going to 8 straight finals and with all the energy and all the mental toll and the physical toll that it took on me and obviously my teammates...there's no way I could of foresee that. Couple more years, yeah.”Still, his free agency status after the season adds weight to every appearance.Following the game, James shared a private moment. He presented his mother, Gloria, with a signed Lakers jersey and a handwritten message that showed gratitude.“To Mama James, Love you with all my heart & more. Thank you for everything and beyond YOU'RE INCREDIBLE ♥️ #TheRealMVP”Later, James spoke about the significance of the moment as Gloria watched both her son and grandson share the NBA floor.“My mom gets to watch her son and her grandson play in the NBA at the same time,” James said. “I actually just started to think about how insane that is. Yeah, that's awesome.”Cleveland honored James with a tribute video celebrating his historic past, including his iconic 2007 playoff performance. The scene overwhelmed him. He sat on the bench, wiping away tears as the crowd rose in appreciation.James finished with 11 points and five assists in what may have been his final game in the city. Whether or not that proves true, the moment carried the feel of reflection. For now, James remains focused on the present.","Lakers star LeBron James has been doing things that appear to signal his potential retirement.

NBA Slam Dunk Contest gains a hometown headliner



NBA Slam Dunk Contest welcomes Spurs rookie Carter Bryant



The NBA Slam Dunk Contest has its first confirmed names, and one of them will perform in front of a home crowd. Los Angeles Lakers center Jaxson Hayes and San Antonio Spurs rookie Carter Bryant have accepted invitations to compete during All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles. The event will take place at the Intuit Dome, with the dunk contest scheduled for Feb. 14 as part of the Feb. 13–15 festivities.The announcement adds early clarity to a Saturday night showcase that has searched for fresh energy in recent years. With three-time defending champion Mac McClung reportedly opting out, the 2026 field opens without a reigning favorite. The absence creates space for new faces, new styles, and a different narrative to take shape on one of the league’s biggest stages.Jaxson Hayes enters the NBA Slam Dunk Contest after drawing attention for an in-game between-the-legs dunk against the Chicago Bulls earlier this week. The 7-footer has long been known for his vertical pop, and his recent Eastbay finish brought renewed focus to his athletic range. After that performance, Hayes explained how the move became part of his arsenal.“I mean, I’ve done it a few times in an NBA game before,” Hayes said.“Really, I just started doing it my sophomore year. You’re a kid, you’re in the garage, in the driveway on like the small hoop and you just try a bunch of dunks. I remember just trying it in like middle school and stuff and then I got to like my sophomore year, junior year of high school when I was actually dunking and I was like, let me try it real quick and got it. So now I’ve just been doing it.”Hayes has recorded 64 dunks through 38 games this season after finishing with a career-high 120 last year. He will become the seventh player in Lakers history to participate in the contest, joining names that include Kobe Bryant, Shannon Brown, Larry Nance Jr., and Dwight Howard. Bryant remains the only Laker to win the event.Bryant, the 14th overall pick in last year’s draft, represents a different profile. The 6-foot-6 rookie is averaging 2.5 points across 35 games for San Antonio, though his selection speaks more to upside and athletic promise than box score production. His inclusion makes him the only confirmed Spurs participant so far.“Los Angeles Lakers center Jaxson Hayes and San Antonio Spurs rookie Carter Bryant have accepted invitations to the 2026 NBA Slam Dunk Contest at All-Star weekend in L.A., sources tell ESPN,” Shams Charania wrote on X.Without McClung in the mix, the NBA Slam Dunk Contest will crown a new winner.

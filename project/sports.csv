New Zealand Cricket has secured a major boost ahead of next year’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, with five of the country’s top white-ball players signing casual playing contracts. Finn Allen Tim Seifert , and Kane Williamson have all committed to representing the Black Caps at the 2026 T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, as well as in a set number of series and games leading up to the tournament.The casual contracts mean the players will receive the same support and services as those on full-time deals, ensuring they are fully prepared for the challenges ahead. While all will be available for selection in the upcoming T20I series against Australia, England, and the West Indies, Williamson has chosen to sit out the series against the Aussies.NZC CEO Scott Weenink said locking in the stars was a crucial step with the T20 World Cup less than six months away. “With such a pinnacle event on the horizon, we wanted to ensure our best T20 players were ready and available to push for inclusion,” he said.Weenink added that the casual contracts are a two-way commitment. “The players have shown that representing the Black Caps is hugely important to them. In return, NZC will offer full support as part of our high-performance system,” he said.He also expressed excitement about the months ahead. “Rob [New Zealand coach Rob Walter] and the team have a massive period of cricket coming up, both home and away, and I know our fans can’t wait to follow and support them,” he added.The move ensures that New Zealand will enter next year’s T20 World Cup with its top talent in place, ready to take on the world’s best in what promises to be a thrilling tournament.","New Zealand Cricket has secured a major boost ahead of next year's ICC Men's T20 World Cup.

Mohsin Naqvi tweet

Mohsin Naqvi, Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board and the Asian Cricket Council, sparked debate on social media after calling India’s decision not to shake hands with Pakistan “utterly disappointing.” In his tweet, Naqvi said dragging politics into cricket goes against the very spirit of the game and hoped future victories would be celebrated with grace by all teams.The tweet came after India thrashed Pakistan by seven wickets in Group A, chasing down 128 in just 15.5 overs. India captain Suryakumar Yadav remained unbeaten on 47, while Shivam Dube added 10 not out. Earlier, Kuldeep Yadav led the spin attack with 3-18, supported by Axar Patel (2-18) and Varun Chakaravarthy (1-24), as Pakistan were restricted to 127-9.The match carried heightened emotions, being the first between the arch-rivals since May’s cross-border tensions following the Pahalgam terror attack in April, which killed 26 people. India’s team decided to go ahead with the match in alignment with the government and the Board of Control for Cricket in India.Suryakumar Yadav defended the team’s stance after the win. “We are aligned with the government and the BCCI ,” he said. “We wanted to dedicate this victory to our brave armed forces, who have shown immense valour. This decision reflected that support and our solidarity with the victims and their families.”The match was tense from the start. Captains Suryakumar Yadav and Salman Ali Agha skipped the customary handshake at the toss, and after India sealed the win, the players walked straight into their dressing room without shaking hands.Pakistan, in protest, refused to attend the post-match ceremony.Pakistan’s head coach Mike Hesson expressed disappointment at the snub. “We were ready to shake hands. Disappointed the opposition didn’t do that,” he said, while clarifying that captain Salman Ali Agha not attending the presentation was “just in the flow of things.”Despite the controversy, India’s dominance on the field was clear. The spin trio of Kuldeep, Axar, and Varun controlled the game on a slow Dubai pitch, while Suryakumar’s calm and composed innings ensured a smooth chase. With this win, India remain on top of Group A and are nearly through to the Super Fours stage, with their final group match against Oman on Friday.","India thrashed Pakistan by seven wickets in Group A of the Asia Cup.

Shubman Gill injury update, who came for optional nets and mood before Pakistan match

NEW DELHI: An emotionally charged Asia Cup clash in Dubai on Sunday saw India cruise to a seven-wicket victory over arch-rivals Pakistan, but the match carried meaning far beyond the scoreboard. Vice-captain Shubman Gill’s heartfelt social media post dedicating the win to the victims of the April Pahalgam attack and India’s armed forces became the defining note of the night.“Today’s win is dedicated to the victims of Pahalgam and to our brave armed forces who continue to safeguard us. The spirit of India lives on both on and off the field. Jai Hind,” Gill wrote on Instagram, posting pictures of the Indian team in a huddle and other celebratory images from the match. His words struck a chord with fans back home, underscoring the tense backdrop against which the neighbours resumed cricketing hostilities.The two sides were meeting for the first time since a deadly military conflict in May, triggered by the Pahalgam incident in Kashmir.On the field, spinners set the tone for India’s dominance. Kuldeep Yadav starred with figures of 3-18, while Axar Patel chipped in with 2-18 to restrict Pakistan to 127/9.Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah struck early, and only Sahibzada Farhan (40) and Shaheen Shah Afridi’s late blitz (33 not out off 16) offered resistance.India’s chase began in fiery fashion with Abhishek Sharma smashing 31 off 13 balls, including a four and a six off Afridi. Though Gill fell early, Abhishek’s aggression and a composed 56-run stand between skipper Suryakumar Yadav (47* off 37) and Tilak Varma (31) sealed the chase with 25 balls to spare. Yadav finished the match in style with a towering six.Yet, post-match scenes overshadowed celebrations as Indian players walked off without the customary handshake. Asked about the snub, captain Yadav was categorical: “The team were aligned with the government and Board of Control for Cricket in India in not shaking hands with the Pakistan team.”India, with two wins from two, are virtually through to the Super Fours stage, while Pakistan face hosts UAE in their final group game.",India beat Pakistan by seven wickets in Asia Cup clash in Dubai.

Suryakumar Yadav on no handshake with Pakistan: 'Some things in life are ahead of sportsmanship'

Poll What do you think was the key factor in India's victory over Pakistan? Strong bowling performance Suryakumar Yadav's leadership Batting depth of the team

: India captain Suryakumar Yadav hit the winning runs on Sunday as the defending Asia Cup champions pulled off a comfortable win over Paksitan in the heavily anticipated Group A clash.Following his side's second consecutive win in the competition, the 35-year-old stated that his team’s focus remained strictly on cricket after they skipped the traditional post-match handshakes with Pakistan players in Dubai.“We took a call. We came here just to play the game,” Suryakumar told reporters when asked about the decision that drew attention after India’s emphatic seven-wicket win.Posed with the question of the hour - as to why Team India did not shake hands with the opposition, he replied, ""Few things in life are ahead of sportsman spirit also.""The skipper also weighed in on the toss, after Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha opted to bat on a dry surface. “I also wanted to bowl first. In the second innings in last match against UAE, the wicket became better. We also wanted to bowl,” he said.India’s bowlers justified that decision, as they managed to restrict their rivals to 127/9. With just one lead pacer in their XI, the spin trio of Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel and Varun Chakaravarthy dismantled Pakistan’s batting.The three combined for six wickets to leave the opposition struggling for runs.Suryakumar praised their effort, saying, “They bowled 12 overs. All three of them have worked really hard. They were clear with their plans. Good to see all the three spinners firing.”Pakistan’s innings never really recovered after early blows from Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah. Sahibzada Farhan led the scoring for his side with 40, while Shaheen Shah Afridi’s late cameo of 33 not out pushed the total into three figures.On Pakistan’s weakness in the game, Suryakumar observed, “We bowled well and batted as per the demand of the wicket.”In reply, India chased down the target in 15.5 overs. Abhishek Sharma’s 31 off 13 balls set the tone before Suryakumar himself anchored the innings with an unbeaten 47, closing out the game with a six. Tilak Varma contributed 31 in a steady stand with his captain.Asked about handling the noise around such a charged contest, the skipper said the squad had kept distractions away. “In my team, we decided to cut the outside noise. I don’t know what is happening on the social media,” he said after the match.With the win, India solidified their place at the top of Group A, while Pakistan were left to regroup for their next outing against hosts United Arab Emirates.","India beat Pakistan by seven wickets in Group A clash in Dubai.

Mike Hesson on India's handshake snub: 'We were disappointed that our opposition didn't do that'

Brief scores: Pakistan: 127/9 in 20 overs (Farhan 40, Shaheen 33*; Kuldeep 3/18, Axar 2/18); India: 131/3 in 15.5 overs (Suryakumar 47*, Abhishek 31, Tilak 31; Ayub 3/35).

India’s commanding seven-wicket victory over Pakistan in the Asia Cup Group A clash on Sunday was overshadowed by a post-match controversy, with Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson expressing disappointment over India’s refusal to engage in the customary handshake.“We were ready to shake hands, disappointed opposition didn’t do that,” Hesson said after the game, adding that Pakistan had expected the traditional show of respect regardless of the result.Chasing 128, skipper Suryakumar Yadav (47 not out off 37) and Shivam Dube closed out the win in 15.5 overs at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.But instead of greeting their opponents, the Indian pair walked straight to the dressing room.Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha and Hesson later approached the Indian camp, only to find no players available. Hesson looked visibly upset at the snub, which followed a similar incident at the toss when the captains declined to shake hands.Earlier, Suryakumar struck the winning runs on his 35th birthday and later dedicated the victory to India’s armed forces.“We stand by the victims of the families of Pahalgam terror attack.We express our solidarity. We want to dedicate the win to all our armed forces who showed a lot of bravery,” he said, earning loud applause from the crowd.On the field, India’s spinners dominated proceedings after Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah rattled Pakistan’s top order. Kuldeep Yadav (3/18) and Axar Patel (2/18) tied down the middle order, leaving only Sahibzada Farhan (40 off 44) and Shaheen Afridi (33 not out off 16) to offer resistance in Pakistan’s total of 127/9.India replied with authority, Abhishek Sharma blazing 31 off 13 and Tilak Varma adding 31 off 31 before Suryakumar finished in style.The no-handshake drama, coupled with an anthem mix-up before the start, added another fiery chapter to the storied rivalry.

Manchester City cruised to a commanding 3-0 victory over rivals Manchester United on Sunday, with Erling Haaland scoring twice after Phil Foden’s opener at the Etihad Stadium.The result handed Pep Guardiola’s side a timely lift after back-to-back league defeats, while piling more pressure on United manager Ruben Amorim, whose team have now taken just four points from their first four games.City began strongly and made the breakthrough inside 20 minutes. Jeremy Doku’s persistence on the left allowed his cross to find an unmarked Foden to head home.After the restart, Haaland extended the advantage in trademark fashion, racing clear before lifting the ball calmly over Altay Bayindir. Moments later, the Norwegian spurned an open-goal chance when he rounded the goalkeeper but struck the post, keeping United faintly in the contest.Any hopes of a response were dashed by a standout moment from debutant Gianluigi Donnarumma, who clawed away Bryan Mbeumo’s volley at full stretch to preserve City’s two-goal cushion. Minutes later, Harry Maguire’s misplaced pass allowed Bernardo Silva to release Haaland, who finished emphatically to seal the points.The win keeps City six points behind leaders Liverpool but restores momentum ahead of a demanding week featuring fixtures against Napoli and Arsenal. For United, it was another disappointing derby day, with fans audibly expressing their frustration towards Amorim as chants of “sacked in the morning” echoed from the away section.The occasion was preceded by a solemn moment as both sets of supporters paid tribute to boxing great Ricky Hatton, who passed away earlier on Sunday.

Real Madrid secured a 2-1 victory against Real Sociedad in Saturday's Spanish league match, led by Kylian Mbappé who scored one goal and assisted another, despite playing with 10 men for nearly an hour. Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid earned its first season win before their Champions League clash with Liverpool, and Athletic Bilbao suffered a defeat ahead of hosting Arsenal.Mbappé demonstrated his scoring prowess in the 12th minute, capitalizing on a poor Sociedad pass to score his fourth goal of the season.

When is the Barcelona vs Valencia match?



Where will the match be played?



Barcelona return to La Liga action on Sunday against Valencia, but their first home fixture of the season will not be played at Camp Nou. The Catalan club is still waiting on permits to reopen its renovated stadium and will instead use the 6,000-capacity Estadi Johan Cruyff, normally reserved for the women’s and youth teams.Club president Joan Laporta addressed the situation earlier this week, saying: “We will be back to the Camp Nou as soon as possible.” Until then, Barcelona must adapt to life in a far smaller venue.Coach Hansi Flick also faces a selection headache. Frenkie de Jong, Alejandro Balde and Gavi remain unavailable through injury, with De Jong’s setback occurring while on international duty with the Netherlands. Goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen continues to be sidelined as well, reducing Flick’s options further.Furthermore, Lamine Yamal will also play no part in the game owing to injuries sustained while on duty for Spain.Despite the off-field and fitness concerns, Barcelona remain unbeaten and will look to maintain their strong start under Flick. Valencia, meanwhile, arrive in search of an upset that could shift early-season momentum.The fixture marks the first major test of how Barcelona manage both reduced squad depth and the unusual circumstances of playing without their iconic stadium.With young talents like Lamine Yamal stepping up in attack, the champions will aim to keep pace with early leaders Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao.- The matchday 2 fixture will be streamed live on the FanCode app and website.- There will be no live broadcast in India for the 2025/26 La Liga season.The matchday 4 clash between Valencia and Barca will kick off on Sunday, September 14 (Monday, September 15 in India) at 9:00 PM Local time (12:30 AM IST).The match between Valencia and Barcelona will not be played at Camp Nou. Rather, the game will take place at the Estadi Johan Cruyff in Sant Joan Despi, Spain.","Barcelona face Valencia at the Estadi Johan Cruyff in Sant Joan Despi.

New Delhi: Naushad Moosa has taken a break. After the India U-23 coach failed to make the grade in the AFC U-23 Asian Cup 2026 Qualifiers, the former India international defender stayed back in Doha to spend a couple of days with friends.The Qatari capital was bombed on Tuesday, a day after India narrowly lost to the hosts. Was it safe for him to stay back? Moosa told TOI, “It created some panic that night but things settled down after that.”His team’s performance in the three Doha qualifiers made the people back home sit up and take notice. The social media was full of clips showing Muhammed Suhail's impressive solo effort for the opening strike.Naushad Moosa’s boys finished fifth among the eleven second-placed teams, just one spot behind the qualification places. They won against Bahrain (2-0), drubbed Brunei 6-0 and narrowly lost to hosts Qatar 2-1.“Agreed there is lot to cheer about the U-23 boys’ display, but what concerns me is, what next? Most of them will warm the bench when they go back to their clubs. They won’t get much game time. They end up playing developmental games,” pointed out Moosa.“This lack of continuity has been a major problem for us,” he continued, “These boys need to play consistently at the senior level now.They are good enough for senior India too.”Moosa said he has related this issue with the AIFF too and can only hope it can be addressed. Moosa’s strong message to the young players is to find clubs where they can get playing time.For now, Moosa will return to Guwahati to join NorthEast United, where he is part of the coaching staff. Praising his boys for their adventurous display, Moosa said that Suhail, the most talked about youngster currently, should remain focused.“These boys should concentrate on the game but for that they have to be kept engaged with competitive games.”","Naushad Moosa's boys finished fifth among the eleven second-placed teams.

Real Madrid’s defensive plans have taken a hit as centre-back Antonio Rudiger faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines following a muscle injury in his left leg. The German international, 32, suffered the setback during training on Friday, and early reports suggest he could be out for around two months.The club confirmed in a statement that scans revealed an injury to Rudiger’s rectus femoris muscle. While Real Madrid did not provide an exact recovery timeline, Spanish outlet AS described the injury as “serious.” The veteran defender has only featured once in La Liga this season, after managing 55 appearances for the club last year despite battling through injuries.Rudiger’s absence leaves Real with limited options at centre-back, though the club strengthened the position this summer by signing 20-year-old Dean Huijsen from Bournemouth. Reports also suggest that Real Madrid are keeping an eye on Liverpool’s France international Ibrahima Konaté, potentially as reinforcement at the end of the season.The Spanish champions face a busy schedule ahead, with a La Liga trip to Real Sociedad on Saturday followed by their Champions League opener against Marseille on Tuesday. Manager Carlo Ancelotti will be forced to reshuffle his defensive lineup in the absence of Rüdiger.Meanwhile, Jude Bellingham, who has been managing a shoulder injury, has opted for surgery following his Club World Cup commitments. The England midfielder has now begun rehabilitation, with Real Madrid hopeful of seeing him return later this season.With Rudiger sidelined and Bellingham recovering, Real Madrid will need to rely on squad depth as they juggle domestic and European challenges in the opening months of the campaign.",Antonio Rudiger faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines with a muscle injury.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

India secured a historic spot in the Davis Cup Qualifiers after Sumit Nagal defeated young Henry Bernet in the first reverse singles, leading to a 3-1 victory over Switzerland in the World Group I tie on Saturday.The day began with N Sriram Balaji and Rithvik Bollipalli suffering a close defeat in the doubles rubber against Jakub Paul and Dominic Stricker, with scores of 7-6 (3) 4-6 5-7 in a match lasting two hours and 26 minutes.The Swiss team made a strategic change by fielding junior Australian Open champion Bernet instead of Jerome Kym for the crucial fourth rubber against Nagal, which the Indian won convincingly with scores of 6-1 6-3.India entered the day with a 2-0 lead following impressive singles victories by Nagal and newcomer Dhakshineshwar Suresh on Friday.This victory marks India's first triumph over a European team in an away tie since their win against France in the 1993 quarterfinals, led by Leander Paes and Ramesh Krishnan.India's previous European success came against Denmark in a home tie played on grass courts in Delhi in 2022.The first round of Davis Cup Qualifiers is scheduled for January 2026.Bernet's aggressive playing style resulted in numerous unforced errors, which worked in favor of the Indian player.""It means a lot. It's been a while that we won in Europe. We worked very hard to be here. We pushed each other, I am very happy with the win,"" said Nagal.""Doubles was tough, the level of tennis was very high from both teams. I was sweating more on the sidelines than playing this match. The young ones are always tricky, you don't know what's coming your way.""This was Nagal's return to Davis Cup competition since his last appearance against Morocco in September 2023, and his presence proved influential.The victory represents captain Rohit Rajpal's first significant achievement since taking over from Mahesh Bhupathi in 2019, particularly notable for being won on foreign soil.The 18-year-old Bernet started slowly, losing his serve in the opening game, but later showed promise with his single-handed backhand producing impressive corner winners.Nagal gained a crucial break point when Bernet failed to execute a half volley at 30-all while approaching the net, giving the Indian player a 4-1 advantage.The first set concluded with Bernet committing a double fault on set point, which came after a forehand error.Nagal maintained his momentum in the second set, securing an early break and maintaining the advantage until victory was sealed with Bernet's return going long.In the earlier doubles match, both Balaji and Stricker demonstrated excellent serving skills initially, holding their serves without dropping points.The Indians challenged Paul's serve but the Swiss player managed to hold after reaching deuce.The Indian pair earned three break points on Stricker's serve in the sixth game, converting the third opportunity when Stricker hit the net following an extended baseline rally with Balaji.The Swiss team recovered by breaking back when serving for the first set, capitalizing on Balaji's forehand return error at 30-all.The tiebreaker remained close at 3-3 before Paul's consecutive errors gave India the advantage.The second set remained competitive with both teams level at 4-4 after navigating through challenging moments.Despite having opportunities, including a crucial break point chance at 30-all in the ninth game, Balaji couldn't capitalize on them.The teams engaged in an intense six-deuce game, which Paul eventually won when Balaji's return went long.Bollipalli lost his serve in the following game, leveling the match at one set each.An early break put India in a favorable position, but Bollipalli faced pressure and needed three aces on deuce points to hold serve.Stricker earned a break back opportunity with a service return winner on Balaji's serve, which was converted following a double fault.The match concluded when Bollipalli, serving to stay in contention, started with a double fault and backhand error, followed by Paul's forehand winner setting up three match points, with victory secured on Bollipalli's netted return.",India beat Switzerland 3-1 in Davis Cup World Group I tie on Saturday.

It proved to be a happy tale of a debutant and the return of a prodigal son as a reinvigorated India took a decisive 2-0 lead after the opening day's singles in the World Group I tie against Switzerland in Biel on Friday.Dhakshineswar Suresh , promoted from reserve, delivered a stunning performance to beat World No. 155 Jerome Kym 7-6 (5), 6-3 and put India ahead before Sumit Nagal stepped up to double the lead at the Swiss Tennis Arena, located on Roger Federer Allee.The 28-year-old Nagal skipped the previous three ties, most controversially the World Group I tie last year against Sweden, which India lost 0-4. But the former World No. 68 showed none of the bitterness as he put on a professional display to tame southpaw Marc-Andrea Huesler 6-3, 7-6 (4).India faltered six times at this stage of the team competition since 2021. Now, they are one match win away from advancing to the Qualifiers next year.Suresh is three years older and, at 621, ranked 466 rungs lower than the home favourite. The Indian, standing 6 ft 5 in, proved to be a little more solid. Not only did he win more points on his first and second serves, the Indian unleashed his weapon when it mattered the most, averting seven breakpoints. On the other hand, Kym failed to keep his nerve.","Dhakshineswar Suresh delivered a stunning performance to beat World No. 155 Jerome Kym 7-6 (5), 6-3 and put India ahead.

A year ago, captain Rohit Rajpal made a conservative choice to field Sriram Balaji, the senior most player in the Indian team, in the singles against Sweden in a World Group I tie in Stockholm. The team was depleted in the absence of leading singles player Sumit Nagal but with Balaji being a doubles specialist, Rajpal had to cop criticism for failing to use the opportunity to blood a young Aryan Shah.Twelve months later, the captain has shown a leap of faith by picking a player, orignially named in the reserve, ahead of two higher-ranked players in the squad. On Thursday, Rajpal nominated Dhakshineswar Suresh , who plays for Wake Forest University in the US college tennis and had made rapid strides in recent months, along with Nagal in singles in the tie against Switzerland in Biel.Suresh, a 25-year-old big serving 6’-5” tall lad from the tempel town of Madurai in Tamil Nadu, was drawn to play Jerome Kym in the opening singles followed by Nagal against Marc-Andrea Huesler at the Swiss Tennis Arena in Biel on Friday. Kym is ranked 155th in the singles charts while Huesler is 222nd.Ironically, Suresh’s Cup debut will come at the cost of 19-year-old Shah, the second highest-ranked India at the moment at 401 in the ATP computer.The teenager had been unwell last week and that may have been a factor in Rajpal’s choice.Also returning to the Davis Cup fold along with Nagal is Bhambri, but the World No. 35 (in doubles) has been sidelined by a heel injury he suffered during his semifinal run with New Zealand’s Michael Venus at the US Open. He has been replaced by Rithvik Chaudary Bollipalli, who will pair up with Balaji in the doubles rubber against Jakub Paul and Dominic Stricker on Saturday.Nagal will face Kym in the first reverse singles followed by Suresh against Husler, subject to nominations remaining unchanged.The 28-year-old Nagal has slipped in rankings to 290 and has played primarily on clay, his most favoured surface, since losing in the first round of qualifying at Wimbledon, whereas the tie will be played on indoor hard. Whether the bounce and pace suits the former world No. 68 remains to be seen. Given the circumstances, the spotlight will be firmly on 621st ranked Suresh, who has done well in singles and doubles.","A year ago, captain Rohit Rajpal made a conservative choice to field Sriram Balaji, the senior most player in the Indian team, in the singles against Sweden in a World Group I tie in Stockholm.

Patrick Mouratoglou reveals 'fights' with Serena Williams over weight: 'She felt judged',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/patrick-mouratoglou-its-not-about-looks-its-about-tennis-on-serena-williams-comeback/articleshow/123841327.cms,"Patrick Mouratoglou with Serena Williams (X-Tennis Letter)

Patrick Mouratoglou, the acclaimed French tennis coach, spoke to The Guardian about his experiences with some of the sport’s biggest names, including Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, and the challenges posed by rising stars Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.Mouratoglou first gained international attention guiding Marcos Baghdatis to the 2006 Australian Open final, but it was his partnership with Serena Williams that truly cemented his reputation. Together, they won 10 of her 23 Grand Slam singles titles. Reflecting on their collaboration, Mouratoglou told The Guardian that their success was built on mutual trust and motivation.“We had big trust on both sides. I knew how to motivate her, how to provoke her to be more competitive,” he said. Their partnership began during a tough period for Serena, who had suffered a first-round loss at the 2012 French Open , her first ever early exit at a Grand Slam.To rebuild her confidence, Mouratoglou and Serena developed creative strategies. For instance, ahead of Roland Garros, he instructed her to serve only second serves during the Madrid warm-up to make her work for every point. The approach forced her to stay fully focused and build confidence on clay, helping her achieve a remarkable 28-0 record that year.Mouratoglou also discussed Serena’s post-pregnancy fitness journey.He explained that tennis demands precise physical efficiency. “Even one kilo can make a difference. Tennis involves sudden direction changes at high speed, and every fraction of a second counts. I told her this isn’t about how she looks; it’s about her performance. Her movement was affected, and for her to return to the top, she needed to be as efficient as possible. ”He acknowledged the challenges of age and recovery. “Serena was older, and the body doesn’t bounce back the same. The risk of injury is higher. We had a few disagreements because she felt judged. But my focus was on her tennis, not her appearance. If she wanted to make history again, we had to be very efficient on every level, including this.”Turning to the current men’s game, Mouratoglou addressed the dominance of Alcaraz and Sinner. He compared it to the Federer-Nadal era, noting that players who believe they can break through are the ones who succeed, citing Novak Djokovic as an example.On Naomi Osaka, Mouratoglou explained that their partnership ended after 10 months because, despite her strong practice and mindset, match results were inconsistent. “She needed to feel lighter on court to express her tennis freely. There are no hard feelings. She’s an incredible competitor, and seeing her regain top form is fantastic for women’s tennis.”Mouratoglou’s reflections offer a rare insight into the strategy, psychology, and attention to detail that define champions, showing that success in tennis is as much about mental and physical efficiency as it is about talent.","Patrick Mouratoglou, the acclaimed French tennis coach, spoke to The Guardian about his experiences with Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, and the challenges posed by rising stars Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.

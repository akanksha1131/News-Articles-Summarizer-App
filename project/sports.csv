Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Poll Who should take the lead in negotiations with the ICC? Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Bangladesh government Players' representatives All of them together

ICC's media release after the meet on Wednesday:

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh’s participation in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 in India hung by a thread on Wednesday after the International Cricket Council (ICC) formally rejected the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s (BCB) request to relocate their matches to Sri Lanka, triggering an urgent round of talks involving the government, players and cricket administrators.Amid the escalating uncertainty, Bangladesh government’s sports advisor Asif Nazrul will meet the national cricketers on Thursday (January 21) at Hotel InterContinental in Dhaka. As per a Cricbuzz report, the meeting, scheduled for 3 pm, is aimed at briefing players on the latest developments and hearing their views after it emerged that the squad was not consulted during the initial standoff. T20I captain Litton Kumar Das had earlier admitted that players’ consent was not taken as doubts grew over Bangladesh’s World Cup participation.The ICC’s decision came after a board meeting that lasted nearly an hour and a half, during which Bangladesh’s proposal was put to vote. According to reports, all but two members voted against Bangladesh’s plea. Even a last-minute show of support from the Pakistan Cricket Board failed to shift the balance.“I am hoping for a miracle from the ICC. Who doesn’t want to play the World Cup?” BCB president Aminul Islam said. “We explained to the ICC board the reasons for our decision before the voting began. We didn’t want to go into voting. We stepped back.”Following the rejection, the ICC issued what effectively amounts to an ultimatum. Bangladesh have been given 24 hours to confirm whether they will travel to India for the tournament, scheduled from February 7 to March 8. Failure to comply will see them replaced, with Scotland tipped to take Bangladesh’s place in Group C.“The Bangladesh players want to play the World Cup. The Bangladesh government wants Bangladesh to play the World Cup. But we don’t think India is safe for our players,” Aminul said. He revealed that the BCB proposed shifting matches to Sri Lanka or even swapping groups with Ireland or Zimbabwe. “It would have been the easiest way. But Sri Lanka said that we don’t want a new team in our group.”Aminul added that after the vote, he sought more time to consult the government. “I told them that I want one last chance to tell my government. They said it’s a valid point, and gave me 24 or 48 hours to get back to them.”Despite the setback, the BCB has not entirely shut the door on negotiations. Another senior official said the ICC could still have a change of heart.",Bangladesh's participation in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026 in India hung by a thread on Wednesday.

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: On India T20I Playing XI, personal form and more

NEW DELHI: Dashing opener Abhishek Sharma said he does not believe in range-hitting and instead relies on his instincts and timing, underlining the importance of adapting to conditions after playing a decisive role in India’s opening T20I win against New Zealand here on Wednesday. The 25-year-old smashed a breathtaking 35-ball 84, featuring eight sixes and five fours, as India posted an imposing 238 for seven before sealing a 48-run victory in the series opener.""We had a plan from day one and are just following it. I've figured out if you want to hit all balls or strike at 200, you have to carry intent. All teams have a plan for me. It's about my preparation. I'm going to back my instinct,"" said Abhishek, who was named Player of the Match, at the post-match presentation.""I don't feel my role is high-risk, wouldn't say this is my comfort zone. But I've been practising to go big in the first six. I never do range-hitting. I'm more of a timing batter, I need to watch the ball and get used to the conditions.""For it, I plan in my net session. I feel, if you watch your batting videos, you get an idea of where the bowler bowls to you.""India captain Suryakumar Yadav praised Abhishek’s preparation and composure, saying the opener was reaping the rewards of sustained work behind the scenes.""The way he prepares, I mean, it's not just how he bats in the games, but the way he prepares himself, the way he carries himself, when he's in the hotel, in the team bus. I think all those things, small small things, it reflects on the ground and he is enjoying those fruits of that.""Suryakumar also lauded his batting unit for responding well after early setbacks.""I think it's always good when we get those numbers on the board, and if there's a little bit of dew on the board, I think that's a big positive.""And the way we batted, even after when we were put under pressure in the powerplay, we were 25-2, and then we took the game till the 15th over, and then we never stopped all the batters.""Asked about the balance of eight batters and three strike bowlers, the India skipper said: ""I mean, it looks good. It's been working for me as a team, and so if it's working, let's continue with that.""Suryakumar, who scored a 22-ball 32, also put together a crucial 99-run stand with Abhishek, signalling a return to form.""I mean, I felt good when I went into bat. It was perfect time for me to go into bat. Good pressure situation. I've been batting in that situation. And as I said earlier as well, I've been batting really well in the nets.""It was just a matter of time when you play a few balls, bat the way I bat. And that doesn't change my identity. I think it came naturally. I mean, whatever strokes I played, I've been practicing really well in the last 2-3 weeks.""I'm at it similarly during the net session. Played a few practice games as well. So I was feeling good.""Despite a few lapses in the field, Suryakumar backed his players.""I think with such a heavy dew, a few lines here and there, I mean, I'm just supporting my fielders. But yeah, I mean, we keep improving that one department. We try and improve always when we take on the field. So very happy with the effort from the boys.""Lower-order batter Rinku Singh chipped in with a vital 44 and admitted he felt pressure due to his intermittent presence in the side.""There was pressure on me as I was in and out of the team. The plan was to take singles and then go for it. Also to stay till the end. That's what I did. GG sir told me to keep the intent,"" he said.""We want to take this confidence and momentum forward into the World Cup and win it.""New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner acknowledged India’s dominance at home.""India is a very good team at home. We knew that. Their record the last two years is outstanding. And, yeah, it was a good game for us.""","Abhishek Sharma says he does not believe in range-hitting and relies on instincts and timing.

England’s white-ball captain Harry Brook has admitted that his involvement in an altercation with a nightclub bouncer in New Zealand was a mistake and said he has learnt from the episode.The 26-year-old was fined £30,000 ($40,000) by the England and Wales Cricket Board after the incident in Wellington on the eve of a one-day international. England went on to lose that match, with Brook scoring six.""I've learnt from my mistakes,"" Brook told reporters in Colombo, where England are set to face Sri Lanka in a three-match ODI series starting Thursday.""I've reflected a lot and I know it wasn't the right thing to do,"" he said, speaking publicly for the first time about the incident during the tour that came before the Ashes, which England lost 4-1.""I want to apologise to my team-mates, the fans and the ECB for putting them in a tricky situation,"" said Brook, who is due to lead England at next month’s T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.""It will never happen again. I'm extremely sorry.""England’s Ashes tour was marked by off-field scrutiny, with questions raised about preparation, team selection and a reported ""drinking culture"" within the squad. Players were seen spending long hours in bars during a mid-series break at a beach resort, and a video involving an apparently drunk Ben Duckett circulated on social media.The ODI series in Sri Lanka will be followed by three T20 internationals, which will serve as England’s final preparation ahead of the T20 World Cup that begins on February 7 in India and Sri Lanka.Brook said the upcoming series would be an important test for his team as they look to regain form.""It's important to get used to the conditions, the climate and the heat,"" Brook said. ""We are looking forward to a competitive series.""England’s white-ball results have dipped since the 2023 ODI World Cup in India, where the defending champions failed to reach the semi-finals. Since then, they have lost six of their last seven bilateral series and exited the Champions Trophy after losing all three group matches.""We would like to be a little more consistent, absorb pressure and stay in the game for longer periods,"" Brook said.""Yes, we've lost a few series, but I feel we're heading in the right direction"".Sri Lanka, meanwhile, are dealing with selection concerns ahead of co-hosting the World Cup.

The fourth Test of the 2002 series between India and West Indies, played at Antigua, is widely remembered for Anil Kumble ’s display of courage. In the second innings, Kumble bowled with a broken jaw, his face strapped with bandages, after being hit earlier in the match. That image remains one of cricket's most inspiring sight.""It was one of the bravest things I've seen on the field of play,"" Viv Richards later said.However, the Antigua Test is recalled for reasons beyond Kumble’s injury and resolve. The Test is remembered for more than that moment alone.On May 14, 2002, during West Indies' first innings, wicketkeeper Ajay Ratra bowled the 247th over to Shivnarine Chanderpaul. That created a rare record — it marked the only instance in Test cricket where all eleven players from India bowled in a single innings. India became just the third team to use all 11 players as bowlers in an innings.The match ended in a draw. It was played at the Antigua Recreation Ground in St John’s from May 10 to 14, 2002. The pitch offered little help to bowlers. India scored 513 runs in 196 overs after being reduced to 257 for 6. VVS Laxman , who scored 130, and Ratra added 217 runs for the seventh wicket.West Indies won the toss and chose to field. The series was level at 1-1 heading into the fourth Test.India lost opener Shiv Sunder Das early for 3, but Wasim Jaffer and Rahul Dravid responded with a 155-run partnership for the second wicket. Sachin Tendulkar was dismissed for a first-ball duck, another rare moment. Sourav Ganguly then joined Dravid, and the pair ensured India did not lose any further wickets on the opening day.On the second morning, India lost Ganguly for 45, Dravid for 91 and Kumble for 6 in quick time. Laxman and Ratra then added an unbeaten 205 runs for the eighth wicket. Laxman was dismissed for 130 early on the third day, but Ratra went on to complete his century and added around 40 more runs with the lower order. India declared at 513 for 9 on Day 3.Ratra’s hundred made the 20-year-old the youngest wicketkeeper to score a Test century at the time. West Indies wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs also scored a century, making it the first Test in which the regular wicketkeepers from both teams reached three figures.West Indies replied with 629 for 9 in 248 overs. Captain Carl Hooper scored 136, Chanderpaul made an unbeaten 136, and Jacobs added 118. The match ended in a draw.India used all eleven players as bowlers. Javagal Srinath bowled 45 overs. Ashish Nehra and Zaheer Khan each bowled more than 40 overs. Ganguly bowled 12 overs, while Tendulkar delivered 34. Kumble bowled 14 overs despite his broken jaw and dismissed Brian Lara. Laxman bowled 17 overs and took one wicket. Dravid bowled nine overs and dismissed Jacobs. Jaffer bowled 11 overs and took two wickets. Shiv Sunder Das sent down eight overs, while Ratra bowled one over.The match is best remembered for the guts shown by Anil Kumble as he came on to bowl with a broken jaw to dismiss West Indies great Brian Lara.""For me personally, it was a memorable Test. It was great feeling to score Test hundred on foreign soil. When I went to the middle, there was blood spread at the crease when Anil Kumble was hit by a Merv Dhillon bouncer. I was bit nervous but eventually grew in confidence in company of Laxman. The wicket still had something in it but later on it went on become flatter. I never thought I would bowl in a Test match.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

NEW DELHI: In a decision that could have long-term consequences for cricket in Asia and beyond, the ICC on Wednesday voted to reject the Bangladesh Cricket Board's (BCB) request to shift their T20 World Cup matches from India.""The ICC Men’s T20 World Cup will proceed as scheduled, with Bangladesh’s matches to be played in India,"" the global body said in a release.""The decision was taken after considering all security assessments conducted, including independent reviews, all of which indicated there was no threat to Bangladesh players, media persons, officials and fans at any of the tournament venues in India,"" the ICC release added.In a strongly worded statement, the ICC said that change in venue for Bangladesh's T20 World Cup matches ""would jeopardise the sanctity of future ICC events.""""The ICC Board noted that it was not feasible to make changes so close to the tournament and that altering the schedule under the circumstances, in the absence of any credible security threat, could set a precedent that would jeopardise the sanctity of future ICC events and undermine its neutrality as a global governing body,"" ICC said.While it was not mentioned in the ICC statement, but ESPNcrinifo reported that ICC has asked the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to convey to the Bangladesh government that failure to travel to India for the 2026 T20 World Cup will result in Bangladesh being replaced at the tournament. The position was formalised after a vote at the ICC Board meeting, where a majority backed the option of bringing in a replacement team.The BCB has been given one more day to inform the ICC of its final stance on playing matches in India.If Bangladesh doesn't change its stance, they are unlikely to, then Scotland are expected to replace them in Group C. Scotland did not qualify for the 2026 T20 World Cup through the European Qualifiers, finishing behind the Netherlands, Italy and Jersey, but are next in line based on rankings.The ICC's decision follows weeks of discussions between the ICC and the BCB that failed to resolve a standoff triggered by the removal of Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman from the 2026 Indian Premier League on BCCI instructions citing unspecified ""developments all around"".The standoff began after Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman was removed from the 2026 Indian Premier League following instructions from the BCCI, citing unspecified ""developments all around"". In response, Bangladesh banned the broadcast of the IPL in the country and informed the ICC that it would not send its team to India for the World Cup.The BCB has cited ""security concerns"" and refused to play its group matches scheduled in Kolkata and Mumbai. It has instead pushed for its games to be moved to co-host Sri Lanka or for a group reshuffle that would allow the team to be based entirely outside India.With the tournament schedule already finalised, the ICC has been reluctant to alter venues. Sri Lanka is set to host select matches, including the India–Pakistan fixture, under an existing ICC arrangement in place until 2027.","ICC reject Bangladesh Cricket Board's request to shift their T20 World Cup matches from India.

BENGALURU: Will defending IPL champions Royal Challengers Bengaluru return home or look elsewhere for a base this season? With a little over two months to go before the tournament begins, the question continues to linger. While Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) has received conditional approval to resume matches at M Chinnaswamy Stadium, clarity on RCB’s intent remains elusive.“The ball is in RCB’s court,” KSCA president Venkatesh Prasad said here on Wednesday. Though RCB has actively explored alternative venues, they have not shown the same urgency in engaging with either the state association or the government.According to sources, a major sticking point is the state government’s crowd management bill, which places responsibility on organisers for any untoward incident at a public gathering. RCB, in a statement, said, “While our desire is always to play at our home ground, in front of our fans, we want to be thorough in our commitment to further understand the conditions applicable to host matches here and the measures taken to ensure fans’ safety protocols are met.Our goal is to see how best all stakeholders involved can work together.”With RCB being non-participative with dialogues with the government, Prasad said, “I also hope RCB gets more involved and engages with the government for the smooth conduct of matches. So far, it has been largely one-sided… I sincerely hope and pray Royal Challengers Bengaluru play all their home matches, including the inaugural game, at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. We are confident of completing the required work within the stipulated timelines and obtaining unconditional approval from the government. ”",IPL champions Royal Challengers Bengaluru are yet to make a decision.

NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) board on Wednesday voted against Bangladesh Cricket Board’s (BCB) demand to relocate the Bangladesh team’s T20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka. ICC released a statement saying the board has decided to stick to the already-published schedule in the ‘absence of any independent security findings’, which suggest any threat to the Bangladesh contingent in India.The T20 World Cup starts on Feb 7 with Bangladesh scheduled to play West Indies in Mumbai in one of the three matches on the opening day.It is understood that only the Pakistan board voted in favour of BCB while the rest of the 14 members rejected the demand. TOI has learnt that ICC has given BCB 24 hours after ICC’s meeting on Wednesday to revisit their stance before the world body goes ahead with its process of announcing a replacement team. BCB has got into a huddle with its government adviser. If the BCB doesn’t agree, Scotland are likely to participate in the T20 World Cup as per ICC rankings.BCB, acting on the advice of govt’s adviser to sports ministry Asif Nazrul, took the stance of not sending its team to India after the Indian cricket board (BCCI) decided to oust Bangladesh seamer Mustafizur Rahman from the upcoming IPL.The BCCI didn’t specify any reason for its move and the Bangladesh govt chose to make it an issue of national dignity. The BCB claimed if the BCCI thought Mustafizur’s presence in the IPL was not right then it will be unsafe to send its team to India.As per the schedule, Bangladesh are slated to play one league match in Mumbai and other three league matches in Kolkata. TOI has learnt that the Nazrul and BCB president Aminul Islam are likely to meet the players before communicating their decision to the ICC. ICC chose to address BCB’s issue with BCCI based on Mustafizur’s IPL ouster as an ‘isolated and unrelated development concerning one of its player’s involvement in a domestic league.’“This linkage has no bearing on the tournament’s security framework or the conditions governing participation in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup,” the ICC said, referring to BCB’s concerns.ICC and BCB have been involved in multiple discussions over the last three weeks. “The decision was taken after considering all security assessments conducted, including independent reviews, all of which indicated there was no threat to Bangladesh players, media persons, officials and fans at any of the tournament venues in India,” ICC said.“The ICC management engaged in a series of correspondences and meetings with the BCB in a bid to resolve the impasse, sharing detailed information on the event security plan, including layered federal and state law-enforcement support,” it added.The world body went on to assert that heeding BCB’s request could set a precedent that could undermine ICC’s integrity in the future. “The ICC Board noted that it was not feasible to make changes so close to the tournament and that altering the schedule under the circumstances, in the absence of any credible security threat, could set a precedent that would jeopardise the sanctity of future ICC events and undermine its neutrality as a global governing body.

NEW DELHI: Even as the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup will go ahead as scheduled, with Bangladesh’s matches to be played in India, Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Aminul Islam Bulbul urged that the games be shifted to Sri Lanka, stating that it is not safe for them to play in India at the moment.The decision was taken following an ICC Board meeting, held via video conference on Wednesday, to discuss the way forward after the BCB requested that its matches be moved to Sri Lanka.""Playing in India right now is not safe for us; we want to play in Sri Lanka"", Aminul Islam Bulbul told reporters on Wednesday night.The ICC said the decision came after considering all security assessments, including independent reviews, which indicated that there was no threat to Bangladesh players, media personnel, officials, or fans at any of the tournament venues in India.The ICC Board noted that it was not feasible to make changes so close to the tournament and that altering the schedule under the circumstances, in the absence of any credible security threat, could set a precedent that would jeopardise the sanctity of future ICC events and undermine its neutrality as a global governing body.The ICC management also engaged in a series of correspondences and meetings with the BCB in an effort to resolve the impasse, sharing detailed information on the event’s security plan, including layered federal and state law-enforcement support.An ICC spokesperson said, ""Over the past several weeks, the ICC has engaged with the BCB in sustained and constructive dialogue, with the clear objective of enabling Bangladesh's participation in the tournament. During this period, the ICC has shared detailed inputs, including independent security assessments, comprehensive venue-level security plans and formal assurances from the host authorities, all of which consistently concluded that there is no credible or verifiable threat to the safety or security of the Bangladesh team in India. """"Despite these efforts, the BCB maintained its position, repeatedly linking its participation in the tournament to a single, isolated and unrelated development concerning one of its players' involvement in a domestic league. This linkage has no bearing on the tournament's security framework or the conditions governing participation in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup.""""The ICC's venue and scheduling decisions are guided by objective threat assessments, host guarantees, and the tournament's agreed terms of participation, which apply uniformly to all 20 competing nations. In the absence of any independent security findings that materially compromise the safety of the Bangladesh team, the ICC is unable to relocate fixtures. Doing so would carry significant logistical and scheduling consequences for other teams and fans worldwide, and would also create far-reaching precedent-related challenges that risk undermining the neutrality, fairness, and integrity of ICC governance. The ICC remains committed to acting in good faith, upholding consistent standards, and safeguarding the collective interests of the global game,"" the statement added.The T20 World Cup will begin on February 7. Bangladesh are scheduled to start their T20 World Cup 2026 campaign on February 7 against two-time champions West Indies at Eden Gardens in Kolkata. The Litton Das-led side will then face Italy on February 9 at the same venue before taking on England in Kolkata once again. After the England match, Bangladesh are set to travel to Mumbai to play Nepal at the Wankhede Stadium.However, BCB officials said the board will inform the ICC of Bangladesh’s final decision after consultations with the government on Thursday.","Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Aminul Islam Bulbul urged that the games be shifted to Sri Lanka.

What ICC said



The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Wednesday turned down the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s (BCB) request to move Bangladesh’s T20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka, stating that the fixtures will go ahead as scheduled as there is no credible threat to the safety of Bangladesh players, officials or fans at any venue in India.The decision was taken during an ICC Board meeting held via video conference, which was called after the BCB raised concerns and formally sought a venue change for its matches.""The ICC Board noted that relocating matches under the present circumstances could jeopardise the sanctity of ICC events and undermine the organisation's neutrality as a global governing body,"" the ICC said in a statement.The ICC said the Board examined several security assessments, including independent evaluations, all of which concluded that there was no credible threat to Bangladesh players.14 of the 16 Board members voted against the BCB’s request to relocate the matches, news agency PTI reported, quoting sources. The ICC has given the BCB one more day to review its position and communicate a final decision.""Of all the members, only BCB and Pakistan voted in favour of the relocation request while all other voted against it. Bangladesh was given time till January 21 to confirm its participation but they have been given one more day by the ICC Board to state their position,"" an ICC source was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The ICC also said that changing the schedule at this stage was not possible and that altering fixtures without a verified security risk could set what it called an ""undesirable precedent"" for future global tournaments.""In the absence of any independent security findings that materially compromise the safety of the Bangladesh team, the ICC is unable to relocate fixtures. Doing so would carry significant logistical and scheduling consequences for other teams and fans worldwide, and would also create far-reaching precedent-related challenges that risk undermining the neutrality, fairness, and integrity of ICC governance,"" ICC spokesperson said in a statement.According to the ICC, its management has held multiple meetings and exchanged correspondence with the BCB over recent weeks, sharing detailed information on security arrangements for the tournament.These discussions included venue-specific security plans and assurances of protection involving both federal and state law enforcement agencies.An ICC spokesperson said the governing body had been engaged in ""sustained and constructive dialogue"" with the BCB to ensure Bangladesh’s participation in the event.""Independent security assessments, comprehensive venue-level security plans and formal assurances from host authorities consistently concluded that there is no credible or verifiable threat to the safety or security of the Bangladesh team in India,"" the spokesperson said.The ICC, however, said it was concerned that the BCB continued to link its participation to what it described as a ""single, isolated and unrelated development"" involving one of its players’ involvement in a domestic league, which the ICC said had no connection to the tournament’s security framework.The Board reiterated that decisions related to venues and scheduling are based on threat assessments, host assurances and agreed participation terms, which apply equally to all 20 teams in the tournament.""In the absence of any independent security findings that materially compromise safety, the ICC is unable to relocate fixtures. Doing so would carry significant logistical and scheduling consequences for other teams and fans worldwide, and would also create far-reaching precedent-related challenges that risk undermining the neutrality, fairness, and integrity of ICC governance,"" the spokesperson said.On Tuesday, Bangladesh government’s sports adviser Asif Nazrul reiterated that the national team would not travel to India under any circumstances.If Bangladesh decides to withdraw from the tournament, Scotland is likely to replace them based on current rankings.The dispute began after Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman was removed from Kolkata Knight Riders’ squad for the upcoming Indian Premier League following instructions from the BCCI, citing unspecified ""developments all around"".Citing ""security concerns"", the BCB then announced that the Bangladesh team would not travel to India for its group-stage matches in Kolkata and Mumbai.The BCB has sought to play all four of its group matches in Sri Lanka, where the India–Pakistan match will also be held under an agreed ICC arrangement in place until 2027.Bangladesh are placed in Group C alongside West Indies, Italy, England and Nepal.During its last meeting with ICC officials in Dhaka, the BCB proposed swapping places with Ireland in Group B, which includes co-hosts Sri Lanka, Australia, Oman and Zimbabwe.Such a change would allow Bangladesh to remain based in Sri Lanka for all its group-stage matches.Relations between India and Bangladesh have worsened in recent months, with tensions rising following the killings of Hindus in Bangladesh.Former Bangladesh captain Tamim Iqbal and current Test captain Najmul Hossain Shanto have both urged caution on the issue. Tamim has said that decisions taken now could have consequences a decade later","Bangladesh Cricket Board wants to move T20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka. ICC says there is no credible threat to the safety of Bangladesh players, officials or fans at any venue in India.

'We needed someone…': Rohit Sharma explains why Shreyas Iyer missed T20 World Cup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/we-needed-someone-rohit-sharma-explains-why-shreyas-iyer-missed-t20-world-cup/articleshow/126983578.cms,"India's Shreyas Iyer and Rohit Sharma (AP/PTI)

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: On India T20I Playing XI, personal form and more

Former India captain Rohit Sharma has admitted that watching the T20 World Cup from the sidelines for the first time in his career will feel “strange”, as he reflected on life away from the format and the difficult decisions that shaped his leadership years.Rohit, along with Virat Kohli , now features only in the 50-over format, having retired from Tests and T20 cricket. India will begin the defence of their T20 World Cup title against USA on February 7 in Mumbai, with Rohit no longer part of the playing group.Speaking on a JioHotstar show, the 36-year-old said the reality of missing a global tournament hits far harder than being absent from bilateral series.“We were talking about this at home, that it will be strange watching it from home, especially the T20 World Cup. From the time it started until now, I have been part of every World Cup, so it will feel different,” Rohit said.He added that the finality of not being involved truly sinks in only during World Cups.“When you miss a World Cup, the reality really sinks in. That's when you realise you're not going to be part of it. However, I will be somewhere in the stadium. It won't be the same, but it will be a different experience.”Rohit also used the conversation to reflect on his captaincy tenure and the challenges that came with leading India at the highest level.According to him, taking tough selection calls while maintaining trust within the dressing room was one of the most demanding aspects of the job.“There have been many such instances of taking hard calls before World Cups. You will not be able to please everyone, but it is important for the individual to know why a decision is taken,” he said.He pointed to Shreyas Iyer ’s omission from the Asia Cup and the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia as an example of how team balance often dictated decisions.“We felt we needed someone who could give us a little more with the ball. That’s why we went with Deepak Hooda, who was in good form at the time. Shreyas would have felt bad, Deepak would have been happy — that's how it works,” Rohit said, adding that both he and then head coach Rahul Dravid personally spoke to Iyer to explain the call.Rohit said similar conversations were held with other senior players during his time as captain, including Mohammed Siraj, who missed out on the 2025 Champions Trophy, and Yuzvendra Chahal, who was not selected for the 2023 ODI World Cup.“For us, it is important to understand how we can make the best use of the 15 players in the squad. As long as you have a valid reason and you explain it properly, that is fine,” he said.Beyond selection decisions, Rohit stressed that building strong personal bonds was central to his leadership approach. He said creating an open and approachable environment helped players feel secure, even during difficult phases.“I always wanted an openness to discuss anything, not just cricket but life as well. There are no boundaries; there is always an open door,” Rohit said, adding that humour and mutual respect played a big role in keeping the dressing room relaxed.Looking ahead to the upcoming T20 World Cup, Rohit expressed confidence in the current Indian squad, highlighting stability and continuity as key strengths.“About 80 to 90 per cent of the squad has remained the same since the last T20 World Cup. They have been playing together for almost two years now, which creates strong understanding,” he said, noting that the average age of the group is close to 25.He concluded by underlining what matters most at a World Cup.“When you are heading into a World Cup, the only aim is to win it. For that, you need open conversations and sometimes hard conversations as well.”For Rohit Sharma, the next T20 World Cup will be watched rather than played, but his words offer a rare window into the realities of leadership, sacrifice and transition at the highest level of Indian cricket.",Former India captain Rohit Sharma has admitted that watching the T20 World Cup from the sidelines for the first time in his career will feel ‘strange’ The 36-year-old said the reality of missing a global tournament hits far harder than being absent from bilateral series.

A tough week

Kylian Mbappé criticized Real Madrid fans for singling out Vinícius Júnior and booing the star forward in the team's Spanish league match on Saturday.Mbappé said fans are entitled to boo when they are unhappy, but should criticize the whole squad and not specific players.“I understand the fans,” Mbappé said Monday ahead of the team's Champions League game against Monaco on Tuesday.“Before I was a player, I was a young guy who watched football, was critical and gave his opinion. I completely understand the booing, but if they're going to do it, they should boo the whole squad, not just a few players. We're all playing poorly.”Madrid beat Levante 2-0 on Saturday to end a slide in form that included a loss to Barcelona in the final of the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia last weekend and an embarrassing elimination against second-division club Albacete in the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday.The crowd at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on Saturday jeered loudly when Vinícius' name was announced before the match against Levante, and again nearly every time the Brazil forward touched the ball.“It's not Vini's fault we're not playing as well as we'd like. The whole squad is to blame,” Mbappé said. “That's the only thing I have to say to the fans. Boo the whole squad. We have to turn the situation around. We're all to blame.We're going to do just that because we're Real Madrid players and there are always moments like this.Mbappé said Vinícius was affected by the boos and said the whole squad had to try to support him.“Vini is a human being,” Mbappé said. “It's normal to be affected when people speak negatively about you. Sometimes it's fair, sometimes it's not. Vini is a fantastic player. He's an incredible man. I'm lucky to know him, and I'm very fond of him. We as a team have to protect him better so he's not in this position of being alone against everyone. We're going to protect him so he can give us his best, because when he's at his best, he's one of the best in the world. ”The fans also booed Jude Bellingham and Federico Valverde on Saturday. The trio was considered by many to be among those who were not behind former coach Xabi Alonso, who was fired following the team's loss to Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup. Alonso was replaced by former B-team coach Álvaro Arbeloa.Mbappé said he spoke with Alonso after his departure and wished him well.“I had a wonderful relationship with him. I wish him all the best because I liked how he viewed the game,” Mbappé said.“He's a coach who's obsessed with the game and the details, and he knows a lot about modern soccer. It's a decision by the club that we have to respect. Now there's a new coach, and we have to support him. We're going to give it our all to ensure things go well for both Arbeloa and Real Madrid.”Mbappé was among the players telling Alonso that they would not do the guard of honor to Barcelona in the awards ceremony at the Spanish Super Cup, an image many said showed a break between Alonso and the players in the locker room.“I'm not going to play dumb,” Mbappé said. “Of course, things go on. There are a lot of things said that ultimately aren't true. I don't think that's right. Our job is to accept it, but when I have the opportunity to speak out, I do so. We have to keep quiet and do our talking on the pitch.”Mbappé said it “hasn't been an easy week” for Madrid and the match against Monaco could prove to be a turning point.“We have to show our character to change these kinds of circumstances and to get everyone back on side,” he said.“I think the fans are eager to give us their support, but we have to earn it. We have to keep fighting for all the titles, and tomorrow the most important thing is the Champions League. We're going to show as a team that we can compete and that we're ready to win all the titles we have left this season.”Madrid sits in seventh place in the league phase of the Champions League. The club trails Barcelona by a point in the Spanish league.","Kylian Mbappé says Real Madrid fans are entitled to boo when they are unhappy.

Lionel Messi India tour: Inside story of what went wrong in Kolkata

Drama unfolded in the Africa Cup of Nations final on Sunday as Senegal survived chaos to win the title. With Senegalese players walking off the pitch, fans clashed with security. However, a missed Panenka penalty changed everything.The final was played at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat. Senegal and Morocco were locked at 0-0 deep into injury time. Morocco were then awarded a penalty after a VAR review. The decision was for a challenge on Brahim Diaz.Senegal were already angry. Minutes earlier, they had a goal ruled out for a soft foul. The referee did not check VAR for that moment. When the penalty was given, Senegal players reacted in fury. Some of them walked off the pitch in protest.The situation grew worse in the stands. Senegal fans tried to enter the field. They clashed with security staff. The match was stopped for almost 20 minutes.Eventually, play resumed. Diaz stepped up to take the penalty. He tried a weak Panenka. Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy saved it.Watch:In extra time, Senegal stayed calm. In the fourth minute, Pape Gueye scored a brilliant goal.It was the only goal of the match. Senegal won 1-0 and lifted the trophy.""We had a feeling of injustice. Just before the penalty we thought we should have had a goal and the referee didn't go to VAR,"" said Villarreal midfielder Gueye. ""Sadio told us to come back on and we remobilised. Edouard then made the save, we stayed focused, got the goal and won the game.""Senegal coach Pape Thiaw admitted fault. ""After thinking about it, I realised that I shouldn't have asked them to go off. I apologise for that,"" Thiaw told French broadcaster beIN Sports.""Sometimes you can react in the heat of the moment. Before that we scored a goal that was not given. But now we accept that referees do make mistakes and we apologise.""This was Senegal’s second AFCON title. Their first came four years ago in Cameroon. That final was decided on penalties against Egypt.Gueye’s goal was historic. It was Senegal’s first ever goal in four AFCON finals.""We are very happy with the victory tonight,"" said Gueye. ""We feel pride. We wanted to win tonight. We all saw what happened at the end of the match but we took the decision to come back onto the pitch and give everything, which we did.""",Senegal beat Morocco 1-0 in the Africa Cup of Nations final in Rabat.

We did a very good season until now, but today we lost.""We had our chances, we didn't score and they had less chances, but they scored.""Adding to Villa's woes, their captain John McGinn limped off with a first-half injury.Villa had won their previous 11 home games in all competitions.But Everton's Merlin Rohl nearly shattered that feeling of invincibility in just 11 seconds when he capitalised on sloppy defending to shoot against the post.Despite being a boyhood Villa fan, Everton winger Jack Grealish was loudly jeered on his return to his former club.Grealish almost silenced his tormentors with a goal-bound volley that was blocked by Evann Guessand.Everton's Jake O'Brien headed home from a corner, only to see his effort disallowed for offside against Harrison Armstrong.Villa went close just before half-time when Youri Tielemans's cross picked out Guessand and the Ivory Coast forward looped his header onto the bar.But Emery's men lacked a cutting edge and they paid the price in the 59th minute.- Newcastle frustrated -It was a shambolic goal to concede as Pau Torres carelessly surrendered possession just outside his own area.Dwight McNeil pounced with a shot that Emiliano Martinez pushed out to Barry and the striker chipped the ball into the net from close range for his third goal in his last five appearances.Goalkeeper Jordan Pickford preserved Everton's victory with a brilliant tip-over from Morgan Rogers's curler, leaving Villa with only one win from their last four league games.At rain-lashed Molineux, Eddie Howe's Newcastle were unable to prise open the Wolves defence as two points slipped away.Wins over Burnley, Crystal Palace and Leeds had bolstered their bid to qualify for next season's Champions League.But the Magpies are stuck in eighth place after failing to beat bottom-of-the-table Wolves.Following their disappointing 2-0 defeat against Manchester City in the League Cup semi-final first leg on Tuesday, it was another frustrating result for Newcastle.""We needed to do more in attack. I expected us to do better and create more,"" Howe said after Newcastle took 85 minutes to muster a shot on target.""Football is such a strange game. We scored four against Leeds and looked free-scoring, but today we struggled.""Nick Woltemade has now gone seven games without a goal, scoring just twice in 13 appearances after squandering two good headed chances.With crucial matches against top-four rivals Aston Villa and Liverpool looming before the end of the month, Howe's men must get back on track quickly.Wolves are now unbeaten in four league games but still sit 14 points from safety.",Aston Villa lose 1-0 at home to Everton in the Premier League. Thierno Barry scores only goal of the game in the second half. Newcastle held to 0-0 draw by bottom-of-the-table Wolves at Molineux.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126670587,imgsize-130036,width-400,resizemode-4/aston-villa-v-everton-premier-league.jpg"

Sorloth winner for Atletico

MADRID: Disallowed goals, hitting the woodwork five times, and great saves.It was just too much for Barcelona to overcome on Sunday as it lost 2-1 to Real Sociedad in the Spanish league to see its 11-game winning streak come to an end.Barcelona had three goals disallowed — as well as a penalty-kick call reversed by video review — in the first half alone. It had five attempts hit the woodwork, including an 84th-minute header by Jules Koundé from close range, and Sociedad goalkeeper Álex Remiro made a series of impressive saves.""Disappointed, we created a lot of opportunities. The result does not reflect our game,"" Barcelona coach Hansi Flick said.""Sometimes it's like that. At the end, there are some days you invest a lot of energy and at the end you are unlucky. I appreciate a lot what I saw.""The loss left the Catalan club one point ahead of second-place Real Madrid, which beat Levante 2-0 at home on Saturday.It was the second consecutive win for Sociedad, which moved to eighth place.""Three amazing points,"" said Remiro. He made one terrific close-range save off a header by Robert Lewandowski in the second half.Mikel Oyarzabal put the hosts ahead with a volley by the far post in the 32nd minute. Barcelona equalized with a header from Marcus Rashford in the 70th but a minute later Gonçalo Guedes put Sociedad ahead again with a shot from inside the area.Barcelona had plenty of chances throughout the match. It thought it had taken the lead a few minutes into the game when Fermín López scored with a low shot from outside the area, but the goal was disallowed by video review for a foul by Dani Olmo on Sociedad's Takefusa Kubo in the buildup.Barcelona also had a goal by Frenkie de Jong called back for offside in the 21st and another by Lamine Yamal in the 27th.Yamal was awarded a penalty in first-half stoppage time but the call was reversed because he was offside.""We played well, had many scoring opportunities,"" De Jong said.""We deserved to win. We need to be able to capitalize on these chances.""Sociedad's Carlos Soler was sent off in the 88th for a hard foul.Barcelona had won 11 in a row across all competitions in a streak that included a 2-1 victory over Real Madrid in the final of the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia last weekend. It hadn't lost since a 3-0 road defeat against Chelsea in the league phase of the Champions League.Its last Spanish league loss had been a 2-1 defeat against Real Madrid in the first clasico of the season at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in October.Barcelona forward Raphinha was not included in the squad for Sunday's match. João Cancelo made his debut off the bench in the second half after recently signing with the Catalan club.Kubo had to be taken off the field on a stretcher in the second half because of an injury.Alexander Sorloth scored early in the second half to give Atletico Madrid a 1-0 home win over relegation-threatened Alaves.Sorloth struck in the 48th minute with a firm header from near the penalty spot after Pablo Barrios crossed from the right flank. The ball hit the post at the far corner before going in.It was the 10th start in 19 league games for Sorloth this season. The Norway forward has six goals, three with headers.Alaves, winless in five straight league games, came close to equalizing a few times late in the match at the Metropolitano stadium in the Spanish capital.Alaves has seven losses in its last nine league games, with its only win, 1-0, against Real Sociedad in December.Earlier Sunday, Valencia moved out of the relegation zone by winning 1-0 at Getafe with an 84th-minute goal by José Gayà.The result ended Valencia's six-game winless streak in the league. Getafe is now winless in six consecutive league games, with five losses.Celta Vigo routed 10-man Rayo Vallecano 3-0 at home. The visitors played with 10 men from the 66th after Nobel Mendy was sent off for a hard foul after VAR review.It was the third win in a row for Celta, which is seventh. Rayo is 13th.",Barcelona's 11-game winning streak comes to an end in 2-1 loss to Real Sociedad. Atletico Madrid wins 1-0 at home over relegation-threatened Alaves.

From Hoshiarpur to Lima: Manisha graduates to football's 'next level',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/from-hoshiarpur-to-lima-manisha-graduates-to-footballs-next-level/articleshow/126641139.cms,"Suryakumar Yadav, the captain, has best horoscope | Greenstone Lobo predicts

KOCHI: Manisha Kalyan’s journey has never followed the well-trodden path. Her move from India to Peru is another sharp turn taken with purpose. From Gokulam Kerala’s relentless pressing game to the demanding rhythms of South American football , the left winger has stepped into what she calls the “next level” of learning.Peru’s Alianza Lima Femenino signed Manisha from Greek club PAOK FC, the South American club announced on Friday.Alianza Lima Femenino will be the third overseas club in Manisha’s career. After playing for Sethu FC and Gokulam Kerala at home, the 24-year-old joined Cyprian club Apollon Ladies FC in 2022. She became the first Indian footballer to compete in the UEFA Women’s Champions League. She scored 14 goals in 36 matches for Apollon Ladies.In 2024, Manisha joined Greek club PAOK FC.Manisha, however, gained in prominence at home, when she featured for Gokulam Kerala FC from 2018 to 2022, a club in which she notched up 21 goals in 24 appearances.Now, having already tested herself in Greece, Manisha is clear about her progression. The level in Europe, she admits, was good.""Peru, though, feels different...it's more professional, more exacting, and far less forgiving.Training sessions are longer, sharper, and layered with detail. Fitness is non-negotiable. Technique is constantly refined. Tactical drills, focus on ball positioning, timing and awareness being in the right place at the right time,"" she tells TOI.For Manisha, this is not a leap of faith so much as the next step in a carefully built learning process. She speaks like a player still in her apprenticeship, not someone content with milestones already reached.The move, on a one-year contract, is about absorbing football education in its most purest form. ""There is still a lot to learn and improve and there's no better place to do that than here in Peru. In terms of technique and fitness, I think this is where I want to be at this stage of my career,"" she explains.""How to read space, how to stretch a back line from the left wing, and how to make decisions under pressure are things I'm looking to learn,"" she adds.There is quiet pride, too, in how far she has come. From Hoshiarpur in Punjab to Greece and now Peru, Manisha carries the imprint of Indian footballers who are hungry to improve. Gokulam Kerala shaped her edge and ambition. In Peru, in a more demanding environment, she believes she has found the classroom she was looking for.","Peru's Alianza Lima Femenino sign Manisha Kalyan from Greek club PAOK FC.

- A step forward -

MADRID: Angry Real Madrid fans jeered their own team before they went on to beat Levante 2-0 in La Liga on Saturday to record new coach Alvaro Arbeloa's first win at the helm. Villarreal, third, stumbled to a 2-0 defeat at Real Betis, hampering their attempts at mounting a title challenge.Arbeloa's debut after replacing Xabi Alonso ended in a humiliating Copa del Rey defeat in midweek at second-tier Albacete, but second-half goals from Kylian Mbappe and Raul Asencio secured Madrid three vital points at a moody Santiago Bernabeu.Second-place Madrid cut the gap on leaders Barcelona to one point before the in-form Spanish champions visit Real Sociedad on Sunday.Star players Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham came in for ire from the home fans after a disastrous week. Mbappe also started but was spared the jeers.The French forward had been expected to return for the Champions League game against Monaco next week as he manages his recovery from a knee sprain.""I've always respected the Bernabeu (crowd), they whistled me a lot too (as a player), and it's one of the aspects that make this club so great, how demanding the fans are,"" said Arbeloa, defending the right of the fans to express themselves.It was Arbeloa's 43rd birthday and he was eventually able to celebrate with a victory, although his team lacked energy and spark in the first half.That was not the case in the stands as a significant part of the crowd harangued their own team, in response to a wild week at the club.Los Blancos lost the Spanish Super Cup final to rivals Barcelona in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, parted ways with Alonso on Monday and then crashed out of the cup on Wednesday.Some fans also chanted for president Florentino Perez to resign in a sour atmosphere in the Spanish capital.Mbappe had the best chance of a flat first half against the team in 19th in La Liga. Reaching a long ball the French superstar met it with a volley that flew wide of the post.Home fans jeered their side in at the break and Madrid emerged for the second half with more impetus, with Arbeloa bringing on Franco Mastantuono and Arda Guler.Mbappe drew a foul in the area from Adrian de la Fuente to earn a penalty, which he dispatched for his 19th league goal of the campaign.Mbappe has scored 50 goals in 53 La Liga games, taking only a little longer than Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer Cristiano Ronaldo to reach the milestone.The Portuguese managed it in 51 appearances.Asencio doubled Madrid's advantage with a header into the top corner from Guler's corner as the hosts took control.Bellingham came close to adding a third but Mathew Ryan parried his header and then saved Vinicius's effort after a darting run from the Brazilian.Ryan thwarted Bellingham again as tensions calmed by the end, with the crowd temporarily sated by the victory. Unless Madrid can build on it, the jeers and whistles will return.""Today was a very important day, playing in front of our fans, we wanted to turn around the situation,"" Asencio told Real Madrid TV.""What happened at Albacete should not have happened, we felt guilty and we wanted to make things better.""Elsewhere, Vedat Muriqi scored a hat-trick for Mallorca in a 3-2 win over Athletic Bilbao, before Villarreal fell to defeat at La Cartuja.Aitor Ruibal and Pablo Fornals's second-half goals helped Betis earn an impressive victory over Marcelino Garcia Toral's visitors.The loss leaves Villarreal eight points behind leaders Barcelona and damaged their chances of competing for a first-ever La Liga title.Betis had more of the ball in an otherwise even first half before Ruibal volleyed them ahead after 57 minutes.Santi Comesana's red card for a rash challenge on Giovani Lo Celso made Villarreal's job harder and Fornals killed the game by drilling home with precision from outside the area with seven minutes remaining.""It was a hard-fought game, the details led to Betis winning, I think a draw would have been fairest,"" Villarreal midfielder Dani Parejo told Movistar.""We lacked the finishing touch but had some clear chances... I think the team showed up well, but in both boxes we weren't quite good enough.""","Real Madrid beat Levante 2-0 in La Liga on Saturday to record new coach Alvaro Arbeloa's first win at the helm.

Drake Maye responds to Mike Vrabel’s viral Super Bowl remark

Drake Maye is winning games, earning respect, and quickly becoming the face of the New England Patriots’ rebuild. In just his second NFL season, the former first-round pick has turned early pressure into real momentum, leading the Patriots deep into the playoffs and back into the national conversation.But this week, Maye found himself reacting to something very different from game plans and coverages. A viral old comment from his head coach, Mike Vrabel, made the rounds again, and Maye was asked what he thought about one of the most outrageous Super Bowl quotes in recent NFL history.During Maye’s appearance on the WEEI Afternoon Show in Boston. The hosts asked the star QB about a famous line Vrabel delivered back in 2019 when he was the HC of the Tennessee Titans.“I would be down,” Maye said on WEEI. “But the body part coach Vrabel referred to, I would be no comment. That would be a tough decision.”The quote Maye was reacting to came from Vrabel’s appearance on the Bussin’ With the Boys podcast on Feb. 13, 2019. Former Titans lineman Taylor Lewan asked Vrabel if he would cut off his private part to win a Super Bowl. Vrabel did not hesitate.“Been married 20 years,” Vrabel said on the podcast.“Yeah, probably.”He even doubled down moments later, joking that his wife was involved in the decision. The clip went viral at the time and still resurfaces every postseason. Maye’s reaction showed a clear contrast in personalities. Vrabel leaned into dark humor. Maye kept it honest and careful—just a young quarterback choosing his words in front of a live radio audience.The timing made the moment even bigger. The Pats had just beaten the Houston Texans 28-16 on January 19, 2026, in the AFC Divisional Round at Gillette Stadium. Maye threw 3 TD passes and controlled the game from start to finish.After that win, Maye also spoke about Vrabel’s influence during his postgame press conference.“He challenges me every day,” Maye said at Gillette Stadium. “In practice, after drives, even after good plays. He stays on me.”That relationship explains why the old joke landed differently now. Vrabel is no longer just a viral quote. He is Maye’s coach—the guy setting the culture in New England. Maye did not dodge the question, nor did he chase headlines. He answered like a quarterback who knows the spotlight is real now. Vrabel’s quote will always live online. But Maye’s focus stays simple. Win games. Stay grounded. And keep the jokes off the sacrifice list.",Drake Maye was asked about Mike Vrabel's viral Super Bowl quote. The New England Patriots quarterback said he would be down to cut off his private part to win a Super Bowl. The quote came from a Tennessee Titans podcast in February 2019.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127091899,imgsize-50660,width-400,resizemode-4/nfl-drake-maye-mike.jpg"
Josh Allen Injury Update: Buffalo Bills provide worrying news about star QB and its impact on 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/josh-allen-injury-update-buffalo-bills-provide-worrying-news-about-star-qb-and-its-impact-on-2026/articleshow/127087669.cms,"Josh Allen injury update: Buffalo Bills provide worrying news about Josh Allen and its impact on 2026 (Getty)

Brandon Beane confirms Josh Allen may need a foot procedure before OTAs

The Buffalo Bills entered the offseason looking for answers following another painful playoff exit. Instead, they left their first major press conference of 2026 with a new concern that could impact the future. This time, it had little to do with coaching or roster moves. Josh Allen ’s health is now at the center of Buffalo’s plans. And for the first time in years, there is real confusion around how his body will hold up going into a critical season for the franchise.After a messy season, this news landed hard. During a recent press conference meant to address Sean McDermott’s firing, the Bills' officials revealed that their QB may need foot surgery.On Tuesday, Bills owner Terry Pegula and general manager Brandon Beane spoke to reporters in Orchard Park for the first time since McDermott’s termination. Late in the session, Beane confirmed that Allen is dealing with a lingering foot injury.“He could have something done to his foot potentially here soon,” Beane said during the press session. “But it would not impact like OTA stuff if he does.”The injury first appeared in Week 16 against the Cleveland Browns on Dec.21, 2025. The star QB was visibly uncomfortable in that matchup but stayed on the gridiron. The issue carried into the postseason and worsened during the AFC Wild Card loss to the Denver Broncos on Jan. 19 at Empower Field. Allen entered that game with three separate injury designations, including foot, knee, and finger issues. He still played every snap.Despite the concern, Beane said the crew expects Allen to be ready for Organized Team Activities in late May 2026. No surgery has been scheduled yet, but further medical testing is ongoing.The bigger issue is the pattern. Allen has now played through major injuries in four straight seasons. In 2022, he suffered a partial UCL tear in his elbow but never missed a start. In 2025, he dealt with a throwing hand injury early in the year and later a right elbow contusion. Now comes the foot.Allen has not missed a single game since 2018, when he sat out four weeks with an elbow injury. He currently holds the longest active starting streak among NFL quarterbacks. That toughness is part of what makes him special. It is also what worries the Bills.Allen finished the 2025 season with 3,668 passing yards, 579 rushing yards, and 39 total TDs. He followed his 2024 MVP campaign with another elite year, even while playing in constant pain. He will turn 30 before the 2026 season begins. With a new head coach coming in and the Buffs still chasing their first Super Bowl, the margin for error is gone.The Bills are not panicking yet. But this is the first time Allen’s health has entered real offseason discussion. If surgery helps protect his long-term future, Buffalo will likely take that route. For a league built entirely around one player, keeping Josh Allen upright might be the most important move they make all year.","Josh Allen has not missed a single game since 2018, when he sat out four weeks with an elbow injury.

J.J. McCarthy reflects on growth, family, and criticism



J.J. McCarthy and Katya Kuropas with Rome (Instagram)

J.J. McCarthy is officially in offseason mode, but life around him feels anything but quiet. With football paused and the Minnesota Vikings turning the page on a 9–8 campaign, the 23-year-old quarterback is leaning into a far more personal chapter at home with fiancée Katya Kuropas and their infant son, Rome. Even as questions swirl about his growth on the field, McCarthy’s world away from the stadium has offered clarity, warmth, and perspective.The season closed without a playoff spot, despite a late surge that gave fans hope. For McCarthy, it was another year shaped by resilience. After missing his entire rookie season due to a knee injury, the former Michigan standout returned to log 1,632 passing yards, 11 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. The numbers told only part of the story. The rest played out in lessons learned, mistakes absorbed, and steady flashes of promise under pressure.Away from game tape and stat sheets, McCarthy’s biggest win came in September with the birth of Rome. The quarterback has openly shared tender moments, from receiving a heartfelt team gift to introducing his newborn to the family’s giant dogs. Those snapshots revealed a softer side that contrasted sharply with the criticism he faced during uneven stretches of the season.Kuropas remained a constant presence throughout. Her game-day fits often caught attention, whether it was a striking all-black look or a rare stadium appearance that turned heads. On Tuesday, as McCarthy marked his 23rd birthday, she posted a message that cut through the noise. “Happy birthday to the love of my life!!! You are so special to me and everything I could’ve ever asked for in a life partner 🤎🤎” The post was followed by a bold knee-high boots look that lit up social feeds.McCarthy’s own birthday message carried more weight. In an Instagram carousel shared on January 20, images of family milestones sat alongside defining moments from the season. One line stood out as a response to his critics. “Keep every stone they throw at you,” the message reads. “You got castles to build.”It was not defiance. It was resolve. For a quarterback still early in his journey, maturity is no longer a buzzword. It is the assignment. With family grounding him and lessons fresh in mind, McCarthy enters the offseason knowing growth, like castles, is built one stone at a time.","Minnesota Vikings quarterback J.J.

Her viral complaint highlighted broader fan frustration with complex digital access and soaring playoff prices, reigniting debate over whether the league prioritizes convenience or corporate control over the fan experience.

Kelly Stafford’s ticket struggle highlights growing NFL playoff access problem

The NFL playoffs are supposed to feel electric, dramatic, and fan-first. Instead, a quiet frustration bubbling among traveling supporters spilled into public view when Kelly Stafford shared a moment that struck a nerve across the league. What should have been a simple ticket purchase turned into a small digital obstacle course ahead of one of the season’s biggest games.With the Los Angeles Rams preparing to face the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship, Stafford revealed how league-mandated mobile ticketing made her jump through hoops just to attend. The moment resonated because it mirrored what countless fans face every postseason, only this time, it came from someone deep inside the NFL world.Kelly Stafford summed up the irritation in one blunt line that quickly spread online. “Honestly though … this whole you have to download the other team’s app to get your ticket to the game is getting a little absurd,” she wrote.Stafford’s story showed her deleting one team app and installing another simply to access tickets. While this process is tied to the NFL’s Ticketmaster-backed system, many fans feel it prioritizes platforms over people.For road fans especially, the experience often feels clunky, confusing, and unnecessary..This is not Kelly Stafford’s first public clash with NFL ticket culture. During Super Bowl week, she openly criticized the league’s pricing structure, calling out the growing corporate grip on premium seating.“The Super Bowl has become a big corporation event. Big corporations are coming in buying those suites. Suites in general are expensive. Honestly, though, $2.5 million is absolutely absurd. That’s crazy,” she said on her podcast.Meanwhile, frustration cuts both ways. In Seattle, fans reportedly waited hours in freezing conditions for a lottery chance to buy discounted tickets. Prices on resale platforms have soared well past what many locals can afford.The stadiums remain full. The passion has not faded. But moments like this raise a question the NFL can no longer ignore. In a league built on fan loyalty, should accessing a seat really feel this hard?","Kelly Stafford’s ticket struggle highlights growing NFL playoff access problem.

Tom Brady’s championship game appearance with Alix Earle reignites dating rumors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-bradys-championship-game-appearance-with-alix-earle-reignites-dating-rumors/articleshow/127063415.cms,"Tom Brady and Alix Earle attending the same College Football Playoff title game reignited online speculation. Photos placed both at the stadium alongside Bill Belichick, fuelling chatter despite no evidence of a connection. Brady’s continued Las Vegas Raiders involvement kept him firmly in the spotlight.

Championship night turns viral as Tom Brady and Alix Earle cross paths

When cameras caught Tom Brady and Alix Earle inside the same stadium on college football’s biggest night, the internet did what it does best. It connected dots, replayed old rumours, and turned a shared public appearance into a full-blown conversation. The timing alone was enough to light the fuse. A national championship setting. Two massive names. And a fan base that never misses a subplot.What followed was not a scandal, but a surge of curiosity. Brady, now a minority owner with the Las Vegas Raiders, was there as football royalty. Earle arrived with her own spotlight, powered by millions of followers and a personal life that rarely stays private for long. The overlap was brief, but it was loud. “Tom Brady was embraced by the Championship referees, celebrated as a legend”Speculation grew because of who else was in the building. Bill Belichick, Brady’s longtime partner from the New England Patriots dynasty years, was also present.

He posed for photos, talked football, and wore Raiders gear, reinforcing his growing role off the field. Retirement has not pulled him away from the game. It has simply changed how he shows up.In today’s sports culture, presence alone can spark a narrative.

Hailee Steinfeld cancels live event as Bills turmoil deepens

The Buffalo Bills’ playoff collapse did not end when the final whistle blew in Denver. Days later, the fallout spilled into personal lives, public moments, and unexpected headlines. As Buffalo processed a stunning postseason exit and a coaching shake-up, attention quietly shifted to someone standing just outside the locker room spotlight.For Hailee Steinfeld , the week brought a mix of anticipation and disappointment. While supporting her husband through one of the most emotional stretches of his career, Steinfeld also had to deliver news her own followers were not expecting. The timing made it sting more.After the Bills’ overtime loss to the Broncos and the firing of head coach Sean McDermott, Josh Allen went quiet publicly. Steinfeld, however, had been opening up in her personal newsletter, sharing behind-the-scenes thoughts on awards season and football colliding in real time.She teased an upcoming Substack Live appearance with longtime friend Derek Blasberg, writing, “We’ll have more award show behind-the-scenes coming next week.

CBS Sports’ Tracy Wolfson posted, “Asked Josh about this pic and he told me he had no idea it was floating around. Laughed and said she was probably paid to be there.

Kayla Nicole on Finding Peace Amid Fame... and Her No-Regrets Reality TV Stint

Kayla Nicole knows how quickly a casual comment can turn into a viral firestorm. This time, it was not a red carpet look or a cryptic post. It was one short answer on a podcast that sent social media into overdrive and dragged her back into the centre of online debate.The backlash unfolded fast and loudly. Fans clipped the moment, shared it across platforms, and reacted with little mercy. What may have sounded like an offhand dream instead became another flashpoint in the ongoing scrutiny surrounding her name, her past, and her ties to one of the most watched celebrity circles in sports and pop culture.During a guest appearance on Boyfriend Material, hosted by Harry Jowsey, Kayla Nicole was asked which television project she would want to join. Her response came instantly. “Dancing With the Stars,” Nicole said. “You see how quick I answered that? I’ve been thinking about it.”She later admitted she had only watched a few episodes from the most recent season of Dancing With the Stars. That detail did not help her case once the clip reached TikTok. Commenters were blunt. “ABC would never,” one user wrote. Another added, “That’s so pathetic.” Several joked she would not last beyond the first elimination.The reaction landed during a tense moment for Nicole. Weeks earlier, fans accused her of shading her ex, Travis Kelce , and his fiancée Taylor Swift through a Halloween costume inspired by Toni Braxton’s “He Wasn’t Man Enough for Me.” One comment read, “No sneakin dissing cause it’s loud & clear.”Old controversies soon resurfaced as well, including past tweets containing racist language aimed at Vanessa Bryant. Nicole addressed that directly in a public apology on Instagram Stories, writing, “I want to take a moment to sincerely apologize for the hurtful tweets I posted so many years ago,” and adding, “Seeing them resurface last week has been incredibly difficult, and reading them now, I’m ashamed that I ever thought or spoke that way. ”Whether fair or harsh, the response to her DWTS comment shows how little margin exists for missteps online. For Kayla Nicole, even a simple answer now carries weight far beyond the microphone.","Kayla Nicole faced fresh online backlash after saying she wants to join Dancing With the Stars.

Brittany Mahomes’ milestone celebration sparks backlash over chaotic fashion choices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/brittany-mahomes-milestone-celebration-sparks-backlash-over-chaotic-fashion-choices/articleshow/126975528.cms,"Brittany Mahomes’ 30th birthday weekend in Nashville sparked online backlash after her outfits and party themes went viral for the wrong reasons. From flashy cowboy boots to mismatched themed nights, fans called the looks chaotic and overdone. Even guest appearances, including Taylor Swift, failed to distract from what many dubbed a full fashion disaster.

Brittany Mahomes' birthday theme turned into fashion chaos

Thirty is supposed to feel polished, confident and a little elevated. Brittany Mahomes’ 30th birthday weekend in Nashville went in the opposite direction, and the internet noticed immediately. What started as a girls’ trip packed with cocktails, country music, and Instagram stories slowly unraveled into a style spiral that left fans stunned for all the wrong reasons.As photos rolled in, reactions followed fast. Outfit after outfit felt louder, busier, and more confusing than the last. Instead of a standout birthday moment, the weekend became a rolling fashion commentary where even the guests seemed unsure what theme they were dressing for. Nashville flair is expected. This felt like excess without editing.Brittany Mahomes opened the trip in full tourist mode with metallic cowboy boots and denim on denim. It was predictable but harmless. The problem was that nothing was reset after that. Cowboy hats multiplied. Western boots appeared in every colour imaginable. The group aesthetic quickly blurred into one long costume party that never quite landed.Later looks only added to the confusion. A brown wrap dress paired with dramatic sleeves and heavy accessories drew comparisons no one wants on a birthday night. Friends leaned into the same muddy tones, turning group photos into a sea of beige and brown that felt dated rather than daring. “Alexa, play ""Return to Sender"" by Elvis Presley.” summed it up perfectly.The boat day sealed the internet’s verdict. Zebra print swimwear. Rhinestone cowboy hats. Neon fuzzy headwear. It felt less like a celebration and more like everyone lost a bet.Even a little black dress night failed to bring clarity. Pinstripes, mismatched silhouettes, and clashing vibes dominated the final evening. The irony was hard to miss. Taylor Swift stood out simply by keeping things clean. Her black corset dress worked, and fans clocked her clever reuse of the thigh chain she once wore at the Grammys. Still, expectations ran high for her, and even this look felt quieter than usual.Not every birthday needs to be perfect. This one just became memorable for reasons no one planned.","Brittany Mahomes' 30th birthday weekend in Nashville went viral for the wrong reasons.

Matthew Stafford’s mother recalls a disturbing visual story from shoulder surgery

Matthew Stafford was born in Tampa, Florida. His family moved to Dallas, Texas, when he was in high school. His father, John Stafford, swam at Florida State University. He was a graduate assistant coach at the University of Georgia, then head coach at Bolles from 1972 to 1976, and at Florida State from 1977 to 1983. He later left coaching to start a private insurance business in Tampa.Excerpts from the November 2024 episode “The Morning After with Matthew’s Mom Margaret” onpodcast share details about Matthew Stafford’s mother, Margaret. She is curious, well-versed in the arts, and very creative. She was involved with a designer magazine in Dallas for a long time.Margaret’s parenting style: “You do parent different kids differently from what their needs are or what they excel at.I wanted to make sure he [Matthew] was always loving it [football] and having fun because there’s nothing more miserable than being on a field and seeing a child who doesn’t want to be there. You see that more when they’re younger.”Margaret has been a constant presence at Matthew’s games, often boosting his confidence as an athlete. He has a younger sister, Page, who is often spotted in Kelly Stafford’s old Instagram photos.In the podcast, Margaret describes her experience with Stafford’s successful shoulder surgery in 2011. Dr. James Andrews inserted a metal rod into the shoulder.Margaret and her family watched the surgery through a glass wall. She recalled that a trainer was sent from Detroit [Lions] and allowed into the surgery. He stood on a box over Matthew’s head with his hands folded, just watching.She recalls Dr. Andrews showing the wire [metal rod] and saying, “This is what we’re putting in.” She almost fainted.She started crying on the podcast when she recalled the whole setup of observing the surgery, with that trainer just watching him; she felt like, “Oh, that’s his piece of property. That is his money man. He’s on the table, and he [trainer] was sent from Detroit to make sure that everything was okay.He’s lovely, and I was glad he was there, but the whole setup was like, ‘Oh, this is not my baby.’ It’s not like when you take your child to a pediatrician...”Hank Winchester [veteran Detroit TV reporter and fellow host of podcast] completed her sentence, “You felt like you were watching a piece of machinery, almost, like they were working on a machine being fixed.” Margaret agreed.","Margaret Stafford is the mother of Los Angeles Rams star quarterback Matthew Stafford.

Fans called the comment tone deaf, pointing to his wealth and engagement to Taylor Swift. What began as humor quickly turned into a heated debate about privilege, timing, and self-awareness.

Fans erupt after Travis Kelce’s Powerball joke sparks backlash

When Travis Kelce cracked a lighthearted Powerball joke after a Christmas Day loss, he likely expected laughter. Instead, the comment landed in the middle of a simmering online mood, where wealth, timing, and public perception collide fast. Social media did not treat the moment as harmless humour. Fans heard something else entirely, and they did not hold back.The reaction was instant and sharp. With retirement rumours swirling and Kelce’s engagement already placing him in billionaire territory, the joke struck many as detached from reality. What followed was a wave of commentary that turned a casual press conference moment into a full-blown debate about privilege, awareness, and celebrity tone in hard times.Travis Kelce joked, ""No. The only time it ever crossed my mind was when I was driving in the other day and I saw how much the Powerball was, and I was like, 'Man. If I could just win that. I wouldn't have to work another day in my life'.""One user replied bluntly, “Did he forget who he’s marrying.” Another wrote, “Thought he was getting married to a billionaire?” Others were less subtle. “Considering the type of women he used to date He’s def got his ticket,” one comment read.The frustration only grew as the joke circulated. A verified account posted, “why are rich people so fucking tone deaf... you ALREADY don’t ever have to work another day in your life. and you’re marrying a filthy rich billionaire. read the f*****g room.”Some fans mocked the idea of hardship altogether. “Hahaha! This dork plays 17 hours a year and calls that work.” Another reaction focused on the wider picture. “Real funny him talking about ‘ if he could just win powerball ‘ as a joke , when there’s people in the World that need money desperately. Yet he has is 400 million and his Billion dollar Gfriend . Real Funny !”The sharpest critique cut straight to perception. “What an ass. You mock everyone who witnesses your lifestyle and we know you already ‘won’ the powerball. How much more do you need. Guy has no self awareness.”.For some fans, the issue was not the joke itself but the timing. With economic pressure weighing heavily on everyday households, Kelce’s comment felt out of step. In a league where stars are scrutinised beyond the field, even a passing laugh can shift the narrative.Whether fair or not, the moment shows how quickly humour turns into headline fuel when fame, fortune, and public sentiment intersect.","Travis Kelce sparked online backlash after joking that winning the Powerball would mean he would never have to work again.

Is Steve Kerr leaving the Golden State Warriors?



Steve Kerr is under pressure for Warriors roster direction after Jimmy Butler’s injury



The glory of the Golden State Warriors this season is not close to the standard as any fan would expect due to several issues at hand. Right after Jimmy Butler suffered a season-ending torn ACL, the problem for the franchise only increased. The roster alone is not in the question but the man who has defined Golden State’s modern era from the sidelines finds himself in uncertainty.With Steve Kerr in the final year of his contract, signs of transition are emerging inside the organization. League sources suggest the conversation around Kerr’s future has moved beyond abstract speculation. Behind the scenes, preparations are quietly underway, hinting that a long and successful partnership may be approaching a natural pause.According to The Ringer’s Logan Murdock, multiple assistant coaches are already planning for life beyond this season. The report states:“This is the final year of his contract, and as of Wednesday, he has yet to sign a new deal. Though Kerr has publicly been mum about his future, multiple assistant coaches have been operating under the premise that he will not return next season, according to team sources, with some surveying the league to secure jobs next season.”The assistant movement has already reshaped Kerr’s bench in recent years. Kenny Atkinson left to take over in Cleveland two seasons ago. Chris DeMarco exited midseason to become head coach of the WNBA’s New York Liberty. That history adds context to why staffers are now scanning the market early.Publicly, the message from the top remains consistent. Mike Dunleavy Jr. has reiterated that Kerr can stay as long as he wants. Kerr himself has described his status as “year-to-year.” Still, the grind of this season, paired with Butler’s injury, may be forcing a reassessment.The Warriors’ roster as a whole is not looking good for obvious reasons. Butler is out for the year. Jonathan Kuminga has requested a trade. Stephen Curry and Draymond Green are nearing the later chapters of their careers.Butler’s season-ending injury was a major blow for the Warriors to recover this season. Draymond Green captured the uncertainty facing the group, saying, “We’ve got to get through it,” before adding, “What does that mean for us long term? I don’t know. If I had all the answers right now, I would gladly give them to you. But I just don’t.” Now, it would be interesting to see how Kerr handles the roster to secure wins in the coming days.Of course, Kerr’s prowess needs no introduction. In more than 11 seasons, he has delivered four championships and a 592-328 record. As of now, it is still unclear if Kerr retains his position in the Bay Area.",Steve Kerr is in the final year of his contract with the Golden State Warriors.

Milwaukee Bucks vs Oklahoma City Thunder Game Outlook

The Oklahoma City Thunder face the Milwaukee Bucks on January 21, 2026. According to recent reports, both teams are dealing with serious injury issues that have prevented rotations from being flexible. These injuries have removed several regulars, forcing each side to make unfavorable adjustments and work with what’s available.Instead of leaning on full-strength lineups, this game comes down to how well each team manages minutes and matchups. Role players will be asked to do more than usual, and small mistakes could swing the result. The team that stays steady, runs its sets, and avoids turnovers is likely to come out on top.Oklahoma City Thunder arrive with a long list of absences, including starters and important rotation players. The Thunder have already been forced to play shorthanded in recent games and will face similar constraints again.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Chet Holmgren remain available and will carry much of the load. In the previous game against Cleveland, the Thunder finished with just 10 players, and both Caruso and Jaylin Williams were forced out early.That experience may help Oklahoma City adjust again, but the lack of depth limits flexibility.Milwaukee Bucks is also dealing with multiple injuries, particularly among frontcourt and wing players. These absences affect rebounding, spacing, and defensive matchups.With Turner out due to an ankle sprain and Prince unavailable after neck surgery, the Bucks lose size and defensive coverage. Giannis Antetokounmpo remains the centerpiece, while Bobby Portis is expected to handle extra work on the glass. Porter’s absence also creates more minutes for guards further down the rotation.Both teams are thin, and neither can afford foul trouble or inefficient stretches. Oklahoma City is missing multiple rotation players, while Milwaukee lacks depth in the frontcourt and on the wing. The pace may increase, and perimeter shooting could play a larger role. Players who normally come off the bench will likely decide how this game turns out.","The Oklahoma City Thunder face the Milwaukee Bucks on January 21, 2026.

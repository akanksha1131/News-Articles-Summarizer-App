Dinesh Karthik makes SA20 debut, praises Joe Root’s impact at Paarl Royals

Joburg Super Kings (JSK) secured a six-run victory over MI Cape Town via the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method in a rain-marred SA20 clash at the Wanderers on Saturday.Persistent thunder showers on the Highveld caused multiple interruptions, ultimately leading to a curtailed contest where JSK emerged victorious.The match was initially set for a target of 141 runs, but a lengthy delay after the innings break revised the chase to 136 runs from 19 overs. JSK were well-positioned at 82/3 after 11.3 overs when rain returned, putting them six runs ahead on the DLS calculation. With the downpour persisting, the game was called off, handing JSK the victory and four valuable match points.At the crease for JSK when play stopped were Leus du Plooy (24 not out) and Wihan Lubbe (0 not out). Captain Faf du Plessis provided a steady foundation earlier in the innings with a 30-run knock, off 23 balls, before a stunning dismissal, caught by Dewald Brevis at the cover boundary. Brevis showcased exceptional athleticism, tipping the ball back into play and completing a diving catch in the same motion.For MI Cape Town, Kagiso Rabada impressed in his first appearance of Season 3, claiming 2/10 in a fiery spell. However, his efforts were in vain as the rain thwarted Cape Town's chances of a comeback.Earlier in the day, MI Cape Town’s innings struggled for momentum, with JSK reducing them to 30/4. George Linde played a crucial role in the recovery, anchoring the innings with an unbeaten 48 off 35 balls, laced with five boundaries and two sixes.Linde found brief support in Brevis, who contributed 14 runs in a 43-run fifth-wicket partnership, but further setbacks followed as Azmatullah Omarzai fell for just one.Delano Potgieter continued his fine form from the season opener, smashing a rapid 44 not out off 22 balls. His knock, featuring four boundaries and three sixes, came in an unbroken 65-run partnership with Linde, propelling MI Cape Town to a respectable 140/6.Despite their spirited effort, the weather ultimately decided the outcome, with JSK emerging triumphant in the rain-curtailed encounter. The victory boosts JSK's campaign as they look to maintain momentum in a highly competitive tournament.","Joburg Super Kings beat MI Cape Town by six runs in SA20 clash.

ILT20: Captain speak on media day ahead of third season

'Get ready for a bigger and better ILT20': Ashish Sehgal

Dubai Capitals secured a dramatic one-run victory over MI Emirates in the opening match of ILT20 Season 3 at the Dubai International Stadium on Saturday. In a contest that went down to the wire, the Capitals overcame a brilliant half-century by Nicholas Pooran to register the narrowest win in the tournament's history.Chasing a modest target of 134, MI Emirates seemed to have the upper hand as they required just 16 runs off the final 15 balls. However, the Capitals' bowling unit, led by Player of the Match Gulbadin Naib , staged a remarkable comeback. Naib bowled with precision, claiming 3 for 13 in his four overs, including the vital wicket of Pooran in the 18th over. Olly Stone, who returned figures of 2 for 14, also played a key role by conceding just one run in the 19th over.The pressure was on the experienced Kieron Pollard to finish the chase in the last over, with MI Emirates needing 13 runs to win. However, Farhan Khan held his nerve, giving away only 11 runs and denying Pollard the finishing touch, as MI Emirates fell short on the final ball of the match.Pooran was the standout performer for MI Emirates, scoring a brilliant 61 off 40 balls, studded with three boundaries and four sixes. After MI Emirates slumped to 23/4 in 4.3 overs, Pooran stitched a crucial 79-run partnership with Akeal Hosein (30 off 31 balls). Their effort revived the innings and brought MI Emirates within touching distance of victory. However, Naib's double strike in the 18th over, including the dismissal of Pooran, turned the game in the Capitals' favour.Earlier, the Dubai Capitals struggled to put up a competitive total, finishing at 133/8 in their 20 overs. Fazalhaq Farooqi was the star with the ball for MI Emirates, claiming an extraordinary five-wicket haul (5 for 15). His clinical performance included a toe-crushing yorker to dismiss Rovman Powell (25 off 20 balls) in the 19th over. Farooqi's late burst also saw him send Dasun Shanaka (13) and Olly Stone back to the pavilion, leaving the Capitals with an underwhelming total to defend.Scottish batter Brandon McMullen was the anchor for the Capitals' innings, scoring a gritty 58 off 42 balls, which included four boundaries and three sixes. McMullen's effort helped the Capitals recover from a slow start after both openers, Shai Hope and Adam Rossington, were dismissed for single-digit scores. Rovman Powell contributed a quickfire 25, but the Capitals struggled to accelerate in the death overs, managing only four runs in the final over.Despite their low total, the Capitals' bowlers stepped up to the occasion.""That is the beauty of cricket and T20,"" said Naib after the match. ""Not a good total on the board, but we defended it, with the guys giving 100%. The pitch was helping the bowlers a lot. Not easy for the batters. We just tried to keep it stump to stump, and we did it.""The thrilling victory sets the tone for an action-packed ILT20 Season 3, promising more edge-of-the-seat moments in the weeks to come.","Dubai Capitals secure dramatic one-run victory over MI Emirates in opening match of ILT20 Season 3.

India are coming off a 1-3 series defeat in Australia and now face England in the limited-overs series at home. Do you think they will be under a lot of pressure?

What’s your prediction for the series?

Do you think England will miss Ben Stokes?

The England series will be an important platform for out-of-form Rohit and Virat to rediscover their touch ahead of the Champions Trophy. What’s your take on this?

You’ve spent considerable time with Bumrah at Mumbai Indians. How crucial a role do you think he will play for India in the Champions Trophy, should he be fit to play?

Is there any upcoming Indian bowler who has particularly impressed you?

DUBAI: All eyes will be on Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli when India take on England in the limited-overs series at home, as both the star batters aim to regain form and get into rhythm ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy next month.India will play five T20Is and three ODIs against England.England left-arm pacer Tymal Mills , currently playing in the ILT20 Season 3 for Gulf Giants in the UAE, believes that Rohit and Virat will soon find their form with the bat. Mills, who has played alongside both the players at Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Mumbai Indians (MI) in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He was part of the RCB squad in 2017 before joining MI in 2022.In an interview with TimesofIndia.com, Mills shared his thoughts on the upcoming India vs England series, Virat and Rohit's form, Bumrah and more.There's always pressure in Indian cricket, as you know. The media gives them high praise and also high scorn, so I'm sure it'll be a great series. A full white-ball tour of India is always a great experience. I've been lucky enough to tour there and play international cricket against India in their home conditions, so it's obviously a very daunting task.They're obviously very strong. Their talent pool is very deep and experienced, but the England team will go there confident. They've got a lot of young players, a lot of players who are keen to express themselves ahead of the Champions Trophy. So I'm sure there'll be a lot of eyes on the series. I'll be keeping an eye on it for sure.England will win both the series — ODIs and T20Is.Yeah, of course. Stokes had another bad hamstring injury, which is a shame. He's obviously one of the best players in the world. Anytime you lose a player like that to injury, it hurts your side. England have a lot of depth and quality, particularly in white-ball cricket. I'm sure guys will be confident in replacing him.You don't get the reputation for scoring the amount of runs these guys (Virat and Rohit) have scored in their careers just by luck. It's because they're two of the best players to have ever played (the sport). They'll be able to ride the highs and the lows better than anybody else, and they'll obviously have a lot of self-belief in their abilities.They've gone through tough times before and come out the other side, and they'll know what they need to do to come out on the other side (once again). Hopefully, not too much against England, but you won't be surprised to see them both scoring runs again.Jasprit is definitely the best bowler in the world across all three formats. He's a special bowler in Test cricket, 50-over cricket and T20s. A lovely guy as well. I really enjoyed my time at Mumbai, spending time with him and speaking to him both on and off the field. Any team that has him is very lucky. He's an excellent bowler in all phases of the game.He's obviously a prized asset, and you have to look after him. If you need to give him rest sporadically to keep him at his best for long periods, then I'm sure they'll do that. He's obviously a fantastic bowler.It's difficult. Obviously, the fast bowler who burst onto the scene in the IPL — Mayank Yadav. Anytime you find a fast bowler like that, it's exciting. I like Arshdeep Singh, the left-arm seamer. I know he's not new or up-and-coming, but he's got great skills and swings the ball both ways. There are lots of fast bowlers in India now who are coming up, improving themselves and getting opportunities in the IPL.",Tymal Mills believes Virat and Rohit will soon find their form with the bat.

We have a Bollywood-style pre-match opening ceremony followed by the opening match of the tournament. The tournament will be fantastic. The planning for the entire event is looking really good. We're expecting great numbers, with a lot of interest and tremendous talent within the teams—not just the international players but also the UAE players. Additionally, I think the associate players will add great value. We have players from Nepal, Malaysia, Namibia, Scotland, and the Netherlands, offering a fantastic array of talent.I think what's unique about the UAE is, firstly, the fantastic facilities, including three world-class stadiums. We're here at the Dubai Stadium now, which is truly top-notch. The weather is great, and the conditions are excellent for cricket, with good wickets and practice facilities. Another unique aspect is that players don't need to travel by plane. They're all based within a compact area and travel by bus, which allows them to bring their families along. Additionally, having nine overseas players in each team makes this league exceptionally strong.What a player! I've known Tim for many, many years. He's not only a fantastic cricketer but also a wonderful person. He'll be a great leader too, and it's fantastic to have him here.You'd need to talk to the BCCI about that (laughs). We know Indian players don't participate in leagues around the world, and that's just how it is. Indian cricket has contributed a lot to the global game, and the IPL, along with the advent of T20s, has been transformative. But yes, for retired Indian players in the future—why not? If they're still fit and able, I'm sure the franchise teams would be interested in them.","Former New Zealand batter David White now holds the position of CEO for the ILT20.

Former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes has defended Indian batsmen Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma after their performance in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. India lost the series 1-3 to Australia.Kohli and Sharma faced criticism for their contributions with the bat. Rhodes suggests that Indian fans might have become accustomed to the team's recent success in Australia. He emphasizes the difficulty of playing in Australian conditions.“Everybody's entitled to their opinion. Cricket is that kind of game and I think the cricket players themselves in this day and age, there is no escape from the public, whether it's fans who love them or fans who are criticizing them with social media, journalism these days. Everybody seems to be a cricketing expert and players learn to live with that,” Rhodes told IANS.Rhodes believes that blaming just two players for the series loss is unfair. He acknowledges India’s previous successes in Australia but reminds fans that those victories were hard-fought. He indicates that this time, the team couldn't replicate those performances.“Touring Australia is really tough. And I think maybe the Indian fans have forgotten that because India have been so successful in the past in their last two tours to Australia. But it wasn't easy. You know, some great performances by the team almost resurrected the previous tours. And it didn't quite happen this time around so to lay the blame at the feet of two people is harsh.”Kohli started the series strongly with a century in the first Test in Perth. However, his form declined, resulting in a total of 190 runs for the series. He was frequently dismissed while chasing deliveries outside off-stump.Rohit Sharma missed the Perth Test due to the birth of his second child. He managed only 31 runs in the three Tests he played. He chose to sit out the final Test in Sydney.Both Kohli and Sharma will be under scrutiny during the 2025 Champions Trophy in February. The tournament will follow a hybrid model after India refused to travel to Pakistan Rhodes declined to comment on the political aspects surrounding the tournament’s arrangements. He expressed his happiness as a fan that India and Pakistan will participate in the Champions Trophy. He believes that missing such a contest would be a loss for all cricket fans.“Fortunately I'm not really involved in the politics of cricket. I'm a big fan of the game and I'm just happy that India are going to be playing Pakistan in this Champions Trophy. Because that sort of game, if it's not taking place, we all as fans lose out a great deal.”Rhodes also praised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s presence at the Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue and National Youth Festival.

Carlo Ancelotti calls on Real Madrid to avoid repeating Clasico mistakes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/carlo-ancelotti-calls-on-real-madrid-to-avoid-repeating-clasico-mistakes/articleshow/117146797.cms,"Carlo Ancelotti (AP Photo)

Real Madrid's coach, Carlo Ancelotti, believes his team can avenge their previous defeat against Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday. He emphasized the importance of learning from past mistakes to secure a victory.Barcelona had convincingly defeated Real Madrid 4-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu in La Liga earlier in the season. However, Real Madrid managed to surpass them in the league standings before the winter break.“We have to think about that game obviously, they beat us, we had a clear evaluation of what happened.”Ancelotti acknowledged the significance of the previous encounter and the need to analyze their performance. He stressed the importance of replicating the positive aspects of their play while avoiding past errors.“We started the game well, then had problems in the second half, so we have to try and repeat the good things we did and avoid the mistakes we made.”The added pressure of a final against their rivals adds another layer of complexity to the upcoming match. Ancelotti acknowledged the unique nature of Clasico finals.“The Clasico is even more pressured when it's a final, we've played a lot against Barcelona and playing a final against them is always something special.”Real Madrid's challenge lies in finding a balance between their attacking prowess and defensive solidity, especially after Kylian Mbappe 's arrival. The attacking quartet of Mbappe, Vinicius Junior, Jude Bellingham, and Rodrygo Goes offers significant offensive firepower. However, their defensive contributions are crucial for team balance.“(In recent Clasicos) individual quality has prevailed over team balance.”Ancelotti highlighted the importance of collective effort and defensive stability in such high-stakes matches.“An important aspect tomorrow will be balance and collective work -- defending.”He firmly believes that a strong defensive performance increases their chances of winning.“If you defend well, there's more chance of winning.”Despite a successful 2024 season with La Liga and Champions League titles, Ancelotti admitted that the heavy defeat against Barcelona remained a low point.“We're close to another trophy, we're thinking positively, but we know that in football anything can happen, above all when the opponent is strong and competes well like Barcelona.”Ancelotti acknowledged the unpredictable nature of football, particularly against a strong opponent like Barcelona. He also highlighted Real Madrid's progress and improvement as a team.“Our team has improved, nobody can argue with that.”He expressed confidence in their continued progress regardless of the outcome of the Super Cup final.“A defeat wouldn't be good but the team is not going backwards, it will keep moving forwards.”Dani Olmo's availability for Barcelona after a controversial temporary license approval by the Spanish national sports council (CSD) presents a challenge for Real Madrid.“Olmo will play and we have to minimise his quality.”Ancelotti chose to focus on minimizing Olmo's impact on the game rather than commenting on the controversy surrounding his eligibility.Barcelona coach Hansi Flick confirmed Olmo's readiness to play but hinted at a possible starting role for Gavi.“Gavi had a great performance against Athletic, he's got confidence... I think he's is going to play, but I am not 100 percent sure of who will play.”The Super Cup final represents Flick's first opportunity to win a trophy with Barcelona. He acknowledged the importance of a victory for the team's confidence.“If we win, we will have more confidence for the rest of the season.”He further emphasized the significance of winning the game for everyone involved.“Winning the game would be something really big for everyone.”",Real Madrid face Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday.

Aston Villa came from behind to end Graham Potter 's debut as West Ham United manager on a losing note in the FA Cup on Friday.West Ham squandered a 1-0 lead to concede twice and lose 1-2 in the third round of the tournament .Potter was appointed as Julen Lopetegui's successor just a day before the match, as West Ham couldn't build on the early advantage after Lucas Paqueta's strike.In bitter cold conditions, Unai Emery's squad demonstrated their resilience with a commanding second-half performance that highlighted West Ham's defensive weaknesses. Amadou Onana drew Villa level before Morgan Rogers struck the decisive goal, leaving Potter visibly dejected.The defeat marked Potter's return to management following his departure from Chelsea in April 2023. His tenure at Stamford Bridge had been brief and challenging, with 11 defeats in 31 matches and a disappointing 11th-place position in the Premier League.With merely one training session before travelling to Villa and the absence of crucial strikers Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio, Potter faced significant challenges.Despite these limitations, the attacking display from West Ham showed promise, though addressing their defensive vulnerabilities remains the primary concern.Lopetegui struggled to maintain the robust framework established by David Moyes, who secured the Europa Conference League in 2023 before departing at the season's conclusion.Potter demonstrated his ability to address these tactical concerns as West Ham displayed impressive attacking prowess against Villa in the first half.Paqueta nearly provided Potter with an ideal beginning when the Brazilian's attempt from the area's periphery narrowly missed the target.It was a warning Villa failed to heed as Paqueta opened the scoring in the ninth minute.Summerville displayed his skill by outmanoeuvring Villa's Maatsen during a decisive run into the box, before delivering a precise pass to Paqueta, who finished expertly past Olsen.The new manager's jubilant celebration was short-lived, as German forward Fullkrug had to leave the pitch with an injury shortly after the goal.Continuing his impressive performance, Paqueta tested Olsen again following another penetrating attack.Villa's persistence after the interval paid off in the 71st minute. A corner kick saw Mings direct the ball towards Maatsen, whose shot was parried by Fabianski into Onana's path, allowing him to score from close range.Villa, sensing an opportunity, pressed forward in the 76th minute. Watkins advanced into West Ham's penalty area and set up Rogers, who finished precisely into the bottom corner.",West Ham squandered a 1-0 lead to concede twice and lose 1-2 in the third round of the tournament.

NEW DELHI: Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta on Friday acknowledged the difficulty of securing impactful January signings to bolster their trophy ambitions as they aim to break a five-year drought.Recent performances, including a 2-0 League Cup semi-final loss to Newcastle and a 1-1 draw against Brighton, highlighted Arsenal's attacking deficiencies.The results have impacted their Premier League title hopes.Winger Bukayo Saka's hamstring injury, requiring surgery and sidelining him until March, further complicates Arteta's attacking options.Arsenal currently trail Premier League leaders Liverpool by six points, with the Reds having a game in hand. However, Arsenal remain well-positioned for Champions League knockout stage progression.Arteta dismissed the notion that simply adding more forwards in January is the solution.

Everton ended ties with manager Sean Dyche on Thursday, but it didn't affect their game on the field in the FA Cup third round, where they defeated League One side Peterborough 2-0.However, Everton, while seeking a manager to replace Dyche, find themselves in another relegation battle in the Premier League, having secured just one victory in their previous 11 fixtures, which came against struggling Wolves in December.They have just three victories in 19 league matches so far to be positioned 16th in the table.On Thursday morning, Dyche visited the Everton training facility to bid farewell after his termination, with his column still appearing in the Peterborough match programme.The team against Peterborough was managed by former Everton full-back Leighton Baines, currently the under-18s coach, alongside club captain Seamus Coleman, utilising Dyche's pre-selected starting eleven.Peterborough nearly secured a surprising first-half advantage when Cian Hayes' low shot was cleared from the goal-line by Jarrad Branthwaite.Beto managed to lift the spirits of Everton's quiet supporters in the 42nd minute when he received Harrison Armstrong's pass in the box, went past Peterborough goalkeeper Nicholas Bilokapic and placed the ball into the unguarded net.Everton faced a setback when their Chelsea loanee striker Armando Broja required oxygen and was carried off the pitch with his right ankle heavily bandaged.The anticipated family moment didn't materialise for Everton's Ashley Young, who was introduced late in the match, whilst his son Tyler, a Peterborough player, remained on the bench.In the final moments, Branthwaite was brought down by Jadel Katongo, leading to Iliman Ndiaye successfully converting the penalty, ensuring Everton's victory in their first match following Dyche's departure.",Everton defeated League One side Peterborough 2-0 in the FA Cup third round. Sean Dyche was sacked as manager of the Toffees on Thursday. The team was managed by former Everton full-back Leighton Baines.

And the most special one was obviously winning the 250 (in Almaty). So, yeah, it's been a great year,"" Rithvik said.If the maiden appearance in a major is a cause for celebration, the optimism is tinged with a bit of caution as he is yet to find a long-term partner. He has tied up with Seggerman only for the Melbourne fortnight.The Hyderabadi was supposed to be in Melbourne Park in tandem with Kadhe, but those plans came to a nought after the latter injured his knee during the Bratislava Challenger and was rendered out of action for at least three months.Rithvik played with Dutch veteran Robin Haase in the season opener in Brisbane and the duo lost in the second round.""Yeah, it's just really, really unlucky for us and especially Arjun for that to happen right after the 250 (Series event) and the way we were playing. It is just very unfortunate. It definitely did affect me as well, because I still don't have a partner,"" Rithvik, who broke into the top-10 with a year-end ranking of 72, said.""I'm glad I got in (to the AO), but it's really different for me to play with different partners in different weeks, because I'm not used to that. So, it's definitely a challenge, and I hope Arjun gets (back) soon on court, recovers pretty well.""A back injury early in his career meant Rithvik chose to play doubles full-time right after college - University of South Florida in the US.He believes breaking into the top-100 is a stepping stone to bigger things ahead.""It's really satisfying to be in the top-100 and climbing up the rankings. But I think it's part of the process for me, and I did believe that this could happen,"" he said.""So I'm definitely happy it's happened, but I'm also hungry for what's coming up, because it's getting exciting playing against higher ranked opponents. Yeah, looking forward to what's coming up, trying to stay healthy and be fit to be able to compete at the highest level.""Rithvik said combining with Haase has been a learning experience for more than one reason.""Playing with Robin was obviously super exciting. It was completely new for me to play with a singles player, because I haven't really done that (until now),"" he said after their outing in Brisbane where the pair lost in the second round.""I mean, he's obviously playing doubles, but he was top-35 in the world in singles and been a top singles player for a very long time. So it was really interesting and really fun to play with him.""I definitely learned quite a lot from Robin. We had a lot of conversations off the court. It was interesting, because he's been on the tour for a very long time, and he shared a couple of experiences, which were super awesome to hear and learn from as well.""He's very open, very friendly, so it was fun time playing with him on court.""Rithvik will have one more first after the Australian Open when he plays in the Davis Cup tie against Togo in New Delhi.""It is a dream for everyone to play in the Davis Cup team. I did play in the junior Davis Cup team, which felt unbelievable when I got selected. But, this one feels better for sure,"" he said.""I'm really excited to be playing alongside Mukund (Sasikumar), Ram (Ramkumar Ramanathan), Karan (Singh) and Bala (Sriram Balaji).""Mukund and I, we've known each other for so many years, and as soon as we got the news, he texted me saying he was very happy for me because we've done this.""We've been doing fitness sessions and stuff when we were very young, and from that to being on the same team representing India is super cool.""",Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli is looking forward to the 2025 season.

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray have known each for approximately 25 years. They were born a week apart. They played each other as juniors when they were all of 12 years old. Upon turning professional, they squared off 36 times, including 10-times in Grand Slams. The Serb won 25 times and now-retired Murray took the other 11. At the majors, that record stood at 8-2.Nowhere did the balance tip more in favour of 37-year-Djokovic than at the Australian Open . They met five times - four finals and a semi-final - and Djokovic held the upper hand each time.Starting Sunday, Murray will not be standing across the net from Djokovic, hoping to overhaul this record. Instead, he will be much-closer to the Serb - in a specially designed ""pod"" which are dedicated for the coaches.The pods, a new feature at the Australian Open which gets underway on 12 January, will allow four members of the player's staff to be able to give them advice. Murray will have access to real-time data and statistics on a screen to make suggestions as Djokovic chases an elusive 25th Grand Slam title.Djokovic had been without a coach since splitting with Goran Ivanisevic in March last year, having won 12 majors together.The call came out of the blue for Murray who was on a golf course when Djokovic proposed the idea. The Briton considered the wild proposition and discussed it with his family before agreeing.“Could never quite get over the line (in Melbourne), unfortunately. This man was single-handedly responsible for that. So I’m now here to try and sabotage his chances of winning another one,” Murray joked.“Novak asked me to help him; I was shocked,” said Murray, who last played at the Paris Olympics in August. “I was obviously not expecting that when he called.”Djokovic agreed that the feeling of having Murray, a former foe, feeding him balls during practice is getting some used to.“I must say, at the beginning, it was a bit of a strange feeling to be able to share the insights with him, not just about the game but about how I feel, about life in general. Not in a negative way, but just in a way I have never done that with him, because he was always one of my greatest rivals,” Djokovic said on Friday. “We were always kind of hiding things from each other. Now all cards are open on the table.”Daniil Medvedev summed up the pairing beautifully by buying a comparison from football. “Imagine (if Lionel) Messi would become the coach of Cristiano Ronaldo. It would be strange,” said the Russian.Is that a hyperbole? Not by a long shot. Djokkovic and Murray comprised two of the 'Big Four' era which also included Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. Djokovic, the only one left standing, owns a men’s-record 24 majors, including 10 at the Australian Open, and has spent the most weeks as World No. 1 in history. Murray, also 37, too occupied the top-rank, owns three major singles trophies, was a Slam runner-up eight times and is the only player to win two Olympic singles gold medals.They are, however, seemingly different personalities. Djokovic has an unconventional belief system and is committed to yoga, meditation and a strict vegan diet. Murray, in comparison, self implodes on the court and would verbally berate himself time and again through his career.Former India No. 1 Somdev Devvarman believes there are a lot more similarities than differences.""Both of them are super fiery. They're fiery with their teams. They're ultra competitive. They are incredible fighters, great problem solvers. Came from a very similar era. They are of the same age, so they look at tennis in a similar way. They are dealing with the perils of the modern game and how big people are hitting the ball and the new style of how it's changed over the last four or five years. They're dealing with it together,"" said Devvarman during a media interaction.""I do feel like there's a lot of similarities. And obviously Novak believed that having somebody like Andy on his side would only be helpful. It would be fun. It would maybe be refreshing, maybe something that he needs at this time in his career. So, obviously, there's a lot of trust between the two of them. Ultimately, Novak is looking to find that little edge that can help him beat a lot of his opponents, and if he believes that Andy Murray can give him that edge, I'm looking forward to watching,"" he added.Djokovic's major trophy cabinet has remained untouched since the 2023 US Open. It was the first time since 2017 that he didn't win a Grand Slam in a season. Yet, the Serb added an Olympic gold - an elusive silverware for a man that had won everything possible.Somdev, who reached a career-high of World No. 62 in 2011 and won three medals at the Asian Games, thinks the partnership will only aid Novak in an attempt at winning his 25th Grand Slam, thereby breaking the tie with Margaret Court in the all-time list.""Novak has taken a leap of faith in his old friend, who he believes has fantastic tennis IQ. He's dedicated, he works hard, and he doesn't leave any stone unturned in order to succeed. To have that sort of energy in your camp, it can mean a lot,"" said Somdev.""It's humbling, honestly, to see it from Novak's perspective that he would ask a friend of such a high standard. And it's even more humbling from Andy's perspective because whenever you take a coaching opportunity, the first thing that you have to understand is when you coach, it's not about you anymore at all. It's always about the player. For a superstar like Andy Murray, to take a backseat speaks a lot about his personality.""So I'm just excited because it's two great personalities in tennis, two great friends, two great characters, and success for them would be success for tennis if it went the right way,"" he concluded.Starting 12th January 2024, watch the first Grand Slam of the year, Australian Open 2025 on Sony Sports Ten 5 SD & HD, Sony Sports Ten 2 SD & HD, Sony Sports Ten 3 SD & HD (Hindi), Sony Sports Ten 4 SD & HD (English) as well as livestream it on Sony LIV, 5:30 AM onwards.",Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray have known each for approximately 25 years.

NEW DELHI: Sumit Nagal is priming for a big match in just the right manner -- on a sun-kissed afternoon, on the very court he is scheduled to play his first-round Australian Open match some 24-hours later -- in Melbourne Park ’s 1573 Arena which has a 3000-strong seating capacity.Nagal, who’ll take on Czech Tomas Machac , the 26seed on Sunday, turned out for practice in a dusty mauve Asics shirt with neon orange branding. The Indian reflected some of that luminous vibe in his shot making, hitting with intent against the world No.47 Zhizhen Zhang, cheered on by a smattering of fans, looking for weekend entertainment.The India No.1, ranked 96 on the Tour, told TOI in an exclusive chat, that he worked hard on his game in the off-season, stepping it up a notch to give his counter-punching play extra zip.“I’m playing well, moving well, I’ve been working a lot on my tennis in the last few weeks, made technical and tactical changes,” Nagal said. “I’ve worked on my footwork -- how you approach the ball, also a little bit of a mindset thing, to be more aggressive, especially on these types of courts. In the last few matches, I’ve started to feel the change. I feel like I'm adapting to it pretty good now.”Nagal, who went down to American Patrick Kypson, ranked outside the top-200, in his first match of the 2025 season, qualified for the main draw in Auckland by putting out Frenchman Adrian Mannarino, once ranked in the top-20, in the final round of the qualifying competition.Against the 24-year-old Machac, Nagal has his work cut out. The gifted Czech, whose penchant to attack the net, is backed by a versatile backhand that sets up the moves for him, is also quick around the court.“He’s a very good player, he’s playing his best tennis right now,” Nagal said. “He likes to play fast tennis, come to the net, these courts suit him. I need to push him physically, make the rallies longer. If I can do that, I see chances.”The 27-year-old has been smart with choice of practice partners this week, going for the aggressive players, the disrupters of rhythm that is so fundamental to his style of play. He hit with Nick Kyrgios on Friday.“It's been a while since I’ve seen him (Kyrgios), we’ve always had a hi-hello sort of friendship, a quick chat, how are you doing, kind of thing,” Nagal said. “We share a couple of common interests, gaming and Indian food. He loves Indian food. We always have something to talk about, either a new game or a new restaurant in the cities we meet in.”That’s the chatter, as Nagal will tell you, content is everything, all that is played between the lines.",Sumit Nagal will play his first-round Australian Open match on Sunday.

Carlos Alcaraz , who can play any shot in tennis, those in the book and then some out of it, even making stuff up on the run, was asked what gives him the greatest satisfaction as a professional athlete -- playing a particular shot or coming through tight matches.The 21-year-old – performer par excellence -- answered with a crackling smile before turning to words.“When you feel like you can’t miss,” the Spaniard said, “you hit great shots, running forehands, dropshots, volley, serve and volley, everything that you want to do, you feel like it's going to be right, that's the most satisfaction I feel on the court.”The four-time major winner craves the magic more than he does match wins, it's how his victories are designed.Alcaraz, the world No.3, who kicks off his Australian Open campaign against Russian Alexander Shevchenko on Monday, is looking for the only major title that has eluded him in his bid for a career Grand Slam.Alcaraz, who went out to German Alexander Zverev in the quarterfinals last year, looking out of depth without his long-time coach Juan Carlos Ferrero, who underwent knee surgery, is hoping to make amends this time with the former No.1 back in his corner.The Spaniard, in the same half of the draw as the No.2 seed Zverev this time, could run into the 10-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals, and will only meet the world No.1 Jannik Sinner if the two make the final.Alcaraz leads that riveting rivalry – fire and ice, genius and grit -- 6-4, having beaten the Italian three times last year in a season in which the 23-year-old won two major titles at Melbourne Park and later at the US Open.“When I'm playing against Jannik, I have a different mindset,” Alcaraz said. “When you are facing the best player in the world, you have to do something different. When I'm facing him, I know that I have to play my best if I want to win. That’s it. If I have a bad day against Jannik, it’s 99 percent that you're going to lose. That's what is on my mind every time I play him.”Sinner and Alcaraz split the majors between themselves in 2024.“When I see him win titles, see him on top of the ranking, it forces me to practice even harder,” Alcaraz said. “In practice, I'm just thinking about the things that I have to improve to play against him. That is great for me, having him, having such a great rivalry so far, to give the best of me every day.”Alcaraz, who arrived in Melbourne Park this time with not only Ferrero, but also a second coach in Samuel Lopez, has tweaked his serve to get greater rhythm.“One of the big issues I have on the serve is the rhythm. I didn't get good rhythm. With this one I'm going to get a good rhythm just to hit in the right spot every time,” said Alcaraz. “I have to improve my precision, be more precise on the serve. A good rhythm will help.”Last season the Spaniard sent down 265 aces and won 85 percent of the 709 service games he played. That’s the level of precision the 21-year-old is looking to top, it’s down to the nanometre.",Carlos Alcaraz opens his Australian Open campaign against Alexander Shevchenko on Monday.

MELBOURNE: Novak Djokovic 's shocking claim of being poisoned at a Melbourne hotel in January 2022, where he was detained after arriving in Australia without taking the Covid-19 vaccination, came to light on Friday.In a recent interview the 37-year-old Serb said he was served food contaminated with high levels of lead and mercury.Djokovic, who had his visa revoked and was deported from the country, made the sensational claims in an interview to GQ magazine. The Serb said some of the food he received contained lead and mercury.""I had some health issues, and I realized that in that hotel in Melbourne, I was fed with some food that poisoned me,"" the 24-time major winner said. ""I had some discoveries when I came back to Serbia. I never told this to anybody publicly, but I had a high level of heavy metal. I had a very high level of lead and mercury.""When asked if he had evidence to link the heavy metal blood levels to food served in the hotel, Djokovic said, ""The GQ article came out online yesterday (Thursday), I think it's a February issue, so it's coming out in print version. I've done that interview many months ago. I would appreciate not talking more in detail about that, as I would like to focus on the tennis and why I'm here.""Djokovic added, ""If you want to see what I've said and get more information on that, you can always revert to the article.""Djokovic received support from the outspoken Aussie Nick Kyrgios , who said, ""I haven't spoken to him (Djokovic), I didn't even know that.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has scheduled a hearing on April 16-17 for world number one Jannik Sinner regarding doping allegations, as announced by the Lausanne-based organisation on Friday.Following Sinner's positive tests for clostebol, a prohibited steroid, in March last year, the World Anti-Doping Agency has challenged the International Tennis Integrity Agency's (ITIA) decision to clear him.The hearing will be private, with CAS confirming that no parties requested a public session.The ITIA had previously accepted Sinner's explanation that the substance entered his system via his physiotherapist's use of a spray containing clostebol during treatment and subsequent therapy sessions.Prior to the Australian Open , the 23-year-old champion expressed uncertainty about the timing of the verdict, stating: ""I know exactly as much as you guys know. We are in a stage where we don't know many, many things.""Facing Chilean Nicolas Jarry in the first round at Melbourne Park, Sinner acknowledged the ongoing impact of the situation: ""You think about this, of course. I would lie if I would tell you I forget. It's something what I have with me now already for quite a long time. But it is what it is. I'm here trying to prepare the Grand Slam. Let's see how it goes.""Emphasising his cautious approach, Sinner explained: ""I've always been very, very careful on every single medicine I take, even what I eat. When the bottle is open, I throw it away, I take a new one. In my mind I know exactly what happened, and that's how I block it (out). I haven't done anything wrong, that's why I'm still here. That's why I'm still playing.""","Court of Arbitration for Sport has scheduled a hearing for world number one Jannik Sinner.

The skies are blue and the sun is unapologetically brazen, not uncommon in the Antipodes this time of the year. Melbourne Park , the sprawling grounds of the Happy Slam, overlooks the Yarra, gliding gently alongside a shimmering carpet.The Australian Open , starting Sunday, is held far from the ructions of a world in a twirl, but even thousands of aeronautical miles isn’t quite far enough for tennis, struggling to move forward from issues of the past year. Ostensibly, a pair of gold standard 23-year-olds, World No. 1 Jannik Sinner and five-time major winner Iga Swiatek , returned positive tests that rocked the core of the game.Sinner, the Australian Open’s defending champion tested positive for clostebol last March. An independent panel, which was presented the case by the International Tennis Integrity Agency, ruled there was ‘no fault or negligence’ on the part of the Italian.The verdict that Sinner bore no fault didn’t sit well with the World Anti-Doping Agency , who in the era of XXL entourages, harps on independent thinking, especially with all that athletes put in their system. Not even a billionth of a gram.WADA has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the Italian faces a potential ban of up to two years. The hearing could be slated for February after the conclusion of the first major of the year, but there could be appeals at a higher port, the Swiss Tribunal.Swiatek, the four-time Roland Garros champion, tested positive for trimetazidine in August. The sleep medication she was taking was contaminated.Tennis couldn’t have imagined a darker quandary in the New Year, given that the younger generation of champions had served notice of a new order last season.Sinner and Swiatek, who’ve been careful about everything they put in their body, came out with resilient masks on Media Day on Friday, saying, not much has changed for them.“I’ve done the same thing,” Sinner said. “Before I was very, very careful with every single medicine I took, even what I eat. When the bottle is open, I throw it away, I take a new one.”Swiatek, the four-time Roland Garros champion, who is playing down under with a new coach Belgian Wim Fissette, said, “The contaminated thing was a medication, and medications are treated as tested and clean. The weirdest thing is that the contamination level was ok by Polish pharmaceutical law, but it's not okay in our doping law.”Nick Kyrgios, who has unequivocally taken aim at Sinner, has stopped at nothing – personal or professional.“Having two number ones implicated in doping is abhorrent for our sport,” Kyrgios told reporters in Brisbane. “Right now the state of tennis integrity is widely acknowledged to be terrible – no one seems willing to address it, but it truly is unacceptable. We owe it to the sport to be vocal about it.”The volatile Aussie is backed by Djokovic, going for a historic 25th major title at Melbourne Park, and will open his campaign for a record-equalling 11th Australian Open crown against Indian-American Nishesh Basavareddy.The 37-year-old said, “I'm questioning the way the system works, why certain players are not treated the same as other players.”Interestingly, Sinner, who starts his campaign on Tuesday against Nicolas Jarry, who had tested positive for Lindanrol and Stanozolal and was suspended from the Tour for ten months from January 2020. He was subsequently cleared as the ITF ruled that Jarry ‘bore no significant fault or negligence for his violation’.Sinner, who wore his unruly crown and a blank expression like a model on a catwalk, didn’t give much away.“I haven't done anything wrong, that's why I'm still here,” the world No.1 said. “I don't want to respond to what Nick said or what other players say. The most important part is to have my people around me, they know exactly what happened.”Djokovic’s glittering trophy cabinet should serve as an example for Sinner. The Serb, not really a fan favourite, especially in a cast that included rockstar figures Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, channelled his energies into winning, Grand Slam after Grand Slam, owning record after record, silencing raging crowds with his inner steel. In doing so he delivered a message that said, love means nothing in tennis, titles are everything.Sinner wouldn’t want to be known only as a two-time major winner, and Swiatek, a five-time champion, the shine and sparkle of silverware could wipe the smudge off their names. Melbourne Park is as good a place as any to get that going again.","World No. 1 Jannik Sinner and five-time major winner Iga Swiatek return positive tests. Sinner, the Australian Open’s defending champion tested positive for clostebol last March. WADA has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the Italian faces a potential ban of up to two years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117120957,imgsize-33404,width-400,resizemode-4/117120957.jpg"

Indian badminton duo Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty 's journey at the Malaysia Super 1000 tournament concluded in the semifinals. They were defeated by the Korean pair of Kim Won Ho and Seo Seung Jae .The seventh-seeded Indian pair, who were finalists in the previous edition, lost 10-21, 15-21 in a 40-minute match.“They played really well, and we could have followed our game plan a bit better. Instead, we played some random strokes, but kudos to them for playing a solid game.”Satwik acknowledged the Koreans' strong performance and admitted their own shortcomings in executing their strategy. He also praised the opponents' solid gameplay.“Today, the pace of the game was very slow compared to the last three days. It’s part of the game. It was a valuable learning experience for us. It is disappointing, but we have a long way to go. Today’s match showed that we can still make it a good fight.”Satwik reflected on the slower pace of the game compared to previous matches. He emphasized the learning experience and the positive takeaway of being competitive despite the loss.The Asian Games champions faced an early setback, trailing 6-11 at the mid-game interval of the first game.They couldn't recover from the deficit, and the Korean pair secured the first game swiftly in 19 minutes.In the second game, Satwik and Chirag displayed improved control and intent. They took an 11-8 lead at the interval.However, they lost momentum, enabling the Korean duo to regain control and win the match comfortably.Kim and Seo have rejoined forces for the 2025 season after achieving success with different partners.Seo won the world title with Kang Min Hyuk in 2023 and previously attained a world No. 7 ranking with Choi Sol Gyu. Kim secured a mixed doubles silver medal with Jeong Na-eun at the Paris Olympics.“They both are playing like a mixed doubles pair now, which is making it tougher.”Satwik humorously observed the playing style of the Korean pair, comparing it to a mixed doubles partnership, which posed a greater challenge.“They are not giving away any easy points, and that’s their best quality. We have to work hard for every point, and that’s exactly what happened today.”He highlighted the Koreans' strength of not conceding easy points, forcing them to work hard for every point.Satwik, whose participation has been limited after the Paris Games due to injuries, suggested that a more assertive approach and mind games might have been beneficial.“We were working really hard, but they were taking easy points whenever they wanted, which kept the pressure off them. In the first game, and even in the second, despite us leading, they maintained their confidence.”Satwik pointed out that despite their efforts, the Koreans' ability to score easy points kept the pressure off them and maintained their confidence.“They could take any point at any time. I think maybe some mind games could have worked here and there. We started a bit calmer, thought the game would come to us, but we could have shown a little more attitude on the court and played with a little more fire.”He reflected on the need for a more aggressive and strategic approach from the start of the match.“I think we started to be a little calmer in the second game. But credit to them, I think we gave away a few easy points from 11-8, but they were also serving quite well.”Chirag acknowledged their calmer approach in the second game but credited the Koreans' serving and their own errors.Satwik and Chirag haven't played extensively since the Olympics.Their next tournament is the India Open Super 750 , commencing on January 14. They will face Malaysia's Wei Chong Man and Kai Wun Tee in the first round.“Really excited. It’s our home tournament and we would really want to go, play well there, and go as deep into the tournament as possible.”Chirag expressed his excitement about playing in their home tournament and their aim to perform well and progress as far as possible.","Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty lost 10-21, 15-21 to Kim Won Ho and Seo Seung Jae.

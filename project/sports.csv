Sri Lanka snatched victory from the jaws of defeat to claim their first win of the Women's World Cup, edging out Bangladesh by seven runs in a thrilling finish in Navi Mumbai on Monday. With Bangladesh cruising—needing just nine runs off the final over with five wickets in hand and having scored only three off the penultimate over—skipper Chamari Athapaththu took the ball herself and completely turned the game around.Four wickets fell in four balls as Bangladesh collapsed, losing five wickets for just two runs.Athapaththu, calm under pressure, finished with career-best figures of 4-42.The drama began with Rabeya Khan trapped leg before wicket on the first delivery, followed immediately by a run-out.Bangladesh’s hopes took another blow when captain Nigar Sultana advanced down the track only to be caught at long-off.When Marufa Akter was adjudged lbw on the next ball, Athapaththu had achieved the unthinkable, defending nine runs while conceding just one in the over.""We handled the pressure well. We knew that if we took the game deep, teams could crumble,"" Athapaththu said. ""It wasn't perfect, batting collapses and dropped catches hurt us, but luck smiled at us today.""Fortune finally favoured Sri Lanka, whose campaign had so far been plagued by rain interruptions, missed opportunities, and inconsistent batting.Hasini Perera, who struck her maiden ODI half-century, scored 85 off 99 balls, including 13 fours and a six. She anchored Sri Lanka’s total of 202 all out and reached the milestone of 1,000 ODI runs.A 74-run partnership with Nilakshika de Silva gave Sri Lanka a strong start, but another collapse saw six wickets fall for just 28 runs.Even so, the Sri Lankans held their nerve in the final overs to seal the win and climb to sixth in the standings.With four points, they are level with New Zealand and India, though they will need other results to go their way to secure the last semi-final spot. Australia, South Africa, and England have already booked places in the last four.""We kept losing wickets at crucial times,"" admitted Bangladesh skipper Sultana, whose fighting 77 went in vain as her side were eliminated. ""I tried to take the pressure off with a boundary, but it just didn't come off.""","Sri Lanka snatch victory from the jaws of defeat to claim their first win of the Women's World Cup, edging out Bangladesh by seven runs in a thrilling finish in Navi Mumbai on Monday.

India’s opening ODI against Australia at Perth was largely one-sided, as the visitors struggled to make an impact. The top-order, including Rohit Sharma (8), Virat Kohli (0), and captain Shubman Gill (10), faltered under overcast and seaming conditions after being put in to bat. After Gill’s dismissal, rain interruptions on four occasions further disrupted India’s innings. The most meaningful partnership came from KL Rahul (38) and Axar Patel (31), who added 39 runs with calculated intent. Nitish Kumar Reddy showcased his six-hitting ability with two towering maximums, but India could manage only 136 for 9 in a 26-over match.Indian fans turned out in large numbers at Optus Stadium to support their side, but the failures of Rohit and Kohli highlighted an ordinary outing. Rohit, playing his 500th match for India, began with a crisp straight drive off Mitchell Starc reminiscent of his past glory but was dismissed by Josh Hazlewood, whose steep bounce caught the edge for a catch at second slip by debutant Matthew Renshaw.Kohli, cheered loudly as he walked in, could not produce his usual ODI form. A prod outside off-stump from Starc eventually drew an edge, which was caught by Cooper Connolly at backward point, ending Kohli’s brief eight-ball innings.Former India player Irfan Pathan said it looked like the demons of the BGT were back for Kohli.""Fitness is one thing and game time is one thing. That is why Rohit looked a bit troubled. It looked like the demons of the BGT were back for Virat. I hope this is not the case in Adelaide and Sydney. KL Rahul batted well today. Shreyas Iyer got into an awkward position. Maybe he can work a bit more on his technique. Axar does well whenever he gets an opportunity to bat ahead,"" he said on his YouTube channel.""Whenever you tour such countries, it is always better to go early and play some games. It was going to be difficult for India. It was going to be a challenge as the conditions would not be easy. Our bowlers could not get the right lengths. The batters also had trouble with the bounce. If you had played a game or two, these mistakes would not have happened. It is important to think about these things going forward.""",India's opening ODI against Australia at Perth was largely one-sided. The top- order faltered under overcast and seaming conditions.

Poll What do you think of Tanvi Sharma's performance at the BWF World Junior Championships? Outstanding, she showed great potential Good, but could improve under pressure Average, not what I expected Disappointing, she should have won gold

After playing a pivotal role in helping India win a historic bronze in the team event of the BWF World Junior Championships, Tanvi Sharma played her heart out to reach the girls’ singles final in Guwahati.With gold in sight, the 16year-old eventually fell short, going down to Thailand’s Anyapat Phichitpreechasak 7-15, 12-15 in the summit clash at the National Centre of Excellence on Sunday.“I am very happy with the silver medal but a little disappointed that I didn’t get the gold. I played very well and was confident about the final also, but it didn’t happen,” Tanvi told TOI after the match.Despite the heartbreak, she became only the fifth Indian to bag a silver in the competition after Aparna Popat (1996), Saina Nehwal (2006), Siril Verma (2015) and Sankar Muthuswamy (2022).Anyapat, who Tanvi had beaten in the semifinals of the 2023 Badminton Asia U17 & U15 Junior Championships, did not allow the Indian to settle this time, taking the first game in just nine minutes. In the second, Tanvi led 6-1 and 8-5 at the break, but a string of errors and mounting pressure saw the Thai opponent seize control again.“I was in a comfortable position, but suddenly I started making mistakes. I also got nervous because of the big stadium and the crowd,” said Tanvi, who has been training at the NCE for a year now.Her coach Park Taesang kept urging her to play long rallies, but the momentum had already swung. “He told me to play my game and stay in the rallies to get points. There are days when I make these mistakes, so I need to work on that — especially on my net play and endurance,” she said.Tanvi’s performance over the past week, however, has been a huge positive for India’s junior badminton setup. Her poise, movement, and shot selection throughout the event have impressed coaches and selectors alike, marking her out as one of the most promising shuttlers to emerge from the new National Centre of Excellence programme.Having already shown her ability to handle pressure on the world stage, the teenager now aims to break into the senior circuit. “This result gives me confidence that I can compete at the next level,” Tanvi said. “I’ll keep improving and work on consistency so I can do well in the senior tournaments too.”Tanvi credited her mother Meena and coach Park for their unwavering support. “My coach was very happy after the semifinal and asked me to just play my game in the final without thinking about the result. My mother has always guided me and travels with me everywhere,” she added.As for the boys’ singles final, China’s Liu Yang Ming Yu beat top seed Mohd Zaki Ubaidillah of Indonesia 15-10, 15-11 to clinch the title. China’s Tan Ke Xuan and Wei Yue Yue took the girls’ doubles crown, while Korea’s Lee Hyeong Woo and Cheon Hye In won the mixed doubles title.","Tanvi Sharma loses to Thailand’s Anyapat Phichitpreechasak 7-15, 12-15 in the summit clash at the National Centre of Excellence in Guwahati.

Axar, Rahul infuse momentum

Australia’s forward Marsh

Poll What do you think contributed most to India's defeat in the first ODI? Underperformance of key players like Rohit and Kohli Ineffective bowling attack Poor conditions due to rain interruptions Strong performance by the Australian team

The numerous rain breaks made it a long day in Perth. But for many who curtailed their pre-Diwali Sunday morning slumber to catch up on the action, the day was done around breakfast time. The seven-wicket defeat at 4.40 pm IST was more academic as the Aussies went 1-0 up in the three-match series.Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, looking to prolong their international careers till the 2027 ODI World Cup, looked rusty in their combined stay of 22 balls at the crease at a time when the sun was still out. The interrogation around the off-stump by Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc that curtailed their Test careers 11 months ago proved too much for the two greats even with the white ball. Rohit (8) nicked Hazlewood’s delivery that jumped a bit from a good length, and Matt Renshaw at slip had an easy grab.Starc bowled a few slightly full to Kohli, walking in at No. 3, and then held the length back just a bit for one. It got the outer half of the 51-ton man’s bat, and Cooper Connolly at gully did the needful. Reduced to 21-2 in 6.1 overs—a run-rate that read ridiculously low for those getting used to Abhishek Sharma’s diet in Powerplay—it was crucial that captain Shubman Gill got going.But Gill (10) nicked one down the leg by medium-pacer Nathan Ellis on his first ball, and the task got all the more uphill for the rest of the batting unit. It was around this time that the heavens opened up for the first time, and the stoppages kept repeating in a loop, with overs getting curtailed.There was a bit of interest around new vice-captain Shreyas Iyer as well, but he too, in between the stoppages, failed to negotiate his nemesis—the short ball around his armpits. Iyer (11) nicked Hazlewood (2-20), who hit an impeccable length and bowled seven overs on the trot, and wicket-keeper Josh Phillippe completed a smart catch.Amidst these mishaps, the class of KL Rahul shone through once again. Not too long ago, he was busy guiding India to a Test series win on a slow turner at Kotla. The Optus pitch is as far removed from Kotla as New Delhi is from Perth, but it was hardly a bother for the Bengaluru boy. Rahul (38 off 31 balls) didn’t look perturbed by the quality of the Aussie pace attack or the rain breaks, as the match finally settled down to be a 26-over affair. The right-hander’s 39-run partnership with the gutsy Axar Patel (31) did infuse a little bit of life into the Indian innings, but the damage was already done. Still, they did unleash the odd powerful shot, and one can hope once the conditions get easier in Adelaide, things will get better for the Indian batters.To make a 131-run target look menacing, India needed more than the odd wicket in the initial overs. But on the Optus pitch, which had become quite spicy with the moisture and the lights coming on, India sorely missed Jasprit Bumrah. Mohammed Siraj was his usual wholehearted self while Arshdeep Singh had Travis Head early, but the Indian attack lacked the cutting edge that could run through Australia.Skipper Mitchell Marsh 46* (52 b), after initial belligerence, curtailed himself after a couple of wickets, knowing well that there is a lot of inexperience around the Australian middle-order. Among the pacers, Harshit Rana (027 off 4) was the most disappointing, dishing out the odd loose ball every over, which took the pressure off Marsh and the young Phillippe (37). Their 55-run third-wicket stand killed the game.By the end, it became a stroll in the park. Like the Aussies had on Nov 19, 2023.","Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli looked rusty in their combined stay of 22 balls at the crease.

NEW DELHI: India captain Harmanpreet Kaur described her team's narrow four-run defeat to England as ""heartbreaking"", admitting that despite dominating large parts of the contest, they once again failed to cross the finish line in their Women's World Cup group encounter on Sunday. With Smriti Mandhana scoring a fluent 88 and India needing just 56 runs off 54 balls with seven wickets in hand, they seemed on course for victory. But England fought back brilliantly, securing their fourth successive win and confirming a semifinal berth alongside Australia and South Africa.""Smriti's wicket was the turning point for us. It’s a heartbreaking moment,"" Harmanpreet said at the post-match presentation.While Mandhana and Harmanpreet were at the crease, India appeared in control, but neither could anchor the chase.Earlier, Heather Knight’s 109 had anchored England’s total of 288/8, before India fell agonisingly short at 284/6. Left-arm spinner Linsey Smith triggered a collapse, dismissing Mandhana against the run of play. Deepti Sharma’s composed fifty had kept India’s hopes alive after Mandhana’s departure, but Sophie Ecclestone’s dismissal of the all-rounder in the closing overs sealed England’s victory.""It’s a bad feeling when you have put so much hard work in but the last 5-6 overs didn’t go according to the plan,” Harmanpreet added.“We still had batters, but I don’t know how things went the other way. Credit to England. They didn’t lose hope, they kept bowling and getting wickets.”The defeat, India’s third in a row following losses to South Africa and Australia, has left the co-hosts and pre-tournament favourites on the brink of elimination. In all three matches, India had been in winning positions but failed to close out. Against Australia, they couldn’t defend 330, while South Africa chased down 251 despite being seven wickets down.“We are playing good cricket, we are not giving up, but have to cross the line. It’s been the last three games where we showed up with good cricket, but ended up on losing side,” Harmanpreet said. “Our bowlers did a really good job, because when Heather was batting they were looking very good. (We) did a lot right, but last five overs, we have to rethink.”India now face New Zealand in a must-win clash in Navi Mumbai on Thursday, followed by their final group match against Bangladesh on October 26. Victories in both, along with favourable results elsewhere, are crucial to keeping their semi-final hopes alive.“Next game is very important,” the India captain added.","India captain Harmanpreet Kaur described her team's narrow four-run defeat to England as ""heartbreaking"" The defeat, India’s third in a row following losses to South Africa and Australia, has left the co-hosts and pre-tournament favourites on the brink of elimination.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan took advantage of poor catching by South Africa to post 259-5 on the opening day of the second and final Test in Rawalpindi on Monday. Had the tourists held onto the five chances they dropped on a turning pitch, they would have been in a stronger position after Pakistan won the toss and opted to bat. Skipper Shan Masood , dropped on 71 off a luckless Keshav Maharaj, top-scored with 87, while Abdullah Shafique , who was dropped four times, made 57.Saud Shakeel and Salman Agha will resume on Tuesday unbeaten on 42 and 10 respectively, with Pakistan seeking a 2-0 series win over the world Test champions.South African pacer Kagiso Rabada provided some respite for his team by trapping Mohammad Rizwan for 19 with the fifth delivery after the second new ball.Maharaj, who missed the first Test in Lahore due to injury, finished with figures of 2-63, while fellow spinner Simon Harmer took 2-75.Despite the bulk of the bowling coming from Maharaj and Harmer, spinner Senuran Muthusamy, who took 11 wickets in the first Test, was surprisingly used for just four overs.The final session saw Masood fall to an uppish sweep off Maharaj, caught by Marco Jansen, after an innings that included two fours and three sixes.Earlier, Shafique’s chancy innings ended when he edged Harmer to wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne, after adding an invaluable 111-run partnership with Masood for the second wicket.Struggling batter Babar Azam, cheered on by a supportive home crowd, was dismissed for just 16 when Tony de Zorzi took a low catch at silly point for Maharaj’s first wicket. Azam has now gone 29 Test innings without a century.Maharaj had also dropped Shafique on 15, and Aiden Markram let him off on 41 and 53. Shafique even survived on nine when a Jansen delivery rolled onto the stumps but failed to dislodge the bails.Shafique admitted he had been fortunate.""You need luck in cricket and I was lucky today,"" he said. ""Catches get dropped in cricket and today we benefitted from them and now we need to post a 350-plus total from here.""In the morning session, South Africa’s only breakthrough came from Harmer, who bowled Imam-ul-Haq for 17 with a sharp turner that beat the bat and hit off-stump. Rabada was also unlucky when Tristan Stubbs dropped Shafique in the slips off the fourth ball of the match when he was on nought.""It was an even day because we controlled their run rate,"" said Maharaj. ""We know how important are catches but no-one means to drop catches although it was frustrating.""Having won the first Test in Lahore by 93 runs, Pakistan included a third spinner, Asif Afridi, dropping fast bowler Hasan Ali.At 38 years and 299 days, Asif became the second oldest Pakistani Test debutant, behind Miran Bakhsh, who debuted at 47 years and 284 days against India in 1955.","Pakistan take advantage of poor catching by South Africa to post 259-5 on opening day of second and final Test in Rawalpindi.

Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill struggle as India falter in first ODI vs Australia

England secured a commanding 65-run victory over New Zealand in the second T20 international at Christchurch's Hagley Oval on Monday, led by Harry Brook 's powerful 78.England posted an impressive total of 236-4 in their 20 overs after New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner chose to field first.Phil Salt and Harry Brook dominated the innings while New Zealand's fielding performance was below par, with multiple misfields, poor throws, and dropped catches.The hosts missed crucial opportunities when Tim Seifert dropped Jacob Bethell off a top edge in the strong northwest wind, and James Neesham later dropped Brook.Brook's dropped catch proved costly as he went on to score 78 from 35 balls, forming a substantial 129-run partnership with Salt.Shortly after being dropped, Brook demonstrated his power by hitting a massive pull shot that travelled over 100 meters beyond the midwicket boundary.""It felt good,"" Brook said, after the opening match of the series on Saturday was washed out. ""It's always nice to contribute. It was just nice to get some runs out there and hit a couple out of the park.""Brook's innings included six fours and five sixes before he was caught at long-on attempting a lofted drive.Salt played a measured innings of 85 from 56 balls, rotating the strike effectively and capitalising on loose deliveries.""It's always nice to contribute. It was just nice to get some runs out there and hit a couple out of the park,"" Brook said about their partnership strategy of staying ""calm and composed"" while ""looking to manipulate the field and put them under as much pressure as possible.""Tom Banton contributed a quick 29 from 12 balls at the end, helping England achieve Christchurch's highest T20 total.New Zealand's chase began poorly, losing Tim Robinson and Rachin Ravindra in the second over.Seifert and Mark Chapman provided some resistance with a 69-run partnership, but their dismissals around the 10-over mark effectively ended New Zealand's hopes.England's bowlers Adil Rashid (4-32), Liam Dawson (2-38), and Brydon Carse (2-27) maintained tight control as New Zealand were dismissed for 171.The series continues with the third T20 match scheduled for Thursday night at Eden Park in Auckland.","England beat New Zealand by 65 runs in second T20 international in Christchurch.

Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, R Ashwin, Cheteshwar Pujara retire... who next?

MUMBAI: Parvez Rasool , the first player from Jammu & Kashmir to represent India in international cricket and also the first from the region to feature in the IPL , on Saturday retired from all formats of the game.In an epic 17-year career, during which he played first-class cricket for 15 seasons (he was out of the J&K team for the last two seasons), Rasool, an off-spinning all-rounder, claimed 352 wickets at 27.21 in 95 matches and amassed 5,648 runs at 38.95, with 16 hundreds and 22 fifties. The 36-year-old, who hails from Bijbehara in Kashmir, was one of the most consistent performers at the domestic level, though his international career did not last beyond two games for India — a solitary T20I (vs England in Kanpur in January 2017) and one ODI (against Bangladesh in June 2014).“Yes, I've retired from cricket. Obviously, playing for India was the proudest moment of my life. Coming from J&K, which wasn't known much for cricket, I went on to win the Lala Amarnath Trophy for the best all-rounder in the Ranji Trophy on two occasions (in 2013-14 and 2017-18), and became the first from my region to play for India and in the IPL. I feel nice to have contributed to the game,"" Rasool told TOI.He is now serious about pursuing a career in cricket coaching.“Moving forward, I've cleared my Level-II (coaching certificate from the BCCI Centre of Excellence). I want to do full-time coaching, contribute to Indian cricket and pass on what I’ve learnt from my experience to young cricketers. I want the youngsters to get a chance. You have to retire at some point,"" he said.Talking about how he made a difference in inspiring J&K cricketers — their team beat Mumbai last season in the Ranji Trophy and recently lost to the domestic giants by just 35 runs — Rasool said, “When I started playing cricket, no one knew about J&K cricket. Thanks to the Almighty, we qualified twice for the quarterfinals of the Ranji Trophy under my captaincy. In fact, I captained J&K for six consecutive years. I'm so happy to see that today, our boys look to compete in domestic cricket, while earlier they would just come to participate,"" Rasool said.He doesn’t regret the fact that he couldn’t play for J&K in the last two seasons. “All these things happen. Going forward, I'm looking to contribute by coaching and playing a bit of cricket (in overseas T20 leagues).”During his T20I debut, Rasool was at the centre of a controversy when a video grab showed him chewing gum while the national anthem was being played before the match. Clarifying the incident, Rasool said: “I was part of the India squad for eight matches before that — five games in Zimbabwe and three against Bangladesh. I didn't do that deliberately. Someone who comes from a relatively smaller cricketing region knows how much hard work it takes to play for India one day. Why would anyone do that kind of thing intentionally to destroy his career? That would be madness.”Back in 2012-13, Rasool was the standout performer for J&K as he ended the season with 594 runs and 33 wickets, which earned him a place in the Indian team and a contract with the now-defunct IPL franchise Pune Warriors, led by former India captain Sourav Ganguly.Rasool regrets that he couldn’t play more for India. “Definitely, that regret is there. I played two white-ball matches for India, but I wanted to play Test cricket, especially after I took seven for 45 for Board President’s XI against Australia (in Chennai, February 2013). However, this is destiny. You try hard to do well. Thanks to the Almighty, I have a tremendous record for J&K with bat and ball. I've scored 10,470 runs and taken more than 623 wickets across all formats in my career. As I said, I'm now looking forward to my new role in coaching,"" Rasool concluded.Will he want to coach J&K? “If I get a chance, definitely,” he said.","Pervez Rasool was the first player from Jammu & Kashmir to represent India in international cricket. The 36-year-old, who hails from Bijbehara in Kashmir, was one of the most consistent performers at the domestic level. Rasool claimed 352 wickets at 27.21 in 95 matches and amassed 5,648 runs at 38.95.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124703040,imgsize-28856,width-400,resizemode-4/parvez-rasool-toi-photo.jpg"

‘Unnecessary!’ – Former India captain slams Deepti Sharma following India’s World Cup defeat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-womens-world-cup-2025/unnecessary-former-india-captain-slams-deepti-sharma-following-indias-world-cup-defeat/articleshow/124701260.cms,"Smriti Mandhana of India speaks to teammate Deepti Sharma (R) during the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup (Photo by Pankaj Nangia/Getty Images)

Former India skipper Anjum Chopra criticised all-rounder Deepti Sharma’s approach as Team India suffered their third consecutive defeat in the Women’s ODI World Cup, narrowly falling short by just four runs against England on Sunday.While captain Harmanpreet Kaur and vice-captain Smriti Mandhana played outstanding innings, India’s batting collapsed after Mandhana’s dismissal, derailing a promising chase. Chopra pointed out that Deepti, despite a composed knock, gave her wicket away to Sophie Ecclestone while attempting a lofted shot toward the biggest boundary—something she deemed “completely unnecessary.”“It was virtually a run-a-ball equation. You have to understand how much hard work goes into getting your team into such a position. That 125-run partnership between Harmanpreet and Smriti was brilliant. They absorbed pressure and gave India control. But after reaching milestones, the concentration just slipped. Look at Smriti’s innings, from 5 to 50, and then 50 to 85; she was in complete control. That hard work deserved a big, match-winning hundred,” Chopra said on JioStar.Chopra added that Deepti may have been trying too hard under pressure.“We spoke about it after the last match as well. She got 80 against Australia and missed a hundred. Perhaps it’s the pressure of chasing or the desire to finish quickly. The same goes for Deepti. Why play an aerial shot on the biggest boundary against Sophie Ecclestone when it’s not needed? You already have a boundary in the over and Amanjot at the other end. It was unnecessary. Maybe it’s just that extra effort players put on themselves under pressure,” she said.Despite her critique, Chopra also praised Deepti’s growth and contributions. ""There are a lot of positives. When the team looks back, they’ll see that Deepti, Smriti, and Harmanpreet all contributed significantly. Deepti, in particular, has impressed over the last 12 months. Not only with her batting and bowling, but also her growing understanding of the game.""""Yes, she couldn’t take India over the line, but the way she carried the innings after Harmanpreet’s dismissal, rotating strike, avoiding risky sweep shots, opening up the off-side field, was impressive. The one major area of concern was fielding. India probably gave away 20–30 extra runs, and if those had been saved, the chase could have been much easier,"" Chopra concluded.",Former India skipper Anjum Chopra criticises Deepti Sharma's approach.

Australian cricket legend Ian Healy has cautioned England about the crucial nature of the Perth Test in the upcoming Ashes series, predicting a potential 3-1 series loss if England fails to win the opening match at Perth starting November 21. England enters the series with minimal preparation, having only one three-day warm-up match scheduled at Lilac Hill Park from November 13-15.England has not won an Ashes series since 2015, with recent series in 2019 and 2023 ending in 2-2 draws. Their last Test victory in Australia dates back to 2011.""England will win a Test... (But) you will see how you look when you're underdone in Perth – I hope England watch it. It was swinging and bouncing. All the batsmen were playing outrageous shots and getting caught. England, watch out, you're doing the same thing,"" Healy said on SENQ Breakfast.Healy expressed concerns about England's preparation and their understanding of the Optus Stadium surface. ""They're coming in underdone, and our fast bowlers looked fresh and sharp last night (in the ODI against India). Are England going to win a Test? Yes, but I think it will be close, maybe 2-2.Perth is the most important Test. If England loses in Perth, they will lose 3-1. Win in Perth it's 2-2,"" he added.Healy also discussed his preference for the Australian batting lineup, suggesting Marnus Labuschagne as opener. Labuschagne, who faced challenges in recent years leading to his exclusion from the West Indies series, has shown promising form with four centuries in five innings across List A and Sheffield Shield matches for Queensland.""I'm very happy with Marnus' form, he's back. Marnus can open and he's happy to go wherever selectors want him. I've got him at 1 and Khawaja at 2.

New ODI Captain Shubman Gill speaks out on Virat, Rohit and taking Indian cricket forward

Poll Should Kuldeep Yadav have played in the ODI against Australia? Yes, he is a proven wicket-taker No, Washington Sundar was a better choice

Shubman Gill’s maiden outing as India’s ODI captain ended on a disappointing note, with the visitors succumbing to a seven-wicket defeat against Australia in a rain-hit encounter at Perth. The result exposed shortcomings in both departments, as India’s batting faltered and the bowlers failed to apply pressure. Team selection also raised eyebrows, with Kuldeep Yadav ’s exclusion proving costly. The management’s decision to prefer Washington Sundar for his batting depth over Kuldeep’s proven wicket-taking ability drew widespread scrutiny.Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif came down hard on the bowling unit, criticising the reliance on part-timers and pointing out that victories cannot always hinge on Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammad Shami. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Kaif labelled Nitish Kumar Reddy “not a complete bowler” and felt the rest of the attack lacked bite on a surface offering help.“In this team, there were too many part-time options. Nitish Reddy is not a complete bowler, and even Sundar struggled to make an impact on this pitch. Harshit Rana would be disappointed too. The bowlers had a chance to turn the game around, even with a low total.But when will they take that responsibility? You can’t expect to win only when Bumrah or Shami are playing,” Kaif remarked.India were restricted to 136 for 9 in 26 overs amid multiple rain interruptions. The DLS adjustment handed Australia a revised target of 131, which they comfortably chased in 21.1 overs. For India, Arshdeep Singh, Axar Patel, and Washington Sundar picked up a wicket apiece, while KL Rahul (38), Axar Patel (31), and Nitish Reddy (19*) provided brief resistance with the bat.Kaif also took aim at Gill’s leadership, questioning the tactical decision to bench Kuldeep Yadav. He drew parallels with Shane Warne’s success in Australian conditions, stressing that match-winning bowlers make the real difference.“It was a test of Gill as captain too. He didn’t pick Kuldeep, a genuine wicket-taker. You tried to cover every base but missed the key element. Shane Warne thrived in Australia across formats. I was disappointed Kuldeep didn’t play. Kuhnemann got two wickets, and by leaving Kuldeep out, India chose quantity over quality,” Kaif said.","Shubman Gill's maiden outing as India's ODI captain ended on a disappointing note, with the visitors succumbing to a seven-wicket defeat against Australia.

Poll What do you think of Mitchell Starc's bowling performance in the first ODI? Outstanding - He was the star of the match Good, but not the best Average, nothing special Disappointing - Expected more from him

In the first ODI between Australia and India, Mitchell Starc set up Virat Kohli beautifully and dismissed him for an eight-ball duck, but that wasn’t the highlight of his spell. Instead, it was a delivery to Rohit Sharma that took the internet by storm — Starc’s very first ball to the Indian skipper was clocked at a staggering 176.5 kmph, possibly the fastest ever recorded in ODI history.The speed gun graphic displayed a staggering 176.5 kph (109 mph), but it was clearly an error. Thankfully, other broadcasters’ graphics later confirmed the actual speed to be 140.8 kph (just over 87 mph) — right around Starc’s usual pace.Indian veterans Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma were on the receiving end after their underwhelming show in the first ODI of the three-match series against Australia. The duo walked out to bat in Perth after seven months.The veterans, who returned to international cricket for the first time since India’s victory at the Champions Trophy earlier this March, gave plenty of reasons for fans and experts to feel disappointed with their rough show.Opening the innings after being put to bat first, Rohit scored only eight runs off 14 balls before Josh Hazlewood dismissed him. After the former Indian captain’s disappointing innings, all eyes were on Kohli, as fans hoped he would help India recover after an early loss.However, Kohli also failed to deliver and was dismissed cheaply for an eight-ball duck. It was the first time Kohli had ever been dismissed for no score in ODI cricket in Australia.“Never easy when you lose three wickets in the powerplay, you’re always trying to play catch-up. There were a lot of learnings and positives as well,” said Gill after the match.This was India’s first defeat in ODIs in 2025, bringing their run of eight successive wins to an end.",Mitchell Starc's first ball to Rohit Sharma was clocked at a staggering 176.5 kmph.

Al-Nassr FC have confirmed that their captain, Cristiano Ronaldo , will not be part of the travelling squad that will arrive in India later tonight.

Goa police too had officially sought a status report on the Portugal superstar’s arrival.“Al-Nassr have informed FC Goa today that Ronaldo will not travel,” a source who has been tracking the development told TOI on Monday. “Even when FC Goa sought confirmation yesterday, they were asked to wait till today. The club is expected to make an official statement now.”Coach Jorge Jesus and the management believes it’s important to manage Ronaldo’s game time, particularly since the star is now 40 and keen to take part in next year’s FIFA World Cup 2026, which will be his record sixth appearance at the biggest sporting event on earth.Lothar Matthaus, Antonio Carbajal, Rafa Marquez, Gianluigi Buffon, Andres Guardado, Guillermo Ochoa and Lionel Messi are the others in the elite club of players with appearances at five different World Cups.Even without Ronaldo, Al-Nassr have done well in the AFC Champions League Two, winning both their games.

Liverpool faced their fourth consecutive defeat, a first in 11 years, as Manchester United secured a 2-1 victory at Anfield on Sunday.

India's men's senior national football team has dropped to 136th place in the latest FIFA World Rankings, marking their lowest position since November 2016.The team's new ranking coincides with their elimination from both the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifications.India's football journey has seen significant changes in recent times. After achieving success in the 2023 Intercontinental Cup, SAFF Championship, and Tri-Nation Series, the team's performance has declined considerably.Their promising period, which had helped them reach the top 100 rankings, was followed by a disappointing AFC Asian Cup campaign in Qatar. The team failed to score any goals and suffered three consecutive defeats in the group stage.The national team's leadership has undergone multiple changes, with three different head coaches in less than two years. Igor Štimac was replaced by Manolo Márquez, who was later succeeded by Khalid Jamil.Under Jamil's leadership, the team showed some tactical improvements during the CAFA Nations Cup friendly tournament. However, their competitive match results have remained unsatisfactory.The team's most recent competitive victory was against Kuwait in November 2023, with a score of 1-0.In the global rankings, Spain maintains its position at the top, followed by Argentina and France in second and third places respectively. The top eight positions are completed by England, Portugal, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Belgium.Germany has moved up two positions to 10th place after winning their qualifying matches against Luxembourg and Northern Ireland. Croatia has moved down to 11th position following their draw with the Czech Republic.The rankings will play a crucial role in determining the seedings for the expanded 48-team 2026 World Cup draw scheduled for December 5. The United States, Canada, and Mexico, as co-hosts, will be placed in the top-seed pot along with the nine highest-ranked direct qualifiers, likely including Germany.","India's men's senior national football team has dropped to 136th place in the latest FIFA World Rankings.

British officials are under mounting pressure to reverse a decision that prevents Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters from attending a European match at Aston Villa.

Juergen Klinsmann enjoys a rare distinction of being part of Der Klassiker both as a player and a coach. He is one of the four managers to have played for Bayern Munich and coached the Bavarian elites. Croatian Niko Kovac, the current Borussia Dortmund coach plotting to disrupt Bayern Munich’s all-win record this season on Saturday, is also part of the unique club.Talking to TOI on Wednesday, an excited Klinsmann expressed his thoughts on the upcoming fixture, considered to be the biggest draw in the Bundesliga. With Dortmund’s Serhou Guirassy cleared to play, the German goal-scoring legend feels that his eyes will sway between the Guinean striker and Bayern’s in-form Harry Kane “Well, I think these are the games that, as a striker, you wait for the whole year. You badly want to score in these matchups. So, obviously it doesn’t need extra motivation for any of the players when these two teams clash because it’s a big deal in Germany and for all the Bundesliga fans around the world.”Klinsmann obviously loves talking about strikers. “Kane, Guirassy, (Michael) Olise, (Karim) Adeyemi, all, I’m sure, wait for such evenings.Days before, you kind of think through it and you wish you want to score. Immediately television and social media will showcase the moment around the world and that’s pretty cool.”Scoring seems to come as naturally as breathing for Harry Kane, the English captain in Bayern’s forward lineup. He has already scored 21 goals for club and country. Guirassy, too, has 10 to his credit across all competitions.“I think games like that, you want to have somebody to stand out. You want to have somebody to put the stamp on the match. And when you have players of this calibre, then all us football fans want to wait for these moments. We want to see them kind of prove a point,” said the German goal-scoring legend.Klinsmann couldn’t help referring to his playing days but not in a glorifying nostalgic way. Accepting the evolution of the game, he said, “The video analysts and the coaching staff dissect your game so thoroughly that they know where the weaknesses of the opponents are, how to break them down. During my days, things weren’t that sophisticated. We were not so deeply prepared by video analysts about the opponents.”(Watch Bundesliga 2025-26 Bayern Munich vs. Borussia Dortmund on 18th October 2025 from 10 PM IST live on Sony Sports Ten 2 SD & HD.)","Juergen Klinsmann is one of the four managers to have played for Bayern Munich and coached the Bavarian elites.

Who is Emily Wilkinson - Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield's wife?

Building a life together, on and off the field



From NFL spotlight to family first

Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield has been making headlines again — not just for his performance on the field, but for how he’s bounced back in 2025 after years of ups and downs across the NFL . From being drafted first overall by the Cleveland Browns in 2018 to stints with the Panthers and now the Bucs, Mayfield’s career has been anything but predictable. Through it all, one thing hasn’t changed: his relationship with his wife, Emily Wilkinson. The couple, who recently welcomed a baby girl, Kova Jade Mayfield in 2024, have steadily become one of the NFL’s most talked-about pairs — not for drama or controversy, but for their consistency, connection, and how they’ve navigated fame together.Emily Wilkinson is more than just the woman standing next to Baker Mayfield at NFL events or family photos. She’s built her own following as a content creator, influencer, and entrepreneur — all while being a steady presence in Mayfield’s life through every city, contract, and headline. Born in 1991 in Nebraska, Emily stayed close to home for college, earning a business degree from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. She later moved to Los Angeles, where she worked in the medical field as a patient coordinator at a plastic surgery clinic.But everything changed when Baker entered the picture.After being introduced through a mutual friend in 2017, the two hit it off quickly. Emily was skeptical at first — unsure if Baker was just another flashy athlete. But after one lunch, she saw something different. Within days, Baker had moved in with her and her brothers in L.A. The rest, as they say, is history.When Baker got drafted by the Browns in 2018, Emily left California and moved to Cleveland to be with him. Since then, she’s been by his side through every team change, while also building a life of her own. Now, with more than 229,000 Instagram followers, she shares a mix of real-life moments — from being a mom and traveling to everyday routines and brand deals. Her posts feel natural and relatable, not overly polished, and that’s what fans seem to enjoy most. Whether she’s cheering for Baker at games or giving a peek into their home life, Emily has created her own space — always keeping family at the center.After years of injuries, trades, and questions about his future, Mayfield seems to have found new energy in Tampa Bay. And as he focuses on proving himself once again in the league, Emily continues to be his biggest cheerleader — not just on Instagram, but in life.Their love story may have started with a FaceTime call and some skepticism, but now, years later — with a baby in their arms, and a decade of memories between them — it’s clear they’re playing the long game.","Emily Wilkinson is the wife of Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield.

Did Caleb Williams Disrespect Troy Aikman?!

Caleb Williams and the Bears push back



ESPN broadcaster and Hall of Famer Troy Aikman found himself at the center of social media chatter following his critique of quarterback Caleb Williams during the Chicago Bears’ 25-24 win over the Washington Commanders on Monday Night Football. Aikman’s comments, particularly calling Williams’ 55-yard touchdown pass to D’Andre Swift “partly luck,” sparked a mix of reactions from fans and players alike. Despite the criticism, Aikman remains unfazed and confident in his analysis.Speaking on The Ticket in Dallas, Aikman admitted he was surprised by the backlash. “I’m still not real sure exactly what it’s all about, but it’s part of the job,” he said. He explained that live broadcasts can naturally produce commentary that may be interpreted in different ways, adding, “People are motivated for different reasons, so however it got initiated, I’m not real sure. But it’s not something that I really lose much sleep over. ”Aikman clarified that his critique did not come from a place of bias. “I’m a fan of [Williams]; I like the way he plays,” he said, highlighting his appreciation for Williams’ adaptability in a new offensive system and his willingness to learn from head coach Ben Johnson . While some fans speculated that Aikman’s criticism may have been harsher because he and Williams did not meet prior to the game, Aikman did not confirm any personal feelings influencing his broadcast.Williams and Johnson both voiced their reactions to the broadcast. Williams posted on Instagram referencing Aikman’s “lucky” comment as a playful jab, calling it a “little bit of fuel, a little bit of motivation.” Johnson, meanwhile, addressed the media, noting that some people weren’t impressed by the Bears’ victory, subtly referencing Aikman’s analysis. Williams finished the game with 252 passing yards, one touchdown, and a 98.6 passer rating, proving the effectiveness of his performance despite the criticism.Aikman acknowledged that live commentary is not always perfect, saying, “Over the years, you do a game on live television for three and a half hours, and there’s times when I’ve walked out of the stadium thinking, ‘man, could I have said that maybe a little bit differently?’ But Monday night wasn’t one of those.” His remarks reflect a seasoned analyst comfortable with scrutiny, focused on fair evaluation rather than public opinion.As the season continues, any future Bears games on ESPN may bring renewed attention to Aikman’s analysis of Caleb Williams. For now, Aikman appears undeterred, standing by his commentary while respecting the young quarterback’s talent and growth.Also Read: What’s wrong with Sam LaPorta?

Vikings defend Isaiah Rodgers amid racist messages



Isaiah Rodgers responds with dignity and resolve



The Minnesota Vikings have expressed outrage after cornerback Isaiah Rodgers became the target of racial slurs following Sunday’s 28-22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. The team issued a powerful statement condemning the abuse, saying they were “disgusted” by the racist messages directed at their player. Rodgers, who had a tough outing on the field, found himself dealing with something far more painful off it.On Monday, Rodgers shared screenshots on Instagram showing hateful messages, including one using the N-word and another comparing him to Hitler. The latter sender later issued an apology. The 27-year-old cornerback also took to X (formerly Twitter) to speak about the incident, writing, “Racism is real. Keep football, football. That’s not even the worst I’ve seen.” He later added that these were “some of the most racist comments I have seen or read since I entered the league. ”The Vikings responded firmly, posting on social media: “We are disgusted by the racial slurs directed at Isaiah Rodgers following yesterday’s game. There is no room for racist words or actions in sports or society. We support Isaiah and all players who, unfortunately, experience this type of ignorant and prejudicial behavior far too often.”Rodgers’ teammates and fans have since rallied behind him, emphasizing the importance of respect and accountability in sports.Despite allowing key plays, including a 45-yard completion to A.J. Brown that sealed the Eagles’ win, Rodgers took full accountability for his performance. “I put it on me,” he admitted, showing the same professionalism that earned him recognition earlier this season. In Week 3, Rodgers made NFL history by becoming the first player ever to record two defensive touchdowns and two forced fumbles in a single game.After a strong start to the season and a recent $11 million deal with Minnesota, this incident has shed light on the uglier side of online fan culture. Rodgers’ resilience and the Vikings’ strong stance send a clear message — that racism has no place in football, and solidarity will always speak louder than hate.The Vikings (3-3) now look to regroup as they face the Los Angeles Chargers next, but the conversation around respect and equality remains far bigger than any scoreboard.Also Read: Dan Campbell’s wife Holly steals spotlight in referee-inspired outfit during Lions’ MNF clash against Buccaneers","Minnesota Vikings cornerback Isaiah Rodgers was the target of racial slurs following Sunday's 28-22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.

Is Sam LaPorta hiding an injury? Lions star’s unexpected struggles in Week 7 raise big questions



Lions need LaPorta back in rhythm



The Detroit Lions entered Week 7 hungry for redemption after a crushing 30-17 defeat to the Kansas City Chiefs. From the opening whistle, it looked like they had learned their lesson. The offense came alive, the defense tightened up, and the energy was unmistakable. By halftime, Detroit held a commanding 14-3 lead, piling up 275 total yards while suffocating Tampa Bay’s offense under 100. Yet amid the Lions’ impressive resurgence, one name was unexpectedly quiet — Sam LaPorta.Since being drafted in the second round of 2023, Sam LaPorta has quickly become one of the most exciting tight ends in the NFL . His consistency, athleticism, and clutch performances have helped the Lions’ offense evolve into one of the most balanced units in football. Heading into the game, he was ranked second on PFSN’s TE Impact index, a reflection of just how vital he’s been to Detroit’s success this season.But against the Buccaneers, LaPorta’s first half was a surprising departure from his usual form. The tight end didn’t record a single reception through two quarters — a rare sight for someone often at the heart of the Lions’ offensive rhythm. Whether it was Tampa Bay’s coverage schemes or Detroit’s focus on spreading the ball around, LaPorta was practically invisible on the stat sheet.While the Lions appeared comfortable heading into the second half, getting LaPorta back into sync could be crucial moving forward. He’s been Jared Goff’s security blanket in key moments, particularly on third downs and red-zone plays. A player of his caliber thrives on rhythm, and the longer he goes without touches, the more it affects the team’s offensive flow.Detroit’s Week 7 matchup might end as a statement win for the team, but LaPorta’s slow start is a storyline to watch closely. For a franchise looking to prove it belongs among the NFL’s elite, keeping its star tight end involved isn’t just a preference — it’s a necessity.Also Read: Dan Campbell’s wife Holly steals spotlight in referee-inspired outfit during Lions’ MNF clash against Buccaneers","Sam LaPorta didn’t record a single reception through two quarters against Tampa Bay.

After a tough 30-17 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, the Detroit Lions are determined to bounce back strong as they host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Monday Night Football. The matchup promises intensity on the field, but before kickoff, it was Dan Campbell’s wife, Holly Campbell, who drew attention with her unique game-day look and heartfelt show of support.Before Monday’s matchup at Ford Field, Holly Campbell made waves when she walked onto the field to wish her husband luck, dressed in a bold black-and-white sweater paired with leather shorts and boots — a look fans compared to a referee’s uniform. She shared glimpses of the outfit on her Instagram Stories, which quickly caught the attention of Lions fans online.Holly, who has been married to Dan since 1999 and is mom to their two children, Cody and Piper, is a familiar face at Lions games. She rarely misses a match, traveling both home and away to cheer for her husband’s team. Yet, she admits the stress of watching can sometimes be overwhelming. “If things are not going our way, I get sent to the bathroom,” she once told People. “It's like a break. I can just, you know, sit on the toilet and watch the gamecast on ESPN and just wait for the cheers so I can come out. ”While much of the focus is on the Lions’ comeback efforts, Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles had nothing but admiration for his counterpart.“Dan is very tough but he's very smart,” Bowles told reporters. “He's very smart. He's very tough. He's always going to be disciplined and well coached. It's going to be a battle.”Bowles’ words set the tone for what could be one of the most hard-fought games of the week. Dan Campbell, known for his grit and emotional leadership, has been a symbol of the Lions’ resurgence. His passion has not only inspired his players but also his biggest supporter — his wife, Holly.As she continues to stand by Dan through the highs and lows, Holly’s style — and superstitions — have become part of the Lions’ lore. And if the Lions manage to turn things around against Tampa Bay, her “referee look” might just become the team’s newest good-luck charm.Also Read: “Blake definitely won’t be among the guests”: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's massive wedding guest list includes everyone but former bestie","Detroit Lions coach Dan Campbell's wife Holly wore a referee-inspired outfit before Monday's game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Travis Kelce Shares His First Reaction About Taylor Swift Engagement Ring Before NFL Game

Blake Lively’s absence sparks speculation amid cooling friendship



Taylor Swift is going all out for her upcoming wedding to NFL star Travis Kelce but she’s also being strategic. The pop megastar is reportedly planning one of the biggest celebrity celebrations of the decade, complete with an extensive guest list meant to silence speculation about feuds and fractured friendships. Yet, insiders say one familiar name won’t make the cut, actress Blake Lively.According to insiders close to the couple, Swift is determined to keep her wedding “drama-free.” After years of tabloid chatter about celebrity rivalries, the singer is reportedly inviting “almost everyone she knows” to prevent gossip about who was or wasn’t included. “Taylor wants this wedding to be completely drama-free,” a source told RadarOnline. “She’s aware that people will look at the guest list for signs of tension or old grudges. So she’s decided to invite broadly — everyone from past collaborators to industry friends.”Appearing on The Graham Norton Show last week, Swift confirmed that her wedding will be a destination affair but said the date is still undecided. “I’m just doing the album thing now, which is a big thing,” she explained. “And then I think the wedding is what happens after that in the scheme of the planning, but I’m so excited about it.”The singer added, “I know it’s going to be fun to plan because I think the only stressful wedding is when you have a small amount of space for guests. That’s when you have to assess your relationship to see if they’re going to be there. Everyone in my bubble will be invited.”Despite Swift’s open invitation policy, insiders confirmed that Blake Lively “definitely won’t” be among the guests. Once close friends, often seen together on double dates and family holidays, their bond reportedly cooled earlier this year due to “different life priorities” and “creative disagreements.”As for the wedding itself, fans can expect nothing short of spectacular. Swift revealed that Kelce’s proposal was a carefully orchestrated surprise: “He really crushed it when it came to surprising me. He had the garden at his house covered in flowers and even built a hedge wall so my tour photographer could hide inside.”With her album The Life of a Showgirl still dominating charts and her Eras Tour nearing its grand finale, Swift’s next chapter, a fairytale wedding with Kelce, promises to be her biggest celebration yet.Also Read: Travis Kelce’s retirement plans take a turn despite wedding buzz with Taylor Swift","Taylor Swift plans to invite “everyone in her bubble” to avoid feud rumors.

What happened to Tyler Lockett? Why did the Titans cut ties with the veteran receiver just seven games into the season?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/what-happened-to-tyler-lockett-why-did-the-titans-cut-ties-with-the-veteran-receiver-just-seven-games-into-the-season/articleshow/124711318.cms,"Veteran wide receiver Tyler Lockett has been released by the Tennessee Titans just seven games into his tenure, a move he requested. Struggling with a sluggish offense, the 31-year-old recorded only 10 catches for 70 yards. Now a free agent, Lockett is expected to draw interest from several teams facing receiver shortages, potentially revitalizing his career.

A rough season and a disappointing start for Tyler Lockett in Tennessee

What’s next for Tyler Lockett as multiple teams look for receiver help



In a surprising midseason shake-up, the Tennessee Titans have released veteran wide receiver Tyler Lockett, just seven games into his first year with the team. The move came at Lockett’s own request, as confirmed by ESPN’s Adam Schefter, and it opens the door for the former Seattle Seahawks star to sign with another franchise as soon as Wednesday at 4 p.m. ET.Lockett’s time in Tennessee never found its rhythm. Despite joining the Titans with the reputation of being one of the NFL’s most reliable and explosive wideouts, the 31-year-old veteran struggled to make an impact in the team’s sluggish 1-6 start. Through seven games, he managed just 10 receptions for 70 yards, a far cry from the production fans had grown accustomed to during his decade-long run in Seattle.The Titans’ offense has battled inconsistency and injuries all season, leaving players like Lockett unable to shine. For a player who has recorded over 1,000 receiving yards in multiple seasons and built a strong connection with Russell Wilson during his Seahawks years, this quiet start was both uncharacteristic and frustrating. His release signals not only his own desire for a fresh start but also Tennessee’s acknowledgment that the partnership simply wasn’t working.With several NFL teams facing receiver shortages due to injuries, Lockett’s availability could spark immediate interest.Potential landing spots being discussed include the Las Vegas Raiders, Pittsburgh Steelers, New York Jets, and San Francisco 49ers, all teams in need of a veteran pass-catcher who can contribute both on the field and in the locker room.For now, Lockett remains quiet about his next move, but fans and analysts alike will be watching closely to see where he lands. After a decade of being one of the league’s most respected receivers, this new chapter could either rejuvenate his career or mark the beginning of its final stretch. One thing’s for sure, Tyler Lockett isn’t ready to fade quietly from the NFL spotlight.Also Read: Travis Kelce’s retirement plans take a turn despite wedding buzz with Taylor Swift","The Tennessee Titans have released veteran wide receiver Tyler Lockett.

A recent revelation about his dream of playing in Madrid, specifically at the iconic Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, has fueled speculation. The upcoming NFL game in Spain has ignited his desire for a historic European appearance, potentially delaying his departure from the game.

A dream beyond Kansas City: Travis Kelce’s Madrid revelation



Travis Kelce Shares His First Reaction About Taylor Swift Engagement Ring Before NFL Game

Chiefs’ resurgence and Travis Kelce’s renewed energy

Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce might not be hanging up his cleats just yet. Despite earlier statements suggesting the 2025 NFL season would mark the end of his illustrious 13-year career, the veteran tight end appears to be reconsidering his timeline and it’s all because of one lifelong dream he’s not ready to give up.When asked recently if he’d like to play in Madrid, Kelce’s eyes lit up with genuine excitement. His response instantly fueled speculation about his retirement plans. “Are you kidding me? I'll be dreaming about that until we make it happen. I'd love that, man. Everyone... I just hope the NFL keeps expanding, and in Spain, I hope we can play a game there. It would be incredible.”The upcoming matchup between the Miami Dolphins and Washington Commanders at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on November 16, the NFL’s first-ever game in Spain, appears to have struck a chord with Kelce. When pressed further about whether he’d want to take the field in that historic venue, Kelce didn’t hesitate to respond, “I hope so. Yeah, baby.”The Chiefs have regained their rhythm after a shaky start, looking once again like Super Bowl contenders. Patrick Mahomes is back in MVP form, and the team’s core is finally healthy. That winning energy may also be fueling Kelce’s desire to extend his career.Off the field, Kelce’s life is busier than ever, between his thriving business ventures and his highly publicized engagement to Taylor Swift , who is set to marry him next year. Still, for a player as passionate and competitive as Kelce, the chance to add one final, iconic moment to his career — playing in Europe’s most famous soccer stadium, might be too irresistible to walk away from.For now, his future remains open-ended. But one thing is clear: if the NFL gives Travis Kelce a shot at playing under the lights of the Bernabéu, retirement may just have to wait.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes’ reaction to Patrick Mahomes’ Taylor Swift tribute steals spotlight after Chiefs’ win","Travis Kelce is reportedly reconsidering his planned 2025 retirement.

“Just a terrible person”: Bad Bunny’s all-Spanish Super Bowl halftime show reignites decades of anti-Latin bias in America,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/just-a-terrible-person-bad-bunnys-all-spanish-super-bowl-halftime-show-reignites-decades-of-anti-latin-bias-in-america/articleshow/124704604.cms,"Bad Bunny headlining the 2026 Super Bowl Halftime Show, a historic first sung in Spanish, has ignited a backlash from conservatives. Critics, including Donald Trump, have called for boycotts, overlooking that Bad Bunny is an American citizen. This resistance echoes past struggles for Latin representation in entertainment, highlighting ongoing prejudice despite progress.

Conservatives call for boycotts and “All-American” countershows

A repeated pattern of resistance toward Latin representation

When the NFL announced that global superstar Bad Bunny would headline the 2026 Super Bowl Halftime Show, the decision was celebrated across much of the world. Fans saw it as a groundbreaking moment, the first Super Bowl performance sung entirely in Spanish, representing millions of bilingual and Latino Americans. But while the announcement marked a historic cultural milestone, it also exposed the deep-rooted xenophobia that still lingers in U.S. entertainment and politics.Almost instantly after the reveal, right-wing media figures and politicians launched into outrage. Newsmax host Greg Kelly went as far as calling for a national boycott, claiming Bad Bunny “hates America, hates President Trump, hates ICE, hates the English language! He’s just a terrible person.” President Donald Trump also chimed in, saying, “I never heard of him. I don’t know who he is. I don’t know why they’re doing it… I think it’s absolutely ridiculous. ”Even Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stirred controversy by suggesting immigration agents would be “all over” the event, a veiled threat that sparked widespread condemnation.Conservative youth group Turning Point USA announced plans for a “counterprogram,” branding it “The All-American Halftime Show” that would feature “faith, family, and freedom.”Ironically, many of these critics overlooked one simple fact: Bad Bunny is an American citizen, born in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory.The backlash mirrors historic patterns of resistance whenever Latin artists gain national visibility. In 1968, José Feliciano was vilified for performing a soulful, acoustic version of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” even receiving hate mail and calls for deportation, despite being Puerto Rican and legally American. Similarly, at the 1999 Grammys, producers initially resisted having Ricky Martin open the show with “The Cup of Life,” claiming a Spanish-language act wouldn’t connect with audiences.Fast forward to today, and Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl moment symbolizes both progress and persistence, progress in representation, and persistence of prejudice. By performing in Spanish, he isn’t just putting on a concert; he’s challenging decades of cultural gatekeeping.For millions of Latinos, his show will be more than halftime entertainment, it will be an act of visibility, pride, and defiance. In the language he was born into, Bad Bunny is about to make one of the most unapologetically American statements ever seen on the world’s biggest stage.Also Read: “F***ing high and crazy”: Cardi B slams Donald Trump’s $186B food aid cuts while expecting fourth child with Stefon Diggs","Bad Bunny will headline the 2026 Super Bowl Halftime Show in Spanish.

After Swift dropped her twelfth studio album, The Life of a Showgirl, fans have started blending pop culture with football pride in a way that’s both hilarious and heartwarming.During a recent Kansas City Chiefs game at Arrowhead, one fan caught everyone’s attention with a customized jersey that swapped Travis Kelce ’s name for a bold new nickname, “Redwood.” The cheeky design pays homage to Swift’s ninth track, “Wood,” which is widely believed to be inspired by her relationship with Kelce.In the song, Swift sings, “redwood tree,” a lyric that’s become a playful reference point for fans.

All you need to know about Anthony Edwards’ tense custody dispute with ex Ayesha Howard

Since the Minnesota Timberwolves selected Anthony Edwards first overall in the 2020 NBA Draft, he has become a household name.

Throughout his career, Edwards, who was born in Atlanta, Georgia. has been inspired by his family. He has a close relationship with his family members as well.

The people I came in with is the people I’m gonna stay with. I’m not adding no other people to my circle”.The Timberwolves star has rarely held back from praising his family, referring to his sister as the mainstay and his siblings and himself as sheets of paper. He started playing basketball because of his family. By the ninth grade, he was being coached by Justin Holland, a basketball trainer from Atlanta who was instrumental in helping him develop his abilities.However, Edwards never delved too deep into his background. He once stated that his mother and grandmother, Shirley, raised him most of the time, but they both tragically passed away when Anthony was 14 years old, leaving his older brother and sister to raise him.He was heavily influenced by his family throughout his early years, especially his grandmother, who played with him at her home, and his father, who gave him the nickname ""Ant-Man"" when he was three years old.In a November 2020 ESPN profile, Anthony said that trust was hard for him following the deaths of his mother and grandmother.

He wrote, ""Future McDonald's All-American"" and ""Future NBA player"" in his shared bedroom. Shirley was first furious upon learning of it, but her anger soon subsided as she blessed him and hoped that all his wishes came true.A recent legal dispute between Anthony Edwards and his ex-girlfriend Ayesha Howard garnered media attention. The ongoing legal battle between the singer and the NBA star began when she demanded a sizable payment and a public apology.The dispute was related to the custody of their child, Aubri, according to Us Weekly. Edwards' ex-partner responded to what she called ""lies"" and ""fake news,” after rumours circulated that the Timberwolves player wanted to pay more than $1 million upfront for 18 years of child support for their daughter.Last October, Howard gave birth to their daughter.

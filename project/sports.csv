Poll Should India continue to experiment with Sanju Samson in the middle order? Yes, he needs more chances No, he should be at the top It's risky to change batting order

Sunil has been driving a taxi in Dubai for the past 18 years and vividly recalls two occasions when he had the chance to drop Sanju Samson — who hails from his own village, Vizhinjam, a coastal town near Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala — to the airport.There is a glint in his eyes when he talks about Sanju. ""Call it destiny or anything. I have dropped him twice at the Dubai airport. One time, he was alone, the other time he was with his brother (Sally). What a boy. A true gentleman,"" he shares.In two of the four matches India have played in the ongoing Asia Cup, the loudest cheer any batter has received while walking out to bat has been for Sanju Samson.At 30, Sanju Samson has been asked to do something he has never done in his T20 career. He has been a top-order batter for his Indian Premier League ( IPL ) franchise Rajasthan Royals and for India. He has either batted as an opener or at No. 3.In this Asia Cup, he has been given an unfamiliar role.Sanju Samson scored a scratchy 45-ball 56 on a sluggish Abu Dhabi pitch against Oman and looked completely out of sorts during his 17-ball stay against Pakistan in Dubai. He struggles when the ball gets soft, and with Jitesh Sharma waiting in the wings, having done extremely well for the IPL 2025 winner Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) at 5 and 6, it will be interesting to see how long India persist with Sanju Samson.Sanju Samson’s numbers as a non-opener for India don’t add up well. In 23 matches, he has scored only 408 runs, with an average of 20.40 and a strike rate of 121.8. Bangladesh would be looking to target him with spin in the middle overs when they square off on Wednesday (September 24).India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate feels Sanju is still ""figuring out"" how to play that role in the middle order.""There's two outings now, two decent chances, and he's still figuring out how to play that role,"" ten Doeschate said.""I think the wicket was a little bit tired in the Pakistan game. But certainly, with the way Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma are going at the top, and with your captain ( Suryakumar Yadav ) batting at three and the way Tilak (Verma) has played, we're really looking for a No. 5. So we believe Sanju is the best man for that job and we’ve got no doubt he’ll figure out how to play that role in the future.""However, there is no question over Sanju’s place in the playing XI. Head coach Gautam Gambhir has famously told him that he wouldn’t drop him from the team even if he scored ""21 ducks."" Gambhir wasn’t the only one to back him. Samson revealed that Suryakumar Yadav, during the Duleep Trophy in 2024, promised him a stretch of seven matches as an opener.But with Shubman Gill’s elevation as T20I vice-captain, Sanju, who has done extremely well at the top with Abhishek Sharma, lost his spot and is currently floating in the middle order.After the six-wicket win over Pakistan, captain Suryakumar Yadav made it clear that barring the two openers, India will go with a flexible middle order.""I think everyone should be flexible in batting except for the openers. Because we have left-handers, right-handers, power-hitters, and some players who can play the game well. So it's very important to be flexible,"" he explained.""So irrespective of the need of the hour, if someone has scored 50 at No. 3 or No. 4, and there is a requirement to bat at No. 5 or 6 in the next game, then the batsmen have accepted that we will bat like that.""And this is how the team will run. Because in this format, I feel that if players create impact and score small but important runs, then I feel it will be a very dangerous team.""On Wednesday against Bangladesh -- against whom Sanju cracked a 40-ball hundred last year in Hyderabad, will have another chance to cement his place in an unfamiliar role in that ""flexible"" middle order.","India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate feels Sanju Samson is still ""figuring out"" how to play that role in the middle order. In 23 matches, he has scored only 408 runs, with an average of 20.40 and a strike rate of 121.8.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124081761,imgsize-397734,width-400,resizemode-4/sanju-samson.jpg"

Poll Do you think Bangladesh can defeat India in the upcoming match? Yes, they have a good chance! No, India will win easily.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh head coach Phil Simmons has sent a strong message ahead of Wednesday’s Asia Cup Super Fours showdown against reigning world champions India, insisting that no team, including his ‘Tigers’, should be intimidated by the star-studded opposition.“Every team has the ability to beat India,” said Simmons, who played for the West Indies in the late 1980s and ’90s. “The game is played on the day. It's not what India has done before. It's what happens on Wednesday. It's what happens during that three and a half hour period. We will try to play as best as we can and hope to find chinks in India's armoury. That's the way we win games.”Bangladesh enter the clash on the back of a morale-boosting victory over Sri Lanka in their first Super Fours match, a rare highlight in a format where they have historically struggled. Simmons wants his team to soak in the electric atmosphere at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, remain focused, and enjoy the challenge.“Every game, especially games involving India, have a hype because they're the number one T20 team in the world.There must be a hype. We're just going to ride on the hype. We're going to enjoy the moment and enjoy the game,” he said.Assessing conditions, Simmons described the Dubai track as excellent for batting, downplaying the impact of the toss. “I didn't see much of a difference in the wicket over the 40 overs. The wicket was really good to bat. Bowlers had to bowl properly. I don't think the toss has that much of an effect,” he said.Acknowledging the challenges of back-to-back T20 games in the September heat, Simmons praised his squad’s preparation. “It is extremely difficult to play back-to-back T20 matches, back-to-back ODIs. But again we are prepared, we have trained really hard. I think the guys are fit enough to handle it,” he added.On strategy, Simmons emphasised consistency over risk-taking in T20 cricket. “Since I've been here, we've tried to make sure that this is the way we want to play. And we've picked the correct players to play that way. And so far, it's benefitted us.”Even amidst intense scrutiny and criticism from passionate Bangladeshi fans, Simmons remains unshaken. “As long as I'm confident and my staff and myself, including the captain, are confident in what we're doing, then criticism is like water off a duck's back,” he concluded.",Bangladesh take on India in the Asia Cup Super Fours on Wednesday. Head coach Phil Simmons says no team can be intimidated by the world champions. Simmons says Bangladesh will try to find chinks in India's armoury.

Poll Will the final be an India vs Pakistan showdown? Yes No

NEW DELHI: The Asia Cup 2025 has reached its business end with only four matches left, including Sunday's grand finale, and the race to the final remains wide open.After India and Bangladesh opened their Super Fours campaign with victories, Pakistan revived their hopes with a gritty five-wicket win over Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday. The result has kept alive the tantalising prospect of yet another India vs Pakistan showdown — in the tournament final.For both Pakistan and Sri Lanka, who had lost their opening Super Four fixtures, Tuesday's clash was a do-or-die affair. Pakistan's bowlers set the tone by restricting Sri Lanka to 133/8 on a featherbed pitch. Despite a strong 45-run opening stand, the chase turned tense at 80/5 before Mohammad Nawaz (38* off 24) and Hussain Talat (32* off 30) stitched together a 58-run partnership to see their side home with 12 balls to spare.The win propelled Pakistan to second place in the Super Fours table, level on two points with India and Bangladesh but ahead of the latter on net run rate. India sit atop with +0.689, Pakistan follow with +0.226, and Bangladesh slip to third with +0.121. Sri Lanka, winless after two games, are staring at elimination.The equation now is clear: if India beat Bangladesh in Dubai on Wednesday, Sri Lanka will be knocked out and India will secure their place in the final.That scenario would leave Thursday's Pakistan vs Bangladesh clash as a virtual semi-final, with the winner joining India in the summit clash.On the other hand, if Bangladesh upset India, the Super Fours battle will remain wide open, keeping alive the mathematical chances for all four teams. Pakistan and India would still need wins in their respective final fixtures to confirm qualification, while Bangladesh would be in pole position on four points but not yet guaranteed.With the standings delicately poised, Pakistan's hard-fought victory has ensured that the possibility of a third India vs Pakistan clash in this Asia Cup — and a blockbuster final — is very much alive.",Asia Cup 2025 has reached its business end with only four matches left.

Still a Work in Progress

Bangladesh cricket has always had a strong spin option. From Mohammad Rafique to Shakib Al Hasan , the nation has relied on their left-arm spinners to script some of its finest wins. Yet, one department has remained largely vacant: wrist spin. For years, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) searched for a leg-spinner who could provide the breakthroughs modern white-ball cricket so desperately demands. That search eventually unearthed a promising name -- Rishad Hossain.Rishad’s journey began in 2017, when the BCB organised a nationwide “spinner hunt.” The aim was clear: to discover mystery spinners and wrist spinners hidden across the country’s cricketing landscape. From that initiative, a lanky teenager emerged. Just 16 or 17 at the time, and immediately caught attention with his potential. That boy was Rishad Hossain. Within a year, he was wearing national colours at the 2018 U19 World Cup, a sign of the faith selectors placed in his raw, but exciting, talent.Following that early exposure, Rishad’s development was carefully nurtured.He trained with the High-Performance unit, played for Bangladesh A, and gradually eased into the professional domestic circuit through the Dhaka Premier League and the National Cricket League. His rise, however, wasn’t simply due to outstanding early performances.As his coach Sohel Islam candidly tells, “I think the board’s initiative was more prominent in his career than his own performance. In this modern white-ball era, getting breakthroughs in the middle overs is very important. For this, ODI teams use mystery spinners or wrist spinners. Keeping that in mind, the initiatives were taken.”Indeed, Rishad wasn’t an instant sensation.In his early days, he looked like just another young bowler with limited impact. But what separated him from the rest was his determination. He worked relentlessly on his craft, gradually transforming into a bowler Bangladesh could count on, particularly in T20 cricket. “In the initial part of this journey, he was a very ordinary bowler. But his work ethic, determination, and learning capacity helped him to become today’s Rishad Hossain,” Sohel says.Unlike many wrist spinners, Rishad isn’t known for extravagant turn. His strength lies elsewhere -- height, bounce, and control. His stock delivery, the traditional leg-spin, is his signature. But because he doesn’t get huge turn, he focuses on dip and topspin, extracting bounce from even flat surfaces. “As Rishad has the height, and he is not a big turner of the ball, that’s why he tries to dip the ball, and has the tendency to topspin in his body pattern,” Sohel explains.That doesn’t mean he lacks variation. Over the years, he has added the wrong’un or googly, which he can bowl to both right and left-handers quite effectively. His challenge now is to increase the effectiveness of those variations by improving angles and disguises. But for now, his biggest strength remains landing his stock ball consistently in good areas.Behind Rishad’s progress lies a training philosophy built on fundamentals. “The method is very simple — we drill the basics of leg-spin: proper wrist position, hip rotation, shoulder alignment, head position,” Sohel outlines. Every session begins with these fundamentals. Once they are intact, the focus shifts to nets, match scenarios, and opposition-specific strategies.In T20 cricket, this preparation becomes crucial. Every ball can change momentum. So, the discussions often revolve around tactical awareness: what to bowl after conceding a single, how to respond to a big shot, and what a particular batter is trying to do. For Rishad, developing game sense has been as important as perfecting his action.But being a leg-spinner in Bangladesh is not easy. The country’s pitches are notorious for being low and skiddy, not conducive for tall spinners who thrive on bounce. Rashid Khan , for instance, succeeds on such surfaces because of his fast, skiddy style. Rishad, however, bowls with more topspin, needing harder wickets for his deliveries to bite.That mismatch presented its own struggles in his formative years. He often performed better overseas—on bouncy tracks in Australia or Pakistan—than at home. “Getting that type of wicket in Bangladesh is very difficult. So, he had struggles in his upbringing stages, as his type of wicket is unavailable in Bangladesh,” Sohel says. Yet, those very challenges have toughened him and broadened his adaptability.Interestingly, Rishad doesn’t idolise any single bowler. He prefers learning from many. Conversations with his coach often touch on the success of leg-spinners like Adil Rashid or Yuzvendra Chahal in T20s. Rishad observes, analyses, and then asks, “What would you do in this situation?” That curiosity helps him sharpen his cricketing intelligence. “There are many players who have icons, but I didn’t notice any icon that he follows. Rather, he thinks by himself and tries to figure out how to become successful in different wickets of different countries as a leg spinner,” Sohel reflects.A newer dimension to Rishad’s journey has been franchise cricket. With Bangladeshi players historically getting limited overseas opportunities outside of Shakib Al Hasan, his entry into this world was both challenging and educational. Franchise cricket tested his adaptability, not just in terms of bowling on new pitches, but also in communicating with foreign teammates and coaches.Like any professional, his mindset has been simple: prove his importance to the team and contribute to victories. “There is only one mindset,” Sohel says, quoting Rishad, “‘As a professional player, while playing, I have to contribute to the team’s winning.’ There are no other options to think outside of it.”Today, Rishad is an important part of Bangladesh’s T20 setup. Yet, even his coach admits, “we still cannot fully trust him. He has many sectors to develop.”Before Rishad, there were Wahidul Gani and later Jubair Hossain. Part-time leg-spinner Alok Kapali created history with Bangladesh’s first Test hat-trick. Yet, leg-spin remained the craft of outliers in the country.For Bangladesh, Rishad represents more than just another bowler. He embodies years of investment, and hope that the nation could finally field a leg-spinner capable of changing matches in the middle overs. His story is still being written, but one thing is clear: from a teenager discovered in a nationwide hunt to a bowler growing on the international stage, Rishad Hossain is Bangladesh’s present and future.","Bangladesh cricket has always had a strong spin option.

NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has run out of patience with USA Cricket (USAC). On Tuesday afternoon, the ICC took the long-awaited call to suspend the USAC Board. The ICC got in a huddle earlier today after receiving several written complaints from various stakeholders in American cricket. The ICC released a detailed statement on the development and also explained the next steps.""The International Cricket Council (ICC), after a thorough review of affairs and extensive engagement with key stakeholders over the past year, today confirmed the suspension of ICC membership status of USA Cricket, with immediate effect. The decision, taken by the ICC Board during its meeting earlier, was based on USA Cricket’s repeated and continued breaches of its obligations as an ICC Member under the ICC’s Constitution.These include, but are not limited to, the failure to implement a functional governance structure, lack of progress toward achieving National Governing Body status with the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC), and significant actions that have caused reputational damage to cricket in the United States and around the world,"" read the statement.The writing had been on the wall for a while now ever since USAC was put on notice during the Annual Conference last year in Sri Lanka. At this year's conference in Singapore, the cricket body got three more months to set their house in order. For several weeks now, the ICC had repeatedly warned USAC and its Chairman Venu Pisike to put fair processes in place for transparent governance.Even in the third month of the notice extension, unresolved material conflicts, improper selection of candidates, and manipulation of processes to suit the needs of specific individuals remained the talking points ahead of the USAC elections.TimesofIndia.com has learned that three boards of Cricket Leagues—New Jersey, Dallas, and Southern California—have written to the members of the Nominations Governance Committee (NGC). The issues of validity of members in the ethics committee and the ""material conflict of interest"" were raised with the NGC, which also includes Jonathan Hall, General Counsel & Company Secretary at ICC.Even the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) had advocated for a complete revamp. In an email addressed to the USAC CEO Johnathan Atkeison, David Patterson, the Senior Governance Advisor at USOPC, proposed ""the Independent members of the USA Cricket Board of Directors resign"" and ""Independent members are appointed to replace those Independent members.""Both ICC and USOPC were on the same page when it came to pressing the reset button, and most of the current office bearers were also of the same opinion. Pisike, however, remained defiant and is reported to have even influenced other sitting office bearers to not resign from their position. The mess further deepened when the USAC decided to terminate its contract with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), the parent company of Major League Cricket (MLC).What next for USA Cricket?The ICC statement further explained that the global body will temporarily oversee the management and administration of national teams and also outline the next steps.""The management and administration of USA national teams will temporarily be overseen by the ICC and/or its designated representatives to ensure continued support for the players and maintain momentum towards Olympic inclusion. This approach reflects the ICC’s firm commitment to upholding the best interests of cricketers in the USA and the sustenance of a High-performance & Player development program which will seek to elevate the stature and capabilities of players representing the USA.""The ICC Normalisation Committee, supported by the ICC management, will outline the steps required for the suspension on USA Cricket to be lifted and its membership rights restored. These will include demonstrable and specific changes to USA Cricket’s governance structure, operations, and overall status in the Cricket ecosystem. The Normalisation Committee will also monitor USA Cricket’s progress and provide consultative support,"" added the statement.","The International Cricket Council (ICC) has run out of patience with USA Cricket (USAC) On Tuesday afternoon, the ICC took the long-awaited call to suspend the USAC Board.

Beware Pakistan! Abhishek Sharma hits massive sixes in the nets

Poll Which aspect of the India-Pakistan match do you find more intriguing? The cricketing skills displayed. The rivalry and tension. The social media reactions.

NEW DELHI: After shutting down arch-rivals Pakistan for the second time in eight days, India opener Abhishek Sharma made a bold statement off the field, posting a sly dig at their rivals on social media. Leading from the front, Sharma smashed a scintillating 74 off just 39 balls as India chased down 172 in 18.5 overs to secure a six-wicket Super Four victory at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.Accompanying his post were action shots from the match, highlighting his 105-run opening partnership with close friend and fellow opener Shubman Gill , who contributed 47 off 28 balls. The post simply read: “You talk, we win.”The message quickly went viral, reflecting not just the on-field dominance but the simmering tension that characterised the clash.The match itself was charged from the outset. Tempers flared when Gill and Pakistan pacer Shaheen Afridi exchanged intense glances after boundaries were dispatched over the field. Abhishek and Haris Rauf also engaged in fiery on-field exchanges, with umpires stepping in to cool down moments of friction.“Today was pretty simple. The way they were coming out to us without any reason, I did not like it at all,” Abhishek said after being named player of the match. “That’s why I went after them. I wanted to deliver for the team.”Despite India losing Gill to Faheem Ashraf and Abhishek himself to Abrar Ahmed after his whirlwind innings, Tilak Varma’s unbeaten 30 guided the team home. India’s fielding, however, was not flawless, with four catches dropped, allowing Pakistan to post 171/5, with Sahibzada Farhan scoring a 58.The win marks a significant psychological advantage for India, who have now defeated Pakistan twice in the ongoing Asia Cup . With political tensions still simmering, these encounters continue to draw attention far beyond cricket, as social media reactions—including Abhishek’s pointed post—underscore the intensity of the rivalry.",India beat Pakistan by six wickets in their Super Four match in Dubai.

Beware Pakistan! Abhishek Sharma hits massive sixes in the nets

Fire, fury, and fireworks

Pakistan cash in on India’s sloppy fielding

""The best mirror is an old friend,” is a classical line by famous English poet George Herbert.Those lines seemed to have been written for Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma when the duo were batting together against Pakistan in their Super 4s clash at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.Gill and Abhishek were matching each other shot-for-shot and put on 105-runs for the opening wicket.On the eve of yet another highly-anticipated India vs Pakistan clash, only three Indian cricketers turned up for the optional practice session. Shubman Gill and Abhishek were two of them. Gill was struggling for runs, and it was Abhishek who lent him the comforting arm . He bowled in tandem with the net bowlers for an hour to Shubman. He challenged him to play sweep shots, teased his inability to hit the reverse sweep, and requested Varun Chakravarthy to trouble Gill with his variations. A day later, the duo, who have batted together since their U-12 days in Punjab , were at their destructive best.Chasing a stiff target of 172, India’s chase got off to a fiery start as Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill smashed a 100-run stand in just 8.4 overs. If Abhishek was at his destructive best, it was Gill who showed why he is such a delight to the eyes. In an expected high-voltage clash, which became even more dramatic due to the events of the past weeks , the Pakistani seamers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf started to abuse them in Punjabi. Shaheen had a go at Abhishek after being smacked for a six off the first ball.Shaheen then hurled a few abuses at Shubman, who looked at Shaheen and pointed with his hand where the ball went. There was a shade of Aamer Sohail vs Venky Prasad from 1996 to it. Haris Rauf hurled abuses at Abhishek, who hammered him for two boundaries, and the umpires had to intervene to separate Rauf and Abhishek.Abhishek set the tone by pulling Shaheen Afridi for a six off the very first over, while Gill, who had worked tirelessly in the nets on the eve of the match, struck boundaries with authority off Saim Ayub's off-spin. Their aggression only grew, with Abhishek dispatching Abrar Ahmed for towering sixes and Gill unfurling a reverse sweep — a stroke his partner had teased him about less than 24 hours ago.Abhishek raced to a 25-ball fifty, surviving two dropped chances along the way, while Gill kept the tempo high with crisp drives and sweeps. The partnership was finally broken at 105 when Gill, after battling cramps, was bowled by Faheem Ashraf for a brisk 47 off 28.India’s openers had set the chase alight with their fearless strokeplay and fiery exchanges, leaving Pakistan searching for answers. Abhishek departed for a sizzling 39-ball 74.India did lose quick wickets - Gill and then Suryakumar Yadav in the space of four balls - but it was too late for Pakistan. India chased down the total in 18.5 overs with six wickets in hand.India’s fielding woes came to the fore as they spilled five chances, allowing Pakistan to post a competitive 171/5.Sahibzada Farhan, the biggest beneficiary, rode his luck to a breezy half-century after being dropped twice by Abhishek Sharma.Abhishek first misjudged a regulation chance at third man when Farhan was on zero. The opener made India pay with crisp strokeplay, taking on Jasprit Bumrah for two boundaries and carting Varun Chakravarthy for back-to-back fours. He even finished the powerplay with two more boundaries off Bumrah as Pakistan raced to 55/1 after six overs.Farhan’s second life came in Varun’s over when Abhishek, stationed at long-on, covered ground to his right and leapt full stretch but failed to hold on, palming the ball over the ropes for six. The right-hander didn’t look back, slamming Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel for towering sixes to bring up his fifty, and his celebration took you back to MS Dhoni's first hundred against Pakistan.At 91/1 in 10 overs, Pakistan looked in control before Shivam Dube’s golden arm turned things around. He broke the 72-run stand by deceiving Saim Ayub with a slower one; this time Abhishek made amends with a diving catch running in from deep square. Dube then accounted for Farhan with another slower ball, Surya Yadav holding his nerve despite the batter’s bat flying out of his hands mid-shot.Kuldeep tightened the screws as Pakistan endured 21 balls without a boundary. Hussain Talat fell cheaply before skipper Salman Ali Agha ended the boundary drought, which lasted for 37 balls, with a six off the first ball of the 17th over. Dube’s fine spell, however, was blemished when Nawaz plundered 17 runs. Nawaz was then found napping as he didn’t plant his bat in the crease and Surya’s direct hit connected on the bounce.Fielding lapses continued to haunt India. Shubman Gill spilled a sitter at deep mid-wicket, giving Faheem Ashraf a reprieve. Bumrah endured a rare off day, finishing wicketless for 45 runs in his four overs. Pakistan eventually closed at 171/5, aided by India’s butterfingers as Faheem’s late six came off yet another dropped chance, this time the culprit was Shivam Dube, who misjudged a catch at the third-man region.For India, despite the five missed opportunities, their bowlers kept Pakistan in check, but the lack of discipline in the field left the contest delicately poised heading into the chase.",Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill put on 100-run stand in 8.4 overs. Pakistan seamers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf started to abuse them in Punjabi.

Poll What do you think about Pakistan's batting approach in the recent match against India? Too timid Aggressive enough Just right Needs improvement

Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif launched a scathing attack at Salman Ali Agha's team's ""timid"" approach as they suffered another defeat against an unstoppable-looking India.""This match wasn’t enjoyable,"" Latif told TimesofIndia.com after Pakistan's six-wicket loss in the Super 4s against India on Sunday at the Dubai International Stadium.""Pakistan were batting so well, how did it suddenly turn bad? You didn’t even try to be aggressive. They gave up. Why didn’t they try to attack in the middle overs, I don’t know,"" said Latif, while pointing out the middle-over phase, where Pakistan failed to hit a single boundary for 37 balls.Pakistan were in the driving seat until Saim Ayub got out. Hussain Talat, who was promoted at No. 4, forged a run-a-ball 17-run stand with Sahibzada Farhan, which Rashid felt derailed Pakistan's momentum.""Sahibzada Farhan and Hussain Talat had a 17-run partnership in 17 balls. Farhan scored 5 off 6 deliveries, and Talat made 10 off 11. At that point, Pakistan was in control.""You should have gone for your shots, even if you got out. Instead, you got out after wasting time,"" said Rashid.Latif, who played 37 Tests and 166 ODIs for Pakistan, also lamented all-rounder Mohammad Nawaz, who looked all at sea during his 19-ball 21 knock.""Then Mohammad Nawaz came, and he too played slowly, never tried to accelerate the scoring rate. That’s why I don’t trust their batting or bowling,"" he said.The way this Asia Cup has gone so far, it is a battle to see who takes on India in the final. Such has been India's dominance that they are almost guaranteed a spot in the summit clash.""We are yet to play a perfect game, but we are getting there. A great game, but in the powerplay they took the game away from us,"" Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha said in the post-match presentation.""Looking back, with the position we were in after 10 overs, we could have got 10-15 more. 170-180 is a good total, but in the powerplay they batted well, that was the difference.""If you see the bowlers are going for runs, you need to change it, that's how it goes in T20s. There's a lot of positives — the way Fakhar batted, Farhan batted and Harry bowled.

“Are umpire se to mil le”

Exchanging notes? Gautam Gambhir in a long chat with UAE coach Lalchand Rajput

India’s six-wicket win over Pakistan in the Asia Cup Super Four clash in Dubai may have been convincing on the scoreboard, but the bigger talking point came after the final ball was bowled. Head coach Gautam Gambhir , standing near the boundary line, was caught on camera telling his players,– a remark that perfectly summed up the unusual post-match scenes.Click here to watch the video For the second time in a week, Indian players refused to engage in the customary handshake with their Pakistani opponents. Instead, after Tilak Varma struck the winning boundary to finish the chase at 174-4, the batters walked back to the dugout without acknowledging the opposition.A little later, some Indian players came back out but only to shake hands with the umpires and match referee Andy Pycroft. Gambhir’s nudge to “at least greet the officials” made it clear that while India’s stance against Pakistan would hold firm, there was still respect for those overseeing the contest.This mirrored what had happened at the toss earlier in the evening. Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav once again avoided shaking hands with Pakistan skipper Salman Agha, going straight to commentator Ravi Shastri and the match referee instead. He even shared an embrace with the India legend.The gesture – or lack of it – has now become one of the defining stories of this Asia Cup.On the field, India were dominant. Abhishek Sharma ’s blistering 74 off 39 balls set the tone before Shubman Gill and Tilak Varma ensured a smooth finish. Yet once again, the cricketing brilliance was overshadowed by off-field tensions.Besides the lack of handshakes, there was more tension between players, with heated exchanges, controversial gestures and more dominating India's successful chase. Haris Rauf, Abhishek Sharma and Sahibzada Farhan all made headlines with their gestures, be it celebratory or provocative.The handshake row shows no signs of ending, and Gambhir’s words have now added another chapter to the drama.","India beat Pakistan by six wickets in the Asia Cup Super Four clash in Dubai.

Poll Who do you think will reach the finals of the Asia Cup 2025? India Bangladesh Pakistan Sri Lanka

NEW DELHI: India and Bangladesh have made winning starts to their Super 4s campaigns in the ongoing Asia Cup 2025 in the UAE, but the race to the final is still wide open. Defending champions India extended their dominance over arch-rivals Pakistan with a six-wicket victory on Sunday, a week after beating them in the group stage. Bangladesh, meanwhile, handed Sri Lanka a four-wicket defeat on Saturday.The results leave India and Bangladesh leading the Super Four standings with two points each. India hold the edge with a superior net run rate of +0.689, while Bangladesh sit at +0.121. Pakistan and Sri Lanka are yet to open their accounts, but with four games left in this stage, both remain in contention for a spot in the summit clash., the path is straightforward but steep: they, first against Sri Lanka on Tuesday and then against Bangladesh on Thursday. Two victories would give Salman Agha’s men four points, potentially setting up a blockbuster third showdown with India in the final next Sunday.on Tuesday, it will knock the islanders out of contention after two straight losses.Table-toppers India and Bangladesh are set to clash on Wednesday, and given India’s dominant form, they are widely expected to book a spot in the final unbeaten. That would leave Pakistan needing to overcome Bangladesh in their last Super 4s fixture on Thursday — effectively turning it into a virtual semi-final.In such a scenario, the final Super Four match between India and Sri Lanka on Friday would carry little significance in terms of qualification for the title clash.Should this scenario unfold, fans would witness three consecutive weekends of India-Pakistan clashes — an unprecedented streak in a long while.India’s latest win over Pakistan was set up by opener Abhishek Sharma , who blazed 74 off 39 balls, and Shubman Gill , who contributed 47 in a century stand. Despite a brief wobble in the middle order, Tilak Varma and Hardik Pandya saw the team home with ease. Earlier, Shivam Dube’s double strike curtailed Pakistan’s promising start, exposing the frailties in their batting depth.Pakistan, however, showed flashes of fight. Sahibzada Farhan’s 58 and Saim Ayub’s return to form after three ducks were encouraging signs. Yet the bowling, led by Abrar Ahmed, has failed to contain stronger opponents.A potential third clash could also see tempers flare once again, given the fact that there were multiple instances where India and Pakistan players exchanged heated words. Abhishek Sharma got heated with Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf clashed with both Shubman Gill and Abhishek and several more.As Sri Lanka and Pakistan square off in a virtual do-or-die clash on Tuesday, the equation is simple: survival.

How Shubman Gill is getting ready for Pakistan challenge in Asia Cup

NEW DELHI: India’s vice-captain Shubman Gill set social media buzzing on Sunday night with a four-word message that perfectly summed up the mood after India’s fiery Asia Cup Super Four win over Pakistan in Dubai.Shortly after India clinched a six-wicket victory — their second over Pakistan in the ongoing tournament — Gill shared action shots from the match on social media platforms with the caption: “Game speaks, not words.”The post, cryptic yet loaded with meaning, quickly went viral, drawing massive engagement from fans who saw it as a sharp response to the heated on-field exchanges during the high-voltage clash.The game itself was as charged as Gill suggested. India chased down Pakistan’s 172-run target with seven balls to spare, riding on a blistering 74 from opener Abhishek Sharma and a fluent 47 from Gill. The duo added 105 runs in just nine overs, silencing Pakistan’s much-vaunted pace attack.But beyond the runs, it was the simmering tension between the players that stole headlines. From the very first over, Abhishek went after Shaheen Afridi with a top-edged six and followed it up with verbal volleys.Gill, too, locked eyes with Shaheen after a crisp extra-cover boundary, while later in the innings, Abhishek and Haris Rauf clashed mid-pitch, forcing the umpire to intervene.The needle continued even after the final ball. For the second time in this Asia Cup, Indian players walked off without shaking hands with their Pakistani counterparts, a move that further highlighted the hostility between the two sides.Gill’s message, then, struck a chord. In just four words, he appeared to brush aside all the chatter, gesturing that India’s performance on the field was answer enough to Pakistan’s aggression.While the tense atmosphere dominated, Abhishek Sharma's celebration was one that was rooted in ""love"". After the win, the batter explained that his 'L' gesture meant ""love"" and was aimed at all the Indian supporters.","India beat Pakistan by six wickets in the Asia Cup Super Four match in Dubai.

'My job is to play': Haris Rauf stays calm as Pakistan ride out Asia Cup drama

WATCH:

WACTH:

NEW DELHI: The high-octane India vs Pakistan clash in the Asia Cup 2025 Super Four at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday, did not just serve up a six-wicket win for the defending champions India — it also delivered fresh controversy.Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf found himself in the middle of a storm after he taunted Indian fans with a provocative “6-0” gesture near the boundary ropes, a moment that has since gone viral on social media.The gesture, captured in multiple videos and photos, showed Rauf raising his hand to signal “6-0,” a reference to Pakistan’s unverified and politically charged claims of downing six Indian fighter jets during a four-day military scuffle following Operation Sindoor. During the match in Dubai, the pacer even acted out the motion of a crashing plane in front of the fans, further fuelling tensions.The incident unfolded while Rauf was fielding close to a packed Indian section of the crowd near the boundary rope. Fans had been chanting “Kohli, Kohli” to rile him up, a reminder of Virat Kohli’s iconic straight six off his bowling in the T20 World Cup 2022. In response, the 31-year-old pacer gestured towards them with the controversial signal, triggering loud boos from Indian supporters and sparking outrage online.The cricket, however, was dominated by India. Chasing 172, Abhishek Sharma hammered a blistering 74 off just 39 balls, including six fours and five towering sixes. His 105-run opening stand with Shubman Gill (47) laid the perfect platform, as Tilak Varma (30*) and Hardik Pandya (7*) sealed the win in 18.5 overs.While Rauf opted to gesture in a provocative manner, India's Abhishek Sharma took the other route, as he held up his hand to gesture the letter 'L'. He later explained that the 'L' stood for 'love' and that it was aimed at the Indian supporters.On-field tensions between Rauf and Indian players also flared. In the fifth over, after Gill cracked a crisp boundary, Rauf exchanged heated words with Abhishek Sharma, forcing umpire Gazi Sohel to step in.

Poll What do you think about the PCB skipping the mandatory media meet? It's unacceptable and should be penalized It's not a big deal It could affect their reputation

NEW DELHI: Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has sharply criticised the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) over their recent conduct in the ongoing Asia Cup 2025, particularly their handling of tensions following India’s decision to skip the customary handshake. The move by the Indian team, led by Suryakumar Yadav, drew a complaint from the PCB to the International Cricket Council (ICC), seeking the removal of match referee Andy Pycroft. The ICC, however, rejected Pakistan’s request.Gavaskar said he was baffled by the PCB’s demand, pointing out that handshakes are not mandatory in cricket. “The PCB complaining about it was hard to understand, as there is nothing in the rule books that says handshakes are mandatory. There are many previous instances in different sports where opponents who have clashed have not shaken hands after their match has ended. The ICC quite rightly ignored the protest, if indeed there was one made as per media reports,” he wrote in his Sportstar column.The veteran also questioned the PCB’s decision to skip the mandatory pre-match press conference, calling it a more serious concern. “What needs to be looked at is the avoiding of the mandatory media meet on the eve of the match by the Pakistani contingent.They did not have to send the captain, players, or the coach. Anyone among the large support staff could have met the media. That did not happen, and it will be interesting to see if any action is taken for avoiding what is mandatory,” Gavaskar added.Gavaskar further criticised Pakistan for delaying their must-win game against the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which started an hour late. “The other thing that left a sour taste in the mouth is holding up the game and starting it one hour late. If the PCB had any issues to discuss with and about the match referee Andy Pycroft, then it had two full days after their loss to India and before the game against the UAE in which to do so. By keeping everybody in suspense and not even turning up at the ground until almost the toss time, they held the game to ransom,” he said.The cricketing legend also dismissed Pakistan’s claim that they had secured an apology from the ICC, calling it misleading. “There is simply no excuse for delaying the start of the game for an hour while haggling to get an apology from the match referee for something that was also not in any of the rule books. Then, despite the ICC… saying there was no apology given, the PCB insisted that they had secured one and so agreed to play. They pounced on the words ‘regrettable miscommunication’ to say that this was the apology,” Gavaskar wrote.","Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has sharply criticised the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) over their recent conduct in the ongoing Asia Cup 2025.

'Conditions didn’t let us score 200': Salman Ali Agha defends Pakistan after Asia Cup losses

Pakistan skipper Salman Agha struck a dramatic note after his team’s five-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup 2025 Super Four clash in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday, declaring that Shaheen Shah Afridi was an “asset” and a true “match-winner” for the side. The win not only revived Pakistan’s campaign but also kept alive the tantalising possibility of a blockbuster India vs Pakistan final.Pakistan’s bowlers strangled Sri Lanka to 133/8, with Afridi, who went wicketless against India, leading the charge. The left-arm pacer claimed three wickets in a fiery spell of 3/28. Hussain Talat (2/18) and Haris Rauf (2/37) also chipped in, while Kamindu Mendis fought a lone battle for Sri Lanka with a fighting 50 off 44 balls.Chasing the target, Pakistan made a strong start with Sahibzada Farhan (24) and Fakhar Zaman (17) adding 45 for the first wicket. But the innings collapsed to 80/5, undone by Wanindu Hasaranga (2/27) and Maheesh Theekshana (2/24). Just when Sri Lanka sensed an upset, Mohammed Nawaz (38* off 24) and Hussain Talat (32* off 30) dug deep, adding 58 runs for the sixth wicket to seal victory with two overs to spare.Salman admitted the contest was far from flawless. “Cannot say it is a perfect game.We lost four wickets in 3 overs. Apart from that, it was a perfect game. Our fielding coach (Shane McDermott) has been working really hard with us. We have named him Rockstar. Shaheen has been bowling really well. He is an asset to us. He is a match-winner,” the skipper said.He also praised Nawaz and Talat: “Nawaz, as a batter, has so much potential. Hope both can continue. I know Talat for several years. Really happy for him. Abrar has been bowling well. Whenever we are in a difficult situation, I go to him.”Sri Lanka captain Charith Asalanka rued the early collapse. “If you lose 5 wickets before the 10th over, it will be hard. The surface was good. They bowled and fielded really well in the first 8-9 overs,” he admitted. Still, he found positives, hailing Kamindu Mendis’ fifty and Hasaranga’s all-round efforts.With this result, Pakistan climbed to second place in the Super Fours table with two points, while Sri Lanka slumped to the bottom with two losses. The road to the final remains wide open, with India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh all in contention.","Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by five wickets in Asia Cup 2025 Super Four clash.

WATCH:

Poll Should disciplinary action be taken against players for provocative gestures? Yes, to maintain sportsmanship. No, it's just competitive spirit. Only if it escalates further.

The controversy surrounding Pakistan’s Asia Cup 2025 campaign refuses to die down, with fresh visuals now dragging another player into the storm. Just days after Haris Rauf’s provocative “6-0” gesture towards Indian fans sparked outrage during Sunday’s Super Four clash in Dubai, pace bowling all-rounder Faheem Ashraf has also been caught indulging in the same act.New viral footage from the India-Pakistan encounter shows Faheem, while fielding near the boundary, gesturing “6-0” with his fingers toward Indian supporters. This revelation has deepened the criticism of Pakistan’s players for mixing political and military references with cricketing contests.Rauf had already invited backlash after making fighter jet crash signals and the same “6-0” hand gesture, a reference linked by Pakistani media to unverified claims about downing six Indian jets during Operation Sindoor. He repeated it again after dismissing Sanju Samson for 13, further inflaming tensions. India, however, had the last laugh, winning the contest by six wickets and securing their second victory over Pakistan in the tournament.While the cricketing world continues to debate whether disciplinary action should be taken, India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate brushed off the incident on Tuesday. “Some of the things Haris did was not our concern.We fought with the bat and showed them our strength,” he said ahead of India’s next Super Fours clash against Bangladesh.Pakistan captain Salman Agha, on the other hand, chose to avoid controversy, focusing instead on his team’s positives despite the defeat. “The batting was a lot better today, and that’s a positive. But to win, you have to excel in all three facets of the game,” Agha admitted.The gestures have, however, reignited discussions on sportsmanship in high-pressure rivalries, especially since Pakistan’s U-17 football team was also caught in a similar storm a day later. Striker Muhammad Abdullah’s “sipping tea” celebration against India in the SAFF U-17 Championship in Colombo was seen as a provocative nod to the 2019 Abhinandan episode, drawing mixed reactions online.",Faheem Ashraf caught on camera making '6-0' gesture towards Indian fans.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan survived a fiery spell from Wanindu Hasaranga to edge past Sri Lanka by five wickets in a high-stakes Super 4 clash at the Asia Cup on Tuesday, keeping their tournament hopes alive. Chasing a modest 134, Pakistan stumbled at times but ultimately finished at 138 for five.The conditions were tricky for batting, yet Pakistan’s openers attacked from the outset. Sahibzada Farhan (24) compensated for a slow start from Fakhar Zaman (17 off 19 balls), launching some aggressive shots, including a 6, 6, 4 sequence off pacer Nuwan Thushara.Maheesh Theekshana (2/24) struck in the sixth over, dismissing Farhan and soon after Zaman, who had earlier been struck on the helmet by Dushmantha Chameera. Hasaranga (2/27) then took charge, claiming Saim Ayub and skipper Salman Agha, including a stunning ground-level catch at mid-off.His delivery that pinned back Ayub’s stump was a perfect example of subtle seam movement.In both dismissals, Hasaranga mimicked Pakistan spinner Abrar Ahmed’s hands-on-chest celebration, in retaliation for earlier banter.At 80 for five, the match was delicately poised, with Pakistan still needing 54 runs.Hussain Talat (32*, 30 balls) and Mohammad Nawaz (38*, 24 balls) calmly guided the chase, sealing a tense victory with two overs to spare.Earlier, Pakistan’s pacers had troubled the Sri Lankan lineup despite Kamindu Mendis’ elegant 50, restricting them to 133 for eight.Sri Lanka suffered an early collapse, losing in-form Kusal Mendis and Pathum Nissanka cheaply. Shaheen Shah Afridi (3/28) struck first, trapping Mendis and then Nissanka, with Talat and wicketkeeper Haris completing the dismissals.Skipper Charith Asalanka and Kusal Perera attempted a mini-recovery with a 25-run partnership, but Perera was soon caught off Faheem Ashraf’s well-judged diving effort. In the eighth over, Talat and Rauf removed Asalanka and Dasun Shanaka in successive deliveries, leaving Sri Lanka reeling at 58 for five.Mendis’ determined fifty and a 43-run partnership with Chamika Karunaratne pushed Sri Lanka past 100, but it wasn’t enough to challenge Pakistan, who held their nerve under pressure to secure a crucial win.","Pakistan defeated Sri Lanka by five wickets in a high-stakes Super 4 clash at the Asia Cup on Tuesday.

England Ashes squad

:

NEW DELHI: England captain Ben Stokes is “on track” for the Ashes despite a recent shoulder injury, selectors confirmed Tuesday, as they named part-time spinner Will Jacks in a surprise inclusion for the Test series in Australia.Stokes missed the final Test against India at the Oval, which began on July 31, as England levelled the series 2-2. The selectors said the all-rounder “remains on track to be available” for the start of the much-anticipated five-Test series against arch-rivals Australia, beginning in Perth on November 21. However, his ability to contribute fully with the ball remains uncertain.Jacks, traditionally seen as a white-ball specialist, won his only two Test caps in Pakistan nearly three years ago. The 26-year-old all-rounder has been included as a back-up off-spinner to Shoaib Bashir, ahead of Jack Leach, Liam Dawson, and Rehan Ahmed. He has 49 first-class wickets at 42.22 and 15 wickets across formats for England. Bashir is fit again following a finger injury. Harry Brook is confirmed as England’s vice-captain, replacing Ollie Pope, who is included in the 16-man squad as a batsman. Durham pacer Mark Wood returns after missing the entire English season due to a knee injury, while Jofra Archer is just two Tests into his comeback after multiple fitness setbacks.Matthew Potts, also from Durham, has been selected despite last playing a Test in December 2024.England drew 2-2 with Australia at home in the last Ashes series in 2023 and have not won in Australia since 2010/11. The five Tests will be played in Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney.Before the Ashes, England will tour New Zealand for three T20s and three one-day internationals.Ben Stokes (capt), Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Shoaib Bashir, Jacob Bethell, Harry Brook, Brydon Carse, Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Will Jacks, Ollie Pope, Matthew Potts, Joe Root, Jamie Smith (wk), Josh Tongue, Mark Wood.","Stokes missed the final Test against India at the Oval, which began on July 31.

BENGALURU: For the first time since 2008, a familiar name from the Karnataka Ranji Trophy probables is missing. Although it was known that the KSCA think-tank had moved past swashbuckling batter Manish Pandey, Tuesday’s announcement of the probables added a sense of finality to Pandey’s illustrious career with the state. With plenty of lucrative offers, the 36-year-old, who was out of reckoning in white-ball cricket since last season, was expected to move to another state, but with the transfer window closing in a week, Pandey has made no move.Two players – Karun Nair and Sharath Srinivas – returning to the state fold from Vidarbha and Tripura have made the cut among the 37 probables. With Karnataka eyeing a turnaround in bowling, especially the spin department, more than half a dozen spinners have been included. Apart from the usual suspects like Shreyas Gopal and Hardik Raj, the addition of promising and consistent talents, including left-arm spinner Paras Gurbax Arya, Shikhar Shetty, Madhav Bajaj, and Mohsin Khan, is a welcome move. Four wicketkeepers are in the mix, with Sharath Srinivas and BR Sharath joined by KL Shrijith and the in-form Kruthik Krishna.KL Rahul, who returned to the Ranji Trophy fold last season after a five-year hiatus, has been included along with Mayank Agarwal, Devdutt Padikkal, Prasidh Krishna, Vidwath Kaverappa and Vyshak Vijaykumar.The KSCA also named probables for the age-group teams and the senior women’s team.Among the coaching staff, there is no major shake-up, with Yere Goud and Mansur Ali Khan continuing with the senior men’s team. Interestingly, Goud, who is currently on national duty with the India U-19 team in Australia, is expected to join the team less than a week before their season opening against Saurashtra in Rajkot on Oct 15.More than three months after they took over the role of selectors, the KSCA officially announced the selection committees.Unlike last year, when there was only a junior and senior selection committee with a common chairperson, there are three men’s committees named. The senior committee will be headed by former Karnataka spinner and seasoned selector Anand Katti, while KL Ashwath will helm the U-23 selection panel with Ramesh Rao P coming in as junior panel (U-14, U-16, and U-19) chairman. Former all-rounder Amit Verma has been named in both the senior and U-23 panels, while Suneel Raju has made it to the U-23 committee.Senior: Chairman: Anand Katti.

NEW DELHI: Two days after making himself unavailable for the ongoing India A match against Australia A in Lucknow, it has Shreyas Iyer has conveyed to the national selectors and the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) that he wants to opt out of red-ball cricket.TOI has learnt that Iyer, who is about to turn 31 in two months, got in touch with chief selector Ajit Agarkar and informed him about his decision. “Iyer spoke to Agarkar and conveyed that it’s getting tougher for him to endure the rigours of first-class cricket. He is experiencing some discomfort in his back. That’s why he has pulled out of the India A match,” a BCCI source told TOI on Tuesday.The selectors are due to meet in a day or two to pick the Test team for the two-match West Indies series at home beginning in Ahmedabad on Oct 2. Iyer, who has been out of reckoning in Test cricket since Feb 2024, was appointed the captain of the India A team. Iyer struggled to get going in the Duleep Trophy match this month where he scored 25 and 12 before managing to score just eight runs for India A last week. He had a very strong domestic first-class season which prompted the selectors to give him the India A captaincy. It is understood that the selectors were deliberating if they wanted to bring Iyer back in Test cricket with the West Indies series.Iyer has cemented his place in ODI format. He enjoyed a terrific IPL season this year but couldn’t make India’s T20I team due to cut-throat competition. Iyer’s credentials took a beating when he struggled to perform against the fast and short balls away from home. The selectors ran out of patience with him when he failed in two Tests on good pitches against England at home in 2024. Iyer played 14 Tests with his only century coming on his debut in Kanpur against New Zealand in 2021.The selectors and the team management are trying to firm up the middle order in Test cricket with Karun Nair also walking on thin ice. With Rishabh Pant unavailable, it will be interesting to see if the selectors go back to Sarfaraz Khan.",Shreyas Iyer wants to opt out of red-ball cricket.

NEW DELHI: India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate addressed the issue of Pakistan batter Sahibzada Farhan’s provocative celebration after reaching his fifty, where he mimicked firing a gun with his bat. Doeschate emphasized that India’s focus remained on controlling their own behavior and “sticking to cricket. ”“They had a very good start. I don’t think they got carried away with it. We managed to pull it back really well after 10 overs. Given the situation, you can see why the opposition behaved that way, but we were very focused on how we wanted to behave. I think we stuck to the cricket really well,” he said.He added, “It would have been easy to lose our minds at that point, given the celebration and some of the words from the Pakistan bowling unit. I thought the guys stuck to the task of getting the job done and winning the game. Like I said, not at our very best—lots to work on—but still managing to win comfortably is very pleasing for us.”Doeschate also spoke about India’s middle-order plans, particularly Sanju Samson’s role at No. 5. With skipper Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma slated for No. 3 and 4, Samson is adjusting to the responsibilities of pacing an innings in that position.“Yeah, he has had two outings now, two decent chances, and he’s still figuring out how to play that role. I think the wicket was a little tighter in the Pakistan game,” he said.Samson made a 17-ball 13 in the Super 4s clash against Pakistan.“But certainly with the way Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma are performing at the top, and your captain batting at three alongside Tilak, we really need someone dependable at No. 5. We believe Sanju is the best man for that job and have no doubt he’ll figure out how to play that role in the future,” Doeschate noted.",India defeated Pakistan by six wickets in Super Fours clash on Sunday.

Poll Who was the standout bowler in the match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka? Shaheen Afridi Haris Rauf Abrar Ahmed Hussain Talat

As Pakistan and Sri Lanka faced off in a must-win Asia Cup Super Four match in Abu Dhabi, both teams gave it all they got in the first innings to stay alive in the race for the final.Sri Lanka, batting first at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium, were restricted to 133/8 in their 20 overs. Shaheen Afridi was Pakistan's best man with the ball, setting the tone with three wickets, while Haris Rauf and Hussain Talat chipped in with two each. Abrar Ahmed bowled with amazing control and picked up the wicket of Wanindu Hasaranga , conceding just 8 runs in his four overs.The biggest talking point, however, came when Abrar dismissed Hasaranga. The spinner trapped the Sri Lankan star and then sent him off with Hasaranga’s own trademark celebration. Abrar crossed his arms over his chest, shook them in his trademark style and stared at the batter, imitating the move that Hasaranga usually performs after taking wickets.The moment instantly went viral online, with fans taking delight in the added spice in what was already a tense affair.For Sri Lanka, Chamika Karunaratne held on in the end with an unbeaten 17, while Asalanka (20) and Kamindu Mendis (50) tried to keep the innings together. But the early wickets meant they could only manage a below-par total.Earlier, Pakistan won the toss and chose to bowl first. Their stunning effort with the ball left Sri Lanka with little to defend as both teams look to secure a place in the Asia Cup 2025 final.","Abrar Ahmed used Wanindu Hasaranga's celebration on himself after he got the Sri Lankan's wicket in the Asia Cup Super Fours match.

WATCH:

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan U-17 football team’s dramatic 2-3 loss to India in the SAFF U-17 Championship on Monday, in Colombo, not only highlighted the thrilling nature of the match but also drew attention for a controversial celebration that went viral on social media.The pulsating encounter at Racecourse International Stadium saw India top Group B, with goals from Dallulmuan Gangte (31’), Gunleiba Wangkheirakpam (63’), and Rahan Ahmed (73’) securing victory. Pakistan had responded through Muhammad Abdullah’s penalty (43’) and Hamza Yasir’s rebound strike (70’) to keep the contest on even keel.However, it was Muhammad Abdullah’s post-goal antics that caught the public eye. After leveling the match at 1-1, Abdullah ran to the corner flag, sat down, and mimicked sipping tea — a move interpreted by many as a provocative nod to the 2019 incident involving Indian Air Force Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was filmed drinking tea after being captured in Pakistan. The gesture sparked debate online, with opinions divided over whether it was playful or inflammatory.The controversy comes hot on the heels of Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf’s infamous “6-0” gesture during India’s six-wicket win in the Asia Cup Super Fours clash.Rauf, stationed near the boundary rope, used his fingers to indicate “0-6” in response to Indian fans, referencing unfounded claims about a past border incident. Videos of the action went viral, with Rauf facing widespread criticism from Indian fans for the provocative display.On the field, the match itself was tightly contested. India struck first through Gangte, only for Abdullah’s penalty to level the score. The second half saw India regain the lead via Wangkheirakpam, before Yasir equalized with a rebound. Ultimately, Rahan Ahmed’s winner in the 73rd minute sealed a tense victory for India, showcasing composure under pressure and clinical finishing.The game featured a mix of tactical battles and high-intensity moments, with goalkeepers Manashjyoti Baruah and Saamar Razzak making key saves. India’s precise passing and coordinated attacks exploited gaps in Pakistan’s defence, while Pakistan’s physicality and pressing strategy kept the contest alive until the final whistle.While India celebrated topping Group B and progressing to the semi-finals, the viral “tea celebration” ensured the match remained a talking point off the pitch, adding to the ongoing debate sparked by Haris Rauf’s controversial gesture in cricket hours earlier.","Pakistan lost 2-3 to India in the SAFF U-17 Championship on Monday.

Paris Saint-Germain winger Ousmane Dembele capped off a career-defining year by winning the Ballon d’Or 2025 on Monday, rewarding his pivotal role in PSG’s historic Champions League triumph. The Frenchman edged out Barcelona teenager Lamine Yamal to succeed 2024 winner Rodri as football’s most prestigious individual prize returned to Paris.Dembele, 28, enjoyed a spectacular campaign after being converted into a centre-forward following Kylian Mbappe’s departure to Real Madrid. He delivered an astonishing 35 goals across all competitions, firing PSG to a domestic double and their long-awaited first Champions League crown. The crowning moment came in Munich, where PSG demolished Inter Milan 5-0 in the final.“I really don’t have the words. It was an incredible season with PSG,” said a visibly emotional Dembele at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris. The Frenchman credited head coach Luis Enrique — who also took home the award for club coach of the year — as “like a father” in guiding his transformation.Despite celebrating individual glory, Dembele stressed the team’s role in his success: “It is an individual trophy but it was really the collective that won it.”While Dembele lifted the men’s prize, Aitana Bonmati of Spain claimed the Women’s Ballon d’Or for the third year running, beating her international teammate Mariona Caldentey. Bonmati, 27, starred at Euro 2025 despite Spain losing the final to England, and said her continued success was down to her teams at club and country level.The ceremony also saw Lamine Yamal, still just 18, claim the Kopa Trophy for best young male player for a second consecutive year. PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma took home the Yashin Trophy before his summer move to Manchester City, while England’s Hannah Hampton was named best women’s goalkeeper. England boss Sarina Wiegman won best women’s coach.Dembele’s triumph ends years of Ballon d’Or dominance by Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, and more recently Rodri, underlining PSG’s rise as a true European powerhouse. With his name etched into football history, the 2018 World Cup winner admitted the award had never been a career target but reflected: “I worked hard for the team to win the Champions League — this is the reward.”",Paris Saint-Germain winger Ousmane Dembele wins Ballon d'Or 2025.

Ferran Torres struck twice for champions Barcelona as they beat Getafe 3-0 on Sunday to stay on Real Madrid's tails at the top of La Liga.Dani Olmo was also on target for the Catalans, who trail leaders Madrid by two points after Xabi Alonso's side beat Espanyol on Saturday to maintain their 100 percent record.Atletico Madrid's stuttering start to the season continued in a 1-1 draw at Mallorca, in which their striker Julian Alvarez missed a penalty.Playing at the 6,000 capacity Johan Cruyff stadium besides their training ground again as the club waits for the necessary licences to reopen their renovated Camp Nou home, Barcelona dominated an unambitious Getafe team.Despite his brace against Newcastle in the Champions League, German coach Hansi Flick left Marcus Rashford on the bench, with Spanish media reporting that it was because the England international was late for a morning meeting.Flick has dropped other players from the line-up for the same offence in the past, including defender Jules Kounde.""(Rotation) is normal because every three or four days we have a match, we need fresh legs on the pitch,"" said Flick, when asked why Rashford did not start.Rashford's replacement as the stand-in for injured teenage superstar Lamine Yamal, Torres, took his chance with both hands.""We have a lot of matches so it's really good to have everyone on this (level of) performance,"" added Flick.The Spaniard opened the scoring with a powerful finish at the end of a slick move, with Olmo backheeling the ball into his path in the box.Torres's second finish was even better, guided into the bottom left corner from outside the box after Raphinha sent him through on goal.The forward crashed a shot off the bar as a first half hat-trick beckoned.Several Barca players lost their temper before the break as Getafe put in several hard and late tackles, with Kounde the victim of many of them.Flick sent on Rashford for Raphinha at half-time, perhaps in order to save the Brazilian from a potential red card.""A lot of the time, they don't try to do anything apart from too many fouls, in my opinion, but we managed it well,"" Torres told DAZN.""I said to the team: we have to focus on our match, not on their match,"" said Flick.Rashford created Barcelona's third, zipping inside from the right flank and unselfishly cutting the ball back for Olmo to finish, and had two efforts of his own saved by Getafe goalkeeper David Soria.The only bad news for Barca was substitute Fermin Lopez appearing to pull up hurt in stoppage time.- Frustrated Atletico -Earlier, Atletico were held by Mallorca despite outplaying the hosts.Diego Simeone's side, reduced to 10 men after Alexander Sorloth's red card, took the lead through Conor Gallagher but Vedat Muriqi levelled in the 85th minute.The draw left Atletico 12th, having won just one of their first five league matches.""I think we dominated the game from start to end, until we scored and they, with one more player, turned up the pressure,"" Atletico captain Koke told DAZN.""It's clear that what matters is scoring goals and they don't want to go in.""The draw leaves Atletico nine points behind leaders Real Madrid, and seven behind Barcelona.Licking their wounds after a painful late Champions League defeat at Liverpool in midweek, Atletico were left with a similar feeling.""We have to improve to hold on in games... (but) we're building a new team, a lot of players have come in. We're on the right path,"" said Simeone.Mallorca goalkeeper Leo Roman made several saves, including from Alvarez's penalty after captain Antonio Raillo handled David Hancko's shot in the first half.The Rojiblancos' job was made harder when Sorloth was dismissed for a high challenge on Raillo in the 72nd minute, but a few minutes later they took the lead as Gallagher netted a rebound.Simeone's side could not hold on and Muriqi nodded the hosts level with five minutes remaining.",Ferran Torres scores twice as Barcelona beat Getafe 3-0 in La Liga.

The football world’s spotlight turns to Paris on Monday, 22 September 2025, as the 69th Ballon d’Or ceremony takes centre stage at the Théâtre du Châtelet. The night promises not only the crowning of the best male and female footballers of the 2024/25 season but also recognition across a wide array of categories celebrating talent, leadership, goalscoring brilliance, and humanitarian impact.First awarded in 1956 by France Football, the Ballon d’Or is the sport’s most prestigious individual prize. While Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo dominated the award for over a decade, recent years have opened the door for new icons, with Manchester City’s Rodri lifting the trophy in 2024.Since 2024, the award has been co-organised by UEFA and Groupe Amaury, with the voting process still conducted by journalists worldwide.This year features a record number of honours, including three new women’s categories – the Women’s Yashin Trophy, Women’s Gerd Müller Trophy, and Women’s Kopa Trophy.The men’s race is billed as a duel between Ousmane Dembélé and Lamine Yamal. Dembélé, reinvented as a lethal forward at PSG, scored 35 goals in a treble-winning season and is widely tipped as favourite. “It’s nice after a wonderful season with PSG… the Ballon d’Or is the individual Holy Grail,” he told Le Monde.On the other side is 18-year-old Lamine Yamal, Barcelona’s prodigy, who notched 18 goals and lifted both La Liga and Copa del Rey. “I don’t dream of winning one Ballon d’Or, I dream of winning lots,” Yamal declared recently.Other big names in contention include Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah, Harry Kane, Vinícius Júnior, Jude Bellingham and PSG’s star-studded squad featuring Hakimi, Donnarumma, and Vitinha.In the women’s category, Aitana Bonmatí (Barcelona/Spain) will try to secure her third straight Ballon d’Or, though competition is fierce. Teammate Alexia Putellas and England stars Lucy Bronze, Alessia Russo, and Leah Williamson could challenge strongly.For the Club of the Year, Barcelona, Liverpool, PSG, Chelsea, Botafogo (men) and Arsenal, Barcelona, Chelsea, OL Lyonnes, Orlando Pride (women) are nominated.For the coaching awards, Antonio Conte (Napoli) and Luis Enrique (PSG) headline the men’s Johan Cruyff Trophy list, while Sarina Wiegman (England) and Sonia Bompastor (Chelsea) lead the women’s nominees.An international jury of journalists casts votes:Each juror selects 10 players, with descending points (15–1).

Villa remain winless

Gabriel Martinelli struck deep into stoppage time to earn Arsenal a 1-1 draw against Manchester City on Sunday, keeping the Gunners within sight of the Premier League summit.City had led from the ninth minute after Erling Haaland finished off a swift counter-attack. The Norwegian forward began the move in his own half, linked up with Tijjani Reijnders, and raced clear to slot past David Raya. Haaland’s goal was his 13th of the season for club and country.Arsenal found it difficult to respond in a subdued first half, their best chance falling to Noni Madueke, whose strike was pushed away by Gianluigi Donnarumma. The Italian goalkeeper has settled quickly since joining City and produced another key save to deny Eberechi Eze in the second half.Mikel Arteta introduced Bukayo Saka and Eze after the break in search of creativity, but City sat deeper as Pep Guardiola withdrew Haaland and Phil Foden to reinforce his defence. That approach looked set to secure three points until Martinelli, on as a substitute, latched onto Eze’s lofted pass and lifted the ball over Donnarumma in the 93rd minute.The result leaves Arsenal second in the table, five points behind leaders Liverpool, while City sit ninth.Aston Villa’s poor start under Unai Emery showed no signs of easing as they were held 1-1 at 10-man Sunderland.The hosts lost Reinildo Mandava to a red card in the 33rd minute for an off-the-ball kick at Matty Cash. Villa, without a goal in their previous four league outings, finally ended that drought when Cash’s long-range strike beat goalkeeper Robin Roefs in the 41st minute.But the advantage was short-lived. Wilson Isidor levelled eight minutes later, capitalising on Granit Xhaka’s header for his third goal in as many league matches at the Stadium of Light.Emery admitted his side failed to impose themselves despite the numerical advantage. “It should have been easier to take advantage (against 10 men) but we were not playing with our identity, with the ideas we have been building in the last three years,” he said, as quoted by AFP.The draw leaves Villa in the bottom three with three points from five games, while Sunderland move into seventh.",Gabriel Martinelli scores in stoppage time to earn Arsenal a 1-1 draw against Manchester City.

Poll Is Messi the best player in MLS history? Yes No Not sure

Superstar Lionel Messi once again showcased why he is indispensable for Inter Miami, scoring two brilliant goals and creating another as his side defeated DC United 3-2 on Saturday at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The victory keeps Miami firmly in the hunt for an MLS Cup playoff spot.Messi, 38, now has 22 goals in 22 matches this season, moving to the top of the MLS scoring chart after surpassing Sam Surridge of Nashville. This marked Messi’s seventh double of the campaign, highlighting his consistent brilliance.“It was another ordinary night for him, which is totally extraordinary for any other football player,” Miami coach Javier Mascherano said. “His ability not only to score but to make the team play, to find situations, and to carry the team on his shoulders when we needed him most — that is the advantage of having him.”Miami opened the scoring in the 35th minute when Messi threaded a precise through ball to Tadeo Allende, who slotted past DC United goalkeeper Luis Barraza. Christian Benteke equalised in the 52nd minute, but Messi soon restored Miami’s lead with a composed finish from Jordi Alba’s pass in the 66th minute.Messi added a third in the 85th, dribbling past defenders before curling a left-footed strike beyond Barraza. The goal proved crucial as Jacob Murrell scored in stoppage time to make it 3-2.Mascherano also praised Messi’s off-the-ball generosity. When 19-year-old Mateo Silvetti missed a penalty, Messi’s earlier assist had been a gesture to involve a teammate seeking his first goal, reflecting the Argentine’s leadership and team spirit.With the win, Miami climbed to fifth in the Eastern Conference with 52 points. Messi’s heroics not only kept Miami’s playoff hopes alive but also reinforced why the club is eager to extend his stay in Major League Soccer beyond next year.","Lionel Messi scored twice as Inter Miami defeated DC United 3-2.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor. Massive congratulations. You are the future of this sport.”Recalling Barnard’s maiden pole, a fan also wrote, “Fantastic season, Taylor, we'll never forget that Monaco pole.”Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Barnard claimed five podiums in his first full season in Formula E.

Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

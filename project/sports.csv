Sarfaraz Khan is knocking the selectors’ door again





NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has been directed by the country’s sports ministry to seek a shift of Bangladesh’s T20 World Cup league matches from India to Sri Lanka, citing “concerns about players’ safety” following Mustafizur Rahman ’s removal from the IPL on BCCI instructions.The Shah Rukh Khan co-owned IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) released the Bangladesh left-arm pacer — bought for Rs 9.20 crore after a bidding war at last month’s auction in Abu Dhabi — in line with the BCCI’s diktat.BCB president and former Bangladesh skipper Aminul Islam Bulbul refrained from making any public comment after an emergency board meeting held in the wake of the development.However, government adviser Asif Nazrul said he has instructed the board to approach the Jay Shah-led ICC to shift Bangladesh’s four league matches — three scheduled in Kolkata and one in Mumbai — to Sri Lanka.“As the adviser in charge of the Ministry of Sports, I have instructed the Cricket Control Board to put the entire matter in writing and explain it to the ICC,” Nazrul wrote in Bengali on his Facebook page.“The board must make it clear that if a Bangladeshi cricketer, despite being under contract, cannot play in India, then the Bangladesh national team cannot feel safe travelling to India to play the World Cup.“I have also directed the board to formally request that Bangladesh’s World Cup matches be held in Sri Lanka instead,” he further wrote.Bangladesh’s four league fixtures are against West Indies (February 7), Italy (February 9) and England (February 14) in Kolkata, followed by their final group match against Nepal (February 17) in Mumbai.A BCCI source, however, maintained that such a shift is virtually impossible with just a month remaining before the tournament.“You can't just change games at someone's whims and fancies. It is a logistical nightmare. Think about opposition teams. Their air tickets, hotels are booked.“Also on all days there are three games each which means one game is in Sri Lanka. There is broadcast crew. So it will be easier said than done,” the source said.India’s arch-rival Pakistan are already playing their World Cup matches in Sri Lanka as part of an understanding reached months ago.Meanwhile, Indo-Bangladesh relations have deteriorated sharply following the ouster of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India in August last year after anti-government protests.She was later sentenced to death in absentia by a tribunal for her alleged role in a deadly crackdown during the agitation in which several students were killed.While the BCCI did not explicitly cite the prevailing political situation as the reason for seeking Rahman’s release, it indicated that the decision was triggered by recent developments.Hindus have been targeted in violent attacks since Hasina’s ouster.",Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) directed by country's sports ministry to seek a shift of Bangladesh’s T20 World Cup league matches from India to Sri Lanka.

Desert Vipers won:





True to their form across the various T20 leagues, the MI Emirates(MIE) — Mumbai Indians' UAE-based franchise — have had a patchy campaign in the fourth season of the ILT20. They secured two wins in their first five matches before registering five wins on the bounce to secure the playoffs berth. Following a stumble in the first Qualifier, they booked their place in the ILT20 2025-26 final against the Desert Vipers.Meanwhile, the Desert Vipers have been one the most consistent than MIE this season. The now Sam Curran-led franchise started with six consecutive wins, progressing to the playoffs in a jiffy, and maintained that dominance by beating MIE in Qualifier 1.This journey to the final at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium is not a first for either team. MI Emirates triumphed in 2024 while the Vipers have reached the final twice already but fell short on both occasions (2023, 2025).Curran stepped in as captain following a calf injury to New Zealand's Lockie Ferguson, whose T20 World Cup appearance is also under threat. Following two finals lost in three years, the England all-rounder hopes Sunday's final plays out differently.""You take learnings, but it's a new season, completely different players, of course, but the conditions might be slightly different. I guess you take learnings from it, but we've done so many things well this season, so I guess we stick to the process. Last year we lost a close game,"" said Curran on the eve of the final.""I think getting to the final is a huge achievement in itself, and there's one more to go, so let's hope we see how tomorrow goes,"" he continued.""Finals are always different — the pressure, the crowd, the occasion — but that’s what you play for. We’re excited, fully aware of what it demands, and are looking forward to the challenge,” said Curran who has scored 323 runs this season and is the second-highest scorer.MI have tasted success in all the T20 leagues they have a presence in (IPL, SA20, MLC and ILT20) with MIE skipper Kieron Pollard involved in some of them. On Sunday, they will look to increase their tally in the UAE with experience expected to play a key role.""You can say it counts (experience), yes, but again, it's different players at different times, you do it in different parts of the world with different players. It's interesting to understand what is needed to win, so again for us, we have lost a lot of players... for us, I'm just happy that the guys have rallied and gotten to this point,"" said Pollard.""I want them to just enjoy the experience of playing in a final, and whatever happens, happens, you're going to play to win, you're going to do everything you're looking forward to, but just enjoy the experience,"" he continued.Curran, the last year's Red Belt (MVP) winner, is one of the players to watch out for in the final. Equally impressive has been Andries Gous whose unbeaten knock of 120 in the Qualifier kept MIE at bay.For the locals, the focus will be on UAE international Muhammad Waseem, who currently leads both the Green Belt (most runs) and Blue Belt (best UAE player) standings, having amassed 344 runs this season. The UAE opener is also on track to win the Blue Belt for a fourth consecutive time.Pollard had positive things to say for the UAE players who have made themselves count this season: “What we’ve seen from the UAE players over the past few seasons has been outstanding, both for the franchise and for UAE cricket. When you give them opportunities, they show real hunger and deliver when called upon.""Rohid [Muhammad Rohid] was a last-minute call-up, but he was outstanding to pick up two wickets in Qualifier 2. Seeing them step up and perform consistently at this level is encouraging, not just for us as a team, but for the future and the growth of UAE cricket.”","MI Emirates face Desert Vipers in the final of the DP World International League T20 season 4 final in Dubai.

Poll Do you think displaying the Palestinian flag during a cricket match is acceptable? Yes, it's a form of expression. No, it politicizes sports. It depends on the context.





NEW DELHI: The Jammu and Kashmir Police have launched an investigation after a Palestinian flag was spotted during a local cricket match in Jammu, prompting the summoning of a player and the organiser of a privately run tournament for questioning.The incident occurred on Wednesday during a match between JK11 Kings and Jammu Trailblazers in the ongoing Jammu and Kashmir Champions League. Television footage showed a cricketer batting with a helmet bearing the Palestinian flag on its front, an image that quickly circulated on social media and drew the attention of authorities.“One cricket player and organiser of the tournament has been called for questioning by J&K Police regarding the use of the Palestine flag on his helmet during a cricket match at a private tournament in Jammu,” police said in an official statement, according to India Today. The cricketer has been identified as Furqan Bhat, while the tournament organiser is Zahid Bhat.Police officials said they are examining the circumstances under which the flag was displayed and whether any permissions were obtained. Investigators are also checking for violations of tournament guidelines and assessing the intent behind displaying the flag during a sporting event. “Police are verifying the facts and investigating the matter,” a senior official said, adding that no action has been taken so far and any further steps will depend on the outcome of due diligence.The Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) has distanced itself from the event, confirming that the tournament is not recognised by the state body or any national authority. “The league is not recognised by JKCA,” Brig Anil Gupta (Retd), Member Administration of the JKCA, told IANS, noting that the player involved was not registered with the association or its affiliates. BCCI rules prohibit players from participating in unrecognised leagues.Police reportedly rushed to the venue after the image went viral and have also begun probing the unauthorised tournament itself. This is the second privately organised league from Jammu and Kashmir to come under scrutiny in recent months, following the collapse of the Indian Heaven Premier League in Srinagar, where organisers allegedly fled midway, leaving players and officials stranded.","A Palestinian flag was spotted during a local cricket match in Jammu, prompting the summoning of a player and the organiser of a privately run tournament.

MI Emirates booked their place in the ILT20 Season 4 final with a convincing seven-wicket win over Abu Dhabi Knight Riders in Qualifier 2 at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Friday. After restricting the Knight Riders to 120/8, Shakib Al Hasan and Tom Banton sealed the chase to set up a final clash against the Desert Vipers on January 4 at the Dubai International Stadium.Allah Ghazanfar claimed three wickets for 24 runs, while Alishan Sharafu’s unbeaten half-century guided the Knight Riders to a modest total. In response, Banton (62 off 53) and Shakib (38 off 24) stitched together an 82-run partnership off 53 balls, absorbing early pressure to take MI Emirates into their second final across four seasons.MI Emirates made a slow start as Andre Fletcher (5 off 6) fell in the second over, with Ajay Kumar providing the early breakthrough. Jason Holder and Sunil Narine kept the pressure on as Tom Banton and Muhammad Waseem (10 off 14) struggled to rotate the strike, leaving MI Emirates at 26/1 at the end of the powerplay.The pair stabilised the chase thereafter, taking 10 runs off Olly Stone in the seventh over. However, Narine broke their 30-run stand off 35 balls in the following over, trapping Waseem LBW. Shakib then joined Banton and shifted the momentum, striking Liam Livingstone for a six and two fours in a decisive 17-run 12th over.The duo brought up their 50-run partnership in just 29 balls.Banton reached his half-century off 49 balls in the 15th over, hammering four fours off Holder to collect 18 runs. This reduced the equation to just eight runs from the final five overs.

With boundaries hard to come by, the powerplay firmly belonged to the MI Emirates bowlers as the Knight Riders crawled to 31/2.Liam Livingstone’s struggles (4 off 10) ended with a miscue off Rohid in the seventh over. The spinners then tightened the screws, with boundaries scarce barring Arab Gul’s costly 12th over, which went for 13.Alex Hales (29 off 36) and Alishan Sharafu (50 not out off 40) briefly lifted the tempo with a 47-run stand off 44 balls before Ghazanfar dismissed Hales with the final delivery of the 14th over.Ghazanfar returned in the 18th over to claim two wickets in the same over, first removing Jason Holder (1 off 2), who holed out to Kieron Pollard, and then sending Sunil Narine (4 off 3) back to the pavilion. Sharafu brought up his half-century off the final ball of the innings as the Knight Riders laboured to 120/8.Player of the Match Shakib Al Hasan said, “It was a crucial game for us, and winning the toss helped.

Paarl Royals:

MI Cape Town:





Lhuan-dre Pretorius ignited his SA20 Season 4 campaign with a superb unbeaten 98, guiding Paarl Royals to a dramatic one-run win over MI Cape Town in a pulsating Western Cape derby at Boland Park on Friday night.With 15 to defend in the final over, Royals seamer Ottniel Baartman found himself under severe pressure after Kagiso Rabada launched the third ball for a six over long-off. The momentum appeared to have shifted, but Baartman struck back immediately, having Rabada caught on the boundary with the very next delivery.That left MI Cape Town needing six off the final ball. George Linde struck a length delivery sweetly over cover, only for the ball to drop inches short of the rope, triggering wild celebrations among the home supporters.After a quiet start to the season, Pretorius rediscovered his touch at his favourite venue. The teenage opener was back to his attacking best, striking 10 fours and two sixes during a commanding 65-ball innings. Although the Royals crowd urged him towards a maiden T20 hundred, Rabada’s final-ball dot denied him the milestone.MI Cape Town were under pressure from the outset as Pretorius and Asa Tribe dominated the powerplay.The opening pair added exactly 100 in 10.4 overs before captain Rashid Khan (2/31) dismissed Tribe for 51 off 34 balls.The visitors responded strongly with the bat, as Rassie van der Dussen and Ryan Rickelton (36) put on 77 for the first wicket in 7.5 overs. However, new Royals signing Sikandar Raza (3/27) turned the contest, removing Rickelton and Nicholas Pooran before cleaning up Tom Moores with his first delivery.Baartman then delivered the decisive blow, claiming both Van der Dussen (59) and Jason Smith (1) within three balls to derail MI Cape Town’s chase and seal a memorable win for the Royals.181 for 3 in 20 overs (Lhuan-dre Pretorius 98 not out, Asa Tribe 51; Rashid Khan 2/31)180 for 8 in 20 overs (Rassie van der Dussen 59, Ryan Rickelton 36; Ottneil Baartman 4/51, Sikandar Raza 3/27)",Paarl Royals edged MI Cape Town by one run in a gripping SA20 derby.

Just like Virat Kohli ’s recent domestic matches, Indian ODI and Test captain Shubman Gill ’s upcoming Vijay Hazare Trophy game will also be played without fans in the stands.

Why Mohammed Shami needs to return in India colours before World Cup





The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Saturday announced a 15-member squad for the three-match ODI series against New Zealand, starting January 11, with Shubman Gill named captain.Shreyas Iyer has been appointed vice-captain, though his participation will depend on fitness clearance from the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence (COE).Fast bowler Mohammed Siraj has returned to the ODI squad. However, Mohammed Shami has not been selected despite featuring regularly in domestic cricket in recent months, indicating that the selectors may be moving on from the senior pacer.Reacting to Shami’s omission, Bengal head coach Laxmi Ratan Shukla criticised the Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee. Shukla said that Shami had shown more commitment to domestic cricket than any other international player and described the decision as unfair.""The selection committee has done an injustice to Mohammed Shami. No international player has played domestic cricket with as much dedication as Shami in the recent past. Even after toiling hard in domestic cricket, what the selection committee has done with Shami is shameful,"" Shukla said on Saturday (January 3), as quoted by Revsportz.Shami last represented India in the ODI format during the 2025 Champions Trophy, where his performances played a role in India winning the title. He dealt with fitness concerns before and after the tournament but has since returned to action, picking up 11 wickets in five matches at an average of 22.27. On the day the squad was announced, Shami registered figures of 3/55 and also scored an unbeaten 25 against Assam.For the New Zealand series, India have selected four frontline pacers — Mohammed Siraj, Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna and Arshdeep Singh. Siraj did not feature in the previous ODI series against South Africa.","India announce 15-member squad for three-match ODI series against New Zealand.

Masood Uz Zafar Amini, the coach of Indian batter Rinku Singh , has shared his views on the BCCI ’s decision to release Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman from the 2026 Indian Premier League season. Amini said that while opinions may differ, the decision taken by the BCCI must be respected by everyone.His comments came after Kolkata Knight Riders confirmed that Mustafizur Rahman was released from their squad following instructions from the BCCI. The decision was taken amid recent developments and growing criticism from several political and spiritual groups.These groups had questioned KKR and team owner Shah Rukh Khan for signing the Bangladeshi pacer during the IPL auction in Abu Dhabi, especially in the backdrop of reports about attacks on Hindu minorities in Bangladesh.Speaking on the issue, Amini stressed that cricket and religion should not be mixed.""If the BCCI has given permission to change the player, then it can be done. But Mustafizur Rahman is a cricketer first; Hindu or Muslim comes later. Other teams in the IPL had also bid for Mustafizur, so as KKR and they eventually took him in. I would like to say that he is a player first and any religion is later. So whatever is the decision of the BCCI, it has to be accepted,” he told news agency IANS.“There should be no politics with players. Playing and politics are different things. People of every religion live and such incidents keep happening. But this should not be associated with the game. However, it's a decision of the nation and since the BCCI has taken a decision, we have to abide by it,” he further added.Mustafizur Rahman was bought by KKR for Rs 9.2 crore in the December 2025 IPL auction.He has played for several teams over the years. The list includes the likes of Sunrisers Hyderabad, Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Delhi Capitals and Chennai Super Kings.Since making his IPL debut in 2016, the Bangladeshi pacer has taken 65 wickets in 60 matches.","Bangladeshi fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman was released by Kolkata Knight Riders.

India’s top footballers have come together to make an emotional appeal to FIFA, asking the world governing body to step in as the Indian Super League (ISL) remains suspended with no clear return date. The appeal includes senior Indian players like Sunil Chhetri , Gurpreet Singh Sandhu and Sandhesh Jhingan, along with several foreign players who play in the ISL.The players said the continued delay of the 2025–26 ISL season has created deep uncertainty and fear. They warned that Indian football is slowly moving towards a complete standstill if the situation is not resolved soon.""It's January and we should be on your screens as apart of a competitive football game in the Indian Super League,” Gurpreet said in a joint video shared on social media.""Instead, here we are driven by fear and desperation to say aloud something which we all know,"" Jhingan added.In the video, the players said that the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is no longer able to manage the crisis and protect the future of football in the country. They asked FIFA to intervene and help bring stability back to the game.""But more importantly, we are here to make a plea. Indian football governance is no longer able to fulfil its responsibilities. We are now staring at a permanent paralysis. This is the last-ditch effort to save what we can.So we are calling the FIFA to step in and do what it takes to save Indian football,"" the players said.They also made it clear that their message was not political but based on urgent need.""We hope this message gets to the power that are in Zurich. This call is not political, it is not driven by confrontation but by necessity. It might sound like a big word but the truth is that we are facing a humanitarian, sporting and economic crisis. And of course, we need rescuing at the earliest. We just want to play football, please help us do it,” they said.Sunil Chhetri ended the appeal by stressing the impact on everyone involved. ""Players, staff, owners and the fans deserve clarity, protection and more importantly, a future,” he added.The ISL season was put on hold in July due to uncertainty over the renewal of the Master Rights Agreement between the AIFF and Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL). The deal expired in December, leading to legal issues and Supreme Court involvement.

Poll Should Pep Guardiola consider a change in tactics after the frustrating draw? Yes, definitely No, the current tactics will work Only minor adjustments are needed





Manchester City missed the chance to keep pace with Arsenal at the top of the Premier League after being held to a frustrating 0-0 draw by Sunderland on Thursday, as a low-scoring start to 2026 saw three of four New Year’s Day fixtures end without a goal.City now trail league leaders Arsenal by four points after failing to capitalise on the Gunners’ emphatic 4-1 demolition of Aston Villa earlier in the week. Pep Guardiola’s side had won eight straight matches to close out 2025, but were unable to break down a resilient Sunderland team that preserved its unbeaten home record since returning to the top flight.Bernardo Silva thought he had given City an early lead, only for his effort to be ruled out for offside inside the opening six minutes. Despite Sunderland missing six players to the Africa Cup of Nations and centre-back Dan Ballard through injury, the hosts held firm. Goalkeeper Robin Roefs produced a string of fine saves to deny Erling Haaland and Josko Gvardiol, while Savinho blazed over a gilt-edged chance.“It’s a mystery,” Guardiola said. “We created a lot, especially in the second half. We take the point — it’s a long way to go.”Liverpool were also left frustrated after being held to a 0-0 draw by Leeds at Anfield.Reds boss Arne Slot lamented the absence of “individual special moments” as his side struggled without Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak. Leeds thought they had snatched a late winner through Dominic Calvert-Lewin, but his effort was ruled out for a marginal offside, extending their unbeaten run to six games.Tottenham’s attacking woes continued in another goalless draw away to Brentford on Thomas Frank’s return to the club he once guided into the Premier League. Spurs fans vented their frustration late on, chanting “boring, boring Tottenham,” while Frank admitted, “We don’t create enough. We need to keep working on that.”Elsewhere, Crystal Palace’s winless run stretched to six games after a 1-1 draw with Fulham. Jean-Philippe Mateta opened the scoring before Tom Cairney struck a fine equaliser.","Manchester City were held to a frustrating 0-0 draw by Sunderland.

PANAJI: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has given clubs 24 hours to confirm their participation and the preferred format for this season’s Indian Super League (ISL).According to sources, the clubs will respond to AIFF before Thursday’s deadline but at least eight of them will seek additional details pertaining to finances.Without a commercial partner, the toptier clubs are not ready to share added financial burden.“Why should the clubs pay for everything,” asked one official. “The AIFF owns the league but has not yet committed to any financial contribution. The clubs should not solely shoulder the responsibility, particularly at a time when we will not have central revenue share and even sponsorships.”The AIFF’s three-member ISL coordination committee has had five meetings with clubs since last week but there is no confirmation on either the format or whether all 14 of them will take part when the league kicks off next month.“AIFF is required to submit the outcome of these meetings to the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports before Jan 2,” AIFF’s deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan wrote in a letter to club CEOs on Wednesday.The federation has given clubs time till Jan 1 to “confirm participation.”For India to earn an Asian spot, all clubs must play atleast 24 league matches in a season.There’s no time now for a fullfledged league since player contracts, and the season, officially ends May 31.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has given clubs 24 hours to confirm their participation and the preferred format for this season's Indian Super League (ISL) According to sources, the clubs will respond to AIFF before Thursday’s deadline but at least eight of them will seek additional details pertaining to finances.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126282790,imgsize-71846,width-400,resizemode-4/fotball-isl-0101.jpg"

Real Madrid have confirmed that Kylian Mbappe has suffered a sprain to his left knee, dealing a significant setback to their pursuit of La Liga leaders Barcelona. The club issued a statement on Wednesday revealing the diagnosis following medical tests, adding that his condition will be monitored over the coming days.The Spanish giants did not provide a clear timeline for the 27-year-old forward’s return. However, a source close to the France international told AFP that Mbappe is expected to be sidelined for a minimum of three weeks.Mbappe’s injury places his availability in serious doubt for Sunday’s home league fixture against Real Betis, Madrid’s first match after the winter break. Carlo Ancelotti’s side currently sit four points behind Barcelona in the title race. The forward could also miss the Spanish Super Cup semi-final against Atletico Madrid in Saudi Arabia on January 8, along with a league encounter against Levante and a Champions League meeting with his former club Monaco.Real Madrid have not disclosed when or how the injury occurred. Mbappe was involved in full training with the squad on Tuesday before undergoing an MRI scan the following day.The setback comes after an exceptional year for Mbappe. In 2025, he matched Cristiano Ronaldo ’s club record of 59 goals in a calendar year and has often been the driving force behind Madrid’s performances, easing pressure on head coach Xabi Alonso.Since arriving on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain 18 months ago, Mbappe has scored 73 goals in 83 appearances for the club.He finished last season as La Liga’s leading scorer with 31 goals, four more than Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski . This campaign, he already has 18 league goals and holds a seven-goal advantage over Barcelona’s Ferran Torres.Mbappe’s absence further compounds Real Madrid’s injury concerns.

RAW TALENTFancy a swig of raw milk? Good for your gut, and legs it seems. Head too. It’s superfood, just ask Super Haaland. He loves to visit a Cheshire farm to get his locally sourced bottles. And as you know, he rarely bottles up in front of goal – scoring 25 times in his 23 matches for City so far.

PSG’s success story in 2025 is one to behold -- How Luis Enrique rebooted the continent’s nearly men into European champions with discipline, teamwork, tactics, belief while deleting the individualist approach.All for one and one for all, Luis’ musketeers reeled in trophy after trophy but there was one battle PSG lost, to former talisman Kylian Mbappe, in the boardroom and the courtroom. In this sabre fencing, Paris employed the slashing technique, cutting off the Frenchman’s salary that included a so-called ‘ethics bonus’. Mad in Madrid, Mbappe’s riposte was of the legal kind. After the back and forth, the court ruled that the former employers pay up unpaid wages of 60m euros. Back in Spain, Mbappe earned some Real love from the Bernabeu faithful, after scoring 59 goals in 59 games, equaling his ‘hero’ Cristiano Ronaldo’s record, the most in a calendar year. How did he celebrate it? Siuuuuu…NO FAN’S LANDThe Big Leagues’ global expansion was put on hold. La Liga president Javier Tebas’ plan to ‘host’ a league match between Barcelona and Villarreal in Miami 7,500-km away from the shores of Spain was cancelled. The league had also chartered planes to take around 2,000 to 3,000 Villarreal fans to the US of A. In Oct, there were league-wide protests, stopping active play to express displeasure. Ultimately, Tebas had to bow down as organisers pulled out. Last week, a high-profile plan to stage a Serie A match -- AC Milan vs. Como -- in Perth was scrapped.DIAMONDS ARE FOREVEROne of the most viral pics of 2025 was of Georgina Rodriguez’s oversized diamond engagement ring reported to be valued between $2 and 5m, the kind of flashy display that one can associate with her fiancé Cristiano Ronaldo.

Salah won it that day, and the tears flowed.Since then, fortunes have taken a different turn for both Liverpool and Mo. After promising and delivering a record-equalling 20th league title in April, ‘the Egyptian king’ found himself on the sidelines, and an outburst against club and gaffer, left him on the brink of an exit as he proceeded to AFCON duty with his legacy under threat and a question mark over his return.In Spain, close on the heels of a successful Euro campaign, Lamine Yamal finds himself ostracized -- from ‘wonderkid’ to ‘bad loser’, with his moves scrutinized in public by a damning jealous social media.

Ryan Rickelton press conference: 'Been tough last couple of months mentally in India'

Florian Wirtz's first Liverpool goal fired the Reds into the Premier League 's top four despite an unconvincing 2-1 win over Wolves on a day both clubs paid tribute to Diogo Jota . Jota, who was killed in a car accident alongside his brother Andre Silva in July, won four trophies after joining Liverpool from Wolves in 2020.Two of his children led the teams out as mascots, while his wife Rute Cardoso watched on from the sidelines.Both sets of fans sang chants in Jota's name in the 18th and 20th minutes -- the shirt numbers he wore during his spells at Molineux and Anfield respectively.""After the tragedy happened until now, I have seen so many special moments -- where the fans remembered him or our players conducted themselves unbelievably in the circumstances,"" said Liverpool boss Arne Slot.""Not only our fans but the fans of away teams have shown the respect both Diogo and his brother deserved. It was special to see his children being the mascot and how emotional it was before the game and then in the 20th minute.""On the field, both clubs have suffered this season with Wolves staring down the barrel of relegation after taking just two points from their opening 18 league games.Liverpool's form has improved of late and Wirtz is beginning to show flashes of the brilliance that lured the English champions into paying Bayer Leverkusen £100 million ($135 million) for the German international.The 22-year-old registered his first Premier League assist last weekend for a goal that came at some cost to Liverpool as Alexander Isak suffered a broken leg in opening the scoring against Tottenham.Shorn of the most expensive player in English football history for the coming months, there is even more pressure on Wirtz to deliver on his hefty price tag.""He's been very important for us throughout the season. But in football it is about results, you are mainly judged on results or on goals and assists,"" added Slot.""I think today he showed much more than just the goal he scored; he was special for us in many parts of the game.""Wirtz finally opened his account in his 23rd Liverpool appearance by prodding home Hugo Ekitike's pass to double the home side's lead.Just 90 seconds earlier, Liverpool had made the breakthrough when Ryan Gravenberch slammed in Jeremie Frimpong's cross.Yet, even with a 2-0 half-time lead against a side on course to become the worst in Premier League history, Slot could not relax.Santiago Bueno exposed Liverpool's frailty from set-pieces to pull a goal back just six minutes into the second half.Slot's men have made a habit of late collapses at Leeds and Tottenham in recent weeks and needed a perfectly-timed tackle from Conor Bradley to deny Jhon Arias a late equaliser.","Liverpool beat Wolves 2-1 in Premier League.

This year, most scrambled to check the Google Maps to find Curacao when the smallest-ever nation, in terms of population and size, qualified for next year’s mammoth World Cup 2026. With 155,000 inhabitants, the Caribbean island was guided to the top tier by Dick Advocaat, the former Rangers and PSV boss who has also worked with eight national teams including his native Netherlands (1992-94).Sebastian Migne never set foot on Haiti, another Caribbean nation, because international flights do not land there. They played all their World Cup home qualifiers in Curacao, some 500 miles across the sea.These football stories are the brightest beacon of 2025. In contrast, the darkness around Indian football seems to have grown deeper, unfathomable, with no light at the end of the tunnel.The year gone by has seen All India Football Federation officials spend more time making rounds of the courts than the national team spent on the field.It might delight a research scholar to know that AIFF has presented itself to the Supreme Court 16 times and counting.The national team has played only 12 matches. None of it, though, will bring cheer to the fans.Never since Independence has Indian football slipped into such a deep abyss. For the first time since 1996, when the national league was begun by then-AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, it has stalled.One can say with a heavy heart that the league is an orphan now.The sponsorship ran out. The new occupants of Football House, who took charge in 2022, were aware of the matter. But the negotiations just refused to yield any money, assurance, or hope.Since 2010, the AIFF received Rs 50 crore every year from Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), a Reliance Industries subsidiary, as part of an agreement. The 15-year contract ran out on Dec 8.It was obvious to all, except those in Football House, that no one wants to waste money to keep Indian football – once called a sleeping giant by Sepp Blatter just over a decade and a half ago – alive and awake.Till reports last came in, the AIFF plans to start the elite league around Feb 7-8 after presenting a 20-year plan to the ISL clubs. In accordance with the constitution, the league will be owned and operated by the AIFF and will “implement the principles of promotion and relegation.”“I am convinced we can start the league and then work out a long-term solution,” said IFA secy Anirban Dutta, a member of the committee to resolve the ISL crisis.All year, the stakeholders went into hair-splitting debates and nuanced offerings but the outcome, sadly, has been zero. Even a few clubs had temporarily stopped paying salaries to the players. There has been a frustrating sense of ennui.Last heard, there was some warmth shown by the beleaguered clubs towards the AIFF’s proposals. The format for a truncated league is expected to be confirmed in the year’s final week.Add to it the dismal performance of the national team. Hours after India lost to Bangladesh in their last Asian Cup qualification engagement, Haiti’s ticket to the World Cup sent euphoric shock waves around the world. To watch India’s matches this year, under coaches Manolo Marquez and Khalid Jamil, was like visiting the dentist with a severe toothache.The Indian senior men’s team failed to qualify for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup, which means no competitive football until at least Nov 2027. That is nearly three years without meaningful matches. One wonders what will be Khalid Jamil’s work schedule now?One question keeps haunting, though. If Curacao are able to hire the services of a world-renowned coach like Advocaat, why could India, claimed to be the fourth-largest economy in the world, never reach beyond the Manolos and the Stimacs and the Koevermans? One can keep waiting for an answer but there will only be silence from the All India Football Federation.Following some creditable performances against Bahrain (2-0) and Brunei (6-0), U-23 coach Naushad Moosa got stuck in Doha. Not one to be easily perturbed, even by the sudden bombing of the Qatari capital, Moosa showered rousing praise on the boys. But his enthusiasm was laced with bleakness.“What’s next for the boys? They will go back to their clubs and warm the bench. They won’t be getting any minutes,” he had said in Sept. With the U-17s, Bibiano Fernandes also made headlines by helping the boys cross the Asian Cup qualification hurdles.Repeating himself, Moosa confirmed his apprehensions in Dec. “Nothing is happening. The players too are sadly cooling their heels.” And we couldn’t but recall the days not too long ago, when the AIFF had to put a cap of 45 matches on the national team players.One may point out that these are silver linings. If so, then why can’t Manolo or Jamil do without Sunil Chhetri , India’s weather-beaten warhorse who is past 40? The striker had to break his retirement vows and don the India shirt again, confirming that Indian football’s cupboard is starkly bare.The year 2025 will stay in memory as the lowest point in Indian football.LEAGUE UNCERTAINTY: It’s the end of December, half-time in most football seasons, a time when clubs redraw their strategies, depending on the progress they’ve made in the league. This year, nothing. Indian football has never seen anything like this. There’s no word on the top tier ISL or the I-League, because the AIFF has simply failed to find a commercial partner. Everything’s at a standstill: clubs have paused first team operations, players have stopped training and many foreigners plan to move elsewhere once the transfer window opens on Jan 1. One club has told players they will have to “forego salaries” for months and they’d be “happy to resume payments” only from the date of restart.CAMPS WITHOUT PLAYERS: National team camps often kicked off without half the players. Coach Khalid Jamil wanted more time with the boys, but clubs refused to release players outside the FIFA international windows. It was no different for U-23 assignments. The trust deficit between the two parties has grown so much that Mohun Bagan SG, who have the maximum players at national camps, even accused the federation of negligence over the handling of their captain Subhashish Bose.MONUMENTAL FAILURE: In the 15 months between May 2024 and August 2025, the national team had three coaches — Igor Stimac, Manolo Marquez, Khalid Jamil — none of whom could ensure that India makes it to the AFC Asian Cup, the country’s first failure since the tournament was expanded to accommodate 24 teams. In the final round of qualifiers, India were the highest-ranked side but finished at the bottom, unable to register a single win and in five matches, scoring just twice. The defeat to Bangladesh in Dhaka, the first in 22 years, rankled the most.THE BIG EXIT: The City Football Group’s exit from Mumbai City FC was probably the biggest reflection of the mess that is Indian football. CFG, the world’s leading private owner and operator of 13 clubs, including Manchester City, had joined hands with Mumbai City with much fanfare. Their decision to divest its shareholding in the club is a huge blow. The reason: “CFG made this decision following a comprehensive commercial review and in light of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the future of the Indian Super League (ISL). ”BUT, A SILVER LINING: The women’s team provided joy in an otherwise grim state. The senior team defied the odds to defeat World Cuppers Thailand and qualify for the AFC Asian Cup. The U-17 and U-20 teams also left India with three continental competitions to play for in the opening months of 2026. At club level, East Bengal’s SAFF Club Championship triumph and a first group stage win in the AFC Women’s Champions League brought cheer.UNDER MANOLO MARQUEZUNDER KHALID JAMILIndia won Bronze Medal at CAFA Nations CupTOTAL MATCHES: 11India Won: 3India Lost: 5Drawn: 3Goals Scored: 8Goals Conceded: 12","Indian football has slipped into such a deep abyss.

Rayan Cherki steals the show as Manchester City edge Nottingham Forest to go top of the Premier League,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/rayan-cherki-steals-the-show-as-manchester-city-edge-nottingham-forest-to-go-top-of-the-premier-league/articleshow/126206283.cms,"Manchester City's Rayan Cherki celebrates with Erling Haaland (Barrington Coombs/PA via AP)

Rayan Cherki delivered another decisive statement of his growing influence at Manchester City as his late strike secured a 2-1 Premier League win over Nottingham Forest and lifted Pep Guardiola’s side to the top of the table on Saturday.The France international was at the heart of everything City did well at the City Ground. After setting up Tijjani Reijnders for the opening goal early in the second half, Cherki returned in the closing stages to fire home the winner, capping a standout display that underlined his importance to City’s title push.City had to weather sustained pressure from Forest, who matched Guardiola’s men for large spells and were level soon after falling behind. Omari Hutchinson, scoring his first goal for the club, punished a rare City mistake to bring the home side back into the contest and briefly threaten another memorable result against the champions.Guardiola’s team eventually found a way through, extending their winning run to eight matches in all competitions and six straight league victories. The result moved City one point clear of Arsenal, although the Gunners could reclaim top spot later in the day with a home win over Brighton.Before kick-off, Forest paid tribute to club legend John Robertson, who passed away on Christmas Day at the age of 72. The former Scotland winger was a central figure in Forest’s back-to-back European Cup triumphs in 1979 and 1980, and his flair and end product were fondly remembered by the City Ground crowd.Cherki, who joined City from Lyon in the summer, appears to share that same blend of creativity and cutting edge. At just 22, he has quickly become a key figure in Guardiola’s side and, should City edge Arsenal to the title, his contribution is likely to be pivotal.Guardiola had set a stern tone over the festive period, warning his players against excess and making it clear that fitness standards would not be compromised. He even cancelled a planned rest day after last weekend’s win over West Ham. When asked about his squad’s condition, Guardiola joked that he was the only one who had put on weight.Despite that discipline, City looked flat before the break and Forest had the better chances. Morgan Gibbs-White went close after meeting a Callum Hudson-Odoi cross, while City struggled to impose themselves. Erling Haaland, who has 19 league goals by Christmas, the joint-most at this stage in Premier League history, was largely kept quiet.The visitors finally found their rhythm just after the interval. Cherki drifted inside and slipped a clever pass to Reijnders, who finished calmly from 12 yards for City’s first shot on target. Cherki then tested goalkeeper John Victor with a fierce effort moments later.Forest responded swiftly.

Why didn’t the Denver Broncos draft Josh Allen in 2018? John Elway finally explains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-didnt-the-denver-broncos-draft-josh-allen-in-2018-john-elway-finally-explains/articleshow/126329851.cms,"Why didn’t the Denver Broncos draft Josh Allen in 2018? John Elway finally explains (Image Via Getty)

John Elway explains why the Broncos passed on Josh Allen in the 2018 draft





John Elway has revealed he once wanted to draft Josh Allen for the Denver Broncos, but the move never happened. Speaking recently, Elway said he liked Allen during the 2018 NFL Draft process but failed to get full support from his coaching staff. Nearly eight years later, Allen is now one of the NFL’s top quarterbacks, while Denver is still reflecting on that missed chance.The admission came as Allen continues to shine with the Buffalo Bills. Elway’s comments have sparked fresh debate among Broncos fans about how different the franchise’s path could have been if Allen had landed in Denver.John Elway shared the story on Club Shay Shay with former Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe. He explained that while he strongly liked Josh Allen, he believed in making draft decisions with full agreement from the coaching staff.“I really liked him,” Elway said. “But I couldn’t get the buy-in from the coaching staff. I couldn’t get everyone on the same page.” At the time, Denver’s head coach was Vance Joseph.Elway added that Allen was not a finished product coming out of college. “He was very raw. Accuracy was the big question,” he said.“But he was big, strong, athletic, and competitive.” Elway admitted he now regrets not overruling the staff. “I wish I had just taken him and said, ‘Now it’s up to you to make him great,’” he said.In the 2018 NFL Draft, the Broncos held the fifth overall pick but chose Bradley Chubb instead. Josh Allen was selected two picks later by Buffalo at No. 7. Chubb played four seasons in Denver before being traded to the Miami Dolphins.Since then, the Bills have reached the playoffs every season with Allen and made the AFC Championship Game twice.Denver, by contrast, has made only one playoff appearance during that stretch. Elway stepped down as Broncos general manager in 2021 and later moved into a consultant role.This season, Denver has bounced back under head coach Sean Payton, posting a 13–3 record and leading the AFC West. Buffalo also remains a strong contender in the AFC, with Allen once again at the center of their success.Also Read: Tom Brady Fans Flood The Comments Section Of Alix Earle's Instagram Post After Pair's Close Display At NYE Party",John Elway has revealed he wanted to draft Josh Allen in the 2018 NFL Draft.

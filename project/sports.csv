India XI:

Leading the three-match series 1-0, Australia won the toss and decided to field in the second ODI against India at the Adelaide Oval on Thursday. Australia had won the series opener by 7 wickets, with 29 balls remaining, under the DLS method in a rain-affected contest in Perth.The Indian lineup is once again without Kuldeep Yadav, who had been India's best bowler during the last two series - Asia Cup and West Indies Tests.Shubman Gill-led India will look to produce a better show with the bat after producing just 136 runs in the first ODI with the top order faltering. Rohit Sharma (8), Shubman Gill (10), Virat Kohli (0), Shreyas Iyer (11) all failed to fire as India reached 45/4 on the day.Towards that effort and to level the series, India have named an unchanged outfit. ""Looks like a good surface. We would have bowled as well as the pitch has been under cover for a couple of days. We're expecting a little bit initially but happy to bat first. Hopefully the weather is good today and no stoppages. We're going with the same team,"" said Gill at the toss.In Kuldeep's absence, India's spin bowling duties will be helmed by Axar Patel and Washington Sundar while the seam bowling responsibilities rest on Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana.Nitish Kumar Reddy can also chip in for a few bowlers.Australia have made three changes from the playing XI that won in Perth. Alex Carey, Xavier Bartlett and Adam Zampa have come in at the expense of Josh Philippe, Nathan Ellis and Matthew Kuhnemann.""The weather played havoc in Perth but the way we stuck at it was really pleasing in. The pitch is great here. Hopefully a big crowd. An awesome opportunity to win the series,"" said Australia captain Mitchell Marsh as the coin came on his side.Mitchell Marsh(c), Travis Head, Matthew Short, Matt Renshaw, Alex Carey(w), Cooper Connolly, Mitchell Owen, Xavier Bartlett, Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa, Josh HazlewoodRohit Sharma, Shubman Gill(c), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul(w), Washington Sundar, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammed Siraj","Australia won the toss and decided to field against India in the second ODI at the Adelaide Oval.

Why Mohammad Rizwan was not out despite hitting the stumps on the last ball - Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/why-mohammad-rizwan-was-not-out-despite-hitting-the-stumps-on-the-last-ball-explained/articleshow/124750590.cms,"Pakistan's Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan walk off the field on the end of the play of third day of the second test cricket match between Pakistan and South Africa (AP Photo/Anjum Naveed)

Day three in Rawalpindi was filled with drama, but one moment at the very end drew attention for its unusual circumstances. On the final delivery, South Africa had dominated proceedings, and Pakistan ’s Mohammad Rizwan drove a ball from Keshav Maharaj toward cover. With no run attempted, Rizwan casually turned and, in a smooth motion, tapped the base stump with his bat, dislodging the bails.South Africa wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne immediately appealed for hit wicket, convinced Rizwan had broken his stumps. However, the ball was technically still in play—the fielder collecting the shot had not yet returned it to the keeper, and the umpires had not called stumps.Umpire Sharfuddoula at the bowler’s end quickly dismissed the appeal with a smile, supported by square-leg umpire Chris Brown. Reports indicate the South African players were not directly told why the appeal was rejected.While it is unusual for a batter to remove bails with their bat, the Laws of Cricket support Rizwan’s action. Law 35.1 specifies that a batter can only be out hit wicket during the bowler’s delivery stride, while attempting a shot or taking a run immediately afterward, or while making a second or further stroke to guard the wicket. Rizwan’s action did not meet any of these conditions.South Africa appeared to take the incident in stride. Allrounder Senuran Muthusamy later admitted he was too far from the play to notice exactly what happened, suggesting the team was not particularly aggrieved.By stumps, Pakistan held a narrow 23-run lead with six wickets remaining, keeping South Africa’s hopes of leveling the series alive.",Mohammad Rizwan dislodges bails with his bat on final delivery of day three.

The clock is ticking for Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli in India’s must-win Adelaide ODI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-australia/the-clock-is-ticking-for-rohit-sharma-and-virat-kohli-in-indias-must-win-adelaide-odi/articleshow/124751014.cms,"Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli (ANI)

Reddy, Kuldeep Conundrum

Rain has been a bit of a bother for India in Australia so far. In the first game in Perth, their innings was affected by constant stoppages that didn’t allow the batters to generate any momentum. And now in Adelaide, on the eve of their second game, the optional practice session was disturbed by showers.Still, Rohit Sharma turned up — he knows the clock is ticking for him. In the first game, he got out for eight, and with Yashasvi Jaiswal made to sit out, the former captain knows another failure will start all sorts of conversations. The visuals from the training sessions suggested he trained in earnest, and batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said Rohit, along with Virat Kohli , have looked pretty good in training so far.“They are senior players. They have been batting well in the nets. Don’t think there’s any cause of worry about their form,” Kotak said.While the batting form of ‘Ro-Ko’ is the central topic of this ODI series — chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar has arrived in Adelaide, along with fellow selector Shiv Sundar Das, to keep an eye on the situation — India also face a must-win situation at Adelaide Oval. It’s a happy-hunting ground for the team, a venue where they haven’t lost an ODI for the last 17 years.The pitch, the dimensions — everything historically helps the Men in Blue, who have won nine games and lost only five here.But the current Indian team, even as it is trying to figure out its best batting combination, is a little short on bowling as well. Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya are not there, which affects the balance of this attack severely. While Bumrah lends cutting edge to the pace attack, Hardik’s bowling allows India to play Kuldeep Yadav as the third spinner, along with Axar Patel and Washington Sundar.In Hardik’s absence, it’s Nitish Reddy who is filling the allrounder’s slot, but the team management couldn’t show the confidence to use him as the third pacer in Perth.“Any team would feel the absence of Hardik, but that gives us the chance to see if Reddy can come up with the goods,” Kotak said. But it meant that there was no place for Kuldeep, who has been India’s stand-out spinner across formats whenever he has got the chance. The left-arm wristspinner’s non-inclusion in the XI has also been one of the talking points, with former India offie R Ashwin saying on his podcast that it can affect Kuldeep’s confidence.“If you don’t get selected in the XI despite giving the results, you start doubting yourself. The question pops up in your mind, ‘Am I pulling the team down?’” Ashwin said, drawing from his own example when he had to sit out Test matches in SENA countries.But Kotak insisted that it has nothing to do with Kuldeep’s skill-set. It’s only about the team combination and prevailing conditions, which sometimes keeps the wristspinner out.“We take a call as per the ground conditions and the required team combination. Whether at No. 8 we need an allrounder or whether it is important to have a batting cover, that’s something we need to discuss,” Kotak said, indicating that three specialist pacers will play.If that’s the case, it will be interesting to see if Prasidh Krishna gets the nod ahead of Harshit Rana, who didn’t look too impressive in the first game. Prasidh sometimes lacks a bit of control, but he has the ability to churn out the magic ball.But for all that to happen, the weather needs to hold. For now, it looks all clear on Thursday, and the Indian team would dearly want it to stay that way.","Rain has been a bit of a bother for India in Australia so far.

How India can qualify for the next stage?

Three teams - Australia, England and South Africa - have secured their spots in the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup semi-finals, while India, New Zealand, and Sri Lanka remain in contention for the final vacant position. The upcoming match between India and New Zealand will be crucial in determining which team advances to the knockout stages.India are currently on 4 points with a net run rate of +0.526, while New Zealand also have 4 points with a -0.245 net run rate. Sri Lanka, too, are on 4 points with a -1.035 net run rate.India can guarantee themselves a spot in the semi-final spot by winning both their remaining matches against New Zealand and Bangladesh. A victory over New Zealand alone would also be sufficient for India to advance, even if they lose their final game.The tournament's playing conditions specify clear guidelines for determining team rankings when points are equal:""In the event of teams finishing on equal points in the league stage, the ordering of teams will be decided in the following order of priority: The team with the greatest number of wins in the league matches will be placed in the higher position.If there are teams with equal points and equal wins in the league matches, then in such case the teams will be ordered according to their net run rate (NRR) in the league matches. If two or more teams are still equal, they will be ordered according to the result of the head-to-head match played between them.""If the above does not resolve the league ordering, or if all matches within the league stage produce no results, the teams will be ordered as per their original league seedings.""If India lose to New Zealand but defeat Bangladesh, they will need England to beat New Zealand in the final league stage match to advance. Two losses would eliminate India from semi-final contention.New Zealand's path to the semi-finals requires them to win both their remaining matches against India and England. If they defeat India but lose to England, they will need Bangladesh to beat India and maintain a higher net run rate than Sri Lanka, or Pakistan to defeat Sri Lanka.Sri Lanka's semi-final hopes depend on defeating Pakistan in their final group match. They also need India to lose both their remaining matches, New Zealand to lose against England, and their net run rate to surpass New Zealand's.","Three teams - Australia, England and South Africa - have secured their spots in the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup semi-finals.

Former Punjab junior grade cricketer Nikhil Chaudhary admits the best decision he ever made in his life was staying back in Australia once the COVID restrictions were lifted.""It was all God's plan,"" Chaudhary tells TimesofIndia.com from Brisbane.""I have no regrets in saying that staying back in Australia changed my life, my cricket. If I had been in India, my cricket career would have been a mess. You know how it works. Talent and performance don't matter - you need strong recommendations to play cricket,"" he laughs.The 29-year-old has now moved on from the heartaches he suffered during his playing days for Punjab in India's domestic cricket.Chaudhary came through Punjab's age-group system. He represented Punjab in U-16, U-19, and U-23, and even got a few opportunities for Punjab in the limited-overs format. He made it to the Ranji Trophy team but never got the chance to play First Class cricket.The first taste of First Class cricket he got was in his adopted country — Australia.Earlier this month, left-arm spinner Matthew Kuhnemann was picked for Australia to play against New Zealand. Subsequently, the door opened for Nikhil, who had not played red-ball cricket for two years.""Two days before our match against Queensland, I got a call from the Tasmania selectors that I was picked for the Sheffield Shield.I was not expecting this because I hadn't played red-ball cricket for almost two years. In club games, I was only focusing on my white-ball game,"" he recollects.""There were a few eyebrows raised. Some were happy, some weren’t. There were a few nerves. Matthew Wade came to my rescue, and after I was handed the debut cap, he told me, 'Play the way you play in limited overs.'""The words of assurance eased Chaudhary, but it wasn’t enough. In the first innings, he scored 14 off 29 balls.""It isn’t my game. I can’t hold the fort. And then, with the ball in hand, I was bowling slow, trying to give the ball more air, which again is not my strength. I bowl quick leg-breaks,"" he says.This time Tasmania's bowling coach James Hopes came in with a proverbial arm around his shoulder. ""He asked me to bowl quick. It worked, and I picked up a fifer on my debut,"" Chaudhary says.There was still one more twist left. On the final day, he was down with a high fever, and Tasmania were on their knees with Queensland looking for an innings win. At the tea break on Day 4, the coaches asked Nikhil to take rest and instructed No. 9, 10, and 11 to pad up.Chaudhary, who was slotted to bat at No. 8, was going through all the emotions. He started thinking about the time when he was stuck in Australia during Covid, the odd jobs he did to survive, the cricket he played in Brisbane to keep the fire alive in him, the Big Bash League (BBL) contract — and now he had the chance to repay the faith shown in him by Tasmania cricket.""I took pills and told everyone that I could still save this match. I walked out and played my natural game, remained unbeaten on 76 off 80 balls, and we eked out a draw,"" Chaudhary says.""The icing on the cake was that chief selector George Bailey was watching the game as well.""Despite his heroics, he wasn’t sure whether he would be picked for the next match or not because Matthew Kuhnemann was coming back.""He is an Australian cricketer, and you have to make way for the international guys. There is no harm in it. I was just glad to make my First Class debut,"" he says.But Kuhnemann, who is also known as Australia's 'Jaddu' (Ravindra Jadeja), got picked for the three-match white-ball series against India, and Nikhil got another chance. Chaudhary had a sombre outing against Western Australia but experienced one of the most riveting First Class matches in recent times as Tasmania won by just three runs.Chaudhary burst onto the scene after he smoked Pakistan speedster Haris Rauf for a six over backward point and celebrated with a thigh-five after taking wickets for Hobart Hurricanes in the BBL. He then did well in the Dean Jones Cup (List A), before making his First Class debut.It may appear that everything happened pretty quickly, but for this, he has toiled hard.""Once I decided to stay back, I had to work somewhere. I got this job of chopping veggies in a Mexican restaurant. I called up my mother for help. I had never cut a slice of lemon in my life. And as my mother predicted, I ended up cutting my fingers. The folks at the restaurant understood my struggle, and then I was given a big knife and asked to chop meat,"" he says.""One job was not enough. I worked for the Australian Post, where I was delivering parcels door to door. Then drove Uber also for a while, before I got the BBL contract,"" he adds.Making ends meet was difficult, but adapting to the bouncy pitches of Brisbane was even more difficult for Nikhil.""I had played my cricket in Ludhiana and then across India with the Punjab age-group teams. In India, you play on the front foot — that is embedded in your muscle memory. It's easy hitting on the up, but here the ball used to whistle past. As a leg-spinner, I was doing well, picking heaps of wickets in the club games, but I needed to sort my batting.""So, in 2023, I started working on my footwork. From July to September, I hired a professional sidearm and trained thrice a week for three hours indoors. It enhanced my game,"" he says.In the Punjab circuit, Chaudhary was famous for his big-hitting prowess and his ability to crank it up with the ball. But once he moved to Australia, he switched to leg-spin.""I used to bowl leg-spin in the Punjab nets as well. You can ask Anmol Malhotra (Punjab's wicketkeeper). He used to hate facing me (Malhotra agrees to this). I switched to leg-spin to keep my workload intact. I was getting results also,"" he says.Everything was sorted, but Chaudhary was not done. He was enamoured by the athleticism of Australian cricketers. He reached out to Marco Mastrorocco, the Director of Athletic Development at Athletix in Brisbane.""They are massive but still so quick. All these boys grew up playing rugby. Even after having professional cricket contracts, they train like rugby players. I also started training with Marco, and in six months, I witnessed changes in myself. I am quicker while chasing the ball or running between the wickets,"" he says.Nikhil still has an unfulfilled dream -- to play international cricket -- and he believes that in 18 months' time, he will wear that yellow and gold.""Wo bhi hoga paaji (That will also happen). One tick box at a time,"" he signs off.",Former Punjab junior grade cricketer Nikhil Chaudhary now plays for Tasmania in Australia's Sheffield Shield.

Indian cricket stars spread Diwali cheer: Kohli, Gill & Bumrah’s festive wishes

Respite for Rahane

Mumbai: Two Mumbai cricketers on either side of the spectrum went through contrasting fortunes as the national selectors, led by former India pacer Ajit Agarkar, on Tuesday announced the 15-man India A squads for the two four-day matches against South Africa A at the at the BCCI Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru. The first match will be played from Oct 30-Nov 2, the second game will be played from Nov 6 to 9.While seasoned batter Sarfaraz Khan was ignored from the squad, despite having scored 92 against the England Lions in Canterbury and 100 not out against India (the attack included Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep) in an intra-squad match during India A 's tour of England this summer, 18-year-old Ayush Mhatre was fast-tracked into the India A squad for the first match of the series despite an ordinary tour while captaining the India Under-19 team on their recent tour of Australia.A prolific domestic batter, Sarfaraz averages 65.19 in 56 matches in first-class cricket . Sarfaraz averages 117.47 in first-class cricket over the last five years, with five fifties and 10 hundreds, amassing 2, 467 runs in this period. In a bid to answer those who criticised his fitness, the 27-year-old reduced as much as 17 kg of weight earlier this year, scored runs against England (averaged 50 in three Tests) and New Zealand (slammed 150 in the first Test at Bengaluru) in the 2024-25 home Test season.The doors to the Indian team have been firmly closed on him ever since he didn't get to play a single Test in Australia during the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Returning from a quadriceps injury which forced him to miss the Duleep Trophy and Irani Cup, the Mumbaikar scored 42 & 32, and looked in good rhythm according to those who were present at the venue.Justifying Sarfaraz’s surprising exclusion from the India A red-ball team, a source in the BCCI told TOI, “It’s not correct that he's not even in the scheme of things for the Indian Test team or the doors have been closed on him. He’s a talented player. The reality is that the selectors want to ensure that Sarfaraz gets to play as many matches in the Ranji Trophy as possible after his return from injury. He would’ve missed the next few rounds of the Ranji Trophy had he been included in this side. There was a thought to include him in the side for the second match, but then all the India players, like KJL Rahul are keen to play in that game to gain match practice ahead of the home two-Test series against South Africa.”Meanwhile, Mhatre, a talented teenaged opener, managed to score just 38 runs @ 12.66 in the two test matches against the Australia Under-19 team, and 10 runs in three matches @ 3.33 in the Youth OD series prior to that.Appearing a bit surprised at his son's inclusion in the India A squad for the first time, Ayush's father Yogesh Mhatre told TOI, ""It's a surprise Diwali gift for us. It's a golden opportunity for him. This season isn't going great for him, but he's still been given a good platform to perform. I must salute the selectors' thinking behind investing in him.""""Ayush wasn't scoring runs in Australia, but was happy that India won all the matches on that tour. The players were also happy with his captaincy,"" Yogesh revealed.In Aug, Mhatre, who put an impressive show for the Chennai Super Kings in his debut season in IPL-25, had captained Mumbai in the Buchi Babu Tournament, a pre-season event. The Virar lad had done well for India in the Youth test series in England in July, scoring 102 & 32 in the first test at Beckenham & 80 & 126 off 80 balls at Chelmsford against the England Under-19s.Since his first-class debut in Oct last year, Mhatre has amassed 504 runs in nine matches, including two centuries and a fifty. In seven List A games, he has already scored 458 runs, with two hundreds to his name.Meanwhile, the national selectors ignored left-arm spinning allrounder Shams Mulani, who took seven for 46 and scored 91 to star in Mumbai's thrilling 35-run win over Jammu & Kashmir Mumbai in the opening round of the Ranji Trophy at Srinagar a few days back.Meanwhile, veteran batsman Ajinkya Rahane, under pressure after scoring just 27 & 0 in the first match of the 2025-26 season of the Ranji Trophy, was offered a respite as the Mumbai selectors chose to retain the squad for the second match, against Chhattisgarh at the Mumbai Cricket Association's ground in BKC from Oct 25. Mumbai will, however, have to name a replacement for Mhatre, who will be busy with India A duty.",The 15-man India A squads for the two four-day matches against South Africa A were announced on Tuesday.

Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill struggle as India falter in first ODI vs Australia

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma ’s much-anticipated return to India colours didn’t go as planned in Perth, but a strong comeback in the second ODI against Australia at Adelaide on Thursday, October 23, could reignite excitement among fans.Adelaide Oval has historically been a fortress for Kohli.In ODIs at this venue, he has scored 244 runs in four matches at an impressive average of 61, including two centuries.His Test record at the ground is even more remarkable, with 537 runs in five matches at an average of 53.70, featuring three centuries.Combined across formats—including ODIs, Tests, and T20Is—Kohli has played 12 matches at Adelaide, scoring 975 runs at an average of 65, with five centuries and a highest score of 141, along with 10 catches.Rohit, on the other hand, has had a modest record at Adelaide.Across six ODIs, he has scored 131 runs at an average of 21.83, with a highest score of 43. Despite this, his experience and match-winning potential make him a key figure in India’s batting line-up.Returning to international cricket after seven months, both stalwarts struggled in the series opener at Perth.Rohit was dismissed for 8 runs, while Kohli lasted just eight balls before being sent back to the pavilion for a duck.India cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar believes the Perth flop should not be overemphasised.“They were playing on probably the bounciest pitch in Australia. It wasn’t going to be easy, especially for players who haven’t played international cricket for a couple of months. It was challenging for Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer, who usually play regularly,” Gavaskar said.He added, “India are still a very, very good team. They’ve won the Champions Trophy. Don’t be surprised if Rohit and Kohli score big in the next two games. The more they play, the more time they spend in the nets, the more throwdowns they get — maybe even from reserve bowlers bowling from 20 yards instead of 22 — the quicker they’ll find their rhythm. Once they’re back among the runs, India’s total will be 300, 300-plus.”","Adelaide Oval has historically been a fortress for Virat Kohli.

ACB spokesperson condemns 'barbaric attack' that killed 3 Afghanistan cricketers

Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) spokesperson Sayed Naseem Sadaat announced on Tuesday that the board possesses clear evidence, including video footage, implicating Pakistan in an attack that killed three local cricketers in Afghanistan's Urgun district. The incident has prompted Afghanistan to withdraw from next month’s Tri-Nation T20I Series scheduled to be held in Pakistan.The statement comes after the Pakistan government denied reports of cricketers being killed in an airstrike.""We got evidence all the cricket fraternity and all the people around the world would have definitely watched our video report on the incident that was made by our media team. So, we got clear evidence that the attack was done by a Pakistani state,"" Sadaat told ANI.The ACB spokesperson confirmed that the board has officially decided to withdraw from the upcoming tri-series hosted by Pakistan.In a post on X last Friday, the ACB reported that the attack had caused multiple casualties, including three local cricketers — Kabeer, Sibghatullah, and Haroon — who were returning home after playing a friendly match in Sharana, Paktika province.""The ACB considers this a great loss for Afghanistan's sports community, its athletes, and the cricketing family,"" the board stated.""We call upon all the cricket boards to condemn such barbaric attacks because cricket is a game that carries the message of peace. Cricketers are peace ambassadors and they should be stayed away from the war. War should not be interfered in sports. So we call upon all the cricket fraternity and boards to condemn such attacks and keep cricket away from war,"" Sadaat said.Both the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have expressed their support for the ACB following the tragic incident.Zimbabwe has since stepped in to replace Afghanistan in the tri-series, joining Pakistan and Sri Lanka.The series will begin on November 17 in Rawalpindi, with Pakistan facing Zimbabwe in the opener, followed by Zimbabwe taking on Sri Lanka at the same venue. The remaining five matches, including the final on November 29, will be played at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium.","Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) spokesperson Sayed Naseem Sadaat announced on Tuesday that the board possesses clear evidence, including video footage, implicating Pakistan.

Poll Do you believe Sarfaraz Khan's exclusion from the India A squad was justified? Yes, based on performance No, he should have been selected Unsure

Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan weighed in on the growing debate around Sarfaraz Khan ’s exclusion from the India A squad for the upcoming first-class matches against South Africa A, urging caution against turning cricket selection into a political or communal issue.Sarfaraz, who turned 28 on Wednesday, was not included in either of the two squads led by Rishabh Pant, despite an impressive domestic record, including a first-class average of over 100 in the last five years.His omission reignited discussions among fans and observers questioning whether the Mumbai batter remains in contention for India’s second-string side.""Selectors and the coach (management) will always have a plan. Sometimes it might look wrong in the fans’ eyes, but please don’t twist things or create narratives that aren’t even close to the truth,"" Pathan wrote on X, seemingly in reaction to the discussion and debate that was flaring up on the internet.Congress national spokesperson Shama Mohamed fueled the debate on social media, alleging religious bias in the non-selection and questioning the stance of head coach Gautam Gambhir.“Is Sarfaraz Khan not selected because of his surname! #justasking. We know where Gautam Gambhir stands on that matter,” she wrote on X.The remarks drew sharp criticism from BJP leader Shehzad Poonawalla, who described the comments as divisive. “Stop dividing India on communal lines, caste lines. Keep your dirty political communal agenda out of cricket Shama,” he said, noting that other Muslim players, Mohammad Siraj and Khaleel Ahmed, remain part of the team.Reacting to the contrasting opinions, Pathan emphasized the need to focus on the game rather than letting social media and political narratives create unnecessary tension. He highlighted how quickly wild conclusions were being drawn without context, urging fans and leaders to respect the selection process.Pathan’s remarks come at a time when Sarfaraz’s international appearances have been sporadic. After making his Test debut under Rohit Sharma against England in February last year, he has scored 371 runs in six Tests at an average of 37.10, with a century and three fifties.His last outing for India was in the home series against New Zealand in November 2024, and he has since been left out of major tours, including the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, the England tour, and the home series against the West Indies.The debate around Sarfaraz’s exclusion from the India A team was also understood as the 'door being shut' for him, as emphasized by former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin.",Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has defended the call to not include Sarfaraz Khan from the India A squad.

Poll Who do you think will win the crucial match between India and New Zealand? India New Zealand

: Playing at a familiar venue in the tournament at last, a nervous-looking India, grappling with the pressure of expectations of a home World Cup, will look to control their fate and seal the last semifinal berth in what would be a virtual quarterfinal against T20 World Cup champions New Zealand, in the 2025 Women’s ODI World Cup at the DY Patil Stadium on Thursday.Coming off three disappointing defeats on the trot against SENA countries, Harmanpreet Kaur ’s side, facing mounting criticism and still trying to figure out their best combination, will aim to become the fourth team to book the semifinal berth if they get the better of the White Ferns here.However, any more mistakes and another poor outing will leave India dependent on other scenarios in a format which sees only four teams eliminated out of eight after the conclusion of an exhaustive group stage .Struggling to find their rhythm and still struggling to find their best combination, India, thanks to New Zealand's last two matches, against Sri Lanka and Pakistan in Colombo being washed out, must consider themselves lucky that they are still in the race for the semifinals.From here too, New Zealand has a tougher ask than India in order to make the cut.Even if they lose to New Zealand, India will be in contention if they beat Bangladesh in their last league match at the same venue on Sunday, provided the White Ferns lose to England on October 26 in Vizag.New Zealand, on the other hand, must win both their remaining matches against India and England in order to make the semis.The fact that they clinched the Women's T20 World Cup exactly a year ago in UAE, and that they have a good record against India - 34 wins in 57 WODIs, including six in the last nine since 2022, should give New Zealand plenty of encouragement.During their victorious T20 World Cup campaign, the White Ferns outplayed India by 58 runs.With only the white-ball platform to showcase their skills - the New Zealand women's team hasn't played Test cricket since 2004 - veteran players skipper Sophie Devine and Suzie Bates will be keen to add one more crown in their cabinet.Facing a 'do-or-die' situation, New Zealand will bank on their skipper Devine, who is also the third highest run-getter with 260 runs in five matches at an average of 86.66, including a century and two fifties.A couple of days before this key clash, India's training session was washed out due to unseasonal rain.However, the weather was clear on Wednesday, even as the ground was covered with white sheets in the evening in case it rains. Thankfully, the weather is likely to hold up on match day.Showing the tendency to choke at the sight of victory, India have repeatedly cracked under pressure despite having a majority of the game in their grasp. While both Australia and South Africa exposed the chinks in India's bowling armour with spirited chases, Harmanpreet Kaur & Co suffered one of their most haunting defeats in Indore when they failed to make 56 from 54 balls with seven wickets intact on a batting paradise.The shocking loss revived the unpleasant memories of a similarly heartbreaking defeat in the summit clash of the 2017 Women's World Cup. On July 23, 2017 at Lord's India, chasing 229 against tournament hosts England, were cruising at 191 for three in the 43rd over, but suffered a sensational collapse that saw them lose seven wickets for 28 runs in 29 balls, folded up for 219 in 48.4 overs and went on to lose by nine runs.Even as they started their campaign with wins against weaker sides like Sri Lanka and Pakistan, much of India’s problems can be traced back to the fact that, in search of allrounders, they opted for a playing combination with no sixth bowling option available for the first four matches.On a flat pitch at Vizag, it was a strategy which led to defeats against Australia and South Africa.A major relief for India from Indore was the much-needed return to form of skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, who made a superb 70-ball 70 after managing to score just 71 in four matches previously. However, the 36-year-old batter must curb her tendency to keep employing the cut shot -all her dismissals in the World Cup have been to deliveries pitched outside off-stump. Perhaps, playing more in the 'V' can help her rediscover her 'World Cup midas touch,' which has seen her average 50 in the previous two WODI World Cups.While she has been preferred over Jemimah Rodrigues, No 3 batter Harleen Deol has not been able to convert her impressive starts, getting out for 48, 46, 13, 38 & 24.The pitch at the DY Patil Stadium has traditionally been a belter, but it offered plenty of help to the spinners during the low-scoring thriller between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.Surprisingly, though they've played in many T20Is at this venue, this is the first time that the Indian women's team will play a WODI at the DY Patil Stadium. The Indian players also have the experience of playing WPL matches here.It's apparent that India rely heavily on Smriti Mandhana at the start and Richa Ghosh in the death overs for the big hits. So far, none of India's top batters have lasted long enough to finish games, and none of the lower-order batters seem to have the strength to clear the boundaries. The bowlers started off well, but have failed to deliver consistently.After she took three for 20 in 10 overs to star in India's 88-run win over Pakistan, 22-year-old pacer Kranti Goud has completely gone off the radar, conceding two for 59 in nine overs against South Africa, 0 for 73 in nine overs against Australia and 0-46 in eight overs against England.",India take on New Zealand in the 2025 Women's ODI World Cup on Thursday.

Australia extended their unbeaten run in the ICC Women’s World Cup with a dominant six-wicket win over England in Indore on Wednesday, powered by all-rounders Annabel Sutherland and Ashleigh Gardner.Opting to bowl, Australia’s attack kept England in check, restricting them to 244/9. Tammy Beaumont top-scored with a composed 79 off 108 balls, but regular wickets prevented the innings from really taking off.Sutherland (3/60) led the charge with the ball, supported by Gardner (2/39), Sophie Molineux (2/52), and Alana King (1/20).England got off to a bright start as Beaumont flicked and drove fluently, bringing up her first fifty of the tournament off 44 balls. Amy Jones (18) and skipper Heather Knight (20) offered brief support before both fell to tight bowling from Sutherland and Molineux.Nat Sciver-Brunt’s early dismissal further dented England’s plans, while Sophia Dunkley (22) struggled to find momentum against King and Molineux, who maintained sharp lines.Late efforts from Alice Capsey (38) and Charlie Dean (26) helped England cross 240, though the side once again suffered a familiar middle-order collapse.Australia’s chase began shakily, losing three wickets for just 24 runs within the first six overs as Linsey Smith and Lauren Bell found movement and accuracy with the new ball. Beth Mooney (20) steadied the innings briefly before falling to Smith.From there, Sutherland and Gardner took control, displaying composure and authority in a record-breaking partnership. Gardner’s fluent strokeplay complemented Sutherland’s solidity as the pair rebuilt with intent, dispatching loose deliveries to the boundary and rotating strike efficiently.Sutherland, who finished unbeaten on 98, narrowly missed out on a century but anchored the chase perfectly.Gardner remained not out on 104, ensuring Australia reached the target with 57 balls to spare.The 180-run stand not only sealed victory but also underlined Australia’s batting depth and ability to recover from difficult starts.With this result, Australia reclaimed the top spot on the points table and reaffirmed their status as tournament favourites, while England were left to rue another lost opportunity despite a promising start.",Australia beat England by six wickets in the ICC Women's World Cup.

Indian captain Shubman Gill was left visibly surprised during an interaction with a fan in Australia, after a video surfaced online showing a man shouting “Pakistan Zindabad” while shaking hands with him.The incident, which appears to have taken place during a casual outing in Adelaide, has since gone viral on social media. In the clip, Gill, whi is dressed in a black hoodie and light blue jeans, is seen walking when a fan approaches him for a handshake.The Indian skipper briefly pauses to greet the fan, but as soon as their hands touch, the man yells “Pakistan Zindabad,” leaving Gill momentarily stunned. The captain however, handled the situation calmly as he pulled his hand back and walked ahead without breaking his stride. He did not react any further.The post has since been widely circulated among cricket fans from both nations.The Indian team is currently in Australia for a three-match ODI series. After losing the opening game in Perth, Gill and his side are preparing for the second ODI in Adelaide, which is now a must-win match to stay alive in the series after the disappointing start.While the incident has sparked debate online, Gill appeared composed and unbothered in the video, choosing not to respond to the remark and continuing his walk.The viral clip comes at a time when fan interactions between Indian and Pakistani supporters often attract heightened attention, especially during high-profile tours and tournaments. Even in the recently concluded Asia Cup, tempers flared between players, which culminated in a messy award ceremony where India were denied the trophy by ACC president and PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who denied them from celebrating.Gill, leading India in the ongoing ODI series, will look to put the incident behind him as he focuses on guiding his team back into contention when they face Australia in the second ODI on Thursday.",Indian captain Shubman Gill was left visibly surprised during an interaction with a fan in Australia.

'Don't know why people are talking about Pratika's strike rate'



Poll Do you agree with Amol Muzumdar's decision to prioritize a sixth bowler over keeping Jemimah Rodrigues? Yes, it was the right call No, Rodrigues should have played

: Going by India women's team head coach Amol Muzumdar 's words, middle-order batter Jemimah Rodrigues could return to the playing XI for the key match against New Zealand in the 2025 Women's ODI World Cup at the DY Patil Stadium on Thursday.India went with a sixth bowler for the game against England, choosing to play seamer Renuka Singh Thakur while dropping Rodrigues in the process. At the pre-match press conference, Muzumdar said that the Mumbaikar took the decision well and hinted that the combination may be different for the match in Navi Mumbai.""It was one of the tough calls, because given the circumstances, given the conditions in Indore, we opted for the sixth bowling option and that's why one of the batters had to sit out just looking at that combination. But it was a tough call. She took it very nicely and that's what Jemimah is all about. She's fantastic within the group. A superb role model for everyone in the team. She took it really nicely and very sportingly. I appreciate that. We go on a match-by-match basis,"" Muzumdar said.Meanwhile, Muzumdar brushed aside the criticism around Pratika Rawal's strike-rate ahead of the clash against New Zealand.The Indian opener has been the second-highest run-getter for India in the World Cup so far, scoring 186 runs in five matches at an average of 37.20 and strike rate of 70.99.The Delhi batter has been consistent since her debut in December at Vadodara against West Indies in Dec last year, but is a bit sedate with her approach, especially in the powerplay overs, leaving India's talismanic batter Smriti Mandhana the task of boundary-hitting.""I mean, if you look at Pratika Rawal's progression from last December when she made her debut in international cricket, she averages around 50 and her strike rate is around 82, 83, if I'm not wrong. I think that's fantastic and we would like her to continue the way she bats and the entire team is behind her and Harleen as well. And, you know, I don't think any discussion has happened over on that particular subject,"" said Muzumdar.The coach also said he was unsure about why the topic of strike-rate came up regarding Pratika as she has made a fine start to life in International cricket. In 22 WODIs, the 25-year-old has scored 988 runs at an average of 47.04, with one hundred and seven fifties, at a strike rate of 81.92.""I don't know why this is coming up.

Zimbabwe secured a historic victory on home soil, defeating Afghanistan by an innings and 73 runs at the Harare Sports Club to claim their first home Test win since 2013 and record their biggest-ever Test triumph.

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: Defends Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and blames Perth weather

Poll Do you think Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli should have played more matches before the ODI against Australia? Yes, it would have improved their performance No, they're experienced enough Maybe, but not necessarily I don't have an opinion

Former Indian cricketer Irfan Pathan criticized cricket stalwarts Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli for their poor performance in the first ODI against Australia at Perth, attributing their failures to a lack of game time. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Pathan emphasized the importance of following proper processes regardless of a player's stature, while praising Rishabh Pant for choosing to play against South Africa A before returning to international cricket.Rohit and Virat, who last played for India during the ICC Champions Trophy victory in March, had disappointing outings in Perth, scoring eight and zero respectively. Their limited game time was due to their retirement from Tests before the England tour and T20Is last year.The duo missed significant cricket action, including a five-Test series in England, the T20I Asia Cup, and a home series against West Indies comprising two Tests. Their only competitive cricket during this period was the IPL from April to June.""But you have to do the things that are needed, you have to complete the processes, you have to play matches. In this regard, they have fallen behind. If they had played some matches before coming, and shown some form, the team management might have thought seven batters are enough, and we can include Kuldeep Yadav. But now, since the team is unsure of the form of three players, it is not happening,"" Pathan said.Pathan acknowledged that while Rohit and Virat wouldn't be judged solely on individual performances given their impressive ODI records, the process of match preparation remains crucial.""It is not like they (Virat, Rohit, and Shreyas Iyer) did not have a lot of options to play cricket during the break. I believe that no matter how big a player you are, when it comes to Indian cricket, you have to make sure that you return after following the proper process. We have seen both Rohit and Virat work hard, but match fitness and normal fitness are two different things. For example, Rishabh Pant, coming after injury, will play for India 'A' against South Africa 'A',"" he added.""Pant, who is a match-winner in Tests, if he wants, can say that he is fit, I am fine, I will play the Tests against South Africa straightaway. But, no. It does not happen like that, and that is why he will be playing for India 'A', and that is how exactly it should happen,"" Pathan concluded.","Former Indian cricketer Irfan Pathan criticized cricket stalwarts Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli for their poor performance in the first ODI against Australia.

Poll Do you think Sarfaraz Khan should have been selected for the Indian squad against South Africa A? Yes, he deserves a chance. No, he needs to prove himself more.

Social media erupted over the exclusion of 28-year-old Khan, who has recently shed a lot of weight and scored heavily in India's domestic cricket in recent years, as people asked what more he could do to secure a call-up.On Tuesday, when the national selection committee picked the Indian squad for the two first-class games against South Africa A, Sarfaraz, who will celebrate his 28th birthday on Wednesday, didn’t find his name in either of the two squads to be led by Rishabh Pant.Prolific domestic batter Sarfaraz Khan boasts a first-class average of 65.19 across 56 matches and an astounding 117.47 over the past five years, scoring 2,467 runs with 10 hundreds and five fifties.Earlier this year, the 27-year-old shed 17 kg to prove his fitness, scoring consistently against England (50 in three Tests) and New Zealand (150 in the first Bengaluru Test) in the 2024-25 home season. Despite this, he hasn’t played a single Test since being overlooked for the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia.Returning from a quadriceps injury that kept him out of the Duleep Trophy and Irani Cup, the Mumbaikar looked in rhythm, scoring 42 and 32 in his comeback innings against J&K.Former India cricketer R Ashwin blasted the Ajit Agarkar-led selection panel for ignoring Sarfaraz Khan.""When I examine Sarfaraz's non-selection, I don’t receive any explanation. I am very sad and feel sorry for him. Had I been the selector, what would I have called him up and said?,"" Ashwin said on his YouTube channel.""He has reduced his weight, and he has been scoring runs; he also scored a century in his last Test series.""And this sort of non-selection leads me to think that someone must have been thinking that we have seen enough of him, and we no longer want him, so we don't want to go in that direction.""If I were Sarfaraz Khan, that is what I would be thinking. He has been dropped from the India A side. It's literally like the door has been shut.""Where will he perform? Now, if he performs well in first-class cricket, they will say he is very good only for first-class cricket.""So he won't get picked for India A now. Where will he go and prove his credentials? Where will he show that he has improved? So, such non-selection feels like someone's decision, whether from the management side or the selection side, that we are no longer looking at him.”",Sarfaraz Khan was left out of India's squad for two first-class games against South Africa A.

Poll What impacts do you think the cancellation of the Miami match will have on La Liga's international growth? Negative impact on growth Opportunity for better domestic focus No significant impact

La Liga’s plan to stage a Barcelona match in Miami this December has been cancelled, with the league’s president, Javier Tebas, calling it a “missed opportunity” for Spanish football.The fixture, which would have seen Champions Barcelona face Villarreal on December 20 in the United States, was set to be the first-ever European league game played abroad. Following the cancellation, the match will now take place as scheduled at Villarreal’s Estadio de la Cerámica.La Liga said the decision came after its promoter pulled out due to “uncertainty generated in Spain in recent weeks.” The move had been heavily criticised in the country, drawing protests from players and opposition from other clubs.The Spanish Footballers’ Association (AFE) staged demonstrations last weekend, with players pausing for 15 seconds at the start of matches to show their disapproval. Real Madrid also expressed opposition to the plan, arguing that playing abroad could undermine the league’s competitive integrity.Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois said the proposal “would adulterate the competition,” while Madrid captain Dani Carvajal described it as “a stain” on La Liga.Despite the pushback, Tebas defended the league’s intentions, lamenting the missed chance to grow Spanish football internationally. He wrote on X, “This historic opportunity has been lost. We miss a chance to develop, to project ourselves in the world and reinforce our future.”""And others, perhaps unknowingly and in good faith, have been drawn into debates about information that was already addressed in 2018, where that supposed “information”—which they had then and have now—was merely an excuse to kill the project,"" he further added.He also criticised critics who questioned La Liga’s motives, saying, “We are appealing to the 'integrity of the competition' from those who have been questioning this same integrity for years, putting pressure on referees and managers, constructing distorted narratives or using political and media pressure as a sporting tool.”The cancelled Miami match would have been a landmark event as per the league president, highlighting La Liga’s ambition to expand its global reach.With the game now returning to Spain, attention will shift back to domestic competition, while discussions about future international fixtures are expected to continue.","La Liga’s plan to stage a Barcelona match in Miami this December has been cancelled.

Mexican security firms are gearing up to provide armoured vehicles and protection services for wealthy tourists during the 2026 FIFA World Cup , which Mexico will co-host with the United States and Canada from June 11 to July 19. The growing security industry, driven by concerns over criminal violence and drug cartels, offers various services from bulletproof cars to armed escorts.Leopoldo Cerdeira, head of security firm Ruhe, demonstrated his fleet's armour plating capabilities by firing bullets into a car door at his Mexico City warehouse. His company maintains 70 armoured vehicles, with plans to expand to 80 for the World Cup.""Our bookings are for tourists, people who have money, who come to see the matches but are afraid because they have heard bad things about Mexico,"" said Cerdeira at his company's headquarters.The security industry has expanded beyond luxury armoured vehicles to include drivers, armed escorts, bomb protection, bulletproof vests, and armoured briefcases. This growth is largely attributed to Mexico's high crime rate, with approximately 30,000 murders annually.""The country's insecurity has led to the growth of our industry,"" said Gabriel Hernandez, head of Armoring Group, which sells bulletproof cars and clothing for civilians and military personnel in Mexico, Spain and the United States.Three Mexican cities will host World Cup matches: Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara. The capital has installed 40,000 additional CCTV cameras and will restrict drone usage in all host cities.Guadalajara, home to the Jalisco Nueva Generacion Cartel (CJNG), presents particular security challenges. The United States has designated CJNG as terrorists and offered a $12 million reward for their leader's arrest.Security companies offer various protective features, including electric shock car handles, pepper spray-releasing wheels, and puncture-resistant tires that can run for 80 kilometers. Daily rental rates for armoured vehicles range from $800 to $1,100, with additional costs for drivers and escorts.Drug cartels have developed their own security measures, creating heavily armoured vehicles known as ""monsters."" Authorities recently discovered a clandestine armouring workshop in Sinaloa state.The security industry faces challenges with cartels recruiting their workers. Cerdeira lost two employees to criminal groups eight years ago, who were later found dead in Sinaloa despite being offered triple their salaries.Security consultant David Saucedo, who works with embassies and local authorities, suggests the cartels may not directly threaten the World Cup.""They themselves have a social base that will benefit from the matches,"" explained Saucedo, who also suggested the possibility of an unofficial agreement between authorities and cartels to maintain peace during the tournament.Ruhe's fleet has already provided services to FIFA delegations and will be used for the upcoming Mexican Formula 1 Grand Prix, demonstrating the growing demand for security services in high-profile events.Mexico City, which previously hosted World Cup finals in 1970 and 1986, typically experiences less cartel-related violence compared to other host cities. Local authorities have emphasised their commitment to ensuring security during the tournament.","Mexican security firms are gearing up to provide armoured vehicles and protection services for wealthy tourists during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

La Liga has canceled plans to host a historic Barcelona versus Villarreal match in Miami this December due to mounting uncertainty within Spain, marking the end of what would have been the first European league fixture played abroad.The match, originally scheduled for December 20 at the Hard Rock Stadium, will now take place at Villarreal's home ground, Estadio de la Ceramica.La Liga's promoter decided to cancel the event, with the organisation expressing deep regret that the project could not proceed, viewing it as a missed opportunity to showcase Spanish football internationally.Barcelona issued a statement accepting the decision, noting they had also accepted the initial decision to play in Miami.""Barcelona respect and accept the decision to cancel the match against Villarreal in Miami... just as we respected and accepted the decision to play when it was made at the time,"" the club stated.The Catalans also expressed disappointment about missing the chance to expand in a strategic market and that US fans would miss seeing the game in person.The timing of La Liga's announcement drew criticism from Villarreal coach Marcelino Garcia Toral, as it came during his team's Champions League match against Manchester City.""It seems to me an absolute lack of respect to put out a statement at half-time of a game about something that was planned but will not happen. It's a lack of respect to the directors of the club, the club itself, the professionals and the fans,"" Marcelino stated.The proposal faced significant opposition within Spain. The Spanish Footballers' Association organised protests, with players remaining stationary for 15 seconds at the start of each league match last weekend.Real Madrid opposed the plan institutionally, with their captain Dani Carvajal telling La Liga president Javier Tebas that playing games abroad would be ""a stain"" on the competition.Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois argued it would adulterate the competition.La Liga has attempted to organise overseas matches for several years. This attempt came closest to fruition after receiving permission from UEFA , European football's governing body.UEFA maintained its general opposition to overseas games but agreed to allow this match as an exception, along with an upcoming Serie A match between AC Milan and Como planned for Australia in February.The ticket presale, scheduled to begin on Tuesday, was initially delayed before the entire plan was abandoned.","La Liga cancels plans to host a historic Barcelona versus Villarreal match in Miami this December.

Goa police too had officially sought a status report on the Portugal superstar’s arrival.“Al-Nassr have informed FC Goa today that Ronaldo will not travel,” a source who has been tracking the development told TOI on Monday. “Even when FC Goa sought confirmation yesterday, they were asked to wait till today. The club is expected to make an official statement now.”Coach Jorge Jesus and the management believes it’s important to manage Ronaldo’s game time, particularly since the star is now 40 and keen to take part in next year’s FIFA World Cup 2026, which will be his record sixth appearance at the biggest sporting event on earth.Lothar Matthaus, Antonio Carbajal, Rafa Marquez, Gianluigi Buffon, Andres Guardado, Guillermo Ochoa and Lionel Messi are the others in the elite club of players with appearances at five different World Cups.Even without Ronaldo, Al-Nassr have done well in the AFC Champions League Two, winning both their games.

Liverpool faced their fourth consecutive defeat, a first in 11 years, as Manchester United secured a 2-1 victory at Anfield on Sunday. Harry Maguire scored the winning goal with a header in the 84th minute, giving United manager Ruben Amorim his first back-to-back Premier League wins.Cody Gakpo had equalised for Liverpool, cancelling out Bryan Mbeumo's early goal that came just 61 seconds into the match.Liverpool now trails Arsenal by four points at the top of the table. Manager Arne Slot continues to seek the right combination after spending £450 million on new players.United moved up to ninth place, now just two points behind Liverpool. This victory marks Amorim's most significant win in his nearly one-year tenure.Liverpool's previous dominance in this fixture was notable, having lost only one of their last 14 Premier League meetings. United hadn't won at Anfield since January 2016.Liverpool's current struggles follow a period of transition after rebuilding their title-winning squad. The team was also affected by the tragic loss of Diogo Jota in a July car accident.The match started poorly for Liverpool, who were already dealing with three consecutive losses under Slot.Mbeumo scored the opening goal, getting past Virgil van Dijk and finishing from Amad Diallo's pass.Liverpool protested the goal, arguing that play should have stopped when Alexis MacAllister suffered a head injury from Van Dijk.Slot kept £100 million signing Florian Wirtz on the bench again, trying to balance defensive and attacking needs.Gakpo nearly scored when his shot hit the post from Mohamed Salah's pass, in Liverpool's best first-half move.United missed an opportunity to extend their lead when Bruno Fernandes hit the post from the edge of the area.Liverpool's record signing Alexander Isak almost scored his first Premier League goal, but Senne Lammens made a crucial save.Gakpo was unlucky as his deflected cross hit the post, and he later hit the woodwork again early in the second half.Slot introduced Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike after an hour, joining Salah, Gakpo, and Isak in attack.Salah, despite his scoring record in this fixture, missed a clear chance when he shot wide with only Lammens to beat.Liverpool finally scored when Federico Chiesa, who had just replaced Isak, provided a low cross for Gakpo to convert from close range.United quickly responded as Maguire headed in Fernandes's cross, exposing Liverpool's defensive weaknesses.Gakpo had a late chance to equalize but headed wide from Jeremie Frimpong's cross.The defeat ended Liverpool's year-long unbeaten league run at Anfield, damaging their hopes of winning a record 21st English top-flight title.","Manchester United beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield on Sunday.

There weren't too many chances. I think overall it could've gone either way,"" Frank said.""I think 1-1 would've been a fair result.

Josh Allen’s grandmother gives him a reason to smile again



Josh Allen recharges during bye week, ready to lead the Bills’ rebound



The Buffalo Bills returned to practice after their bye week hoping to shake off a two-game skid and rediscover their rhythm. With key players like DaQuan Jones and Taylor Rapp sidelined by injuries, it hasn’t been an easy stretch for Buffalo. Yet, amid the concern and frustration, quarterback Josh Allen found inspiration from an unlikely but deeply personal source — his grandmother.While Allen addressed the media about the team’s current mindset, it wasn’t a game plan or statistic that captured attention. It was a heartfelt phone call from his grandmother. After a tough loss to the Atlanta Falcons, she called with a simple, powerful reminder: “I just wanna see you smile.”Allen shared the story with a laugh, but his grandmother’s words clearly struck a chord. “Being in the quarterback position, a lot of people look at this position,” Allen said. “They draw sometimes strength from it or can be inspired by this position… My grandma called me and was like, ‘I just wanna see you smile.’” Josh Allen's grandmother, Patricia, died unexpectedly in November 2020.The reigning MVP acknowledged that the grind of the season had dimmed some of his usual energy.“It’s no fun obviously, losing. And maybe that’s why. It’s a lot easier to smile when you’re winning,” he admitted. Yet, he emphasized the importance of bringing “energy and juice” back to practices — encouraging teammates to celebrate small victories, spike the ball, and find joy in the game again.For Allen, the message hit home because his grandmother rarely gives advice. “Not too often,” he said. “So obviously when she says something, I’m going to be listening.”During the bye week, Allen took time to reset mentally — something he admits he needed. “Try to disconnect and not think about it,” he said. “Allow your mind to kind of reset and be refreshed… We’ve got a lot of work to do, but this is a team that cares for each other.”That mindset could be exactly what Buffalo needs as they prepare to face Carolina. The Bills’ struggles — from offensive inconsistency to defensive lapses — have been glaring. But if Allen’s grandmother’s wisdom takes root, the solution might start with something simple: smiling again.Because when Josh Allen plays loose, confident, and joyful, the entire Bills team follows his lead. And if that spark returns, so might Buffalo’s winning ways.Also Read: Sean Payton defends himself after fans accuse him of shading Russell Wilson over Jaxson Dart praise","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen found inspiration from his grandmother.

Sean Payton defends his comments on Jaxson Dart



A complicated past between Sean Payton and Russell Wilson



Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton found himself in the middle of controversy this week after his comments about quarterback Jaxson Dart were interpreted as a dig at his former player, Russell Wilson . Following Denver’s thrilling 33-32 comeback win over the New York Giants on Sunday, Payton praised Dart’s performance, but Wilson wasn’t amused.After the Broncos’ stunning fourth-quarter rally, Payton told reporters, “They found a little spark with that quarterback. I was talking to [Giants co-owner] John Mara not too long ago, and I said, ‘We were hoping that change would’ve happened long after our game.’” The remarks quickly went viral, with many assuming they were aimed at Wilson, who started the first three games of the season for the Giants before being benched in favor of Dart.Wilson, never one to stir public drama, broke his silence this time. He took to social media, calling Payton’s remarks “classless” and even referencing the infamous “Bountygate” scandal that led to Payton’s suspension in 2012. The response stunned fans, given Wilson’s usually composed demeanor and his history with Payton in Denver.On Wednesday, Payton clarified his stance. “Look, in the euphoria, the way that game unfolded, that was strictly about Dart,” he explained.“That was in no way, shape, or form anything directed at Russ. And I might be able to see how he might perceive that, but there was no intention at all.”Their rocky history adds context to the misunderstanding. Wilson, once a nine-time Pro Bowler and Super Bowl champion with the Seattle Seahawks, was traded to the Broncos in 2022. However, his stint in Denver was far from successful. He went 11-19 as a starter and never reached the playoffs. Payton, who joined the Broncos in 2023, benched Wilson late in the season before the team released him—despite eating $85 million in dead money.Now 36, Wilson has taken a backup role behind Dart in New York. The rookie has injected energy into the Giants, throwing seven touchdowns and rushing for three more in four starts. While Wilson has publicly supported Dart, Sunday’s postgame comments hit a nerve, reopening old wounds.Payton’s clarification may cool things temporarily, but the exchange underscores how fraught their partnership was in Denver. As both men try to move forward with new teams and new goals, their brief but turbulent chapter together still lingers—proof that in the NFL, even old stories can spark new drama.Also Read: Joe Burrow latest injury update: Bengals optimistic quarterback’s recovery could spark late-season surge","Denver Broncos head coach Sean Payton's comments about quarterback Jaxson Dart were interpreted as a dig at his former player, Russell Wilson.

Aaron Rodgers shares what he told Broderick Jones after the accidental tackle



Broderick Jones responds with humor and admiration



In a moment that perfectly captured the mix of intensity and humor in football, Aaron Rodgers found himself unexpectedly on the ground—not because of an opposing defender, but due to his own teammate’s excitement. During Thursday’s loss to the Bengals, Steelers tackle Broderick Jones’s overzealous touchdown celebration led to a hilarious on-field collision that quickly became the talk of the game.After one of Rodgers’s four touchdown passes—a stunning 68-yard connection to tight end Pat Freiermuth—Jones sprinted toward the veteran quarterback to celebrate. In his enthusiasm, the 6-foot-5 tackle accidentally took Rodgers down from behind. What might have looked alarming at first turned into a lighthearted locker room story.“Brod is always the first one to come find me after a play. It could be a first big pass down to D.K. [Metcalf] on third down, he's coming and dapping me up,” Rodgers said with a laugh, via ESPN’s Brooke Pryor. “What you don't see after the video is he's coming over to me and shaking me and shaking me.”The quarterback later texted his younger teammate, jokingly writing, “I love everything you're about, but also, I’m 41—You can’t be tackling me like that.” Rodgers added with a grin, “I love Brod, we had a couple laughs about it and I told him I’m getting him next.He better watch his back.”While the incident sparked laughter, it also highlighted the genuine bond between the two. Rodgers, who’s still managing his recovery and workload after his Achilles injury a couple of seasons ago, knows how precious every hit—or in this case, every celebration—can be.Jones wasn’t offended by Rodgers’s reaction. In fact, he embraced the moment with good humor. “We’re still joking about it,” Jones told reporters. “Yeah, he was a little mad, but sorry, you know, it’s football. It gets intense. Still, no love lost. It’s just the energy that he brings and that I bring.”And with a mischievous smile, Jones added, “We shall see on Sunday, after he throws another touchdown, I might tackle him again.”For the Steelers, this playful moment reflects a deeper chemistry developing within the locker room. Rodgers threw for 249 yards and four touchdowns that night, proving his elite form hasn’t faded. But while his arm remains powerful, the team will likely hope his linemen keep their celebrations a little less physical next time.Also Read: ""As the King of the USA..."": Fans want Donald Trump to use his power as Roger Goodell shuts down rumors of Bad Bunny’s removal from Super Bowl halftime show","Aaron Rodgers shares what he told Steelers' Broderick Jones after surprise tackle.

Key matchups ahead will test their resilience as they eye a late-season surge.

Bengals gain new life as Joe Burrow’s rehab shows strong progress

Playoff hopes rest on surviving without Joe Burrow for a few more weeks

The Cincinnati Bengals may finally have a reason to exhale. After weeks of uncertainty surrounding Joe Burrow ’s recovery, the latest reports suggest the star quarterback is making steady progress and could return in time to rescue the team’s postseason hopes.According to NFL insider Jordan Schultz, Joe Burrow’s rehab is “going excellent,” putting him on track for a mid-December return, around Week 15 or 16. That timeline gives the Bengals a fighting chance to stay relevant in the AFC playoff race.Schultz emphasized the significance of this update, noting, “If they beat the Jets and they go to 4-4, with the way the AFC North is shaping up, the way that Joe Burrow is rehabbing… it would be very sensible for Cincinnati to add another player at the deadline.”That possibility has sparked optimism within the organization. The trade for veteran quarterback Joe Flacco already stabilized the team, and if the Bengals can string together wins, management may look to strengthen the roster rather than sell. Schultz also made it clear that “Cincinnati right now has no intention on trading their star pass-rusher,” referring to Trey Hendrickson, signaling the team’s commitment to competing rather than rebuilding.NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport backed Schultz’s report, saying Burrow is “on track (and) doing well, has had no setbacks,” adding that the quarterback “absolutely intends to be back” once cleared. The challenge, however, lies in staying afloat during his absence.The Bengals’ next few weeks won’t be easy. After facing the struggling New York Jets in Week 8, Cincinnati’s schedule tightens with matchups against playoff-caliber teams like the Bears, Steelers, Patriots, and Bills. They’ll also face the Ravens twice, games that could decide their postseason fate.Still, with Flacco showing flashes of his Super Bowl-winning form and the defense holding firm, the Bengals’ outlook has shifted from grim to cautiously hopeful. If Burrow’s recovery stays on course, Cincinnati could enter mid-December with their franchise quarterback back under center and a real shot at turning a lost season into a late playoff push.Also Read: Dak Prescott’s fiancée Sarah Jane Ramos teases wedding plans as the couple prepares for their big day","Joe Burrow's recovery is progressing well, with reports indicating a mid- December return.

His remarks came weeks after the NFL officially announced Bad Bunny as the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show performer.Goodell addressed the controversy head-on, noting that criticism is nothing new when it comes to Super Bowl performances. “I’m not sure we’ve ever selected an artist where we didn’t have some blowback or criticism,” he told ESPN and NFL.com. “It’s pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching.”He emphasized that Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, was chosen after careful consideration. “We’re confident it’s going to be a great show,” Goodell said, adding that the artist “understands the platform that he’s on” and will bring an “exciting and united moment.”Describing the 31-year-old hitmaker as “one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world,” Goodell said the decision reflects the NFL’s effort to create a halftime experience that celebrates both entertainment and cultural diversity.“That’s what we try to achieve. It’s an important stage for us,” he added.Bad Bunny expressed his excitement about the historic opportunity during an interview with Apple Music 1’s Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden. “I’m really excited about the opportunity — for my friends, my family, Puerto Rico, all the Latino people around the world,” he said. “It feels really good… so it’s a very special thing for us.”However, not everyone shared the enthusiasm. President Donald Trump called the decision “absolutely ridiculous,” admitting, “I don’t know who he is.” Meanwhile, Trump ally Corey Lewandowski warned that ICE would be present at the game, reigniting political debates around immigration and Latino representation. Even, fans react in a way that they want Trump to intervene in this matter.Despite the noise, the NFL stands firm. Goodell confirmed that there are no plans to replace Bad Bunny, though he hinted that “additional talent” could join the show.The Super Bowl will take place on February 8, 2026, at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, promising not only a game to remember but a halftime show poised to make cultural history.Also Read: “So proud”: Shakira praises Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl headline moment as a victory for Latin artists amid growing controversy","NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has full faith in Bad Bunny as the headliner for the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show.

“She’s terrified”: Taylor Swift reportedly anxious about Travis Kelce’s resurfaced college drug scandal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shes-terrified-taylor-swift-reportedly-anxious-about-travis-kelces-resurfaced-college-drug-scandal/articleshow/124749856.cms,"Pop star Taylor Swift is reportedly concerned as a past incident involving NFL player Travis Kelce has resurfaced. Kelce's college drug test failure from 2010 is causing Swift anxiety about her image. Insiders suggest Swift fears this could affect her carefully crafted, family-friendly brand. Despite this, the couple's bond is believed to be strong, showcasing redemption and love.

A past mistake comes back into focus for the NFL star

Taylor Swift’s image concerns and protective instincts

While Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce ’s relationship continues to charm fans around the world, a shadow from Kelce’s past has reportedly left the pop superstar unsettled. According to insiders, a resurfaced incident from the Kansas City Chiefs tight end’s college years has sparked unexpected concern for Swift, who has long maintained a carefully curated public image.Before becoming one of the NFL’s most charismatic figures, Travis Kelce faced a significant setback early in his career. In 2010, while playing for the University of Cincinnati, he was suspended from the football team after failing a drug test for marijuana.The event, which kept him out of the Sugar Bowl that year, became a major turning point in his life. Kelce has previously described that period as a “wake-up call,” noting that he sought therapy and worked hard to rebuild both his career and his character.However, the story has recently resurfaced, reportedly unsettling Swift. One insider told Radar, “Taylor hates that this has become a talking point again. She’s spent years crafting a clean, family-friendly image, and she’s terrified that something from Travis’s past could smear that.”Another source added, “She’s incredibly proud of how hard he’s worked to turn his life around – but this story coming back up makes her feel exposed.Taylor’s brand thrives on control and positivity, and this just isn’t part of that narrative.”Despite the chatter, those close to the couple insist that Swift’s feelings come from a place of caution, not judgment. She reportedly remains fully supportive of Kelce but is aware of how even small controversies can escalate in today’s viral media culture. “She’s been advised that, technically, prior drug admissions can create issues for U.S. re-entry under federal law,” one insider explained, suggesting that her concern might also have a legal dimension.Swift, who has built her empire on integrity and relatability, is known for being fiercely protective of her reputation and the people she loves. As one source summed up, “Taylor’s worked too hard to keep her image spotless. She doesn’t want Travis’s past, however old it is – to haunt her now.”Still, fans believe that this power couple’s bond remains unshakable, proof that love, trust, and redemption can coexist, even under the brightest spotlight.Also Read: “She’s desperate”: Meghan Markle reportedly anxious about missing an invite to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s star-studded wedding","Travis Kelce's college drug test failure from 2010 is causing Swift anxiety about her image.

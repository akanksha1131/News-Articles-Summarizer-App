Harmanpreet Kaur on World Cup final: 'Look forward to see women's cricket in a more serious manner'

Poll Which previous final was more disappointing for India? 2005 against Australia 2017 against England 2020 against Australia

Twice unlucky — in the finals of 2005 and 2017 — India have fought their way into the Women’s World Cup final for the third time, where they will take on a spirited South Africa in the summit clash at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday.India first reached the ODI World Cup final in 2005 under Mithali Raj’s captaincy, marking a watershed moment for women’s cricket in the country. Playing against a dominant Australian side in Centurion, India were outclassed as Karen Rolton’s unbeaten century powered Australia to a 98-run victory.Twelve years later, India made a stirring comeback in the 2017 World Cup final at Lord’s. Powered by Harmanpreet Kaur ’s explosive 171 in the semifinal against Australia and Punam Raut’s fighting 86 in the final, India came agonisingly close before falling nine runs short against England.In 2020, the focus shifted to the T20 World Cup final at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground. A record crowd of 86,000 watched as Alyssa Healy’s blitzkrieg 75 off 39 balls led Australia to an 85-run win over India.Recalling India’s campaign in the 2017 ODI World Cup, when they finished runners-up to England, the skipper said: “The last time we reached the finals, after coming back we saw a big change in India. Women’s cricket has progressed, and we see a lot of girls on the ground now,” she said.“I’m sure that when we win this final, we will see many more changes and cricket will improve further, not only at the international level but also at the domestic level. We are really looking forward to that moment when women’s cricket will get more seriousness and more viewership.”India, who are in an ODI World Cup final for the third time, have lost each of their three matches to the Proteas since 2017, including their narrow three-wicket loss at Visakhapatnam earlier in the league stage.","India will face South Africa in the Women's World Cup final on Sunday.

New Zealand have recalled Kyle Jamieson and Ish Sodhi for the upcoming KFC T20I series against the West Indies, starting Wednesday night at Eden Park, Auckland.The 14-member squad also features uncapped all-rounder Nathan Smith from the Wellington Firebirds, who could make his T20I debut after being part of the squad against Sri Lanka last season.Jamieson returns from a side injury that sidelined him during the ODI series against England, while Sodhi makes his comeback to the T20I setup after facing Australia at the Mount earlier in October.This five-match series will serve as New Zealand’s final T20I assignment before coach Rob Walter announces his preliminary squad for the ICC T20 World Cup 2026, to be held in India and Sri Lanka next February.Coach Rob Walter welcomed the returns of Jamieson, Smith and Sodhi.“Kyle’s been back bowling this week and is tracking nicely for this series,” he said.“Nathan’s made an impressive start to his international career in the Test and ODI formats and we back him to do the job if he gets his T20 chance in this series.“Ish is our most capped T20I player and it’s always great to be able to add his skills, energy and experience to the group.“Matt has played every game for the BLACKCAPS since the tour to Zimbabwe in July - so it’s the right moment for him to have a short break and the fact he will also get some time to rehab his calf is another upside.”Pacer Matt Henry will miss the series to focus on a planned conditioning program after recovering from a calf strain, while Kane Williamson wasn’t available following his retirement from T20 Internationals earlier in the day.New Zealand will be without several key players for the upcoming T20I series, as Finn Allen (foot), Lockie Ferguson (hamstring), Adam Milne (ankle), Glenn Phillips (groin), and Ben Sears (hamstring) have all been ruled out due to injuries.The West Indies are set to arrive in New Zealand on Sunday and will play five T20Is, three ODIs, and a three-Test series extending up to Christmas.Mitchell Santner (C), Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Jacob Duffy, Zak Foulkes, Kyle Jamieson, Daryl Mitchell, Jimmy Neesham, Rachin Ravindra, Tim Robinson, Tim Seifert (wk), Nathan Smith, Ish Sodhi","New Zealand have recalled Kyle Jamieson and Ish Sodhi for the upcoming KFC T20I series against the West Indies.

Harmanpreet Kaur on World Cup final: 'Look forward to see women's cricket in a more serious manner'

Here’s how it works:

If rain interrupts play and the game can’t be completed on Sunday, it resumes on Monday from the same situation.

If a truncated match resumes and is halted again, the reduced overs will carry over to the reserve day.

And if the reserve day is also washed out, India and South Africa will share the trophy as joint winners — a first in Women’s World Cup history.

NEW DELHI: Cricket fans across India are holding their breath — not just for the high-stakes ICC Women’s World Cup final between India and South Africa at the Dr DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai on Sunday, but also for the unpredictable Mumbai skies. While Harmanpreet Kaur ’s team stands on the brink of history, rain could yet play spoilsport in what promises to be a blockbuster title clash.According to the latest forecast, there’s a 25–50% chance of showers through the afternoon and evening. The humidity is expected to remain high, and variable cloudiness could result in stop-start conditions during play. The mercury is likely to touch 34°C, dropping to 25°C at night.However, fans can take comfort in the fact that the International Cricket Council (ICC) has made provisions to ensure the final produces a fair result. A reserve day has been kept aside for the title clash — scheduled for Monday, November 3 — if rain prevents play on Sunday.If the skies open up during the match, officials will attempt to complete the game on the same day, even if it means reducing overs. As per ICC rules, both teams must play a minimum of 20 overs each to constitute a result.If that’s not possible, the match will continue from the exact point where it stopped on the reserve day.With a record crowd expected and both teams chasing a maiden title, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Harmanpreet Kaur’s side, fresh from a thrilling semi-final win over seven-time champions Australia, will look to seize the moment — provided the weather gods stay kind in Navi Mumbai.For now, all eyes are on the skies, as cricket and rain prepare for a tense duel alongside India and South Africa’s date with destiny.","The ICC Women's World Cup final takes place in Navi Mumbai on Sunday.

Abhishek Sharma press conference: On tough Australian conditions, Harshit Rana's fight

Poll Do you think Bumrah's performance was affected by trying too hard to take wickets? Yes, definitely No, it was just an off day

NEW DELHI: Former India batter Robin Uthappa offered a candid assessment of Jasprit Bumrah ’s rare off day, suggesting that the pacer tends to lose rhythm when he tries too hard to take wickets.Speaking on Star Sports after India’s four-wicket loss to Australia in the second T20I at the MCG, Uthappa said the team’s eagerness to force breakthroughs backfired early in the innings.“When we were bowling after scoring 125, the start was very important. If we had picked up two or three wickets in the first three or four overs, the game could have been closer because we have quality spinners in the middle overs,” Uthappa said. “I felt we were probably trying too hard to pick up wickets. So we got a little wayward.”Defending a modest total of 125, India needed early strikes from Bumrah, but the Australian openers, Mitchell Marsh and Travis Head, counterattacked brilliantly. Their 51-run opening stand set the tone for a dominant chase that was completed in just 13.2 overs. Varun Chakaravarthy dismissed Head and later added another scalp, emerging as India’s best bowler on the night.Uthappa singled out Bumrah’s performance for closer analysis, pointing to a recurring tendency. “I have observed that whenever Bumrah gets desperate to pick up wickets, he becomes slightly wayward. When he is disciplined and hits a good line and length, he mostly picks up wickets,” he explained. “Australia took full advantage of that waywardness at the start.”While Bumrah struck twice in his final over, the damage was already done. India’s lack of discipline in the powerplay allowed Australia to dominate early, leaving their bowlers chasing the game.",Robin Uthappa says Jasprit Bumrah loses rhythm when he tries too hard to take wickets.

India vs Australia: Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma rewrite history at SCG

NEW DELHI: Indian Premier League (IPL) Chairman Arun Dhumal praised Team India’s impressive bench strength while highlighting the talent of 14-year-old prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi. He also lauded “greats” Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli for their class, conviction, and work ethic. Dhumal expressed confidence that Rohit and Kohli are far from done in the 50-over format, applauding Rohit’s batting masterclass in the recently concluded three-match ODI series against Australia, where he was named Player of the Series.Rohit and Kohli shrugged off the rust and lack of rhythm from the first two ODIs — both defeats — to launch a stunning counterattack against Australia in the third ODI. Chasing 237, the duo powered India to victory with Rohit slamming an unbeaten 121* and Virat anchoring the innings with a rock-solid, risk-free 74*.The performance sent a strong signal — the icons are not done yet and remain serious contenders for the 2027 ICC Cricket World Cup.""We've been talking about this bench strength of the Indian team for a long, long time. But look at this team, a 14-year-old wonder, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, he's knocking at the door to be part of the team.And then you have these greats like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, who people think are going, but they are not going. They are here to stay. And the way Rohit has shown his class in this ODI series, at that age, coming as player of the match in the final match and then player of the series, that shows the kind of conviction that they carry, the kind of hard work that they put in. When it comes to Team India, they will want to give it their best. And that is the true reflection of a sportsman. And my best wishes to both of them. They have done wonderful. They have given their life to Indian cricket,"" Dhumal told ANI.The Australia series was a testament to Rohit’s grit, determination, and match-winning ability.From struggling with a single-digit score in Perth to grinding out a valuable 97-ball 73 in Adelaide — where he curbed his natural attacking instincts — and finally unleashing a blistering unbeaten 121 off 125 balls in Sydney, the ‘Hitman’ experienced it all in this 202-run series. He showed the world that his eyes remain firmly set on the 2027 World Cup, determined to meet every fitness and cricketing goal along the way.Following his stellar performance against Australia, Rohit created history on Wednesday by becoming the No. 1-ranked batter in the ICC Men’s ODI Rankings for the first time in his career. He climbed two spots to the top after his unbeaten century in the Sydney ODI, leading India to an emphatic nine-wicket triumph.Rohit’s consistency saw him surpass Afghanistan’s Ibrahim Zadran and India teammate Shubman Gill, claiming the top ODI batter ranking for the first time. The 38-year-old has remained a fixture in the top 10 for most of the past decade.","Indian Premier League (IPL) Chairman Arun Dhumal praised Team India’s impressive bench strength while highlighting the talent of 14-year-old prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi.

Despite being rushed to hospital and placed on life support, he passed away on Thursday — a tragedy that has left the cricket world in shock.“No words can ease the pain of losing someone so young. Ben Austin was only 17, with dreams yet to take flight. Thinking of his loved ones and the entire cricket family in this difficult time. Rest in peace, Ben,” Dhawan wrote on X.His message resonated deeply with fans across both nations, as players and officials offered condolences and tributes to the young cricketer.The tragedy has revived painful memories of Phillip Hughes, who died in 2014 after being struck in a similar manner. It has also reignited discussions about safety measures in the sport, particularly the use of neck and stem guards at the grassroots level.Across Australia, clubs and fans paid tribute through the “Bats Out for Benny” campaign — placing bats outside homes and clubhouses.

4234 - Babar Azam

4231 - Rohit Sharma

4188 - Virat Kohli

3869 - Jos Buttler

3710 - Paul Stirling

Pakistan’s premier batter Babar Azam etched his name into cricket’s record books on Friday, surpassing Rohit Sharma to become the highest run-scorer in men’s T20 internationals, as Pakistan crushed South Africa by nine wickets to level the three-match series 1-1.Babar, recalled for his first T20 series in nearly a year, needed just nine runs to go past Rohit’s tally of 4,231 runs. The former Pakistan captain reached the milestone in his typically composed fashion — with a gentle single driven off spinner Donovan Ferreira to long-off — before finishing unbeaten on 11. He now has 4,234 runs in 130 matches, including 36 fifties and three centuries, at a strike rate of 129.The record comes as a moment of redemption for the 31-year-old, who had missed the chance to break it in the first match after falling for a two-ball duck. His return among runs — and to Pakistan’s T20 setup — was timely, following criticism over his exclusion from the Asia Cup, where Pakistan struggled against India.While Babar’s milestone dominated headlines, it was Saim Ayub’s explosive unbeaten 71 off 38 balls that sealed Pakistan’s emphatic win.The left-hander, who endured a nightmare Asia Cup with four ducks, rediscovered his touch in spectacular style — smashing five sixes and six fours as Pakistan chased down 111 in just 13.1 overs.“Saim is someone who can play for the next 10 years and become the player we all want him to be,” captain Salman Ali Agha said after the game. “We bowled really well up front, and when you bowl that well you’re always going to win the game.”Earlier, Pakistan’s bowlers had dismantled South Africa for 110, with Salman Mirza (3-14) and Faheem Ashraf (4-23) sharing seven wickets.South Africa’s stand-in captain Donovan Ferreira admitted his team was outplayed.“There isn’t much time to reflect,” Ferreira said. “The wicket got a lot better with the dew settling. You just have to move on.”The third and deciding T20 will be played on Saturday, with the series tantalisingly poised — and Babar Azam standing tall as T20 cricket’s new run king.",Babar Azam surpasses Rohit Sharma to become the highest run-scorer in men's T20 internationals.

Abhishek Sharma press conference: On tough Australian conditions, Harshit Rana's fight

NEW DELHI: The two swashbuckling left-handers — India’s Abhishek Sharma and Australia’s Travis Head — share a good camaraderie. The duo have previously played together for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL and are now facing off in the ongoing T20I series between India and Australia.During the second T20I, Head and Abhishek were seen chatting and sharing a few laughs on the field.After Australia’s four-wicket win, Abhishek, who addressed the media, was asked about his on-field conversation with Head.""I was trying because I knew he’s not going to give me anything. He’s the kind of batter who doesn’t think too much, but still, I was asking him a bit about the pitch and how he was going to perform.

""We wanted to take a couple of wickets early.""I was a bit nervous but got going in the end,"" he added of his batting. ""Head took the pressure off. Should be a good three games to come.""Alongside Hazlewood, Xavier Bartlett and Nathan Ellis also picked up two wickets each.The win gave Australia a 1-0 lead in the five-match series after the opening game in Canberra was washed out. The third match will be played in Hobart on Sunday.""The way he (Hazlewood) bowled in the powerplay, if you're four down in the powerplay it's difficult to recover from that,"" said India captain Suryakumar Yadav, whose side slumped to 40-4 after the first six overs.""Abhishek has been doing this for quite some time now,"" he added about the Indian opener.""He knows his game and his identity and he is not changing it anymore and hopefully he sticks to it and plays many more knocks like this for us.""I think we need to do what we did in the first game,"" Yadav said about the next clash in Hobart.

Abhishek Sharma press conference: On tough Australian conditions, Harshit Rana's fight

Poll Do you agree with Ashwin's assessment that Arshdeep Singh deserves a spot in the starting XI? Yes, he should be in the team. No, there are better options.

Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has strongly criticised the team management for leaving out Arshdeep Singh from the playing XI in India’s second T20I against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Friday.India endured a tough outing as they were bundled out for 125 in 18.4 overs, with Josh Hazlewood taking three wickets. Australia chased down the target with ease, winning by four wickets in just 13.2 overs.Speaking on his YouTube channel after the match, Ashwin questioned the selection call, saying that if the management wanted to experiment, it should have been Jasprit Bumrah — not Arshdeep — who was rested.“If you want to experiment, then rest Bumrah. Bumrah is the one with workload management issues. You can rest Bumrah,” Ashwin said. “See, Arshdeep Singh is your leading wicket-taker. When we will play the T20 World Cup, there will be some dew… But this Arshdeep debate is definitely something that’s very sad because Arshdeep Singh deserves his place.”Ashwin went on to underline that Arshdeep should be one of the first names on India’s team sheet in the shortest format.“My point is, Arshdeep Singh’s name should be the second name on your fast bowlers’ list when Bumrah is playing. And if Bumrah isn’t playing, then Arshdeep becomes your first-choice bowler on that team list. I just cannot understand how Arshdeep Singh keeps missing out from the XI in this side. I really don’t get it,” he added.The veteran spinner also acknowledged that Harshit Rana, who featured in the match, did “reasonably well,” but stressed that Arshdeep’s omission reflected a deeper issue of player rotation and opportunity.“It’s not about Harshit. The way Arshdeep performed in the 2024 T20 World Cup, and yet since then, he has consistently found ways to stay out of the team. He’s been benched so many times when he should have been playing,” Ashwin said.Arshdeep, India’s leading T20I wicket-taker with 101 wickets in 65 matches, last featured in the 2025 Asia Cup, where Ashwin felt he looked “rusty” due to limited match time.“He actually lost a bit of rhythm… he looked rusty. And your champion bowler will start looking rusty if you don’t give him game time,” Ashwin noted. “I genuinely hope he starts getting the chances he deserves, man. He deserves to be there. And it’s not about someone else, that’s his spot. Please, play him.”","Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has criticised the team management for leaving out Arshdeep Singh from the playing XI in India’s second T20I against Australia.

Former Pakistan captain Babar Azam on Saturday broke Virat Kohli's T20I record during his match-winning knock of 68 runs off 46 balls, guiding Pakistan to a four-wicket victory over South Africa in the final game of their three-match series in Lahore on Saturday. The win sealed a 2-1 series triumph for Pakistan, who successfully chased down South Africa's 139-9, reaching 140-6 in 19 overs.South Africa, fielding an inexperienced squad, began the series with a commanding 55-run win in Rawalpindi, but Pakistan bounced back strongly with consecutive victories in Lahore to clinch the series.Babar, who had been overlooked for nearly a year, made a strong comeback as Pakistan continues to fine-tune its batting lineup ahead of next year’s T20 World Cup.After a duck in the opening match, Babar surpassed Rohit Sharma’s record for most runs in T20s with his unbeaten 11 in the second game. His composed innings in the final match showcased renewed confidence, particularly against pacers who struggled with the wet ball due to heavy dew.Babar shared a crucial 76-run stand with captain Salman Ali Agha (33), which proved decisive in Pakistan’s chase.“This innings was long due,” Babar said. “I backed myself, and the team believed in me.It’s about how you absorb pressure. I just wanted to play according to the situation.”Though Pakistan briefly stumbled with four wickets falling for 14 runs, Babar’s knock had already set the foundation for victory.With this innings, Babar now holds the record for the most fifty-plus scores in T20Is — 40 (37 fifties and 3 hundreds) — surpassing Virat Kohli, who has 39 (38 fifties and 1 hundred). This was also Babar’s first T20I fifty since May 2024 against Ireland.","Former Pakistan captain Babar Azam broke Virat Kohli's T20I record during his match-winning knock of 68 runs off 46 balls.

Abhishek Sharma press conference: On tough Australian conditions, Harshit Rana's fight

Indian cricket is buzzing with new energy. Under head coach Gautam Gambhir , the team has stepped into a bold new era — one that demands commitment to a fearless brand of cricket, with a lineup that bats deep and adapts seamlessly to the game’s pulse.At first glance, the approach might seem brazen, forcing players to reinvent themselves and stray from their natural styles. Yet, this is precisely the direction the shortest format has taken globally. Top-tier teams like Australia and England have already embraced similar philosophies, recognising that T20 cricket now rewards multi-dimensional players who can contribute across all facets of the game.And at the forefront of this approach is Abhishek Sharma , the 25-year-old opener who appears well-suited to the team’s evolving style. With a high backlift and quick hands, he looks to set the tempo early, often taking on the bowlers from the start of his innings.His 68 off just 37 deliveries in the second T20I against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) perfectly encapsulated everything Gambhir envisions — intent, adaptability, and fearless execution.On a lively, pace-friendly surface that exposed the technical frailties of his teammates, Abhishek’s innings stood out as a lone beacon in what eventually became a four-wicket defeat.That loss, however, also came with a silver lining for India ahead of the third T20I in Hobart. Australia’s chief tormentor from Melbourne, Josh Hazlewood , has been rested ahead of the Ashes later this month.The high-risk, high-reward mantra will inevitably bring mixed results, but the team is prepared to live with that volatility. Just as captain Suryakumar Yadav ’s recent lean patch hasn’t rattled Gambhir, the defeat in Melbourne, too, is being viewed through the lens of a long-term transformation.“Surya’s batting form doesn’t concern me because we have committed to an ultra-aggressive template in our dressing room. When you embrace this philosophy, failures are inevitable,” the head coach said before the start of the Australia series.The brave new set-up has necessitated certain personnel and tactical shifts—many of them as intriguing as they are controversial. The most debated move has been the preference for fast-bowling allrounder Harshit Rana, aimed at extending the batting depth all the way down to No. 8.Adding to the intrigue, Harshit was promoted above Shivam Dube in the batting order during the MCG clash—a decision that raised eyebrows even as the 23-year-old justified it with a composed 35 off 33 balls.Other bold calls, like benching Arshdeep Singh, India’s all-time leading T20I wicket-taker, or handing Dube the new ball in the Asia Cup final, underscore Gambhir’s willingness to back courage over convention.",Abhishek Sharma scored 68 off just 37 deliveries in the second T20I against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) Head coach Gautam Gambhir has committed to an ultra-aggressive template in the dressing room.

South Africa’s captain Laura Wolvaardt , currently the tournament’s leading run-scorer with 470 runs, issued a Pat Cummins-like warning ahead of the Women’s World Cup final to be played on Sunday in Navi Mumbai.Just like Australia’s captain Pat Cummins , who had vowed to silence the Indian crowd during the pre-match press conference ahead of the 2023 Men’s ODI World Cup final at the Narendra Modi Stadium, Wolvaardt, too, wants to keep the Indian fans quiet.Despite South Africa winning their last three matches against India since 2017, including a recent league stage victory in Visakhapatnam, Wolvaardt believes knockout games have different dynamics.India enters their third ODI World Cup final, seeking their first tournament victory and their first win against South Africa since 2005.The recent head-to-head record shows South Africa's dominance, with the Proteas securing three consecutive victories over India since 2017.""Knockout cricket is completely different to league cricket. We've seen people are able to do some very special things in knockout games like we saw from Jemi the other night,"" Wolvaardt said, referencing Jemimah Rodrigues ' unbeaten 127 against Australia in the semifinal.""I don't think we're going to be looking into our group game against them. We know we have to play some really good cricket. They're a really strong side and have just come off of a really good game as well, so they'll be high on confidence. We can't sort of bring any of our history into this game, whether it would be finals that we've lost or games that we've won against India, we're just really trying to erase all of that stuff and start completely afresh,"" she added.The Proteas captain acknowledged the challenge of playing against India with a packed home crowd but suggested it could also pressure the hosts.""It's going to be a very tough game with the whole crowd behind India, probably a sold-out stadium. It's going to be a very exciting opportunity, but at the same time, it puts a lot of pressure on them as well,"" Wolvaardt said.""They have the whole country behind them and are sort of expected to win. It's going to be a really big crowd — probably the biggest crowd that a lot of our girls have not played in front of — a lot of eyeballs on the game, a lot of added pressure,"" she added.When asked about silencing the Indian crowd, Wolvaardt simply responded, ""Hopefully we win. I guess that will silence them.""The South African captain highlighted how this World Cup final, featuring neither Australia nor England, reflects women's cricket development.""It just shows how much the women's game is developing and how different countries are being able to use new resources and develop really good quality cricketers,"" she said.South Africa enters their first ODI World Cup final, having previously lost in the finals of the last two T20 World Cups.""I'm really trying not to think about the result in those finals or the first time I was in the final, you automatically think about the trophy and about winning,"" Wolvaardt stated.""The first time you're in those finals it feels like a really big, fast paced event, whereas we need to all slow it down and take a big breath and hopefully we're able to do that as a group.""Wolvaardt credited head coach Mandla Mashimby for providing inspirational leadership to the team.""Mandla normally does the really inspirational stuff, that 'you're carrying your country' type of thing. I just come in with a little 'stay calm girls' at the end. I think it'll be super important for us to just stay as present as we can tomorrow,"" she said.""There's going to be a lot of noise, a lot happening, a lot of maybe different routines than you're used to in a normal game. But it's just a game of cricket and whichever team is able to do the basics for long and sort of hold their nerve for longer.""",South Africa face India in the Women's ODI World Cup final on Sunday in Navi Mumbai.

Pakistan’s stars stood tall under pressure as fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi’s fiery spell and a timely half-century from Babar Azam powered the hosts to a four-wicket win over South Africa in the third Twenty20 International at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on Saturday, sealing a 2-1 series victory.Chasing 140, Pakistan reached the target in 19 overs, finishing at 140 for six, thanks to Babar’s commanding 68 off 47 balls — his first T20I fifty after 13 innings. The victory came in front of a packed crowd of 32,000 fans, who roared as the former Pakistan captain cracked three consecutive boundaries off Ottneil Baartman to bring up his 37th T20I half-century.Earlier, Shaheen Afridi ripped through South Africa’s top order with a 3 for 26 spell, reducing the visitors to 139 for 9. His double-strike in the very first over — removing Quinton de Kock and Lhuan-dre Pretorius for ducks — left South Africa reeling at 0 for 2. The situation worsened when Dewald Brevis survived an early lbw appeal but was soon dismissed by debutant Usman Tariq, who finished with 2 for 26.Reeza Hendricks (34 off 36) and skipper Donovan Ferreira (29 off 14, including three sixes) offered some resistance, adding 34 for the fifth wicket, while Corbin Bosch’s unbeaten 30 helped South Africa post a respectable total.In reply, Pakistan stumbled early with Saim Ayub (0) and Sahibzada Farhan (19) dismissed within seven overs. But Babar Azam and Salman Agha (33) steadied the innings with a 76-run stand for the third wicket. Despite a late wobble after Babar’s dismissal to Bosch, Usman Khan (6 not out) sealed the win with a calm single.Captain Agha praised his team’s resilience after bouncing back from an early series deficit.“I am happy at the come-from-behind series win,” Agha said. “We were 1-0 down, so it was a great effort by the players to win the next two.”South Africa’s Ferreira admitted his side’s batting collapse proved costly.“We lost wickets in clusters and didn’t score much, but credit to the bowlers for keeping it tight,” he said. “It was a great learning for us.”",Pakistan beat South Africa by four wickets in third Twenty20 International.

New Zealand batting legend Kane Williamson on Sunday announced his retirement from Twenty20 internationals, calling time on a decorated career in the shortest format to give his team “clarity” ahead of next year’s ICC T20 World Cup.The 35-year-old leaves as New Zealand’s second-highest run-getter in T20Is, scoring 2,575 runs in 93 matches at an average of 33.44, including 18 half-centuries. A calm leader and a pillar of consistency, Williamson guided the Black Caps to the 2021 T20 World Cup final, where his classy 85 went in vain against Australia, and to semi-final finishes in 2016 and 2022.Explaining his decision, Williamson said the time was right for both him and the team. “It’s the right time for myself and the team. It gives the team clarity for the series moving forward and ahead of their next major focus which is the T20 World Cup,” he said in a statement released by New Zealand Cricket (NZC).“There’s so much T20 talent there and the next period will be important to get cricket into these guys and get them ready for the World Cup,” he added.Williamson had already signed a “casual” central contract with NZC — a flexible arrangement that allows him to choose his availability.He recently confirmed plans to scale back his international workload to spend more time with his young family and play in domestic T20 leagues around the world.The veteran batter will miss the upcoming T20 and ODI series against the West Indies but remains available for the three-Test series in December.NZC chief executive Scott Weenink lauded Williamson’s immense contribution, saying the board fully respected his decision. “We’ve made it clear to Kane he has our full support as he reaches the back end of his illustrious career. We’d love to see him play for as long as possible, but there’s no doubt he will go down as a legend of New Zealand cricket.”",Kane Williamson has announced his retirement from Twenty20 internationals.

I hope the upcoming final will be even better.”The former all-rounder urged fans to look beyond just the result and appreciate the quality of cricket the team has displayed throughout the tournament.“I understand that to some extent you want victory, but the kind of cricket they play should be discussed more,” he said. “Winning would bring more happiness. However, playing good cricket, as they have been doing, is also highly valued.”Kapil signed off with a message for the entire nation: “I want to say best wishes to the entire team, not just from me, but the whole of India who wants these girls to play better.

Shreyas Iyer injury: Greenstone Lobo says Iyer got lucky, predicts comeback

TimesofIndia.com

NEW DELHI: After spending a week in the hospital, out of which a few days were in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), India ODI vice-captain Shreyas Iyer was finally discharged on November 1 after a nasty fall during the third ODI vs Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG).Iyer, however, will continue to stay in Sydney for the next ""seven to ten days"" for some follow-ups and will have his sister Shreshta by his side during the period. It is understood that the right-hander wants to spend some time by himself before returning back to India after the traumatic few days due to the blunt injury to his abdomen. While the medical team of the Indian cricket team ensured swift action after the fall, Iyer was not in a good state when he was rushed to hospital.Ashad reported earlier, his vitals dropped to dangerously low levels and normalcy was restored only after he received treatment at a specialist facility. There was a period where he was admitted to the ICU wing when the internal bleeding hadn't stopped and he only had the Indian team doctor, who stayed back with him, and some friends, who happened to be in the city during that time.After that week, the last thing the right-hander wants is needless glare and attention, and doesn't want to rush in taking that flight back to Mumbai.It is further learnt that return to cricket or rehabilitation is not the priority right now as all stakeholders are focussed on his complete well-being at the moment. The moment he gets back home, and normalcy resumes, is when the future course of action will be decided.""It is very premature to put a date on his return or chart the way forward from here on. Physical and mental well-being is of utmost importance right now and everything else will happen once that is achieved. There is no question of talking or thinking about cricket at the moment. It will be highly insensitive to do that. He has had a major bout with back injury in the past and this hasn't been a pleasant experience too,"" says a BCCI official.In a medical update issued by the BCCI, the Indian cricket board thanked the doctor in Sydney and the support they got from back home.""The BCCI extends its heartfelt gratitude to Dr Koroush Haghighi and his team in Sydney, along with Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala in India, for ensuring Shreyas received the best treatment for his injury. Shreyas will continue to stay in Sydney for his follow-up consultations and will return to India once he is deemed fit to fly,"" read the statement.","India ODI vice-captain Shreyas Iyer was finally discharged on November 1 after a nasty fall during the third ODI vs Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Harmanpreet Kaur on World Cup final: 'Look forward to see women's cricket in a more serious manner'

Poll Will India win the Women's World Cup final against South Africa? Yes, they will win! No, South Africa will win!

TimesofIndia.com

NEW DELHI: The heartbreak of Rohit Sharma-led India’s 2023 World Cup final defeat to Australia still lingers for many cricket fans across the country. This time, India will be hoping for a different result when the women’s team, led by Harmanpreet Kaur , takes on South Africa in the ICC Women’s World Cup final on Sunday at the DY Patil Sports Academy in Navi Mumbai.This will be the third appearance for the Indian women’s team in a Women’s ODI World Cup final. They lost to Australia by 98 runs in 2005 and fell agonisingly short against England by nine runs in 2017.In this edition of the World Cup, India defeated Australia in the semifinals to storm into the final, where they will face South Africa, who are making their maiden appearance in a World Cup final.Will India finally overcome the final hurdle? How much pressure will be on Harmanpreet Kaur? Will India find it easy against South Africa?Former India captain Anjum Chopra believes Harmanpreet will handle the big stage with ease and that India will emerge victorious.“No pressure. Why would she (Harmanpreet Kaur) feel any pressure? There’s pressure in every game. She’s a senior campaigner who knows what it means to play a World Cup final and win a semifinal.She’s a seasoned player and a proven match-winner. The expectations and pressure that come with any international game are always there — it’s the same here. I don’t think she’ll take or feel any extra pressure. She’ll just want to make the occasion special for herself and for the country. I’m confident these girls will come through with flying colours,” Anjum toldin an exclusive interview.“My wish is that India wins the World Cup,” she added.However, Anjum also cautioned India against underestimating South Africa, praising their consistency in ICC tournaments.“South Africa have been in a World Cup final before — they played two T20 World Cup finals in 2023 and 2024. So it’s not as if they’re new to the stage. In a 50-over format, yes, this is their first time, but most of the players are the same from those T20 campaigns. They know what they missed out on back then and how hard they’ve worked to reach this point after dropping their first game against England and suffering a one-sided loss to Australia. They’ll definitely want to course-correct and aim for a better result this time,” she said.In the semifinals, Jemimah Rodrigues ’ unforgettable 127 not out stunned the seven-time champions Australia and powered India into the final. The emotions were raw — tears, smiles, and joy filled the air as Jemimah sealed India’s spot in the title clash.“The kind of innings Jemimah played — whether it was a World Cup semifinal, final, or even a league game — was simply spectacular. It was brilliant to watch, a true spectacle. As Indians, we wanted to win that game, and she made it even more special. But even if you take the occasion away and just focus on the batsmanship, the temperament, and the skill she displayed — it was a delight to watch. From what I saw sitting in the commentary box, and what the world witnessed, everything about that innings was magnified by the occasion and the quality of the opposition. Her skill level and composure were absolutely outstanding. It was such a joy to watch Jemimah play that kind of innings,” Anjum said.","India take on South Africa in the ICC Women's World Cup final on Sunday.

Joao Pedro lifts Chelsea to glory against Spurs



Liverpool secured a 2-0 victory against Aston Villa in the Premier League , ending their four-game losing streak. Mohamed Salah achieved his 250th goal for the club, and Ryan Gravenberch added another goal to help the defending champions move up to third place in the standings.""I'm glad we are back on track now. It's a very tricky season for us because we have a few new players, they are very good players, but they need time to adapt. We lost some players too. It takes time to adapt and know each other's games, but everything will be fine,"" said Salah.Liverpool manager Arne Slot's decision to make multiple changes during Wednesday's 3-0 League Cup loss to Crystal Palace increased pressure on the returning players to secure a win after six defeats in seven games across all competitions.""What I liked most was that I think everybody here felt the importance of the game. I'm talking about my players and I'm talking about the fans. From start to finish the players showed up,"" said Slot.Liverpool faced early pressure when Morgan Rogers hit the post with a shot after five minutes. This continued their pattern of struggling in the opening 15 minutes, which had been evident in their previous four Premier League defeats.Villa initially showed strength in breaking through Liverpool's defense but later struggled with their own defensive play. Dominik Szoboszlai missed an opportunity after taking the ball from Pau Torres, shooting directly at Martinez.Hugo Ekitike's header goal was disallowed after VAR review showed he was offside from Szoboszlai's cross. Martinez's error then allowed Salah to score just before half-time, marking his 250th goal for Liverpool.Salah's goal, his fifth of the season, places him as Liverpool's third-highest scorer in club history, behind only Ian Rush and Roger Hunt. The goal also ended Liverpool's streak of conceding first in seven consecutive games.Villa entered the match having won their previous four league games, including victories over Tottenham and Manchester City. They were level on points with Liverpool before the game.Gravenberch, who had missed the previous weekend's 3-2 loss at Brentford due to an ankle injury, scored Liverpool's second goal. His shot deflected off Pau Torres, deceiving Martinez.Liverpool achieved their first clean sheet in 11 games. The team now prepares for upcoming matches against Real Madrid in the Champions League and Manchester City in the Premier League.Liverpool's recent poor form has created a significant challenge in their title defence against Arsenal. The victory reduced their gap behind Arsenal to seven points, providing a starting point for their return to the title race.Joao Pedro ended his goal drought for Chelsea by scoring the decisive goal in a 1-0 victory against Tottenham at their home stadium on Saturday.The Brazilian striker scored his first goal since August 30, when he last found the net against Fulham, breaking a nine-game goalless streak across all competitions.Since his £60 million transfer from Brighton during the transfer window, the 24-year-old has only managed to score three times for Chelsea.Chelsea moved to fourth place in the Premier League standings after securing their third win in four matches, trailing Tottenham only on goal difference.Tottenham's struggles at home continue, as they haven't secured a victory at their stadium since defeating Burnley in the season opener in August.Their poor home form in 2025 began under previous manager Ange Postecoglou and has persisted under Frank's leadership.Despite a League Cup defeat at Newcastle, Tottenham's away performances have been stronger, including a convincing 3-0 win at Everton in their last league match.Tottenham supporters are showing increasing dissatisfaction with Frank's tactical approach, which differs from the club's traditional attacking philosophy.An early setback occurred when Lucas Bergvall suffered a head injury and was replaced by Xavi Simons as a concussion substitute.Bergvall showed resistance to the medical staff's decision, pushing one of them before Frank stepped in to calm the situation.Alejandro Garnacho posed Chelsea's primary attacking threat in the first half, testing Tottenham goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario with long-range attempts.Vicario recovered from a knee injury to make a crucial save, denying Joao Pedro after a defensive error by Pedro Porro.Joao Pedro broke the deadlock in the 34th minute, capitalising on Moises Caicedo's pressure on Simons and Van de Ven to score from close range.Frank expressed his frustration with Tottenham's defensive errors by kicking a water bottle on the sideline.Joao Pedro nearly doubled his tally, but Vicario saved his powerful shot following Malo Gusto's assist.Rodrigo Bentancur received a yellow card for a challenge on Reece James, which could have warranted a more severe punishment.Mohammed Kudus tested Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez just before halftime, but his shot was well saved.After the break, Enzo Fernandez missed a clear opportunity, heading over from James' cross from ten yards out.Tottenham's possession problems continued in the second half, leading to growing frustration among their supporters.Vicario was forced to make another save from Pedro Neto's powerful attempt, while Tottenham failed to mount a serious comeback in the closing stages.",Liverpool secured a 2-0 victory against Aston Villa in the Premier League.

Arsenal put more distance between them and the rest at the top of the Premier League table with a composed 2-0 victory over Burnley on Saturday, extending their winning run in the competition to five matches.The result pushed Mikel Arteta’s men seven points clear at the summit and further strengthened their bid to end a two-decade wait for the league title. Viktor Gyokeres opened the scoring with a well-timed header from Declan Rice’s corner in the first half, marking his first league goal since mid-September.Rice then doubled Arsenal’s advantage in the 35th minute, heading home from close range to give the visitors firm control at Turf Moor. Arsenal’s threat from set-pieces once again proved decisive, while their defensive record remained formidable, having conceded just three league goals in ten games this season.Arteta praised the balance in his side’s performances, saying his players had “shown maturity in difficult away games” and were “playing with a real sense of control.” The Gunners have now won nine straight games across all competitions, maintaining a consistent rhythm on both ends of the pitch.Burnley rarely threatened and remain in the bottom three, struggling to find form at home. Arsenal, meanwhile, continue to set the pace in the title race with another confident display built on discipline and precision. Manchester United were held to a 2-2 draw by Nottingham Forest in a tense contest at the City Ground, despite leading twice.Casemiro put United ahead in the first half, giving Ruben Amorim’s side hope of a fourth straight league win. However, Forest, who had not scored a league goal since September 20, produced a spirited response after the break.Morgan Gibbs-White equalised in the 48th minute with a strong header before Nicolo Savona completed a quick turnaround just two minutes later. United were forced to chase the game and eventually found a late equaliser through Amad Diallo, whose sharp volley in the 81st minute ensured the points were shared.Amorim later said his team “created enough to win” but admitted Forest “showed great character.” For Forest, manager Sean Dyche said he was “pleased with the fight shown,” though the result keeps them in the relegation zone, four points adrift of safety.United stay within reach of the top four but were left ruing missed chances in a match that tested their recent resurgence.",Manchester United were held to a 2-2 draw by Nottingham Forest.

Real Madrid manager Xabi Alonso confirmed on Friday that Vinicius Junior will not face disciplinary action for his angry reaction during substitution in last weekend's El Clasico victory over Barcelona, following a team meeting where the Brazilian forward apologised to the club.Vinicius had stormed down the tunnel after being substituted in the 72nd minute of Real Madrid's 2-1 win against Barcelona.

Poll Is Liverpool's season salvageable after the recent defeats? Yes, they can turn it around No, it's too late Maybe, depends on next few games

Liverpool’s season went from bad to worse on Wednesday night as they crashed out of the League Cup following a stunning 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Anfield — their sixth loss in the last seven matches across all competitions.Ismaila Sarr struck twice before halftime and Yeremy Pino added a late third, as Palace inflicted yet another humiliation on Arne Slot’s struggling side. The defeat compounds Liverpool’s growing crisis, coming just days after their 3-2 Premier League loss to Brentford, which further derailed their title defence.Slot’s decision to rest several key players — including Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz — backfired spectacularly. With one eye on crucial fixtures against Aston Villa, Real Madrid and Manchester City, the Dutchman fielded a largely second-string team featuring teenagers Kieran Morrison, Rio Ngumoha and Trey Nyoni.“It’s not Liverpool standards to lose six out of seven,” Slot admitted after the match. “But with the squad we have — maybe 15, 16 fit first-team players — this was the choice I had to make. The schedule is brutal, and next week will be even tougher.”The weakened lineup struggled to keep up with Palace’s intensity. Joe Gomez’s defensive lapse allowed Sarr to open the scoring in the 41st minute, before the Senegalese winger doubled the lead just moments before halftime from Pino’s assist. Substitute Amara Nallo’s late red card only deepened Liverpool’s woes, and Pino’s composed finish in the 88th minute sealed the emphatic win.The result means Palace have now beaten Liverpool three times in 80 days — following their Community Shield shootout win and a 2-1 Premier League victory.Liverpool’s latest defeat leaves Slot under increasing pressure as the club’s season threatens to unravel. With top players out of form, mounting injuries, and growing fan frustration, the next two weeks — featuring clashes against Villa, Madrid and City — could define the fate of his debut campaign.Meanwhile, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle all advanced to the quarter-finals after securing wins in their respective ties.","Liverpool crashed out of the League Cup following a 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace.

Jaire Alexander’s redemption chance with the Eagles



How Alexander fits into the Eagles’ defensive overhaul



The Philadelphia Eagles made a statement move during their bye week, acquiring two-time Pro Bowl cornerback Jaire Alexander from the Baltimore Ravens in a deal that could reshape their secondary. The trade, announced Saturday, sends a 2026 sixth-round pick to Baltimore in exchange for Alexander and a 2027 seventh-round pick. It’s a low-risk, high-upside gamble by a championship contender seeking to plug one of its most pressing weaknesses.Philadelphia confirmed the deal in a statement, saying, ""We have agreed to acquire CB Jaire Alexander and a 2027 7th-round pick from the Ravens in exchange for a 2026 6th-round pick."" The move follows the team’s earlier trade for Michael Carter II from the New York Jets, marking the second addition to their defensive backfield in a week. General manager Howie Roseman’s aggressive approach shows how serious the organization is about tightening a pass defense that has slipped from first in 2024 to 18th this season.For Jaire Alexander, this trade offers a fresh opportunity after a quiet stint in Baltimore.Signed by the Ravens in June on a one-year deal worth up to $6 million, Alexander was expected to revitalize their secondary. Instead, injuries and depth chart competition limited him to just two appearances this season. He was a healthy scratch for five games, including Baltimore’s 28-6 win over the Miami Dolphins.Still, Alexander handled the situation with grace. As Jeff Zrebiec of The Athletic noted, Baltimore’s staff has “raved about how well” he dealt with limited playing time, though he “obviously wants to play” moving forward.Now, he gets that chance in Philadelphia. The 27-year-old cornerback made his name with the Green Bay Packers, where he became one of the NFL’s most respected defenders. From 2018 to 2022, Alexander totaled 10 interceptions and 58 pass breakups, earning All-Pro honors for his ability to lock down top receivers.With Darius Slay and James Bradberry anchoring the corners, the Eagles now have the flexibility to rotate Alexander into various cover packages. Defensive coordinator Vic Fangio can use the bye week to experiment with alignments and coverage schemes before facing Green Bay on November 10—an ironic first matchup for Alexander against his former team.For the Eagles, the timing couldn’t be better. With playoff ambitions in sight, bringing in an experienced playmaker like Jaire Alexander could be the defensive spark they’ve been missing.Also Read: Jordon Hudson hilariously mocks her own viral interview moment with Bill Belichick in clever 2025 Halloween costume",Philadelphia Eagles acquire cornerback Jaire Alexander from Baltimore Ravens.

Shedeur Sanders brings “love and affection” to Coach Prime



A family that stands strong through challenges



The 2025 football season hasn’t been smooth sailing for the Sanders family, but their bond remains as unshakable as ever. While Shedeur Sanders continues to wait for his first real NFL action with the Cleveland Browns, his father, Deion “Coach Prime” Sanders, has been battling through a tough stretch at Colorado. Still, amid the on-field struggles, the family’s love and spirit are proving stronger than any scoreboard.Last week, Shedeur decided to give his dad something far more valuable than a win — a surprise visit. With the Browns on their bye week, the young quarterback showed up at his father’s office, catching Coach Prime completely off guard.In a clip posted on Instagram, Shedeur walked into his father’s office with his trademark swagger before sneaking up behind him. “No matter the season, had to pull up on Pops,” he wrote in the caption. “Family always stands together.”The moment that followed melted hearts across social media. Deion, visibly shocked, turned around with a grin and asked, “Why are you here?” Shedeur’s response was full of warmth: “I know you need your son. I know you need some love and affection.”True to his quick wit, Coach Prime didn’t miss a beat. “You’re playing today.Go get your stuff on,” he quipped, sparking laughter between father and son. The exchange captured everything fans love about the Sanders family — humor, love, and genuine connection. As Shedeur glanced around the familiar room, he added, “It feels good to put my feet back on this carpet.”Shedeur didn’t stop at the surprise visit. He also joined his dad on the sidelines before Colorado’s matchup against Arizona at Folsom Field, wrapping him in a heartfelt hug before kickoff.Both Sanders men have challenges ahead. The Browns’ offensive struggles could soon open a window for Shedeur’s debut, while Deion’s Buffs sit at 3–5 with a chance to rally into bowl contention. But whatever the season brings, one thing’s certain — the Sanders family knows how to stand tall together. Even in a year filled with adversity, their love remains undefeated.Also Read: Jordon Hudson hilariously mocks her own viral interview moment with Bill Belichick in clever 2025 Halloween costume","Shedeur Sanders surprised his father, Deion ""Coach Prime"" Sanders, with a visit during the Browns' bye week.

Jordon Hudson’s Halloween costume takes a self-aware twist



Jordon Hudson and Bill Belichick’s Halloween history



Jordon Hudson brought humor and self-awareness to Halloween this year by turning her most talked-about moment into a costume. Instead of opting for a traditional spooky or glamorous outfit, the 24-year-old chose to recreate her own viral look from earlier this year — the same outfit she wore during her memorable CBS Sunday Morning interview that had fans buzzing. With her signature confidence and wit, Hudson transformed a headline-making moment into a playful statement that had her followers in on the joke.In the Instagram photos she shared, Hudson sported the same outfit she wore when she shut down journalist Tony Dokoupil’s question about how she and her boyfriend, football coach Bill Belichick, first met. With a playful sense of humor, she captioned her post, “The costume I never seem to be able to take off.” The post instantly drew laughs from fans who loved her witty approach to self-parody.While Hudson was having fun with her self-referential look, Belichick spent Halloween leading his UNC Chapel Hill football team during their away game against Syracuse University. The former cheerleader has been a frequent face in the stands since the college football season kicked off in September, traveling across the country to support her 73-year-old boyfriend.Earlier in October, Hudson was seen in Berkeley, California, cheering for the Tar Heels during their matchup against UC Berkeley’s Golden Bears. Known for her spirited fashion, she often tailors her game-day looks to fit the moment — whether she’s decked out in Tar Heel blue or subtly poking fun at media buzz.On Belichick’s coaching debut in September, Hudson carried a purse filled with crumpled papers, a quirky detail that caught fans’ attention online. Even though her Halloween look didn’t go as viral as last year’s, she still kept her trademark humor alive, posting a selfie with the same caption: “The costume I never seem to be able to take off.”Hudson’s latest costume continues a growing Halloween tradition between her and Belichick. Last year, the couple coordinated in a coastal-themed look that paid tribute to New England. Belichick dressed as a fisherman — complete with raincoat, hat, and fishing rod — while Hudson transformed into a shimmering mermaid with jeweled accessories.She playfully captioned those photos, “Ouucchhhh!!! 🪝,” capturing their lighthearted chemistry. Whether it’s on the sidelines or during spooky season, Jordon Hudson continues to show that she knows how to mix humor, fashion, and fun — always with a wink at the headlines that follow her.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes’ Halloween celebration with Brittany and baby Golden melts hearts ahead of Chiefs-Bills showdown","Jordon Hudson turned her viral interview into a Halloween costume.

Every one of us has our own fight. Strength doesn’t look loud sometimes, and sometimes it’s about getting up again and again, no matter who is watching.”On Friday, Antonio Brown turned his social media attention to the Miami Dolphins’ rough NFL season.The former wide receiver shared a photoshopped Spirit Halloween packet featuring Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel. The mock costume called him a “Clueless Head Coach” and included capri joggers, glasses, awkward press conferences, and the team’s 2-7 record.

Seahawks target interior offensive line help to strengthen Sam Darnold’s protection

Sam Darnold reflects on his NFL stops from Jets to Seahawks | FNIA | NFL on NBC (FULL INTERVIEW)

Seattle’s trade deadline move could shape their playoff destiny



The Seattle Seahawks have emerged as one of the strongest teams in the NFC, boasting a 5-2 record and currently occupying first place in the NFC West. Sam Darnold has done a commendable job leading the offense, but the Seahawks understand that consistent protection is critical if they want to remain contenders. As the NFL trade deadline approaches, Seattle’s front office is focused on upgrading the offensive line to give Darnold the time he needs to operate efficiently.According to NFL insider Dianna Russini of, the Seahawks are among the teams exploring offensive line trades before the deadline. Alongside the Los Angeles Chargers, Seattle is reportedly evaluating multiple options to strengthen the unit that has shown promise but lacks depth. While the Seahawks’ line has held up well at times, there’s still concern about interior protection, which has been the main weakness of an otherwise strong roster.The Seahawks’ offensive tackles—Charles Cross and Abraham Lucas—have performed at a high level, giving the offense stability on the edges. Rookie Grey Zabel has also been a bright spot, but issues inside remain a growing concern. Right guard Anthony Bradford has struggled the most, leading the team with 17 pressures allowed and two sacks surrendered.According to Pro Football Focus, Bradford ranks as one of the lowest-graded guards in the league with an 18.0 pass-blocking score, placing him near the bottom among qualified starters.Seattle doesn’t need a complete overhaul, but one key addition could make a major difference. Veteran linemen like Joel Bitonio of the Browns or Kevin Zeitler of the Lions are potential trade targets, bringing both experience and consistency. If Seattle opts to strengthen the center position instead, Raiders standout Jackson Powers-Johnson could be an ideal fit.Finding reliable offensive linemen midseason is never easy, yet the Seahawks’ commitment to improving Darnold’s protection shows how serious they are about staying competitive. A trade for a proven blocker would not only enhance the passing game but also elevate the run attack led by Kenneth Walker III.With the trade deadline set two days after their Week 9 matchup against the Washington Commanders, Seattle’s decision in the coming days could define their postseason chances.Also Read: Taylor Swift steps out in chic monochrome brown look in NYC, flaunting engagement ring from fiancé Travis Kelce",Seahawks are among the teams exploring offensive line trades before the deadline.

'Rohit Sharma-led Team India will clinch the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 title': Astrologer Greenstone Lobo's huge prediction

Gautam Gambhir hits out at critics after India beat Australia to reach Champions Trophy final

In their two meetings in the final of an International Cricket Council (ICC) tournament, New Zealand got the better of India; but the current brand of white-ball cricket India have been playing under Rohit Sharma's captaincy is at a different level. However, former India opener Aakash Chopra warns that the ""process-driven"" Kiwis always manage to present a stiff challenge, which could happen in the Champions Trophy final as well on Sunday in Dubai .In 2000 and 2021, New Zealand defeated India in the finals of the Champions Trophy (then known as ICC KnockOut) and World Test Championship, respectively. With that track record, the Kiwis will fancy their chances of a hat-trick; but the Indian team will be keen to win the fourth ICC title for their stalwarts Rohit and Virat Kohli.""Rohit and Kohli are vying for their fourth ICC title. I am trying to remind myself that we don't know when the next time (India in an ICC tournament final) will come,"" said Chopra on a Star Sports show.Many believe that the final could be the swansong for the two icons, after the duo announced their retirement from T20Is following the T20 World Cup triumph last year. But there've been no such feelers from the Indian camp.Chopra said India's prowess shows in their recent record in ICC tournaments.""This is the third (ICC tournament final) for India in two years after 2023 (ODI World Cup), 2024 (T20 World Cup) and now 2025 (Champions Trophy). So India have played three finals in the last 18 months,"" Chopra recalled.Besides, India also qualified for the final in the first two editions of the World Test Championship and missed out on another final narrowly in the 2023-25 cycle of the red-ball tournament.The former batter added that India have every reason to be wary of the threat Kiwis pose.""The opponents India face are very process-driven (in) how they tackle problems posed to them...They have their roles well defined. It may not appear as a battle of equals against India's pedigree and experience, but New Zealand always punch above their weight,"" he concluded.",India face New Zealand in the Champions Trophy final in Dubai on Sunday. The Kiwis have beaten India in two previous finals of an ICC tournament. Aakash Chopra warns that the Kiwis always present a stiff challenge. India are vying for their fourth ICC title.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118812768,imgsize-47824,width-400,resizemode-4/118812768.jpg"

Pranav's final push for glory

Exclusive | Arjuna Awardee Vantika Agrawal: 'People still ask, 'Chess is fine, but what do you really do?''

NEW DELHI: The soft thud of a yellow smiley-face sponge ball striking the floor again and again barely disturbed the silence of a five-star hotel room, where 18-year-old Pranav Venkatesh and his coach, GM Shyam Sundar M, were putting up during the Chennai Masters in November last year.Standing tall with a table tennis racquet — now a makeshift cricket bat — Pranav had already transformed his room into the quietest battleground ever. And if there was no sponge ball or table tennis racquet? No problem! The student-teacher duo would improvise, turning a bottle cap into a ball and the bottle into a bat, maximising the use of their limited resources.It is a familiar sight of Pranav staying with his mentor before a major tournament.It is unconventional, but it works. Cricket, often seen by the mentor as a break from the mental grind, has become part of Pranav’s preparation routine for chess.""Cricket, badminton, any sport... we play it all in the room,"" Shyam, who couldn’t travel to Montenegro to witness his student clinch the World Junior Chess Championship title due to visa issues, toldduring an exclusive conversation.Pranav’s journey to becoming the junior world chess champion, interestingly, began on a cricket field a year ago.Shyam, who runs his chess academy, Chess Thulir , in Chennai near Perambur, often plays cricket with his students to bond with them and keep them physically active.""Pranav came to play cricket a few times, just like any other teenager,"" Shyam recalled with a chuckle. ""Back then, he wasn’t even training for chess with me.""But that soon changed.Though he had trained with other coaches in the past, it was only after his father approached Shyam that their serious chess journey began.""We started working together officially around January last year,"" Shyam noted. ""By then, Pranav was already a grandmaster. But my goal was to take him to the next level.""Thus began a year of intense training, where Shyam sought to balance Pranav’s natural skill in fast-paced formats like rapid and blitz with the endurance needed for longer, more gruelling classical games.""It’s like T20 cricket versus Test cricket,"" Shyam explained. ""You can hit the ball out of the park in T20, but in Test cricket, you need patience to play the long game. Similarly, in chess, Pranav was brilliant at quick formats, but I wanted him to master the longer formats too.""Pranav, already recognised for his acumen in blitz games — having even defeated top players like Magnus Carlsen in online matches — had to channel his instinct for speed into a more methodical approach.However, the transition wasn’t easy.""Initially, it took some time. We worked together for two months, and then he went to Spain to play a few events. It didn’t go well, which was expected because I need time to understand any player I work with. The first few months are always a process of trial and error — getting to know their psychology and approach. So, the first two or three months didn’t go very well,"" Shyam told. ""Once I started to know him much better, it went very well. He was winning events like the Dubai Police Championship and Sharjah Masters.""These victories, though impressive, were just the beginning.By December 2024, Pranav had qualified for the prestigious Chennai Masters Tournament after winning the Chennai Challenges Invitational.It was at this event that the coach-player duo cemented their unique pre-match routine, which included playing cricket in hotel rooms to relax before a match.“We used to play cricket in the room with a bottle cap, stress balls, whatever was available,” Shyam said, laughing. “The idea was to keep Pranav relaxed.”READ ALSO: 'A big step forward for women': World No. 8 Anna Muzychuk on equal prize in Norway Chess | Exclusive Pranav, a boy of few words, has remained humble throughout this period. With no presence on social media, he is managed well by his father, Venkatesh, who often travels with him to different countries for tournaments.Shyam, being a grandmaster himself, was not unaware that the pressure was mounting on Pranav, especially as he prepared for his ultimate challenge: the 2025 World Junior U20 Chess Championship in Petrovac, Montenegro.As the tournament neared, preparing for the tournament was getting tricky. ""Just before the tournament, we had a few online sessions. Initially, we had planned to play different openings,"" Shyam admitted. ""But it wasn’t just a rigid plan A, B, or C. Plan A didn’t feel quite right, so we adjusted. What was originally Plan B and C became Plan A.""But as the tournament kicked off, Shyam reflected, ""He started strong, and once he took a one-point lead, he maintained it and converted his chances well.""His final-round draw against Matic Lavrencic, securing a score of 9/11, sealed the victory and solidified Pranav’s status as one of the brightest young stars in the chess world.“I spoke to him after the final round,” Shyam recalled, his voice filled with pride. ""He was always confident. He told me, 'Come on, don't you know this is my kind of position? How could I mess this up?'""But for Shyam, the nerves were unavoidable. “During the last round, I was so anxious that I went to the temple. I had to switch off the internet, of course. After coming out, I turned my data back on, and there it was—he messaged, 'I won the tournament.' I just thought, 'Thank God!'”Winning the World Junior Chess Championship — a title previously held by none other than Viswanathan Anand — has been the summit of Pranav's career so far.The journey, however, wasn’t just about winning.It was about the bond built over shared games of cricket, the relentless training, and the mutual respect between coach and student.""We speak the same regional language — Tamil — so we get along very well. We crack jokes, and he's like an innocent kid. He doesn’t have many distractions,"" said the 32-year-old coach. ""It’s a good relationship. He watches a lot of comedy movies, so we use movie references while joking.""As Pranav stood on the podium in Montenegro, a smile on his face, trophy in hand, he looked back — not just at the hours spent hunched over a chessboard, but also at those moments in hotel rooms, where the sound of a bottle cap hitting the wall did little to disturb others.","Pranav Venkatesh, 18, is the junior world chess champion. His coach, GM Shyam Sundar M, often plays cricket with his students to bond with them and keep them physically active. Cricket, often seen by Shyam as a break from the mental grind, has become part of Pranav's preparation routine for chess.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118808711,imgsize-88916,width-400,resizemode-4/118808711.jpg"

Shubman Gill on future of Rohit Sharma, approach, Champions Trophy final

Team India gears up for Champions Trophy final with practice in Dubai

""Macha come for five minutes na... ,"" Harshit Rana pleaded with Washington Sundar to join their team, which was a player short, for a game of foot-volley at the Dubai International Stadium . Sundar, an off-spinner, was lazing around on the greens after sipping coconut water and was in no mood to become the replacement for Virat Kohli , who left his team midway through the game to join head coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma for a discussion near the playing square.The three stood there and made plans for what to do on Sunday for nearly 20 minutes. The hand gestures, Rohit's shadow batting and Kohli pointing to different areas on the field suggested there was plenty of plans being made. Not long after, light fielding drills took over. It was by no means an intense outing under the unforgiving sun as the entire bunch just got a feel of the afternoon, had a very brief team meeting, some stars signed for the waiting fans before everyone made their way back to the team hotel.The eve of the match, however, wasn't that brief an affair for both the captain and vice-captain ( Shubman Gill ) as the two didn't travel with the rest of the team to the stadium and were instead sweating it out at the International Cricket Council (ICC) Academy in the morning hours.With batting coach Sitanshu Kotak, assistant coach Abhishek Nayar and throwdown specialists for company, the openers trained for around an hour before joining the rest of the team. Even when the rumour mill is working overtime on the future of India captain, Rohit has his eyes on the prize - an ICC ODI title.There was a lot of purpose in his movements and discussions during the practice session on March 7 too as there is unfinished business for the Men in Blue. Most were part of the November 19 heartbreak vs Australia and the March 9 fixture, against New Zealand in the Champions Trophy, presents an opportunity for the ageing superstars, in the last leg of their respective careers, to add an ICC winners medal to their cabinet. There is an eye on the present but ears are firmly planted on the future too. Mohammed Shami (34), Ravindra Jadeja (36), Kohli (36) and Rohit (37) are not getting any younger and this could well be the last time the quartet feature together in an ICC ODI tournament. The next World Cup is still a couple of years away and it sounds like a stretch at this stage.Kohli, Rohit and Jadeja announced retirement from T20Is after the World Cup win in 2024 and there could be some decisions, if not announcements, in store after the Champions Trophy concludes on Sunday. If India have to make the roadmap for the 2027 World Cup, it has to start immediately after the Champions Trophy and some tough calls need to be taken.The timing to initiate the transition in ODIs is ideal and it could well not be dependent on the outcome of the Champions Trophy final. Vice-captain Gill, whose elevation is the step in the transition direction, asserted that there are no such discussions in the change room and the final clash vs the Black Caps remains the centre of attention at this stage.""No sir, till now we have only been discussing about winning the match, winning the Champions Trophy. He has not spoken to me or to the team about this decision. I don't think Rohit is thinking about it,"" says Gill at the pre-match press conference.Will-he-won't-he has been the repeated statement since the multi-nation tournament got underway in Dubai and the chatter grew louder on eve of the title clash. There was extra attention on his movements, routines on Saturday but the captain, for now, has his eyes firmly locked on the prize - the ICC Champions Trophy","India face New Zealand in the ICC Champions Trophy final on Sunday. Captain Rohit Sharma and vice-captain Shubman Gill trained at the International Cricket Council (ICC) Academy in the morning hours.

His standout performance came against Pakistan, where he scored an unbeaten 100 and took two catches, earning him the Player of the Match accolade.

Additionally, Kohli has been sharp in the field, securing seven catches.Iyer has been a model of consistency, accumulating 195 runs with an average of 48.75. His pivotal 79-run innings against New Zealand stabilised India's position after early setbacks. Beyond his batting prowess, Iyer's agility in the field was highlighted by a direct-hit run-out of Australia's Alex Carey in the semi-final.Making a significant impact in his debut ODI tournament at 33, Chakravarthy has taken seven wickets in two matches, averaging 13.00. His remarkable 5/42 against New Zealand was instrumental in securing India's top spot in Group A. He further showcased his skill with a 2/49 spell against Australia, including the crucial dismissal of opener Travis Head.Shami's experience has been invaluable, claiming eight wickets with an average of 19.88. His 5/53 against Bangladesh demonstrated his enduring prowess, and his 3/48 in the semi-final against Australia, including the key wicket of Steve Smith, highlighted his knack for delivering in high-stakes situations.Henry has reinforced his reputation as a dependable fast bowler, taking ten wickets in four matches at an average of 16.70 and an economy rate of 5.32. His 5/42 against India in the group stage was a testament to his ability to disrupt even the most formidable batting lineups.Leading by example, captain Santner has taken seven wickets with an economy rate of 4.85. His semi-final performance against South Africa was pivotal, as he dismissed key players Temba Bavuma, Rassie van der Dussen, and Heinrich Klaasen, steering his team toward victory.Williamson's composure and skill have been evident, scoring 189 runs at an average of 47.25. His century (102) in the semi-final against South Africa was a masterclass in batting under pressure. Defensively, his seven catches, including two against Bangladesh, have been crucial in New Zealand's campaign.Ravindra's all-round capabilities have shone brightly. In three matches, he has scored 226 runs and taken two wickets. His semi-final performance against South Africa, featuring a 108-run innings, a wicket for 20 runs, and two catches, earned him the Player of the Match award. His initial 112 against Bangladesh was instrumental in New Zealand's recovery from an early collapse.Phillips has been a dynamic force, scoring 143 runs and taking two wickets. His explosive 49 off 27 balls against South Africa in the semi-final set a formidable target. He further contributed with two wickets and a catch, dismantling South Africa's middle order and propelling New Zealand into the final.Omarzai has been a standout for Afghanistan, scoring 126 runs and taking seven wickets. His five-wicket haul against England, including the dismissals of key players like Joe Root and Jos Buttler, was central to Afghanistan's eight-run victory. His batting contributions, including a swift 67 off 63 balls against Australia, further highlight his all-round value.",ICC unveils ten nominees for Player of the Tournament award.

SPURS BEATEN; ROMA, LYON WIN

Real Sociedad and Manchester United played a 1-1 draw in their Europa League last-16 first leg encounter on Thursday in San Sebastian, while Tottenham Hotspur went down 1-0 to AZ Alkmaar.United took the lead when Joshua Zirkzee struck from outside the box in the 57th minute, but Mikel Oyarzabal equalised from a penalty after Bruno Fernandes was penalised for handling the ball.The match followed a difficult period for Zirkzee, who had missed the crucial penalty in the FA Cup shootout defeat to Fulham the previous week. His challenging debut season at United continues, with the club's sole remaining chance for a trophy now resting in the Europa League competition.He found the back of the net for his first European goal this season, delivering a precise low shot from 20 yards following Alejandro Garnacho's well-placed pass.However, Ruben Amorim's team lost their lead when Fernandes committed a handball during a corner, resulting in Oyarzabal successfully converting the penalty.Andre Onana maintained parity with two outstanding saves as Real Sociedad sought a winning goal, setting up an balanced contest for next week's return fixture.An unfortunate first-half own goal by Lucas Bergvall resulted in Spurs' defeat in the Netherlands. The scoreline could have been more severe for Ange Postecoglou's team if not for Guglielmo Vicario's three excellent saves.Tottenham's troubles deepened when Dominic Solanke left the pitch with an injury after 20 minutes, cutting short his comeback from a seven-week knee injury layoff.Rangers secured a notable 3-1 victory on their visit to Fenerbahce, managed by Jose Mourinho.The Scottish side took an early advantage through Cyriel Dessers in Istanbul, though Alexander Djiku equalised for the Turkish team.Rangers, led by temporary manager Barry Ferguson, strengthened their position when Vaclav Cerny scored twice, including a goal nine minutes before the final whistle.Lyon made significant progress towards reaching the quarterfinals by securing a 3-1 win against Romanian side FCSB.There was an emotional moment when Nicolas Tagliafico scored, as Paulo Fonseca, who received a dugout ban until November from French football authorities following a heated exchange with a referee, became tearful whilst celebrating with his squad.After Alexandru Baluta had drawn FCSB level, Malick Fofana secured the victory for Lyon by scoring twice in the closing stages.In Italy, Uzbek striker Eldor Shomurodov delivered a dramatic finish, scoring with the last kick to give AS Roma a 2-1 triumph over Athletic Bilbao in their opening leg encounter.Paulo Dybala struck the crossbar for Roma before Inaki Williams put Athletic ahead with a header. Angelino equalised for the home side, and Shomurodov secured the victory after Athletic had a player dismissed.Lazio secured a dramatic victory at Viktoria Plzen, winning 2-1 despite being reduced to nine players, with Gustav Isaksen scoring in the 98th minute.The Italian side took the lead through Alessio Romagnoli, but Plzen equalised after half-time. Lazio subsequently lost Nicolo Rovella and Samuel Gigot to red cards before Isaksen's decisive goal.At Ajax, Eintracht Frankfurt recovered from a deficit to win 2-1, with Hugo Larsson and Ellyes Skhiri scoring after Brian Brobbey's 10th-minute opener.In another match, Bodo/Glimt defeated Olympiakos 3-0 at home, with Kasper Hogh scoring twice.","Manchester United and Real Sociedad play out 1-1 draw in Europa League last-16 first leg.

King Kohli's masterclass puts India in final | IND vs AUS | ICC Champions Trophy 2025

Gautam Gambhir hits out at critics after India beat Australia to reach Champions Trophy final

: Karachi to Rawalpindi to Dubai to Lahore to back in Dubai. Last few weeks have seen New Zealand play their four Champions Trophy fixtures at four different venues and they have only lost one game - to India in Dubai. Three days after losing the game, the Black Caps have landed in Dubai again to prepare for the title clash of the multi-nation tournament on March 9 The two top sides in the tournament have had a contrasting journey to the final as New Zealand acclimitised to different conditions for all their games and India were parked in Dubai since February 15, and played all their fixtures at the Dubai International Stadium.Even in their only defeat, the Mitchell Santner-led unit posed a stiff challenge for India but fell short of the target by 44 runs. Unbeaten India have managed to tick most of the boxes in their outings but they will have to be wary of the Kiwis who are the most prepared team in the competition , and will definitely have a score to settle on Sunday. They have encountered different challenges at different venues and have come out on top in spite of the non-stop travel, and have excelled in the art of adapting to different conditions.They did put India under the pump early in the group stage contest but a solid repair job and late flourish meant there were just enough runs for the spin quartet of Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel and Varun Chakravarthy to defend. Varun, who picked a fifer on his maiden outing in the tournament, tormented the opposition batters but they did put up a fight and had Kane Williamson, 81, got some support from the other end, it could have been a much closer contest.On paper, very little separates the two teams as they have a very similar make-up of the Playing XI and there is no dearth of experience in both camps. If India have the potent spin quartet, Santner has Rachin Ravindra, Michael Bracewell and even Glenn Phillips to play the support cast. And as far as quicks are concerned, New Zealand definitely hold the edge as spin-heavy approach means India are reliant on Mohammed Shami to do the heavy lifting and only has Hardik Pandya to do the support job.More than the similar makeup and ability to seamlessly adapt, what would make India wary of New Zealand is the fact that they will for the first time play an opposition which has had a recent taste of Dubai conditions. The conditions which have been on the sluggish side and favoured spin. Yes, the seamers - Shami and Matt Henry - have enjoyed success but the slower bowlers have had a bigger impact on the match.New Zealand have embraced the challenges without any complaints and have set-up a mouth-watering repeat of the 2000 edition of the Champions Trophy. Senior batter Kane Williamson said the team will take learnings from their last meeting into the final, and reiterated that anything can happen in the final.""India are an outstanding team and is playing really well. So, look, it's important we try and take away some learnings from that last game. Park this match, and in a final, anything can happen. And it was a great atmosphere last game and I'm sure it'll be a good one again,"" said Williamson after the win over South Africa in the semis.On the expected lines, Williamson was asked a familiar question on the advantage India have of playing at the same venue. The experienced campaigner responded with the straight bat and chose to focus on the cricket they wish to play in the title clash.""I suppose having played there on a number of occasions; there's real clarity in how they want to operate. A little bit like our opportunity here, having played a number of times at this venue as well and I think that's part and parcel in cricket. So, it's just not something we're really looking too closely at. It's about the cricket that we want to play and take into account, obviously, the opposition, but be nice and smart come that final,"" added Williamson.New Zealand have few more days to do what they have seamlessly managed in the tournament so far - acclimitise and take the challenge head on.","New Zealand face India in the Champions Trophy final on March 9.

Chelsea advanced towards the UEFA Conference League quarter-finals with a 2-1 victory at Copenhagen on Thursday in their last 16 tie's first leg, whilst Panathinaikos and Fiorentina engaged in an intense five-goal contest.The visitors secured their advantage through second-half goals from Reece James and Enzo Fernandez, before Gabriel Pereira reduced the margin for the home side, as Enzo Maresca's team secured a narrow advantage in Denmark's capital.After a lacklustre first half, Chelsea captain James opened the scoring moments after the interval, receiving Marc Cucurella's deep pass before placing a long-range shot inside the near post.The match intensified following the goal, with Copenhagen nearly equalising immediately when Viktor Claesson's one-on-one attempt struck the inside of Robert Sanchez's post before rebounding into the keeper's hands.Substitute Fernandez secured a second goal for the visitors in the 65th minute, finishing decisively after impressive build-up play from young Tyrique George.The Premier League club appeared in control until Pereira found space in the penalty area to head in from a set-piece with 11 minutes remaining.Also, Panathinaikos secured a 3-2 victory against previous season's runners-up Fiorentina.Panathinaikos established an early dominance with Karol Swiderski and Nemanja Maksimovic scoring within the first 19 minutes, creating a 2-0 advantage. Fiorentina responded swiftly, with Lucas Beltran and Nicolo Fagioli scoring in quick succession to equalise the score.Tete secured the winning goal for the home side with a precise left-footed shot in the 55th minute, giving them an advantage before the return fixture.In Norway, Molde secured a 3-2 victory against Legia Warsaw.

Devon Conway - the dark horse

New Zealand will look to play their cards more smartly in the match that matters, the Champions trophy final against India on Sunday, having experienced the spin-heavy strategy employed by Rohit Sharma & Co during their group-stage encounter. However, there's more than one thing about the Kiwis that India too must be wary of.Former India batter Ambati Rayudu gave a lowdown on the players that may trouble India in the title clash.Speaking about the big game in a Star Sports video, Rayudu said: ""We have to be very, very wary of three players.""New Zealand's bowling attack has revolved around the left-arm spin of captain Mitchell Santner, more so in Dubai than at the three batting-friendly venues in Pakistan. He showed that during his crafty spell in the semi-final against South Africa in Lahore, where he choked the Proteas with his 3 for 43 in the middle overs of their chase.While Santner's seven wickets in four matches may not appear a menacing stat, it's his economy rate of 4.85 runs that resembles the kind of web Indian spinners have tangled the opposition batters into. He will be even more important if tournament's top wicket-taker, fast bowler Matt Henry, doesn't recover from his shoulder injury to play the final.With two centuries in three matches, top-order batter Rachin Ravindra remains the biggest threat for the Indian bowlers. His 226 runs in three matches at an average of 75.33 has propped up the Kiwi batting line-up.The challenge for him will be to navigate through the quartet of Indian spinners in Dubai, especially considering his failure in the group-stage match against the Indian team, scoring just six runs before being dismissed by Hardik Pandya.Interestingly, Rayudu predicted Conway's return to the playing eleven in the final and warned India to not overlook the left-handed batter's attacking skills.He played New Zealand's first two matches of this Champions Trophy against Pakistan and Bangladesh, scoring 10 and 30 respectively. The opener has remained out of the playing eleven since then, with the Kiwis opting to open with Will Young and Ravindra in the subsequent group match against India and the semifinal against South Africa.",New Zealand take on India in the Champions Trophy final on Sunday. Ambati Rayudu says the Kiwis must be wary of three players.

FIFA to consider expanding World Cup to 64 teams,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/fifa-to-consider-expanding-world-cup-to-64-teams/articleshow/118772103.cms,"FIFA World Cup trophy (Agency Photo)

(This article originally appeared in The New York Times)

FIFA, the governing body for global football , is considering a plan that would increase the number of teams in the 2030 World Cup to 64 for a one-off expansion to mark the centenary of the event, the organization said on Thursday.The proposal, which was made toward the end of a FIFA board meeting on Wednesday, would upend a tournament that already figures to be unwieldy and complicated because it will be played across three continents for the first time.The World Cup is the most lucrative and most watched event in sports, bringing in billions for FIFA, but the coveted nature of the competition has led to battles among nations to host it, as well as widespread allegations in the past of corruption.The decision to award the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia was criticized by good governance organizations, after FIFA changed its own rules to allow the country to effectively secure rights without facing any competition.The FIFA president, Gianni Infantino , has already overseen the expansion of the World Cup once during his nine-year tenure, bringing the number of teams up to 48 from 32 at the next edition in 2026, which will be mostly played in the United States but also include matches in Mexico and Canada.According to four people with direct knowledge of the discussions, the proposal for a 64-team tournament came as the meeting was drawing to a close and had reached the section of the agenda earmarked for ""miscellaneous"" issues.At that point, a delegate from Uruguay, Ignacio Alonso, made the proposal, reading a prepared speech in English.Three of the people with knowledge of the meeting, which was held via video, described the reaction from others present as stunned silence, and the proposals will almost certainly be met with a huge outcry.But they cautioned that FIFA was likely to be guided by financial and political benefits as much as sporting ones when it came to making a decision.Infantino, who has expanded his influence over the organization and the sport since he become the head of FIFA, acknowledged the proposal and said it should be analyzed more closely, according to the four people.Since assuming the highest office in global football, Infantino has made several attempts to reshape the sport, efforts that have often led to public disputes with many other prominent figures in the football world.A proposal to analyze a 64-team World Cup to celebrate the centenary of the event ""was spontaneously raised by a FIFA Council member in the 'miscellaneous' agenda item near the end"" of a board meeting, FIFA said in a statement after The New York Times first published details of the discussions.""The idea was acknowledged as FIFA has a duty to analyze any proposal from one of its council members,"" the statement added.The last time FIFA considered a major change to the World Cup, staging the event every two years instead of four, it formed a committee that worked on the project for a year before quietly mothballing the idea.Expanding the World Cup to 64 teams -- more than a quarter of FIFA's overall membership -- could render many of the regional qualification competitions for the event meaningless.Already, as many as seven teams out of 10 from South America can qualify for the 2026 World Cup, and further expanding the World Cup could reduce its appeal for broadcasters.There are also significant logistical issues. The tournament, with 32 teams, already takes about a month and would almost certainly run longer in an expanded format. The 48-team tournament in 2026 will feature a record 104 games.Under Infantino, FIFA has been constantly exploring ways to alter its marquee event, efforts that have usually been met with blowback from other parts of the football industry.On Wednesday, FIFA announced a collaboration with the British rock band Coldplay to put together a halftime show for the first time at a World Cup final when it is played in New Jersey next summer.The move is similar to what the NFL does with the Super Bowl, its showpiece event, but the announcement was greeted with yet more criticism.At one point, Infantino supported the effort to play the World Cup every two years rather than four, and a furious reaction -- largely from European football's governing body -- forced backers of the idea to shelve it.Saudi Arabia secured its event after FIFA announced that Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina would join Morocco, Spain and Portugal in hosting matches for the 2030 tournament, narrowing the field for potential future hosts in 2034.The three South American nations were awarded one game each to commemorate the centenary of the tournament, which was first played in Uruguay in 1930.The expansion proposal comes amid regional frustration at automatic places for the three South American hosts for the 2030 World Cup -- particularly Paraguay, home of the regional confederation president, which has failed in recent attempts to qualify for the World Cup.Infantino secured the FIFA presidency in 2016 after a corruption scandal that led to the ouster of most of its previous leadership.He ran on a campaign of promising more funds to FIFA's 211 members and a promise to increase the size of the World Cup. Infantino now spends most of his time in Miami and has grown close to President Donald Trump, who recently described the FIFA president, whom he invited to his inauguration, as the ""king of soccer.""Infantino has spent most of his time in his office devising ways to leave a lasting legacy. As well as expanding the World Cup for both men and women, he has created a new World Cup for club teams that will be staged for the first time this summer in the United States.Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump took part in the draw that set up the competitions matchups at an event in Miami late last year.The new club competition is facing several headwinds, including sluggish ticket sales in the United States and a dispute with leagues and player unions, which have filed legal complaints in Europe.","FIFA considering a plan to increase the number of teams in the 2030 World Cup to 64.

Virat Kohli steers India to third consecutive Champions Trophy final

Gautam Gambhir hits out at critics after India beat Australia to reach Champions Trophy final

In a team where most of India’s top guns are firing away, he has quietly delivered the goods. In a campaign where all talk has revolved around India’s spinners, the superlative comebacks of Mohammed Shami from injury and Virat Kohli from poor form, the sizzling batting of Shubman Gill, skipper Rohit Sharma, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul, what a consistent Hardik Pandya has brought to the team has found little or no word in edgewise.Hardly surprising, but not anymore. In Tuesday’s semifinal against Australia, walking in with India delicately placed at 225/5, having just lost the Virat Kohli for 84, Pandya turned the 265-run chase into a walk in the park.He unleashed three big sixes, beginning with a 106-m monster hit off Tanveer Sangha followed by back-to-back sixes off Adam Zampa. He eventually holed out to pacer Nathan Ellis, but the 31-year-old’s entertaining 24-ball 28 had done the job – swinging it decisively India’s way. Earlier, opening the bowling with Shami, Pandya ran into a belligerent Travis Head, but did well to hold his own. All he allowed Head was one run in his first over, before the attacking left-hander took his chances.“I thought his contributions against Pakistan and New Zealand were crucial too. He struck some lusty blows and made a few important breakthroughs,” ex-chairman of selector Kiran More told TOI from Baroda — the cricketing centre where the former India wicketkeeper trained the Pandya brothers, Hardik and Krunal at his academy.Against Pakistan, Pandya accounted for Babar Azam and a well-set Saud Shakeel while conceding just 31 off eight, and New Zealand saw him score a quickfire 45 off 45 balls, and then watched as he claimed the dangerous Rachin Ravindra while giving away 22 in four overs. Indeed, it is the sight of Pandya walking in at No. 7 that makes India such a formidable force here.For those from a generation back, it’s just the kind of strength that Australia would boast of in Tests in the early 2000s, when the legendary ’keeper-bat Adam Gilchrist would come in at that slot and destroy tiring bowling attacks.Against New Zealand in the final on Sunday night in Dubai, expect Pandya to again hold the key, both with ball and bat. It forces the mind back to the 2023 ODI World Cup, when he was ruled out after an ankle injury midway through the tournament. Would Pandya’s presence then have helped India get past eventual champions Australia in that final at Ahmedabad? Of course, the answer remains in the realm of imagination — that eternal ‘what if’ — but he certainly would have made a big difference.It is the presence of a player of his versatility, someone who can open the bowling as a reliable seamer and bat effectively at No. 7, that is allowing India the luxury of playing four spinners in Dubai.Bouncing back after a poor IPL last season, where he was skipper in Mumbai Indians’ poorest outing – finishing last after losing 10 matches and winning a mere four – and living through the ignominy of being booed by the Wankhede Stadium crowd, he played a stellar role in India’s T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies and the US in June 2024. He took 11 wickets at 17.36, and chipping in with 144 runs with a strike rate of 151.57.Apparently being formed for white-ball captaincy, having led India’s T20 team since Jan 2023, Pandya was suddenly replaced by Suryakumar Yadav as T20 captain, and Shubman Gill overtook him as the ODI vice-captain. A demotion of this nature could have shaken up anyone, but Pandya simply sported his trademark shrug and shook off the setback. Today, he looks as happy as ever in the India dugout, amply evident with the way he hugged Virat Kohli and his other India teammates after India made the final.“He’s a lion-hearted cricketer. For the last six-seven months, it’s evident that he’s just enjoying his cricket. He is not someone who will hold grudges against anyone. Maaf karta hai aur chal deta hai (he forgives, forgets and moves on),” More said.","Hardik Pandya has quietly delivered the goods for India.

Shubman Gill on future of Rohit Sharma, approach, Champions Trophy final

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan pacer Junaid Khan has stirred controversy ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy final by accusing India of benefiting from a favourable scheduling.Taking to X, Junaid on Saturday pointed out the significant travel distances for teams in the tournament, contrasting them with India's stationary campaign in Dubai.“Distance traveled between matches in Champions Trophy 2025:New Zealand: 7,150 KMSouth Africa: 3,286 KMIndia: 0 KMSome teams win by skill, some win by scheduling...,” Junaid posted, implying that India's lack of travel provided them with an unfair advantage.Earlier, India head coach Gautam Gambhir dismissed these allegations, calling them baseless.Speaking after India’s four-wicket win over Australia in the semifinals, Gambhir retorted, “What undue advantage? We practice at ICC Academy, where conditions are different from the stadium. Some people are perpetual cribbers; they need to grow up.”Despite the noise surrounding their schedule, India remain focused on the task ahead.

Team India gears up for Champions Trophy final with practice in Dubai

NEW DELHI: Former wicketkeeper-batter Syed Kirmani has expressed his opinion that experienced fast bowler Mohammed Shami should disregard the criticism he has received for not fasting during Ramadan in the semi-final match between India and Australia.This critique came to the forefront when All India Muslim Jamaat President Maulana Shahabuddin Razvi Bareilvi labelled Shami ""a criminal"" for his actions during Ramadan. During the semi-final held at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium , Shami was observed consuming an energy drink.Kirmani advocates for players to concentrate on their game rather than succumbing to external pressures and criticisms.""They are all playing for the country. There's no doubt that it's Ramzan. There are a lot of criticisms. We give our lives for the country, to raise the flag of the country. Whatever people say, they keep saying it. There are a lot of criticisms on everyone, depending on the situation,"" Kirmani told ANI.""Absolutely, absolutely. Nothing, nothing, nothing. Just keep listening from one ear and take it out from the other. If you take criticism, you'll be under more pressure. Whatever is written, whatever is said, you don't have to worry about it. You just have to keep yourself under control and play for the country.""Supporting Shami, his cousin Mumtaz defended him by highlighting that playing for the country is the priority and criticized the backlash as ""shameful.""""He is playing for the country. There are many Pakistani players who have not kept 'Roza' and are playing matches, so this is nothing new. It is very shameful that such things are being said about him. We will tell Mohammed Shami not to pay attention to these things and prepare for the match on March 9,"" Mumtaz noted.In the tournament, Shami has been a key player for India, securing eight wickets in four matches with an average of 19.88, and his performance has been instrumental in India's success, marking him as the second-highest wicket-taker so far.","Former wicketkeeper-batter Syed Kirmani says Mohammed Shami should disregard criticism.

‘This is the best batting line up I am part of’

'We are hungry, but not desperate for title'

Team India gears up for Champions Trophy final with practice in Dubai

DUBAI: In the lead-up to the ICC Men's Champions Trophy 2025 final between India and New Zealand at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday, there has been intense speculation in the media regarding captain Rohit Sharma 's international future. There is talk that the 37-year-old might even announce his retirement after the summit clash. However, on Saturday, on the eve of the final, Indian vice-captain Shubman Gill clarified that there had been no communication or talk between Rohit and the team yet on this issue.Gill, who has formed a formidable opening partnership with Rohit over the last few years in the ODIs, said Rohit is not focusing on anything other than winning the Champions Trophy at the moment. The 25-year-old said that all the talk in the Indian dressing room has been about how the side can down the Black Caps and win the Champions Trophy. “We have not discussed it. All the chatter and the discussion are about winning the match. And what we have to do to win the match, All our discussions have been about winning the final and the title. The team and I have not been told anything about this decision. Rohit Bhai would not be thinking about it at the moment. I think once the match ends tomorrow, he will make a decision. There is no talk about it within the setup,"" Gill told reporters.However, before could interpret his statement differently, he later clarified his statement on his captain by saying, “Till now, we have only been discussing winning the final and the Champions Trophy. He (Rohit) has not spoken to me or to the team about this decision. I don't think Rohit is thinking about it.”In the 2025 Champions Trophy, Rohit has made scores of 41,20,15 and 28, aggregating 104 runs in four matches. Before the eight-team tournament, Rohit returned to form in the second ODI of the three-match series against England at Cuttack, scoring his 32dn ODI century (119).Meanwhile, Gill said that feels privileged to be a part of India’s ""best batting line-up,"" and credited the depth in the order, which he felt allowed the top three to go for their shots freely. “This is the best batting line up I am part of. Rohit is one of the best openers (in the world) and Virat, we need not tell about him. But our team has depth in batting and that allows the top order to bat with a bit more freedom,” he said.The opener said that he was aware of the massive pressure on Team India to win the trophy but exuded confidence that the side will come up trumps unlike the 2023 ODI World Cup, which they lost to Australia in the final at Ahmedabad. “We are all excited for the final. Last time we could not win the 50 over World Cup but we are determined to win this time. There will be big match pressure. But whichever team deals with pressure will win the final. We just need to take it like any other match, and good teams will do that. We have played four matches here and done well, so there is no added pressure on us,” Gill said.Gill said that India's triumph in the T20 World Cup in June last year in the West Indies, which ended a barren 11-year run of a World Cup trophy, had taken the pressure off his team and allowed them to play the big matches like Sunday's final without getting overwhelmed by the occasion.""Sometimes once you get one title, I think that kind of breaks the jinx. It gives you the momentum, also you are not very desperate about getting the title. It's not good when desperation kicks in. Then it becomes hard to put the occasion out of the equation. In all these big matches, the players or the teams that can put aside the pressure and take the occasion out of the game have a better chance of winning. I think winning the title in 2024 doesn't mean that we are less hungry but I think it makes us more balanced that yes we've won an ICC title and we'll try to do our best to win this one,"" Gill explained.","India face New Zealand in the ICC Men's Champions Trophy 2025 final on Sunday. Vice-captain Shubman Gill says there has been no talk about captain Rohit Sharma's future.

Team India gears up for Champions Trophy final with practice in Dubai

Gautam Gambhir chases history! India coach targets maiden ICC trophy in first final

NEW DELHI: India vice-captain Shubman Gill admitted that there is ""big match pressure"" ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy final against New Zealand but expressed confidence in India's ability to handle it and claim the coveted title.""The big-match pressure is always there. The last time (2023) we couldn't do it, but we will try to do it this time. In a big match, the team that takes the pressure out of the equation has a better chance of winning,"" Gill said in the pre-match press conference on Saturday.He pointed to cricket's greatest teams to highlight the importance of handling pressure in knockout games.""This is the reason why we talk about big teams of previous years, including West Indies and Australia. Those teams played their best cricket in knockouts and used to take out pressure from the big-match equation. Easier said than done, but good teams play their best cricket under pressure,"" he added.While India has played four matches at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium , including a victory over New Zealand, Gill downplayed any advantage.""We have played four matches here and done really well. But I think the last time we played NZ, despite losing three wickets early, we played a good match and won comfortably. So I don't think there is any added discussion. Obviously, someone in the top 3-5 firing would give us a better chance to chase a big total or put up a big total.""Gill also noted the nature of the Dubai pitch, saying it will influence strategy.""The kind of wicket we will play on would be the discussion. We have not seen a 300-plus total here. The wickets we are playing on are quite different from the ones in Pakistan,"" he explained.India broke a long ICC trophy drought by winning the 2024 T20 World Cup , and Gill believes that triumph has given the team momentum and mental clarity.""Once you get one title, it gives you momentum. You are not very desperate about getting the title. It's not good when desperation kicks in.""However, he made it clear that the hunger to win more ICC trophies remains.""Winning the title in 2024 doesn't mean we are less hungry, but it kind of gives us more balance that we have won an ICC title, and we will try to do our best to win this one,"" he said.","India vice-captain Shubman Gill admits there is ""big match pressure"" ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy final against New Zealand.

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has hit back at a social media (X) account user for falsely attributing a quote to him regarding the retirement plans of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma . As Team India gears up for the Champions Trophy 2025 final against New Zealand, scheduled for Sunday, speculation around the future of the two senior stars has been a hot topic.Kohli and Rohit, who already announced their T20I retirements after India's 2024 T20 World Cup triumph, have played a crucial role in India’s unbeaten run in the Champions Trophy. While Kohli has delivered match-winning knocks against Pakistan and Australia, Rohit has provided fiery starts, setting the tone for India’s batting.Amid the buzz, an X user shared a fake quote allegedly from Ashwin’s YouTube channel, stating that Rohit was targeting the 2027 ODI World Cup while Kohli might retire soon to spend more time with his family. The misleading post quickly gained traction, prompting Ashwin to step in and clarify.Taking to X, the off-spinner sarcastically responded, ""Heartwarming to see humans still excelling at creative storytelling in this AI era. Nice script but maybe check with me next time before casting me in the lead role?""Ashwin's witty reply put an end to the false claims, reinforcing the importance of verifying information before spreading it.

League leaders Liverpool secured a 3-1 victory against bottom-placed Southampton, with Mohamed Salah converting two penalties, while Nottingham Forest achieved a significant 1-0 triumph over Manchester City to boost their Champions League aspirations.Liverpool extended their advantage at the summit to 16 points, despite an underwhelming first-half display. Following their successful 1-0 Champions League win against Paris Saint-Germain, Liverpool manager Arne Slot selected three different players but was forced to make three substitutions at half-time to revitalise his team.Despite Southampton amassing merely nine points from 28 fixtures this season, they surprised Anfield when Will Smallbone scored just before the break. A miscommunication between Alisson Becker and Virgil van Dijk allowed Smallbone to tap into an empty net.Slot responded by introducing Harvey Elliott, Alexis MacAllister, and Andy Robertson after the interval, which resulted in two goals within three minutes before the hour mark. Darwin Nunez equalised with a well-taken finish from Luis Diaz’s delivery, before Salah converted a penalty after Nunez was fouled in the box. The Egyptian striker sealed the win with another spot-kick two minutes before full-time, bringing his season’s goal tally to 32.Arsenal, in second place, have two matches in hand over the leaders, starting with Sunday’s away fixture at Manchester United. Liverpool appear destined to secure their second league championship in 35 years.Elsewhere, Nottingham Forest opened a four-point gap over third-placed City after Callum Hudson-Odoi’s late winner at the City Ground. The former Chelsea winger beat Ederson with seven minutes remaining, courtesy of Morgan Gibbs-White’s assist, sparking celebrations as Forest defeated the English champions for the first time since 1997.The two-time European champions have not played in the continent’s elite club competition since 1980 but are edging closer to qualification. A top-five finish may be enough due to English teams’ strong European performances this season.City remain in fourth place, vulnerable after suffering their ninth league defeat of the campaign. Pep Guardiola’s side now face the prospect of being overtaken by Chelsea, who host struggling Leicester on Sunday.Crystal Palace overcame Jean-Philippe Mateta’s serious ear injury to defeat Ipswich 1-0, courtesy of Ismaila Sarr’s strike.

Nottingham Forest dealt a major blow to Manchester City's Champions League hopes as Callum Hudson-Odoi struck late to secure a 1-0 victory in Saturday’s top-four clash at the City Ground.City’s uncharacteristically poor Premier League season continues, with this being their ninth league defeat, leaving their usual top-four finish in serious doubt. Despite six league titles in seven years, Pep Guardiola’s side finds itself in an unfamiliar battle to secure a Champions League spot.This was City’s first league defeat to Forest since 1997, putting them in a precarious position with just a one-point lead over Chelsea, who could leapfrog them with a win against Leicester on Sunday. A fifth-place finish might still be enough for Champions League qualification , but that depends on English clubs' performances in European competitions this season.Meanwhile, Forest’s remarkable transformation from last season’s relegation fight continued, as they climbed to third place, maintaining a four-point cushion over City. The two-time European champions are now edging closer to their first Champions League qualification since 1980-81.The match began with an emotional tribute to Stuart Pearce, who was hospitalised after falling ill on a flight. Forest honoured their former defender with a ""Get Well Soon Stuart"" message displayed on the big screen after three minutes.A cagey first half saw few clear-cut chances, with Nico Gonzalez narrowly missing from distance, and Josko Gvardiol setting up Phil Foden, only for Nicolas Dominguez to block his shot. Bernardo Silva then wasted an opportunity, failing to spot an unmarked Erling Haaland.Jeremy Doku forced Matz Sels into his first real save, while Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White failed to hit the target with a speculative effort. After the break, Anthony Elanga’s cross found Dominguez, whose volley forced Ederson into action.Guardiola responded by introducing Omar Marmoush, Kevin De Bruyne, Rico Lewis, and Mateo Kovacic in an attempt to break the deadlock, but the changes had little impact as Forest grew in confidence.City had a scare when Hudson-Odoi’s curling effort was brilliantly tipped onto the post by Ederson. De Bruyne’s free-kick was then comfortably saved by Sels before Hudson-Odoi finally broke through in the 83rd minute.Gibbs-White delivered a perfectly weighted pass, allowing Hudson-Odoi to cut inside and smash a powerful strike past Ederson’s weak near-post save, sparking wild celebrations at the City Ground.",Nottingham Forest beat Manchester City 1-0 at the City Ground. Callum Hudson- Odoi scored the only goal of the game in the 83rd minute. City's Champions League hopes are now in serious doubt. The defeat was City's first in the Premier League since 1997.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118806843,imgsize-52562,width-400,resizemode-4/118806843.jpg"

PANAJI: India’s India’s record goal scorer Sunil Chhetri has been coaxed to come out of retirement and join the national team for the crucial final round of the AFC Asian Cup 2027 qualifiers.The 40-year-old Chhetri was included among the 26 probables for the international friendly against Maldives on March 19 and the Group C opener of the Asian Cup qualifiers against Bangladesh on March 25 in Shillong. India, without a win in the whole of 2024, have been clubbed with Bangladesh, Hong Kong and Singapore with only the top team making it to the continental showpiece in Saudi Arabia.“The qualification for the Asian Cup is very crucial for us. Given the importance of the tournament and the matches ahead, I discussed with Sunil Chhetri about making a comeback to strengthen the national team. He agreed, and so we have included him in the squad,” India coach Manolo Marquez said on Thursday.The striker had not made any official statement on this development till late Thursday.BFC however put out a cryptic “Maybe all goodbyes are just an ‘I’ll see you soon’ in disguise,” on their official X handle.“Sunil’s leadership qualities are unmatched. He has played international football for close to two decades and a player of his stature can motivate the entire team. His form too has been impeccable in the ISL, scoring 12 goals. India can greatly benefit with a striker like him in the team,” said All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Kalyan Chaubey.Chhetri is India’s highest-ever goalscorer and was third among the world’s active players, behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, when he called time on his international career in May last year.Since then, he has continued to star for Bengaluru FC and has scored goals in the Indian Super League (ISL). This season he has scored 12 goals in the ISL, second only to the Moroccan Alaaeddine Ajaraie who tops the list with a record 21 for NorthEast United.Other Indian strikers have not really delivered, prompting Marquez to fall back on the services of the veteran striker. Marquez, who also coaches FC Goa, took over the national team after Chhetri’s international retirement and will have him in the dressing room for the first time. In his first assignment — the Inter -Continental Cup — Marquez tried young Kiyan Nassiri, Edmund Lalrindika, Manvir Singh and Liston Colaco upfront without much success.India drew goalless against Mauritius and lost 0-3 to Syria. India did score in the next two friendlies against Vietnam and Malaysia, both ending 1-1, through Farukh Chaudhary and Rahul Bheke. The only bright spark for Marquez and Indian football this season has been the rise of Brison Fernandes, with the Goa winger’s seven goals bracketing him among the top-10 strikers in the ISL.He could provide the surprise element on the wings for the national team, if declared fit. The other big call in the national team probable list is the exclusion of goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu. The first name on the starting list for several years, Gurpreet’s form for BFC this season has been inconsistent and marked by errors.He lost his place in the team for two games to Lalthuammawia Ralte but has since made a comeback. ISL Golden Glove contender Vishal Kaith (Mohun Bagan), Amrinder Singh (Odisha) and Gurmeet Singh (NorthEast) are the three goalkeepers in Marquez’s list.","India's record goal scorer Sunil Chhetri has been coaxed to come out of retirement and join the national team.

However, with his current struggles on the court, that ambition is quickly fading.""Now it's less, because I'm just playing terrible,"" said Zverev, who made early exits at Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and Acapulco before his disastrous Indian Wells showing.He became the first men's top seed at Indian Wells to crash out in the opening round since Andy Murray in 2017.""I have to find my game before thinking about that, because to become world number one you have to win tournaments,"" Zverev said.""I'm not past getting first, second round at the moment. So I need to figure that out first.""Zverev admitted he had no clear explanation for his dip in form since the Australian Open.Before the tournament, he had cited illness during two of the three weeks of his ""rough South American swing"" as a possible factor.However, after his 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/4) loss to 43rd-ranked Griekspoor—who had been defeated in six of their previous seven meetings—Zverev conceded that he was simply not playing well enough.""I'm not playing a level that I want to play, definitely not playing anywhere near what I played in Australia,"" he said.After taking the first set against Griekspoor, Zverev staged a comeback from 2-5 down in the second to lead 6-5, only to be broken while serving for the match.In the third set, he saved five match points in the 12th game and converted his fifth break point to push the contest into a decisive tiebreak. However, he could not hold off Griekspoor any longer, ultimately falling short.""He played a good match,"" Zverev said. ""There's no question about that. But I have to look at myself a little bit.""""It's everything,"" he said. ""I keep working, but right now it's not clicking.""",World No. 2 Alexander Zverev loses to Tallon Griekspoor in the first round of the Indian Wells Masters. He is the first men's top seed to lose in the opening round since Andy Murray in 2017. The German admits he is not playing at a level he wants to play.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118797150,imgsize-26982,width-400,resizemode-4/118797150.jpg"

Brazilian rising star Joao Fonseca demonstrated resilience by overcoming a third-set deficit to defeat British player Jacob Fearnley 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 on Thursday at Indian Wells .The teenager, who earned his place in history as the 10th-youngest ATP Tour winner with his victory at the Argentina Open in February, said: ""Today was petty difficult, a lot of windy, but I got through. Beginning of the match I played really well and he was making some mistakes. But the second set he played more aggressive and I was a bit more tight, maybe a bit more nervous.""Fearnley seemed to gain the upper hand after breaking Fonseca's serve in the third set's third game, and subsequently held his serve for a 3-1 lead in a lengthy game that reached deuce on five occasions.However, Fonseca responded by claiming the following five games in succession, securing two service breaks and finishing the competitive match between the world's 80th and 81st-ranked competitors with a decisive backhand volley winner.In the women's opening round, Olympic champion Belinda Bencic from Switzerland secured a straightforward victory against Germany's Tatjana Maria, winning 6-1, 6-1 in a swift 65-minute match.The Abu Dhabi champion from February 2024, Bencic, who welcomed her daughter Bella in April 2023, has made an impressive return to competitive tennis following her maternity break.The 27-year-old Swiss player, who has exceeded expectations in her return to the sport, acknowledged that managing the playing conditions was crucial to her success in the match.""Obviously today the main topic was the wind, trying to accept it and not trying to make it pretty -- just staying in the rallies, trying to be more smart rather than playing amazing shots.""Japanese tennis player and Indian Wells debutant Moyuka Uchijima delivered a commanding performance to defeat former US Open champion Emma Raducanu with a score of 6-3, 6-2.The victory earned Uchijima a second-round clash against world number three Coco Gauff.","Joao Fonseca defeats British player Jacob Fearnley 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 at Indian Wells.

'The next big thing' in Indian tennis blooming under Rafael Nadal's watchful eyes: Maaya Rajeshwaran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/exclusive-the-next-big-thing-in-indian-tennis-blooming-under-rafael-nadals-watchful-eyes-maaya-rajeshwaran/articleshow/118757183.cms,"(Instagram Photo)

NEW DELHI: ""Learning, enjoying, and sharing time and experiences with these young and talented players,"" Rafael Nadal penned a post on X (formerly Twitter) not even a fortnight ago. The post featured an image of the tennis great at the center. To his left stood three teenage girls, and to his right, four more. On his far right, one could spot 15-year-old Maaya in her training attire, looking somewhat nervous, her right index finger tucked into her left fist.Nervousness was quite palpable - after all, the 22-time Grand Slam champion was right there in person at his Rafa Nadal Academy on the island of Mallorca, his watchful, forever-fiery eyes evaluating the teens.As for Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi , this was her first meetup with the ""King of Clay"" after taking the tennis scene by storm with her exceptional performance at the Mumbai Open earlier this year.But here's a fun fact: Mumbai wasn't even on her calendar at the start of the year.""First of all, playing the Mumbai Open wasn't even part of the plan. My wildcard was confirmed just 2 days before the tournament,"" Maaya, born to father Rajeshwaran and mother Revathi in a Tamil family, told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive chat. ""I was very confident that I'd compete well. Honestly, I didn't expect that I'd make it that far, but I just played match by match and gave my best.""Romping past opponents far more experienced than her, the rising star made waves across the tennis fraternity.As she reached the semi-finals at the Cricket Club of India and became the first 2009-born player to make semi-final of a WTA 125 event, some even clasped their hands in prayer, hoping for an outlandish title win. But a defeat to 27-year-old Jil Teichmann in the semis brought Maaya's dream run to an end.""After losing in the semi-finals, I was a bit upset because I didn't play as well as I hoped I would. But I had a lot of positives to take away from the Mumbai Open,"" added the rising star following the best series of results in her professional circuit so far.Even tennis was not part of Maaya's plan until she turned eight. For her, it was initially just a ""recreational sport"" after school.She decided to go pro when she was 10. At the heart of her journey are her parents, who, in Maaya's words, have been incredibly supportive.""I'm so blessed that my mom can travel with me. My home has always been my family, and also, I have a very good support system back home. Sometimes, I do miss them a lot,"" she told TimesofIndia.com. ""But specifically, I miss my dad so much. I'm very close to both my parents. I think if my dad would also be with me, I would feel very much like home.""At such a young age, staying abroad can make anyone homesick. Yet, this is exactly what Maaya had always wanted. She recalled, ""We were looking for a base in Europe last year, and the invitation from the Rafa Nadal Academy was quite surprising. But we were very happy that they took me in.""An avid reader and movie buff, Maaya also loves baking - baking, as she bakes, those chants already labelling her as the ""next big thing"" in Indian tennis. ""I'm definitely not worried about that. In fact, it's very supportive and encouraging to see people believe in me,"" she added.Currently, she is more into wading through the pages of the novel ""The Palace of Illusions"" by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni as Maya reflected, ""If I could tell something to my younger self now, it would be to trust myself and the good people around me, no matter what happened, no matter if I didn't win, I just had to do what I love to do with all my heart.""You've probably heard these sayings: A life without a goal is like a ship without a rudder, a car without a steering wheel... or, for tennis fans, Rafael Nadal without a Grand Slam (not quite a famous one yet), but you get the idea.What is it that always drives Maaya?""The ultimate goal for me is to become the world no. 1 and win slams,"" sighed the current world no. 1 Aryna Sabalenka's aficionado.","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi, 15, is the first 2009-born player to make semi-final of a WTA 125 event.

Naomi Osaka was bundled out of the first round at Indian Wells on Wednesday, falling 6-4, 6-4 to Camila Osorio in the Japanese star's first tournament since injury forced her out of the Australian Open.Former world number one Osaka, now ranked 56th in the world, looked rusty against the 52nd-ranked Colombian, struggling to find the range on her powerful groundstrokes on a chilly night in the California desert.Osorio, who challenged Osaka with an array of drop shots and slices, gained the lone break of the opening set for a 5-4 lead and served it out without a hitch, then broke Osaka to open the second.The Japanese star immediately broke back, but Osorio gained the upper hand with a break in the seventh game. After Osaka fought off a match point against her own serve Osorio served it out, fighting off four break points to seal it with a stinging forehand winner.It was a winning return from injury for Osorio, who pulled out of last week's event in Merida, Mexico, with an abdominal injury.Osaka, who returned from a 15-month break last year after giving birth to daughter Shai in 2023, reached her first final since 2022 in Auckland, but retired from the title match with an abdominal injury.Back for the Australian Open, she was forced to retire from her third round match with an abdominal strain.Osorio, owner of two WTA titles, booked a second-round meeting with Denmark's Clara Tauson, the 22nd seed, who took the title in Auckland when Osaka retired.Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, on the comeback trail seven months after giving birth to her son Petr, also fell in the first round.France's 70th-ranked Varvara Gracheva beat the Czech 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, but the 24-year-old was full of admiration for her 34-year-old opponent, who lifted the trophy at Wimbledon in 2011 and 2014.""If you let me step back a little bit, I really want to congratulate her,"" Gracheva said. ""Because she had a child quite recently, and I'm so happy that she now has the role of a mother and a tennis player, which is very demanding. It's very inspiring for sports, athletes, women -- it's just amazing.""All 32 men's and women's seeds have first round byes in this combined ATP Masters and WTA 1000 tournament.Gracheva lined up a second-round meeting with ninth-seeded Mirra Andreeva, the 17-year-old Russian who became the youngest ever WTA 1000 champion in Dubai last month.In other matches, French veteran Caroline Garcia beat US wild card Bernarda Pera 6-3, 6-4 to line up a second-round meeting with second-seeded defending champion Iga Swiatek.- Nishikori battles through -In men's action, Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands beat Miomir Kecmanovic of Serbia 6-7 (5/7), 6-4, 6-3 to book a second-round meeting with top-seeded German Alexander Zverev, who heads a field missing world number one Jannik Sinner as he serves a three-months drugs ban.China's Bu Yunchaokete defeated American Nishesh Basavareddy 7-5, 6-4 to book a second-round match against Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev, runner-up the past two years to Carlos Alcaraz -- who is seeded second as he chases a rare three-peat.Japanese veteran Kei Nishikori, who revealed during the Australian Open that he almost quit tennis last year after lengthy battles with injury, defeated Spain's Jaume Munar 6-2, 5-7, 7-6 (7/3) to line up a second-round match against 18th-seeded Ugo Humbert of France.Nishikori was treated for a leg injury in the third set and then soldiered through cramp to close out the victory.""It was not easy,"" Nishikori said. ""In the third set I was cramping pretty badly, but somehow I came back and won, so a very good match.""bb/rcw",Camila Osorio beats Naomi Osaka in first round of Indian Wells.

Emma Raducanu revealed she experienced severe emotional distress, unable to see clearly or breathe properly when she noticed a man who was intensely focused on her during a match.The British tennis star, who won the 2021 US Open, became upset during her match at the Dubai Championships last month due to the presence of this individual in the stands.The spectator, who had previously approached Raducanu during the tournament, was removed from the venue after she alerted the chair umpire during her second-round match against Karolina Muchova .Dubai police subsequently detained the individual, who signed an agreement to maintain distance from Raducanu. The WTA confirmed the person displayed obsessive behaviour.Speaking to British journalists at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, her first competition since the event, Raducanu described her distress.""I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, I don't know how I'm going to finish'. I literally couldn't see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe. I was like, I need to just take a breather here'.""Despite continuing after the individual's removal, Raducanu lost 7-6 6-4.She explained that her post-match emotional response wasn't primarily due to the defeat.Speaking to the BBC, Raducanu acknowledged that while the situation could have been handled more effectively, security measures have been enhanced.""I'm always now very aware and not necessarily doing things on my own any more. I'm always with someone and always being watched,"" Raducanu told the BBC.Previously in 2022, authorities issued a restraining order against an obsessive supporter who visited her residence three times.Raducanu is scheduled to compete against Japan's Moyuka Uchijima, ranked 52nd globally, three positions above her, in Thursday's first round in California. The victor will face third-seeded Coco Gauff , as the top 32 players receive automatic advancement to round two.","Emma Raducanu reveals she experienced severe emotional distress when she noticed a man who was intensely focused on her during a match.

WTA Merida Open

Mérida:

World number four Jessica Pegula powered to her first WTA title of 2025 on Sunday, beating McCartney Kessler 7-5, 6-2 in an all-American final in Austin, Texas.Pegula, the top seed, claimed a seventh WTA title and her first since she won the 1000 event in Toronto last year.That was one of Pegula's two titles in a 2024 campaign in which she also reached the US Open final.In Kessler she stopped a fast-rising talent, whose first two WTA finals had yielded a pair of titles -- in Cleveland last August and at Hobart in January.The 25-year-old arrived in Austin riding high after claiming her first career top-10 player with an upset of Coco Gauff in the second round at Dubai.But she couldn't find a way past Pegula, who snapped a three-match losing streak in finals for a confidence-building crown heading into the prestigious hard court tournaments at Indian Wells and Miami.Pegula, the only top-10 player in the draw, dropped just one set all week.Kessler looked set to change that when she rallied from 0-2 down to take a 4-2 lead in the first set.But too many unforced errors from Kessler allowed Pegula to get back in front and after Kessler missed a chance to break in the 11th game she was broken in the next as Pegula pocketed the first set.Kessler broke Pegula to open the second, but Pegula won the next four games to seize control.Top-seeded American Emma Navarro capped a dominant week with a 6-0, 6-0 thrashing of qualifier Emiliana Arango in the final of the WTA Merida Open on Sunday.Navarro, seeded No. 1 for the first time, marched to her second WTA title without dropping a set, adding the 500-level crown to the title she won in Hobart last year.Navarro hadn't reached a final since, although she made it to the quarter-finals or better at the last three Grand Slams and came into the week ranked 10th in the world.She needed just 55 minutes to subdue Arango, becoming the first player to win a WTA final 6-0, 6-0 since Iga Swiatek blanked Karolina Pliskova in the 2021 Rome title match.Arango, a 24-year-old Colombian who made it past the quarter-finals of a WTA tournament for the first time this week, came into the tournament ranked 133rd in the world and will crack the top 100 when the new rankings are announced on Monday.","Jessica Pegula wins WTA title in Austin, Texas.

Exclusive | Arjuna Awardee Vantika Agrawal: 'People still ask, 'Chess is fine, but what do you really do?''

NEW DELHI: Former Asian Games bronze-winner in volleyball and the father of badminton superstar PV Sindhu, PV Ramana, offers a balanced perspective on the debate surrounding the challenges of pursuing sports in India, particularly for middle-class families.Ramana's own journey, from a lower-middle-class background to becoming the parent of a two-time Olympic medalist Sindhu, serves as an instance of opportunities that sports can provide.""My father died when I was 3, I was the youngest of 10 siblings. But my elder brothers and sisters, they were so happy to support me and see me play national-level volleyball, why? Because I got a Railways job because of that sport,"" he told PTI. ""So, if you are lower middle-class or middle-class, being good in any sport actually opens up opportunities for you. Not to forget, sport is great for a child's overall development.""While acknowledging the challenges, Ramana emphasises the importance of finding a balance between sports and academics.""Talent always reveals itself and is never a prisoner of wealth. As a parent, you have to find the balance. When I realised my elder daughter was academically inclined, I encouraged her to pursue that,"" he said. ""With Sindhu, she was way ahead of everyone on the badminton court by the time she entered 10th standard in school. She had found sponsors because everyone could see she was destined for big things. We should trust the children too. They also have instincts. I don't think as a sportsperson, one should discourage others from sports.""Ramana believes that talent is not confined to wealth and that parents should trust their children's instincts and abilities and should not discourage them from taking up sports.""Getting a job through sport is one of the major considerations for middle-class parents and from what I know, there are plenty of opportunities. Railways itself is hiring thousands of athletes,"" he added. ""Also, being good in sports gets you admission in premier educational institutions through sports quota. It is the responsibility of the coaches to guide young players through proper notification of job openings and other opportunities. All academies should be doing this.""Furthermore, Ramana stresses the role of coaches in guiding young players through proper notification of job openings and other opportunities.""We should never forget that minimum graduation is required for an athlete too (to find a decent job). These days, there is quota in jobs for retired athletes as well,"" he added. ""So, don't discourage, let the child flow. In my view, they should be encouraged to find balance and pay attention to academics also because you are not training the entire day. There is time for other things.""""During Sindhu's formative years, there were days she would ask me how was it that some kids in her training travel by air while we always took the train. But look at her now,"" Ramana said.""Struggle will be there but you have to be prepared.""",PV Ramana is the father of two-time Olympic medalist PV Sindhu.

Former Commonwealth Games badminton champion Parupalli Kashyap backed Pullela Gopichand's statement to TOI about the challenges middle-class families face in sports. He emphasised that his coach's observations accurately portray the realities of India's sporting environment.Kashyap specifically addressed the absence of support systems for athletes who don't achieve top-level success. He characterised Gopichand 's advisory as ""pragmatic, not pessimistic.""""Gopi sir's recent remarks about the challenges middle-class families face in pursuing sports as a career resonate deeply with the realities of India's sporting ecosystem,"" the 2014 CWG champion posted in 'X'.""He's absolutely right to highlight the lack of a safety net for athletes who don't reach the top. In a country where success in sports - outside of cricket - rarely guarantees financial security or societal respect, his call for caution is pragmatic, not pessimistic.""The middle class, often tethered to the promise of stable jobs and education, risks everything by banking on athletic glory when the odds are stacked against them - less than 1% make it big, and even fewer sustain a livelihood post-career.""Kashyap, who achieved career-high ranking of World No. 6 during his playing days, interpreted Gopichand's comments as a necessary call to address fundamental issues in Indian sports.""Look at the examples he cited: national champions relegated to junior clerk roles or Olympic medallists struggling in dead-end sports quota jobs, facing humiliation rather than honour.""""India's infrastructure may be improving, but without robust systems to skill up athletes for alternative careers or ensure dignity in retirement, the dream of sporting success remains a gamble most can't afford.""""Gopi sir's not discouraging passion - he's urging a hard look at the structural gaps that leave most athletes high and dry. It's a wake-up call we need to heed.""Former shuttler Guru Sai Dutt also voiced his support for Gopichand through social media.""When the fear of security and stability overshadows the passion to pursue sports, we, as a nation, fail to cultivate the right environment for the values we cherish.""""What Gopi sir is advocating for is the establishment of systems that provide support and reassurance to those fully committed to the sport, through initiatives that nurture and encourage their growth.""""His statement is not meant to discourage children from taking up the sport, but rather to call on everyone to create long-term growth opportunities. It's crucial that we all understand and make this distinction clear.""Gopichand had recently sparked debate by suggesting that middle-class families should reconsider professional sports careers due to insufficient support systems for athletes who don't reach elite levels.",Parupalli Kashyap backs Pullela Gopichand's comments about middle-class families in sports. Former CWG badminton champion says his coach's observations accurately portray the realities of India's sporting environment.

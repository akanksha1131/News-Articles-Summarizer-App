NEW DELHI: As Indian cricket holds its breath over Jasprit Bumrah ’s fitness, it has emerged his back injury is due to be assessed by orthopedic surgeon Dr Rowan Schouten in New Zealand, with a consultation visit also planned depending on his report and feedback.TOI understands that the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) is already planning a backup since Bumrah could be cutting it very fine to get fit in time for ICC Champions Trophy next month.The ace bowler has been picked for CT and also named in the team for the third ODI against England in Ahmedabad on Feb 12, but there are no high hopes around him.The changes to the CT team can be made till Feb 11. The selectors have already named Harshit Rana for the first two ODIs against England. It will be interesting to see if they continue with Rana should Bumrah fail to get fit for CT.Sources said given the experience he has, Mohammed Siraj could be back in contention in such a scenario.“The BCCI medical team is in touch with Schouten in New Zealand. The board had also planned a visit for Bumrah to New Zealand. But that hasn’t happened yet. The selectors know it will be a miracle if Bumrah turns up 100% fit in the given timeline,” a BCCI source told TOI.Schouten had operated on Bumrah after he missed the T20 World Cup in 2022. He didn’t take the field in the second innings of the Sydney Test in the first week of this month when he complained of discomfort in his back.Bumrah and the rest of the fast bowlers who played most Test matches during the Test season were advised to take a three week offloading process. The offloading process dictates a player to not undertake any strenuous physical activity which includes basic fitness training as well. BCCI’s medical team was due to evaluate Bumrah’s condition after the offloading process which was due to end last week.“The reports will be shared with his doctor in New Zealand. Sending Bumrah to New Zealand will depend on the feedback. The board and Bumrah himself are not willing to push hard given his significance over a long period of time,” the source said.“The selectors will only be informed if he is ready to take the field after the entire process is complete. The selectors will need to keep a backup plan ready for him. It will be a miracle if Bumrah makes it,” the source added.It may be recalled that the Indian team tried to rush Bumrah back in action in a home series against Australia in 2022 which resulted in him breaking down again and he subsequently missed the T20 World Cup. Mohammed Shami’s comeback in international cricket is held back as the team management has not opted to play him in the first two T20Is against England.However, TOI understands that the team management is saving him for the ODI season, and is happy with how Shami is shaping up after a long injury layoff.“Shami has shed two kgs from what he weighed before his injury. He is bowling at full tilt. He is not needed as much in the T20 matches. But he should be good to go once the ODIs come around,” the source added.",Jasprit Bumrah's back injury is due to be assessed by orthopedic surgeon Dr Rowan Schouten in New Zealand. A consultation visit is also planned depending on his report and feedback.

CHENNAI: Tilak Varma may only be at the nascent stage of his T20I career, but the versatile India batter is moulding into a bankable resource.In the tour to South Africa late last year, the left-hander, who was promoted to No. 3, activated his destructive mode, especially during his twin unbeaten centuries. While Tilak has carved a niche for himself with positive intent-filled knocks, the fast-rising 22-year-old on Saturday displayed another key facet of his game.Up against a pace-heavy England attack on a tricky Chepauk track in the second T20I, Tilak showed excellent awareness in the successful 166-run chase and did just what the doctor ordered when the match seemed to be drifting away from the hosts. The southpaw expertly blended caution and aggression besides taking up the lead role in tough circumstances.“The pitch was double-paced and it was quite challenging to bat on. Wickets were falling continuously, and I was thinking that I should bat till the end. I wanted to show intent and I was looking for the gaps as well. I did that,” said Tilak after delivering a spectacular unbeaten 72, for which the ‘Man of the Match’ deservedly received a standing ovation.“I know that I can play both types, hitting at a good strike-rate and scoring at six or seven runs per over. During the drinks break, Gautam Gambhir (head coach) told me that I can show everyone that I can play over 10 and under 10 (run-rate). He asked me to be flexible. I got a chance to prove myself in this game,” added Tilak.The youngster operated with a simple yet effective mantra. He met fire with fire, targeting pacer Jofra Archer , whom he smacked for 30 runs off just nine deliveries.“I wanted to take on their (England’s) best bowlers. If I take on the best bowlers, it will put pressure on the others. When wickets were falling, I wanted to take on their best bowler. I felt that it would make the job easier for the batters at the other end. I backed myself and took chances. I was mentally prepared for it, having played those shots at the nets,” he said.Brimming with confidence after producing yet another effective knock, Tilak is prepared to perform a different role if required. “Before the South Africa series, I had not batted much at No. 3, maybe two or three times. I am ready to bat anywhere, and I am flexible. I know how to manage while batting at Nos 4, 5 or 6, but I like batting at No. 3. What the team needs, I am ready for that,” Tilak went on to add.",Tilak Varma named Man of the Match in India's second T20I win over England. The 22-year-old scored 72 not out in Chepauk. He was promoted to No. 3 from No. 4 on the tour of South Africa last year.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117589058,imgsize-39890,width-400,resizemode-4/117589058.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Round 8 matchup of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 between Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu and Gukesh Dommaraju on Sunday drew significant attention in Wijk aan Zee , with a large crowd gathering at the Dutch venue to witness the youngest-ever World Chess Champion face his compatriot.Defending the black pieces, Gukesh went for the Berlin Defense in a Ruy López opening. Following Praggnanandhaa’s castling on his 6th move, Gukesh chose to move his queen. However, neither player seemed eager to push forward, instead playing a balanced game on the board.Gukesh, who had the advantage, played a careless move (a3), giving Praggnanandhaa some industry. As the queens were exchanged, the game seemed to drift towards a deadlock. Both players made attempts to break the stalemate but were unable to find a way forward, ultimately agreeing to a draw after 33 moves.The result did little to alter the standings at the top of the Masters leaderboard. Co-leader Nodirbek Abdusattorov also drew his game against the fiercely competitive Vladimir Fedoseev of Russia, meaning that Nodirbek, Gukesh, and Praggnanandhaa all continue to share the top spot, each with 5.5 points.Arjun Erigaisi , still winless in the tournament, drew his game against Serbia’s Alexey Sarana. Ranked World No. 4 and India’s No. 1 entering the tournament, Arjun has seen his form's noticeable decline, losing around 30 ELO points over the last week. He now sits in sixth place, behind Nodirbek Abdusattorov in the live world rankings.Sarana, playing with the black pieces, faced the Queen’s Knight variation of the Queen’s Gambit Declined. Arjun took a conservative approach while Sarana pressed for an advantage.However, Arjun held his position firm, and Sarana had no choice but to agree to a draw on the 23rd move. Given Arjun’s poor form, this draw can be considered a welcome respite, especially with a rest day on Monday allowing him the chance to reset.Dutch No. 1 Anish Giri registered his seventh consecutive draw of the tournament, this time against India’s Pentala Harikrishna. In another 30-move game, Leon Luke Mendonca of India also drew against the Netherlands’ Jorden van Foreest.Top seed Fabiano Caruana defeated Germany’s Vincent Keymer, claiming his second win in the 87th edition of the “Wimbledon of Chess”. Defending champion Wei Yi beat Dutchman Max Warmerdam in one of the longest games of the day (63 moves).In the Challengers section, Vaishali Rameshbabu fought valiantly against Arthur Pijpers, with the game ending in a draw. India’s 19-year-old Divya Deshmukh, playing with the white pieces, lost to Kazakhstan’s Kazybek Nogerbek.The 11-year-old Argentinian sensation Faustino Oro resigned against Aydin Suleymanli, while Chinese wonder Lu Miaoyi was also defeated by the sole Challengers leader, Thai Dai Van Nguyen.","Gukesh Dommaraju and Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu draw in Round 8 of Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025.

Jannik Sinner retains Australian Open title with straight sets victory over Alexander Zverev,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/australian-open/jannik-sinner-retains-australian-open-title-with-straight-sets-victory-over-alexander-zverev/articleshow/117578014.cms,"(Photo by Darrian Traynor/Getty Images)

Jannik Sinner threw in a daring drop shot at match point, it came off his forehand side and was shaped with underspin. Alexander Zverev picked it up and didn't place it too poorly, but Sinner stepped in and swung through the court to close out the Australian Open final.After two-hours and 42-minutes of action in which time he strung together the 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 win, Sinner, the world No.1, pushed his head back and threw up his arms in celebration. After the few seconds he had to himself, Rod Laver Arena on its feet, cheering him, Sinner looked at his team – coaches Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi, trainer and physio Marco Panichi and Ulises Badio – before going over to embrace them.Not far from where Sinner celebrated his second successive win at Australian Open, Zverev, the world No.2, sat in his courtside seat, head bowed. The German has played three Slam finals and is looking for his first major title.Sinner and Zverev shared a warm embrace at the net and the 23-year-old began his speech with encouraging words for Zverev.""You are an amazing player,"" Sinner said. ""Keep believing in yourself, because all players and coaches know how strong you are, not only as a player, but also as a person. We all believe that you can lift one of these very, very soon.""Sinner, now a two-time Australian Open champion, and a three-time major winner, placed the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup beside him as he spoke, said, ""Talking about my team, what can I say? We worked a lot to be again in this position. It’s an amazing feeling to share this moment with all of you. It is amazing to achieve these things, but mostly to share this with you guys.""""And I know Darren, it's probably your - maybe, I try to convince you to stay - your last Australian Open as a coach, and I'm very, very happy to share this trophy with you,"" Sinner told Cahill, who was tearing up. ""Everything started a little bit when I made my whole change to Simone (Vagnozzi), and I think you are an amazing combination of coaches.""Earlier, when the German stepped forward to make his speech, there was a shout from the crowd, ""Australia Believes Olya and Brenda! Australia Believes Olya and Brenda!""Zverev battled a domestic violence case in Germany last year, accused by his ex-girlfriend Brenda Patea, the mother of his child, of physically abusing her. All of which he denies and wasn't formally charged.When asked about it in the press conference, Zverev said, ""I believe there are no more accusations. There haven't been for nine months now. Good for her. I think she was the only one in the stadium who believed anything in that moment. I think I've done everything I can, and I'm not about to open that subject again.""Zverev applauded the winner in his speech. ""You are the best player in the world by far. I was hoping that I could be more of a competitor today, but you were just too good. Congratulations to you. You really deserve it.""Sinner, who hasn't lost a set against top-ten opponents since losing to Carlos Alcaraz in Beijing in September, may not have played his best match in the final, but did enough to get through without facing a breakpoint.Sinner was kitted in colour blocks of the palest yellow and white, his attire cutting an anaemic look, while across the net Zverev was all colour, red on maroon with red shoes.In the first set, the 27-year-old, coming into the net, trying to unsettle the Italian, gave Sinner some target practice. The German trailed 15-40 in the fourth and eighth games, if the defending champion was sharpening his knife in the fourth game, he struck in the eighth and then went on to serve out the set at love in the ninth, closing with a 194 kmph ace.The roof over Rod Laver Arena was open and like the evening sky, that had lost some of its sparkle, Zverev, who looked to be in striking form as he advanced to the final at Melbourne Park , seemed to have lost some of the edge. The German did well to push the set to tie-break, where Sinner came through with a slice of luck on the ninth point, the net cord working for him, and the world No.1 broke away to seal a two-sets-to-love lead.In the third set, Sinner broke in the sixth game, as a dejected Zverev appeared to throw in the towel. The Italian was out in the front and didn't look back.","World No.1 Jannik Sinner beats Alexander Zverev in Australian Open final. Sinner wins 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6- 3 in two-hours and 42-minutes in Melbourne. German Sinner is a two-time Australian Open champion and three-time major winner.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117578658,imgsize-55946,width-400,resizemode-4/117578658.jpg"

Joburg Super Kings pacers Lutho Sipamla and Hardus Viljoen dominated the Sunrisers Eastern Cape at the Wanderers on Sunday, leading their side's decisive nine-wicket bonus-point win on Sunday at the Wanderers.After the Super Kings opted to bowl first, Sipamla delivered an impressive opening spell, claiming 3 for 13, which was followed by Viljoen's devastating burst of 4 for 24 towards the backend. It restricted the Sunrisers to a mere 118 runs.The chase was then led by New Zalander Devon Conway, who remained unbeaten on 76.Sipamla broke the back of Sunrisers' top order. He first had England batter Zak Crawley (0) caught at slip and then dismissed Tom Abell for a duck as well, leaving the visitors struggling at 0 for 2 at the conclusion of the first over.The situation deteriorated further for the Sunrisers as Jordan Hermann and Aiden Markram departed shortly afterwards without scoring, reducing the defending champions to 17 for 4.

THE COSTLY DROP

ENGLAND 'SPUN OUT' AGAIN

Tilak Varma produced an exceptional innings in a tough situation while wickets kept falling around him and managed to hold his nerve in India's famous two-wicket win against England in the second T20I at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Saturday.The last-over win gave India a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.Varma's (72 not out of 55 balls) skilfully exploited the pace battery of English bowlers and steered India to their target, with the home side concluding at 166 for 8 in 19.2 overs.The innings was particularly remarkable as the left-handed batter had minimal support from his partners, while the England bowlers maintained their momentum after securing breakthroughs at regular intervals.Jofra Archer proved particularly costly, with Varma targeting him specifically, striking four sixes against the Sussex bowler, the fourth bringing up his fifty, as Archer conceded 60 runs in four overs besides claiming Sanju Samson's (5) wicket.The southpaw's remarkable shot, sending the ball over deep fine leg for six against Brydon Carse (3 for 29), demonstrated his exceptional batting skills.India faced tense moments at the start of their run-chase before Varma's steadfast batting guided them to victory.Opener Abhishek Sharma (12) began India's innings brilliantly, striking three boundaries against Archer in the opening over. However, Mark Wood's pace caught him on the back foot and the review of the LBW decision by the batter stayed in favour of Wood.The situation shortly deteriorated to 19 for 2 with Samson's departure.A swift 39-run partnership between captain Suryakumar Yadav and Varma alleviated some pressure, taking the score to 58, but Carse dismissed Suryakumar (12), who played onto his stumps.The English pace attack capitalised on the opportunity, as India lost Dhruv Jurel (4) and Hardik Pandya's (7) wickets and were left struggling at 78 for 5.Washington Sundar capitalised on his early fortune when Adil Rashid dropped him at mid-on off Wood's bowling. He went on to strike Wood for a six and two fours in quick succession, helping in bringing the required run-rate in manageable space.However, Sundar's innings (26 off 19) came to an end when he attempted to guide Carse towards third-man, only to have his stumps disturbed.At that stage, India were struggling at 116 for 6, but found resilience through Varma.After India won the toss and opted to bowl, England captain Jos Buttler showed resistance, but his fellow English batters faltered against the Indian spinners.Buttler (45 off 30 balls) displayed his class with some brilliant shots, including a sequence of 4, 6, 4 against Arshdeep Singh, who had already dismissed Phil Salt in his opening over.Salt's attempt to pull the left-arm pacer fell short as Sundar, who came in for the injured Nitish Reddy, took the catch near the square leg boundary.Sundar found success when Ben Duckett's reverse sweep was caught by Jurel, who replaced the injured Rinku Singh.The pull shot proved to be problematic for England batters throughout the evening, with both Buttler and Liam Livingstone falling while attempting it.India's vice-captain Axar Patel (2 for 32) capitalised on England batters' aggressive approach.The left-arm spinner's strategy of bowling into the pitch, combined with the surface grip, made it difficult for batters to control their shots.Buttler, whose aggressive batting had helped England reach 58 for 2 in the Powerplay overs, was caught by Varma, while Livingstone was dismissed when he was caught by substitute fielder Harshit Rana.Carse, who replaced Atkinson in the line-up, displayed aggression with a quickfire 31 from 17 deliveries, including three sixes. However, his promising innings ended in a run-out after a mix-up with Archer.Another notable moment of England's batting show came in the form of Brook's dismissal. Despite starting well with a six against Varun Chakravarthy (2 for 38), Brook's innings was cut short.Chakravarthy's clever variation with a back-of-the-hand delivery proved too good for Brook, who failed to read the ball as it crashed into his off-stump.",Varma's (72 not out of 55 balls) skilfully exploited the pace battery of English bowlers and steered India to their target. The home side concluded at 166 for 8 in 19.2 overs. The last-over win gave India a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117560558,imgsize-47654,width-400,resizemode-4/117560558.jpg"

Henry Bernet accomplished what Roger Federer never did by clinching the Australian Open boys' championship on Saturday, with the young Swiss drawing inspiration from comparisons to his renowned countryman.The Swiss talent defeated American Benjamin Willwerth 6-3, 6-4 on his 18th birthday, joining distinguished players like Alexander Zverev, Nick Kyrgios and Gael Monfils as winners of the Melbourne junior title.Despite Federer's impressive collection of six Australian Opens within his 20 Grand Slam victories, the junior title remained notably absent from his achievements.Both tennis players hail from Basel and developed their skills at TC Old Boys Basel tennis club.Additionally, Bernet utilises the same single-handed backhand technique that characterised Federer's success, and now trains under Severin Luthi, who previously worked extensively with the Swiss champion.When questioned about managing inevitable parallels as he enters the main ATP Tour, Bernet stated: ""I'm just trying to develop myself, kind of make my own journey.""But obviously there's always going to be some comparisons. That's not a problem for me. It's a motivation.""His sole encounter with Federer occurred during last year's US Open.""I would love to talk to him again,"" he expressed when asked if he anticipated a call from the 43-year-old following his Australian achievement.","Henry Bernet won the Australian Open boys' championship on Saturday.

Intent might be everything on Sunday night when the Rod Laver Arena rocks to the beat of gunshot serves and muzzle energy off the ground.The common consensus in tennis circles is that Alexander Zverev , the world No. 2, is a ‘beast’ physically and should the Australian Open men’s singles final go the distance, it augurs well for the German whose 5-set record stands tall at 23-13.Jannik Sinner , the world No. 1, who hasn’t lost a match since Oct, but has struggled physically in Melbourne, will want to finish it quickly. The defending champion has lost five of his last six 5-set matches (from Jan 2023).Zverev, 27, playing his third major final, and looking for his first Grand Slam title, showed intent after coming up short against the genius of Carlos Alcaraz last June in Roland Garros, falling in five sets in the final. Not long after, Zverev signed up fitness guru Jez Green, who he had worked with early in his career (2015 to 2021).“I always knew that I could last with anyone for as long as I wanted when I was with Jez Green. When I was with him for seven years, I felt like I was one of the strongest players on tour, physically,” the world No. 2 said. “That was the reason why I hired him, to be physically at the same level again. I said it after the French Open final that I got tired against Carlos, I simply got tired in the fourth and fifth sets.”Sinner, who trails Zverev 2-4 in head-to-head clashes, will look to corner his opponent and make the contest a mental exchange. “It’s going to be mental, no?” the 23-year-old defending champion said of the final. “It’s going to be a tough match for both of us. It’ll be physical, for sure.”Sinner who rallied from 0-2 sets down to beat Daniil Medvedev in last year’s final isn’t new to the long story. He has learnt well from the six losses in nine 5-set affairs.“I try to put a lot of work in the days off, trying to understand my body,” said Sinner, who overcame physical discomfort in the fourth round against Holger Rune and in the semifinals against Ben Shelton. “There’s a lot of things going on, on and off the court. I try to isolate myself a little bit, trying to be myself on the court. There are days where it’s easier, days where I struggle a bit more.”Sinner’s coach Darren Cahill, who applauded the work Zverev has put in over the years, extolled the German’s physical prowess. “Jannik is improving, he’s getting better physically. He’s somewhat of a late developer with the body. He is about 6-ft-4-in now,” he said. “He’s going to get better as time goes along.”Zverev, who has saved 27 of 35 (77%) of breakpoints in this year’s championships, is only a tad behind the Italian who has saved 18 of 23 (78%). “Playing at night maybe will favour Jannik a bit more,” Zverev said.","Alexander Zverev faces Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open men's singles final.

Axar Patel hints at flexible middle-order ahead of England T20I series

CHENNAI: Tilak Varma is slowly but steadily turning into a T20 beast. Everything the southpaw is touching in the shortest format is turning into gold.Batting at No. 3 in recent times after skipper Suryakumar Yadav made a sacrifice by dropping to the next slot, Tilak (72 not out off 55 balls; 4x4, 5x6) on Saturday extended his dream run with a stunning display of his match-winning credentials. The 22-year-old singlehandedly guided India to a thrilling two wicket victory over England in a nervewracking second T20I at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, staying unbeaten for the fourth match in succession.India found themselves in a precarious position in the chase and were staring at an unlikely defeat after the hosts’ spinners pounced on the visitors’ weakness to restrict them to a below-par 165-9. Despite frequently losing partners at the other end, Tilak provided India hope with his assured knock that had an assortment of shots.The left-handed batter adopted a calculative approach, which was the need of the hour. When he smashed express pacer Jofra Archer for back-to-back sixes in the 16th over, it seemed that he was destined to pull off a tough chase. He batted remarkably well with the tail and after hitting Jamie Overton for the game-winning boundary, he pumped his fists in the air in sheer delight.Towards the deep end, he found an able ally in No. 10 batter Ravi Bishnoi as the duo guided India in choppy waters to the target.Before Tilak took over, the India tweakers combined for 14 overs and six of the nine wickets that fell as the tourists could only record 165-9 after being invited to bat first on what appeared a decent batting deck. Skipper Jos Buttler threatened with a 30-ball 45 (2x4, 3x6), while Brydon Carse (31 off 17 balls; 1x4, 3x6) and debutant Jamie Smith (22) were the other top contributors in an innings where England could never kick on.The India spinners struck at regular intervals after left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh set the tone early by removing Phil Salt in the first over. Left-arm orthodox bowler Axar Patel (2-32) was one of the chief architects of England’s downfall, removing Buttler and Liam Livingstone in similar fashion.Both batters tried to line Axar up and clear the fence on their leg-side, only to be sent back to the hut with catches on the boundary.Varun Chakravarthy (2-38) and Washington Sundar (1-9), playing at ‘home’, sent the ‘local’ crowd into raptures, with Ravi Bishnoi (0-27) and Abhishek Sharma (1-12) also joining the party. Drafted into the XI, Washington dismissed Ben Duckett in his very first ball after the southpaw’s ambitious yet ineffective reverse sweep led to a meagre return.Varun bamboozled Brook for the second game running as the latter looked clueless facing the mystery spinner’s incoming delivery. In his last over, where Carse smashed him for two sixes, Varun disturbed the stumps once again, this time Jamie Overton falling prey.","India beat England by two wickets in second T20I at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.

CHENNAI: Stars returning to play domestic tournaments has been the hot topic of discussion in Indian cricket of late, especially with coach Gautam Gambhir and the BCCI making it clear that domestic outings are a must for those who want to play for India.Varun Chakravarthy , a key component of India’s T20I set-up, on Friday echoed Gambhir’s views, emphasising that consistently featuring for his state side Tamil Nadu in white-ball competitions has contributed to his growth as a spinner. “Definitely, it gives me the rhythm (before joining the India team). The level in domestic cricket is extremely high. I would say that it is almost on par with the IPL and the international matches that we play,” said Varun on the eve of the second India-England T20I here.Varun finished as the second-highest wicket-taker in the recent Vijay Hazare Trophy (50 overs) with 18 scalps in six matches and also shone in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (T20). “I would suggest to everyone to go and play the Mushtaq Ali Trophy as it is very challenging. We play on small grounds and I find it very tough playing the SMAT.“It (domestic cricket) has definitely helped me get better, be more instinctive and on my toes. It has also helped me to think correctly at the right time,” Varun said.‘Should be ready for all challenges’: Varun stressed that the bowlers must try to stay one step ahead of the batters, even though T20 has become a batter-dominated format with favourable surfaces and small-sized boundaries.“In T20s, almost everywhere, the grounds are very small. Bowlers have the challenge of bowling from smaller ends. We plan for that as well. If we say that the batters are looking to have an aggressive approach, that is how T20 is. I cannot complain or be shocked by their (England’s) approach. I am expecting it and I have certain plans for that. Let us see if they work.”The 33-year-old also said that he has been putting in the hard yards to turn into a multi-utility cricketer across levels. “I have been working on my batting for the last six to seven months. I started my preparation at Kolkata Knight Riders, with the help of Abhishek Nayar (current India assistant coach). That kind of helped me. There is still a lot of work to do.”",Varun Chakravarthy says playing for Tamil Nadu in domestic tournaments has helped his development as a spinner.

South African rising star Annerie Dercksen has been crowned the ICC Emerging Women's Cricketer of the Year for 2024, beating out tough competition from Scotland's Saskia Horley , India's Shreyanka Patil , and Ireland's Freya Sargent .Dercksen made her international debut for South Africa in January 2023 during a T20I triangular series against India and West Indies, and has been a fixture in the team ever since.While she played in five T20Is in her debut year, the all-rounder truly established herself on the international stage in 2024, making her Test and ODI debuts as well.Dercksen's impressive 2024 stats include 161 runs and 5 wickets in 17 T20Is, 60 runs in 2 Tests, and 70 runs and 6 wickets in 4 ODIs.She showed great composure with the bat, demonstrating the ability to rebuild an innings and guide a chase when needed, including a crucial 27 in South Africa's sole victory in the limited-overs series against England late in the year.As a medium pacer, Dercksen also picked up 11 wickets, showcasing her potential as a genuine all-rounder.She was a key member of South Africa's impressive run to the final of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup 2024, where they ultimately fell short against New Zealand.Dercksen maintained a strong T20I average of 32.2 and often rescued South Africa from difficult situations, while also showing the ability to increase the scoring rate despite batting in the lower order early in the year before moving up to the middle order.Her bowling was even more impressive in the longer white-ball format, with a career-best of 3/16 against England in the first ODI.She also performed well in tough Test matches against India and England, with a best of 41 in Bloemfontein, where she helped rebuild the innings with a 92-run partnership for the second wicket.In the lead-up to the Women's T20 World Cup 2024, Dercksen had limited batting opportunities in the T20I series against Pakistan, but made the most of her chance in the series decider.In the series decider, South Africa faced a daunting chase of 154 runs. The early dismissal of Tazmin Brits and Anneke Bosch retiring hurt at a crucial juncture left the team in a precarious position.However, Dercksen stepped up under pressure, delivering a scintillating unbeaten 44 off just 23 balls. Her innings featured six boundaries and two massive sixes, taking on the seasoned bowlers Nida Dar and Sadia Iqbal with remarkable confidence.Dercksen's explosive performance led South Africa to a thrilling series-clinching victory and earned her the well-deserved Player of the Match award.","Annerie Dercksen has been crowned the ICC Emerging Women's Cricketer of the Year for 2024.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu took a significant step towards the knock-out stage with a resounding 209-run win over Chandigarh in a group D match of the Ranji Trophy in Salem on Sunday.Left-arm spinners Ajith Ram and R Sai Kishore shared eight wickets between them as Chandigarh were bowled out for 193 while chasing an imposing target of 403 on the final day.Veteran Manan Vohra remained unbeaten on 100, but eight of his teammates failed to reach double digits. With 25 points from six games, Tamil Nadu now need just one point from their final group match against Jharkhand in Jamshedpur to secure their qualification for the next stage.Group D has presented some intriguing possibilities with an open-ended points table. Despite the defeat, Chandigarh remains in contention with 19 points and a final game against Chattisgarh in Raipur.They need to win outright or with a bonus point to stay in the race for the knock-out stages. A first innings lead could be insufficient for them, considering the quality of opposition in the last round for Tamil Nadu and Saurashtra.Saurashtra, which beat Delhi in just one and half days, are currently third in the table with 18 points and have the best chance of getting another seven against Assam on an under-prepared track at Rajkot.If Tamil Nadu lose their match outright and Saurashtra win with bonus points, both will be on 25 points, and the NRR will decide the outcome.As far as Delhi and Railways are concerned, they both need bonus points in theory, but that might not be enough in the end.

Seamers Mukesh Choudhary and Rajneesh Gurbani put on a stunning display as Maharashtra crushed Baroda by a massive 439 runs in their Group A Ranji Trophy match on Sunday. The result has kept the defending champions, Mumbai, in contention for the knock-out stage.Baroda's primary goal on the final day was to save the game and secure a point, as chasing the target of 617 was virtually impossible. However, they failed to do so and were bundled out for a mere 177 in 36 overs.Former CSK left-arm seamer Choudhary claimed 5 wickets for 76 runs, while Gurbani, who recently switched from Vidarbha to Maharashtra, picked up 3 for 54. Jammu and Kashmir currently lead Group A with 29 points from six games, followed by Baroda with 27 points from the same number of matches.

In a thrilling encounter at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, the Gulf Giants clinched a narrow two-wicket victory against MI Emirates in Season 3 of the ILT20 on Saturday. The win marked a crucial moment for the Giants, pushing them to fifth on the points table after a string of challenging matches.Gulf Giants fast bowler Tom Curran , reflecting on the tense finish, expressed relief at the result.

""We needed to start winning some games, so yeah, absolutely glad we got over the line there.""Curran praised the team’s bowling performance, noting their success in restricting MI Emirates. ""I thought we bowled well. We kept them to probably a par or under-par score. It’s a quick-scoring ground, and the wicket was good, so we were happy with how we bowled,"" he explained. However, he admitted the batting got a bit too close for comfort. ""Started well with the bat as well, but yeah, probably got a bit closer than we would have liked there at the end. Really pleased to get over the line.""On his own contribution, Curran said he was satisfied with his performance. ""Yeah, pleased. Happy with that. Take that for sure. First game, straight off the plane,"" he remarked.Discussing the ILT20 experience, Curran highlighted the tournament’s unique appeal. ""No, I’ve loved it. It’s a great tournament to be a part of.

McManaman on Thomas Tuchel as the new England coach

MUMBAI: Things could hardly be going any better for Liverpool at the moment, be it domestically or in Europe. The Reds sit proudly atop the standings of both, the Premier League as well as the Uefa Champions League. In the latter, they are the only team in the revamped 36-club competition to have won each of their seven games so far.It’s the kind of position not many might have expected Liverpool to be in considering the arrival of a new manager in Arne Slot last summer following the end of a successful era under Juergen Klopp. “An incredible six months”, was how former Liverpool star Steve McManaman would describe it, though, he would also strike a cautious note saying it’s “the last four months” which would ultimately count.“I think the new manager and the coaching staff have been amazing, and the players as well,” McManaman, who is in India on an invitation from Standard Chartered for the SC Cup corporate football tournament, told The Times of India here on Saturday. “I didn’t think it’d be a huge transition because the team last year were very good. Of course, Juergen leaving was a blow at the time, but the new manager has come in and the team have responded really well.”The 52-year-old former England international put the exceptional start down to the solid foundations built during the Klopp era, which, he said, have helped Slot’s cause, as well as players getting better with experience, citing the examples of Ryan Gravenberch, Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister. “The younger players have got more experience, so they’ve become better players. So all in all, I think they’ve all responded really well to the season, but I didn’t think that they’d be top of the league by six points with a game in hand and win seven from seven in the Champions League. So they’ve surprised me in that respect,” McManaman said.“When Juergen left, I think the foundations within Liverpool were exceptional, and Arne Slott has picked it up. We haven’t won any trophies yet this year, so it’s important not to go crazy. At this moment in time, he’s had an incredible six months, but the last four months are the most important months, starting with the League Cup second leg in a couple of weeks time against Tottenham (Liverpool lost the away leg 1-0).”But could the uncertainty surrounding the futures of key players like Mohamed Salah , Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk be a stumbling block in the path of a team, who, according to McManaman, have the depth to “conceivably do the quadruple”?“The Mo Salah situation, Trent, Virgil van Dijk doesn’t bother me in the least. It won’t distract them. As a professional footballer, you want to be successful,” McManaman, a former Champions League winning midfielder with Real Madrid, said, adding: “In 2021, we had Mo Salah, (Roberto) Firmino and Sadio Mane in the same situation and they were going for the quadruple that year as well. So, no, I don’t think the contract situation is an issue at all.“I think Mo Salah wants to win every single trophy he can, including the Ballon d’or, including the leading goalscorer, the Golden Boot. So he won’t be thinking about his contract situation. That’s just secondary.”As well as it’s going at Anfield, it’s a different picture playing out at the Etihad, where defending champions Manchester City, the club which marked the final stop in McManaman’s playing career, are attempting to salvage their season after experiencing a shocking slump.While some pundits believe the long-term ACL injury suffered by Ballon d’Or winner Rodri has laid bare City’s lack of midfield recruitment in recent transfer windows, McManaman said the negative run could not be explained by the Spaniard’s absence alone.“I think it's a number of things. You can't lose games just because you lose one football player. I think Kevin de Bruyne was out at the same time, which didn't help. They had a number of issues defensively, which didn't help. And when I spoke about Liverpool getting a year more experience, the young kids getting a year older, maybe the Manchester City players are just getting older, that's all!“They've set such a high benchmark over the last four years, five years, that any decline is jumped upon. I still think they'll qualify for the Champions League (playoffs). They need to beat Club Brugge (on Wednesday). If they do that, they'll qualify and then you'll see probably a different Manchester City team. But, yeah, it's only because their standards have been incredibly high that any dip is pounced upon by the media,” said McManaman.“I personally would prefer an English manager to manage England. I know the FA did not speak to Eddie Howe. I know they didn't speak to Graham Potter. I know they didn't speak to a number of English players which was surprising. They thought Thomas Tuchel was the best man for the job, so fair enough, and I hope he wins the World Cup, I hope he's successful. But the fact that he's only got an 18-month contract suggests that after the World cup he might leave if he doesn't win the World Cup. So I don't know what the ins and outs is, but my personal preference would have been an English manager to represent the English national team.”",Steve McManaman says Liverpool have had an 'incredible six months' The former England international is in India for the SC Cup corporate football tournament.

CHENNAI: Manchester City ’s form has been poor to say the least. With the 4-2 defeat at Paris St Germain in the Champions League , City, also struggling in the Premier League , find themselves in a precarious situation. They have to win their final CL league match to advance to the next round.In the absence of defensive midfielder Rodri, City have lacked control and stability in the middle of the park. Former defensive mid-fielder Paul Lambert, who was a key figure in Borussia Dortmund’s CL triumph in the 1996-97 season, spoke about what Rodri brings to the table.“Losing Rodri was definitely a blow as he plays in a specialised position. Rodri played a massive role in City’s success last season and was rewarded with the Ballon d’Or,” Lambert said on the sideline of the Murugap-pa Youth Academy (MYFA) training on Thursday.Lambert further mentioned that many have been very critical of Guardiola, and he feels that it should not be the case. “In the last seven years or so, City under Pep have been incredible. While City are having a tough time, I do not think anybody can be really too critical.”Lambert had a huge role to play for Dortmund in his short one-year spell.

A worried Mohammedan SC coach Andrey Chernyshov is standing in the middle of the Salt Lake Stadium practice ground, in deep discussion with club football secretary Dipendu Biswas .Not far, assistant coach Mehrajuddin Wadoo is talking on his cellphone. And inside the dressing room, club officials are busy trying to convince the players to come out the middle for training. In three days’ time, they are scheduled to play Mumbai City FC . But they have to make the journey first.This, in a nutshell, was the Indian Super League debutants’ first home training session on Thursday, eight days after holding Chennaiyin FC 2-2 in the league. Chernyshov’s boys are going through perhaps the best phase in their first season. They may be placed last in the table now but are unbeaten in their past four matches.Off the field, however, they are staring at a crisis, with the players threatening to boycott training reportedly over unpaid wages and forcing the club officials to step in to avoid a potential dressingroom revolt twice in the past 10 days. Ahead of the match against Chennaiyin FC on Jan 15 too, club officials had to coax the players to take the field. At the heart of this apparent player unrest lies a tug-of-war between the club and its investors Bunkerhill and Shrachi Sports over transfer of shares.Gurugram-based Bunkerhill, which invested heavily in the club since 2020 and played akey role in the team’s promotion to the ISL , owns 61% stake in Mohammedan Sporting Club Pvt Ltd. Bunkerhill is supposed to hand over 50% of its shares to Shrachi, which joined the company as an investor in Aug last year.It has been understood that Bunkerhill has sent a notice asking the club to transfer this 61% share (apparently promised as per the agreement) by the end of this month, threatening to suspend further funding otherwise. Shrachi, claiming to be “caught in a crossfire” between the club and Bunkerhill, has also stopped its funding in the company.This financial turmoil has left the players in a limbo — with some players reportedly claiming to have unpaid salary for around three months. Players of the club’s cricket team have also joined the protest, shooting off a hand-written letter to the club president alleging that they didn’t receive any payment for the ongoing season.",Mohammedan SC players threaten to boycott training over unpaid wages.

Alexander Zverev 's loss in the Australian Open final on Sunday was followed by a startling moment during the trophy ceremony.As Zverev stood at the microphone, a person in the stadium repeatedly shouted the names of two of his ex-girlfriends who have accused him of physical abuse in the past, saying ""Australia believes"" them.The crowd's reaction was mixed, with some booing and whistling in response to the interruption. At his post-match press conference, Zverev was asked about the incident.""I believe there are no more accusations,"" Zverev responded. ""There haven't been for — what? — nine months now. ... I think I've done everything I can, and I'm not about to open that subject again.""Last June, as Zverev reached the French Open final , news emerged that a Berlin district court had ended a trial stemming from a woman's accusation of domestic violence during a 2020 argument. The resolution was reached with the agreement of state prosecutors and lawyers for Zverev and his former partner.Zverev had previously denied another assault allegation made by a different woman. The ATP investigated her claims and stated in January 2023 that there was insufficient evidence.","Alexander Zverev lost to Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open final.

The Times of India in Melbourne:

Madison Keys walked into her post-championship media interaction in black tights and a blue tee, wearing her wholesome halo.The Australian Open champion took a sip of the celebratory bubbly and spoke eloquently about shifting goal posts, development tools, and the importance of therapy. ""I think everyone needs therapy,"" she said.Keys was all of 11 when she was first talked of as a future Grand Slam champion, at that point it was music to her ears. The American -- Rock Island, Illinois-born -- turned pro on her 14th birthday and made her WTA debut a few weeks later. Keys, already 5 ft 10 and clocking 115 mph serves, entered the Grand Slam field for the first time at Melbourne Park as an 18-year-old, the following year she stormed into her first major semifinal, at the Australian Open. In 2017, three years later, she made the US Open final.Keys, who dug deep in her media conference, said the talk around her as a child was meant to be confidence-building, an exercise in positivity.""Then you are older, you're in the later stages of your career and it kind of feels like, will this ever happen? If it doesn't happen, I didn't live up to what everyone told me I should have done,"" Keys said. ""It went from being something positive to something that (triggered) a little bit of panic. It started to kind of weigh on me. What if I never do it? If I don’t do it, am I considered a failure?""The American, who married her coach Bjorn Fratangelo , 31, acknowledged the load she was carrying was heavy.Keys, whose ranking slipped out of the top-20 late last year, was forced to look at herself in the mirror.""I finally got to the point where I was proud of myself and proud of my career, with or without a Grand Slam,"" she said, looking at the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup. ""I didn't need it to feel like I had a good career.""Shrugging off that weight allowed Keys to go all-out on the court and win a Grand Slam.Keys, who on Saturday became the oldest player to defeat the World No.1 and No.2 in the semifinal and final at a Grand Slam event since the WTA rankings were published in 1975, said she owed her turnaround to lots of therapy.Keys, soon to be 30, is the lowest-seeded player (No.19) to win the Australian Open in the Open Era.The American, who turns 30 in a few weeks, went the sports therapy route initially, looking to nail results. Then Keys started digging, she asked herself tough questions, what did she feel about herself?""Getting help and talking to someone not just about tennis, but about how I felt about myself, again, very uncomfortable. I never really like to be uncomfortable,"" Keys said, she was speaking for a majority. ""(But) had I not done that, I wouldn't be sitting here.""The trigger stirred when Keys had got to a point where she started to feel low and didn’t really care about tennis and results, she just wanted to feel better. She was aching to exhale.""For a long time I had this idea that people were able to ignore their nerves and just tunnel vision,"" she said. ""It was a light bulb moment (when I realized) I can be nervous and I can still play good tennis. Those things can live together. I stopped fighting, trying to push away the feelings and pretending that they're not there and just accepting them.""Keys pointed out that the stigma around therapy was starting to go away.""Everyone should be in therapy, no matter what,"" she said with a smile. ""No matter what's going on in your life, you're going to have moments where things are tough and you need someone to talk to. It's something I will continue to do for the rest of my life.""Keys, flaunting a normalcy that was enviable, might be the new standard in sport.",Madison Keys won the Australian Open on Saturday. She is the lowest-seeded player (No.19) to win the tournament in the Open Era.

TimesofIndia.com in Melbourne:

Professional sport is decided by moments. By sudden change in momentum. By luck. By one wicket. By one boundary. By one jab. By one point. The margins between win and loss, joy and sorrow, could well be just that. Years and years of hard work could well be decided by these small facets. How you play that one delivery coming at you at 150 kmph. How well you land that 150 kmph in the first place. How, if at all, you duck that right hook. How you play that forehand when down match point. Or, conversely, play the big points – such as a match point – when you've got lots at stake. Madison Keys and Aryna Sabalenka had plenty at stake when they took court in front of tens of thousands of people at the Rod Laver Arena on Saturday. A $3.5 million prize cheque. 2000 ranking points. Opportunity to lift the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup. Accolades.Sabalenka had done these things before already, though. Twice (in 2023 and 2024). She was going for a three-peat at Melbourne Park. No one had won three in a row here since Martina Hingis in 1999. She had had a largely uneventful run to the title match. Except for the tricky second set, under stiff conditions, against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the quarter-final, things had gone smoothly and as per plan.Keys, meanwhile, had ticked none of those boxes. Her last run to a major final was eight years ago – the longest gap between first two women's singles Grand Slam finals. She had not been in the top 10 for two years. And her run to the final was laden with high-profile wins – against World No. 10 Danielle Collins, World No. 6 Elena Rybakina, World No. 28 Elena Svitolina and World No. 2 Iga Swiatek . Against Swiatek, Keys was required to save a match point.On Saturday, Keys started and ended well. She broke Sabalenka in the very first game and to complete the full circle, did that once again in what was the eventual 38th game of the two-hour contest. In the moments that mattered, the miniscule bits in the grand scheme of things, Keys was braver and hit bigger shots against Sabalenka, considered one of the biggest and boldest hitters in women's tennis.In the seventh game of the decisive third set, Keys served at 30-30. The crowd was aware of the magnitude of the point as the intensity and decibel level went up. If it went Sabalenka's way, she would have a break point to create a match-changing lead. Instead, Keys served wide to the forehand and punched a winner on the return to the other side of the court. Next point, a mirror image of it with a backhand winner.Fast forward four games, it was 5-5 and 30-30, the sun had set over the Melbourne skyline and the twilight had made way for a clear and cool night. Keys bounced the ball to serve and the nerves, if any, were not quite visible for either player. They were dialled in, as you need to in professional sport from start to finish. One miscalculation, one mishit, any passivity and it could be curtains. Keys, though, was in the zone. She got down low to a deep return and diverted the ball into the corner for a winner. Next point, same direction for a similar outcome and she had pushed the envelope in Sabalenka's side.The Belarusian, who had started the match poorly, especially on serve, had regained control. But, as already mentioned, we were in small margins territory now. ""Squeaky bum time,"" as legendary Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson referred to it. Four points separated Keys from the title. Sabalenka started by sending her forehand long on a mishit. Make that three. On the second, Keys romped to a little kick serve for a backhand winner. Two more to get. Sabalenka erred on the forehand a point later and it was Championship point. The World No. 1 saved one. Could she prolong the edge-of-the-seat encounter, everyone wondered. Many neutrals in the Rod Laver Arena hoped. Instead, Keys went inside out on the forehand once and then again, the first one came back but the second one didn't. 'Maddy' had done it!Keys was the 2025 Australian Open champion. Her first-ever Grand Slam title, 16 years after turning pro. The 30-year-old became the fourth oldest first-time Grand Slam winner. When the rankings are updated on Monday, she would match her career-best World No. 7 ranking.The contrast in emotions was visible across the net. Keys erupted with smiles, joy, and sheer disbelief. She made her way to her team and exchanged hugs with everyone, including husband and coach Bjorn Fratangelo, whom she married only eight weeks ago.For Sabalenka, meanwhile, it was bewilderment – at the outcome, the tennis she displayed and most problematically, she acknowledged, with her humility of the situation. The racket bore the brunt of that. She bumbled to her box and coaches, with whom she shares a great relationship filled with laughter and banter, as she made her way to the net for the customary handshake – or hug in this case. The 27-year-old then smacked her racket on the ground and walked off to the locker room.""There definitely was a bit of frustration because I was so close to achieve [achieving] something crazy. When you're out there, you're fighting, but it seems like everything [was] going not the way you really want [it] to go. I just needed to throw those negative emotions at the end just so I could give a speech, not stand there being disrespectful. I was just trying to let it go and be a good person, be respectful,"" she said in the post-match media interaction with a laugh. ""I was stand [standing] there and just was like, ‘Okay, c'mon, you've been in her position. She deserves that. She was [a] better player than you.' Just, you know, it was tough,"" added Sabalenka.During the first set and start of the second, Sabalenka would look at her box repeatedly, mumble something, and continue. Things were not going her way and Keys deserved most of the credit for that. If the serve was faltering, it was because it had come under the pump from the word go. The American, who had won the Australian Open warm-up event in Adelaide, had come out quickly off the blocks and was sending deep groundstrokes to counter Sabalenka's game of dominating proceedings with her sheer power. The Belarusian, who has three major titles on hard courts, looked clueless.She later said, at this point in her career, it was ""trophy or nothing"".""Nobody remembers the finalist, you know? Nobody puts, like, next to the winner [the] finalist's name,"" she said with a smile. ""I mean, at this point, yeah, I go for titles. But, of course, I have to be proud of myself with the finals, three finals in the row. That's something crazy. I hope that next year I'll come back as a better player, and I'll hold Daphne one more time,"" she stated.",Madison Keys beat Aryna Sabalenka in straight sets to win Australian Open. The World No. 1 became the fourth Grand Slam winner of her career. Keys is the first woman to win the title in Melbourne since Martina Hingis in 1999.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117575700,imgsize-172866,width-400,resizemode-4/117575700.jpg"

Jannik Sinner acknowledges the formidable athleticism of Alexander Zverev as he aims to achieve consecutive Australian Open victories, a feat accomplished by only a select few, in a final that showcases the two highest-ranked players globally.Darren Cahill, who coaches Sinner, acknowledged the significant challenge presented by Zverev's intense determination to secure his first Grand Slam title.""He's a physical beast,"" Cahill said. ""He's put those years of work into his body. He is a great athlete and has a great five-set record.

His primary objective has been to achieve optimal physical conditioning, enabling him to compete effectively against top-tier opponents such as Sinner and Alcaraz.""I think I said it also after the French Open final, I got tired against Carlos. I simply got tired in the fourth and fifth set,"" he said.""Yes, there were some unlucky moments. In general, I got tired, and I didn't want that to happen this year anymore.""Look, I think Jannik has been the best player in the world for the past 12 months,"" he added.

: Tears flowed unabashedly on both sides of the net on Rod Laver Arena. Ecstasy and agony.Madison Keys -- with an eight year gap between her first and second Grand Slam finals, the longest in the Open Era – sobbed tears of disbelief when she hugged her team, particularly her husband and coach Bjorn Fratengelo. For a while it looked like the couple, who got married seven weeks ago, didn’t want to let go, but the American had just clinched the biggest prize of her life, the Australian Open title, and her story might only have just begun.Across the court, Aryna Sabalenka , going for a historic third successive crown at Melbourne Park, had just fallen short, she was broken. She covered her head with a towel and sobbed uncontrollably. The world No.1, who had crushed 29 winners in the match, smashed her racket on the court after embracing Keys at the net.Keys, the 29-year-old, won the two-hour, two-minute final 6-3, 2-6, 7-5 and took home $3,500,000 while Sabalenka, who had secured the No.1 ranking by making the final, was richer by $1,900,000.Keys, the 19th seed, went on to give one of the most touching winner’s speeches, asking Melbourne Park to bear with her because she was going to cry.“I have wanted this for so long,” she said, clutching the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup, handed to her by the legendary Aussie Evonne Goolagong Cawley “I have been in one other Grand Slam final and it did not go my way and I didn’t know if I was ever going to get back to this position to try to win a trophy again.”“My team believed in me every step of the way, they believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself. Last year was so tough, with some really bad injuries, I didn’t know if I was going to be able to do it again,” said Keys, who’ll climb to No.7 in the rankings on Monday, matching her career-best number.“To be here and have this trophy, and my husband (and coach), who is looking confused over there, I love you too. I want to say thank you to every single person who helped me push on to achieve this dream,” she said, before looking at the crowd, “Thank you so much, I cannot wait to see you all next year.”In the title match, Sabalenka, who oscillated between going all-out and holding back, just a tad, for the first hour of play, broke loose just as the sun came down over the bay at Melbourne.The 26-year-old steadied the ship, mixing it up with some sweetly timed dropshots that caught the American short. Keys, who says Sabalenka’s play and mentality has been a reference point for her, held (2-5) to make her opponent serve out the second set and the world No.1 made no mistake.For Keys -- playing with a heavy strapping on her left leg -- it was the fourth straight three-setter, and the fifth of the championship, while Sabalenka had only dropped one set en route to the final. The duo held serve in the decider, going toe-to-toe for the first 11 games, until Keys broke in the 12th, on her second match point to claim victory.Sabalenka, known for her bruising play, was honest in her post-championship media conference.The world No.1 explained that she had crushed her rackets to get rid of her frustration before the presentation ceremony.Sabalenka said, for her, at this stage of her career, it was the trophy or nothing. “Nobody remembers the finalist,” she said with a laugh that didn’t quite catch her eye.“There definitely was a bit of frustration because I was so close to achieving something crazy,” she said. “I just needed to throw those negative emotions at the end just so I could give a speech, not stand there being disrespectful. I'm the one who knows that after tough losses, there are good wins.”Sabalenka, who left Rod Laver Arena for a few minutes, said she needed some time for herself.“I needed to switch off and forget. I was standing there saying, okay, come on, you've been in her position. She deserves that. She was a better player than you,” Sabalenka said before adding, “It was tough.”","Madison Keys beats Aryna Sabalenka 6-3, 2-6, 7-5 in Australian Open final.

MELBOURNE: Aryna Sabalenka is a towering personality with a ginormous game. The Belarusian’s USP is her ability to play high-voltage tennis at all times. Sabalenka goes mostly with instinct, but her game isn’t without tactics.The forehand cross-court, used to draw opponents wide, has given an edge to her returns, and has been perfected over the past year. Not enough is said about the 26-year-old’s flawless footwork, getting her into position to play her shots.Her play is so big, Madison Keys of the US will look to top that in Saturday’s women’s final, where Sabalenka will be going for a three-peat. The defending champion and world No. 1 thought it was just ‘crazy’ that she had put herself in a position to win three successive Australian titles and fix her name alongside the sport’s legends.Swiss Martina Hingis is the last woman to achieve that feat, from 1997 to 1999. It’s no surprise that Sabalenka, the Minsk-born Miami resident, called Melbourne Park ‘home’.“I feel good here, I feel the support, this year even more. I feel like I’m coming to my home slam,” said. “I know everything, I know every area, I know where to warm up so it’s not that crowded. I go (out) there and I feel people screaming my name. I have goosebumps every time they scream, ‘Let’s go, Aryna!’.”Keys, seeded 19, playing her first final here, applauded Sabalenka’s mentality.“She plays such fearless tennis,” she said.",Aryna Sabalenka is the defending champion and world No. 1.

The Times of India in Melbourne:

After two hours and 36 minutes of breaking down Ben Shelton ’s incendiary play while battling cramps, world No. 1 Jannik Sinner turned to his team when the American’s backhand found the net on match point.Sinner grit his teeth and clenched his fist. It was that kind of a performance.The Italian came through 7-6 (2), 6-2, 6-2, making his second successive final here in a match in which Shelton’s level rode the roller-coaster — the 22-year-old had 55 unforced errors, which shouldn’t sum the match for him, but it does.The first set hit dizzying heights, just as well that the roof on Rod Laver Arena was open. The left-handed Shelton stepped up to the plate superbly, matching the world No. 1 shot for shot, meeting flat with flatter, spin with slice and pace with power.For 71 minutes and 94 points, it was hard to pick the numero uno and the 20th ranked player apart.The 22-year-old American broke early for a 2-0 lead, but the defending champion hit back and levelled at 2-2 even though he looked anything but settled on the court.It was Shelton then who broke in the 11th game and looked set to wrap up the set in the following game with two set points on his serve, but Sinner broke back and took hold of the tie-break and the match.Then, when the top seed jumped to a 4-0 lead in the second set, it showed that Shelton of the sparkling talent was still relatively new in the pro game.Shelton, who had the trainer work on his quads at the end of the second set, had the crowd on his side. From shouts of ‘Come on Shelton! Make America Great Again’, there was fair support for the World No. 1 too, lending to the atmosphere.Shelton had chances to break the Sinner serve in the second and fourth games of the third sets, but it was the Italian, battling cramps, who broke in the fifth game.At the change of ends, Sinner got his hamstring attended to by the physio. Sinner, clearly struggling with movement, decided to swing at everything and broke at love, before serving out the match.","World No. 1 Jannik Sinner beat American Ben Shelton 7-6 (2), 6-2,6-2.

Road to the final for Aryna Sabalenka

Road to the final for Madison Keys

Milestones to be achieved

Sabalenka is aiming for a historic three-peat at the Australian Open, a feat last accomplished by Hingis from 1997 to 1999. A victory would also give her a fourth Grand Slam title.

If successful, Sabalenka would become the first woman to win three consecutive hard-court Grand Slam titles this century, following Hingis, who won the 1997 Australian Open, the 1997 US Open, and the 1998 Australian Open. Only three women in the Open Era have achieved three consecutive hard-court majors, and Sabalenka could join Graf, Seles, and Hingis in this exclusive club.

On the other hand, Keys is vying to become the first first-time Grand Slam singles champion since Coco Gauff at the 2023 US Open. This would be her second title of the season and her tenth overall.

Having already defeated No. 2 Swiatek, Keys aims to become the first player to beat both the World No. 1 and No. 2 in a Grand Slam since Svetlana Kuznetsova at the 2009 Roland Garros and the first at the Australian Open since Serena Williams in 2005.

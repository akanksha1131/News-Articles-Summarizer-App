'We will try and win this for Virat Kohli': Rajat Patidar before IPL Final

Poll Did Shreyas Iyer's leadership positively impact the PBKS squad? Absolutely Somewhat Not really Not at all





As Shashank Singh walked off the field following his 61*(30) in the IPL 2025 final, Shreyas Iyer was among the first to offer solace. Punjab Kings (PBKS) fell short by just six runs, which would have definitely hurt Shreyas, who had earlier shared that winning means everything to him. A win on Tuesday at the Narendra Modi Stadium would've made him the first captain to win two consecutive IPL titles with two different teams.This season, Shreyas had showcased selflessness of the highest order with the way he spearheaded an inexperienced PBKS squad to the final. The Mohali-based franchise had finished ninth in the previous edition and had not qualified for the playoffs in 11 years.While Priyansh Arya and Josh Inglis were featuring in the IPL for the first time, the likes of Nehal Wadhera and Azmatullah Omarzai also had limited experience. Shreyas had to further deal with the exits of Glenn Maxwell and Lockie Ferguson due to injuries. The PBKS setup suffered a major setback in the playoffs following the unavailability of South African all-rounder Marco Jansen, who left the squad due to the World Test Championship (WTC) final.Shreyas navigated all the challenges with his ice-cold calmness, maintaining confidence through thick and thin. There was constant emphasis on making the players feel secure by backing them despite failures.Priyansh enjoyed quality backing despite periods of inconsistency. The show of confidence powered the 24-year-old to score 475 runs at a strike rate of 179.24 in his maiden IPL season. Shreyas further empowered opener Prabhsimran Singh to realise his true potential following a topsy-turvy run in the past. Prabhsimran emerged as the highest-scoring uncapped player in IPL 2025, smashing 549 runs in 17 matches at a strike rate of 160.52.m ""Shreyas talks to me like a friend. He says, 'Just play in the manner which suits you',"" said Arya.Even Wadhera and Shashank made their presence felt, bringing solidity to the middle and lower order. One of Wadhera's most prominent performances came in 'Qualifier 2', where he smashed 48 off 29 balls, enabling PBKS to chase down 204 against MI. Shashank brought explosiveness and experience down the order, stepping up whenever promoted as well.However, the most impressive aspect of Shreyas' captaincy was the way he batted. The PBKS captain amassed 604 runs at an average of 50.33.Shreyas' tally of 39 sixes in IPL 2025 is the second-highest number of sixes registered by an Indian batter in an IPL season. The PBKS captain showcased a batting masterclass in the second qualifier, delivering a beautiful amalgamation of aggression and composure during his unbeaten 87 off 41 balls. The Punjab-based franchise has been quite entertaining under Shreyas, notably smashing more than 200 runs in seven IPL 2025 matches. PBKS hit 173 sixes during the season—an impressive tally compared to second-placed Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), who accumulated 152 sixes.""Shreyas has real hunger in his eyes to do well. He wants to evolve and develop into the best leader and captain that he can be,"" said PBKS head coach Ricky Ponting.Shreyas is known for his ability to perform magic tricks, which certainly reflected in the transformation of the bowling department. The same team which once struggled to defend large totals showcased immense composure to pull off wins comprehensively.While Arshdeep Singh (21 wickets) and Jansen (16 wickets) made their presence felt, Shreyas backed Chahal (16 wickets) despite expensive spells. The spinner repaid the faith, especially in a league match against KKR, picking four wickets as PBKS defended 112.Shreyas' tactical acumen further stood out in his crafty utilisation of Vyshak Vijaykumar, with the pacer's variations frustrating batters. Vyshak bowled wide yorkers in the Eliminator against GT, delivering knuckle-balls craftily in the second qualifier, which made a big difference.While Shreyas is certainly a great teammate, he is also stern about maintaining top-notch standards. The PBKS captain lashed out at Shashank following his clumsy run-out in the second qualifier, showcasing the emphasis on being competitive.",Shreyas Iyer captained Punjab Kings to the IPL 2025 final in Jaipur. PBKS lost to Mumbai Indians by six runs. Iyer is the first captain to win two consecutive IPL titles with two different teams. Shreyas is known for his ability to perform magic tricks.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121649613,imgsize-176626,width-400,resizemode-4/121649613.jpg"

'A particularly special feeling': Andy Flower hails Virat Kohli, RCB after historic title win





NEW DELHI: A chilling old warning issued by a Chennai Super Kings (CSK) fan club in 2024 has resurfaced and gone viral in the wake of the tragic stampede during Royal Challengers Bengaluru's (RCB) IPL 2025 victory celebrations that left several people dead and many others injured. RCB clinched their maiden IPL title by defeating Punjab Kings in the 2025 final, prompting massive celebrations in Bengaluru. However, what should have been a historic moment for the franchise turned into a disaster as a stampede broke out during the team’s celebratory parade, resulting in loss of lives and widespread injuries.In the aftermath of the tragedy, fans on social media have revived a 2024 post from a CSK fan account, which had warned about the lack of safety for women and families at Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru during IPL matches.""To our fans who came and supported us today at Bangalore. Hope you reached home safe! Forever grateful for your love and support! However, with the treatment we witnessed towards all the women, children and families, this is shambles. This is not the Bengaluru we knew. What we can say is that Bengaluru is NOT safe for any women to watch an IPL game in Chinnaswamy if you are not part of the local fandom.The security and fan behaviour is a letdown beyond words and imagination,"" the original post from 2024 had stated.Now, in light of the recent tragedy, the same fan account has reposted their warning, expressing frustration over how their earlier concerns were dismissed.“Lot of engagement from fans on this old tweet. Yes, we did raise concerns about security and safety back in 2024! Instead of the RCB management acknowledging the problem and facing it, trolls came for defence with responses like ‘where is the proof’, ‘sore losers’, ‘use burnol’, ‘sympathy’, ‘this is not harassment’, and what not!""Unfortunately, what happened in 2025 could have been easily avoided if only there was responsibility, attitude, and intention to acknowledge reality!” the CSK fan club posted on Thursday.The resurfaced post has sparked a fresh debate on fan behaviour, security lapses, and event management during high-profile cricket events in India — raising difficult questions for RCB and local authorities to answer.IPL champions RCB announced a financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh each for the families of the 11 supporters, who lost their lives in a stampede outside the Chinnaswamy Stadium during the team's IPL victory celebrations.""The unfortunate incident in Bengaluru yesterday has caused a lot of anguish and pain to the RCB family,"" RCB issued a statement on social media on Thursday.""As a mark of respect and a gesture of solidarity, RCB has announced a financial support of Rs 10 lakh to each of the eleven families of the deceased. In addition, a fund called RCB Cares is also being created to support fans injured in this tragic incident,"" it added.More than 50 people were injured in the incident.","IPL champions RCB announced a financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh each for the families of the 11 supporters, who lost their lives in a stampede outside the Chinnaswamy Stadium during the team's victory celebrations.

'We will try and win this for Virat Kohli': Rajat Patidar before IPL Final





Former India opener Virender Sehwag has made an interesting comparison between Virat Kohli's wait for winning the first IPL trophy and Sachin Tendulkar lifting the ODI World Cup in 2011.""Kohli's wait to win the trophy for only 11 years. Sachin Tendulkar waited from 1989 till 2011. So, Kohli's wait for lesser, and still even Sachin never lost hope. He had made up his mind, he would only bow out with a World Cup trophy in his hand,"" Sehwag told Cricbuzz.Sehwag also emphasized that after retiring from Tests and T20Is, Kohli will be a relieved person.“It's the same for Virat Kohli. Now, he can be relieved. He can happily stop playing IPL whenever he wants to make that decision. A player plays to win the trophy. Money comes and goes, but winning trophies isn't easy. And even as Kohli's wait ended, he has still made a very strong contribution in their campaign,” said Sehwag.Kohli finished the IPL 2025 with 657, the most by a RCB batter. e averaged 54.75 while scoring with a strike rate of 144.71.Hundreds of thousands had packed the streets Wednesday to welcome home their hero Kohli and the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) after they had beaten Punjab Kings a day earlier in a thrilling Indian Premier League final.But the euphoria of the vast crowds in the southern tech city of Bengaluru ended in disaster.Karnataka state Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said most of the 11 dead were young people and there were 47 others injured in the crush after a stampede near the city's M. Chinnaswamy cricket stadium, where the players were parading the trophy for fans.Kohli, who top scored in the final, said earlier it had been ""as much for the fans"" after the 36-year-old finally celebrated winning the IPL at his 18th attempt.Later, Kohli wrote on social media: ""At a loss for words.""Absolutely gutted,"" he added, alongside a statement from the RCB team saying they were ""deeply anguished"" at what had unfolded.","Virender Sehwag compares Virat Kohli's wait for winning IPL trophy to Sachin Tendulkar's 11-year wait to lift ODI World Cup.

He's just off a few paces, but that's been a great sign,"" Wright said.""So, he's on the road to recovery.

'A particularly special feeling': Andy Flower hails Virat Kohli, RCB after historic title win





NEW DELHI: Legendary cricketer Kapil Dev on Thursday expressed his anguish over the death of 11 fans during Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s IPL victory celebrations, saying “lives are more important than celebration” and urging everyone to take proper precautions in the future.On Wednesday, nearly two and a half lakh people gathered near the M Chinnaswamy Stadium to catch a glimpse of their cricketing heroes. However, the resulting chaos led to a stampede that claimed 11 lives and left several others injured.“I feel very bad about that. I think we have to learn from each other. Next time something like this (victory parade) happens, people should be more conscious. People do make a mistake,” Kapil told PTI.The 1983 World Cup-winning captain also urged teams and organisers to act responsibly while planning events of such scale.“Mistake should not be to that scale where you are having fun and you lose lives. In the future, if any team wins, keep it calm. Lives are more important than celebration. Let’s put it that way,” he added.Looking ahead, Kapil hoped that India would emerge victorious during the upcoming five-match Test tour of England.“They are a good side. Cricket is a team game and if they play as a team then they will get good results. Whether it is Shubman Gill or Jasprit Bumrah... it is not about individuals, play as a team. That’s more important. Good luck to them, and hope they come back victorious,” he said.Now away from competitive cricket, Kapil revealed he has found a new sporting passion in golf — both as a player and an administrator.“I think cricket can be played only up to a certain age, you know, certain sports like tennis, football, you can’t play at the age of 50 or 60. But when I started playing golf, I felt that one can play, as long as you want. And that’s wonderful, as a sportsman, if you keep on playing something.“Golf has given me that kick, that I can compete with myself,” said the 66-year-old, who also serves as the president of the Professional Golf Tour of India.",Legendary cricketer Kapil Dev expresses anguish over the death of 11 fans during Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s victory celebrations.

Portugal secured a 2-1 comeback victory against Germany in their Nations League semifinal in Munich on Wednesday. While the side by Cristiano Ronaldo made it to their second final in the history of the competition, it was their 40-year-old skipper scoring his 137th international goal to become the oldest player to score against Germany that grabbed all the headlines.Ronaldo's goal came five minutes after substitute Francisco Conceicao equalized with a powerful shot in the 63rd minute, helping Portugal overcome their initial deficit and ending Ronaldo's personal losing streak against Germany.Florian Wirtz had given Germany the lead in the 48th minute with a precise header inside the right post, but Portugal coach Roberto Martinez's strategic substitutions proved decisive.Champions League winner Vitinha, who helped Paris Saint-Germain triumph against Inter Milan at the same stadium just four days earlier, made a significant impact after coming on as a substitute. German goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen stood his ground to prevent Portugal from extending their lead further.PSG wing backs Joao Neves and Nuno Mendes were in the starting line-up for Portugal, while Nick Woltemade made his debut start for Germany.Conceicao made an immediate impact after coming on, scoring with an impressive long-range strike past Robin Gosens. Mendes then provided the assist for Ronaldo's comfortable finish five minutes later. The Al-Nassr man was in the right place to guide the pass from his teammate into an empty net.While Portugal have already booked their spot in the final, they will have to wait to know who they are to face in the title decider.

PATHUM THANI (THAILAND): A lacklustre India lost 0-2 against Thailand in an international football friendly in a reality check ahead of their crucial Asian Cup qualifying round match on Wednesday.Benjamin Davis and Poramet Arjvilai scored for Thailand in the 8th and 59th minute respectively as the home side dominated the match at the Thammasat Stadium.India had won the last two matches between the two sides before Wednesday's defeat but Thailand, ranked 99th in the world, were clearly the better side on the day.India are currently ranked a lowly 127th.The talismanic Sunil Chhetri , who had scored twice in India's 4-1 win against Thailand in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, nearly scored in the 24th minute but his glancing header was saved by a diving Thailand goalkeeper Saranon Anui.India had also beaten Thailand 1-0 in the Kings Cup in 2019.Thailand were technically bettered equipped and more clinical while India were left ruing missed opportunities and costly defensive lapses. The Indian midfield also lacked creativity.This was the Indian team's second defeat in seven matches under head coach Manolo Marquez, the last one being 0-3 loss to Syria in the Intercontinental Cup last year in Hyderabad.Out of the five remaining matches under his charge, four were drawn games while the lone win came against Maldives (3-0) in March in an international friendly.Thailand made their early dominance count. Phitiwat Sookjitthammakul found Korawich Tasa near the edge of the Indian box in the eighth minute. Tasa smartly laid it off for Ben Davis, who took a deft first touch to steady himself before unleashing a thunderous right-footed shot past Indian goalkeeper Vishal Kaith.It was Davis’ fourth goal in seven appearances for Thailand, and the Indian backline was left exposed, reacting too late to close him down.India gradually grew into the game, using the width of the pitch to stretch the Thailand defence. Liston Colaco, operating fluently between midfield and the left flank, was a standout performer, linking up well with Sunil Chhetri and forward Ashique Kuruniyan.India's first opportunity to level the score in the first half came in the 24th minute. Colaco delivered a teasing free-kick from the left which Chhetri met with a clever header, timing his run perfectly to get ahead of his marker. However, Thailand goalkeeper Saranon Anuin dived to his left to pull off a sharp save.Thailand continued to pose threat on the Indian citadel, with long-range efforts from Korawich Tasa and Arjvilai narrowly missing the target.The momentum began to shift slightly in India’s favour as the half wore on. Abhishek came close with a driven shot from distance that missed the horizontal by inches in the 40th minute.But the golden opportunity arrived in first-half stoppage time. Chhetri played a sublime through ball from midfield to find Colaco’s run, splitting the Thai defence. Colaco brought the ball under control but couldn’t finish the one-on-one chance as Anuin narrowed the angle to eventually thwart the danger with a timely save.In the 59th minute, a miss pass in the midfield gifted Thailand ball possession. The ball was quickly fed to Arjvilai on the left flank. Spotting Vishal Kaith slightly off his line after sidestepping Ashish Rai, Arjvilai curled a magnificent effort into the top-right corner to double Thailand’s lead and deflate Indian hopes.Substitute Lallianzuala Chhangte got a fine chance in the 80th minute but his left footer went just wide of the upright.The Changsuek, meanwhile, looked to exploit the spaces India left behind and could have added a third if not for a crucial intervention by Anwar Ali, who threw himself in front of a goal-bound shot in the dying moments.The match was part of preparation for India's crucial AFC Asian Cup qualifying round match against Hong Kong on June 10 in Kowloon.The same was also the case for Thailand as they face Turkmenistan in their AFC Asian Cup final round qualifier.",Benjamin Davis and Poramet Arjvilai scored for Thailand in the 8th and 59th minute respectively.

PANAJI: Naushad Moosa has returned as head coach of the India under-23 squad. This time, he has been handed a longer rope, stretching a year, and tasked with preparing the team for next year’s Asian Games and the AFC U-23 Asian Cup, qualifiers for which will be held in September.Last year, Moosa, assistant to Juan Pedro at NorthEast United, was in charge of the under-23 team for two friendlies against Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur.“The longer contract helps me understand the players better,” Moosa told TOI in a recent interview. “I spoke with the AIFF and told them it’s important to have longer camps as well, so that we can properly assess the players and opponents. I want to bring the best out of these players. Getting them to gel together, though, will be a challenge.”Moosa, a former international who played for India between 1994 and 1998 and won the SAFF Championship in 1997, has named a 29-member probable squad for the two friendlies in Dushanbe against Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic, later this month. A concern for Moosa is that a majority of players are with ISL clubs. Many of them are without enough playing time in the top tier of Indian football.“The younger under-19 players, all of them want to play for ISL clubs. My advice is don’t jump (straightway) into the ISL. Of course, you should try, but only a few make it to the top. The youngsters can sign for clubs where they get to play. At this age, it’s important for them to be playing competitive matches. Sitting on the bench for financially-rich clubs doesn't really help in their growth as players,” said Moosa.“The younger players in the ISL are not getting enough opportunities. There are a lot of promising players in the I-League who we will track,” added Moosa.From amongst the 29 probables, only a handful have featured regularly for their teams in the ISL. Just one among them, Vibin Mohanan, has a senior team appearance, though Ayush Chhetri, Abhishek Singh and Suhail Bhat, all aged below 23, are currently under Manolo Marquez with the national team.Mohammed Sanan, Nikhil Barla (both Jamshedpur), Korou Singh, Bikash Yumnam (both Kerala Blasters), Macarton Louis Nickson, Parthib Gogoi (both NorthEast United) and Dipendu Biswas (Mohun Bagan) are the more recognisable names among the under-23 probables.Only two players -- Rahul Raju (Gokulam Kerala) and Mohammad Arbaz (Real Kashmir) – are doing duty in the I-League, the second tier tournament.“We need to have more camps, more exposure matches. If we cannot travel abroad, we can play here, but with stronger opponents. Losing is not a problem. It’s important we play stronger opponents to prepare for the challenges. Our aim should not be to win SAFF. We must look at the bigger stage where we will be properly judged,” said Moosa.India U-23 will face Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic in two friendlies on June 18 and June 21 as part of the AIFF’s long-term plans to smoothen a pathway to the senior national team.The team is in Kolkata where they will train before setting off for Dushanbe on June 16.",India U-23 coach Naushad Moosa has been handed a long-term contract by the AIFF.

Jadon Sancho will leave Chelsea when his loan spell ends on June 30 after failing to agree on personal terms for a permanent transfer, despite having helped the club secure Champions League qualification with a fourth-place Premier League finish. The Englishman scoring in the UEFA Conference League final against Real Betis was not enough to hand him a permanent deal at Stamford Bridge.The 25-year-old winger joined Chelsea last summer from Manchester United on a temporary deal that included a £25million obligation to buy clause, subject to personal terms being agreed upon with the player.However, the club have opted against it and will now have to pay a fine of £5million to get out of the obligation. The Manchester United player, who still has a year left on his deal at Old Trafford is now exploring options both in England and across Europe for his next move.During his time at Chelsea, Sancho's numbers did not amount to anything significant, although he bagged five goals and ten assists in 42 appearances across all competitions.Speaking after the Conference League final, Maresca addressed Sancho's future, stating: ""From now on is when we sit down with the club and decide about next year.""The manager further praised Sancho's contribution, saying: ""Jadon Sancho, if we finished fourth, it's because of Jadon, if we won tonight it's because of Jadon. It's also because of Robert Sanchez — during the season, everyone is up and down a little bit, that's part of the game. ""While unable to strike a deal with the Blues, the 25-year-old is on the lookout for a new club, be it in the Premier League or elsewhere. While United prepares to negotiate with other clubs to offload the high-wage winger, who reportedly makes close to£300,000 a week, his current wage may prevent a permanent deal from materialising.

Paris Saint-Germain winning the UEFA Champions League for the first time in its history puts an end to one of the longest searches for European glory. Established in 1970, the French side were yet to taste European success prior to the final at the Allianz Arena on Saturday. Luis Enrique and his men made easy work of Simone Inzaghi's Inter as they steamrolled the Italians 5-0 in the final. While PSG's victory tops off an exhilarating Champions League season, it wasn't just the Parisiens that put an end to their trophy drought.The 2024/25 season will be remembered as the year many teams across Europe put an end to their quest for silverware. With PSG being the latest addition to the list, teams like Tottenham Hotspur, Crystal Palace, Newcastle United and Bayern Munich's Harry Kane have all added trophies to their cabinets. Here's a closer look at how this year proved to be pivotal in the quest for silverware for several teams.Led by Ange Postecoglou from the dugout, Tottenham Hotspur were in the quest for a trophy to put an end to their excruciating 17-year search for silverware. Spurs, often mocked for their inability to claim trophies, further stacked the odds against their favour, when Postecoglou claimed that he 'usually wins trophies in his second season'.With an emphatic win over Premier League rivals Manchester United in the final, Spurs finally put an end to their search for a trophy. Brennan Johnson scored the winner in a narrow 1-0 win.The Eagles clinched a trophy for the first time in 120 years after a major upset in the FA Cup final. After losing twice in the final of the same competition, in 1990 and 2016, Palace beat Manchester City in the 2025 final 1-0 thanks to a goal from Eberechi Eze. The result meant that City went trophyless for the first time since 2016 and Palace claimed their first-ever FA Cup.Newcastle United claimed a major domestic trophy for the first time since 1955 as they beat Premier League champions Liverpool 2-1 in the final. Goals from Dan Burn and Alexander Isak ensured that the side managed by Eddie Howe put an end to the 70-year wait. The title triumph was Newcastle's first since the 1955 FA Cup win.In the same year Tottenham Hotspur won the UEFA Europa League, former club captain and current Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane also ended his search for a maiden career trophy. Despite joining the Bavarians last season, the Englishman ended his debut season in Germany without any trophy to show for it.However, after a dominant Bundesliga campaign in which he topped the goal scoring charts with 26 strikes, Bayern claimed back the German league title from Bayer Leverkusen, who ended Bayern's streak of 11 successive Bundesliga titles last season.Ever since the French side was taken over by the sovereign-wealth fund of Qatar in 2011, PSG has kept it a priority to get their hands on the UCL trophy. However, despite heavy spending and bringing in top talent from across Europe, the Parisiens kept falling short of the ultimate prize.Lionel Messi, Neymar Jr. and even Kylian Mbappe failed to bring European glory to the club. However, Luis Enrique's side, led by Ousmane Dembele in attack finally clinched the biggest club competition with a 5-0 win over Inter.The Go Ahead Eagles are a club in the Netherlands that play in the Eredivisie. Despite gaining promotion to the top division in the 2020–21 season, the club were yet to win a trophy for over nine decades.However, the near century-long wait came to an end in April as they triumphed in the Dutch Cup over AZ Alkmaar 4-2 on penalties. The side staged a historic run to the final as they beat heavyweights PSV Eindhoven and FC Twente en route the final. The win put an end to a trophy drought that lasted a whopping 92 years.The Serie A side broke their trophy curse that lasted a little over half a century as they clinched the Coppa Italia over Italian giant AC Milan. Playing in red and blue, the side led by Lewis Ferguson claimed their first major cup since 1974.With the win, head coach Vincenzo Italiano and Dan Ndoye - the goal scorer in the final, have been immortalized in club history.After a 90-year window where league success did not come by, Royale Union St. Gilloise clinched the Belgian Pro League after beating the likes of Club Brugge and Racing Genk in the Champions Playoffs.After claiming 11 league titles between 1904 and 1935, the side had to wait until 2025 to add the 12th to their cabinet. Notably, Union SG was only promoted to the top division in 2021 after dropping down to it in 1972.The German side clinched their first trophy since the 2006/07 campaign with a 4-2 win over Arminia Bielefeld in the DFB Pokal final.Under the managerial control of Sebastian Hoeness, the Bundesliga side claimed their fourth DFB Pokal in club history, but first in over 26 years. Their trophy drought lasted a total of 18 years.",Paris Saint-Germain won the UEFA Champions League for the first time in its history. Luis Enrique's side beat Inter 5-0 in the final at the Allianz Arena. Tottenham Hotspur ended their 17-year search for a trophy with a Europa League win. Crystal Palace clinched their first FA Cup after beating Manchester City 1-0. Newcastle United won their first domestic trophy since the 1955 FA Cup. Bayern Munich's Harry Kane ended his career without a trophy.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121549620,imgsize-131784,width-400,resizemode-4/121549620.jpg"

Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) fans recoiled in shock with a stunned silence after Barcelona pulled off a historic comeback in the second leg of their Champions League 2016/17 Round of 16 match. The Spanish giants became the first team in the European tournament's history to overturn a 4-0 deficit, defying odds of 200/1.""We lost everything in the closing minutes,"" said PSG manager Unai Emery. While Neymar delivered a performance for the ages, it was Barca manager Luis Enrique who maintained belief despite a scenario where the vast majority hardly gave the Spanish side a 1 percent chance of qualification. ""If they can score four goals, we can score six. Infinite things can happen,"" maintained Enrique, setting the stage for an extraordinary 6-1 comeback win.While Emery soon made his way out, the 'chokers tag' became ingrained in the club's identity. PSG never really managed to overcome the horrors of that night at Camp Nou, surrendering the momentum yet again in the 2018-19 edition of the Champions League. The French club pulled off a 2-0 win against Manchester United at Old Trafford in the first leg of their quarter-final.However, PSG again failed to get the job done in the second leg, losing 1-3 and crashing out. Even the presence of Neymar, who was signed from Barcelona for a record sum, as well as Kylian Mbappe, proved insufficient.While PSG's fortunes in the Champions League did improve over the years, reaching the tournament's final in the 2019-20 edition, inability to hold on under pressure stood out like a sore thumb. Mbappe and Neymar failed to convert chances as Bayern Munich pulled off a clinical win. While PSG owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi had made the club's desire to win the Champions League amply clear, fortune simply failed to swing in their favour despite the addition of Lionel Messi.PSG's tendency to commit harakiri remained constant in the 2021/22 edition, especially during their Round of 16 match against Real Madrid. The French club leaked three goals in 17 minutes, crashing out of the competition following a 2-3 loss on aggregate.As the managerial merry-go-round continued, Khelaifi took a drastic and controversial decision by appointing Enrique as the manager at the start of the 2023/24 season. The move was certainly unpopular among the PSG fans, considering the Spaniard's 'persona non grata' status after the pain he had subjected them to. Well, who can begrudge unwillingness to face your worst nightmare on a daily basis?Enrique stamped his philosophy from the first day itself, terming the situation at PSG ""chaotic"" and shocking. While managers had previously been quite cautious while dealing with Mbappe, the Spaniard openly highlighted his lack of desire to defend. ""A little bit more normalcy does no harm,” said Enrique.There was complete focus on work rate, with players dropped irrespective of their profile in case of any drop in standards. While players and agents earlier attempted to manipulate the manager through external pressure, none of that worked in this case, as Enrique strongly went about his philosophy. Young talents like Willian Pacho, Desire Doue, Bradley Barcola, and Vitinha made their way in as PSG shifted their focus from the biggest names to building a strong core.The Spaniard won over fans by giving Barcelona a taste of their own medicine in the 2023/24 quarter-finals. PSG overturned a 2-3 deficit by recording a comprehensive 4-1 win in the second leg, as the Parisians pulled off their own 'La Remontada'. However, there was more work in store for Enrique as he soon realised following a 2-0 loss on aggregate against Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals. PSG hit the woodwork six times but failed to score a single goal.There was further an unexpected blow in store for Enrique as Mbappe forced a move to Real Madrid, depriving the Parisians of their top goal-scorer. While other managers would've been perturbed, the former Barcelona manager remained nonplussed. ""Our game does not consist in letting Mbappé do what he wants. That was the old philosophy which never won a major trophy. We are better in attack without him,"" he said.While such strong words could have made him a laughing stock, Enrique went about rebuilding with gusto, building a strong setup around attackers Ousmane Dembele, Goncalo Ramos and Doué. Dembele found his feet after being sidelined at Barcelona, scoring 33 goals in 45 matches this season. While PSG reached the Champions League 2024/25 final against Inter Milan, who'd been beaten only once the entire season, naysayers predicted them to perish yet again.However, Enrique's side showcased a strong display of intent, recording the biggest win in a Champions League final with five goals. PSG finally managed to win the Champions League for the first time, pulling off a feat which had seemed jinxed at one stage. Doue chipped in with a brace while another young prospect Senny Mayulu scored the final goal, showcasing the wealth of talent in PSG's kitty. Enrique wept tears of joy, having gifted everlasting peace to the PSG fans after tormenting them for eight years.",Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) have struggled in the Champions League.

We will meet to hear what he has to say, I repeat, on our part, we are very proud and honoured to continue with him,"" he said.Inter suffered a devastating loss at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain in the final of the UEFA Champions League on Saturday at the Allianz Arena in Munich. The Parisiens put five past the Italian giants in a heavily one-sided final, as the Nerazzurri looked helpless against a relentless PSG onslaught.Following the result, Italian media reported that Inzaghi could depart as early as this month, ahead of the Club World Cup in the United States, scheduled from June 14 to July 13. However, Inter Milan president Giuseppe Marotta has confirmed the club wants to retain the manager despite Saturday's result, with discussions set to begin this week. Inzaghi's contract with the club expires next year in June.PSG claimed their first-ever Champions League title with the largest winning margin ever seen in a final. On the other hand, Inzaghi's Inter fell in the final once again, with the score line far worse than the 1-0 loss to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in Istanbul in 2023.""This defeat will not have an impact.

Pascal Wehrlein on winning in Shanghai

TAG Heuer Porsche gained big in Shanghai





TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein gained no points on Day 1 of the Shanghai E-Prix last weekend. However, the Formula E driver was able to turn the tables in a rainy race the next day and claim second place on the podium. After the race, he confirmed that the result made him realise they were actually competitive on a wet track.Pascal Wehrlein secured second place in the Round 11 race in Shanghai, with his teammate Antonio Felix Da Costa joining him on the podium in third. The two had started in the same positions on the grid but in reverse order. It was, nevertheless, a double gain for Porsche on Sunday.Talking about the Round 11 race, Wehrlein said, “Very tricky conditions especially in the beginning, I think it got a little bit better towards the end, but our pace was good. Not good enough for P1, but quite far ahead of the guys behind. Personally I’m very happy about the result today because today was the first time that I felt like we were very competitive in the wet, which wasn’t the case in Tokyo and Monaco. I think we’ve found a good way there and in the end a happy ending for us. ”The two also scored double podiums at the Mexico E-Prix and then again in Miami, where Wehrlein won. He earned another podium at the Tokyo E-Prix.With such a strong performance this year, Wehrlein currently holds second place in the Formula E Driver Standings with 103 points.“It was a very strong result today in very tricky and challenging wet conditions,” Porsche Formula E boss Florian Modlinger stated after the double podium in Round 11. The 34 points earned from the results, plus the fastest lap by Wehrlein, also promoted Porsche to the top of the Teams’ World Championship—by a single point ahead of Nissan.“We are really happy with these points and regaining the lead in the Teams’ Championship by a single point. It will be a very hard fight to the end of the year. Overall – with three Porsche in the top six with Nico Mueller – we can be very happy,” Modlinger added.Also Read: Nick Cassidy on winning Round 11 race at Shanghai E-Prix: “It feels like we’ve been waiting a long time” Wehrlein and Da Costa will now be eyeing more such wins, with five more races remaining before the Formula E season wraps up for the year.

George Russell hinted at Dan Ticktum while commenting on Spanish Grand Prix incident

Dan Ticktum responds to George Russell’s remark





Cupra Kiro driver Dan Ticktum has reacted to Formula 1 driver George Russell’s “one British driver in Formula E” mention when the latter was asked if he had ever seen a driver who did what F1 champion Max Verstappen did, that is, deliberately hitting another during a race. Ticktum responded to Russell’s remark by thanking him for “free publicity” and likening himself to none other than Verstappen, who is currently the reigning number 1 champion in Formula 1.Red Bull driver Max Verstappen was handed a 10-second penalty during the race and a three-point penalty on his licence for hitting George Russell’s Mercedes during the Spanish Grand Prix. One more mistake and he can face a one-race ban. When Russell was asked if he had seen any other driver do such a thing, he told the media, ""Not in Formula 1. Maybe in Formula E. Maybe one British driver in Formula E.”Dan Ticktum took note of Russell’s mention. Ticktum had received a two-year ban for deliberately hitting another driver during an MSA Formula (now British F4) race. He recently clinched his first podium of the season at the Tokyo E-Prix.Taking to Instagram to share a recorded response to Russell’s remark, Ticktum said, ""I have just had a very nice evening with the team and some of the guys from Porsche here in Shanghai.I’m just on the way back to the hotel. It has come to my attention via the Twittersphere that a certain driver in Formula 1 - not to name names but his name is George Russell - has made some rather choice comments about a certain Formula E driver. ”Thanking Russell for the mention, he further said, ""He hasn't named my name, but it's quite obviously pointed at me. We'd like to address those comments that he made I believe on the team radio. Number one, thank you for the free publicity. We'll take that any day of the week. And two, while what Max did today was a little bit sceptical, to be likened to him at any point in my career is a positive if you ask me. Goodbye.""Also Read: “Everyone doubts me”: Dan Ticktum after claiming first-ever podium at Tokyo E-Prix 2025 Round 9 Max Verstappen later penned a note in which he accepted that the mistake was not right and it “shouldn’t have happened.” Meanwhile, Dan Ticktum is now preparing for the Jakarta E-Prix.

I was sitting at the back for a very long time; I was quite good on energy but I didn’t understand how the race was playing out. The team did a great job with the strategy because I came out of the pit lane in sixth so I thought, ‘now I can fight!’, but I need to look at the race after to understand a little bit better what’s actually happened. I was really struggling with energy on the last couple of laps so I did my best in the last few corners.

I felt like my balance wasn’t quite there and I really struggled with my rears, so it wasn’t enjoyable and it was very hard to keep the car on track.

Starting second and finishing third is not ideal – in the beginning I thought we had something, but then it was clear to me that I didn’t have the pace of the two cars in front, so it was all about bringing the podium home.”Antonio now stands third in the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings with 88 points.Taking to Instagram after the race, Antonio Felix Da Costa shared a picture of himself spraying champagne from the podium.

Coco Gauff brought a quick end to surprise French hero Lois Boisson's improbable run at Roland Garros on Thursday to set up a final against world number one Aryna Sabalenka. Gauff dominated from the outset on Court Philippe Chatrier and pulled away to a 6-1, 6-2 victory to extinguish the host nation's hopes of a first French Open winner since Mary Pierce in 2000.The 21-year-old Gauff is through to her third Grand Slam singles final. She finished runner-up to Iga Swiatek at Roland Garros three years ago before beating Sabalenka to win the 2023 US Open.""Obviously there's still a lot of work to do, but for now I'll enjoy this one and then prepare for the final tomorrow,"" she said.For Boisson, 22, it marked a disappointing finish to a remarkable first Grand Slam appearance, a year after missing out because of a serious knee injury.The world number 361 had never played a top-50 opponent before this week.Boisson dumped out two in the top 10 in third-ranked Jessica Pegula and world number six Mirra Andreeva to set up her last-four clash with Gauff.But Gauff proved a hurdle too far for a player who only had one WTA tour-level win before the start of the tournament.Boisson's entrance on court drew huge roars from a crowd filling back up after watching Sabalenka knock out three-time reigning champion Swiatek in the first semi-final.Cheers greeted each of Boisson's returns during the warm-up, but it was Gauff who hit the ground running with a break of serve in the opening game.The American second seed followed a comfortable hold with another break to dampen home spirits as the rain began to pound heavily on the closed roof.Boisson passed up three break points in the fourth game before finally getting on the board after Gauff had raced into a 4-0 lead.Gauff wrapped up the set with little fuss though following another break, subduing a partisan crowd that helped spur Boisson past Andreeva in the quarter-finals.After an exchange of holds to begin the second set, Boisson couldn't capitalise on a break point in the third game as she fired a forehand low into the net.Gauff broke for a 3-1 cushion only to hand the advantage right back the next game.With Boisson struggling for the consistency of earlier rounds, Gauff soon seized control again with her fifth break of the match for a 4-2 edge.Boisson could not produce one last act of defying the odds as Gauff pocketed the final two games to seal a comfortable victory.","Coco Gauff beats Lois Boisson 6-1, 6-2 to reach French Open final. Gauff will play Aryna Sabalenka in the final at Roland Garros. The 21-year-old is through to her third Grand Slam singles final.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121655994,imgsize-43370,width-400,resizemode-4/121655994.jpg"

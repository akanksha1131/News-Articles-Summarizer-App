NEW DELHI: The opening Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) beginning at the Optus Stadium in Perth on Friday saw two players making their red-ball debut for India, as the duo of fast bowler Harshit Rana and seam-up allrounder Nitish Kumar Reddy received their debut caps ahead of the toss.Reddy received his his cap from Virat Kohli, while Ravichandran Ashwin presented it to Rana, for whom it is the first international match as well. Reddy made his India debut in a T20I against Bangladesh on October 6, and before the month added, the 21-year-old had punched his ticket to Australia for the BGT.Shortly after that, India's stand-in captain Jasprit Bumrah won the toss at the Optus Stadium and opted to bat first. India's regular captain Rohit Sharma is unavailable for the first Test as he recently became a father again and has stayed back to be with his wife.What augurs well for the 21-year-old Reddy is that he was in Australia early with the India 'A' side for the four-day matches against the Australian 'A' team and is well acclimatized to the conditions. However, he didn't do much of note in the two unofficial Tests.Reddy has so far played 23 first-class matches since making his Ranji Trophy debut in 2020. Besides scoring 779 runs in 39 innings, including a hundred and two fifties, he has taken 56 wickets.The 22-year-old Rana, a right-arm fast bowler from Delhi, made his Indian Premier League (IPL) debut before playing his first first-class match for Delhi, which was in December 2022.Rana was one of the key performers for Kolkata Knight Riders in their IPL triumph earlier this year. Rana took 19 wickets in the tournament.In 10-first-class matches so far, Rana has taken 43 wickets at an average of 24.00 with his best effort in an innings being 7 for 45. He is also a handy batter lower down the order, which shows in his 469 runs in 14 first-class innings, including a hundred and two fifties.Nathan McSweeney, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Steven Smith, Travis Head, Mitchell Marsh, Alex Carey (wk), Pat Cummins (c), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Josh HazlewoodYashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Devdutt Padikkal, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant (wk), Dhruv Jurel, Washington Sundar, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Harshit Rana, Jasprit Bumrah (c), Mohammed Siraj",India's stand-in captain Jasprit Bumrah won the toss at the Optus Stadium and opted to bat first.

India XI:

India won the toss and decided to bat in the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia on Friday (November 22) at Perth. Both teams announced debuts in their ranks with Nitish Kumar Reddy and Harshit Rana getting the nod for India and Nathan McSweeney for hosts Australia.India enter the first Test of the five-match series with four seamers and a spinner in the form of Washington Sundar. R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja have both been benched after mediocre returns during the home series against New Zealand. Sundar, an off-spinner, did an exceptional job there as he took 16 wickets in two Tests, including a 10-wicket haul in Pune.As expected, KL Rahul will open the innings for India alongside Yashasvi Jaiswal after Rohit Sharma decided to stay home following the birth of his son. Devdutt Padikkal, who was introduced into the squad as a result of Rohit's absence, will make an appearance at No. 3 with Shubman Gill injured with a fractured thumb. Karanataka's Padikkal impressed many with 88 runs against Australia A in Mackay.Over in the hosts' camp, McSweeney was expected to make his Test debut and was handed the Baggy Green by former cricketer and coach Darren Lehmann.""We are going to bat first, looks like a good wicket. Very confident with our preparation. We played a Test match here in 2018 so we know what to expect. The wicket gets quicker. Nitish makes his debut. We have 4 quicks and Washi (Sundar) is the lone spinner,"" said stand-in skipper Jasprit Bumrah at the toss.Australia captain Pat Cummins said, ""We were 50-50, either way we are pretty happy. Feel well placed, pretty fresh. Any format we (India-Australia) play seems fiercely fought. Nathan McSweeney makes our debut at the top of the order.""Usman Khawaja, Nathan McSweeney, Marnus Labuschagne, Steven Smith, Travis Head, Mitchell Marsh, Alex Carey(w), Pat Cummins(c), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Josh HazlewoodKL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Devdutt Padikkal, Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant(w), Dhruv Jurel, Nitish Reddy, Washington Sundar, Harshit Rana, Jasprit Bumrah(c), Mohammed Siraj",India won the toss and decided to bat in the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.

Don't look at captaincy as a post but responsibility: Jasprit Bumrah

Nasty, abusive, fiery. The adjectives you presume are usually not pleasant when you type the words 'fast' and 'bowler' next to each other. Some even label them as 'dumb', or people with short fuses. When it comes to the captaincy, the tribe is always ignored, and a batter is usually favoured to do the job as they are perceived to be calmer, more intelligent.A more logical explanation about why fast bowlers are usually not made captains is, they already have so much on their plate physically. Adding the responsibility of field placements, rotation of bowlers, choice of roller, addressing the media before or after a win or loss etc, becomes a needless distraction. Jasprit Bumrah and Pat Cummins , Test captains of India and Australia respectively, have bucked that trend. They do not abuse or sledge batters while bowling. They also give the impression of being deeply cerebral and they look forward to challenges of leadership.""I love responsibility, I wanted to do the tough job since I was a child,"" Bumrah, who also led India in a Test at Edgbaston against England when skipper Rohit Sharma tested positive for Covid-19, said while addressing the media. ""You always want to be in the thick of things, you want to be thrown against tough scenarios, and this is another one that adds a new challenge to me.""Cummins took over from Tim Paine following a sexting scandal in the 2021-2022 Ashes series and is more experienced, having led Australia in 28 Tests.Reminded that it is only the third instance of two premier fast bowlers captaining their respective countries after Wasim Akram (Pakistan) and Courtney Walsh (West Indies) did it in 1997 and Cummins and Tim Southee (NZ) did it last summer, Cummins said, ""I don't think it really changes too much again, but it's one of those rare things. Looking forward to seeing, hopefully from the changeroom, how he (Bumrah) goes about his work out there. But as a fan of fast bowling, it's always good to see,"" he added and revealed that it took him about 10 Tests to find his footing in the dual role as pacer and captain.Bumrah reciprocated Cummins' sentiment. ""I obviously have been a fan of bowlers and fast bowling, which is why I chose to be a bowler,"" Bumrah said. ""I feel that physically it's a lot more draining to bowl, but tactically bowlers are quite smart as well. There're many examples in the past, in Australia and India. We had Kapil Dev . Pat has done a phenomenal job, and he's got a lot of success for Australia. Hopefully, it's the start of a new tradition and many more players will follow that,"" he stated.Bumrah carried the torch more forthrightly for his tribe and said bowlers as captains can be successful because they are more precise with their planning. ""Bowlers do a lot more research and are more data driven than batters.""When quizzed about his lack of experience in the job though, Bumrah fired back, ""Nobody is born with experience. If that self-belief is there, that's what matters.""Having played under successful skippers like MS Dhoni (whiteball cricket), Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, Bumrah feels there is no need to have a set template or follow his predecessors.""You must find your own way and you can't blindly copy anyone. Virat and Rohit have been successful and have got results, but my way is not to follow a copybook plan. Even when I'm bowling, I go with my instincts and that's how I have always played my cricket,"" Bumrah stressed.Allaying fears about overbowling himself as he is leading an inexperienced attack, Bumrah stated, ""I look at it differently. I can manage myself the best when I am captain. I know when I am fresh and I know when I need to push myself, and I know when I must take extra responsibility.""Cummins, who has a more senior leadership group around him, felt, ""The question is always just are you bowling too much or not enough? It's gut feel. Speak to some other people out there and come up with a decision.""",Jasprit Bumrah and Pat Cummins are Test captains of India and Australia respectively. Cummins took over from Tim Paine following a sexting scandal in the 2021-2022 Ashes series.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli 's latest post has created a stir on social media, with users and fans speculating over its meaning and intent.The message left many pondering about the nature of his post, leading to a flurry of reactions and debates online. With over seven thousand reposts, it quickly became a hot topic of discussion.However, Kohli 's post directed towards his decade-long partnership with his apparel brand, reflecting on the challenges he overcame to make it a success. The star India batter expressed his excitement about continuing to grow his brand for another ten years.""Looking back, we've always been a bit different. We never fitted into any box they tried putting us in. Two misfits, who just clicked. We've changed over the years, but always done things our way. Some called us crazy; others didn't get it,"" Kohli wrote.""But honestly? We didn't care. We were busy figuring out who we are. Ten years of ups and downs, and even the pandemic couldn't shake us. If anything, it reminded us-being different is our strength. So here's to ten years of doing it our way-the Wrogn way. Here's to being Wrogn. And here's to the next ten! Wrogn, for the right kind of man,"" he added.Kohli, who has been struggling with form, will be back in action for the first Test against Australia starting Friday in Perth.With an average of just 22.72 in his six Test matches this year, his performance has been well below his career average of 47.83 and his impressive 54.08 average in Tests played in Australia.However, having scored some of his landmark centuries in Australia and leading India to a historic 2-1 series win here in 2018/19, Kohli is expected to rise to the occasion and deliver his best.","Virat Kohli's latest post has created a stir on social media, with users and fans speculating over its meaning and intent.

As the impasse over the Champions Trophy hosting and scheduling continues, former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali has claimed that the tournament's official broadcaster has said 'no' to the hybrid model or to have India and Pakistan in different pools.After the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) refused to send the Indian team to Pakistan -- the designated hosts of the tournament, the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) has taken a tough stance with strong objection to a hybrid model, which will allow India to play their matches at a neutral venue, while the rest of tournament is hosted in Pakistan.In fact, the PCB chairman, Mohsin Naqvi, has gone on record to say that the hybrid model is not acceptable to Pakistan.With huge amounts of financial gains from an International Cricket Council ( ICC ) tournament dependent on the India vs Pakistan game and both the nations sticking to their decisions, the announcement of the schedule is understandably on hold as a tournament without either of the teams will take the sheen off it.""What did I tell you about the Champions Trophy...Broadcaster isn't agreeing to (hybrid model or India and Pakistan in different pools) and it won't,"" said Basit in a video on his YouTube channel. ""If there is no India-Pakistan match in a tournament, then it would be like a tasteless dish.""The former middle-order batsman added that Pakistan has made the right moves, which has put the ICC in a fix, where they have to not only satisfy both the BCCI and the PCB, but also the broadcaster, who won't be ready to bear any financial losses in the event of no India-Pakistan match.""PCB has played its cards very well, well done!...If you want to go ahead with the hybrid model, do it. But India and Pakistan won't be in the same pool, and Pakistan will play all their matches at home,"" said Basit.""Mohsin Naqvi is quietly sitting now. He has played his cards correctly.""Basit added ""ICC pareshan hai (is worried)"" while the world is watching the four-way game being played in the apex body's corridors.""BCCI sends a message to the ICC, and it is relayed to the PCB. Then the PCB sends a message to the ICC, and it is forwarded to the BCCI. Then the broadcaster jumped in and asked 'what's happening, this is not agreeable to us'.""Both broadcaster and the ICC are having sleepless nights.""The Champions Trophy, which is scheduled for February 19 to March 9 next year in Pakistan, is making a return to the ICC calendar after seven years.",Former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali claims that the tournament's official broadcaster has said 'no' to the hybrid model or to have India and Pakistan in different pools.

The match will take place at Manuka Oval , Canberra, starting November 30.This warm-up game holds significance for both teams as they prepare for the second Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Adelaide. The Adelaide Test will also be a day-night affair, making this practice match crucial.Boland, already part of Australia’s Test squad, aims to maintain his match fitness and push for a spot in the playing XI for the Adelaide Test. Michael Neser’s hamstring injury further strengthens Boland’s chances. A strong performance in this match could solidify his position as the preferred choice for the pink-ball contest, should any of the frontline pacers face setbacks.The Prime Minister’s XI, with input from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, showcases a blend of promising youngsters and seasoned campaigners.

Don't look at captaincy as a post but responsibility: Jasprit Bumrah

Since 2014, serial global trophy winners Australia have laid their hands on two 50-over World Cups (2015, 2023), four Ashes (2017-2018, 2019, 2021-2022, 2023), one T20 World Cup (2021) and the mace that declared them the latest World Test Champions (2023).One piece of silverware, though, has proved curiously elusive — the Border Gavaskar Trophy. It’s the prize for winning the Test series between India and Australia, named after two legendary cricketers, Allan Border and Sunil Gavaskar, who were the second and first to cross the 10,000-run mark in Tests, respectively.Contested since 1996, Australia last touched it in 2014-2015, when they beat India 2-0 Down Under in the four-match series. The following four installments, all tightly contested, have been pocketed by India 2-1.Thanks to Rishabh Pant’s maverick genius at the Gabba in Jan 2021, TV stations and fans asked for more and what have you: A first five-Test series of the BGT. VVS Laxman’s heroics in Kolkata and the thrilling Test series of 2000-01 resulted in a three-Test series growing into a four-Test affair and it seems Pant’s pyrotechnics have had the same effect.Former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting, not known for hyperbole, equated the IndiaAustralia rivalry to the Ashes. Ditto for former Ashes-winning captain Michael Vaughan. It’s up to the visitors now though to justify this massive hype.With the bitter taste of a 0-3 home humbling against New Zealand still lingering, India, led by Jasprit Bumrah , will be up against it when they square off against Pat Cummins ’ Australia at the Optus Stadium in Perth on what is likely to be a fast and bouncy pitch for the first Test.The build up to the series has been far from ideal for the visitors. Regular skipper Rohit Sharma will be missing because he is on paternity leave. Mohammed Shami, probably India’s finest exponent of seam and swing, is injured. Their promising No. 3 bat Shubman Gill, who has the game to succeed on the pacy wickets of Australia and is extremely safe in the slips, is nursing a thumb injury. Virat Kohli, their batting heartbeat, is out of form.While India had contingency plans in place for Rohit’s absence, Gill’s injury is a setback as it has forced mass changes to the top six.KL Rahul, short of confidence and pathologically inconsistent, will be forced to open, as the team management isn’t confident about Abhimanyu Easwaran after the Bengal batter didn’t make the four innings he got to impress against Australia A in the two games. Patience as a commodity is in short supply when teams are losing.Karnataka left-hander Devdutt Padikkal, who was on the way back home after his exertions for India A, was asked to unpack and report to Perth and will probably take Gill’s place at the No. 3 spot. Wicketkeeperbatter Dhruv Jurel, who batted well for India A, scoring twin 50s at the MCG, is expected to bat at No. 6, a spot that would normally have gone to Sarfaraz Khan.There is talk of the visitors opting for the medium pace bowling allrounder Nitish Kumar Reddy to hold one end up and give a breather to pacers Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep.What that will also ensure is that the tail isn’t made up of four No. 11s. India are expected to go in with a 4-1 combination with offie R Ashwin likely to do the spin-bowling duties, keeping in mind the Aussie top seven, which features three left-handers. The hype in Australia has been unprecedented ever since it was announced in April 2022 that the BGT will be a five-Test series. Captain Cummins (269 wickets) spent most of his time answering questions on the India series even while playing the first two ODIs vs Pakistan.He forms one fourth of arguably the greatest bowling quartet Australia have ever produced with Mitchell Starc (358), Josh Hazlewood (273) and offspinner Nathan Lyon (530).All of them are adequately rested and have prepared well by playing the odd Sheffield Shield game to shake off red-ball rust.There are a few worries surrounding the dipping batting averages of Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne and Travis Head in the current WTC. But history suggests the sight of India has always sparked an uptick in their form and fortunes.Australia hold all the aces. Can cornered India do an encore of 2021?","The Border Gavaskar Trophy is the prize for winning the Test series between India and Australia.

Former Indian cricket team fielding coach, R Sridhar , believes that Jasprit Bumrah needs a bowling partner who provides control. Sridhar emphasised the importance of having a bowler who can maintain a tight economy rate, especially during crucial phases of the game.""I would be looking at a bowler who will give you control because there are going to be pockets in the game where you need to block and bowl at less that 2.5 runs an over."" said Sridhar, speaking on the TimesofIndia's daily evening show Beyond the Boundary programmeHe drew a parallel with the 2018-19 Border Gavaskar Trophy , highlighting Ishant Sharma 's significant contribution.Sridhar lauded Sharma's ability to bowl economically and control the flow of runs, which allowed Bumrah to attack from the other end.""If you see the first Border Gavaskar Trophy that we won in 2018-19, Ishant Sharma gave us tremendous control with the cherry. He came in and just ran in blocked one end. I wish he was there as a mentor on the tour, he should be part of the change room as a mentor and not just sitting as a mentor.""He emphasised the need for a bowler who can replicate Sharma's performance and provide stability to the bowling attack.""You need someone to do what Ishant Sharma did in 2018-19 tour when India won the trophy. Who has the skill set to block one end so that when Bumrah bowls fearlessly with aggressive field?""Sridhar firmly believes that Bumrah's role should be to take wickets, and he shouldn't be burdened with the responsibility of containing runs.“Bumrah should not be brought down to a position where he is going to come and bowl to keep the game tight, if Bumrah is doing that then Australia is winning the game.

India to wait on Shubman Gill until the morning of Perth Test: Morne Morkel

NEW DELHI: Devdutt Padikkal , the young Indian batter, might get a chance to play in the first Test match against Australia. Mayank Agarwal , his senior teammate from Karnataka, believes that if given the opportunity, Padikkal needs to be ready for the challenges ahead.Padikkal wasn't initially included in India's main 18-player squad for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy . However, after Shubman Gill injured his left hand, Padikkal was asked to stay back following the A team's unofficial Test matches in Australia.Also See: Live Cricket Score If Gill is unable to play, Padikkal might play in his second Test match, having debuted against England in March.Agarwal, who found himself in a similar situation during the 2018-19 tour when he was called up for the second Test in Melbourne, spoke about the Indian players' preparation.""They (Indian players) have had time to prepare. The good thing was (that) a lot of the guys went and played India A games,"" Agarawal, who was in a similar situation on the 2018-19 tour when he was called up for the second Test at Melbourne, told PTI on Thursday.He emphasized the importance of mindset, saying, ""They have had at least three weeks to prepare themselves for the conditions. But it then now boils down to the mindset - are you willing to get into the fight?""He believes Padikkal has the right attitude and skills to succeed.""Or are you willing to embrace that fight? If he can get into that mindset - which he has; he has got a lot of skill, a lot of flair (and he) works hard on his game.""The possibility of Padikkal playing in the first Test seemed even stronger when the BCCI's official social media accounts shared a video of him rejoining the national team.""It feels really surreal to be honest. The intensity of the practice sessions were quite high.

They are going to face challenges, definitely. It's a place where cricket is played really hard,"" said Agarwal, part of India's 2-1 win on the 2018-19 tour.He stressed the need for a strong and determined mindset.""You want to put yourself out there with a mindset of saying, 'I want to be in that tough situation, or, I want to be in a situation where the chips are down and I can find a way and win the situation and win the game for the team',"" he said.Agarwal also expressed his support for his longtime teammate KL Rahul, who is expected to open the batting in Rohit Sharma 's absence in the first Test.He praised Rahul's adaptability in the batting order.""The real question here is that whenever you are going to play for India, when you are going to represent your national team, there is going to be pressure. The situations have been (different), where he has been asked to open and he has been asked to play different roles,"" he said.Agarwal believes that Rahul's experience and temperament will help him succeed.""I give him credit that he is somebody who is adapted to playing everywhere. We have seen that he has done really well overseas. He is very calm and he is very collected. He just needs to go about doing his routines, going about playing the way he plays and just stay calm,"" he said.","Devdutt Padikkal could get a chance to play in the first Test match against Australia.

R Sridhar , the former fielding coach of the Indian cricket team , believes that India's pursuit of a series victory in Australia will be challenging but not insurmountable. He expressed optimism about the team's ability to overcome obstacles, citing their history of resilience.""It’s not going to be easy for India, but the hope is for a hat-trick. That said, it’s not as if we haven’t crossed hurdles and overcome challenges before. So hopefully, we’re looking for an encore.""Sridhar, speaking on the TimesofIndia's daily evening show Beyond the Boundary programme, highlighted Virat Kohli ’s meticulous approach to preparing for major Test series in countries like Australia, England, and South Africa. He emphasised Kohli’s commitment to arriving well in advance of the first Test, typically 10 to 12 days prior, to dedicate ample time to practice.""Generally, when Virat Kohli goes for a big series inSENA countries , he likes to go all in with his preparation before the first Test. He’ll arrive 10–12 days early and get a lot of sessions under his belt. Each session consists of 200–250 balls, with plenty of time in the middle, including match simulations and practice matches. He usually takes on the most difficult pitches available, asking bowlers to bowl on them. He’s willing to look ugly in practice so that as the tour progresses, it becomes easier.""Sridhar elaborated on Kohli’s rigorous training regimen, noting the substantial volume of balls he faces during practice sessions, which often simulate match scenarios. Kohli’s preference, according to Sridhar, is to practise on the most challenging pitches available, pushing himself to refine his technique and adapt to demanding conditions.According to Sridhar, Kohli is entering a new phase in his career but remains in peak physical condition. His fitness levels are well-suited to the demands of an intensive 10-day training camp.""Virat is entering a different phase of his career, but make no mistake—his fitness is at its prime. He is well-tuned to endure the rigours of a solid 10-day training camp. He’ll work on his technique, focusing on knowing where his back foot is and ensuring his initial movements are precise. He likes to stay square with the back foot, keep his hips aligned, and target those fourth and fifth-stump deliveries. As we all know, anything on the stumps, he accesses the leg side fabulously. So it’s those fifth-stump deliveries that will challenge him."" he added.""He’ll be practising very hard to get into a position where he knows exactly where his off-stump is because bowlers like Starc and co. won’t give him anything on his body. They’ll aim to make him feel for the ball outside the fifth or sixth stump early in his innings. I’m sure he’ll be working hard to counter that. By the time he lands in Australia, he will likely have already faced 1,000–1,500 balls in practice."" he concluded.","Former fielding coach of the Indian cricket team believes that India's pursuit of a series victory in Australia will be challenging but not insurmountable. Sridhar highlighted Virat Kohli’s meticulous approach to preparing for major Test series in countries like Australia, England, and South Africa.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115534370,imgsize-38008,width-400,resizemode-4/115534370.jpg"

How the Australian squad members fared during the Sheffield Shield ahead of Border Gavaskar Trophy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/how-the-australian-squad-members-fared-during-the-sheffield-shield-ahead-of-border-gavaskar-trophy/articleshow/115532336.cms,"Marnus Labuschagne and Travis Head (X Photo)

The much-awaited Border-Gavaskar Trophy is scheduled to begin on November 22 in Perth. India is gearing up to face Australia in what is expected to be an exciting start to the series. As the Border Gavaskar Trophy approaches, let's review the performances of Australian players in the recent Sheffield Shield matches.Travis Head 's recent performance in the Sheffield Shield seems to suggest he will continue to bat in the middle order for Australia, a position he has always held in red-ball cricket for South Australia. However, the explosive left-hander didn't have a great outing upon his return to first-class cricket, scoring 30 and 10 runs in the two innings. Interestingly, spin bowling proved to be his downfall on both occasions. He was dismissed by Tanveer Sangha in the first innings and then fell victim to a brilliant delivery by Nathan Lyon in the second innings.In the same match, Marnus Labuschagne continued his impressive run in red-ball cricket, scoring 77 and 35 not out against Western Australia. The right-hander was on course for a century in the first innings but was dismissed leg before wicket while attempting a sweep shot off the bowling of off-spinner Corey Rocchiccioli. Labuschagne's recent scores in first-class cricket are a testament to his form: 35-, 77, 19, 119, 93 & 64.Besides his batting exploits, Labuschagne also showcased his all-round abilities, captaining the side and picking up two wickets with his medium-pace bowling. His bowling figures in the match were 6.2-3-5-2. Mitchell Marsh had a forgettable start to the new season, having to walk in to bat after just three balls as Western Australia slumped to 0/2 after 0.2 overs. He was unable to rescue his team on the first day, departing for a paltry 13 runs. However, the powerful right-hander made amends in the second innings, scoring a well-crafted 94.Interestingly, Marsh did not bowl in either innings of the match. With Cameron Green sidelined due to injury, Marsh will likely have to shoulder a significant bowling workload against India. His bowling fitness will be crucial for Australia's chances in the series. Usman Khawaja 's performance resembled Labuschagne's, except that he capitalized in the second innings after a missed opportunity in the first. This match against Western Australia was Khawaja's first as an opener for Queensland since February 2022.Nathan Lyon lived up to his reputation as a world-class spinner, claiming eight wickets in the match against South Australia in Sydney. This was Lyon's first professional game since July. He dismissed the dangerous Alex Carey in the first innings and then bowled Travis Head with a brilliant delivery in the second. Lyon bowled a total of 63 overs in the match, highlighting his impressive workload capacity.",The Border-Gavaskar Trophy is scheduled to begin on November 22 in Perth.

Argentina to play two friendlies, says

sports minister; assures fans

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala, it appears, has its mind, and heart, firmly set to deliver Argentina - and Lionel Messi - to its people. Even if the budget of this exercise runs up to anything between Rs 30-40 crores.Kerala sports minister V Abdurahiman on Wednesday assured the state's football fans that the world champion football team, including their talismanic captain, will play two international friendlies but stopped short of making a formal announcement. The minister also mentioned that representatives of the Argentina Football Association (AFA) will visit Kerala within a couple of months to finalise La Albiceleste's trip to the state.""The world's No 1 football team Argentina is coming to Kerala. Lionel Messi too will be here,"" V Abdurahiman declared during a media interaction at the state secretariat on Wednesday.""There will be two matches.

Let's gear up to welcome the champions and celebrate our love for football!"" the CM posted on his official X handle.Argentina's opponents for the friendlies have not been finalised, but indications are that it will be a prominent Asian side.

NEW DELHI: Argentina superstar Lautaro Martinez etched his name in Argentine football history by scoring the solitary goal against Peru, equaling the legendary Diego Maradona 's tally of 32 goals for the national team.The 27-year-old striker is now just one goal shy of surpassing Maradona and securing the fifth spot in Argentina's all-time top scorers list, led by Lionel Messi with an impressive 112 goals.Martinez's second-half volley proved decisive as Argentina solidified their position at the top of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Peru on Wednesday.The striker acknowledged the team's exceptional year, emphasizing the need for continuous improvement and recognizing the challenges that come with being a prominent national side.""It was a spectacular year in terms of performance, goals, games played.

Will Messi Make It?

Challenges & Concerns

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: State sports minister V Abdurahiman on Wednesday assured football fans that Argentina ’s national team, including Lionel Messi , will play two friendlies in the state next year, but stopped short of making a formal announcement.Representatives of the Argentina Football Association (AFA) will visit the state within six weeks to finalise the trip, Abdurahiman said. ""It is not right on my part to make a formal announcement. That will be done by AFA,” he told a media interaction at the state secretariat.The rivals of La Albiceleste for the friendlies have not been finalised, but indications are that it will be a prominent Asian side. It is learnt that AFA officials have sought a list of opponents from the state govt, and the association will pick their rivals from the list.The dates of matches will also be finalised after the AFA team’s visit, but the state govt is learnt to be exploring the possibility of hosting them in Oct. The minister has sought the help of traders to mobilise funds for organising such a high-profile fixture.Messi, a global icon, enjoys a huge fan following in Kerala , where football has long held a special place in the people's hearts. However, it will be too premature to confirm his presence in the squad as the friendlies are still a long way off.Earlier in the year, Messi didn’t take the field for Inter Miami’s friendly in Hong Kong, which resulted in a severe backlash from local fans and organisers had to offer a 50% refund on tickets.The minister didn’t announce the venue of matches, but his reference to a 50,000-capacity stadium for hosting them is a hint at Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium in Kochi . The stadium regularly hosts Indian Super League matches with fans packed to the rafters, but FIFA and Asian Football Confederation officials have expressed various concerns, particularly on security issues.The government will have several issues to address, like the exit routes, toilet facilities and even structural stability.“We know there are problems at JNI. Though we cannot rectify all of them, we will surely work on security issues, including those about sufficient exits, and toilet facilities. The complaints about structural stability will also be looked into,"" an official said.FIFA officials, when they visited the stadium last time, had raised concerns over the presence of cooking gas cylinders and inflammable objects at restaurants in the complex. The govt is, however, hopeful of cooperation from trade organisations on the matter.The Greenfield Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram is the only alternative, but it is now maintained and operated by Kerala Cricket Association (KCA). However, the govt doesn't need to tick all the boxes for the international friendlies as against a FIFA-approved tournament.","Argentina Football Association (AFA) will visit the state within six weeks to finalise the trip.

Uttar Pradesh rode a brace from Mohammad Tauseef to defeat Jharkhand 2-1 in the day’s earlier match.Bengal came into the game with a scintillating form, blowing away Jharkhand (4-0) and UP (7-0) in their previous two matches and looked well-placed to top the group — a prerequisite for progressing to the next round. However, Sen was also aware of the challenge on hand given that Bihar could advance with a win by upstaging the hosts on a head-to-head count.Bengal started on the offensive but couldn’t breach Bihar’s well-planned defensive set-up. The hosts, however, came close to breaking the deadlock towards the end of the first half.As winger Amarnath Baskey entered the box from the left side, Bihar defender Arif Khan stopped him in his tracks with an illegal push, forcing Shyamson Singh Chongtham to point to the spot-kick.However, Robi Hansda — who scored six goals in the previous two games — saw his penalty-kick saved by Bihar goalkeeper Sunny Raj as the ball ricocheted off the crosspiece in the 40th minute.Bengal continued to dominate after the break and Manotos Maji, who came on as a second-half substitute, could have snatched the win at the death but he failed to find the target from close following a low cross from Baskey.Nine group winners will now join reigning champions Services, last year’s runners-up Goa and hosts Telangana in the final round where they will be further divided into two groups of six teams each. Four teams from each group will progress to the quarterfinals.","Bengal finish Group C with 7 points, three points ahead of Bihar while Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand return with a win each.

However, only the top team from each group will progress to the championship's final round.Despite being billed as group favourites, coach Biby Thomas , who previously coached the Indian U-16 women’s team, doesn’t want to look too far ahead. “As of now, our first target is to beat Railways. We will be taking one step at a time,” said Biby.The hosts’ defence seems to be their biggest strength, led by captain Sanju G and supported by experienced players Manoj M, Muhammed Aslam, and Adil Amal. The team’s midfield looks solid, featuring players like Arjun V, Christy Davis, and Mohammed Arshaf.Controlling the match’s pace and creating scoring opportunities will depend heavily on Kerala’s midfield performance.

Outsiders Slovakia reached the Billie Jean King Cup final as doubles pairing Tereza Mihalikova and Viktoria Hruncakova completed a stunning comeback victory in Malaga on Tuesday.Emma Raducanu had given Britain the lead by beating Hruncakova in the opening singles but Rebecca Sramkova hit back for the Slovaks by upsetting Katie Boulter in three sets.Mihalikova and Hruncakova then outclassed British pair Heather Watson and Olivia Nicholls 6-2 6-2 to send Slovakia into Wednesday's final against Italy.It is the first time Slovakia have reached the final of the women's team event since 2002 when they beat Spain and Matej Liptak's team have done it the hard way, defeating the United States, Australia and now Britain during a superb run in Malaga.Hruncakova, ranked 238th in the WTA singles rankings, said she had never given up hope despite losing 6-4 6-4 to former U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu in the opening rubber.""Emma played absolutely amazing, so I did not feel bad after the match, actually, and I was very hopeful that Rebecca could make a point for us and that we can play a deciding doubles,"" Hruncakova said on court as her team celebrated.""And that happened. It was the best doubles of our lives.""For Britain it felt like a massive opportunity missed to win the competition for the first time and reach the final for the first time since losing to the United States in 1981.After Raducanu fought off the hard-hitting Hruncakova to seal her third singles win on the spin, Britain's number one Boulter, who like Raducanu had not lost a set in the ties against Germany and Canada, seemed in control.The world number 24 cruised the first set 6-2 but Sramkova then found another level to seize command of the second.She led 4-1 and although Boulter clawed it back to 4-4, Sramkova kept her country in the hunt by taking it to a decider.Sramkova carried the momentum into the third set to lead 3-1 but again Boulter fought back, cheered on by a sizeable British contingent in the small arena, to make it 3-3.It was Sramkova who kept her nerve though and at 4-5 down, Boulter served a double fault to give her opponent match points and she then struck a ball tamely wide to end the contest.Mihalikova and Hruncakova then took apart a disappointing British doubles duo to book Slovakia's place in Wednesday's showdown when they will again be big underdogs.Italy will be led by world number four Jasmine Paolini who will also partner Sara Errani, with whom she won gold at the Paris Olympics, in the doubles.""We are underdogs again but our confidence is growing,"" Liptak, in charge since 2009, said.""It's a dream, I've been a captain for many years and this was my dream to play in the final.""",Slovakia reach the Billie Jean King Cup final as doubles pairing Tereza Mihalikova and Viktoria Hruncakova complete a stunning comeback victory.

In a sensational revelation ahead of the Australian Open , the 24-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic has revealed that he was served food that ""poisoned"" him during his short and difficult time in Melbourne in 2022, before his deportation from the country in the Covid vaccine row.""I had some health issues, and I realised that in that hotel in Melbourne, I was fed some food that poisoned me,"" Djokovic said in an interview to GQ magazine.He said traces of lead and mercury were found in his body after that.""I had some discoveries when I came back to Serbia (following deportation). I never told this to anybody publicly, but discovered that I had a really high level of heavy metal. I had lead, a very high level of lead and mercury.""The 37-year-old tennis legend's visa was revoked, and he was ultimately deported from Australia because he declined to receive the Covid vaccination.During his unsuccessful legal challenge to stay in the country, he was confined to an immigration detention facility.Djokovic was asked further in the interview if he believed the food was contaminated. ""That's the only way,"" he replied.GQ's queries from Australia's Department of Home Affairs didn't elicit any response ""for privacy reasons"".However, Djokovic said that he has no ill-feelings against the Australian people. In fact, he returned to Melbourne the following year and won the Australian Open.""A lot of Australian people that I met in Australia the last few years or elsewhere in the world, have come up to me, apologising to me for the treatment I received because they were embarrassed by their own government at that point,"" said Djokovic.""And I think the government's changed, and they reinstated my visa, and I was very grateful for that. I actually love being there, and I think my results are a testament to my sensation of playing tennis and just being in that country.""Never met the people that deported me from that country a few years ago. I don't have a desire to meet with them. If I do one day, that's fine as well. I'm happy to shake hands and move on,"" he said further.Djokovic aims to secure his 11th Australian Open title and set a new record with his 25th Grand Slam trophy.","Novak Djokovic reveals he was served food that ""poisoned"" him in Melbourne.

Poll Who Do You Think Is Better as a Wicketkeeper in the Champions Trophy? KL Rahul Rishabh Pant

NEW DELHI: When the national selectors and the Indian team management get together during the weekend to discuss the squad for the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy next month , one can expect tough debates over balancing the spin attack, finding the two wicketkeepers and keeping a close eye on the fitness of Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah TOI understands that the selectors will pick a team for the T20I home series against England separately before finalising the potential team for the subsequent ODI series against England and the Champions Trophy It may be safe to assume that there will be a very few changes in the T20 that played in South Africa in November.It is learnt that the players from the recently concluded Australia tour, who are certain to play in the Champions Trophy , will play directly in the three-match ODI series.The biggest challenge in front of the selectors is zeroing down on the wicketkeeping options followed by balancing the lower middle order with spinners who can bat well. KL Rahul had become the preferred wicketkeeper in ODIs during Rishabh Pant 's absence from international cricket. However, Rahul's fitness to keep wickets for longer periods became a cause of concern after the 2023 ODI World Cup.Rahul was sidelined from the game for a couple of months last year - his hamstring struggled to cope with the workload of wicketkeeping. Interestingly, Pant replaced him in the XI in the last ODI India played in Sri Lanka in August last year.Sources said Pant being a left-hander provides variety in the middle order. It will be interesting to see if the selectors go with Rahul if he doesn't keep wickets. Sources also said that Rahul may be rested to be in shape for Champions Trophy.That decision will influence the chances of Sanju Samson and Shreyas Iyer in the middle order. Samson hit a hundred in the last ODI he played for India in South Africa in December 2023.But that innings came at No. 3 when regular top order of Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill were rested for the series. It is understood that coach Gautam Gambhir is very fond of Samson and wants to use him in formats other than T20s.The selectors are very eager to get Yashashvi Jaiswal, who is yet to make his ODI debut, in the ODI team. So, it could come down to Samson or Jaiswal being picked as the reserve opener.Picking the spin attack for pitches in Dubai isn't going to be straightforward. The team management likes to have batting cushion down the order. This is where Ravindra Jadeja 's credentials will be assessed. Axar Patel has been the more consistent spin-bowling allrounder. Washington Sundar's consistency with his off-break is something Gambhir wants to invest more in.The clincher could be Kuldeep Yadav's fitness. It is learnt that he is recovering well from his left groin injury and started bowling at the National Cricket Academy. It will be interesting to see if the selectors are ready to take him directly to the Champions Trophy should he not be available for the ODI series at home.The selectors have also kept a close watch on Varun Chakravarthy's progress along with Ravi Bishnoi in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. If anything, Chakravarthy's mobility in the field for 50 overs and limited batting ability could hinder his chances.There's some concern over the fitness of pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami. While the BCCI has chosen against divulging the nature of Bumrah's injury, Shami has been playing in the Vijay Hazare Trophy after having reported frequent instances of swollen knees while bowling in domestic cricket upon his return from a heel injury that kept him away from international cricket since the last ODI World Cup.Arshdeep Singh seems the only certain pacer to travel to Dubai with Mukesh Kumar, Harshit Rana and Prasidh Krishna all jostling for places.","Rahul's wicketkeeping fitness in question with Pant and Samson in fray. eyes also on spin attack, fitness of Bumrah and Shami. ToI understands that the selectors will pick a team for the T20I home series against England separately.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117102155,imgsize-40576,width-400,resizemode-4/117102155.jpg"

She highlighted the team's balanced composition and the capabilities of the players included in the squad.""As a team, we do not have to think what is not there because we want to go out there and have the positive mindset that we have a really balanced squad.

Definitely the last series gives us a lot of confidence and different batters at different times got runs, and especially against the West Indies our bowling attack was at point.""So, hoping that we keep the form going.""The series against Ireland provides an opportunity for younger players to showcase their talent and contend for selection in the upcoming ODI World Cup, which India will host later this year. The absence of senior players like Harmanpreet and Renuka creates space for these younger players.""Renuka and Harman both have been really important members and they have played their part amazingly well.

It's a new team almost. Of course, we keep on playing against Australia.""Mandhana expressed satisfaction with the diverse range of opponents India has faced recently, facilitated by the ICC Championship system.""The ICC Championship system gives us a chance to play all the teams in the three-year cycle.

Jude Bellingham and Rodrygo did the scoring duties as Real Madrid secured am emphatic 3-0 win over Real Mallorca on Thursday to set up a mouth-watering 'Clasico' Spanish Super Cup final against archrivals Barcelona.With strong support from the crowd in Jeddah, Madrid opened scoring through Bellingham's precise finish after the first half, as Martin Valjent's own goal in stoppage time extended their lead, followed by Rodrygo's close-range finish to seal the scoreline.Real Madrid dominated the initial phase against the previous season's Copa del Rey finalists, with both Lucas Vazquez and Rodrygo nearly scoring in the first few minutes, and Kylian Mbappe seeking a penalty decision after contact with Dani Rodriguez.Under Jagoba Arrasate's guidance, Mallorca established themselves defensively and successfully limited the Spanish and European champions' attacking opportunities throughout the first half.Real Madrid faced a setback when Aurelien Tchouameni left the pitch early in the second half following a head collision with Cyle Larin, although he later confirmed he had not sustained any injury.Real Madrid found their breakthrough in the 63rd minute via Bellingham, following unsuccessful attempts by Rodrygo and Mbappe that were thwarted by both the woodwork and Mallorca's keeper Dominik Greif.The decisive moment came from a swift Madrid attack when Vinicius Junior's cross found Rodrygo, whose header struck the post, followed by Mbappe's shot being saved by the alert Greif.Bellingham demonstrated his clinical finishing ability by calmly guiding the loose ball past the defenders stationed on the goal-line, further extending his impressive scoring streak.Despite Vinicius and Mbappe having a subdued performance compared to their usual standards, their involvement in the first goal demonstrated the team's attacking prowess.Real Madrid's second strike was an own-goal gift from Valjent, who inadvertently directed the ball into his net whilst attempting to intercept a pass, leaving Mallorca with a mountain to climb.The match concluded with tensions flaring between both sides, particularly involving Mallorca defender Pablo Maffeo and Madrid's Raul Asencio, who engaged in a heated exchange.Rodrygo sealed the victory in the closing stages, ensuring Madrid's progression to face their rivals from last year's final.",Real Madrid beat Real Mallorca 3-0 in the Spanish Super Cup in Jeddah. Jude Bellingham and Rodrygo scored the goals for the Spanish champions.

NEW DELHI: In the 2015-16 football season, a storm of unexpected events swept across England, rocking the entire world. At its heart was a team that had barely secured the Premier League promotion just a season earlier. Leicester City, a squad set up with low-profile names like Jamie Vardy, Riyad Mahrez, N'Golo Kanté, and their stoic captain Wes Morgan, was the epicentre.Operating on a shoestring budget in a cash-rich league, the Claudio Ranieri-led side lost only thrice in a 38-match season before lifting their maiden Premier League title, the top division of English football. With Leicester's name forever etched in history, Ranieri became the architect of this fairy tale that many once deemed unthinkable.Fast-forward a year, and halfway across the globe in India, chatters of a similar miracle were being heard. Much like Leicester, Aizawl FC — a club crowned champions of the I-League 2nd Division just a year earlier — were considered merely bystanders in the title race in India's top division ahead of the 2016/17 season.Under the guidance of a baby-faced Khalid Jamil , however, they shattered all expectations, losing only three games en route to lifting their historic maiden I-League title.""Winning the league in 2017 with Aizawl was the most memorable moment. We were an underrated team back then, so achieving that was truly special,"" goalkeeper Albino Gomes , who played an integral part in Aizwal's success that season, told TimesofIndia.com during an exclusive interaction.For Albino, however, one specific moment stood out above all: the penalty save that defined Aizawl’s 1-1 draw against Bengaluru FC in a title race that saw Aizawl finishing top with 37 points and Mohun Bagan runners-up with 36.""I saved a penalty from Sunil Chhetri in that match. If he had scored that penalty, we would have lost crucial points, and that might have cost us the league title,"" recalled Albino, who was awarded the Hero of the Match accolade that day for his game-changing save in the 55th minute.Now plying his trade for Indian Super League (ISL) club Jamshedpur FC, Albino Gomes initially never envisioned himself as a goalkeeper.""I actually went for the striker position in the school team,"" Gomes admitted with a chuckle. ""I was desperate to make it onto the team, but there were so many senior players ahead of me that I didn’t stand a chance as a striker. Then I noticed something — no one had taken up the goalkeeping spot. My coach stepped in, noticing that I was quite tall for my age, and suggested I give it a try. It felt like my only way to get on the pitch, so I decided to go for it. That’s how I started goalkeeping for my school team.""Reflecting on those formative years, Gomes is quick to acknowledge the impact of his school’s physical education teacher, Milind Sir, and a coach named Jerome on his journey as a goalkeeper.""In our school team, we had this one summer camp where they brought in a special coach from Bombay,"" he recalled. ""His name was Jerome, and he was Goan, he taught me the basics of goalkeeping. He helped mould me into a goalkeeper.""The footballing culture in Goa is rich and vibrant. Yet, during the months of December and January, around the time of New Year, Goa comes across as a different place.Amid the hustle of tourists roaming around to embrace the courteous charm in the air, the deep roots of its historic association with football may not always come to mind.Yet, Goa remains a state that has played 14 times in the final of the prestigious Santosh Trophy and lifted the title five times, not a bad number — given that they are the smallest state in India by area, covering 3,702 square kilometres of the nation's land.There are hundreds and thousands of stories across social media, stories of heroes rising from the sand and mud fields of Goa, as it resembles a machine still capable of producing prodigies of high calibre.""So basically, like every Goan, I played football when I was young. We played on the streets, in the mud grounds, on the sand grounds — everywhere,"" Albino Gomes reflected on his early days. ""From there, I started liking football, playing with my friends. Then, I joined the school team, and from there, I gained more interest in playing football. That’s when I started taking it seriously,"" he said.It wasn’t long before his talent was recognised.""After my school team, I joined Salgaocar FC. They picked me while I was playing for my school team. I spent around five to six years at the Salgaocar Academy. Many coaches there helped me, promoted me to the senior team, and gave me confidence. Training with the senior team and their goalkeeping coach helped me gain a lot of experience.""Despite Albino describing his journey as ""amazing"", it sometimes defies normalcy that he never got to play an official match for Salgaocar.""I didn’t play an official match for a while, but I got my chance to debut directly in the ISL. That’s where my journey really took off,"" Albino told TimesofIndia.com.In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on goalkeepers not only stopping shots but also taking on the role of sweeper-keepers, playing from the back and distributing the ball with short passes.Opening up on the evolution of the sweeper-keeper culture in India, Albino opined, ""Many Spanish coaches have come to India, and they demand goalkeepers play with their feet and take on the role of a sweeper-keeper. This includes making decisions like passing the ball from one side to the other. If goalkeepers train and build confidence in this style during sessions, it can greatly benefit the team.""He continued to explain how the approach to training largely depends on the coach’s preferences: ""It all depends on the coach. Each coach has their own preferences. If they want a goalkeeper to play as a sweeper-keeper, they modify the training sessions accordingly. This helps the goalkeeper get comfortable with the team, know where the players are positioned, and improve passing accuracy. It’s all about what the coach demands and how the keeper adapts to it.""Interestingly, Gomes holds the record for saving the most number of penalties (4) in an ISL season. ""I focus entirely on the ball. Luck favours me too, I guess. My strength is waiting for the kicker to make their move before committing to a dive, whereas some keepers move before the ball is kicked,"" Gomes explained. ""My goalkeeping coach and the analysts send me videos, so I study every player who takes penalties to understand their tendencies.""Reflecting on his time with Kerala Blasters , the club he joined in 2020 and played for over two years, Albino Gomes spoke highly of the passionate fanbase, adding, ""I've been with Kerala Blaster. The fans there are amazing, and they still support me a lot. So I think that is a plus point.""""If you want to be a goalkeeper, you have to accept that mistakes will happen. If you make a mistake, you shouldn’t let it bring you down. Instead, you have to acknowledge it, work on improving, and come back the next day with the same mentality and confidence,"" Gomes, now an experienced campaigner, shared his mantra. ""I look for the mistakes I have made, talk to the coach, and try to correct them during the training sessions.""When asked about his future ambitions, Gomes expressed a strong desire to represent the national team, noting, ""I want to be in the national team because I've been there and I know how it feels. I have to get to the senior national team and I am working for that and hopefully, this season goes well. The coach will hopefully notice at the end of the season, let's see how it goes.""","Albino Gomes is a goalkeeper for Indian Super League (ISL) club Jamshedpur FC. He is from Goa, a state that has played 14 times in the final of the Santosh Trophy. Gomes won the I-League title with Aizawl FC in 2017. He was awarded Hero of the Match for his penalty save against Bengaluru FC.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117081223,imgsize-75896,width-400,resizemode-4/117081223.jpg"

He believes he has found that fit with West Ham United .""It was important to me that I waited for a job that felt right for me, and equally, that I was the right fit for the club I am joining. That is the feeling I have with West Ham United.""Potter's managerial journey began at Swedish club Östersund. He then experienced success with Swansea and Brighton before taking the helm at Chelsea.His first match in charge of West Ham will be an FA Cup third-round tie against Aston Villa on Friday.

These acquisitions included Max Kilman, Crysencio Summerville, and Niclas Füllkrug.Potter spoke positively about his interactions with the club's chairman and board, highlighting their shared vision and values.""My conversations with the chairman and the board have been very positive and constructive.

We are on the same wavelength in terms of what is needed in the short term and how we want to move the club forward in the medium to long term.""",Graham Potter has been appointed as West Ham's new manager.

The top six teams in the end qualify for the tournament.""I have a lot of faith in the team, in the players who are emerging, who are young,"" he said. ""We're not in a position where we would like to be. I think together we can achieve something very big.

Barcelona 's Dani Olmo and Pau Victor have received temporary permission to play for the club. This comes after the Spanish sports council ( CSD ) granted precautionary approval on Wednesday.The financially challenged club couldn't register the players before the deadline at the end of last year. Olmo and Victor had been given temporary licenses when they joined in the summer.The CSD's decision allows Olmo and Victor to be selected by Barcelona. This is a temporary measure until a final ruling is made in the club's case against La Liga and the Spanish football federation (RFEF). These organizations had prevented the club from renewing the players' registrations.“This measure, which is provisional until the appeal filed by the club and the aforementioned players is finally resolved, suspends (La Liga and RFEF's decision), and the cancellation of the sports licenses of the aforementioned players,”“It also maintains the validity of said licenses until this appeal is finally resolved.”Despite this development, Olmo and Victor were expected to miss Barcelona's Spanish Super Cup semi-final against Athletic Bilbao in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday.If Barcelona qualified for the final, the players would be eligible to play on Sunday. They would also be available for subsequent Barcelona matches until the CSD's final decision.The players missed Barcelona's Copa del Rey round of 32 victory against Barbastro on Saturday. Barcelona presented their case to the CSD on Tuesday.The players were initially registered short-term. Barcelona utilized a financial loophole following defender Andreas Christensen 's injury.Barcelona lost two court cases last week attempting to secure new licenses for the pair. Following these setbacks, the club sold VIP boxes at their new Spotify Camp Nou stadium, which is still under construction. The reported €100 million ($104 million) sale aimed to allow the club to comply with La Liga's financial fair play rules.Despite the deal being finalized and paperwork submitted, it occurred three days after the league's deadline.La Liga confirmed that Barcelona now meets the financial requirements. However, Olmo and Victor's licenses had expired. Regulations prevent players from ""obtaining another license at the same club to which they were already linked"" during a single season.Barcelona argues that the rule is outdated. The club contends that since they now have the necessary funds and the transfer window is open, they should be permitted to register the players.

Sharp Yamal

Young starlets Gavi and Lamine Yamal fired Barcelona , without Dani Olmo after his licence to play was revoked, into the Spanish Super Cup final with a 2-0 win against Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday.Spanish playmaker Olmo was cleared to play again on a temporary basis before the game but the decision came too late for him or Pau Victor, in the same position, to feature against Copa del Rey winners Athletic.Gavi put Barcelona ahead from close range after 17 minutes and teenage winger Yamal netted the second early after the break.Spanish and European champions Real Madrid face cup runners-up Mallorca on Thursday in the second semi-final in Saudi Arabia, where the competition has been held for the past few years.""Athletic are a very physical team that make you run a lot, we suffered above all towards the end, but we were able to play well and we're very happy,"" Yamal told Movistar.The winger said Olmo and Victor were pleased to be allowed to play once more.""In the end you're nervous when you can't play and when you get news like that, you're very happy,"" added Yamal.Barca coach Hansi Flick hailed the decision from Spain's national sports council regarding Olmo and Victor.""The whole club is very happy for this right decision,"" said Flick, hoping to win his first silverware at the helm of Barca.""We wanted to show we are a team and we win also for them.""Barcelona, who qualified as La Liga runners-up, started brightly and Raphinha volleyed over from a fine Jules Kounde cross and forced Unai Simon into a good save with a free-kick.It was no surprise when the Catalans broke the deadlock with Alejandro Balde cutting the ball back for Gavi, playing in Olmo's attacking midfield role, to turn home for his first goal since suffering a severe knee injury last season.The 20-year-old pointed at an imaginary watch in his celebration, a nod to Olmo who regularly produces the same gesture after scoring.At the other end Inaki Williams dallied on the ball too long as Athletic's best attacking move of the first half broke down.Yamal, returning after an ankle problem, should have added Barcelona's second after Raphinha's shot was saved but the 17-year-old miscued an attempted lob.Wojciech Szczesny, on his second start in goal for Barcelona, made a good save to keep Inaki Williams at bay before the break.Barcelona doubled their lead early in the second half when Gavi slipped in Yamal who finished with aplomb.Veteran Polish forward Robert Lewandowski spurned a fine chance to add the third, firing off-target when well placed.Athletic coach Ernesto Valverde, who was sacked as Barcelona boss after a defeat at the same stadium in 2020, brought on Nico Williams to try and turn the game around.The Spain international, heavily linked with Barcelona in the summer, was not fit enough to start, but made a positive impact from the bench.The winger set up Oscar de Marcos to strike but the Athletic defender had strayed just offside and the goal was ruled out.Inaki Williams also had a goal ruled out for offside after Frenkie De Jong's poor back-pass took a slight deflection off Alvaro Djalo on its way to the Ghana international.""It's a shame given all the effort... but we have good things ahead of us and we have to continue,"" said Inaki Williams.Barcelona were able to book their place in Sunday's final, in which Olmo will be allowed to feature.""We don't care (who we face in the final), it will be hard and we want to win it, which is the important thing, and go back home with the trophy,"" said Yamal.",Barcelona beat Athletic Bilbao 2-0 in the Spanish Super Cup semi-final.

NEW DELHI: Goran Ivanisevic was the first wildcard to win Wimbledon , beating Patrick Rafter in a manic Monday final. It was 2001, and son Emanuel hadn’t been born yet. It’s 2025, and the Croatian teen with a heavy surname finds himself slugging it out on the practice courts of DLTA , having bowed out of the singles and doubles events of the Delhi ITF Juniors-J300 earlier this week.It is the start of the season, and there are many more frequent flyer miles to clock. “The plan is that I leave for Chandigarh (Friday). And after that, I will go to Kolkata and then back home in Zagreb, Croatia,” he chalked out his immediate plan.But he would rather be somewhere else. “Yesterday, I found out that I would get into the Australian Open juniors , but I didn’t know, so I’m here. That was pretty unfortunate. But I will try to catch Paris or Wimbledon or the US Open.” The 17-year-old knows he will attract attention wherever he goes, but he brushes that devil called pressure lightly off his shoulders. “I won’t say I was bothered, at first it was weird. But I got used to it, so it’s okay now,” he said.It was a toss-up between football and tennis when he was a kid — his father had famously signed a short-term contract at his hometown club of Hajduk Split after the Wimbledon triumph — but the decision was easy. “Of course, it’s mainly because of him and what he has done for the sport that I started playing tennis at four years of age. I was alright in football, but better in tennis. So at the age of 10, chose tennis, and then started playing professionally.”There are perks of having a famous father. Emanuel’s favourite player is Novak Djokovic . “I look up to Novak a lot because he is the best tennis player of all time,” he summoned the superlative. With Goran coaching Djokovic for six years, splitting mid-2024, Emanuel had plenty of time to learn from the 24-time Grand Slam champion. “I was with him in Dubai for the preparation last year, and he gave me a lot of tips. He spoke to me a lot about meditation, focus, eating habits,” he said.And did he follow up on the subjects? His leftie dad has been known to smash a racquet or two. “I think my mind is my biggest asset,” he pointed out. Mentally, they may move in different directions, but Emanuel is game on smashing a few down the middle. “I try to play similar to my dad’s style. Very aggressive with a strong serve. Pity there is not a lot of junior tournaments on grass, but I hope in the future that I will get the chance to play.”His father has already refrained from coaching him, citing the possibility of getting into too many fights. But the young one knows dad is only a call away.",Goran Ivanisevic was the first wildcard to win Wimbledon in 2001. His son Emanuel started playing tennis at the age of four. The 17-year-old is currently playing in the Delhi ITF Juniors-J300.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117102293,imgsize-49652,width-400,resizemode-4/117102293.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Hady Habib has marked a significant milestone in tennis history by becoming the first Lebanese player in the Open era to qualify for a Grand Slam men's singles draw, achieving this feat at the Australian Open .His journey to the main draw was secured after winning three rounds in the qualifiers, with his final victory coming in a closely contested tiebreaker against Clement Chidekh of France, with scores of 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (8).This achievement is a continuation of Habib's ascending career trajectory, which saw him making his Olympic debut in Paris last year, where he faced the eventual silver medalist and four-time major winner, Carlos Alcaraz , in a memorable first-round match.In addition to his Olympic debut, Habib made history late last year in Temuco, Chile, by becoming the first player from Lebanon to win an ATP Challenger Tour event.Born in Houston, Texas, Habib moved to Lebanon as a child where he began playing tennis, later returning to the US to pursue a professional career. Now 26, he expresses a deep sense of pride in representing Lebanon on the global stage, viewing his efforts and sacrifices as reflective of the resilience of the Lebanese people.""I know it's just a sport, but I feel like representing Lebanon and sacrificing all the things I had to do to get here, it kind of resembles how our nation has fought back,"" Habib told Australia's SBS News recently.Habib's ascent in the world of tennis comes against the backdrop of a challenging period in Lebanon, marked by conflict and a fragile ceasefire following nearly 14 months of war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.The conflict, which saw Hezbollah firing rockets into Israel in response to an attack by Hamas, resulted in significant casualties and displacement within Lebanon.Throughout this period, Habib remained in contact with his family and friends in Lebanon, expressing heartbreak over the situation in his home country and a desire for peace.","Hady Habib has become the first Lebanese player in the Open era to qualify for a Grand Slam men's singles draw.

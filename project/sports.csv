Poll Do you think Babar Azam will bounce back in the next matches? Yes, he's a star! No, he's under too much pressure. It depends on the team performance.

An injury-hit South Africa, missing seven frontline players, stunned Pakistan with a commanding 55-run victory in the first Twenty20 international on Tuesday, silencing a packed home crowd that had turned up to celebrate Babar Azam ’s T20I comeback.Pakistan’s chase of 195 never gathered steam, folding for 139 in 18.1 overs, as Corbin Bosch (4-14) and George Linde (3-31) produced a masterclass in disciplined bowling. The Proteas’ spirited effort gave them a 1-0 lead in the three-match series, with the remaining games scheduled in Lahore on Friday and Saturday.The night belonged to Reeza Hendricks, who anchored the South African innings with a fluent 60 off 40 balls, laced with five fours and a six. Debutant Tony de Zorzi added fireworks with a brisk 33 off 16 balls, while Linde provided late momentum with 36 off 22 to lift the Proteas to 194/9 after a blazing powerplay start of 74 runs.For Pakistan, Mohammad Nawaz (3-26) briefly halted the run flow, but the hosts’ top order once again faltered under pressure. The spotlight was on Babar Azam, returning to T20Is after 10 months, but the star batter fell for a second-ball duck, offering a simple catch to Hendricks.The Rawalpindi crowd, ecstatic moments earlier, was left stunned into silence.Only Saim Ayub (37 off 28) and Nawaz (36 off 20) showed resistance, but Bosch’s pace and Linde’s guile ensured Pakistan never came close.Skipper Donovan Ferreira, captaining in place of the injured David Miller, praised his team’s composure. “It was a collective effort — Reeza held it together, George exploded, and Bosch was exceptional with energy and accuracy,” he said.Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha lamented yet another batting collapse. “We’re losing wickets too quickly and need partnerships,” he admitted.The defeat extends Pakistan’s struggles in the shortest format — and puts Babar under pressure to inspire a quick turnaround when the series shifts to Lahore.",Pakistan bowled out for 139 in 18.1 overs in Rawalpindi. South Africa take 1-0 lead in three-match series. Reeza Hendricks top scored for South Africa with 60. Babar Azam returned to T20Is for first time in 10 months.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124886733,imgsize-126072,width-400,resizemode-4/pakistan-vs-south-africa.jpg"
From Tearing to Talking: Multan Sultans' Ali Khan Tareen calls for truce with PCB after explosive showdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/from-tearing-to-talking-multan-sultans-ali-khan-tareen-calls-for-truce-with-pcb-after-explosive-showdown/articleshow/124886257.cms,"Multan Sultans owner Ali Khan Tareen (Screengrabs)

In a dramatic turn of events, Multan Sultans owner Ali Khan Tareen has extended an olive branch to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) just days after ripping up their legal notice on camera — a defiant act that sent shockwaves through Pakistan’s cricketing circles. On Tuesday, Tareen appeared to change tone, calling for a “fresh relationship” with the PCB built on “transparency, cooperation, and trust.”“Even though tearing the notice was quite satisfying, it’s time to move forward,” Tareen wrote on X. “In recognition of the PSL as a national asset, we’re putting grievances aside and aiming for a fresh relationship with the board. To that end, I’ve written to the PCB Chairman, proposing four key reforms to strengthen how the PSL is managed.”Tareen’s post was accompanied by a detailed letter addressed to PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, outlining proposals that include greater franchise involvement in decision-making, involvement of franchises in PSL hirings, creating professional management structure and regular update by the PSL to franchises.This conciliatory move follows a heated confrontation that dominated headlines earlier this month. The PCB had sent a legal notice to Multan Sultans, accusing Tareen of breaching clauses in their 10-year contract and demanding a public apology for his critical remarks about PSL management. The board even threatened to blacklist Tareen from owning any cricket franchise in the future — effectively disqualifying him from the re-bidding process when franchise rights expire in December.Multan Sultans, in an official statement, blasted the PCB’s action as “outrageous,” accusing the board of silencing honest feedback instead of encouraging accountability. “For the PCB to treat constructive criticism as a crime is petty and damaging to the PSL’s image,” the franchise said.Unfazed by the notice, Tareen had responded with a fiery video on social media — ending it by tearing up the document on camera. “If you were more competent, you’d know these matters aren’t handled this way,” he had declared, adding mockingly, “I hope you like my apology video.”Now, just days later, the 36-year-old entrepreneur appears to be pivoting from confrontation to collaboration.Whether the PCB responds positively remains to be seen, but one thing is clear — the high-voltage clash between Pakistan cricket’s most outspoken franchise owner and its governing body has sparked a broader debate about transparency and governance in the PSL’s next chapter.","Multan Sultans owner Ali Khan Tareen has extended an olive branch to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) The move follows a heated confrontation that dominated headlines earlier this month.

Navi Mumbai: Summoned out of the blue due to a freak injury that ruled Pratika Rawal out of the tournament, opener Shafali Verma, who has a knack for being explosive yet inconsistent, slogged it out during India’s training session under lights at the DY Patil Stadium on Tuesday with the rest of the Indian women's team, two days out from their 2025 Women’s ODI World Cup semifinal clash against Australia.Shafali was suddenly drafted into the side on Monday after opener Pratika Rawal was ruled out of the tournament following injuries to her knee and ankle, suffered during their last league match here at the DY Patil Stadium against Bangladesh.India will take on seven-time champions Australia, unbeaten so far in the World Cup, in the second semifinal here on Thursday.The 21-year-old Shafali made her ODI debut for India on June 27, 2021, against England in Bristol. Overall, she has played 29 ODIs, scoring 644 runs at an average of 23.00. She has amassed four fifties in ODIs and has a highest score of 71 not out. She is currently the top run-getter in the ongoing Senior Women’s T20 League, having made 341 runs at a strike rate of 182.35 for Haryana.Spending more than an hour in the nets, Shafali practised high catches with her teammates before padding up to bat alongside the Indian top order at the University Ground here.In what will be a big relief to the Indian women's cricket team's fans, keeper-batter Richa Ghosh, who missed the last league match against Bangladesh on Sunday due to a finger injury, kept wickets against net bowlers and also had a hit in the nets without any visible discomfort.Among the others who trained were Indian captain Harmanpreet Kaur , her deputy Smriti Mandhana , off-spinning allrounder Sneh Rana , and top-order batter Harleen Deol.","Pratika Rawal was ruled out of the tournament following injuries to her knee and ankle.

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: On Shreyas Iyer's injury, his own form and Australia series

Mumbai: Shardul Thakur may be down the pecking order in India’s scheme of things as they hunt for a seam-bowling all-rounder in the ODI team who can bat at No. 8, but the 34-year-old hasn’t given up hope of making a comeback.The right-arm medium-pacer, who can tonk the ball, threw his hat in the ring on Tuesday by stating that he is eyeing the spot which will be up for grabs during the 2027 ODI World Cup to be held in South Africa, where seamers will hold sway.Also Watch:“It’s important for me to keep performing and eventually return to the Indian team. Good performances will help me in selection. The ODI World Cup is also in South Africa, so there might be a place open for a bowling all-rounder at No. 8. I am eyeing that spot,” said Thakur after Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy game ended in a draw against Chhattisgarh at the MCA Ground, BKC.If we take a cue from how India lined up during the recent ODI series against Australia, Nitish Kumar Reddy and Harshit Rana are the two options for that place. But with the ODI World Cup more than one and a half years away, a lot can change till then.Thakur, though, is focused on the task at hand, stating: “I am ready to play international cricket.My preparation is such that if tomorrow I am asked to play international cricket, I am ready for that.”The Mumbai skipper last played an ODI for India during the 2023 World Cup at home but has since been overlooked in the white-ball format. He was part of the Test team on the recent England tour but was ignored for the home series against the West Indies, with India preferring Reddy.Coming to the Mumbai team, Thakur was looking forward to Yashasvi Jaiswal joining the team for their next match against Rajasthan, starting in Jaipur from November 1. Mumbai openers haven’t fared well in the opening two games, and the addition of the left-hander will be a boost as the team looks for a solid start.“He has never disappointed and has put up big scores. When he gets in there, when he is set, he makes sure that he scores a big hundred. That’s a big positive,” said Thakur.Thakur had a long chat with young off-spinner Himanshu Singh after the match and predicted that he will have a bright future.The 22-year-old finished with match figures of 4/108 in 45 overs and, more importantly, gave Mumbai early breakthroughs in both innings.Himanshu, who made his debut during the 2023-24 season, has been with the under-23 team for the last couple of seasons but is called into the senior team only when Tanush Kotian is not available. With Kotian selected in the India ‘A’ side for the two four-day games against South Africa, Himanshu, after his display against Chhattisgarh, is expected to get another couple of games.“I think he bowled very well. It’s not easy to play an under-23 game, then come into the Ranji Trophy and do well. He got us wickets early in the innings, which was crucial,” said Thakur.He also had words of encouragement for Shams Mulani (5/59), who took another five-for — his second of the season and 18th in first-class cricket — stating that he “will get his due soon”.“Everyone aims, and everyone’s goal, is to play for India. Eventually, I feel he will get his due one day because he has been performing for us year after year.”",Shardul Thakur says he is eyeing the spot which will be up for grabs during the 2027 ODI World Cup to be held in South Africa.

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: On Shreyas Iyer's injury, his own form and Australia series

Pratika Rawal to be out of action for four months

Much to the relief of millions of Indian cricket fans, Shreyas Iyer is on the road to recovery. In fact, on Tuesday, BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia toldthat the India batter Shreyas Iyer “recovered faster than what the doctor expected.” Iyer, who suffered a spleen injury while taking a catch during the third and final ODI against Australia at the SCG last week, is stable and out of the ICU.While diving forward to complete the catch on the run, he suffered an awkward fall that resulted in a ruptured spleen and necessitated immediate hospitalisation. “Shreyas is much, much, much better. His recovery has been much faster than what the doctor expected. I’m in regular touch with Dr Rizwan (Khan, Indian team doctor who stayed back with Iyer to assist with his treatment at the Sydney hospital). Normally, he should take six to eight weeks (to recover completely), but you can expect a surprise from him because he may recover much earlier,” Saikia told TOI.“The doctors are very satisfied with his progress. He has started his normal functioning (routine chores). His injury was very severe, but he has recovered and is out of danger, which is why he was shifted from the ICU to his room in the hospital yesterday,” the Board secretary added.Saikia said that Iyer didn’t undergo surgery but “a different procedure.” “Shreyas didn’t undergo a surgery but underwent a different procedure, which is why he recovered so early,” Saikia revealed.The “different procedure,” it is understood, was needed to immediately stop the internal bleeding. “The usual hospital stay for this injury is 7–10 days. So, Iyer is likely to be in the hospital for that long,” a source tracking developments told this paper.The BCCI is arranging for Shreyas’ sister, Shresta Iyer, to fly to Sydney to join and help him out there soon. “The BCCI has done its best to help Shreyas out. The BCCI’s doctor (Rizwan) is totally focused on Iyer’s treatment and recovery there. Shreyas has been put up in the best hospital in Sydney (St Vincent’s Hospital),” Saikia said.It is learnt that on Tuesday, Iyer was in fine shape, eating solid food, walking in the Sydney hospital without support, and taking phone calls. Providing an update on his condition, India’s T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav, speaking to reporters ahead of the first T20I against Australia, said, “We spoke to him at least on the first day when we got to know that he had an injury. I called him first. Then I found out that he did not have a phone. So I called the physio, Kamlesh. He told me that he is stable. On the first day, I don’t know how, but he was looking good.

He is talking. Everything is normal. He said that he will take care of himself for a few more days. But he has been replying, talking to everyone, so it is good,” the India T20 skipper, currently in Canberra, said.In Mumbai, Mumbai captain and India all-rounder Shardul Thakur also revealed to the media that he “spoke to Shreyas.” “He was stable,” said the pacer.Meanwhile, the BCCI secretary revealed that India women’s team opener Pratika Rawal, who picked up a knee injury while trying to save a boundary, will be “out of action for four to six months.”“Pratika will be out of action for four months. The women’s selection committee has named Shafali Verma as her replacement,” Saikia informed.The injury to Rawal came just three days before India’s crucial World Cup semifinal clash against Australia. The 25-year-old Delhi batter had scored a fine century against New Zealand and was India’s second-highest run-getter in the tournament, behind her senior opening partner Smriti Mandhana . She has been replaced by 21-year-old Shafali Verma.",Shreyas Iyer is stable and out of the ICU.

FIFA officially launched the second phase of ticket sales for the 2026 World Cup on Monday, putting another 1 million tickets up for grabs. This new phase marks the opening of a global ticket draw, which will run until 11 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday.A key feature of this round is the domestic exclusivity window for residents of the three host nations — the United States, Canada, and Mexico. During this period, local fans whose entries are selected in the draw will have the first chance to buy single-match tickets for games held in their respective countries.According to Heimo Schirgi, FIFA’s Chief Operating Officer for the tournament, interest in tickets has already been “massive” both globally and within the host nations. “This second phase, with its host country domestic exclusivity time slot, will allow us to say thank you to these local fans, while ensuring global opportunity as well,” Schirgi said.Fans from the three host nations can enter the draw until Friday. Winners will be randomly selected and granted a specific time slot between November 12 and 15 to make their ticket purchases. Notifications will be sent out at least 48 hours in advance.So far, residents of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico have led ticket purchases, followed by fans from England, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Argentina, and France. After the domestic phase ends, more slots will open globally from November 17, with further sales rounds to follow.Over 1 million tickets have already been sold, with fans from 212 countries purchasing seats. Twenty-eight of the 48 teams have qualified so far.Despite the buzz, logistical questions remain, especially around visa requirements for international visitors amid stricter U.S. immigration rules. Earlier this month, an Argentina friendly featuring Lionel Messi had to be shifted from Chicago to Fort Lauderdale due to slow ticket sales, which some linked to visa concerns.The 2026 World Cup, set across 16 venues in North America, will feature 104 matches and an estimated 7.1 million available seats. While FIFA hasn’t disclosed how many will be released to the public, base ticket prices started at $60 for select games, with premium seats — such as those for the U.S. opening match in Inglewood — priced between $560 and $2,735.In a first for the World Cup, FIFA will use, meaning ticket costs could rise or fall based on demand — a move that might push prices even higher on resale markets, where some listings have already crossed $60,000.","FIFA officially launched the second phase of ticket sales for the 2026 World Cup on Monday.

Kerala Sports Minister V Abdurahiman displayed aggressive behaviour towards media personnel during a school ground inauguration event in Erumapetty, Thrissur, on October 27, 2025. The minister knocked over channel microphones when reporters attempted to question him about allegations of suspicious dealings related to bringing the Argentina football team to Kerala.The confrontation came shortly after MP Hibi Eden held a press conference raising concerns about potential irregularities in the arrangements made for the Argentina football team’s proposed visit to the state. The allegations prompted media representatives to seek the minister’s clarification during the school event.When journalists approached Minister Abdurahiman with questions about the controversy, he reacted by physically knocking over the microphones placed before him. The situation quickly escalated, with the minister’s team reportedly pushing against some journalists during the commotion that followed.Former minister A. C. Moideen, who was present at the venue, stepped in to defuse the situation, urging media personnel not to “create a scene” as the minister entered the school premises.The incident has since drawn sharp attention to the broader controversy surrounding the proposed visit of the Argentina football team — reportedly featuring global icon Lionel Messi — to Kerala. Hibi Eden’s earlier remarks had specifically raised suspicions about possible irregularities in the arrangements made by the state government.The minister’s aggressive reaction to media queries has raised questions about the handling of press interactions by public officials in Kerala. The physical confrontation between the minister’s entourage and journalists has become a major talking point in political and media circles.The episode has also reignited concerns about press freedom and the right of journalists to question those in power. The alleged suspicious dealings linked to the Argentina team’s visit remain under scrutiny, ensuring that the controversy will continue to stay in the public eye in the coming days.","Kerala Sports Minister V Abdurahiman displayed aggressive behaviour towards media personnel during a school ground inauguration event in Erumapetty, Thrissur.

Lamine Yamal, returning from a groin injury, struggled to influence the game, sending a long-range effort well over the bar in the second half.Madrid maintained control in the closing stages, bringing on Rodrygo and Brahim Diaz, while Barcelona had few attacking options.Even a late effort from Ronald Araujo, pushed forward as a makeshift striker, failed to threaten Thibaut Courtois.Tensions boiled over in the final moments, with Pedri sent off for a second yellow card after a late foul on Aurelien Tchouameni.A brief sideline clash followed, with players from both sides involved after the final whistle.The win marks Madrid’s ninth victory in ten league games this season and highlighted their ability to perform in high-pressure matches, while Barcelona continue to manage squad limitations under Marcus Sorg, standing in for suspended coach Hansi Flick.",Real Madrid defeated Barcelona 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabéu on Sunday.

Arsenal stretched their Premier League lead to four points on Sunday thanks to Eberechi Eze’s decisive strike against his former club Crystal Palace, while Manchester City’s title hopes took a blow with a 1-0 loss at Aston Villa.Eze, who joined Arsenal in a £60 million ($80 million) move in August, netted his first Premier League goal for the Gunners with a stunning volley from Declan Rice’s free-kick six minutes before half-time. Palace failed to clear the delivery, allowing the England international to fire in the match-winner. The victory keeps Arsenal’s defence solid, marking their 10th clean sheet in 13 games across all competitions this season.Manager Mikel Arteta , however, will be concerned as Rice and William Saliba were both forced off in the second half due to injuries. Despite not hitting top gear going forward, Arsenal’s mix of defensive resilience and set-piece efficiency has proved enough to maintain their grip at the top. The Gunners now lead fourth-placed City by six points and have a seven-point cushion over sixth-placed Liverpool.Manchester City’s loss at Villa Park ended Erling Haaland’s 12-game Premier League scoring streak.Matty Cash’s spectacular strike from outside the box in the 19th minute secured a third consecutive season win for Aston Villa at home and pushed Unai Emery’s side into seventh place. Haaland had a late goal ruled out for offside, and with no other City player scoring in the league for over a month, Guardiola’s side was left frustrated.Elsewhere, Bournemouth climbed to second after beating Nottingham Forest 2-0. Marcus Tavernier opened the scoring directly from a corner, with Eli Junior Kroupi adding a second to continue his prolific run. Forest remain in the bottom three despite Sean Dyche’s managerial start in Europe.At the foot of the table, Wolves remain in the relegation zone after Burnley claimed a dramatic 3-2 win at Molineux.

MANCHESTER: The crisis is over for Manchester United . For now at least.For Liverpool, however, it is a very different story after a fourth straight loss in the Premier League on Saturday. A 3-2 defeat at Brentford delivered the latest blow to the defending champion's trembling title defense and left it sixth in the standings.United is heading in the opposite direction, a 4-2 win against Brighton moving Ruben Amorim's team up to the heady heights of the top four.Sunderland, though, is providing the unexpected narrative of the season after a stunning comeback 2-1 win at Chelsea saw it climb to second.Liverpool loses again The losses keep on coming for Liverpool.Not even a frantic fightback at the Gtech Community Stadium could prevent coach Arne Slot suffering a fourth straight defeat in the league, a result that leaves his team four points adrift of leader Arsenal, having played a game more.""This is a tough one to take. Unfortunately this was another not nice evening to have,"" said Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk. ""I am sure we will get out of it, but we won't get out of it by just talking about it.""Brentford led 2-0 after goals from Dango Ouattara and Kevin Schade. Milos Kerkez then got Liverpool back into the game in first-half stoppage time.Igor Thiago's penalty in the second half put Brentford back in control until Mohamed Salah lashed a brilliant shot into the top corner in the 89th.With 11 minutes of added time, the Merseyside club ramped up the pressure in search of an equalizer, but couldn't find a way through.It raises further questions about Liverpool's title defense, coming on the back of defeats against Crystal Palace, Chelsea and United. Not since 1984 has Liverpool successfully retained the title.In all, it was a fifth loss from the last six games in all competitions.Slot said it was the worst performance of all the losses in the league.""We didn't do the basics right, especially the first half, but during parts of the second half as well,"" he told TNT Sports.Amorim reaches winning benchmark at United A third straight win for United extended Amorim's best league run since he was appointed as coach last November, and provided a sense of momentum not felt for a long time at Old Trafford.""I think we are improving in the bad moments,"" he said. ""We can respond in a different way and we feel that we can solve anything. It's so hard and in football, everything can change in one week, so let's enjoy today and focus on the next one.""It was the first time United had won three league games in a row in the same season since February 2024.Victory also ended Brighton's winning streak in this fixture, which dated back three seasons.It is still too early to tell if Amorim has turned a corner after such a wretched start to his tenure, including the 20-time champion's worst-ever season in the Premier League last term.But coming on the heels of last week's morale-boosting win at Liverpool, the signs are positive, even if Brighton sparked a fightback to make it a nervy finish for the home fans.A prime source of encouragement for Amorim is the manner in which his summer signings have added a new dimension.Brazil forward Matheus Cunha scored his first goal for the club with a curling shot from outside the area to give United a 24th-minute lead.Another new signing, Bryan Mbeumo, also scored twice in the second half, making it three in his last two games, after Casemiro had doubled the lead with a deflected effort before the break.""The money was well invested,"" Brighton coach Fabian Hurzeler said.It was a former United player, Danny Welbeck, who gave Brighton hope with a brilliant free kick that flew into the top corner. When substitute Charalampos Kostoulas headed another goal in time added on, the tension rose inside the stadium.Then came Mbeumo's second to snuff out any chance of a collapse and ensure the winning streak continued.""This needs to be the normal for this club,"" said Cunha. ""I am so happy to be a part of this. Amazing day, I will remember this.""High-flying Sunderland Chemsdine Talbi scored Sunderland's stoppage-time winner at Stamford Bridge.Chelsea led after four minutes through Alejandro Garnacho, but Wilson Isidor leveled in the 22nd before Talbi's dramatic winner in the third minute of second-half added time.""We have a great team with great players,"" Talbi said. ""We knew we could do the job and we showed it today.""Sunderland was only promoted this season and moved to within two points of leader Arsenal, which plays Crystal Palace on Sunday.There was also a late winner at St James' Park, where Bruno Guimaraes scored in the 90th minute to seal Newcastle's 2-1 victory over Fulham.Jacob Murphy put Newcastle ahead in the 18th, but Sasa Lukic equalized in the 56th for Fulham.""We have to learn how to finish.

Sting to headline Super Bowl LX Studio 60 concert in San Francisco



A legendary performer returns to the Super Bowl stage



As the countdown to Super Bowl LX slowly begins, San Francisco is tuning up for a different kind of spectacle. Music legend Sting will bring his unmistakable voice and timeless hits to the Palace of Fine Arts on February 6, kicking off a star-studded weekend of celebrations leading up to football’s biggest night. Organized by the NFL ’s official hospitality partner On Location, the concert promises to merge world-class music with the electric atmosphere of Super Bowl weekend.Music icon Sting, a 17-time Grammy Award-winning artist, will take center stage at the “Super Bowl LX Studio 60,” an exclusive weekend of live music and entertainment celebrating the spirit of the big game. The Palace of Fine Arts, one of San Francisco’s most iconic venues, will host this grand event, blending the city’s artistic charm with football’s biggest weekend.Sting will perform alongside his longtime guitarist Dominic Miller and drummer Chris Maas, delivering some of his most celebrated hits from his vast career. “Witnessing a larger-than-life icon like Sting perform in an intimate venue such as The Palace of Fine Arts on Super Bowl weekend is a once-in-a-lifetime experience,” said Paul Caine, President of On Location. “The Super Bowl is more than just a game, and On Location delivers more than just a ticket.Through incredible hospitality and unique experiences, we bring fans closer than ever to the weekend-long celebration of sport, music, food, and culture that the Super Bowl has become globally recognized for.”Tickets for the concert start at $750, and the event promises not only music but also meet-and-greet opportunities with NFL legends and current players. Another Studio 60 event is scheduled for the following night, February 7, though the lineup for that evening remains under wraps.This marks a homecoming of sorts for Sting, who last graced the Super Bowl stage in 2003 alongside Shania Twain and No Doubt, performing the timeless Police hit “Message in a Bottle.” Now, over two decades later, he returns as a solo headliner during one of the most anticipated weekends in American entertainment.“We’re thrilled to partner with On Location and deliver a one-of-a-kind experience for fans that adds to the unmatched level of excitement and creative energy so synonymous with Super Bowl week,” said Peter O’Reilly, NFL executive vice president of events, international and club business. “Sting is a legendary artist with a timeless catalog, and we know fans will have an incredible time seeing his performance ahead of the biggest game of the year. ”The announcement of Sting’s show follows a wave of criticism surrounding this year’s Super Bowl halftime headliner, Bad Bunny. The NFL’s decision to feature the “DtMF” artist sparked backlash from conservative figures including Mike Johnson, Kristi Noem, and even President Donald Trump. Yet, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell defended the choice, saying he’s “confident it’s going to be a great show” and adding, “I’m not sure we’ve ever selected an artist where we didn’t have some blowback or criticism. ”With nearly 100 million albums sold across his solo career and his time with The Police, Sting’s presence at Super Bowl LX Studio 60 reinforces the event’s commitment to uniting sport and art in unforgettable fashion.Also Read: Jaxson Dart channels Superman spirit, spreading smiles and hope during emotional children’s hospital visit","Sting to headline Super Bowl LX Studio 60 concert in San Francisco on February 6.

White, a former second-round pick, brings size and versatility, aiming to reignite his career after a dip in performance. This low-cost move could prove a significant bargain for the 49ers as they push for the playoffs.

Keion White brings size, versatility and a fresh opportunity to revive his career

Patriots shift into edge rusher urgency mode as another Bill Belichick-era player exits

The San Francisco 49ers aren’t waiting around for help to magically arrive. With their defensive line boarded up like a house in hurricane season, the team has struck a deal to acquire defensive end Keion White from the New England Patriots. San Francisco will send a 2026 sixth-round pick and receive a 2026 seventh-round selection in return, according to multiple league sources.This move comes at a pivotal moment. The 49ers are 5-3 but have watched their defensive strength crumble under the weight of injuries. With Nick Bosa sidelined by a torn ACL since Week 3 and pass-rush specialist Bryce Huff battling a hamstring strain, the once-feared San Francisco pressure has suddenly gone silent.White, Keion White, a 26-year-old and former second-round pick, has the physical build of a defensive line dream: 6-foot-5, 285 pounds, and 34-inch arms. His combination of power and flexibility allows him to line up on the edge or at defensive tackle in passing situations. It’s no surprise the 49ers saw shades of their past successful moves, like adding Arden Key or Charles Omenihu.White flashed major potential in New England early. He burst onto the 2024 season with four sacks in his first two games, reminding Patriots fans of their glory days of relentless edge pressure.But inconsistency plagued him afterward as his snap count dipped and he fell out of the rotation entirely, culminating in a recent healthy scratch.A fresh start may be exactly what he needs. He has five sacks and 45 quarterback pressures as recently as last season, a reminder that the upside is real and untapped.For the Patriots, White’s departure adds pressure on a roster already thin at edge rusher. New head coach Mike Vrabel has now moved on from yet another Bill Belichick pick, and sources say New England is actively exploring replacements before the trade deadline. Players like Jaelan Phillips, Dre’Mont Jones, and Arden Key could be on their radar.Meanwhile, San Francisco gets a much-needed reinforcement, hoping White can help keep their playoff ambitions from wobbling. If he finds that explosiveness again, this low-cost deal could look like one of the smartest bargains of the NFL season.Also Read: Chiefs owners reportedly go all-out with romantic, ‘Lover’-themed engagement gift for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce","The San Francisco 49ers have acquired defensive end Keion White from the New England Patriots.

She’s also causing a playful stir with one small but unforgettable detail: her sky-high ponytail. For DCC rookies, making a splash is never guaranteed. But Ward has managed to do exactly that, all while embracing her own style, her favorite glam essentials and a dream partnership with Wingstop.While most cheerleaders on the squad sport iconic blown-out waves, Ward’s voluminous ponytail has become its own character under the stadium lights. But she admits it didn’t arrive without chatter.“There is a bit of controversy, of course,” Ward told Us Weekly. “Everyone’s like, ‘Why is there a ponytail?’” Instead of letting the noise shake her, she dug into DCC history. Styles have evolved with the times, and she proudly joins the ranks of other women who switched things up. “It’s not just me. I feel very honored to be up there with some other very inspiring women who have had different hairstyles over the years as well. ”Ward shared she got the ultimate green light from leadership during tryouts.“Kelli looked at me and said, ‘Oh, I think I prefer your hair up,’” Ward recalled, calling it a defining moment. “I got so excited. I was like, ‘Yes, this is like a moment for difference, a moment for me to express myself.’”Of course, beauty has a price. “We’ve finally nailed it with a million and one hair ties, bobby pins, hair spray [and] hair gel,” she joked. “I’m not gonna lie, at the end of a game day, you have a bit of a headache.”Ward’s signature look channels a little Ariana Grande energy. Think bold lashes, cheekbone shimmer and a fierce lip. “I love looking glowy, especially because my hair is up. I feel like I’ve got a serve face card,” she said. And after hours of dancing under bright lights? It’s Wingstop time.The fan-favorite cheerleader accidentally kickstarted a collaboration by casually filming her own review. “I was like, ‘This is a pinch me moment,’” she shared of the partnership. Her go-to flavors: Hot Honey Rub or Hickory Smoked Barbecue, “drowned in ranch,” of course.Whether she’s performing at AT&T Stadium or influencing hungry fans nationwide, Faith Ward isn’t just cheering for the Cowboys. She’s celebrating being authentically herself and inspiring others to do the same, ponytail and all.Also Read: Inside Brittany Mahomes’ evolving look: How lip fillers boosted her confidence and transformed her smile over the years","Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader Faith Ward has gained attention for her signature ponytail.

Social media claims the conservative group’s Super Bowl rival event is falling apart — but here’s what’s really happening

What’s actually confirmed so far

Why fans think it might be in trouble

The internet is buzzing again, this time with talk that Turning Point USA’s much-hyped “All American Halftime Show” might not actually happen. The conservative group’s alternative to the official Super Bowl performance was meant to rival Bad Bunny’s upcoming halftime show, but new online chatter claims the project’s in trouble. Some say it’s being scrapped due to low interest and a lack of star power. But here’s the truth: nothing’s been confirmed yet, and the rumors are running faster than the facts.The speculation first popped up on X (formerly Twitter) with posts claiming Turning Point USA couldn’t secure a big enough “right-wing star” to headline the show. A few viral tweets suggested organizers were quietly pulling the plug, but none came from verified or credible sources. No official statement, press release, or event filing from TPUSA mentions a cancellation or delay meaning, for now, this story lives purely in the land of online whispers.Still, the timing of these rumors makes sense. The group announced the event with big energy weeks ago then went silent. No headliner. No venue. No ticket details. That radio silence was enough to light up social media.Turning Point USA did officially announce the “All American Halftime Show” earlier this month. The plan? To host a family-friendly, patriotic halftime alternative during Super Bowl LX in February 2026, the same show that’ll see Bad Bunny performing on the NFL’s main stage. The event was pitched as a “faith, family, and freedom” moment celebrating American values, with TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk leading the charge.But after that flashy launch, updates dried up fast. As of now, there’s no confirmed location, performer lineup, or streaming partner. That lack of info is what’s fueling the rumor mill, not any confirmed cancellation notice.Many online believe the event’s facing trouble behind the scenes. Posts and memes joke that TPUSA can’t find a “big enough conservative celebrity” to fill the stage, while others point out that similar culture-driven projects by the group haven’t drawn mainstream attention. A few fans even joked, “They can’t even get Kid Rock to pick up the phone.”But others see the silence differently, suggesting the group might be saving announcements for a surprise drop closer to the Super Bowl season. Either way, the mystery has kept both fans and critics guessing.The “All American Halftime Show” was never just a concert, it was a culture statement. Turning Point USA launched it in response to Bad Bunny’s selection as the official NFL halftime performer, which some conservatives labeled “woke.” The group framed its event as the “real America” alternative, spotlighting patriotism and family values. Whether or not it happens, it’s clear that the show has already stirred up the kind of culture-war drama the internet feeds on.Until Turning Point USA makes an official announcement, the “cancellation” claims remain unverified. No press updates, no confirmation, just social media buzz and a lot of speculation.Also read - Justin Herbert goes viral for looking totally unimpressed during Justin Bieber and Madison Beer’s chat","Turning Point USA’s much-hyped “All American Halftime Show’ might not actually happen.

Numerous sources have confirmed the arrest, which opens a new chapter in the growing problem that has surrounded Terry Rozier since 2023 and now poses a threat to the NBA.

Additional Context for Tonight's New York Knicks vs Charlotte Hornets Match

as they face off against the Miami Heat on October 28, 2025. The latest injury report paints a clear picture of the Hornets’ current health, and while the team is battling several key absences, Ball’s return to full strength brings a significant boost to their lineup.After dealing with a mild knee contusion during the preseason, Ball has been officially cleared to play and continues to perform at an elite level. The Hornets’ star guard is averaging 28 points per game this season with strong shooting efficiency, showcasing his trademark creativity and leadership. He recently notched an impressive triple-double, underlining his value as the driving force behind Charlotte’s offense. Alongside key teammates Miles Bridges and Brandon Miller, Ball has been central to the Hornets’ early-season momentum.Unfortunately for Charlotte, the team will be without Brandon Miller tonight. The standout forward is sidelined due to a left shoulder subluxation (partial dislocation) and is expected to miss several weeks of action. His absence leaves a significant gap on both ends of the floor, as Miller had been a major contributor prior to his injury.In addition, Josh Green remains out after undergoing surgery on his left shoulder, and Grant Williams is still sidelined with a right knee issue, though he’s projected to return later this month. Guard Tre Mann is listed as questionable with a jaw contusion and will be a game-time decision.• LaMelo Ball: Cleared to play; expected to lead team offensively.• Brandon Miller: Out (left shoulder subluxation); expected to miss multiple weeks.• Josh Green: Out (left shoulder; surgery recovery).• Grant Williams: Out (right knee; targeting late October return).• Tre Mann: Questionable (jaw contusion).With several key players missing, LaMelo Ball’s leadership and all-around brilliance are more vital than ever. Averaging 28 points and over 7 assists per contest, Ball’s ability to control the tempo and create scoring chances will be central to Charlotte’s game plan. His vision and agility will be tested against Miami’s disciplined defensive schemes under head coach Erik Spoelstra. Historically, Ball has faced challenges against the Heat’s pressure defense, but his current form and offensive rhythm suggest he could rise to the occasion.The Hornets have shown resilience despite their injury troubles, with Miles Bridges stepping up as a reliable secondary scorer and defender. His presence helps maintain balance in the lineup as Charlotte adjusts without Miller and other sidelined players. The team’s offensive system remains dynamic, largely powered by Ball’s playmaking and Bridges’ versatility.On the other side, the Miami Heat also enter this matchup managing injuries of their own. There is some uncertainty surrounding Norman Powell’s availability, though even if he plays, the spotlight remains firmly on LaMelo Ball’s return.Tonight’s contest promises to be an exciting battle, with LaMelo Ball’s return ensuring that Charlotte’s offense will remain fast-paced and entertaining. Despite the Hornets’ injury concerns, Ball’s presence gives them a fighting chance against a tough Miami team looking to extend its home winning streak. Fans can expect a thrilling game where Charlotte’s star guard once again takes center stage, aiming to deliver another statement performance as the Hornets push to keep their early-season momentum alive.","LaMelo Ball has been officially cleared to play for the Charlotte Hornets against the New York Knicks on October 28, 2025.

What to Expect Tonight from the New York Knicks vs Milwaukee Bucks Match

is officially cleared to take the floor tonight against the New York Knicks, as the Milwaukee Bucks have confirmed his name is no longer on their latest injury report for October 28, 2025. The announcement ensures that fans will get to see the Greek superstar leading Milwaukee’s charge once again, continuing what has already been a historic start to his season.After weeks of uncertainty surrounding a lingering left toe injury, Giannis Antetokounmpo’s health has finally stabilized just in time for this marquee matchup. Earlier in the season, he was listed as questionable and even appeared on the team’s injury report ahead of Milwaukee’s last game against Cleveland. However, recent updates confirm that the two-time MVP has been fully cleared and is ready to play, much to the relief of Bucks fans eager to see his trademark dominance return.While the Bucks have reason to celebrate Giannis’s return to full strength, the team still has a few players on the medical radar heading into tonight’s contest.• Kyle Kuzma: Cleared to play after a left ankle sprain but remains a game-time decision depending on pregame evaluations.• Cole Anthony: Dealing with a non-COVID illness but is listed as probable and expected to suit up.• Kevin Porter Jr.: Sidelined with an ankle sprain and officially ruled out.With Giannis healthy again, Milwaukee’s overall injury outlook looks far better than it did earlier this month, giving them a major boost ahead of a challenging battle against New York.Giannis Antetokounmpo’s numbers this season have been nothing short of sensational. He’s averaging 36.0 points, 16.0 rebounds, and 7.0 assists per game - an elite statistical pace that has immediately put him in early MVP conversations. In his most recent outing, he nearly secured a 40-point triple-double and joined a rare group of only four NBA players ever to open a season with three consecutive games recording at least 30 points, 10 rebounds, and 5 assists.His scoring dominance inside the paint continues to set him apart. Averaging a league-leading 24.7 points in the paint per game, Giannis remains an unstoppable force near the rim. Facing one of the league’s most disciplined defensive frontcourts in the Knicks, he’ll once again be tested, but all signs point to him being up for the challenge.The Bucks enter tonight’s contest averaging over 120 points per game, thanks largely to Giannis’s unmatched efficiency and leadership. Sports analysts project Giannis Antetokounmpo to exceed 31.5 points in this matchup, highlighting how difficult it is for opposing defenses to contain him.The Knicks, however, have proven to be a tough opponent - having swept Milwaukee in their last regular-season series. Their defensive core has built a reputation for shutting down the paint and forcing teams to shoot from outside. Stopping Giannis will undoubtedly be at the top of their game plan, but the Bucks’ improved offensive rhythm could tilt the balance in Milwaukee’s favor.Whether it’s a trademark coast-to-coast drive, a ferocious dunk, or a perfectly timed assist, Giannis is expected to deliver fireworks in a matchup that has the potential to steal the NBA spotlight tonight.Also read: Is Stephen Curry playing tonight vs Los Angeles Clippers?

Jeff Teague’s bizarre comment puts Atlanta Hawks in awkward spotlight

What could possibly be the reason behind Jeff Teague’s racial remark?

While the Atlanta Hawks didn’t quite live up to the expectations of the fans this season, their performance didn’t quite reach there. Amidst everything, a former NBA star, Jeff Teague, who also played 7 seasons with the Atlanta Hawks, made a controversial comment that could literally spark a heated debate among the players of the league. While he clearly stated that his take on the statement was not based on racism, but on the fact that the Hawks are in dire need of players who could show anger in the game. Here is what the former NBA star had to say while being disappointed at the poor performance of his ex-team, the Atlanta Hawks.Jeff Teague is an NBA All-Star and has played almost 7 seasons with the Atlanta Hawks. The Hawks’ absolutely poor performance at the beginning of the season has created a sense of discontent in the minds of its former players, and one such prominent example is Jeff Teague. While talking to the Club 520 Podcast on Tuesday, Teague said, “We gotta get some dark skinned dudes”. That statement came out of spite, and Teague immediately understood that there might be consequences.To neutralize the situation, Jeff Teague added, “It’s not about being racist, we need somebody with some Grit, anger or something”. “I swear to god, we need Isaiah Stewart and we need one wing that just like a little more aggressive"" Teague said.""We got a lot of finesse players like Porzingis is a finesse player, Zach is a finesse player, Jalen Johnson is a finesse player”, Teague said. “We just don't got nobody who's kind of like a grit, grind me.

Although his intentions were never to hurt any player in the league, his comment might spice up the situation a little more than usual.He scored 15.9 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 7.0 assists while being with the Atlanta Hawks for the 2014-15 season.

The Chicago Bulls started the 2025-26 season on a great note. Their best player, Josh Giddey, however, made the news when his name emerged on the Bulls' official injury list. Despite this, he managed to play against the Atlanta Hawks last day. Now, what attracted everybody's attention was not his performance but how the commentator misspoke his name during the game.The Chicago Bulls ' impressive start was abruptly halted, and Josh Giddey faced an uncertain setback. Giddey, who signed a $100 million, four-year contract last offseason, is now a vital member of the squad. However, his present circumstances seem to cast doubt on his future.He nevertheless continued to play against the Hawks. The Bulls defeated the Hawks on Monday to secure their third consecutive victory of the 2025–26 season. With 15 lead changes, seven ties, and many memorable moments, the match between the two Eastern Conference clubs was intense.However, it was an announcer's error involving Giddey in the broadcast booth that truly attracted listeners' attention. When calling a play early in the final period, Adam Amin unintentionally said ""Diddy"" rather than ""Giddey."" Amin said:“(Dyson) Daniels tipped that to Diddy… Giddey.”This came while Giddey was struggling with his fourth MCP (metacarpophalangeal) sprain of his right finger. On the official NBA injury report for the Atlanta Hawks game, he was tagged as QUESTIONABLE. It's still ""unclear"" whether Giddey's absence during the final minutes of the match against the Orlando Magic was due to the injury.K.C. Johnson of Chicago Sports Network reported that Giddey missed the final four minutes and twenty-seven seconds of Saturday's game against the Magic . In Giddey's absence, Kevin Huerter would likely play more minutes for the Bulls.After leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder , he spent his second season with the Bulls. Giddey is now in his fifth NBA season after spending his first three years with Oklahoma City. Now, if Giddey's unwell, his absence would only put more pressure on White to lead the team.The Chicago Bulls and Josh Giddey have reached a $100 million, four-year contract. Giddey felt certain of his spot on the Chicago Bulls throughout the offseason. He intended to stay on the squad for a long time.About the same, Giddey said:""I never had any worries I wouldn't be here... This is where I wanted to be. They embraced me from Day 1. Teammates, front office, the fans — it felt like home really quickly.""He is a promising player. He had at least 20 points, 15 rebounds, and 10 assists in the previous season, and was the only NBA guard to have a few games with 25 points or more and 15 rebounds.Also read: Is Josh Giddey playing tonight?

Ja Morant gets real about being called the “Face of the NBA”

Ja Morant’s impressive scores over the years had left everyone in awe

While NBA legends like Stephen Curry, LeBron James, and Nikola Jokić are often referred to as the faces of the NBA, there are other players, such as Ja Morant, who fans think could become the next legitimate faces of the NBA. But, to what extent could this be true when it comes to reality? Does Morant really want to become the next face of the league, or is it just his fans who are hyping about absolutely nothing? While entering the 2019-20 NBA season, Ja Morant was blessed with the Rookie of the Year award, and since then, it has been a blast. But what if Morant doesn’t really want to head towards becoming the next legit face of the big league? This is what the Grizzlies star actually feels about becoming the public face of the NBA.With all the limelight coming onto the Memphis Grizzlies’ star about being the face of the NBA, this is the last thing on his mind at this point, as he was never after that title. While speaking with the Athletic’s Nick Friedell, Ja Morant said, “There’s a lot that comes with that… I play basketball for the love of the game, not to be the face of the NBA. Obviously, I hear that a lot. I don’t put no pressure on it”.“I just go out and just play my game. Me pretty much just going out there and doing that had me in those conversations.Obviously, people have their own opinions, but I really don’t care for it too much”, Morant continued. While already being the face of his team, Morant clearly does not pursue fame and simply wants to focus on his true self, which is playing basketball wholeheartedly.During his rookie season (2019–2020), Ja Morant scored 17.8 points per game, which ultimately led him to become the Rookie of the Year. Over the six seasons, Morant had an aggregate of over 6900 points. This season, the Grizzlies have scored an even 2-2, without the presence of their star players, Zach Edey and Brandon Clark. Thanks to Ja Morant. This season he scored 22 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 5.7 assists.While the rumor of Morant being the face of the big league will likely persist over the years, it is only a matter of time before he actually becomes one, voluntarily or involuntarily.Also read: Is Ja Morant playing tonight vs the Golden State Warriors?

Certainly not demonstratively angry and I muzzled her…I would’ve allowed her to be angry. I would have allowed her her full humanity.”Gabrielle Union continued, “I made her gracious, this decent kind leader, and I was still a villain in that movie for making her want accountability for the theft of their work product and the cultural appropriation…”The Being Mary Jane actress has always been very public about the struggles she has faced in the industry because of her ethnicity.However, despite the things that she has faced, Gabrielle Union has put it all behind and has always focused on her career.Today, Gabrielle Union is one of the most successful and popular actresses working in the industry as she also enjoys a peaceful life with Dwyane Wade.A few months ago, the high profile couple went public with Dwyane Wade’s cancer diagnosis and how it had affected their personal life.Fortunately, things worked out well for Dwyane Wade as he quickly recovered after undergoing a kidney surgery to remove the cancer.Also Read: ""Don’t believe everything"": Throwback to when Stephen Curry’s wife Ayesha Curry responded to an open marriage question about their relationship","The Being Mary Jane actress has always been very public about the struggles she has faced in the industry because of her ethnicity.

Draymond Green's bias for Western Conference

Golden State Warriors had a splendid start to the season

The NBA league features the Eastern and Western Conferences, and the dominance of one over the other is a significant aspect of the game. In the last decade, one has had a slight edge over the other, especially one particular team, and maybe that is why, veteran player Draymond Green recently commented on how the West has a much better chance to win the league than the East. Especially hinting at the Golden State Warriors, who have won the league 4 times in the last 10 years. But can they win it this season?In the last 10 years, 4 different teams from the East have won the league - the Boston Celtics, the Milwaukee Bucks, the Toronto Raptors, and the Cleveland Cavaliers. The West, on the other hand, came out on top 6 times. Add to that, the Golden State Warriors have won the title 4 times all by themselves, and the Denver Nuggets and Oklahoma City Thunder have won it once each. So, maybe statistically, Draymond Green is not too far off in claiming the West's dominance in the league compared to its opponent.“Quite honestly, I just don’t know that the East has any teams that can compete at a championship level with the teams at the top of the West. Obviously, Boston being down right now I think plays a huge role in that. The Cavs haven’t been able to show that. Darius Garland ain’t playing, so you know, obviously DG get back, you need to see how all of that comes back together, right?”Top teams from the Eastern Conference, like the Celtics, Cavaliers, or the Knicks, are currently replete with injuries, while the West is having a pretty good time - especially when you look at teams like the Warriors, Thunder, Nuggets, or the Los Angeles Lakers. But does that really mean the East is completely out of the equation?The Golden State Warriors started the 2025-26 NBA season with a bang.Right from the preseason, the team has shown a strong hand, having won 3 out of their 5 games, before the regular season began. Even then, they won their first two games against the Los Angeles Lakers and the Denver Nuggets, before losing a game to the Portland Trailblazers, coincidentally a team from the East.The team then went on to win their match against the Memphis Grizzlies and will be facing the Los Angeles Clippers at home next. They are the favorites to win the match, but in a ball game, you never really know what can happen. Draymond Green obviously had his faith in his team, not just for the game, but even for the season - but that's a long way to go, and fans can't wait to enjoy each and every moment of it.Also Read: NBA icon Draymond Green screams “Shut Up” after flagrant foul on Santi Aldama in Golden State Warriors’ win over Memphis Grizzlies","Golden State Warriors have won the NBA title 4 times in the last 10 years.

The two teams are entering this matchup with playoff-level energy, and Curry’s presence ensures fans will get the full spectacle of elite basketball.

His trademark precision shooting, exceptional off-ball movement, and ability to spark instant scoring runs have once again positioned the Warriors as a dangerous force in the Western Conference.Beyond his scoring, Curry’s impact extends to orchestrating the Warriors’ offensive rhythm. His presence draws heavy defensive attention, often freeing up teammates like Draymond Green, Jimmy Butler, and Jonathan Kuminga for quality shots.The chemistry within this veteran-heavy unit has been a major reason for Golden State’s strong start, with Curry serving as both their anchor and accelerator.Fans can expect his signature deep threes and highlight-reel sequences as he faces off against the Clippers’ powerhouse duo of Kawhi Leonard and James Harden - a matchup that promises intensity and flair on both ends of the floor.While Stephen Curry is set to play without restrictions, the Warriors are still managing a few injuries within their rotation. Forward Alex Toohey remains out due to a lingering knee issue that has sidelined him since preseason. Veteran big man Al Horford, who missed the previous game for injury management, is expected to return to the lineup tonight as coach Steve Kerr continues to carefully manage his minutes in back-to-back scenarios. Guard De’Anthony Melton is still sidelined with a knee injury and will not be available for selection.Despite these absences, the Warriors’ key contributors are active, allowing Kerr to field his preferred starting five with Curry at the helm.

With the Warriors’ confidence rising and their leader in top form, the team has a prime opportunity to rewrite that history tonight.Also read: Los Angeles Clippers vs Golden State Warriors regular season injury report: Who's playing, who's out, and more (October 28, 2025) Warriors fans can breathe a sigh of relief - Stephen Curry is fully cleared to play and ready to lead the charge against the Clippers.

The Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Clippers square off on October 28, 2025, in a regular-season clash that promises intensity, star power, and strategic drama. While fans can expect a high-energy contest between two of the Western Conference’s top contenders, both teams are dealing with significant injury setbacks that could reshape the dynamics on the floor.The Los Angeles Clippers enter the game short-handed, with three players unavailable for selection. Newly signed guard Bradley Beal continues to sit out due to persistent back soreness, missing his second straight contest. His ongoing absence has raised concerns about his long-term durability as the season unfolds. In Beal’s stead, the offensive burden will fall primarily on James Harden and Kawhi Leonard, who have already shown their ability to lead the charge in high-pressure situations.Rookie guard Kobe Sanders remains sidelined with a right knee sprain, while Jordan Miller is recovering from a left hamstring strain. Both players are expected to miss this matchup but could return later in the week if their rehabilitation progresses as planned.• Out: Bradley Beal (Back – soreness)• Out: Kobe Sanders (Right knee – sprain)• Out: Jordan Miller (Left hamstring – strain)The Golden State Warriors are also managing several injuries but will have their key stars ready to go.Forward Alex Toohey remains out with a knee injury after missing the previous game against the Memphis Grizzlies. His status for future contests depends on upcoming medical evaluations.Veteran center Al Horford, who joined the Golden State Warriors for his defensive presence and leadership, is dealing with a toe injury and is listed as day-to-day. The team is closely monitoring his status given the physical challenge presented by the Clippers’ frontcourt. Guard De’Anthony Melton continues his recovery from a knee injury and will be re-evaluated closer to the end of the week.• Out: Alex Toohey (Knee – injury)• Out: Al Horford (Toe – injury, day-to-day)• Out: De’Anthony Melton (Knee – injury)The Los Angeles Clippers will look to Bojan Bogdanović to play an expanded role alongside their superstars. In their most recent victory, Harden and Leonard combined for an impressive 50 points and 23 assists, setting the tone for their offense. Bogdanović’s scoring versatility, combined with the athleticism of Derrick Jones Jr. and the interior presence of Ivica Zubac, gives Los Angeles a strong mix of experience and adaptability. Kris Dunn will also play an important role on both ends, particularly in backcourt defense.For the Warriors, young talents Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody have taken full advantage of early-season opportunities. Their performances have helped balance the team during injury absences, earning praise from head coach Steve Kerr. The Golden State Warriors’ system will continue to revolve around Stephen Curry’s playmaking brilliance, with Brandin Podziemski and Jimmy Butler providing scoring support. Draymond Green remains the defensive anchor and emotional leader, guiding Golden State’s trademark switch-heavy defensive scheme.This meeting between the Los Angeles Clippers and Warriors is more than a typical regular-season game - it’s a test of each team’s depth and adaptability. Both rosters boast superstar talent but must rely on their role players to fill key gaps. For the Clippers, the big question is whether Harden and Leonard can maintain their All-Star-level production without Beal. For the Warriors, the focus will be on maintaining rhythm and energy while managing injuries to their rotation players.Fans can expect a thrilling showdown filled with strategic adjustments, intense rivalries, and high-level basketball on both ends of the court. The game tips off at 11:00 p.m. ET on ESPN, with San Francisco’s Chase Center serving as the stage for another chapter in this competitive Western Conference rivalry.Even with several key players unavailable, both teams possess enough firepower and tactical depth to make this an unpredictable, must-watch game.

World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz suffered a shock early exit at the Paris Masters on Tuesday, crashing out 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 to Britain’s Cameron Norrie after admitting he had “no feeling at all” for the ball during the match. The defeat not only extended Alcaraz’s barren run in Paris — where he has never won the title in five attempts — but also jeopardised his top ranking, with Jannik Sinner now poised to overtake him if he wins the tournament.Returning to competition after a three-week injury layoff, Alcaraz looked rusty and out of rhythm despite a promising start. “I had a lot of good practices here and felt great,” the 22-year-old said after the match. “But today, even in the first set that I won, I felt like I could do much more. I tried to be better in the second set, but it was the opposite. I just felt worse. I had no feeling at all.”Norrie, ranked 31st, capitalised on Alcaraz’s erratic form with a composed and clinical display. The Briton kept his nerve during crucial moments, breaking at 3-3 in the final set before sealing the biggest win of his season. “Such a special win to beat probably the most confident player in the world right now,” Norrie said.“I told myself before the match, even if I get into a winning scenario, I’m not going to be afraid to win. I stayed true to that.”Norrie’s dazzling shot-making drew gasps from the crowd at the La Défense Arena, with Alcaraz even pausing to applaud his opponent’s artistry at times. A perfectly placed lob and a breathtaking passing shot in the opening games summed up Norrie’s fearless approach.For Alcaraz, it was another night of frustration in Paris, reminiscent of his mid-match dips during this year’s Roland Garros before he managed to recover — except this time, there was no comeback. “I’m really disappointed about my level today,” he admitted. “It is what it is.”The loss leaves Alcaraz searching for answers ahead of the ATP Finals, while Norrie moves on to face the winner of the all-family affair between Valentin Vacherot and Arthur Rinderknech. The Briton’s upset has blown the Paris Masters wide open — and left the men’s No. 1 spot hanging by a thread.",Carlos Alcaraz beaten by Cameron Norrie in second round of Paris Masters.

What's it like being Arjun Tendulkar, Rohan Gavaskar - sons of legendary players?

NEW DELHI: Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar penned a heartfelt message to his son Arjun on Wednesday as the young all-rounder turned 26. The Master Blaster took to X to share his pride and affection, saying the family feels “lucky” to have Arjun in their lives.“We are lucky to have you as our son. To watch you grow into the amazing human being that you are has been a joy. We are so proud of you. Happy birthday, Arjun!! May God bless you always,” Tendulkar wrote.The birthday comes at a significant juncture in Arjun’s personal and professional journey. The left-arm pacer recently got engaged to Saaniya Chandok, granddaughter of industrialist Ravi Ghai, in a private family ceremony. On the field, Arjun marked his return to competitive cricket after a seven-month break in style.Earlier this week, he made headlines in the Dr K. Thimmappiah Memorial Tournament in Bengaluru by dismissing Samit Dravid, son of India legend Rahul Dravid. Arjun finished with impressive figures of 3/50 in 17 overs, reinforcing his reputation as a promising fast-bowling all-rounder.Arjun, who represents Goa in domestic cricket after starting his career with Mumbai, has steadily built his résumé across formats. He made his IPL debut with Mumbai Indians in 2023 and has already registered a first-class century and a five-wicket haul. His record—37 wickets and over 400 runs in 17 first-class matches—shows glimpses of an evolving cricketer still finding his rhythm.As Arjun celebrates his 26th milestone with blessings from his legendary father, fans are watching closely to see how he balances his rising cricket career with new personal beginnings.","Sachin Tendulkar writes heartfelt message to his son Arjun on his 26th birthday.

Inside details of India’s preparations for Bangladesh

Clinical with the ball, sloppy in the field

After the match vs Pakistan, India captain Suryakumar Yadav had called Abhishek Sharma ""selfless"" and pointed out one of his qualities -- that he also knows how to score runs after the powerplay. ""When he passes the powerplay, he can still bat the same way as he bats in the powerplay. But the way he analyses the situation post-powerplay, what is required of him, what bowlers are going to bowl, I think that's a plus point for him,"" Surya said. And all those traits were visible during his 37-ball 75 against Bangladesh on Wednesday at the Dubai International Stadium.Such was the impact of Abhishek's knock that after he got out, India managed only 56 runs in the next 53 deliveries to post 168/6 after a blazing start.Chasing a par total on a sluggish surface, Bangladesh folded for 127, handing India a comprehensive 41-run win. With the victory, India cemented their place in the final, and the match between Bangladesh and Pakistan to be played on Thursday would end up becoming a virtual semifinal.After being put into bat, India had a slow start. Abhishek was tentative at the beginning as he looked a bit twitchy and too eager to get going.He was dropped on 7 by Bangladesh stand-in captain Jaker Ali behind the wicket. A calming word from Shubman Gill, who was looking in sumptuous form, eased Abhishek.Abhishek teed off with a streaky four off left-arm spinner Nasum Ahmed's bowling and Shubman kept finding boundaries from the other end.Abhishek, after a scrappy start, started to look like a million bucks. Nasum gave him width to free his arms, and the stylish southpaw launched it over long-on. In no time, he found his touch and timing. Mustafizur was sent over long-on as well with a straight bat and the over ended another six. After a slow start — 17 runs in the first three overs — Shubman and Abhishek added 38 runs in the next two.Abhishek continued his march with four boundaries off Saifuddin's over as India ended the powerplay at 72 for 0.Leg-spinner Rishad Hossain's introduction brought some relief for Bangladesh. The lanky leggie got rid of Shubman Gill right after the field restrictions ended. Gill scored a breezy 19-ball 29. Shivam Dube, who was promoted to No. 3, true to India's flexible middle-order approach to take on the spinners, failed again as Rishad struck once more.Abhishek, however, looked unstoppable. He reached his fifty in just 24 balls and launched Rishad over deep mid-wicket for a six. He rotated the strike with captain Suryakumar Yadav and his fifth six brought India's 100 in just 10.1 overs.Abhishek looked all set to score the first century of the tournament before captain Suryakumar Yadav sold him out. Suryakumar played a cut shot towards backward point where Rishad Hossain stopped it with a dive. Abhishek was off for a single but was sent back by Surya after making an early call. Rishad fired down a flat throw at the bowler's end and Mustafizur whipped off the bails, and even a diving effort couldn't save India.All of a sudden, India looked in trouble. Suryakumar Yadav's scratchy knock of 5 (11) came to an end as Jaker Ali completed a good diving catch to his left. Tanzim Hasan, who bowled excellently up front, dismissed Tilak Varma, whose wild slog was caught by Saif Hassan.With five wickets down, it looked like India were losing the plot, but the experienced campaigner Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel steadied the ship. It was Hardik who did the heavy lifting with his crisp knock of 38, as Axar was not able to connect the ball. India finished 168 for 6.From 100 for 1 in 10.1 overs, the unnecessary tinkering with the batting cost India massively as they let at least 40 runs slip away in the middle. Interestingly, Sanju Samson, who was tipped as India's No. 5, didn’t even come out to bat as he was demoted to No. 8.Rishad Hossain (2/27) was the pick of the bowlers for Bangladesh, but surprisingly he didn’t finish his quota of overs.Although India dropped five catches — all of Saif Hassan’s — their bowlers produced a clinical display to dismantle Bangladesh’s batting line-up. Bangladesh’s troubles began early when Bumrah dismissed Tanzid Hasan for 1 in the second over. The left-hander closed the bat face too early, and the leading edge was safely pouched by Shivam Dube at mid-on.Kuldeep Yadav then struck with just his second delivery, sending Parvez Hossain Emon back for 21. Attempting another sweep, Parvez mistimed his shot and Abhishek Sharma held on to a comfortable catch at deep square leg.Axar Patel added to Bangladesh’s woes by dismissing Towhid Hridoy for 7. After hitting a six earlier in the over, Hridoy attempted another big shot but miscued it high towards long-on, where Abhishek Sharma completed the catch.Varun Chakaravarthy further tightened the screws. First, he bowled Shamim Hossain for a duck with a straight delivery that crashed into leg stump. Then, moments later, a sharp piece of fielding from Suryakumar Yadav sent Jaker Ali packing. Saif Hassan tapped the ball to cover and called for a quick single, but Suryakumar Yadav’s diving stop and underarm direct hit caught Jaker Ali (4) well short of his ground.Saif Hassan fought a lone battle but ran out of partners at the other end. He scored a feisty 69 off 51 balls and was the ninth man to get out. Only three other Bangladesh batters crossed double figures.For India, Kuldeep Yadav (3/18), Varun Chakaravarthy (2/29) and Jasprit Bumrah (2/18) shared the spoils.",India reach Asia Cup final with 41-run win over Bangladesh in Dubai. Abhishek Sharma's 37-ball 75 powered India to 168-6 after a slow start. Bangladesh folded for 127 chasing a par total on a sluggish surface.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124097963,imgsize-56644,width-400,resizemode-4/abhishek-sharmap2409-sd.jpg"

Inside details of India’s preparations for Bangladesh

It was a bittersweet evening for Sanju Samson in Dubai as India sealed their place in the Asia Cup 2025 final with a comprehensive 41-run win over Bangladesh on Wednesday.While the Men in Blue ticked most boxes, Samson endured a tough day at the office, not getting a chance to bat and then dropping a catch in the deep.The moment came in the 16th over of Bangladesh’s chase.Varun Chakaravarthy forced Saif Hassan into a miscued slog-sweep, only for Samson to put in a desperate dive at mid-wicket.He got his gloves to it, but the ball agonizingly slipped out. It was the second dropped chance in that over, summing up a frustrating evening for the wicketkeeper-batter.Watch:Fortunately for India, the miss proved inconsequential.Bangladesh folded for 127 in 19.3 overs, chasing 169. Jasprit Bumrah (2/18), Kuldeep Yadav (3/18), and Varun Chakaravarthy (2/29) spearheaded a clinical bowling display, with Axar Patel (1/37) and even part-timer Tilak Varma (1/1 in 0.3 overs) chipping in.Earlier, Suryakumar Yadav’s men posted 168/6 after opting to bat. Abhishek Sharma was the standout, blazing 75 off 37 with six fours and five sixes.Shubman Gill added 29, while Hardik Pandya chipped in with a brisk 38.Bangladesh’s bowlers, particularly Mustafizur Rahman (1/31) and Rishad Hossain (2/27), applied some brakes in the middle overs, but India’s top order had already laid the foundation.In reply, Bangladesh never looked settled. Only opener Saif Hassan (69 off 51) offered resistance, but with little support from the rest, the target was always out of reach.India’s victory means they storm into the Asia Cup final, keeping their unbeaten run intact.For Samson, however, it was a day to forget, but he will know there are bigger battles to come, with a trophy on the line.",India beat Bangladesh by 41 runs to reach the Asia Cup 2025 final.

Bangladesh's Mustafizur Rahman has achieved a remarkable milestone by becoming the fourth player to reach 150 T20I wickets. This feat came during the Asia Cup Super Fours match against India in Dubai on Wednesday.Rahman secured figures of 1/33 in his four-over spell and surpassed Shakib Al Hasan's record of 149 wickets to become Bangladesh's leading T20I wicket-taker. His career-best figures of 6/10 against the United States in 2024 stand as the best bowling performance by a pace bowler in T20Is.The 30-year-old bowler has joined New Zealand's Ish Sodhi as the joint third-highest wicket-taker in T20Is. They trail behind Tim Southee of New Zealand with 164 wickets and Afghanistan's Rashid Khan with 173 wickets. Rahman has taken 150 wickets in 118 matches, maintaining an average of 20.65 and an economy rate of 7.30.Rahman's 150th T20I wicket was Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav. The dismissal came through a short-length delivery down the leg side, which Yadav attempted to flick but edged to wicketkeeper Jaker Ali.India had a slow start after being sent to bat, scoring 17 runs in the first three overs. However, openers Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill recovered to post India's highest powerplay score of 72-0 in this Asia Cup.The momentum shifted after the powerplay when Rishad Hossain dismissed Gill for 29 runs off 19 balls. Sharma then reached his second fifty of the tournament with a single off Saif Hassan through mid-wicket.Sharma's innings ended at 75 runs from 37 balls when he was run out. He left his crease for a single, but Rishad's flat throw to Mustafizur at the bowler's end caught him short of the crease.

Chelsea survive

Alexander Isak scored his first Liverpool goal to inspire a 2-1 win against Southampton in the League Cup third round, while Chelsea survived a scare to beat third-tier Lincoln on Tuesday.Isak was making his third appearance for Liverpool since his British record £125 million ($169 million) move from Newcastle on transfer deadline day.The 26-year-old had drawn a blank in his 58-minute debut appearance against Atletico Madrid and also failed to net after coming off the bench for the last 23 minutes of Saturday's Merseyside derby win over Everton.But Isak got off the mark in the 43nd minute as Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy tried a short pass that was intercepted by Federico Chiesa, who picked out the Sweden striker to fire home.It was a belated birthday present for Isak, who turned 26 on Sunday.Isak, who had scored for Newcastle in their League Cup final win against Liverpool last season, was taken off at half-time as he builds up his fitness after missing pre-season training while his transfer was being negotiated.Shea Charles equalised for the Championship side in the 76th minute with a close-range finish after a wayward header from Liverpool's Wataru Endo.Arne Slot had made 11 changes from the Everton game but substitute Hugo Ekitike saved Liverpool's understudies from a penalty shoot-out when he finished off Chiesa's pass in the 85th minute.The French striker took off his shirt to celebrate and was dismissed for a second bookable offence.Liverpool have made a perfect start to the season, with seven successive wins, including five in the Premier League to take them to the top of the table and one in the Champions League against Atletico.""Not our best performance. You can expect that if you play a complete new team. So many players that haven't played for a long time,"" Slot said.""There were positives. Giorgi Mamardashvili had a good game in goal.

Barcelona's long-awaited return to their renovated Camp Nou has been pushed back after the city council rejected the club's request for an essential safety permit on Tuesday.The Spanish champions had hoped to host Real Sociedad this Sunday at their iconic home with a reduced capacity of 27,000 spectators. Instead, Hansi Flick's men will continue to play at the Olympic Stadium on Montjuic hill, their temporary base for the past two seasons during construction.“The club continues to work on obtaining the necessary administrative permits for the opening of Spotify Camp Nou in the coming weeks,” Barcelona said in a statement, adding that they are working on amendments requested by the council.The city's fire department highlighted issues with evacuation routes and other safety concerns. Deputy mayor Laia Bonet stressed that public safety was the council's top priority.“We share the club's desire to return as soon as possible, but this city council must guarantee the safety of everyone who wants to go to the stadium,” Bonet said. “We will not take a month or a minute longer than necessary to grant the license once all requirements are met.”Barcelona's operations director, Joan Sentelles, defended the stadium's progress: “Just because it's not finished, doesn't mean it's not safe,” he told reporters, noting that the roof will now be completed in summer 2027, a year later than scheduled.Initially set to reopen in November 2024, the Camp Nou project has faced repeated delays. The rebuild is estimated to cost €1.5 billion ($1.75 billion).For now, Barcelona's homecoming remains on hold, leaving fans eager for their return to Europe's largest football stadium waiting a little longer.","Barcelona's long-awaited return to their renovated Camp Nou has been pushed back.

Real Madrid extended their winning start to La Liga with a comfortable 4-1 triumph at Levante on Tuesday.

WATCH:

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan U-17 football team’s dramatic 2-3 loss to India in the SAFF U-17 Championship on Monday, in Colombo, not only highlighted the thrilling nature of the match but also drew attention for a controversial celebration that went viral on social media.The pulsating encounter at Racecourse International Stadium saw India top Group B, with goals from Dallulmuan Gangte (31’), Gunleiba Wangkheirakpam (63’), and Rahan Ahmed (73’) securing victory. Pakistan had responded through Muhammad Abdullah’s penalty (43’) and Hamza Yasir’s rebound strike (70’) to keep the contest on even keel.However, it was Muhammad Abdullah’s post-goal antics that caught the public eye. After leveling the match at 1-1, Abdullah ran to the corner flag, sat down, and mimicked sipping tea — a move interpreted by many as a provocative nod to the 2019 incident involving Indian Air Force Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was filmed drinking tea after being captured in Pakistan. The gesture sparked debate online, with opinions divided over whether it was playful or inflammatory.The controversy comes hot on the heels of Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf’s infamous “6-0” gesture during India’s six-wicket win in the Asia Cup Super Fours clash.Rauf, stationed near the boundary rope, used his fingers to indicate “0-6” in response to Indian fans, referencing unfounded claims about a past border incident. Videos of the action went viral, with Rauf facing widespread criticism from Indian fans for the provocative display.On the field, the match itself was tightly contested. India struck first through Gangte, only for Abdullah’s penalty to level the score. The second half saw India regain the lead via Wangkheirakpam, before Yasir equalized with a rebound. Ultimately, Rahan Ahmed’s winner in the 73rd minute sealed a tense victory for India, showcasing composure under pressure and clinical finishing.The game featured a mix of tactical battles and high-intensity moments, with goalkeepers Manashjyoti Baruah and Saamar Razzak making key saves. India’s precise passing and coordinated attacks exploited gaps in Pakistan’s defence, while Pakistan’s physicality and pressing strategy kept the contest alive until the final whistle.While India celebrated topping Group B and progressing to the semi-finals, the viral “tea celebration” ensured the match remained a talking point off the pitch, adding to the ongoing debate sparked by Haris Rauf’s controversial gesture in cricket hours earlier.","Pakistan lost 2-3 to India in the SAFF U-17 Championship on Monday.

Paris Saint-Germain winger Ousmane Dembele capped off a career-defining year by winning the Ballon d’Or 2025 on Monday, rewarding his pivotal role in PSG’s historic Champions League triumph. The Frenchman edged out Barcelona teenager Lamine Yamal to succeed 2024 winner Rodri as football’s most prestigious individual prize returned to Paris.Dembele, 28, enjoyed a spectacular campaign after being converted into a centre-forward following Kylian Mbappe’s departure to Real Madrid. He delivered an astonishing 35 goals across all competitions, firing PSG to a domestic double and their long-awaited first Champions League crown. The crowning moment came in Munich, where PSG demolished Inter Milan 5-0 in the final.“I really don’t have the words. It was an incredible season with PSG,” said a visibly emotional Dembele at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris. The Frenchman credited head coach Luis Enrique — who also took home the award for club coach of the year — as “like a father” in guiding his transformation.Despite celebrating individual glory, Dembele stressed the team’s role in his success: “It is an individual trophy but it was really the collective that won it.”While Dembele lifted the men’s prize, Aitana Bonmati of Spain claimed the Women’s Ballon d’Or for the third year running, beating her international teammate Mariona Caldentey. Bonmati, 27, starred at Euro 2025 despite Spain losing the final to England, and said her continued success was down to her teams at club and country level.The ceremony also saw Lamine Yamal, still just 18, claim the Kopa Trophy for best young male player for a second consecutive year. PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma took home the Yashin Trophy before his summer move to Manchester City, while England’s Hannah Hampton was named best women’s goalkeeper. England boss Sarina Wiegman won best women’s coach.Dembele’s triumph ends years of Ballon d’Or dominance by Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, and more recently Rodri, underlining PSG’s rise as a true European powerhouse. With his name etched into football history, the 2018 World Cup winner admitted the award had never been a career target but reflected: “I worked hard for the team to win the Champions League — this is the reward.”",Paris Saint-Germain winger Ousmane Dembele wins Ballon d'Or 2025.

In the league, their next fixture is away to Oviedo on Thursday.In a further blow, the club also confirmed midfielder Fermín López suffered a muscle injury in his left leg during the Getafe win.He is expected to be out for around three weeks.The double setback comes at a crucial stage of the season as Barcelona look to keep pace in the title race and continue their strong start in Europe.Hansi Flick's men have already been making do without star man Lamine Yamal, who was injured while on International duty with Spain.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

Taylor Fritz held off Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to seal Team World's triumph in the Laver Cup on Sunday as two wins for Carlos Alcaraz on the final day proved too little for Team Europe.Fritz fired a backhand volley winner on his first match point to give Team World a 15-9 victory over Europe in the global tennis event, sparking jubilant celebrations from his teammates and World captain Andre Agassi at Chase Center -- home of the NBA's Golden State Warriors.""The energy from the team, it just feels the moments of winning feel so much better, the moments of losing feel so much worse because you're doing it for all these guys,"" Fritz said.""It just fires me up so much,"" added the fifth-ranked American, who had beaten Alcaraz on Saturday when Team World swept all four matches to seize a 9-3 lead.Fritz had raced through the opening set against a weary-looking Zverev.The German stepped it up in the second set, but he was down a break and trailing 4-3 before he finally mustered his first break points of the night.He converted his third to level the set at 4-4 to the delight of his Europe teammates and captain Yannick Noah.A quick hold from Zverev left Fritz serving to stay in the set.He held to love and they battled to the tiebreaker, where Fritz took a 3-0 lead only for Zverev to win three straight points before Fritz won four of the final five.Alcaraz, fresh off his sixth Grand Slam title at the US Open, had kept Europe's title defense alive with a blistering 6-2, 6-1 victory over Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo.Alcaraz and Casper Ruud had sliced Europe's deficit with a 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 doubles victory over Reilly Opelka and Alex Michelsen to open Sunday's action.But Australian world number eight Alex De Minaur then beat Czech Jakub Mensik 6-3, 6-4 to push Team World's lead to 12-6, with 13 points needed to claim the Cup and each match on Sunday worth three points.De Minaur, a late replacement on Team World for Frances Tiafoe, had nabbed two wins on Saturday -- beating Zverev in singles and coming through again in doubles.Team World regained the title they surrendered to Europe last year in Berlin.Europe have won five of eight editions of the event co-created by Swiss great Roger Federer , which will be held in London next year.Ruud def.

SHENZHEN: Jasmine Paolini beat Jessica Pegula on the fourth match point as defending champion Italy won the Billie Jean King Cup with a comprehensive victory over the United States on Sunday.Italy won both singles ties in straight sets, meaning there was no need for a decisive doubles match. The No. 8-ranked Paolini beat seventh-ranked Pegula 6-4, 6-2 after No. 91 Elisabetta Cocciaretto won 6-4, 6-4 against Emma Navarro, breaking her serve three times.Paolini broke Pegula's serve with a two-hand backhand down the line to take the first set and move Italy closer to success at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Center Arena in China.But with Paolini serving for the match at 5-1 she wavered a little. Pegula saved three match points and then two unforced errors from Paolini allowed Pegula to break back to 5-2 down.A strong looping forehand gave Paolini - the runner-up at the French Open and Wimbledon last year - a fourth match point and she took it, clinching victory when Pegula's two-handed backhand clipped the net and landed wide.Paolini raised her arms in the air, then walked over to hug her teammates.All the staff members joined them on the court as they danced in a circle before celebrating with blue-shirted, flag-waving Italy fans.Pegula and Navarro each came from a set down to defeat Britain and reach the final.But not this time.Italy boasted a doubles pairing of Olympic champions Paolini and Sara Errani, who also won the French Open doubles together this year. They would have faced Pegula and top-ranked doubles player Taylor Townsend in what might have been an exciting trophy decider.The BJK Cup was formerly known as the Fed Cup, and the United States is the most successful team as an 18-time winner, but not since 2017.Italy was contesting its third straight final and clinched its sixth title.

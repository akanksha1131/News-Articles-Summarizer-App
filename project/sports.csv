Haider Ali : Young career cut short?



Pakistan cricket has been rocked by fresh controversy after young batter Haider Ali was arrested in England over an alleged rape during the Pakistan Shaheens’ tour of the United Kingdom. The 24-year-old, part of the national ‘A’ team, has been provisionally suspended by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) pending investigation.Greater Manchester Police (GMP) confirmed receiving a rape report on Monday. “We have arrested a 24-year-old man… It’s alleged the incident occurred on Wednesday 23 July 2025 at a premises in Manchester. The man has since been bailed pending further enquiries,” the statement read. British police typically do not name suspects at this stage.A PCB spokesperson confirmed: “We have suspended Haider until the investigation is completed and will conduct our own inquiry in the UK.” The board said it would cooperate fully with legal proceedings while providing Haider with legal support.Haider Ali, who debuted in 2020, has played two ODIs and 35 T20Is for Pakistan, scoring 505 T20I runs with three fifties. In first-class cricket, he averages over 47 with 1,797 runs in 27 matches but is yet to play Test cricket.Born in Attock, he made his international debut in Manchester — the same city where the current case has arisen — in a T20I against England on September 1, 2020.Haider last played for Pakistan against Afghanistan at Asian Games in Hangzhou on October 6, 2023.Once considered among Pakistan’s brightest young batting talents, Haider’s career has faced prior setbacks, including a suspension for breaching Covid-19 protocols during the 2021 PSL.The Shaheens’ UK tour (July 17–August 6) included two drawn three-day games and a 2–1 one-day series win.The case evokes memories of Pakistan’s 2010 spot-fixing scandal, when Salman Butt , Mohammad Amir, and Mohammad Asif were jailed in England, underscoring the recurring shadow of controversy over the nation’s cricket.","Pakistan cricketer Haider Ali arrested in England over an alleged rape.

Bowled Over by Miya Magic: Mohammed Siraj shines brightest | IND vs ENG 5th Test

NEW DELHI: India’s Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy campaign ended in dramatic fashion at The Oval, where Shubman Gill ’s transitional side secured a 2–2 draw over England with a thrilling six-run win in the fifth Test. But while the series was a showcase of resilience and experimentation, it also left heartbreak for some in the squad — none more so than Abhimanyu Easwaran The 29-year-old batter, who travelled with the team for the entire five-match series, failed to make the playing XI even once, despite impressing in two India A games before the tour. As the final Test approached, injuries to key players and a shifting team combination seemed to open a door. But the call never came.Speaking to Vickey Lalwani on his YouTube channel, Easwaran’s father, Ranganathan Parameshwaran Easwaran, revealed his son’s frustration.“He was pissed off because he wasn’t picked. When I called him, he said, ‘Dad, I still haven’t found a place,’” Ranganathan said.Despite the snub, Easwaran quickly refocused on the domestic season. “He’ll fly to Bengaluru for Duleep Trophy prep, spend 10–12 days there, come back to Dehradun for a bit, then head back. He was disturbed, but he said, ‘I’ve lived my dream for 23 years, and not getting picked for one or two matches won’t shatter that.’”Ranganathan also disclosed a conversation between his son and head coach Gautam Gambhir that has kept the batter’s spirits high.“Gambhir told him, ‘You’re doing the right things. You’ll get your turn and a long run. I’m not the one to push you out after one or two matches.’ The entire coaching team assured him he’ll get his due,” Ranganathan said.","India's Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy campaign ended in dramatic fashion at The Oval, where Shubman Gill’s transitional side secured a 2–2 draw over England.

NEW DELHI: Former India opener Shikhar Dhawan 's latest social media post has moved fans across the cricketing world, offering a deeply personal glimpse into the life of a player more often seen smiling on the field than speaking of his struggles off it.Sharing a series of affectionate, previously unseen photographs with his son Zoraver, Dhawan penned a heartfelt message on Instagram:“WCL mein jab doston ko apne kids ke saath khelte dekha… bas ek thought aaya, wish Zora was here.

Poll How would you rate Jasprit Bumrah's performance in the recent series against England? Outstanding Good Average Below Expectations

NEW DELHI: India’s hard-fought 2-2 series draw against England in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy produced numerous standout performances, but not everyone lived up to the billing. Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan expressed disappointment in Jasprit Bumrah ’s performance, despite the pacer finishing as one of the top wicket-takers in the series.Bumrah featured in only three of the five Tests due to workload management. While he returned with 14 wickets at an average of 26.00 — including two five-wicket hauls — Pathan felt Bumrah lacked the killer instinct in crucial moments.“Bumrah will get six out of ten,” Pathan said on his YouTube channel. “When you're a senior player, there is a lot of responsibility to win matches. He played three Tests, and India didn’t win any of them.”Citing specific examples, Pathan pointed to the series opener where Bumrah took five wickets in the first innings but failed to pick up a single in the second while defending a sizeable total of 370.“At that crucial time, your main match-winner has to find a way — over the wicket, around the wicket, yorkers, slower balls, bouncers — anything to create pressure.That didn't happen. In the Leeds Test, we did not see that pressure being built. England ended up scoring heavily, and Bumrah did not take a single wicket,” he added.The former pacer also noted Bumrah’s reluctance to stretch spells when India needed breakthroughs. “There were moments, like when a sixth over was needed. Joe Root had been dismissed by him 11 times, and in that Lord's Test, Bumrah bowled just five overs. That one more over could’ve pushed harder. I felt he held back.”While acknowledging Bumrah’s name going up on the Lord’s honours board, Pathan stressed that the world’s top-ranked Test bowler is held to a higher standard.“He took a five-wicket haul and got his name on the Lord's honours board. But when you are the number one bowler, there is an expectation of number one-level performance, and I felt he did not quite live up to that.”",Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan expressed disappointment in Jasprit Bumrah ’s performance.

No Sri Lanka series in August

Pant won’t require surgery

MUMBAI: After being ignored from India’s tour of England this summer, Shreyas Iyer , who is currently only in India’s ODI team, could be in line for a comeback in the T20I and Test team. TOI has learnt that Iyer is likely to be recalled for India’s T20I and Test side when the selectors meet sometime in Aug to pick the squad for the Asia Cup in UAE, which will be played in the T20 format from Sept 9, and the two-Test series against West Indies from Oct 2 in Ahmedabad.The 30-year-old Mumbai cricketer is in serious contention for a spot in the middle order in all formats of the game. “We need Iyer’s class and experience in the middle order in all formats. It’s something which we missed in England during the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy. The selectors are aware that Iyer is an excellent player of spin bowling, which will be crucial in a home season that involves four Tests — two each against West Indies and South Africa,” sources told TOI.Iyer has been picked in the West Zone team for the Duleep Trophy, which will be played at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence from Aug 28. Seeded into the semis by virtue of being the defending champions, West Zone will directly play in the semifinals of the tournament from Sept 4.Iyer has been out of favour in Tests since a back issue and poor form saw him lose his berth during the home series against England last year. The decision-makers, however, feel Iyer has done all the right things since losing his contract after expressing a reluctance to play domestic cricket. The 30-year-old was in decent form for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy , scoring 480 runs at 68.57, with two centuries, in five matches last season.Overall, Iyer has scored 811 runs in 14 Tests at 36.86, including one hundred and five fifties. He played the last of his 14 Tests against England in Vizag in Feb last year. The 30-year-old Mumbaikar was India’s top run-getter in their Champions Trophy triumph in Dubai in March, scoring 243 runs in five matches at an average of 48.60, including two fifties. His knocks of 45 off 62 balls against Australia in the semifinal and 48 off 62 balls in the final proved crucial.Meanwhile, TOI has learnt that middle-order batter Karun Nair suffered a minor fracture on his finger after being struck on the hand by a rising delivery during the second innings of the Oval Test. Nair will not play for Central Zone in the upcoming Duleep Trophy. The 33-year-old batter, who moved back to Karnataka from Vidarbha, scored 205 runs in four Tests at an average of 25.62, with one fifty in the 2025 Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.India will not be going to Sri Lanka for a white-ball series in Aug. It is learnt that post a gruelling five-Test series in England, the Indian team has been given a rare ‘complete rest’ by the BCCI, which means that Team India will only resume playing international cricket with the Asia Cup in Sept. “The players requested for a break after the England series. There is a hectic international schedule for India from Sept, which also involves going to Australia for a white-ball series in Oct,” sources said.Wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant won’t require surgery after a toe fracture during the fourth Test in Manchester. However, Pant has been ruled out of action for at least six weeks.

Ben Stokes press conference: On Mohammed Siraj, Chris Woakes batting with injury, 2-2 result

Poll Do you think Chris Woakes showed exceptional bravery by batting with a shoulder injury? Yes, absolutely No, it was not wise Maybe, depending on the situation

NEW DELHI: England pacer Chris Woakes has opened up about the dramatic final day of the fifth and final Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy against India at The Oval, where he walked out to bat despite a serious shoulder injury. In a candid chat with The Guardian, Woakes shared the pain and emotion behind that courageous moment, and revealed how India captain Shubman Gill praised him for his bravery.Woakes had injured his shoulder while fielding on Day 1 and did not take part in the match afterward, until England were nine wickets down, needing 17 more runs to pull off a historic chase on the final of the series. To the crowd's roaring applause, Woakes emerged from the pavilion with his arm strapped, determined to support teammate Gus Atkinson.""The first one was the worst. All I had taken was codeine and it was just so sore. Instinct took over here – even with my arm strapped down I tried to run as you naturally do. I genuinely worried my shoulder had popped back out again, hence you saw me throw my helmet off, rip the glove off with my teeth, and check it was OK,"" Woakes recalled.Ultimately, Atkinson was bowled and Woakes never faced a ball. But the crowd stood up, and so did the Indian team in appreciation. After the match, Gill walked over to Woakes.“Shubman said something like: ‘That was incredibly brave.’ I told him: ‘You’ve had an unbelievable series, well played, and credit to your team.’ Both sets of players had been through the mill in the series and deserve credit for the show we put on. Both teams wanted the win, of course, but it does kind of feel fair that it was drawn,” Woakes added.Woakes said he felt devastated not to get the fairytale finish.“I’m still gutted, devastated really, that we couldn’t get the fairytale. But I never considered not going out there, even if it had been 100 runs still to win. It was nice to have the ovation and some of the Indian players came over to show their respect. But any other player would have done the same. You couldn’t just call it off at nine wickets down,” he said.","England pacer Chris Woakes has opened up about the dramatic final day of the fifth and final Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy against India.

The reason?

Mohammed Siraj was adjudged the Player of the Match at The Oval. (Getty Images)

Stepping out of the shadows of legends like Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and even Jasprit Bumrah is no easy task. To perform, carve your own identity, and make a statement that says, 'Yes, I’m here too. I can deliver, bleed for my team, play with fire, go full throttle, and rattle the opposition to secure a win' - that takes immense belief. That’s exactly where Mohammed Siraj Team India ’s very own 'Mian' - a nickname fondly given by his teammates - stood tall, firm and etched his name on English soil.Without making much noise, Siraj entered the series - with some expectations, but certainly not as many as those placed on senior pro Jasprit Bumrah . All eyes were on Bumrah to lead India’s bowling attack. He was expected to play only three Tests due to workload management, and rightly so. India’s hopes largely rested on his shoulders.But when the series ended, the man front and centre of every highlights package, every news bulletin, every social media account was a different one.The fans’ affection shifted towards one man. The team leaned on him. He became the nightmare for the opposition. The volume of the ohhhs and aahhs rose, and the man delivered - Siraj.By the end of the series, Siraj emerged as the highest wicket-taker with 23 scalps and was deservedly named Player of the Match at The Oval. More importantly, he stamped his authority - his presence - and without uttering a word, declared: I can lead this pace attack too. The big takeaway is that it all came in Bumrah’s absence. He made it clear: I can be the one who charges in, fierce and fearless.Siraj made his debut in 2020 against Australia when the likes of Bumrah, Ishant Sharma, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav, and Mohammed Shami were already established names. Over time, Ishant, Bhuvneshwar, and Umesh faded from the main frame - and that’s when Siraj’s rise truly began.He played in Australia, England, the West Indies, South Africa, and Bangladesh - took wickets, dismissed big names, became the captain’s trusted option - but the Siraj who could lead the pack was still missing.Then came the England series - perhaps a script written by fate - for Siraj to reveal what had long remained hidden within.When Bumrah plays, the opposition’s focus automatically shifts to him. But Siraj’s numbers tell a different tale - he becomes a different beast when Bumrah is not around.Yes, Siraj with and without Bumrah are two different stories.In the 25 Tests he’s played alongside Bumrah, Siraj has taken 74 wickets at an average of 35.00 and a strike rate of 57.3.But in 16 Tests without Bumrah, Siraj has claimed 49 wickets — at an average of 25.1 and a strike rate of 44.3.There’s more.In the 13 Tests where neither Bumrah nor Shami played, Siraj picked up 43 wickets, averaging 22.83 and striking every 41.2 deliveries.Possibly the leadership instincts that get activated when responsibility falls solely on his shoulders — the hunger to be the main man, the fire to be the captain’s go-to bowler, no matter the situation or conditions.In the fifth and final Test, Siraj gave it everything. Every part of his heart and soul. He hit the right areas, beat batters with nip-backers, deliveries that jagged in, balls that angled across, jaffas, inswingers, and outswingers. He kept everyone on the edge of their seats. It was nerve-wracking, heart-pounding stuff. He was exhausted, down but never out.Injuries struck the team, but Siraj stayed firm - his message loud in action: 'Don’t worry, I’m here'.He bowled 1,113 deliveries in the series - the most by any bowler - across all 10 innings of a five-match Test series. That’s an enormous workload. But Siraj made the Herculean effort look routine. And this wasn’t the first time. He had bowled 953 deliveries in the 2024 away series against Australia.This is why Siraj is Team India’s true workhorse — constantly challenging the theories of “workload management.”Then came that nail-biting final day at The Oval. England needed 35 runs. India needed 4 wickets. Pressure was at its peak. All eyes turned to one man — Siraj.When Jamie Overton smacked two early boundaries off Prasidh Krishna, many began to lose hope. But not Siraj. Silently, he took the ball, had a brief chat with captain Shubman Gill, and walked back to his mark.Then came the moment.He knocked over Gus Atkinson’s stumps. Arms spread. A leap. The Siuu celebration (just like Cristiano Ronaldo). Teammates rushing in. It was Siraj’s stage. His win. His story. He didn’t shout. He didn’t boast. He just showed up, over and over again — confident, consistent, committed.And when asked what kept him going, what kept the fire alive, he had just one word: Believe.",Mohammed Siraj was adjudged the Player of the Match at The Oval. Siraj emerged as the highest wicket-taker with 23 scalps. He stamped his authority - his presence - and declared: I can lead this pace attack too. India's hopes largely rested on his shoulders.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123155687,imgsize-50878,width-400,resizemode-4/123155687.jpg"

Ben Stokes press conference: On Mohammed Siraj, Chris Woakes batting with injury, 2-2 result

Poll What was your reaction to Chris Woakes walking out to bat injured? Inspired Concerned Impressed

NEW DELHI: In a finale befitting a blockbuster series, England all-rounder Chris Woakes delivered one of the most courageous moments of the summer — walking out to bat with a dislocated shoulder during a tense chase against India in the fifth and final Test at The Oval.With England needing 17 runs and just one wicket remaining, Woakes, officially ruled out of the match on Day 1 due to injury, strode to the crease to a standing ovation. His left arm was strapped tightly in a sling under his sweater. Despite the intense pain — and even more intense pressure — Woakes was ready to face the fury of India’s fast bowlers.“The first one was the worst,” Woakes told The Guardian. “All I had taken was codeine and it was just so sore. Instinct took over – even with my arm strapped down I tried to run as you naturally do. I genuinely worried my shoulder had popped back out again, hence you saw me throw my helmet off, rip the glove off with my teeth, and check it was OK.”He did not face a single delivery. But just being there mattered. “It was bittersweet in the end. Part of me wondered what it might be like… to see if I could have defended the ball, seen out an over maybe, squeezed a run or carved a four,” he said.“But the other side of it was: ‘Thank God I didn’t face a 90mph bouncer, one-handed, facing the wrong way around.’”Woakes added 10 valuable runs with Gus Atkinson before Mohammed Siraj ended England’s hopes with a sizzling yorker to dismiss the latter.Despite the heartbreak, Woakes never considered staying back. “I’m still gutted, devastated really, that we couldn’t get the fairytale. But I never considered not going out there, even if it had been 100 runs still to win.”India clinched the Test by six runs, squaring the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy 2-2. Woakes didn’t face a ball — but earned the respect of fans and players on both sides.","England all-rounder Chris Woakes walked out to bat with a dislocated shoulder.

Poll Should Karun Nair be given another chance in the Indian Test team? Yes, he deserves another chance No, it's time for new talent

‘Vulnerable against the short ball'

CHENNAI: ""Dear cricket, give me one more chance."" Karun Nair's desperate plea struck an immediate chord with those who had seen the hard-working middle-order batter go through the grind of domestic cricket, year after year.The Indian team management, often known to be slightly impatient with a lot of things, also seemed to notice, making an exception for the 33-year-old for the five-Test series in England.The Karnataka cricketer, who will return to his home state next season after excelling for Vidarbha, got four Tests in England, batting at positions 3, 5 and 6. His fighting 57 in the first innings at the Oval, when the ball was doing quite a bit, played a significant role in India getting a respectable score.But in a series which has been dominated by Indian batters, a total of 205 runs at an average of 25.67 aren't exactly the returns that Nair may have been hoping for ahead of the series.But then, Sai Sudharsan, who made his debut in the series and is being seen as a long-term prospect, too got 140 runs in six innings. One feels that the team management has decided to persist with Sai as the long-term No. 3 for now, unless something goes drastically wrong.With Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar excelling with the bat, there's only one spot left in the middle-order when India play West Indies at home in two months' time, and there are contenders for that spot.While Sarfaraz Khan has been with the team for a while and has lost weight to look in fine physical shape, Shreyas Iyer is gunning for a red-ball return. The Mumbai batter, who had a fine IPL, is excellent against spin and it is going to be a tough call for the team management and the selection committee when they sit down to discuss Nair's Test future.Former India opener Deep Dasgupta, who was in England as part of the commentary panel, feels Nair isn't exactly a No. 3 batter for challenging overseas conditions. ""His feet don't move enough to be successful at No. 3. In that case, the options become limited and when it's a choice for Nos. 6 or 7, there are too many options. It's not just Shreyas and Sarfaraz. Even Axar Patel or Nitish Reddy can come into the picture depending on the nature of the pitches India are playing on,"" Dasgupta told TOI from London.Devang Gandhi, a former national selector and an opening batter himself, too feels there is a serious technical deficiency in Karun's game that may go against him. ""At the point of release of the ball from the bowler's hand, Karun's front foot is still in the air. That makes him vulnerable against the short ball, as we found out in this series. There's no doubt he has scored some tough runs, but it has to be taken into account that he couldn't convert the starts that he got,"" Gandhi said.According to him, the selection process sometimes becomes more of a ""case of elimination than selection"", and Nair could find it difficult to retain his spot.In such a scenario, the ball could entirely be in the team management's court. It will be very interesting to see how coach Gautam Gambhir looks at Nair's contributions in the series. The 57 at the Oval was indication enough that in Indian conditions against lesser attacks, Karun will get runs. But the call that Gambhir has to take is whether he has seen enough in Nair's game that will help him get runs in New Zealand next year or the WTC Final in England, if India go that far.""We have a core in place and the team should now be built with an eye on the difficult away series in future,"" Dasgupta said. If that's the case, Nair may well have played his last Test for India.But even if that's true, the half-century at the Oval will never be forgotten by those who have savoured the comeback of this lion-hearted cricketer.","Karun Nair made a famous comeback in England but his middling returns with the bat may go against him.

Poll Who was the standout bowler on Day 1 of the second Test match? Matt Henry Zakary Foulkes

New Zealand's fast bowlers dominated Zimbabwe on Day 1 of the second Test match in Bulawayo, with Matt Henry taking 5-40 and debutant Zakary Foulkes claiming 4-38 to dismiss the hosts for 125. The Kiwi opening pair of Will Young and Devon Conway then propelled their team to 174-1, establishing a 49-run lead by stumps on Thursday.Matt Henry continued his exceptional form from the first Test, where he had claimed nine wickets, by leading the bowling attack against a struggling Zimbabwe batting lineup.Will Young scored 74 runs with 11 fours before being dismissed, while Devon Conway remained unbeaten on 79. The duo shared a commanding 162-run opening partnership before Young chopped Trevor Gwandu's short ball onto his stumps.Brendan Taylor, returning to Test cricket after a 3½-year ban for violating multiple ICC codes of conduct, managed 44 runs off 107 balls in what he described as a ""debut-like feeling.""Zimbabwe's batting woes continued from their nine-wicket defeat in the first Test, despite New Zealand missing fast bowlers Nathan Smith and Will O'Rourke due to injuries.The three debutant New Zealand fast bowlers - Foulkes, Jacob Duffy, and Matthew Fisher - complemented Henry's bowling masterclass after Zimbabwe captain Craig Ervine won the toss and chose to bat.Zimbabwe wicketkeeper-batsman Tafadzwa Tsiga remained unbeaten on 33 and participated in a 25-run last-wicket partnership before Fisher claimed his debut wicket by dismissing Tanaka Chivanga.Taylor, who replaced Ben Curran in the top order, showed resilience while wickets tumbled around him in the opening session. His return began shakily when Duffy's short ball edged off his bat and flew over the wicketkeeper for a boundary.Henry struck early, having Brian Bennett caught by Young in the second slip for zero. He then trapped Nick Welch leg before wicket for 11 with a delivery that nipped back.Foulkes troubled the batsmen consistently, eventually getting Sean Williams caught by Young in the second slip. He also dismissed Ervine for 7, with Young taking his third catch in the slips.Zimbabwe's situation worsened after lunch as they lost three wickets in eight deliveries, collapsing to 83-7. Taylor's resistance ended when he chipped a simple catch to captain Mitchell Santner at extra cover off Henry.Sikandar Raza fell to Foulkes' short ball, caught by Rachin Ravindra at leg slip, while Trevor Gwandu was given out leg before wicket without scoring.Henry completed his five-wicket haul by bowling Vincent Masekesa and Blessing Muzarabani in consecutive overs, before Fisher wrapped up Zimbabwe's innings.The New Zealand opening pair then dominated the final session, establishing a strong position for their team by the end of day's play.","New Zealand's fast bowlers dominated Zimbabwe on Day 1 of the second Test match in Bulawayo.

NEW DELHI: Indian pacer Harshit Rana recently opened up about a heated on-field exchange with Australian speedster Mitchell Starc during the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, where he peppered Starc with bouncers before dismissing him for 26 — all while receiving spirited backing from senior pros Virat Kohli and KL Rahul The duel ignited when Rana unleashed a barrage of short balls at Starc, one of which struck the Aussie on the helmet. Starc, also his Kolkata Knight Riders teammate in the IPL, responded with a trademark smirk and a warning:""Harshit, I bowl faster than you. I've got a long memory.""Speaking on the BeerBiceps podcast, Rana shared his thoughts during that tense moment, admitting a mix of adrenaline and fear as he walked back to his mark.“I bowled him a bouncer after a long time. One hit his helmet. When he sledged, I just laughed. But while walking back, I thought, ‘Mar gaya, ab ye mujhe bouncer maarega!’”“And then from behind, Virat bhai and KL bhai were shouting from the slips — ‘Maarta reh, maarta reh, idhar hi maar isko!’ I thought, ‘Bhaiya aap toh bach jaoge, mere toh lagne wali hai!’”As fate would have it, Starc did retaliate later, striking Rana on the helmet during the second Test.But the young Indian pacer took it in stride, chalking it up to the spirit of the contest.Rana's journey with the Indian team has had its ups and downs. While he has impressed in phases — including his stint in Australia — consistency at the international level has remained elusive.Most recently, he was part of the Test squad against England as a backup but was later released. Nevertheless, Rana remains an active contributor in white-ball formats and was a member of the Indian side that clinched the Champions Trophy.","Indian pacer Harshit Rana opened up about a heated on-field exchange with Australian speedster Mitchell Starc.

NEW DELHI: India's World Cup-winning former coach Gary Kirsten has expressed his admiration for the manner in which Gautam Gambhir shepherded the team to a creditable 2-2 draw on the tough Test tour of England recently.India and England settled for a stalemate after five intensely fought Tests played across nearly two months.""I'm really happy for the Indian cricket team for levelling the series and it's great for Indian cricket. I'm really pleased for Gautam Gambhir as well, I know him well. Really delighted and pleased for what he's achieved with the team,"" Kirsten told reporters on the sidelines of an event here.""They're (India) doing really well at the moment. We all get excited by the success of the Indian team, I certainly do. They've got a great bunch of young players coming through now and it's really exciting to be supporting them,"" added Kirsten.Having lost the series opener at Leeds, India staged a remarkable comeback to level the rubber, which concluded with the visitors' famous win at the Oval.India won the 2011 World Cup at home under Kirsten's guidance and also reached the number one position in the Test format during his time with the team.Gambhir was part of that World Cup-winning team as Virender Sehwag's opening partner and played a fine knock of 97 in the final against Sri Lanka.Recalling his tenure as coach in this part of the world, Kirsten said one of his highlights of his stint with India was getting Ishant Sharma to practice batting at nets and eventually help VVS Laxman to save a Test against Australia in Mohali in 2010.""One highlight in my three years with the Indian team was getting Ishant Sharma to come down to the nets with his batting pads and then to get him to face 48 balls in the Test match against Australia with VVS Laxman to win the game. That was a highlight for me to work on his batting.""I really enjoyed that from a leadership perspective because he didn't think he could bat. And he still can't bat that well, but we kind of helped him get through that Test match and do really well,"" Kirsten said.Set a target of 216, India were left staring down the barrel at 124 for eight but Laxman (73 not out), first with Ishant (31), and then alongside No.11 Pragyan Ojha, guided India to a memorable one-wicket win.",India's World Cup-winning former coach Gary Kirsten has expressed his admiration for the manner in which Gautam Gambhir shepherded the team to a creditable 2-2 draw.

Inside The Oval: An Exclusive Tour of the Stadium Where India Played the Final Test

Poll Should the ICC implement a two-division World Test Championship to enhance competition? Yes, it could strengthen the format. No, it may harm traditional rivalries. Maybe, if it supports smaller nations.

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) is not in favour of a two-division World Test Championship (WTC), especially if it risks England being placed in a different division from Australia or India. That could mean missing out on two of their biggest and most profitable rivalries.Last month, the ICC formed a working group, led by former New Zealand batter Roger Twose, to explore ways to improve the WTC from the 2027 cycle onwards. A two-tier structure was one of the main ideas discussed at the ICC’s annual meet in July. Twose, who sits on the ICC Board on behalf of New Zealand Cricket, is expected to make formal recommendations soon.The idea of a tiered Test system has been around for more than 15 years. While the ICC has shown interest as far back as 2009, its members have remained divided over the model.During the opening day of the fifth Test at The Oval, ECB chairman Richard Thompson shared his thoughts on BBC's Test Match Special. He said the value of bilateral cricket was dropping due to a packed calendar dominated by T20 leagues, which has hurt Test cricket in most countries.While acknowledging that the ICC is considering the two-tier model, he admitted it may not be the ideal solution.Thompson said, “There are many options on the table. Tiers are one of them. But if England has a dip in form, should that mean we’re dropped into Division Two and don’t play India or Australia? That shouldn’t happen. We need to apply some common sense.”He felt that the current WTC format could be improved instead. He pointed to South Africa’s surprise win in the 2023-25 cycle as a great example of how underdog teams can rise with the right backing.“The WTC has helped create a narrative and added meaning. Seeing South Africa win was powerful. I know people like Graeme Smith , and to see him in tears on the outfield showed how much it meant. Despite my criticism of their ‘B’ team against New Zealand, their win was still good for the game.”Thompson added that rather than changing the format completely, the scheduling of matches needed a rethink. He also flagged the complications that would arise in 2028 when cricket is part of the Olympics.“We’ll face challenges when our best players need to be in Los Angeles in mid-July. That will need to be factored into the calendar.”The composition of the WTC working group is still unclear, but reports suggest an eight-member committee could be formed, including representatives from non-Test nations. New ICC CEO Sanjog Gupta is also expected to be involved.With bilateral series already being discussed for the 2027-29 cycle and media rights tenders coming up, the ICC is under pressure to make the WTC more effective. Still, resistance remains high.Full Member nations have long been split on the idea. Some fear financial losses from relegation, others worry about national pride, and a few reject the concept altogether.Cricket Australia CEO Todd Greenberg, another key voice in the debate, believes bigger nations must support smaller ones in keeping Test cricket alive. Speaking to SEN Radio, he said a strong West Indies, Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa is in everyone’s interest.“Those countries can’t do it alone. We all need to help. I’ve spoken to many board CEOs and there’s a shared understanding that some changes are needed to bring more value to Test cricket.”Greenberg said he is open to the two-tier idea only if it genuinely helps smaller countries grow stronger.“If it gives them more resources and opportunities, I’ll support it. But if it ends up hurting them, then I won’t.”He mentioned that during the recent ICC chief executives meeting in Singapore, several others expressed the same willingness to find a positive path forward.",ICC is considering a two-division World Test Championship. England and Wales Cricket Board are not in favour of the idea. ECB chairman Richard Thompson believes the current WTC format could be improved instead. ICC working group led by Roger Twose is looking at ways to improve WTC.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123167937,imgsize-116920,width-400,resizemode-4/123167937.jpg"

Inside The Oval: An Exclusive Tour of the Stadium Where India Played the Final Test

Poll Do you agree with Deep Dasgupta's criticism of India's announcement regarding Bumrah's limited availability? Yes, it was unnecessary. No, it was a strategic decision.

Former India wicketkeeper-batter Deep Dasgupta has criticized the Indian cricket team's decision to announce Jasprit Bumrah 's limited availability of three Tests before the recent Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series in England, which ended in a 2-2 draw. Dasgupta believes this pre-series announcement was unnecessary and the team could have made decisions based on physical conditions and series scenarios. Bumrah participated in three Tests during the series - the first Test at Headingley, Leeds, followed by matches at Lord's and Old Trafford, Manchester. He secured 14 wickets, including two five-wicket hauls, bowling 119.4 overs at an average of 26.The fast bowler was not included in the playing eleven for the fifth Test at The Oval and was released from the squad before day two's play.""Well, I think India shouldn't have announced the fact that he would be playing only three Test matches prior to departing for the series. I mean, you can always take a call on his availability as and when based on his physical situation and series scenario. But this thing of saying that he will be playing only three Test matches before the series has started, I think India could have avoided it,"" Dasgupta told IANS.Dasgupta questioned India's approach to managing Bumrah's workload, which involves giving him adequate rest and playing him in crucial matches.""It depends on obviously him and the medical staff. But how I see it is, he's the best bowler in the world across three formats. So, you want him for all the crucial games. But then once he's available for the crucial ones, then I guess it can't be at the start of a tournament, that I'm going to play only 40% or 60% of the games - that can't happen.""""I mean, keep him ready for the crucial ones, and make sure he's available for all games. Then obviously, if there are injuries, if the body has taken a toll and he's not ready, that's a different issue altogether. But this availability for 50%, 60%, and all, I think that needs to be looked into because he is by far the best bowler in the world right now,"" he added.In Bumrah's absence at The Oval, Prasidh Krishna stepped up with impressive performance, taking four wickets in each innings for a match total of 8-188.Despite facing criticism on social media for underwhelming performances in the first two Tests at Headingley and Edgbaston, Krishna finished the series strongly with his performance at The Oval.""With Prasidh, he's a quality bowler. I mean, his release is the best in this Indian team in terms of his backspin and seam position, and skill-wise, he's right up there. Only thing is, obviously, over the years, even though he made his first-class debut a long time ago, because of injuries and all, he hasn't really played a lot of cricket and never got into a rhythm.""""He would play a Test match or two, and then get injured. But then, also in the first few Test matches, I don't think he was used well. By the time the last Test came, he got some rhythm and bowled the way he generally bowls. So a lot of credit to him, and I hope this gives him a lot of confidence and he plays a lot because, again, he's found his rhythm. I hope he goes back to India and keeps bowling in future matches,"" Dasgupta concluded.The decision to manage Bumrah's workload came after he suffered a back injury in the Sydney Test against Australia in January this year, as explained by chief selector Ajit Agarkar and head coach Gautam Gambhir before the team's departure for England.",Former India wicketkeeper-batter Deep Dasgupta has criticized the Indian cricket team's decision to announce Jasprit Bumrah's limited availability of three Tests before the recent Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series in England.

Paris Saint-Germain forward Ousmane Dembélé and England forward Chloe Kelly are among the contenders to win the men's and women's Ballon d'Or award. The 30 men's and 30 women's nominees were revealed Thursday by France Football magazine, with the winners to be announced at a ceremony in Paris on September 22.The 28-year-old Dembélé was inspirational in leading PSG to its first Champions League title after years of falling short and helped the French club complete a treble.Teenage star Lamine Yamal, whose mesmerizing performances lit up the Champions League and helped Barcelona win the Spanish league title, is among the other men’s nominees.When England won the women's European Championship last month, the 27-year-old Kelly blasted home the decisive penalty in the final against World Cup winner Spain. She also played a key role earlier in the tense knockout stages.Last season, Kelly played on the right flank as Arsenal won the women’s Champions League with another against-the-odds win over powerhouse Barcelona.She faces competition from defender Lucy Bronze and goalkeeper Hannah Hampton — her England teammates who both play for Chelsea — and from Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmatí, the winner of the past two awards.Barcelona players have won the past four women's awards.

Poll Do you support the AIFF's proposal to hold the Super Cup tournament from mid-September? Yes, it will provide necessary competitive matches. No, it disrupts the traditional football calendar.

The All India Football Federation proposed on Thursday to hold the Super Cup tournament from mid-September, aiming to provide Indian Super League clubs with sufficient competitive matches amid uncertainty over the ISL season's start date and format. The proposal came during a meeting with ISL club representatives who have expressed concerns about the upcoming season being put on hold due to issues with the Master Rights Agreement renewal.Representatives from Mohun Bagan Super Giant, East Bengal, and Odisha FC participated virtually in the meeting, while representatives from the other 10 ISL clubs attended in person in New Delhi.""AIFF proposes that the Super Cup football tournament start from second or third week of September to ensure the ISL clubs get enough competitive matches. The AIFF and all the 13 ISL clubs collectively took the decision in national interest. We will meet again in 7 to 10 days and take a final decision,"" said AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey.""We are hoping to have ISL this season though it may be a bit late. But we can do it with certain changes, may be in format or other things. But that will be decided later, no decision on those things yet,"" Chaubey added regarding the ISL uncertainty.The Super Cup, typically held at the season's end, is now likely to commence the season. The tournament is expected to conclude before India's AFC Asian Cup qualification matches against Singapore on October 9 and 14.The Indian Super League usually runs from September to April. The current Master Rights Agreement between Football Sports Development Limited, the ISL organizer, and AIFF is set to expire on December 8, 2025.The uncertainty has already impacted several clubs. Chennaiyin FC announced a temporary suspension of operations for their first-team players and staff on Wednesday, following similar moves by Bengaluru FC and Odisha FC.The decision about the Super Cup's timing comes as a response to the current situation surrounding the ISL's future. The federation and clubs are working to ensure competitive football continues despite the challenges with the league's organization.The rescheduling of the Super Cup represents a significant change in the Indian football calendar, as it moves from its traditional end-of-season slot to potentially becoming the season opener.The AIFF and club representatives are expected to meet again within 7-10 days to finalize the arrangements and make concrete decisions about both tournaments' formats and schedules.","The All India Football Federation proposed on Thursday to hold the Super Cup tournament from mid-September.

Poll How concerned are you about the uncertainty facing players in the Indian Super League? Very concerned Somewhat concerned Not very concerned

KOLKATA: Playing for Jamshedpur FC , Mohammed Sanan had a brilliant last season as the team made it to the semifinals of the Indian Super League (ISL) playoffs and the Super Cup final. His good showing also helped him get a call-up to the India U-23 side that played two friendlies against Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic.But along with hundreds of footballers across the country, his world too faces great uncertainty due to the uncertainty over this season’s ISL, which was put on hold last month. Sanan didn’t hold back when asked about it.“I am worried, yes. I was just talking to the team’s media manager about what is going to happen and like when will the season start? We don’t do anything other than playing football. And this is our job. We can’t wait for it to start,” Sanan told TOI on Wednesday.“All I know is to play football. So, if I am not able to play, then what else should I do? I’ll be jobless and sitting at home.”Not just Sanan but Nikhil Barla, who was part of the U23 side with Sanan, too, shared the same emotions. “What’s happening in Indian football right now is not great for the players. This affects the players’ mentality because we don’t know what will happen in the future, and nothing is clear yet,” Barla said.For the player from Khunti, Jharkhand, who lost his father in 2014, this, naturally, is affecting his performance on the field too.“It affects our confidence and performance because our future depends on our football career, and if this stops, it will be a big crisis for players,” added the 22-year-old, who unlike many others has been lucky to be a part of the ongoing Durand Cup alongside other JFC players.In times of such crisis, the one silver lining for the duo and it is that they have been playing under Khalid Jamil, only recently been given the reins of the Indian men’s senior national team.Speaking about their experience with Jamil, Sanan said, “It feels special and honoured to play under him and it’s a big achievement for us too because our team performed well and that’s why he was chosen for the national team.”On what makes Jamil special, Sanan added, “He’s a very hard-working coach. He never takes a day off, and when there is no training, he always calls the players and arranges meetings with them.”Barla is now looking forward to JFC’s next group game against 1 Ladakh FC on Friday, which incidentally will be Jamil’s first game since being named the India coach. While all eyes will be on Jamil, Barla is not too concerned about it. “It will be like any other match, and the mentality will remain the same,” he said.Having said that, Jamil will certainly look to win the tournament and hope to see his team put up an impressive show against the debutants from Ladakh.",Mohammed Sanan and Nikhil Barla were part of the India U-23 side that played two friendlies against Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic.

Panaji:





It’s not just the players, officials and support staff who are sweating due to the uncertainty swirling around Indian football . TOI has learnt that nine match officials -- including three FIFA referees and three FIFA assistant referees -- contracted with the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on full-time basis, have told the federation that the lack of clarity over the season could force them to seek alternative employment.According to sources, the referees receive a fixed monthly payment of Rs 80,000 from the AIFF, besides Rs 20,000 for every match they officiate in the top tier. Assistant referees are paid Rs 60,000 as fixed sum and Rs 15,000 in match fees.“Many of us have dedicated ourselves fully to this role, even stepping away from other professional opportunities in order to focus solely on refereeing at the highest level,” the referees said in their letter to AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey on Tuesday. “The lack of certainty regarding continuation of ISL has created uncertainty around our future and could compel us to seek alternative employment, which would not only impact our livelihoods but also affect the continuity and development of professional refereeing in India. ”Contracted till August 31, the referees have asked the AIFF to “consider extending our contracts at the earliest, so we may continue contributing to Indian football with full focus and commitment.”Indian football is facing an unprecedented crisis due to uncertainty over the top-tier Indian Super League (ISL) with FSDL, the federation’s marketing partners, keeping the season on hold “until further clarity emerges on the contractual structure beyond the end of current MRA term” on Dec 8 this year. AIFF has said its hands are tied due to an oral order from the Supreme Court that bars them from taking any decision on the renewal of the contract until the final order.Clubs, worried, are hoping that they will have some clarity after their meeting with Chaubey on Thursday. While eight clubs had officially sought an appointment, four more are expected to join hands and seek clarity.Sources said two senior FSDL officials will attend the meeting in the Capital.The meeting comes amid growing concern over the future of several clubs. Odisha FC, “after careful and thorough consideration, and in alignment with the evolving situation,” suspended all player and staff contracts with effect from August 5, while Bengaluru FC – captained by India legend Sunil Chhetri -- said they are “constrained to temporarily suspend all remuneration payments to all players and technical staff, with immediate effect. ”Constrained by circumstances, Chennaiyin FC were the latest to suspend all activities of the club on Wednesday.“All clubs are constantly in touch with both, FSDL and AIFF, to keep us apprised on any developments, hoping that the impasse will be resolved sooner than later,” the club’s general manager Ekansh Gupta told all players and technical staff via email on Wednesday. “We are also keeping an eye on the Supreme Court’s listing of the AIFF matter. All of us in the ecosystem are doing everything we can to ensure a positive outcome. ”","Nine match officials contracted with the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on full-time basis.

Poll Will Son Heung-min's presence boost LAFC's chances for the MLS Cup? Definitely Possibly Not likely

Son Heung-min has completed a sensational move to Los Angeles FC, signing a contract with the Major League Soccer (MLS) club on Tuesday. The 33-year-old South Korean forward ended his 10-year stint at Tottenham Hotspur, marking the end of an era in North London and the beginning of a new chapter in Southern California.Son was spotted in a luxury suite at BMO Stadium during LAFC’s Leagues Cup match against Tigres on Tuesday night. The club is expected to unveil him formally at a press conference on Wednesday. LAFC reportedly paid over $20 million for the transfer — potentially a record-breaking fee in MLS history.During his time at Spurs, Son became a fan favourite and one of the Premier League’s brightest stars, scoring 173 goals in 454 appearances. His departure was marked by an emotional farewell in Seoul last week, where he received a guard of honor and a standing ovation from nearly 65,000 fans during Tottenham’s exhibition against Newcastle.Los Angeles is a symbolic and strategic destination for Son. Home to the largest Korean population outside of Korea, the city offers the perfect platform for Son to extend his influence off the pitch, much like Shohei Ohtani has done with the LA Dodgers in Major League Baseball.Son’s move also reunites him with former Spurs captain Hugo Lloris, now LAFC’s goalkeeper. With LAFC sitting sixth in the Western Conference and chasing another MLS Cup, Son’s arrival is expected to inject pace, creativity, and firepower into the squad.Despite a quieter Premier League season by his standards, Son remains a world-class talent and will likely be a major force in MLS.

In a dramatic and worrying development for Indian football, Indian Super League (ISL) side Bengaluru FC have announced the indefinite suspension of salaries for its first-team players and staff, including iconic striker and former national team captain Sunil Chhetri The decision comes amid escalating uncertainty around the future of the ISL, which remains suspended following an unresolved standoff between Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) and the All India Football Federation (AIFF).Bengaluru FC took to social media on Monday to deliver the difficult news to fans and stakeholders, stating, “In view of the uncertainty surrounding the future of the Indian Super League season, Bengaluru Football Club has taken what is a very difficult decision of indefinitely suspending the salaries of players and staff belonging to the First Team. Running and sustaining a football club in India has always been an uphill climb, one that we have put everything aside and made, season after season. ”The club emphasised the emotional toll the situation is taking on the team and their families, adding, “However, the lack of clarity on the League's future leaves us with no choice but to take this step. The future and well-being of our players, staff, and their families is of utmost importance to us, and we are in touch with them as we wait for a resolution.”While this suspension applies to first-team operations, the club has assured that its youth development programmes and grassroots operations remain unaffected: “The Club remains committed to growing and developing the sport and our operations with our youth teams – men and women – and BFC Soccer Schools remain unaffected by this decision. We urge the AIFF and FSDL to end this impasse swiftly. The uncertainty benefits no one, and a prompt resolution is vital for the future of Indian football. ”This move comes just two weeks after Sunil Chhetri himself raised concerns about the bleak outlook for Indian football. On July 16, he wrote on X: “It began with worrying about how I am on borrowed time with what I have left in the tank. But speaking with players from across clubs, I’ve realised that my selfish problem isn’t as important.“Everybody in the Indian football ecosystem is worried, hurt, scared about the uncertainty we are faced with.”The AIFF is expected to meet with club CEOs soon in an attempt to find common ground and salvage what remains of the season.",Bengaluru FC have announced the indefinite suspension of salaries for its first- team players and staff.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

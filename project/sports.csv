'Jay Shah has the opportunity to take cricket to another level but without making it under the yoke of India': Outgoing ICC chair Greg Barclay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/jay-shah-has-the-opportunity-to-take-cricket-to-another-level-but-without-making-it-under-the-yoke-of-india-outgoing-icc-chair-greg-barclay/articleshow/115989792.cms,"Jay Shah (L) became ICC chair on December 1 with Greg Barclay (R) stepping down.

'Not the Afghanistan board's fault'

Greg Barclay , who made way for Jay Shah as the International Cricket Council (ICC chairperson on December 1, believes the former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary has it in him to help the sport grow and reach the “another level”. However, he added that Shah must take all members together on this journey and not keep it ""under the yoke of India.""Barclay, who was ICC chair for four years from 2020, said the Indian cricket team and BCCI under Shah’s leadership can use their influence to grow the game globally and benefit growing nations.“I think he (Shah) has got a great opportunity to use what he’s got in his background to help India take the game to another level, but without making it sort of under the yoke of India as well,” Barclay was quoted as saying by“We’re really lucky to have India, they’re a massive contributor to the game across all the measures, but one country having that amount of power and influence does distort a whole lot of other outcomes, which is not necessarily helpful in terms of that global growth.”“There are a number of things that India could do to help unite and grow the game, including commercially helping to pool off-shore rights, using their teams to give opportunity to smaller full members and emerging countries, using their clout to open new territories and markets, collaborating closely with the ICC to help benefit members, as examples,” he said.Barclay, who stepped down from his role on December 1, in the midst of an ongoing crisis over the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy, admitted there was plenty of cricket being played that he had lost track of the calendar.In his tenure of two terms of two years each, three major franchise-based T20 leagues popped up, in the USA, the UAE and South Africa, further busying an already packed calendar. He blamed the members' self-interest for the situation.""I reckon, gee, I'm at the apex of the game and I can't tell you who's playing around the world. In fact, I didn't realise that Sri Lanka were in South Africa until I read about Marco Jansen's seven wickets this morning,"" Barclay said. ""So we've lost perspective. It's not great for the game at all. It's a mess. The calendar is incredibly congested and self-interest is such that it's almost impossible to untangle all of that, because no one's going to give up their content.""The Canadian-New Zealand sports administrator also defended the governing body's decision not to sanction Afghanistan’s Full Membership status for Afghanistan Cricket Board not fielding a women's team. Fielding a women's team is integral to getting Full Membership with the ICC.""It is not the Afghanistan board's fault. They used to have women's cricket. I think our approach has been right,"" he said. ""It would be easy to kick Afghanistan out, but their board haven't done anything wrong. They're just working under a decree and a series of laws that says this is what you have to do. I don't think it would make a jot of difference to the ruling party there to kick them out.""Maybe I'm a little naïve, but I think cricket is such a force for good there, and it brings a lot of joy to a lot of people. It is better to leave it there and hope that it can foster a bit of a change.""He did point to the double standards of the national cricket boards, such as Cricket Australia, who have cancelled multiple bilateral series with Afghanistan but have played them at ICC events.""If you really want to make a political statement, don't play them in a World Cup. Sure, it might cost you a semi-final place, but principles are principles. It's not about having half a principle.""","Greg Barclay steps down as International Cricket Council (ICC) chair on December 1.

India vs Australia, 2nd Test: Facing the Pink Ball has different set of challenges for batters

Sold-out seats, and 6 mm grass

Spin factor and other tricks, and thunderstorms too!

ADELAIDE: Damian Hough offers a sheepish smile when asked about the drop-in pitch debacle in New York during the T20 World Cup earlier this year.The Adelaide Oval curator, whose team was in charge of preparing those fresh surfaces, now has an even more important task at hand -he must ensure the second Test between India and Australia doesn't end in a heap of quick wickets and lead to similar accusations of farce.""Both the drop-in pitches are challenging, we'll leave it at that,"" he offered. ""New York was a great opportunity to get over there and learn. Anything you do in such a short time keeps you awake at night. But there's nothing bigger than India and Australia in a Test match.""The brief sample size of pink-ball Tests, played only since Nov 2015, makes it difficult for the experienced curator to offer an educated guess on the expected duration of the game. One thing, though, is clear: these games, cooked up to draw in the evening crowd to the longer format, tend to finish quicker.The general perception that pink-ball affairs are a nightmare for batters is spot on, since of the 22 pink-ball Tests played, only six have lasted the full distance of five days. Seven have ended within four days, seven within three days and two games within two days, in Ahmedabad (2021) and Port Elizabeth (2017).Maybe it's because the seam, or the ball itself, can be difficult for batters to spot, or perhaps because it jags around in the in-between twilight hours with the lights on, or even because of the early swing. Also, the jury is still out on the lacquer on the ball.It's also clear truncated pink-ball Tests are not limited to the hard and bouncy surfaces of Australia, or Adelaide in particular. In fact, Adelaide isn't particularly notorious - out of seven games, two have lasted the duration. There have also been two three-day finishes and three four-day affairs.Of the last seven pink-ball Tests played across the world, only the 2021 Adelaide game between Australia and England has been played across five days. But it was also here that Australia rolled India over for 36 in Dec 2020, with fast bowler Josh Hazlewood , who is sitting this game out, taking 5/8 in India's second innings.""Back in the day, Adelaide was known for bat-a-thons and draws,"" Hough said. ""Do you want a five-day draw out of it? Obviously not. But do you want a two-and-a-half-day game? No, you don't. Wickets falling can be exciting, but 10 wickets and 300 runs would be ideal. You've got to get that balance right. The fans come (tickets are sold out at the 53,500-seat stadium). We play our role, but the players play the game at the end of the day.""Nearly 6 mm of grass has been left on the pitch, the same as in the '36 all out' Test. A recent Shield game between South Australia and Western Australia saw the quicks call the shots. ""The preparation is the same,"" Hough said. Pacers have picked up 106 of the 134 wickets to fall in the day-night Tests here, with spinners picking up 28.In fact, spin could even come into play later on, according to Hough, because of the 30% clay content, which tends to break up. ""Also, if you don't get a new ball under lights and you have set batters out there, you could see through the night-time period,"" he said.""It's a pretty standard wicket,"" lamented Australia's star spinner Nathan Lyon . ""I didn't expect this from Damian. We're going to challenge the defence for a long period of time. I really enjoy bowling here, with the spin and the bounce. Red ball, pink ball, white ball, definitely my favourite ground. It's a great venue to bowl spin. If you're good with the bat, you'll score runs."" KL Rahul , for one, wasn't so sure about that. ""The ball seems a bit harder than the red ball. While fielding, you can feel the ball hit your hands a lot quicker and harder. Same while batting. It seems to get to you much quicker and seams around a bit more than the red ball. There'll be a lot of seam movement. Picking the ball from the hand can be tricky.""There are also thunderstorms predicted on the opening day, adding to the great unknowns of the pink-ball contest.","Adelaide Oval curator Damian Hough says drop-in pitches are 'challenging' Only six of the 22 pink-ball Tests played have lasted the full distance of five days. Seven have ended within four days, seven within three days and two games within two days.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115989664,imgsize-159040,width-400,resizemode-4/115989664.jpg"

India's eternal floater doesn't worry about his batting position anymore. Make him open or slot him in the middle,

's ready to roll. Australia is where it all began for him, all he needs now is a chance to contribute...

KL Rahul Press Conference ahead of 2nd Test

ADELAIDE: As Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal sweated it out under the blazing South Australian sun, batting as a pair in the pace nets, a composed KL Rahul took fresh guard against the sidearm throwers alongside. Minutes earlier, Rahul had been reminiscing about Australia being the place where it all began for him as a Test opener.Back on the 2014-15 tour - made famous by Virat Kohli 's twin Adelaide tons and MS Dhoni's shock retirement from the format - the then-22-year-old Rahul's Test debut in Melbourne had been a forgettable one.He was slotted in at No. 6 first up and managed three off eight balls, falling to a streaky attempt at slog sweeping Nathan Lyon and managing only a top edge. In his second dig he was pushed up to No. 3 and fell in equally horrifying fashion, another top edge to a short one from Mitchell Johnson costing him his wicket. Luckily, by the next Test in Sydney, his nerves had started to settle.Pushed up to open, Rahul came up with a composed 262-ball 110, keeping the demons at bay with discipline and verve to announce his arrival. And this has been his rollercoaster story ever since, with crests following troughs and long absences in-between some stellar performances, especially away from home in challenging conditions.Even a decade on, he remains the eternal floater in India's batting order, with even the disciplined and match-winning contribution in Perth in the first Test of this series offering no guarantee of a settled spot.""Luckily for me, I've batted in different positions. Early on, it was a bit of a challenge mentally, how to play those first 20-25 balls. Not so much technique, but what shots to play, how early I can attack, how cautious I need to be.Those were a bit tricky early on. But now that I've played in ODIs, Tests and all over the place, it's given me a little bit of an idea how I need to manage my innings. It's the start that's important, whether I'm batting at the top or middle. The first 30-40 balls. If I can manage that, everything else starts to seem like regular batting.""Ten years ago, it was my first Test series. It was a bit surreal. There was a lot going on in my head. I've learnt a lot. I'm looking forward to the next 10 years and Australia is where it all started for me,"" Rahul said.In India's remarkable Perth win a few days ago, Rahul - opening for the first time since Feb 2023 - chewed up 74 balls as India collapsed for 150 in 298 balls in their first innings. He then stayed put for 176 balls in a 201-run opening stand as Jaiswal scored 161.""I was told quite early (to open). I missed out in the New Zealand series, so I was told to be ready. I had enough time to prepare. I've batted enough at the top of the order and know what processes I need to follow,"" Rahul said.However, with captain Rohit back and No. 3 Shubman Gill having recovered from his finger injury, could Rahul be shoved down the order again? If yes, it's only to be expected, since Rohit has ruled the opening slot since 2019. If not, it may well be the start of a fresh chapter again in Australia.""This is my first pink-ball Test , so I'll try and face up to whatever comes my way,"" he said. ""I just want to go out there, bat and play for the team. I just want to be in the playing XI. Fit me in wherever.""The person holding the key is captain Rohit, who batted at No. 4 in the practice game in Canberra, keeping Jaiswal and Rahul's opening slots intact. So maybe Rahul has been told where he'll bat? The answer was equivocal. ""I've been told, but I've also been told not to share it. You'll have to wait for Day One or maybe when the captain comes here tomorrow.""","KL Rahul says Australia is where it all began for him as a Test opener. India's eternal floater doesn't worry about his batting position anymore. Make him open or slot him in the middle, he's ready to roll. The person holding the key is captain Rohit Sharma, who batted at No. 4 in Canberra.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115989310,imgsize-53920,width-400,resizemode-4/115989310.jpg"

Pakistan's wrist spinner, Sufiyan Muqeem , led his team to a resounding 10-wicket victory against Zimbabwe in the second T20I at Bulawayo, securing the series win.

They had initially started promisingly.The 25-year-old’s remarkable figures are now the best ever recorded by a Pakistan bowler in T20I cricket.

Should India continue with KL Rahul-Yashasvi Jaiswal as openers?

NEW DELHI: India captain Rohit Sharma will return to lead the side in the second Test against Australia at Adelaide Oval starting Friday after missing the first match to spend time with his family for the birth of his second child.Following a strong opening partnership between KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal in the first innings of the first Test, the return of Rohit presents a selection dilemma for the team management. Will they stick with the Rahul-Jaiswal combination for the opening slot, or will Rahul make way for Rohit to open alongside Jaiswal?Former India head coach Ravi Shastri expressed his opinion on the matter saying the decision lies with Rohit, whether he chooses to open the batting or move to the middle order.Speaking on the ICC Review, Shastri highlighted the significance of Rohit's experience, noting that it could be a game-changer for India as they aim to take a 2-0 lead against an Australian side eager to level the series.""It's a fantastic boost because there's no doubting his quality,"" Shastri said. ""He's very experienced. You need that experience in the middle order.""Rohit started his Test career in the middle order before transitioning to an opening role. In 41 innings at No. 5 or lower, he has scored 1,474 runs at an average of 43.35, including nine half-centuries and three centuries.While his best performances in the middle order have been at home, where he boasts an impressive average of 96.12, his record in Australia has been more modest. Rohit has managed 187 runs in seven innings at an average of 26.71, including a vital half-century in Melbourne during the 2018/19 series.""It""s the right mix of experience and youth in the setup, so whether he opens the batting or goes in the middle order, the choice is his,"" Shastri said.""He's experienced enough to see where he's most dangerous when it comes to Australia. Where would Australia not like to see him? That's the position he should choose. And he's the leader of the pack, so he can afford to do that.""Shastri also pointed out KL Rahul's good form, highlighting his crucial 77 in the second innings in Perth, as another reason why Rohit should consider batting lower down the order.""I think he (Rahul) should carry on (opening) because Rohit has not had much time since he's come here (Australia),"" Shastri said.""Very quickly he had to play that Prime Minister's XI game.

What India need to do to qualify for World Test Championship final

England Test captain Ben Stokes voiced his concerns regarding the International Cricket Council 's communication with players about over-rate penalties. He believes the ICC should review its over-rate regulations for the World Test Championship .This follows penalties imposed on both England and New Zealand after the first Test match between the two sides. The match concluded within four days, yet both teams faced sanctions for slow over-rates.Each team lost three World Test Championship points. Players from both sides also received fines equivalent to 15% of their match fees.New Zealand's penalty dropped them from fourth to fifth place in the WTC standings. England's cumulative over-rate penalties in the current WTC cycle now total 22 points. Nineteen of those penalty points were incurred during the 2023 Ashes series.""The most frustrating thing, from both teams' points of view, is that the game finished early, there was a result. But I think the frustration actually stems back to last year in the Ashes where it was the first time I really brought it up to the match referee and the umpires,"" said Stokes. ""I guess the most frustrating thing is that it's always an issue depending on where you are in the world and the style of cricket that's played. There's never an over-rate issue in Asia because of how much spin is played.""There's so many tactical decisions that you need to make, whether that be chatting with the bowler or field changes. As a captain, I like to change things quite a lot and the field could be completely different six balls in an over. But that's not taken into consideration. And getting told to just 'hurry up' isn't going to fix it, because we're out there playing a game. The times and the rules are the same wherever you go in the world. From a player's point of view - and I'm not the only one who shares this opinion - we would like to have a lot more communication with the ICC around this,"" opined Stokes.Stokes was particularly upset by the non-response from the ICC. He clarified he hadn't signed the over-rate chargesheet since the Lord's Test during the Ashes as a form of protest until he heard from the ICC, although he and New Zealand captain Tom Latham did accept the charges levelled against them in Christchurch.""The two conversations I've had with the match referees have actually been very good and the match referees have handled it very, very well and been very understanding from a player's point of view. But it's been over a year now since I made some comments around the over rates and still to this day we're yet to hear any response back from anyone at the ICC around that,"" he said.""I've not signed an over-rate sheet since Lord's in the Ashes just until we hear some communication back from the ICC that we're still waiting for. Captains have to sign over-rate sheets and fines and stuff, but I have said 'no' until I have the conversations. But they still take the fines off you anyway,"" lamented Stokes.",England captain Ben Stokes has voiced his concerns about over-rate penalties.

What India need to do to qualify for World Test Championship final

Australia's premier spin bowler Nathan Lyon expressed confidence in Mitchell Marsh 's bowling fitness for the second Test against India. However, Lyon also stated his willingness to bowl extra overs if needed.Marsh's fitness has been a concern for Australia leading up to the pink-ball Test, starting Friday. He experienced discomfort after bowling nearly 20 overs in the first Test loss to India.Australia added uncapped all-rounder Beau Webster to the squad as cover. However, it appears Marsh will likely retain his place in the playing eleven.""I honestly think we'll see Mitch Marsh bowl,"" Lyon told reporters on Wednesday.Lyon isn't worried about Marsh's fitness. He praised Marsh's performance since returning to the team, particularly his dominant display during the Ashes series in England.""I'm not concerned about Bison's fitness if I'm being honest. He's been brilliant for us since he's come back in. He came back in that game in Leeds during the Ashes and has really dominated, so got full confidence in Bison. Happy to bowl his overs.""Lyon is accustomed to bowling alongside all-rounders like Mitchell Marsh and Cameron Green , or even both. He has also led the bowling attack when Australia opts for four specialist bowlers, with part-time support from the top order.Even without a dedicated all-rounder, Lyon regularly bowls extended spells, especially when he's the only spinner in a four-man attack. He understands his role within the team and is prepared to bowl more overs if required.""I'm very clear on my role within the team. Nothing really changes with me…if I can get the opportunity to bowl more overs, I'll jump at it,"" he said.Lyon had a quiet first Test but anticipates spinners playing a bigger role in the second Test at the Adelaide Oval. He boasts an impressive record at the venue, with 63 wickets at an average of 25.26 in 13 matches, including seven day-night games.Lyon considers the Adelaide Oval an excellent venue for spinners. He praised the head curator, Damien Hough, for preparing a balanced pitch that challenges both batsmen and bowlers.""I think it's a great, great venue to play spinner. And I think what Damien (head curator) does here is he produces a great wicket that got enough in it, and it's challenging for both bat and ball.""Lyon believes the Adelaide Oval pitch offers opportunities for both batsmen and bowlers to excel. He considers it one of the best cricket wickets globally and anticipates it being conducive to spin bowling.""If you are good enough with the bat, your score runs. If you good enough for the ball, you'll hopefully create a few chances along your way. This is probably the best cricket wicket in the world, if I'm being honest with you. So I'm expecting it to be pretty helpful to spin bowling as well.""Australia suffered a heavy defeat in the first Test in Perth, trailing 0-1 in the five-match series. Lyon, however, expects Australia to rebound.He acknowledged that Australia didn't perform well in Perth and that India comprehensively outplayed them. He also found the intense reactions following the loss somewhat amusing, considering it's a five-match series.""We've had a chance to reflect and we understand that we didn't play our best period in Perth and India, totally our player played us. But with all the other stuff, it's been quite humorous, in a way, looking at how much has been said and the reactions of so many different people after one loss, the beauty of a five test match test series, is we get the opportunity to turn that around.""Lyon emphasized the opportunity to reverse their fortunes in the remaining Test matches. He recognizes India's strong performance in Perth but views it as a chance for Australia to bounce back.""That's the challenge of what we face right now, obviously, coming up against a world class India side that played exceptional game of cricket in Perth, but that's been nine days ago now or so.""","Australia's premier spin bowler Nathan Lyon expressed confidence in Mitchell Marsh's bowling fitness for the second Test against India.

NEW DELHI: England have retained Ollie Pope as their wicket-keeper for the second Test against New Zealand , maintaining an unchanged lineup after Jordan Cox's thumb injury during practice.Following Cox's injury setback, Pope will continue his wicket-keeping responsibilities despite Ollie Robinson 's arrival in New Zealand as a potential replacement. The team management has shown confidence in Pope's abilities behind the stumps.Pope, who normally plays as a middle-order batter, previously kept wickets when Ben Foakes was unwell in 2022.

Jacob Bethell , who impressed with an unbeaten half-century on his debut during England's eight-wicket victory against New Zealand in Christchurch, has secured a two-year central contract. This contract will be valid until September 2026.Bethell made his white-ball debut in September and recently signed an IPL 2025 contract with Royal Challengers Bengaluru . He was also granted a development contract last month.The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) also announced contract extensions for several seamers. Jofra Archer , Brydon Carse, and Matthew Potts have all extended their contracts until September 2026. Carse notably took ten wickets in the Christchurch match.Archer's contract extension is particularly noteworthy given his absence from Test cricket since February 2021. He has cautiously returned to white-ball cricket for England this year following a prolonged period of elbow and back injuries.Archer's initial two-year contract was due to expire in October 2025. This extension ensures his continued involvement with England cricket. He also secured an IPL 2025 deal with the Rajasthan Royals . This suggests he's being considered for England's upcoming Test series against India next year and the Ashes in Australia.England Test captain Ben Stokes has indicated Archer is contemplating a return to Test cricket. The 29-year-old fast bowler is reportedly interested in participating in the one-off Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge, scheduled to begin on May 22.""Jof is a man of few words, even over WhatsApp. I had one a couple of months ago saying ‘Zimbabwe?’. That shows he is very interested in playing Test cricket for England. The excitement is understandable around Jofra. The best thing is he is back on the field playing.”Stokes acknowledges the enthusiasm surrounding Archer's potential return. He emphasizes the significance of Archer's return to the field after overcoming injuries that could have ended his career.""I am sure he thought he might not have the chance to put on an England shirt again – the injuries and surgeries he has gone through could have ended other people’s career – so there is no rushing back. He is being handled very well by the ECB and that will certainly continue. There is no doubt he is going so well at the moment it is a case of having to build the body up to handle extra pressure of Test match cricket,” he said to reporters.Stokes highlighted the careful management of Archer's return by the ECB. The focus is on building his physical capacity to handle the demands of Test cricket.Stokes believes Archer's Test comeback hinges on his ability to manage the physical strain of the longer format. This involves adjusting his bowling workload to the specific requirements of Test matches.""When the decision gets made between him and the people who make those decisions around players, I am sure there will be conversations that he will have to get some different loading.""Stokes explained that one-day matches allow for shorter, more distributed bowling spells. However, Test cricket requires sustained bowling effort over extended periods and across multiple days. This requires specific conditioning and load management.","Jacob Bethell signs two-year central contract with England. Jofra Archer, Brydon Carse, and Matthew Potts have all extended their contracts.

KL Rahul Press Conference ahead of 2nd Test

How a change in batting position could well help Rohit Sharma in Tests

NEW DELHI: Prior to the day-night Test , Australia 's premier spinner Nathan Lyon has praised the Adelaide Oval pitch, describing it as the 'best cricket wicket in the world' while anticipating significant spin.As Australia prepare to challenge India in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy series, Lyon aims to utilise the Adelaide conditions effectively.Australia, with their impressive record of 11 victories and a single defeat in pink-ball Tests, are keen to bounce back following their 295-run defeat at Perth.Lyon expressed his fondness for Adelaide as his preferred venue, noting its suitability for all types of cricket.""I love Adelaide. Adelaide's my favourite venue. So I love playing cricket here. I think the whole atmosphere here with the crowds, the whole town, the whole city and then with the pitch here and the conditions here, I really enjoy bowling here for the spin and bounce. So red ball, pink ball, white ball. I just love playing cricket here,"" Lyon said at the pre-match presser.""Red ball, white ball, pink ball, it is exactly the same. Not overly challenging. I think it is a great venue to play spin. I think what Damien (Hough, head curator) does here is he produces a great wicket that has got enough in it and it is challenging for both bat and ball.""""If you are good enough with the bat, you will score runs. If you are good enough with the ball, you will hopefully create a few chances along your way. So I think this is probably the best cricket wicket in the world, if I am being honest with you. So I am expecting it to be pretty helpful for spin and bowling as well,"" Lyon added.Regarding Josh Hazlewood 's absence due to a side strain, Lyon commented on his teammate's rehabilitation progress and praised his team spirit.""Yeah, he is pretty disappointed. The other day when he told me, about four or five days ago now, that he had a little side issue. But the quality of person that Josh is, he is getting around everyone, making sure that everyone is right here firstly, but he is also doing his rehab and training ball. You have seen him do his training tonight and I think he did about a 90-minute rehab session yesterday,"" he added.The Adelaide Test, commencing December 6, sees India in a strong position following their commanding performance in the first Test, led by Jasprit Bumrah 's bowling and leadership.Nevertheless, India must overcome the memories of their 2020 Adelaide pink-ball Test performance, where they recorded their lowest Test score of 36 runs. In that match, Pat Cummins (4/21) and Josh Hazlewood (5/8) dominated the Indian batting order, setting up an easy 90-run chase for Australia.","Nathan Lyon describes Adelaide Oval pitch as 'best cricket wicket in the world' Australia's premier spinner anticipates significant spin on the pitch.

NEW DELHI: Speaking about Rishabh Pant 's game-winning 89 not out against Australia at the Gabba during the 2020-21 Border-Gavaskar Trophy series, former India head coach Rahul Dravid suggested that the wicketkeeper batsman has ""taken to Test cricket like a duck to water"" and described his performance in the red-ball format as ""sensational.""On the last day of the fourth and final Test, when India was chasing an intimidating score of 328, Pant had his magnificent effort. In addition to securing a historic 3-wicket victory, his counterattacking approach also broke Australia's 32-year unbeaten streak at the Gabba, giving India a 2-1 series win.""I think Rishabh's was an incredible performance. Watching Rishabh there and chasing to get 89 to win that Test match at the Gabba, with everything on the line and such a depleted side, to put in that kind of performance under that kind of pressure-truly sensational,"" Dravid said to Star Sports.In eight Test matches against Australia, Pant has scored 662 runs at an average of 55.16, including two fifties and a hundred. Notably, he cemented his reputation as a match-winner by helping India win the Border Gavaskar Trophy during the 2018-19 and 2020-21 tours.""What a special cricketer he's been. He's just taken to Test cricket like a duck to water. It's just phenomenal. I mean, it's hard to imagine that, after Dhoni left, you felt there might be some time for someone to come in and replace him. I'm not saying he's replaced him, but certainly in Test cricket, his performances have been absolutely sensational,"" Dravid added.In addition, Dravid responded to the fact that his double century at the 2003-04 Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Adelaide is still a fan favorite despite a number of outstanding performances by Indian batsmen in Australia over the years.India were struggling at 85/4 in the second Test of the series after the Australians scored 556 runs when VVS Laxman came out to join Dravid at the crease. Dravid played a knock of 233 runs as part of the duo's 303-run partnership for the fifth wicket.""I'm grateful for it, but I wouldn't have voted for myself, put it that way. Probably I've got a lot of recency bias as well. I think the way India has performed in Australia over the last two series in particular-winning series there-that counts for a lot. However great my performances were or India's performances were, we couldn't actually win that series.""We came close, but we couldn't get the wickets on the final day in Sydney that we needed. The last two teams that have gone to Australia have done that, and that's a fantastic achievement-a terrific achievement-and there have been some absolutely sensational performances right through those. I don't know which of those made your list, but some absolutely sensational performances in the last two series as well,"" said Dravid.As India chased down a 230-run target to win the match by 4 wickets and take a 1-0 series lead against Australia in Australia for the first time ever, the batting icon followed up his incredible first innings performance with an undefeated 72-run knock in the second innings.Reflecting on batting with Laxman, Dravid shared, ""I was thinking, 'I've got the captain run out. I better do something meaningful.' It was totally my mistake getting Sourav (Ganguly) run out. I will own up to that one-it was my mistake. But I think you're just trying to bat, you're just trying to build a partnership, you're just trying to get to the target. 556 is a huge score. You're just trying to stitch together a partnership; we've lost four wickets, and you're just trying to think about getting close and batting together.""The thing with Laxman and me is that we had batted together a couple of really big partnerships before that. We did it once in Kolkata in 2001 and even in a domestic game when we first played South Zone against West Zone-we had a really big partnership. So we had kind of batted a lot together and built this partnership. Not that we were thinking about that when we got out there, but I think the idea was really just to bat and try and build partnerships, stitch something together.""As the partnership grew, the wicket was a pretty good one to bat on, the ball got a bit softer, and runs started flowing a lot easier. It's always nice batting with Laxman as well, right? Because he's just a beautiful player to watch and such a lovely player. He really attacked back, which, in some ways, complemented me quite well in how we went about our innings,"" Dravid recalled.","Rishabh Pant has ""taken to Test cricket like a duck to water,"" says Rahul Dravid.

Aston Villa and Everton bounce back

Liverpool's position at the Premier League summit was weakened as a dramatic 3-3 draw at Newcastle on Wednesday saw their lead reduced to seven points. Late drama at St James' Park denied Liverpool an eighth consecutive win as Fabian Schar capitalized on a rare error by goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher in the 90th minute. Mohamed Salah , in electric form, scored twice in the second half, taking his season tally to 15 goals. The Egyptian superstar converted two Trent Alexander-Arnold assists, overturning Newcastle’s 2-1 advantage after Curtis Jones had earlier equalized Alexander Isak's opener. Anthony Gordon briefly restored Newcastle’s lead before Salah’s strikes.Despite dominating stretches of the game, Liverpool faltered late. Manager Arne Slot defended Kelleher, stating, ""He has done remarkably well for us. Unfortunately, he misjudged the situation.""Arsenal moved level on points with Chelsea , taking third place on goal difference after a 2-0 victory over Manchester United . Set-pieces proved crucial, with Jurrien Timber heading home Declan Rice’s corner and William Saliba deflecting Thomas Partey’s header into the net from a Bukayo Saka delivery.Manager Mikel Arteta praised the team's energy, saying, ""It’s a joy to play in this stadium with that energy.""

The league leaders had secured just one point in three matches before Tuesday.Barcelona now lead the standings with 37 points, maintaining a four-point advantage over Real Madrid, who have two matches remaining. Atletico Madrid hold third position with 32 points.""We knew how important it was to win again,"" Raphinha told Movistar Plus. ""In the last three games something has been missing.

The sequence began when Johan Mojica's clearance struck his teammate, with the ball falling to Torres, who finished by shooting between the goalkeeper's legs.Barca created a few chances in a slow-paced first half and Mallorca striker Vedat Muriqi levelled the scoring from a quick counter attack just before the break.Yet Barca came out flying in the second half and Raphinha, who almost scored from a free-kick minutes earlier, restored their lead from the penalty spot in the 56th minute after Yamal was fouled inside the box.Yamal crossed to Raphinha to extend Barca's lead with a tap-in in the 74th minute and substitutes Frenkie De Jong and Pau Victor added to the goal-feast with late strikes from inside the box to wrap up an easy win.",Raphinha scores twice as Barcelona beat Mallorca 5-1.

NEW DELHI: A tragic stampede at a football stadium in southern Guinea resulted in 56 fatalities and numerous injuries following fan clashes, as announced by the Guinean government on Monday.The government has initiated an investigation to identify those responsible for the Sunday incident, according to Communications Minister Fana Soumah 's televised statement.Local media and political groups reported that children were among those who lost their lives, reported news agency AP.The incident occurred on Sunday afternoon at Nzerekore stadium during a local tournament final between Labe and Nzerekore teams, organised to honour military leader Mamadi Doumbouya , as stated by Prime Minister Amadou Oury Bah on X.Bah confirmed casualties without providing specifics, noting that regional authorities were working to stabilise the situation.According to local reports, security forces deployed tear gas to control the chaos that erupted after a contested penalty decision.Media Guinea reported that the disputed penalty sparked supporter outrage, leading to stone-throwing and subsequent tear gas deployment by security forces. The outlet noted that children were among the deceased, with several critically injured victims receiving treatment at a regional hospital.Video footage from the venue showed supporters protesting referee decisions before conflicts erupted, with spectators spilling onto the pitch.The recordings captured people fleeing the stadium, with many scaling the high perimeter fence.Additional footage showed numerous casualties on a hospital floor surrounded by people providing assistance to the wounded.The National Alliance for Alternation and Democracy opposition group demanded an inquiry, criticising the tournament as a vehicle for promoting the military leader's ""illegal and inappropriate"" political aspirations.Guinea has been under military governance since the 2021 coup that removed President Alpha Conde. It joins other West African nations, including Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, where military takeovers have delayed civilian rule restoration.Doumbouya, who led the coup three years ago, claimed to prevent national chaos and criticised the previous administration's unfulfilled promises, though he faces criticism for not meeting public expectations.","A tragic stampede at a football stadium in southern Guinea resulted in 56 fatalities and numerous injuries.

Clashes erupted at a football match in N'Zerekore , Guinea , on Sunday, leaving many dead.According to hospital sources quoted by AFP, ""There are bodies lined up as far as the eye can see in the hospital. Others are lying on the floor in the hallways. The morgue is full.""""There are around 100 dead"", said one doctor, while another said there were ""dozens of dead"".According to witnesses, the anger was fueled by a referee's decision that was contested, after which the fans invaded the pitch and later also set the N'Zerekore police station on fire.Media reports indicated that the game was organised as part of a tournament dedicated to Guinea's current president and junta chief, Mamadi Doumbouya , who took control through a coup in 2021.In Guinea, these tournaments have become increasingly prevalent as Doumbouya appears to be positioning himself for the anticipated presidential elections next year, whilst political alignments continue to develop.In September 2021, Doumbouya, then serving as a colonel, led a successful coup against President Alpha Conde. Ironically, Conde had previously appointed Doumbouya to lead an elite unit responsible for protecting the president from such takeovers.Despite international demands and his initial commitment to transfer authority to civilian leadership by December 2024, Doumbouya has since reversed his stance and indicated he will retain power.","Clashes erupted at a football match in N'Zerekore, Guinea, on Sunday, leaving many dead.

'Good attitude again'

MADRID: Spanish champions Real Madrid beat Getafe 2-0 to move second in La Liga on Sunday with Kylian Mbappe finding the net after a difficult week.The French striker has been criticised in recent weeks for his form but after Jude Bellingham opened the scoring from the penalty spot, Mbappe slotted home a well-taken second.Later, Mbappe wasted three other big chances but Madrid were able to move within one point of league leaders Barcelona, who lost on Saturday at home against Las Palmas.Carlo Ancelotti's side have played one fewer game than the Catalans, and Atletico Madrid, third, who are one point behind.""(Mbappe) played very well, he was active, dangerous as always,"" said Ancelotti. ""He scored an important goal, he created chances in the second half and had a very active game, it's what we want from him.""Mbappe, playing in his favoured role on the left with Vinicius Junior out injured, was offered plenty of support by Madrid's fans.""The fans understand more than anyone what moment the team is in, and the players (are in),"" added Ancelotti.Getafe set out to slow the game down and they largely succeeded until Allan Nyom tugged down Antonio Rudiger in the area after half an hour.After Mbappe missed his penalty against Liverpool in the Champions League defeat at Anfield on Wednesday, Bellingham stepped up to take the spot-kick.The England international outfoxed David Soria to send Madrid ahead on the half-hour with his third goal in three league games.""Today Bellingham or Mbappe had to choose (who took the penalty), they both chose Bellingham,"" said Ancelotti.Mbappe doubled his team's lead with a superb strike seven minutes prior to the break, after Bellingham spread the ball out to him on the left flank.The France captain drove inside and curled home a low effort inside the far post for his eighth league goal of the season.Ancelotti took off Bellingham at half-time because of an apparent knock sustained in a collision with Soria, but later said he thought the midfielder would recover quickly.Mbappe produced a glorious chipped pass to put Brahim Diaz in behind early in the second period, but the Morocco international's effort sailed narrowly over the crossbar.The forward came millimetres away from scoring a second himself but after rounding Soria squeezed a shot just wide of the far post.Soria made a good save to deny Fede Valverde as Getafe battled to keep the scoreline respectable.Mbappe spurned another chance to score when he fired off-target after being played in again, but Getafe could not capitalise on his profligacy.John Patrick had the visitors' best chance with a powerful effort which hit the crossbar then the post.Mbappe had another chance in stoppage time but misfired from close range as his anxiety to prove his worth in a Madrid shirt following his summer move from Paris Saint-Germain continued to tell, despite his goal.Madrid face Athletic Bilbao in midweek, hoping to build on their run of three consecutive La Liga wins.""We've had a lot of injuries (but) we are there fighting, battling,"" said Ancelotti.

Malaga: World number one Jannik Sinner was described as a ""puzzle that not many have solved"" after defeating Alex de Minaur to power holders Italy into the Davis Cup final with a 2-0 victory over Australia on Saturday.The two-time winners will face Netherlands in Sunday's showpiece after the Dutch ousted Germany 2-0 on Friday to make the final for the first time in 104 years of trying.Sinner, who has never lost against De Minaur in nine matches including last year's Davis Cup final, triumphed 6-3, 6-4 in Malaga.In the first singles rubber Matteo Berrettini earned a 6-7 (6/8), 6-3, 7-5 win over Australia's Thanasi Kokkinakis in two hours 46 minutes.""Finals are a huge privilege to be a part of -- Sunday is a final and I'm very happy to be here in this position,"" said Sinner.""Winning would mean so much for us, not only for the win but because it would mean we defended our title.""If we don't, it's still an amazing achievement, we showed it was not lucky last year, we're here because we are an amazing team.""Australia, beaten finalists in each of the last two years, are the second most successful team in the tournament's history with 28 titles but last won it in 2003.Australian Open, US Open and ATP Finals winner Sinner is enjoying a superb year and can cap it with another Davis Cup triumph.The 23-year-old is still waiting for the outcome of the World Anti-Doping Agency's appeal against his initial exoneration for twice testing positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.However he has not been distracted and despite De Minaur, ranked ninth, battling hard, claimed the first set without much stress.The players exchanged breaks in the second and third games before Sinner broke decisively for a 4-2 lead with a delicious drop shot, and he served it out.The Italian worked the first break points of the second set in the ninth game. De Minaur saved two but Sinner converted the third with a passing shot to serve for the match.Sinner claimed victory when De Minaur returned badly wide and mangled his racquet in sheer frustration.""He hasn't won a million matches this year for no reason -- it was tough,"" admitted De Minaur.""It's like trying to solve a puzzle that not a lot of people have managed to solve.""His ball speed, his consistency, it feels like there's no real let down of focus throughout the whole match.""Berrettini was superb in the doubles decider as Italy beat Argentina in the quarter-finals and captain Filippo Volandri rewarded him with selection in the opening clash in place of Lorenzo Musetti.Berrettini watched on as Italy won the Davis Cup for the first time in 47 years in 2023, not part of the squad but cheering from the sidelines as he recovered from an ankle injury.This year he has been able to play an important role in Italy's charge towards the final.""After I lost the first set it wasn't easy to digest that, but when I'm fighting for my country with this crowd... I kept on fighting,"" said Berrettini.Kokkinakis clung on to take the first set to a tie-break which he shaded.Berrettini claimed the second with a break in the eighth game, which he served out.Kokkinakis survived two break points in the first game of the third set and no others emerged in an even battle until the 11th game when he conceded two more.Berrettini capitalised on the first and clinched the set with an ace to delight thousands of Italian supporters at the Martin Carpena arena.""I felt I was playing an away tie, it was tough on Australia -- we were playing in Spain but I thought we were in Italy,"" said Kokkinakis, echoing prior Australian complaints about the revamped Davis Cup format.""Once again we're a long way from Australia aren't we?"" said captain Lleyton Hewitt.""It will be nice when they take our bid seriously to host the finals, Australia will put on a bloody good event.""",Italy beat Australia 2-0 in Davis Cup final in Malaga.

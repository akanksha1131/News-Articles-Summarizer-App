(Screengrabs)

Anish Giri has taken potshots at Hikaru Nakamura and Ian Nepomniachtchi following their feud, which began at the FIDE World Rapid and Blitz Team event earlier this month in London.""I'm getting very disturbed whenever Nepo is brought up. I'm like, how did everybody come on time and you didn't?"" Giri told Take Take Take.""I think it was more of a heat-of-the-moment situation. Again, I felt that it was unjust what was happening. Not even what was happening, but the fact that they just finished the match,"" he added.The controversy began when WR Chess lost the first match of their two-game quarter-final against Germany and Friends. The team protested, arguing they hadn’t been officially notified of the start time, causing their players to arrive late. Alireza Firouzja showed up 15 seconds late for his three-minute game, while Ian Nepomniachtchi had only 1 minute and 4 seconds left on his clock, and Hikaru Nakamura just 38 seconds. All three lost their games as a result.After lengthy discussions, the organizers permitted the teams to replay the first match.""They lost. Are they going to play again? And intuitively, I feel that their chances of winning the match are, like, massive. And then I realized, well, that's because, you know, they're taking two shots. And they shouldn't have taken the first shot.""Of course, I understand it all happened in the moment. But I just didn't like the notion of all of them sitting there entitled.""And I'm like, yeah, how did everybody come on time and you didn't? Like, you know? They saw the entitlement, like, yeah, how did it even happen? Like, you know, I didn't really like the way it went. And the fact that nobody was fighting for the other team,"" he added.Nepo, in response, had thrown comments like: ""Big expert in law, Anish. Since when?"" and ""Next FIDE president"" at the Dutch GM.""Anish seems so smart, but whenever he opens his mouth… it's already questionable,"" said Nepo.""Why does he care so much?"" Nakamura had asked.When coaxed about Ian Nepomniachtchi and Nakamura gossiping about him, the World No. 10 said: ""If Ian and Hikaru are able to sit alongside each other and gossip about me, you know, then me and Ian will surely be fine as well. Because these two, like, they have so much bad blood. I mean, like, it is so bad for so many years.""""And they've had so many incidents that if they managed to overcome it, me and Ian will manage to overcome it as well. I'm not confrontational until I feel that there's been injustice. And when I feel that there's been injustice, it kind of triggers me.""I've had these issues with Magnus as well. Like, I'm ready to be his best friend.""But I felt that he's done something which was not just somehow an unfairness of a situation. It just triggers something in me. I don't know why that is. Otherwise, I'm very peaceful.""",Anish Giri has taken potshots at Hikaru Nakamura and Ian Nepomniachtchi. The feud began at the FIDE World Rapid and Blitz Team event earlier this month in London.

Poll Who should India prioritise for the next Test? Jasprit Bumrah for his pace and impact Kuldeep Yadav for variety in spin attack

Bumrah & Gambhir Locked In! What’s Cooking at Edgbaston?

England fast bowler Mark Wood , who is out of the five-match series against India due to injury, has warned Shubman Gill and Gautam Gambhir ahead of the Edgbaston Test, starting on Wednesday.""They cannot afford to go 2-0 down. So you want your best bowler,"" Wood said on the Sky Sports podcast.""There's no way he's saying, 'I'm not playing at Lord's.' I don't think so. I think he'll want to play both games,"" predicted Wood.""Even if, let's just say, India win the next one and it's 1-1, I still think they'll want him to make the difference, to get them ahead. I think every overseas bowler wants to get on that board, and he'll be the same,"" he added.Former England captain Michael Atherton echoed Wood's view that Bumrah would love to play the third Test at Lord's, but at the same time said India must play left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav ""They have got a decision to make over Bumrah, first of all, because every overseas player wants to play in a Lord's Test,"" said Atherton.""The Lord's Test is three days after Edgbaston.""In cricketing terms, he should certainly play at Edgbaston, and I'd think very carefully about Old Trafford, because that's the kind of ground where pace and reverse swing are really important. But as you say, every cricketer wants to play at Lord's and get on that honours board.""I do think they should play Kuldeep Yadav.

Poll Should Jasprit Bumrah be rested for the Edgbaston Test? Yes, to manage workload No, he should play

Edgbaston Preview | Yashasvi Jaiswal faces the brunt, exits slip cordon

Bumrah & Gambhir in Deep Chat at Edgbaston Nets | Tactical Talks Before 2nd Test?

Two closed-door practice sessions meant there was no opportunity to see how the Indian cricket team worked on their fielding, specifically after the Leeds Test, where there were far too many drops that cost Shubman Gill and Co. dearly.With the gates opening on Monday and India resuming business after a rest day, all eyes were on what fielding coach T Dilip did with the unit. The usual ground fielding started the session, but it was the catching drill, and the unique start to it, that caught everyone's attention.Dilip placed a black cloth on a makeshift stand and fired catches from the little opening underneath it to test the fielders' reflexes. The slip-catching was next, and there was a tweak in the slip cordon, which also dropped major hints, later confirmed by assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate, about the playing XI.Karun Nair at first slip, KL Rahul at second slip, and Shubman Gill at third slip were the usual suspects, and there was a swap of sorts as Sai Sudharsan and Nitish Kumar Reddy featured in the fourth slip and gully positions, while Yashasvi Jaiswal was asked to do drills for the short-leg and silly point positions.Two things were clear with this arrangement: Nitish Kumar Reddy is in the playing XI mix, and extra attention on close-in catching means the spin department is set to be beefed up for the Edgbaston Test starting Wednesday. It has been very hot and dry for the last few days, and ten Doeschate confirmed at the presser that the wicket, which has some grass right now to hold the surface together, is very dry underneath. The Indian camp confirmed playing two spinners on this surface but didn't reveal which two out of Ravindra Jadeja Washington Sundar , and Kuldeep Yadav will feature in the playing XI.""There is a very strong chance of playing two spinners. It's just which two we play. And that goes back to the previous question about juggling the batting depth. All three spinners are bowling very nicely. Washi (Sundar) is batting very nicely. So it's just which combination we go with. All-rounder spinner or the out-and-out spinner. Then obviously you have to play the bowling all-rounder again. So there are so many different variables. The wicket's got 11 mls (grass) on at the moment.""11 or 12, I can't remember which of the two. But it's quite grassy and patchy. It's quite dry underneath. But there's also rain forecast for Wednesday. So again, trying to weigh up the two options of how we want to go attacking-wise. But I'm pretty sure two spinners will play,"" says ten Doeschate.The suspense around Jasprit Bumrah continues, and while he is ""ready to play,"" the management will take the call at the very last moment. There is a possibility of him sitting out this fixture to manage his workload for the remainder of the series, and the remaining pieces of the playing XI puzzle will only fall in place when the think tank gets absolute clarity on Bumrah and then decides on the balancing act between 20 wickets and batting depth.If Bumrah doesn't play, the primary focus has to be putting a bowling attack in place which can pick 20 wickets for you. Both head coach Gambhir and captain Gill have emphasised that, and now is the time to walk the talk. There are options in Nitish and Sundar to beef up your batting, but if Bumrah doesn't play, India must find a way for Kuldeep Yadav in the starting XI.If not in dry and hot Birmingham, then when? Leeds was definitely a missed opportunity because there was a lot of rough to be exploited, and Kuldeep is one bowler who can be the X-factor in Bumrah's absence. It may come at the cost of runs, as Reddy or Sundar can contribute with the bat, but if the emphasis is on picking wickets, which India struggled to do on Day 5 in Leeds, then Kuldeep becomes a no-brainer.The fine balancing act needs to be played with perfection, as India have often looked the all-rounder's way in the past, and the trend could force them to look at Reddy or Sundar again. It gives them the depth which they have often desired but puts a lot of pressure on the likes of Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, and Akash Deep—likely to be the three quicks if Bumrah doesn't play—to do the job.Sundar, if preferred over Kuldeep, can give you control and even run through oppositions if the wicket offers purchase, but what if it doesn't? What if it continues to be true and flat? That is where India will miss Kuldeep, like they did in Leeds.And it’s for situations like those that India need to start taking the bold call of playing the wrist spinner. Because if not now, then when?","Two closed-door practice sessions meant there was no opportunity to see how the Indian cricket team worked on their fielding, specifically after the Leeds Test.

Australian vice-captain Steve Smith has defended national batting coach Michael Di Venuto against criticism from former Test wicketkeeper Ian Healy, who claimed Australia's batting performance had regressed under Di Venuto's tenure since 2021.Smith, speaking to reporters in Bridgetown on Sunday, rejected Healy's assessment while providing updates on his own finger injury recovery and potential return for the second Test against West Indies in St Georges.Smith dismissed Healy's suggestion that Di Venuto should be under pressure for the team's recent batting performances.""(Di Venuto's) not the one out there actually doing the batting. Guys have to be able to figure it out themselves out in the middle sometimes. You can't have someone holding your hand out there,"" Smith said.Smith further defended Di Venuto's capabilities and contribution to the team. ""He works as hard as anyone. He knows batting inside out. He's seen cricket all around the world, and knows all the conditions. He's done a wonderful job for a long time now, and the boys really enjoyed working with him,"" Smith stated.The criticism from Healy came after Australia's top order struggled in the first Test against West Indies, with Cameron Green scoring 3 and 15, and Josh Inglis making 5 and 12.""Australian cricket's batting head coach and every state batting coach, should be under pressure because there's not enough runs being scored around the nation either,"" Healy told SEN.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? ""Michael Di Venuto, a friend of mine who is a good coach and a good man has held the job since mid-2021. In this time, our national team batting has regressed in performance at the Test level,"" Healy added.Statistics show a decline in the Test batting average of Australia's top three from 45.94 in 2022 to 27.04 in 2025. Smith missed the first Test due to a compound dislocation in his finger during the World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord's.""I looked straight down and I was like, 'That doesn't look right. That looks pretty disgusting.' I wasn't sure of the extent of the damage,"" Smith recalled about his injury. During his recovery in New York, Smith maintained his practice in a unique way.""My mate actually told me about it. Underneath this bridge, there was a batting cage, and he was able to throw me a few balls there. It was nice to hit a few balls,"" Smith said.Smith expects to return for the second Test, though with modified fielding positions due to his injury. ""I don't feel any pain or anything. It's all feeling good, just getting used to the splint on and the slight, limited movement,"" Smith said.""It'll be just training as normal, and then probably fielding some balls in front of the wicket, which would probably be the strangest thing for me. I don't think I've ever done that in a Test match,"" he added.Smith also expressed support for struggling teammates Green and Sam Konstas. ""These guys are good players. We've got to give them an opportunity, it doesn't come around straight away. I think back to the start of my career, I think it took me 11 innings to score a hundred. It can take some time,"" Smith said.The second Test between West Indies and Australia is scheduled to begin in St George's on Thursday.",Australian vice-captain Steve Smith has defended national batting coach Michael Di Venuto against criticism.

As the 2025 edition of Wimbledon got underway, the famed lawns of the All England Club weren’t just graced by elite tennis stars—but also by a glittering lineup of personalities from sport, film, and entertainment. Football and tennis icons headlined the list of sports personalities.Among the early arrivals was former tennis world No.1 and 2004 Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova , who won the title here as a 17-year-old. Sharapova, who is set to be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame later this year, marked her return to SW19 (the postcode district for Wimbledon) with a selfie alongside David Beckham, captionedLet the (Wimbledon) games begin.Beckham, an ever-popular presence at Wimbledon, was among the high-profile guests in the Royal Box, a traditional focal point of the tournament’s celebrity presence. The former England captain, who famously scored in three different FIFA World Cups, is currently co-owner of Inter Miami CF, the MLS club captained by Lionel Messi.

Shubman Gill’s captaincy debut wins praise: Gambhir, Kotak & Jaiswal react!

India’s double Olympic medallist Neeraj Chopra is gearing up for the much-anticipated NC Classic, but ahead of the event, he took a break from training for a candid chat with official broadcasters JioStar, offering a fun mix of insights, reflections, and even a few cheeky predictions.In a light-hearted moment, Neeraj revealed which cricketer he believes could’ve excelled in his sport: “I have heard that Brett Lee was a javelin thrower. I think he could throw the javelin well, especially when he was in his peak years.”Lee, known for his blistering pace during his cricketing career, apparently has a javelin past — something Neeraj found intriguing.But that wasn’t his only cricket-javelin crossover. India’s pace ace Jasprit Bumrah was also on Neeraj’s wishlist.“I would like to try javelin with Jasprit Bumrah too, and hope he teaches me some bowling skills. While bowling and javelin are both throws, they are very different. I would like to learn from Bumrah.”Asked whose superpower he’d want to borrow for the perfect javelin throw, Neeraj didn’t hesitate: “Sachin Tendulkar.He represented our country so well for so many years. The way he faced challenges from many great bowlers and still performed exceptionally — I would want that superpower. It would help me handle challenges with a calm mindset.”Despite being at the top of his game, Neeraj steers clear of superstition on event day, adding, “I don’t think too much about it. I just focus on giving my 100%. I try to stay relaxed, eat good food, and rest well.”As for the best piece of advice he’s received? That came from his coach, Jan Železný, the world record holder in javelin.“He tells me to run in a flow — like an 18-year-old without tension. That it shouldn't feel tight. I'm learning the importance of flow. Like Roger Federer — it never seemed like he was putting in too much effort. I'm trying to bring that into my training.”Closing out the conversation, Neeraj found a fitting cricketing comparison for javelin technique: “The Helicopter Shot by MS Dhoni.”With the Neeraj Chopra Classic around the corner, fans can expect more than just record-breaking throws — perhaps even a few friendly crossover challenges with cricket’s best.",Neeraj Chopra is gearing up for the much-anticipated NC Classic.

The dashing left-hander, who scored a century (101) against England in the first Test at Leeds, will now continue to play for Mumbai in the upcoming domestic season.In a statement, the MCA said, ""The apex council has approved the withdrawal of the No Objection Certificate (NOC) that had been earlier requested by Yashasvi Jaiswal to represent another state. He will continue to be available for Mumbai."" MCA president Ajinkya Naik said, ""Yashasvi has always been a proud product of Mumbai cricket. We have accepted Jaiswal’s withdrawal NOC application and he will be available for Mumbai in forthcoming domestic season.

So I sincerely request MCA to allow me to play for Mumbai this season !

India’s title drought on the BWF World Tour came to an end on Sunday as Ayush Shetty delivered a commanding performance to lift his maiden title at the US Open Super 300. The 20-year-old from Mangalore outclassed third seed Brian Yang of Canada 21-18, 21-13 in the men's singles final, while teenager Tanvi Sharma's exciting run to the final ended in a defeat to Beiwen Zhang of the United States.Shetty, a bronze medallist at the 2023 Junior World Championships, capped off a stellar week that included a gritty comeback against top seed Chou Tien Chen in the semifinals. The Indian, seeded fourth, showed poise and precision in the final, securing victory in just 47 minutes for his third career win over Yang, having also beaten him earlier this year at the Malaysia and Taipei Opens.The contest began evenly with both players locked at 6-all, but Shetty pulled ahead with a string of winners to lead 11-6 at the mid-game interval. Though Yang rallied to level the score at 16-16, Shetty regained control with a series of smart placements and closed the first game with a decisive jump smash.In the second game, Shetty raced to a 7-2 advantage, and while Yang momentarily threatened a comeback, the Indian maintained his rhythm. Leading 17-12, Shetty sealed the win with a crisp cross-court punch and a powerful smash—securing a title that had eluded him in previous finals at the 2023 Odisha Masters, 2023 Bahrain International, and 2024 Dutch Open.Meanwhile, 16-year-old Tanvi Sharma impressed onlookers with her resilience in her first BWF World Tour final, taking a game off top-seeded Beiwen Zhang of the USA before falling 11-21, 21-16, 10-21 in a 46-minute battle.Zhang dominated the opener with an 11-5 lead that Sharma couldn’t bridge. However, the Indian youngster responded in style in the second game, racing to a 4-0 lead and maintaining her edge with aggressive play and precise shot-making to force a decider. The effort seemed to take a toll, though, as Zhang raced to an 11-4 lead in the final game and closed out the match without further resistance.While Shetty’s triumph marks a milestone for Indian badminton this season, Sharma’s spirited run is a precursor of bigger things to come.","Ayush Shetty wins maiden title at US Open Super 300. 20-year-old beats Brian Yang of Canada 21-18, 21-13 in the men's singles final.

Edgbaston Preview | Yashasvi Jaiswal faces the brunt, exits slip cordon

Former England all-rounder Moeen Ali made an unexpected appearance at England's training session in Birmingham on Monday. He offered his expertise on the Edgbaston pitch before the second Test against India.Ali, who retired from international cricket in 2024, visited his home ground to share his knowledge of the local conditions. His experience at Edgbaston, where he had numerous memorable performances, could prove valuable.The timing of Ali's visit is significant as England prepares for the second Test following their 5-wicket win in the series opener at Headingley. The Edgbaston pitch is expected to favour both batting and spin bowling from the third day.Head coach Brendon McCullum and spin bowling coach Jeetan Patel engaged in detailed discussions with the 36-year-old about the pitch characteristics. According to PTI sources, Ali's visit was a one-time occurrence, with no plans for a permanent coaching role.Since his retirement, Ali has been active in T20 leagues worldwide and participated in IPL 2025.His presence in Birmingham was solely to assist his former teammates.During his career, Ali was a significant contributor to England's Test side, notably during the 2015 Ashes campaign. His expertise in both batting and bowling could be particularly relevant given the expected spinning conditions.England captain Ben Stokes , who had previously convinced Ali to briefly return from retirement for an Ashes series, welcomed his former teammate's guidance for the India Test.England has maintained their unchanged playing XI for the Edgbaston Test, with Shoaib Bashir as the lone spinner. Ali's consultation suggests England's focus on understanding the spin aspects of the pitch.The Edgbaston surface traditionally favours spin bowlers as matches progress. England's decision to seek Ali's input demonstrates their thorough preparation approach.England enters the Edgbaston Test with momentum after successfully chasing 371 runs at Headingley against India.

Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra ’s recent comments have sparked a light-hearted yet nostalgic response from former Australian fast bowler Brett Lee — after the Indian javelin star suggested that Lee might have had the skills to excel in javelin during his cricketing prime.In a fun prelude to the NC Classic, Chopra shared a few offbeat insights during a chat with JioStar. Asked which cricketer could have made it as a javelin thrower, Chopra pointed straight at Lee. “I have heard that Brett Lee was a javelin thrower. I think he could throw the javelin well, especially when he was in his peak years,” said Neeraj, citing the former pacer’s legendary athleticism and explosive action.Lee, who was quick to catch wind of the comment, responded with humility and humour on X. “I did throw the javelin back at my schooling days, but nowhere near what Neeraj does & continues to do. Very tough on the elbow. I have however admired what this fine athlete can do and wish him well,” Lee wrote in response to a tweet citing the Olympian, earning applause from fans of both sports.Chopra also mentioned Jasprit Bumrah as another athlete he'd love to see try the javelin, noting the unique synergy between the two sports. “While bowling and javelin are both throws, they are very different.I would like to learn from Bumrah,” he said.In a twist, Neeraj added that if he could borrow any superpower, it would be Sachin Tendulkar’s mental fortitude — to face pressure with composure and consistency.The Neeraj Chopra Classic (NC Classic) is set to to be held on July 5 at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium in Bengaluru.",Neeraj Chopra said Brett Lee could have excelled as a javelin thrower.

Surrey County Cricket Club on Monday etched their name into the history books by posting a staggering 820/9 declared — the highest team total in the club’s history, surpassing the previous mark of 811 set back in 1899.The monumental feat came on Day 2 of their County Championship Division One clash against Durham at The Oval.Opener Dom Sibley led the charge with an epic 305 off 475 balls, anchoring Surrey’s innings with a masterclass in concentration and timing.It was his first triple-century in first-class cricket, decorated with 29 fours and 2 sixes.He was ably supported by Dan Lawrence, who blazed his way to a quickfire 178 off 149, and Sam Curran, whose aggressive 108 from 124 deliveries provided middle-order momentum.Not to be outdone, Will Jacks smashed 119 off just 94 balls, striking 8 fours and 4 sixes to ensure Surrey made the most of a fatigued Durham bowling unit.The scoreboard made for tough reading for Durham's bowlers — none more so than George Drissell, who endured a harsh spell of 1 for 247 in 45 overs.Will Rhodes emerged as the most successful bowler with 3 for 131.Durham, in response, ended Day 2 at 59/1, still trailing by a daunting 761 runs.Only Alex Lees (33 not out) showed early signs of resistance as Matthew Fisher claimed the lone wicket of Emilio Gay.With three days left and a mountain to climb, Durham’s chances look bleak.

TimesofIndia.com in Birmingham: As India prepare for a crucial clash in the second Test against England at Edgbaston, assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate offered rare insights into the team’s selection plans.Following a disappointing defeat at Headingley, India trail 0-1 in the five-match Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series, and changes could be on the cards.“I am very sure two spinners will play,” ten Doeschate told reporters on Monday. “Which ones, we are not sure yet. All three are bowling nicely. Washi (Washington Sundar) is batting really well too.”This suggests a likely return for India’s traditional two-spinner formula, possibly a mix of experience and all-round depth. Washington Sundar’s ability with the bat could tilt the balance in his favour, especially on a pitch expected to aid turn as the match progresses.Jasprit Bumrah’s availability, however, remains a bigger question. Though fully fit, the pace ace might be rested as part of India’s long-term workload management strategy. “Jasprit Bumrah is ready to play, we will take that call at the last moment,” ten Doeschate confirmed.Head coach Gautam Gambhir has made it clear that Bumrah will play only three of the five Tests in this series, irrespective of results. “The scoreline doesn’t change that,” Gambhir asserted after the first Test, stressing the importance of sustainability over urgency.Young all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy could also be in line for a debut. “He is very close to getting a game,” said ten Doeschate, praising his performance in the nets.After dropping four catches in the slips at Leeds, Jaiswal has been moved out of gully. In training, the slip cordon featured Karun Nair, KL Rahul, and captain Shubman Gill, with Reddy and Sai Sudharsan rotating between fourth slip and gully.""We always want depth in the catching department. In England, you're always going to have four catchers at some stage in the game. Yashasvi has been a very good catcher for us. We want to manage his confidence,"" said Doeschate.""There's also an argument for the short leg being a very important position, particularly if we are going to play two spinners. And we want to pick more guys in that position. So the more versatile we are as a fielding unit, the more guys can do more jobs.""And maybe just give Yashasvi a break from catching in the gully for a little while. His hands are quite sore. We want to get his confidence back up,"" said the assistant coach.Meanwhile, England have named an unchanged XI, sticking with the side that clinched a dramatic win in Leeds. Ben Stokes’s team looks confident, but India’s selection strategy could be the wildcard in what promises to be a tense second encounter.","India assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate confirms two spinners will play.

As India prepare to face England in the second Test of the five-match series at Edgbaston, history offers a reminder of the challenge that awaits. In eight Test matches played between the two sides at the venue from 1967 to 2022, England have dominated comprehensively, winning seven encounters and drawing one. India have never beaten England at Edgbaston in a Test match.Across these eight games, England boast an imposing average of 45.36 runs per wicket at a scoring rate of 3.47 runs per over. Their highest team total in these contests is a massive 710, while the lowest stands at 180. The win-loss ratio is technically undefined, as India have never registered a win at this ground against the hosts.The venue has traditionally favoured seam and swing, especially under overcast skies—conditions that have often exposed India’s batting vulnerabilities in the past. With pace expected to play a major role again this week, Edgbaston poses a significant test for India’s top order.Adding to the pressure is the outcome of the series opener at Headingley. England took a 1-0 lead with a clinical performance, chasing down a competitive fourth-innings target with five wickets in hand. Ben Duckett anchored the chase with a composed 149, while Jamie Smith impressed with a strong finish. India, despite flashes of promise and five individual centuries, were left to rue another batting collapse that allowed England to seize control.As the series shifts to Birmingham, India will need to overcome both current form and historical precedent to level the score.",England take a 1-0 lead in the five-match series against India.

Extreme heat

Poll Are you excited about the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup? Absolutely! Not really Only if the issues are resolved

As the final eight of the 2025 Club World Cup takes shape with teams like Chelsea and Palmeiras booking their spots, the tournament has become the target of criticism from several top figures in the sport. While thrilling matchups such as Paris Saint-Germain vs Inter Miami and Real Madrid vs Juventus keep fans on edge, the build-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup has exposed serious issues in the revamped 32-team Club World Cup.From matches being disrupted because of extreme heat to pitch concerns and an expanded format, players and coaches alike have raised concerns. Despite solid turnouts at some fixtures, the overall experience, both on and off the pitch, has left many questioning the planning behind the tournament.Chelsea may have comfortably defeated Benfica 4-1, but manager Enzo Maresca was far from being satisfied. The Italian coach vented his frustration after the match was delayed by nearly two hours due to lightning in Charlotte, North Carolina, stretching the game to five hours.“This is not the right place to do this competition,” Maresca said, noting it was already the sixth weather-related delay of the tournament.“If they are already suspending six, seven, eight games, probably there is something that is not working well.”Poor pitch quality has been another talking point of the competition. PSG boss Luis Enrique didn’t hold back, comparing the playing surface to a pothole-riddled basketball court after his side’s 2-0 win over Seattle Sounders.“I wouldn't imagine an NBA court full of holes,” said Enrique. “The ball bounces almost like if it were jumping around like a rabbit.”Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham also mirrored his concerns after his side’s 3-1 win over Pachuca. “The pitches aren’t great at all. It holds up the ball, the ball barely bounces,” said the England star. “It’s tough on the knees as well. Hopefully there's someone who will look at that going into the World Cup next year,” the player told Sky Sports.Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp called out the tournament's expanded format, pointing to a packed football calendar and player fatigue.""It's all about the game and not the surrounding events – and that's why the Club World Cup is the worst idea ever implemented in football in this regard,"" Klopp told Welt am Sonntag. “There is insane money for participating, but it’s also not for every club... That means no real recovery for the players involved, neither physically nor mentally.”Despite reports of low crowd numbers at certain matches, some fixtures have seen heavy attendance. Eighteen group-stage games drew over 40,000 fans, and a record 80,619 showed up to watch PSG thrash Atletico Madrid 4-0 at the Rose Bowl, making it the highest attended game in Club World Cup history.However, weekday games saw poor turnout, with the worst being Ulsan HD vs Mamelodi Sundowns in Orlando, where only 3,412 fans attended a match delayed by storms. This wasn't the lowest in tournament history, but it reflected poor turnout in less-hyped fixtures. That being said, the opening match between Al Ahly and Inter Miami drew 60,927 fans to Hard Rock Stadium.Sweltering conditions have plagued several games, with temperatures soaring to 36°C during Bayern Munich vs Benfica in Charlotte. Chelsea coach Maresca described trying to train in Philadelphia’s “code red” heat warning zone as “impossible.”Games have featured mandatory cooling breaks, with players using ice towels and dousing themselves in water to survive the conditions. The threat of thunderstorms also looms large, with five games facing lengthy delays due to lightning within a 10-mile radius of stadiums.Even Bundesliga giants Borussia Dortmund resorted to keeping their substitutes in the dressing room during matches. Their coach Niko Kovac described the dugout atmosphere as of that to a “sauna”.As the Club World Cup moves closer to its conclusion, the football on display has had its moments, but the criticism surrounding schedule, climate, and player welfare are casting long shadows over FIFA’s revamped project.","The 2025 Club World Cup has become the target of criticism from several top figures in the sport.

Concerns for the upcoming World Cup?

'New' tournament, same old favourites

List of qualified teams for Round of 16

As the 21st edition of the FIFA Club World Cup moves towards the Round of 16, the competition's facelift has provided multiple storylines. From the number of teams participating to a newly designed trophy, more venues and even a referee cam, the competition in the United States has gone closer to its namesake - the quadrennial World Cup.The organisers have called it ""a celebration of hope, excellence and pride, embodying the journey of every club, player and fan united in their passion for the beautiful game."" With several new debutants and the tournament now being a month-long event, the competition has changed in stature.Now, teams from all six confederations - 12 teams from Europe, 6 from South America, 4 from Africa, 4 from Asia, 4 from North, Central America and Caribbean, 1 from Oceania, and 1 team from the host nation complete the 2025 line-up.With the group stage done and dusted and just 16 teams left in the running, it is fair to say that this edition of the Club World Cup has had its fair share of upsets, David vs Goliath matchups and some heated moments, literally and figuratively.Ranked 4,971st in the Opta Power Rankings, Auckland City went in as the lowest ranked side in the Club World Cup. They were grouped alongside Bayern Munich, Benfica and Boca Juniors.To put things into context, Auckland City are made up of amateurs, play in the Northern League in New Zealand, comprising just 12 teams.Auckland suffered a brutal 0-10 loss against Bayern Munich to start with - the biggest defeat in this year's tournament - which was followed by a 0-6 thumping from Benfica.Already eliminated and with nothing to lose, Auckland faced Argentinian giants Boca Juniors in their last game. In what can only be described as a David-Goliath matchup, the underdogs denied Boca a spot in the Round of 16, who were in need of a win to progress. A difference of 4,819 ranking points and Boca's historical success made the 1-1 draw all the more sweet for the amateurs.Grouped alongside giants Porto, Al Ahly and Palmeiras, Lionel Messi's Inter Miami were expected to be swept aside. Instead, the Argentine No 10, supported by Luis Suarez, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets, powered through to the Round of 16, after finishing second in Group A.While the Herons could only pick up one win, it was enough to qualify. After a stalemate against Al Ahly in the tournament opener, Miami were up against Portuguese giants Porto. In what seemed like a difficult task for Miami, Messi's timeless brilliance, exemplified by a stunning free kick, earned them a 2-1 win. Miami drew their final game 2-2 against Brazil's Palmeiras, and confirmed their berth in the last 16.Tensions boiled over on the final matchday in Group E, where River Plate needed a win to make it to the last 16. Inter, however, denied them that pleasure. At the full-time whistle, River's Marcos Acuna and Inter's Denzel Dumfries nearly came to blows, needing an entire team and support staff to intervene. The feud, which first began three years ago, saw Argentina's Acuna show Netherlands' Dumfries the 2022 World Cup trophy logo on his shin guard. At the tournament, Argentina had beaten Netherlands in a heated quarter-final which finished on penalties.Heated moments weren't restricted to the players, as heatwaves and extreme temperatures saw teams give their players ice baths and cold towels. Borussia Dortmund went a step further, making their substitutes watch the game against Mamelodi Sundowns from the locker room and not from the bench to protect them from the blistering heat. Their coach likened the playing conditions to that of a 'sauna'. Thunderstorms and lightning also resulted in at least five games being delayed.But it isn't just ice packs, but ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement) who have been a presence at the tournament, making it the first to do so. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will also be a part of the tournament's setup, with non-citizens needing proof of legal status to attend games.With less than a year to go for the 2026 FIFA World Cup , set to be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada, its precursor has revealed several issues. From pitch quality, to heat and weather in general, the tournament hasn't been a smooth one to say the least.Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham called out the poor pitch conditions, saying ""The pitches aren’t great here. The pitches aren’t great at all,"" said the 21-year-old after his side's match against Pachuca at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte.Besides the underdog stories, major upsets and more teams, the tournament still remains a hunting ground for Europe's best. Giants like Real Madrid and Manchester City still remain favourites to win the prize. Five teams from the eight groups - Seattle Sounders, Urawa Reds, Ulsan, Wydad AC and Pachuca - were eliminated without a single point.Group A: Palmeiras, Inter MiamiGroup B: Paris Saint-Germain, BotafogoGroup C: Bayern Munich, BenficaGroup D: Flamengo, ChelseaGroup E: Inter Milan, MonterreyGroup F: Borussia Dortmund, FluminenseGroup G: Manchester City, JuventusGroup H: Real Madrid, Al Hilal",The 21st edition of the FIFA Club World Cup has come to an end.

David Beckham (Instagram Screengab)

David Beckham is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery for a long-standing wrist injury, with wife Victoria Beckham offering fans a glimpse into his recovery.On Friday, Victoria took to Instagram Stories to post a photo of the 50-year-old football icon lying in a hospital bed, dressed in a hospital gown with his arm resting in a blue sling.Captioning the photo “Get well soon daddy” with a heart emoji, the former Spice Girl and fashion designer showed support for her husband, who sustained the original injury back in 2003 during an England match.Though no further medical details were shared, the injury appears to be related to the same wrist issue that had lingered since his playing days. Despite the discomfort, Beckham appeared in good spirits, smiling gently for the camera as he recovered post-surgery.Victoria also posted another touching image of David holding a friendship bracelet bearing the message “Get well soon” spelled out in colorful beads -- likely a sweet gesture from one of their four children: Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, or Harper.The hospital update comes just weeks after it was announced that Beckham would receive a knighthood from King Charles, officially becoming “Sir David Beckham.” Victoria marked the news with pride on Instagram, writing, “You’ve always been my knight in shining armour, but now it’s official.”The couple recently celebrated Father’s Day as well, with Victoria sharing throwback clips and photos of David with their children, calling him “the best daddy there is.”Married since 1999, David and Victoria Beckham continue to show that family remains at the center of their lives—even during unexpected hospital stays.","David Beckham is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery for a long- standing wrist injury.

Lazio have recalled Romano Floriani Mussolini to the club following his loan spell at Serie B side Juve Stabia. The 22-year-old right back is the great-grandson of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and son of Alessandra Mussolini, a former European MP for Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party.Mussolini initially joined Lazio in 2022 but did not make any appearances for the club. He spent the 2023-24 season on loan at Pescara, where he played 32 matches.At Juve Stabia, Mussolini established himself as a regular starter, making 37 appearances across all competitions. He contributed one goal and four assists during his time there. Despite Juve Stabia's interest in signing him permanently, Lazio opted to bring him back.Fascist fan groups have been present across Italian football, with Lazio's hardcore supporters maintaining ties to the extreme right since the 1970s. The club's historic ultras group, the 'Irriducibili', maintained friendly relations with similarly right-wing supporters at Inter and Verona.Verona's fan base has been involved in several controversial incidents.Their supporters have directed racist chants at Mario Balotelli and Franck Kessie, displayed swastikas in the stadium, and once arranged cars at a fan gathering to form a Nazi symbol in 2014.Some 20 years ago, former Verona club president Giambattista Pastorello stated he wouldn't sign a black player due to potential fan reaction.Nine years prior to that statement, Verona fans wearing Ku Klux Klan hoods hung an effigy of black Dutch player Maickel Ferrier from the stands. This incident occurred in protest of his potential signing, which was subsequently cancelled.","Lazio have recalled Romano Floriani Mussolini from Serie B side Juve Stabia.

Poll Do you think Kylian Mbappe's legal complaint against PSG is justified? Yes, absolutely No, it's unnecessary

What India are doing in Birmingham today, practice schedule, plan and more

France captain Kylian Mbappe has filed a legal complaint accusing former club Paris Saint-Germain of ""moral harassment"", according to the Paris prosecutor's office, which confirmed on Thursday that an investigation into the matter has been opened.The 26-year-old, who officially joined Real Madrid this summer after a prolific seven-year spell with PSG, is also in a legal tussle with the French champions over unpaid dues. Mbappe is seeking €55 million ($64.4 million) in unpaid wages and bonuses from the club.Mbappe’s latest grievance stems from how he was treated during the early stages of the 2023–24 season. According to the complaint, the striker was excluded from the first-team setup and made to train separately with players PSG were actively looking to offload — a move he believes was punitive after he declined to extend his contract with the club.The issue echoes broader concerns about contract-related coercion in football, a topic that has previously drawn attention from the French players' union, which lodged a formal complaint in a similar context last year.bappe was also omitted from PSG’s pre-season tour of Asia in 2023 and missed the opening match of the campaign. He was later reinstated to the first team following talks with the club’s hierarchy.The legal action adds another layer of tension to Mbappe’s departure from the French capital, where he scored 256 goals in 308 appearances and won numerous domestic titles. Notably, PSG lifted the UEFA Champions League for the first time in their history just weeks after his exit.The outcome of the investigation could have significant implications for both Mbappe’s claims and the club’s management practices, particularly in how high-profile players are treated during contract disputes.","Kylian Mbappe has filed a legal complaint accusing former club Paris Saint- Germain of ""moral harassment"", according to the Paris prosecutor's office.

Al Nassr has announced a two-year contract extension with Cristiano Ronaldo that will keep him at the Saudi Arabian club until 2027. The announcement came on Thursday after months of uncertainty about his future.The 40-year-old star confirmed his commitment in a video released by the team where he stated: ""Al Nassr forever.""Ronaldo's arrival in 2023 sparked a trend, leading many established players in the latter stages of their careers to move to Saudi Arabia.There was speculation about Ronaldo's future when he posted ""This chapter is over"" after Al Nassr finished third in the Saudi Pro League without winning any trophies.""Ronaldo's presence is a key factor in developing the Saudi league in the last two years and a half. He opens the door for elite and young players to come to Saudi Arabia,"" said a source from the Public Investment Fund (PIF) to AFP.The Saudi PIF, which manages the country's sovereign wealth fund, oversees several Pro League clubs including Al Nassr, Al Hilal, and Al Ahli.The news of Ronaldo's extension follows Brazilian star Neymar's departure from Al Hilal in January.Neymar's brief 18-month stint saw him play only seven matches while earning a reported $104 million annually.Despite being the league's top scorer with 25 goals, Ronaldo has yet to secure any Saudi or continental titles with Al Nassr. The team recently lost in the Asian Champions League semi-finals.The five-time Ballon d'Or winner had previously mentioned the possibility of ending his career with Al Nassr, a team popular among Saudi royals.Saudi Arabia has transformed its football landscape by investing heavily in European talent, beginning with Ronaldo's transfer in late 2022. The country is also set to host the 2034 World Cup.Saudi football enthusiasts have enjoyed watching prestigious players like Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, who collectively hold six Ballons d'Or, during regular league matches.Some observers have drawn parallels between the Saudi Pro League and the Chinese Super League, which previously attracted players with high salaries before facing financial difficulties.The Saudi Pro League's development aligns with the country's broader goals of becoming a tourism and business destination before global oil demand decreases.Ronaldo initially joined Al Nassr two years ago in a deal reportedly worth $250 million, marking a significant shift in his career path to Saudi Arabian football.","Cristiano Ronaldo has signed a two-year contract extension with Al Nassr.

Reflecting on the special moment after the Tokyo race, he said, ""I was already tired after qualifying. I was feeling pretty stressed with everything. There was a lot of pressure to go through.I was looking forward to the race being over, to be honest, and when it was over... when I saw her face, I just couldn't help but be super emotional. ”""[The atmosphere] was amazing.

What sets the Berlin E-Prix apart

What’s challenging about the Tempelhof Circuit?

Past Berlin E-Prix winners

Season 11 of Formula E is now nearing its close, with four races remaining across two venues. Next up is the Berlin E-Prix, scheduled from July 11–13. Berlin is the only venue to have hosted a Formula E race every season since the championship's inception, making it one of the most special events on the calendar for multiple reasons. It has been held annually without a miss since 2015, and its scenic venue — the historic Tempelhof Airport — adds to its charm. Here are some interesting facts about Rounds 15 and 16 of the Formula E season in Berlin.One look at the Tempelhof circuit explains why the Berlin E-Prix is so special. With imposing aircrafts parked on one side of the barrier and a vast expanse of open space on the other, it’s arguably one of the most picturesque tracks in motorsport.Formula E cars are second only to airplanes when it comes to reaching top speeds — hitting 322 km/h in less than a minute. The most distinctive aspect of the Tempelhof Airport circuit is that it was originally designed for airplanes to take off and land, making it a unique surface for electric racing.The surface of the 2.343 km-long Tempelhof circuit is composed of layered concrete slabs designed for aircraft operations.While it supports Formula E racing, it presents challenges in energy management, tyre wear, and grip. The hot summer temperatures in Berlin can further test the drivers. Despite that, the wide layout, long corners, and even an indoor tunnel make the track exciting and full of overtaking opportunities.The Berlin E-Prix is a home race for DS Penske driver Maximilian Gunther. He won the event in 2020 and secured a third-place finish in 2023. The German driver recently expressed his excitement on Instagram. Reflecting on the Jakarta race, Gunther wrote, “Didn’t go our way this Saturday in Jakarta. Thanks for all the love, Indonesia. Now all eyes on Berlin – my home race.”However, it is TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa who holds the record for the most Berlin E-Prix wins, having triumphed three times — twice in 2020 and once in 2024. Envision Racing’s Sebastien Buemi, Lola Yamaha ABT’s Lucas di Grassi, and TCS Jaguar Racing’s Nick Cassidy have each won the race twice.Also Read: Season 11 Berlin Rookie Test: Formula E teams announce nominations, eligibility rules explained However, this year’s race may see a new winner, as has been the case in several recent Formula E rounds.

It was a dusty yet thrilling Formula E race in Jakarta, with the championship returning to Indonesia after two years. Formula E has now shared some of the best videos from the Jakarta E-Prix for fans to relive the Indonesian race again and again.

There are additional shots from different corners of the circuit, each offering a unique visual experience. One clip features Jake Dennis, who, despite securing pole position, was hit by Nyck De Vries during the race — ruining his chances of winning or finishing on the podium.A comment from Mahindra Racing’s Instagram page read: “If Wes Anderson directed FE.” A fan agreed, saying, “Accidentally, the dust and pollution in Jakarta matched with Wes Anderson’s color palette.”One fan reacted to the post, “Love the still camera angle.” Another said, “Ha, it certainly would.” One more wrote, “Straight out of a movie scene!” Another comment read: “I hope this event will still be held in Jakarta next year.

Do front row starts matter in Formula E? Oliver Rowland’s dominance says yes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/formula-e/do-front-row-starts-matter-in-formula-e-oliver-rowlands-dominance-says-yes/articleshow/122142779.cms,"Image credit: Oliver Rowland/Instagram

Formula E drivers with the most front row starts

Does pole position — or a front row start — guarantee a win? Well, in most cases, it does. If not, it at least enables the driver to finish the race on the podium or earn some points to add to their score in the Driver Standings. This season, it’s Nissan’s Oliver Rowland who has clinched five front row starts and is leading the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings. He is far ahead of the competition and is almost certain to have secured the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship title this year.Oliver Rowland is far ahead of the competition at the top of the Formula E Driver Standings with 172 points. He has taken pole twice and started on the front row in three other races this year.There is hardly any scenario in which anyone can beat him in the remaining four races — except one. If Pascal Wehrlein, who is second in the Driver Standings, wins and Rowland fails to score any points, then only can Rowland’s top spot be challenged. However, that is highly unlikely, and Rowland will most probably lift the world championship trophy in London with ease.TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein has three front row starts, including two poles.This suggests that front row starts do play a major role in a driver’s chances of a podium finish.Pascal, however, is behind Taylor Barnard, who has delivered the most impressive performance on track this year. The NEOM McLaren driver recorded four front row starts, including two poles this season. He already has four podium finishes in what can be considered his first year as a full-time Formula E driver.Meanwhile, DS Penske driver Maximilian Gunther, TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa, and Andretti’s Jake Dennis have two front row starts each this season. Among others who have grabbed pole position are Nissan’s Norman Nato, Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries, Cupra Kiro’s Dan Ticktum, and Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy.Also Read: Oliver Rowland’s daughter Harper turns four, Nissan driver shares glimpse of her birthday celebrations There are four more races to go before the current Formula E season comes to an end.

Watch: Extrication practice in Formula E

Every motorsport involves risk, where a single crash can prove life-threatening. Formula E has maintained a strong safety record over its eleven seasons so far. However, as a precautionary measure, Formula E drivers undergo extrication practice once a year to ensure they are familiar with the emergency protocols in case of an incident. Recently, NEOM McLaren driver Sam Bird participated in one such practice session. A glimpse of the session was shared with fans on social media, offering insight into this important aspect of motorsport safety.The video shows Sam Bird acting as an injured driver while the FIA Formula E safety team carefully lifts him out of the car and places him on a stretcher. The procedure is designed to avoid further injury, particularly to the neck or any broken bones.McLaren FE shared the video on Instagram with the caption: “Earlier today, Sam completed his extrication practice with the @fiaformulae safety team. This is an exercise that happens at each race with a different team each time. This is for both the safety of the drivers and the extrication team should an incident occur where the driver would need assistance exiting the car. Each driver has to do this at least once a year to ensure their own safety.Some fans were momentarily alarmed upon seeing the video. One commented, “Goodness grief — not me watching the first few seconds of this without context.” Another said, “That scared me there for a second.”In general, fans appreciated the behind-the-scenes look at Formula E's extrication protocol. “Never seen the neck wrap/support before, very neat,” wrote one. Another added, “Much love to the safety teams, always prepared and always do an incredible job.” A third said, “Awesome to see, safety above all.” One fan even joked, “An FIA-mandated nap sounds quite nice.”Also Read: Who is Sam Bird’s girlfriend Jess Impiazzi?

Training local marshals at Formula E circuits

Safety and technical knowledge are paramount in Formula E, where the sport involves handling some of the world’s fastest electric cars. Now, the FIA has given fans a behind-the-scenes look at how local marshals in each host country are trained before every Formula E race to ensure that operations run swiftly, efficiently, and to the highest standards.A video shared on the FIA Official Instagram page features Benoit Dupont, Head of Circuit Operations at FIA Formula E, offering a glimpse into the marshal training process at the Jakarta E-Prix.Speaking about the preparation in Jakarta this year, Dupont explains, “Before each Formula E race, we make sure that marshals are trained to the correct level to understand how to efficiently remove and recover a car. It's very important to have precise and fast operations. We've been in Indonesia before, but it was two years ago, so the goal here is to bring everyone back up to speed.”He adds that Formula E cars require a specific method of being lifted, particularly using a strap in a defined way. As a result, every post is trained individually to ensure marshals are fully up to date.Dupont also highlights the crucial role of the clerk of the course, who acts as a bridge between FIA officials and local marshals.He says, “Leaving a legacy is an important part of what the FIA brings to these races. There are international procedures that might not be followed at local races, so we ensure they meet the latest standards. That’s why we conduct training sessions like this,” he says. “The clerk of the course connects with the marshals, all the trackside personnel, and the recovery team. Since they communicate in their local language, the clerk ensures the communication line remains as efficient as possible.”Commenting on the video, one Formula E fan wrote, “Well done on showcasing these wonderful men and women who keep races going and clear up the mess after an OOPS moment from the drivers.”Also Read: Dan Ticktum shares unfiltered pictures and a note after Jakarta win, mentions losing F1 chance: “It wasn’t down to my attitude” The Jakarta E-Prix was a single-header this year, unlike its double-header format in the 2023 season. With just four more races remaining, the 2024–25 Formula E season is nearing its conclusion. Next up is the Berlin double-header on July 11–12, followed by the season finale in London on July 26–27.","FIA gives fans a behind-the-scenes look at how local marshals in each host country are trained before every Formula E race.

Dan Ticktum shared several memorable pictures from race day and the victory celebration after winning his maiden Formula E race in Jakarta.

Starting from the very beginning, he wrote, “So there it is, first win in @fiaformulae in the books. I am immensely proud of what this great team of people have achieved this year. As some of you know, I was very close to being in F1 several years ago, but due to some political s****, it wasn’t meant to be. (For those too ignorant — no, it wasn’t down to my attitude). I was ready to give up racing, as at the time, my dream — to me at least — was over.”Moving to his switch to Formula E, he added, “However, an opportunity arose to take part in this exciting, relatively new championship, full of the best drivers in the world.@alexhuigusto and @russellohagan were instrumental in giving me this opportunity, and they, along with the rest of the team, have stuck by me during three very tough years being the least funded team on the grid. This year, with our new investment, it has enabled us to embark on an exciting new chapter with @porsche.motorsport and @cupra_official. The support from them has been immense.”He further wrote, “Long story short — I’m glad I didn’t give up and kept trying to pursue big things in motorsport. The @fiaformulae championship, and @jeffformulae in particular, have given me an environment where I can be me (mostly), and I can finally say that this year I’m enjoying my job again. Thank you to everyone who has supported me to this point. I know it’s only one race win, but it conjured up a lot of emotions for me personally, along with my father and family, who sacrificed so much. Plenty more to come, I hope. Onto Berlin!”Posting pictures of himself showing middle fingers to the camera, he added at the end, “P.S. Last 2 slides are for all those who doubted me.”IndyCar racer Louis Foster reacted to his post, saying, “Mega mega mega mate.” There was also a congratulatory message from the FIA Formula E page. Social media star Juca Vipari wrote, “YESSSSS BROTHER! The first of many!!”A fan also told Ticktum in the comments section, “Enjoy 1 million beers.” Another said, “A fight-or-flight mode and you chose the harder option with an EXTREMELY high reward — and it paid off! Congrats Dan! The first of many.” One more added, “So deserved. Thinking from the end of last year to where you and the team are now — seriously amazing work.

Sergio Aguero takes on the race track in a GEN3 Evo



All about GEN3 Evo Sessions

Manchester City star Sergio Aguero is one of the few chosen ones to get a chance to drive a Formula E car on a race track. The footballer had his own GEN3 Evo session, guided by none other than TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein. And Aguero nailed it by driving the electric race car like a pro, although he missed his engineer’s message to slow down to cool the tyres.Sergio Aguero got the opportunity to drive the Porsche 99X Electric GEN3 Evo Formula E car during Miami’s Evo Sessions on March 5 and 6. The video from his Evo session is pure entertainment, as he takes lap after lap, clearly enjoying the thrill of driving a race car.Earlier, the official handle of FIA Formula E shared a video from Sergio’s Evo Session on Instagram. It showed how the footballer missed the messages to slow down and continued at high speed despite the need to cool the tyres. He later asked them to raise the volume and eventually slowed down. Pascal Wehrlein was seen doing a great job coaching him over the radio.The 37-year-old told Formulae.com about the opportunity, “This is absolutely crazy: from footballer to racing driver in one of the fastest racing cars in the world.Every child is familiar with Porsche. The brand represents an iconic heritage, particularly in motorsport. I am absolutely delighted and would like to thank everyone involved for this unique opportunity.”Aguero and other participants underwent detailed training, which included simulator sessions, physical conditioning, driver coaching, hardware customization, and engineering briefings. It not only gave them the thrill of driving a race car but also gave viewers insight into the intricate world of Formula E — how a driver is trained and how the car is driven during a race. A complete documentary will be released later this year, showcasing the entire Evo Sessions footage.Sharing his reaction when Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds first presented the idea, he said, “The initial reaction when I presented the concept of ‘Evo Sessions’ to our teams and partners was, ‘This is wild!’ — which is when I immediately knew we had to bring it to life. We wanted to do something that has never been done before in motorsport; something that would give audiences and our fan base a unique perspective into the world of a Formula E driver, through the eyes of some of their favourite online personalities. ”He added, “Formula E is the fastest-growing motorsport in the world, and we have a clear target to hit half a billion fans by 2030. Through collaborating with some of the biggest names in popular culture right now, we’re able to open up Formula E to a whole new fanbase.”Also Read: Pascal Wehrlein on second place in Shanghai: “First time I felt like we were very competitive in the wet” Even the trainers are among the best Formula E drivers in the world. Pascal Wehrlein is currently second in the 2025 Driver Standings with 103 points. He won the Miami E-Prix along with three more podiums this year. He will next compete in the Berlin double-header next month.","Manchester City star Sergio Aguero was one of the few chosen to get a chance to drive a Formula E car on a race track.

India Asia Cup prediction: Why bad news could be in store for India | Greenstone Lobo predicts

In cricket, few contests stir as much excitement as India versus Pakistan . The rivalry commands attention like no other, generates endless discussion, and evokes the strongest emotions. So as Pakistan prepared for their opening Asia Cup game against Oman, the conversation was already shifting to the blockbuster clash that follows against India. The focus was evident when Pakistan's head coach, Mike Hesson, spoke to the media ahead of his team’s first match.While India are the current world champions and top-ranked in T20Is, Hesson acknowledged the challenge that lies ahead. He said Pakistan were ready to rise to it. ""We know that India are obviously hugely confident, and rightfully so, in terms of how well they've played. We're very much focused on improving as a team, sort of day by day, and not getting too far ahead of ourselves, but we're well aware of the... I wouldn't say the enormity of the task, I'd say the challenge of the task ahead, and we're certainly looking forward to it,"" he said.Hesson expressed strong faith in his bowling attack, particularly highlighting spin all-rounder Mohammad Nawaz. After missing out on Pakistan's T20 World Cup squad last year, Nawaz has made a notable return, including taking a hat-trick and a five-wicket haul against Afghanistan in the tri-series final involving UAE.""I guess the beauty of our side is we've got five spinners. We've got Mohammed Nawaz, who's the best spin bowler in the world at the moment, and he's been ranked that way over the last six months since he's come back in the side. And obviously we've had Abrar [Ahmed] and Sufiyan [Muqeem] do as well as he has. Saim Ayub is now in the top ten all-rounders in the world. So obviously that comes on the back of his improved performance with the ball. And Salman Ali Agha has hardly bowled, and he's obviously the test spinner for Pakistan,"" he added.The highly anticipated clash will take place in Dubai, where India demonstrated their dominance by bowling out UAE for just 57, with Kuldeep Yadav claiming four wickets. Pakistan will get a chance to adapt to the conditions in their match against Oman, also at the Dubai venue.Hesson noted that conditions could vary and that the pitch might not offer as much spin as Sharjah did. He added, ""Look, I don't think you can expect that this pitch is gonna spin like it did in Sharjah. And even yesterday when Kuldeep [Yadav] bowled, it didn't spin a huge amount. I think whenever you've got wrist spinners like that it doesn't really matter about the surface as much.""Dubai is preparing to host Pakistan versus Oman first, but all eyes are already on the showdown that will follow. India have already shown their strength, Pakistan is ready to respond, and the stage is set for one of cricket’s most intense rivalries.",Pakistan take on Oman in their opening Asia Cup match in Dubai. Head coach Mike Hesson says his side are ready to take on India. Hesson praises spin all-rounder Mohammad Nawaz for his return to the side.

Poll What do you think is the main reason for low ticket sales at the Asia Cup matches? Absence of star players Ticket prices Weekday evening games

Former India cricketer and commentator Aakash Chopra shared his thoughts on why tickets for the upcoming India versus Pakistan match in the Asia Cup are not selling out as quickly as expected. He pointed to the absence of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli as a major factor.Chopra explained that both players are huge crowd-pullers, and their absence has a proportional impact on ticket sales. “When Virat went to play a Ranji Trophy match, even then the stadium almost filled up. Their absence is one of the big reasons why tickets are not getting filled,” he said.He also noted that even in the UAE, where cricket fans usually fill stadiums quickly, grounds have remained partially empty. Bangladesh, India, and Afghanistan have already played matches in the tournament, but no stadium has seen full capacity so far. Chopra clarified that this is not because tickets are overpriced or due to the working community in the UAE finding it difficult to attend weekday evening games.He highlighted just how much of a difference Rohit and Kohli make when they are playing. “If they were present, the turnout could have been double. Hypothetically, if 5,000 people came earlier, at least 10,000 to 15,000 would have come to watch if Rohit and Kohli were there. They rarely get the chance to see them in person, so their absence is significant,” he added.India will take on Pakistan on 14 September, Sunday, in Dubai.","Former India cricketer and commentator Aakash Chopra shared his thoughts on why tickets for the upcoming India versus Pakistan match in the Asia Cup are not selling out as quickly as expected.

Patrick Mouratoglou, the acclaimed French tennis coach, spoke to The Guardian about his experiences with some of the sport’s biggest names, including Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, and the challenges posed by rising stars Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.Mouratoglou first gained international attention guiding Marcos Baghdatis to the 2006 Australian Open final, but it was his partnership with Serena Williams that truly cemented his reputation. Together, they won 10 of her 23 Grand Slam singles titles. Reflecting on their collaboration, Mouratoglou told The Guardian that their success was built on mutual trust and motivation.“We had big trust on both sides. I knew how to motivate her, how to provoke her to be more competitive,” he said. Their partnership began during a tough period for Serena, who had suffered a first-round loss at the 2012 French Open , her first ever early exit at a Grand Slam.To rebuild her confidence, Mouratoglou and Serena developed creative strategies. For instance, ahead of Roland Garros, he instructed her to serve only second serves during the Madrid warm-up to make her work for every point. The approach forced her to stay fully focused and build confidence on clay, helping her achieve a remarkable 28-0 record that year.Mouratoglou also discussed Serena’s post-pregnancy fitness journey.He explained that tennis demands precise physical efficiency. “Even one kilo can make a difference. Tennis involves sudden direction changes at high speed, and every fraction of a second counts. I told her this isn’t about how she looks; it’s about her performance. Her movement was affected, and for her to return to the top, she needed to be as efficient as possible. ”He acknowledged the challenges of age and recovery. “Serena was older, and the body doesn’t bounce back the same. The risk of injury is higher. We had a few disagreements because she felt judged. But my focus was on her tennis, not her appearance. If she wanted to make history again, we had to be very efficient on every level, including this.”Turning to the current men’s game, Mouratoglou addressed the dominance of Alcaraz and Sinner. He compared it to the Federer-Nadal era, noting that players who believe they can break through are the ones who succeed, citing Novak Djokovic as an example.On Naomi Osaka, Mouratoglou explained that their partnership ended after 10 months because, despite her strong practice and mindset, match results were inconsistent. “She needed to feel lighter on court to express her tennis freely. There are no hard feelings. She’s an incredible competitor, and seeing her regain top form is fantastic for women’s tennis.”Mouratoglou’s reflections offer a rare insight into the strategy, psychology, and attention to detail that define champions, showing that success in tennis is as much about mental and physical efficiency as it is about talent.","Patrick Mouratoglou, the acclaimed French tennis coach, spoke to The Guardian about his experiences with Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, and the challenges posed by rising stars Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.

NEW DELHI: It’s a week of intense India-Pakistan rivalry, and the spotlight won’t be limited to cricket. While the two nations clash in a mouth-watering Asia Cup match on Sunday, attention will also turn to the athletics arena, where India’s Neeraj Chopra and Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem will go head-to-head in the javelin at the Tokyo World Championships next week.Chopra and Nadeem showdown marks the latest chapter in a rivalry between the neighboring nations, which has been further strained following a deadly four-day military conflict in May—the worst since 1999.Chopra, the Tokyo Olympic champion, and Nadeem, the Paris Olympics gold medallist, will face each other for the first time in competition since the tensions escalated. Despite the political backdrop, Chopra has previously spoken about his friendly rapport with Nadeem, emphasizing mutual respect even amid the fraught relations between their countries.After Nadeem won gold and Chopra stood alongside him on the podium in Paris, Nadeem's mother Raziah Parveen said: ""Winning and losing is part of sport, but they are like brothers.""Chopra's mother Saroj said she took some solace in Nadeem beating her son because the Pakistani ""is also our boy"".But publicly at least that changed after the conflict, with high-profile figures from both countries under pressure to distance themselves from the other side.The 27-year-old Chopra, who will defend his world title in Tokyo, said that they were ""never really close friends"".Nadeem, 28, also played down any friendship with Chopra.""When he won, I congratulated him, and when I won the gold, he returned the same courtesy,"" Nadeem told AFP by telephone en route to Tokyo.""(Just as) in wrestling, one wrestler wins and the other loses -- it's part of the game.""Nadeem, who is returning to competition after calf surgery in July, hails from a farming village.He became an overnight sensation when he gave Pakistan their first Olympic gold in 40 years with a Games-record throw of 92.97m.Nadeem has competed only once since Paris, winning the Asian Athletics Championships in South Korea in May when Chopra did not participate.The last time the pair clashed was at the Paris Olympics.In April, the Indian star invited Nadeem to India for his 'Neeraj Chopra Classic' javelin event but the Pakistani declined, saying it clashed with his training schedule.Chopra then withdrew the invitation after an attack in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22 killed 26 people, mostly Hindu tourists.India accused Pakistan of backing the attackers, a charge Islamabad denied.In the conflict that followed more than 70 people were killed in missile, drone and artillery fire on both sides.""I want to clarify that I don't have a particularly strong relationship with Nadeem, we were never really close friends,"" Chopra said afterwards.""But because of the current situation, things will not be as they were. That said, if someone speaks to me with respect, I always respond in kind.""Chopra became a national hero in India after his Tokyo gold, earning million-dollar endorsement deals with his boyish charm, changing hairstyles and infectious smile.He won the world title in Budapest in 2023 and has been in fine form since joining Czech javelin great Jan Zelezny's coaching group ahead of the 2025 season.He went past 90m for the first time when he threw 90.23m at the Doha Diamond League meeting in May, but finished second to German Julian Weber.At the Zurich Diamond League last month, Weber once again stood on top of the podium, with a throw of 91.51m. Chopra was second with 85.01m.Along with Weber, also in Tokyo will be two-time world champion Anderson Peters of Grenada.The world championships start on Saturday, with the men's javelin final on September 18.(With inputs from AFP)",Neeraj Chopra and Arshad Nadeem will go head-to-head in the javelin at the Tokyo World Championships next week. The Tokyo Olympic champion and the Paris Olympics gold medallist will face each other for the first time in competition since the tensions escalated.

NEW DELHI: Model Brooks Nader’s sister, Grace Ann Nader, confirmed speculation about a possible relationship between Brooks and tennis star Carlos Alcaraz on Wednesday. Grace Ann clarified that Carlos has met Brooks’ sisters, Mary Holland Nader, 26, and Sarah Jane Nader, 23. She herself has not met him yet but is looking forward to it.""The rumours are true,"" Grace Ann told E! News. ""Dating is such a loose term. But I do know he's the man of the hour.""Brooks, 28, was recently linked to tennis player Jannik Sinner after being spotted at the US Open. She denied those claims, explaining that she was actually watching Alcaraz’s match against Arthur Rinderknech, not Sinner’s game.Carlos, 22, discussed his dating life in a July 2024 interview with The Sunday Times: ""I am single. I am looking for someone. It can be difficult as a tennis player to meet the right person because you are travelling all the time.""He also emphasized the importance of family support: ""To them I am not a big tennis star, just a normal guy."" Carlos mentioned enjoying time at home with his family after tournaments, regardless of results.The tennis star currently lives with his parents and three brothers in Spain, maintaining strong family ties despite his professional success.Brooks has not personally confirmed the relationship. Both continue to focus on their respective careers, though family members report that they have been spending time together.","Model Brooks Nader’s sister, Grace Ann Nader, confirmed speculation about a relationship between Brooks and Carlos Alcaraz.

Asia Cup: Gautam Gambhir in a serious discussion with India vice-captain Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: Left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav and seamer Shivam Dube ran through the United Arab Emirates’ batting lineup as India romped to a nine-wicket win in their Asia Cup 2025 opener on Wednesday. Kuldeep’s sharp googlies earned him figures of 4 for 7, while Dube claimed 3 for 4, helping bowl out UAE for just 57 in 13.1 overs — the lowest-ever T20 total against India.In reply, India made light work of the chase, reaching 60 for 1 in just 4.3 overs. Opening batter Abhishek Sharma impressed with 30 off 16 balls, hitting three sixes and two boundaries, while Shubman Gill remained unbeaten on 20.After the victory, Gill posted on social media: “Step one.”UAE’s innings never truly got going despite a reasonable start from Alishan Sharafu (22) and captain Muhammad Waseem (19), who put together 41 for 2 in the powerplay.India’s relentless bowling soon took control. Bumrah dismissed Sharafu with a pinpoint yorker and Mohammad Zohaib was caught at backward point attempting an ambitious shot against Varun Chakravarthy.Kuldeep’s three-wicket over, which included a plumb leg-before dismissal of Waseem, dismantled the middle order.Dube then struck thrice in his two overs, and UAE folded with more than six overs to spare.A rare moment of confusion saw Junaid Siddique initially stumped, but India withdrew the appeal after he explained that Dube’s rag distracted him. He fell the next ball trying to recover. Kuldeep finished the innings by having Haider Ali caught behind.India’s chase was clinical. Abhishek launched Ali’s first ball over wide extra cover for a six and continued to dominate before falling off a miscued short ball. Suryakumar Yadav then smashed Siddique for a six, and Gill sealed the win with a boundary to mid-on.India now head into their next group matches against Pakistan and debutants Oman, having made a resounding statement in Dubai.","India beat United Arab Emirates by nine wickets in their Asia Cup opener.

For years, Ram Vilas Shah, a migrant labourer from Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh, sold fruit juice on his rehri (cart) outside Gate No. 1 of the IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali. His daily customers were a young batter by the name of Shubman Gill and his father Lakhwinder, who would stop for a glass of mosambi juice. Ram Vilas's son, Avinash Kumar , used to be a fast bowler and trained at the ground behind the Mohali Stadium.One day in 2014, Lakhwinder spotted Avinash near the cart and asked about his father. ""I told him, 'paaji, I've quit cricket. I am working in a photo studio. Today I am here because my father is not well,'"" Avinash recalls in a conversation with TimesofIndia.com.""I played cricket after my father requested one of the PCA coaches. I am two years senior to Shubman. I was a fast bowler but I quit cricket because of our family's financial constraints,"" he explains.A few months later, Lakhwinder spotted Avinash at his father's cart again and blasted him for quitting cricket.""Lakhwinder paaji was angry. He told me cricket can change your family's life. He was unhappy with my decision to walk away from cricket, and was even more miffed after I told him that I work in a photo studio,"" he says with a laugh now.A week later, Lakhwinder showed Avinash a video of a side-arm thrower and asked him to start practising and take the profession seriously.""I saw the video. Lakhwinder paaji helped me get one side-arm and I started mastering it,"" he says.From then on, Avinash’s friendship with Shubman Gill grew stronger.""I knew him from the academy. But now I became his personal side-arm thrower. Woh din tha aur aaj ka din hai. Hum ikkathe hai (There was that day and it is now. We've been together),"" Avinash proudly says.Avinash would earn Rs 150–200 per day but he personally never took a penny from Shubman or his father.""I never used to take money from Shubman's father. He has been my guiding light. He gave me money during festivals like Holi and Diwali. He took me to the hospital and also helped my family whenever we were in need. I will always be grateful,"" he says.Avinash recalls the early changes in Shubman’s batting.""Lakhwinder paaji used to get angry whenever Shubman played a lofted shot. Shubman would only hit in the V. It was only after the U-19 World Cup, followed by the IPL , that he started working on range-hitting,"" he says.""It surprised me because he used to say, 'what’s the point of getting out trying to score two extra runs? I can hit boundaries without taking risks.' But he realised that in T20, he needed to work on six-hitting. He started working on it and never looked back,"" he says.Avinash also explains how meticulous Gill’s preparations are.""He comes to every net session with a purpose. Even if he bats for three hours, he has the same intent. After the nets, he watches his videos, checks the areas where he’s troubled, watches his dismissals, and the next day he follows the same routine again,"" he adds.In 2019, Avinash became a side-arm thrower for the Punjab Ranji team and was instantly liked by senior pros like Mandeep Singh and Gurkeerat Mann, while bonding with youngsters like Shubman, Abhishek Sharma, Prabhsimran Singh, and Anmolpreet Singh.In 2024, in jest he told Shubman, 'Yaar ab tu captain ban gaya, mujhe bhi IPL le chal' (You have become captain of Gujarat Titans, take me with you).Shubman’s assuring words gave him hope. ""He told me I didn’t need to worry.""Earlier this year, Avinash was playing with his newborn son in Chandigarh when he received a call from Shubman.""Shubman told me to pack my bags as I would soon get a call from the Gujarat Titans management. He has gifted me spikes, clothes, mobiles — but this was something else. It was precious,"" he recalls.Even before IPL 2025, Shubman’s eyes were set on the five-Test series against England. With Khushpreet Singh Aulakh, his mentor and childhood friend, around, he also needed someone who could challenge him with the red ball. Avinash had a reputation for troubling Punjab batters during Ranji seasons.""It was KP paaji’s idea. He told Shubman to start practising with the red ball during the IPL itself. KP paaji has invested his entire life in Shubman. He has worked tirelessly on him.""When I joined the Titans, Shubman instructed me to challenge him at the nets with the red ball. I started doing it. With the red ball, I make life difficult for batters. With the white ball, throwers give batters confidence to hit, but with the red ball, it’s a battle,"" Avinash says.Avinash bent his back in the nets, and it helped Shubman amass 754 runs in England.Avinash doesn’t want credit. ""It is all his hard work. I’ve given him so many bruises but he never complained. His father first, and then KP paaji—these two have made Shubman what he is today,"" he says.""Maine kya kiya bas usko knocking karwayi (I only helped him with the knocking). For what his father has done for me and my family, I will always be indebted,"" he says.At his father’s cart, meeting Shubman was a blessing for Avinash. He now considers the Gills his own family. At that cart, Shubman found not just juice—but a lifelong friend and confidante.",Avinash Kumar used to be a fast bowler and trained at the ground behind the Mohali Stadium. Avinash would earn Rs 150–200 per day but he personally never took a penny from Shubman or his father. Lakhwinder paaji was angry.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh will kick off their Asia Cup 2025 campaign against Hong Kong at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Thursday, facing a team still recovering from a heavy opening loss to Afghanistan. Hong Kong were dismantled by 94 runs in their first match, managing only 94 for nine while chasing Afghanistan’s 188 for six. With just two batters reaching double figures, their fragile lineup faces another stern test, and their bowlers will need to quickly regroup after being taken apart in the death overs.For Bangladesh, the match presents an ideal opportunity to start the tournament on a strong note and build momentum before tougher group-stage encounters against Sri Lanka on September 13 and Afghanistan on September 16. Historically, Bangladesh’s Asia Cup journey has been a tale of near misses—they have reached the final three times (2012, 2016, and 2018) but have fallen short each time against established sides like India and Sri Lanka.Litton Das will lead the team for his fifth Asia Cup appearance, but his first as full-time captain in a major continental tournament. Serving as both wicketkeeper and batter, he provides a stabilizing presence. The squad blends experience with youthful energy, featuring Nurul Hasan’s return after nearly three years, offering depth in both batting and keeping. Middle-order aggressor Towhid Hridoy, death-over specialist Mustafizur Rahman, and emerging new-ball bowler Tanzim Hasan Sakib further strengthen Bangladesh’s balanced attack.Bangladesh arrive in the UAE on the back of strong form, having won three consecutive series against Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and the Netherlands. Yet, the weight of past disappointments lingers, with the team eager to convert potential into silverware on the continental stage.Bangladesh and Hong Kong have met only once before, in the 2014 T20 World Cup, where Hong Kong pulled off a surprise win.: September 11: 8:00 PM IST / 6:30 PM local time: Sony Sports Network: SonyLiv: Litton Das (C, WK), Tanzid Hasan, Parvez Hossain Emon, Saif Hassan, Towhid Hridoy, Jaker Ali, Shamim Hossain, Nurul Hasan, Mahedi Hasan, Rishad Hossain, Nasum Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Tanzim Hasan, Taskin Ahmed, Shoriful Islam, Mohammad Saifuddin: Yasim Murtaza (C), Babar Hayat, Zeeshan Ali, Niazakat Khan Mohammad, Nasrulla Rana, Martin Coetzee, Anshuman Rath, Kalhan Marc Challu, Ayush Shukla, Mohammad Aizaz Khan, Ateeq ul Rehman Iqbal, Kinchit Shah, Ali Hassan, Shahid Wasif, Ghazanfar Mohammad, Mohammad Waheed, Ehsan Khan","Bangladesh will kick off their Asia Cup 2025 campaign against Hong Kong on Thursday.

Poll Who do you think will win the India vs Pakistan match? India Pakistan

NEW DELHI: Dubai is buzzing with anticipation ahead of the Asia Cup 2025, but one surprising detail has left fans and experts stunned. With handful of days to go for the blockbuster India vs Pakistan clash on September 14 , tickets for the high-voltage contest are still available — although some prices have gone as high up as Rs 2.5 lakh for just two seats!An Emirates Cricket official speculated that the low sales might be due to the absence of stars Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, who retired from the shortest format last year.""We are surprised that flow of sales for India vs Pakistan is much low, till the time we sold out with lower stands only but the upper and top tear stands are still on sale, in the Champions Trophy for the same match we had sale on two times in a single day like we opened ticket window 2pm and 4pm and we were sold out that time in just less then 4 minutes, but this time craze is very dull, it might be it's because of absence of Rohit and Virat,"" said an official from Emirates Cricket to news agency ANI.The stage was set on Tuesday in Dubai for the official captains’ press conference. Organisers carefully arranged seating, keeping India skipper Suryakumar Yadav and Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha apart, with Afghanistan’s Rashid Khan seated in between. The move avoided direct proximity of the two arch-rival leaders and maintained a composed atmosphere ahead of what remains cricket’s fiercest rivalry.While India open their campaign against hosts UAE on September 10, the marquee showdown against Pakistan four days later has long been the talk of the tournament.Traditionally, tickets for this fixture are snapped up within hours. But this year, the combination of eye-watering prices and packaged sales appears to have slowed demand.On the ticketing portals (viagogo and platinumlist), a pair of seats in the VIP Suites East is listed at a staggering Rs 257,815. The package includes aisle seating, unlimited food and drinks, a parking pass, VIP club/lounge access, and private entrance and restrooms. The Royal Box comes at Rs 230,700 for two, while the Sky Box East is priced at Rs 167,851. Even mid-tier categories remain costly — Platinum at Rs 75,659, Grand Lounge at Rs 41,153, Pavilion West at Rs 28,174 — while the most affordable, General East, still costs nearly Rs 10,000 for two.The fact that premium tickets remain unsold is a rare sight for an India-Pakistan contest, traditionally regarded as the hottest ticket in world cricket.“Aggression (is) always there on field and you can’t do without aggression if you want to win,” India captain Suryakumar Yadav declared, signalling his team will bring intensity to the clash. His counterpart Salman Agha struck a calmer tone, saying he leaves it to individuals to express themselves.India, eight-time champions and defending title-holders, will be looking to extend their dominance.",Tickets for India vs Pakistan Asia Cup clash are still available.

NEW DELHI: Abhishek Sharma stole the spotlight as India began their 2025 Men’s Asia Cup campaign with a stunning nine-wicket win over the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. The left-handed opener, alongside Shubman Gill, made light work of a modest target in just 27 balls, orchestrating India’s fastest chase in men’s T20I history.The match swung India’s way early, thanks to brilliant bowling from Kuldeep Yadav and Shivam Dube. Kuldeep’s four-wicket haul (4-7) and Dube’s three wickets (3-4) bundled out UAE for a mere 57 in 13.1 overs — a total the UAE would rue for months. This low score set the stage for Abhishek to unleash his power-hitting skills.From the first ball, Abhishek was aggressive. He lofted Haider Ali over long-off for a six, immediately asserting dominance, before slicing the spinner for a boundary.Gill, making a return to the T20I squad after more than a year, contributed with 20 not out, including a flick over square leg for a six. But it was Abhishek who kept the scoreboard ticking with dazzling strokes, including a back-foot six over long-off against Dhruv Parashar and a crisp four over extra cover.Even after a miscued pull to mid-on ended his innings, he had already set the tone for a statement chase.Abhishek now joins the elite list of Indian batters to hit a six off the first ball of a T20I innings, alongside Rohit Sharma Yashasvi Jaiswal , and Sanju Samson.Skipper Suryakumar Yadav added a swish over fine leg for six, and Gill finished with a boundary past mid-on to seal the emphatic victory. India chased the target in just 4.3 overs, eclipsing their previous record of 6.3 overs against Scotland in the 2021 Men’s T20 World Cup, also in Dubai.For UAE, it was an evening to forget. Their batters struggled against India’s relentless bowling, and their bowlers couldn’t contain Abhishek, Gill, and Suryakumar. Abhishek’s explosive start and commanding presence at the crease not only set the tone for India’s campaign but also sent a clear message to their Asia Cup rivals: India’s top order is in imperious form.India now head into their next group matches against Pakistan and debutants Oman, having made a resounding statement in Dubai.","India beat the United Arab Emirates by nine wickets in Dubai.

Brief scores:

Bangladesh began their Asia Cup 2025 campaign with a seven-wicket win over Hong Kong on Thursday, producing a balanced performance with both ball and bat to secure victory with 14 balls to spare.Asked to bowl first, Litton Das’s side put Hong Kong under pressure early. Taskin Ahmed removed opener Anshuman Rath for four, while Tanzim Hasan Sakib followed up with the dismissal of Babar Hayat, bowling him for 14 just after he had struck a straight six. With both openers back in the pavilion, Hong Kong stumbled to 34 for two inside the powerplay.Zeeshan Ali (30 off 34) tried to stabilise the innings, striking a six over extra cover off Rishad Hossain, but he too fell before the 12th over, edging Mustafizur Rahman.Captain Yasim Murtaza injected some momentum with a 19-ball 28, highlighted by a pick-up shot off Tanzim that cleared the ropes, but Bangladesh’s attack remained disciplined. Rishad (2/31), Tanzim (2/21) and Taskin (2/38) kept the scoring rate in check, and Hong Kong eventually managed 143 for seven in their 20 overs.In reply, Bangladesh lost Parvez Hossain Emon for 19 after a brisk start but Litton Das anchored the chase with a composed half-century.Runs dried up briefly after the powerplay, with Bangladesh enduring a 33-ball stretch without a boundary.However, Das broke the shackles with a slog-swept six off Murtaza before raising his fifty with a couple. That over alone fetched 16 runs, shifting the momentum firmly in Bangladesh’s favour.Das’s 59 off 39 balls, with his classy strokeplay on display, set the platform for Towhid Hridoy to close out the chase. Hridoy remained unbeaten on 35 off 36 deliveries, adding 95 runs with his captain for the third wicket. Das fell before the finish, but Hridoy hit the winning run to complete the win in 17.4 overs.The result handed Hong Kong their second straight defeat in the tournament, while Bangladesh started their campaign on a convincing note under the leadership of Litton Das.Hong Kong 143/7 in 20 overs (Nizakat Khan 42, Zeeshan Ali 30; Tanzim Hasan Sakib 2/21, Rishad Hossain 2/31, Taskin Ahmed 2/38).

EXCLUSIVE | Harbhajan Singh on Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill, India vs Pakistan and more

MUMBAI: A few days before the traditional arch-rivals rake each other on in a league match of the 2025 Asia Cup in Dubai (on Sept 14), former Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh has reiterated his stance that India should avoid playing against Pakistan on the cricket field ""till relations between the countries get better.""This will be the first time that India and Pakistan clash in cricket since tensions rose after the Pahalgam attack on April 22, which was followed by India conducting ' Operation Sindoor .'Citing the example of how his team of ‘Indian Legends’ twice conceded its match against Pakistan recently, Harbhajan has asserted that India should boycott playing against Pakistan for the time being. ""The India-Pakistan match always comes in the limelight, but after 'Operation Sindoor,' everyone said there should be no cricket and no business (with Pakistan). We were playing the (World Championship of) Legends, we did not play that match (against Pakistan, in England). Everyone has their own way of thinking and understanding, but I feel till the time relations between the two countries do not improve, cricket and business should not be there, however, that is my thought.But if the government says the match can happen, it should happen but the relations between the two countries should be better,"" Harbhajan, accompanied by his wife Geeta Basra, said at an event here on Thursday evening.Harbhajan felt that India were the overwhelming favourites to win the Asia Cup, and expected the spinners to play a huge role in the tournament. ""If there is any team which can beat the Indian team, it is the Indian team itself, it is such a strong team. Our cricket is at a different level, the way we have made our name… even if Virat (Kohli) and Rohit (Sharma) are gone, the team is completely ready. Playing in Dubai is like playing at home and home turf. The role of the spinners will be huge and I hope the team brings the cup back,"" he said.Urging people to help Punjab, which has witnessed devastating floods in recent days due to excessive rain, Harbhajan, a Rajya Sabha MP who hails from Jalandhar, said, ""I was there in Punjab recently, and I saw with my own eyes what disaster the floods have caused in Punjab. The water level had one up to 12 feet. After the water recedes, the farmers of Punjab will need help in growing the crop again, as the soil has been left badly damaged due to the floods. The Punjabi people have this spirit and trait of standing up for whoever is in trouble, not just their own people. Today, Punjab is facing this disaster, a lot of people have been affected, a lot of farms have been affected. I would have been nothing if not for Punjab. Your support is important, it can be of any kind. We need to help the farmers in Punjab. I urge all of you to pitch in with any kind of help possible for Punjab""",Harbhajan Singh says India should avoid playing against Pakistan until relations improve. India and Pakistan will play in a league match of the 2025 Asia Cup in Dubai. The match will be the first since tensions rose after the Pahalgam attack on April 22.

India Asia Cup prediction: Why bad news could be in store for India | Greenstone Lobo predicts

NEW DELHI: The countdown to the Asia Cup 2025 blockbuster between India and Pakistan has taken an explosive turn, with former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi reigniting controversy just days before the Dubai showdown. The high-stakes clash on Sunday marks the first cricketing encounter between the two countries after the Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor, making it more politically charged than ever.Even as a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court sought cancellation of the fixture, the bench of Justices JK Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi on Thursday declined to interfere, ensuring the contest will go ahead as scheduled.But Afridi’s remarks on Pakistan television have stirred fresh debate. Revisiting the cancellation of the India Champions vs Pakistan Champions match in the World Championship of Legends (WCL) earlier this year, Afridi lashed out at former Indian players who pulled out.“I have always said that cricket should go on; it has always helped in making the relations better between the two countries. In England, people had bought tickets to see the WCL match, and the players had practised.Then you didn’t play. What was the thinking? I just can’t understand,” Afridi told Samaa TV.He doubled down on his infamous “bad egg” jibe aimed at Shikhar Dhawan , saying: “If I name any player, then their lives would be made hard. The player I referred to as a bad egg, his captain also told him, ‘If you don’t want to play, then don’t play. Just don’t tweet on social media.’ But that said, the player had come with an ulterior motive. That is why he was a bad egg.”Afridi also alleged that certain ex-players remain desperate to assert their nationality. “There are plenty of issues in India. Some people reach the houses of players and threaten to burn them down. Certain players are still trying to prove they are Indian. They have been displaying this ever since being born. Now they are doing commentary in the Asia Cup,” he said.With emotions already running high and Afridi’s comments fanning the flames, Sunday’s India-Pakistan clash in Dubai promises to be one of the most emotionally charged encounters in Asia Cup.",Shahid Afridi reignites controversy just days before the Dubai showdown.

India ODI captain Rohit Sharma ’s return to the nets has set social media abuzz, but it was a comment from his wife Ritika Sajdeh that has been getting all the love.On Thursday, Rohit shared a video of his training session on Instagram, marking his preparation for the upcoming ODI series against Australia. The clip, featuring a montage of his trademark strokes, carried the caption ""That felt good. ” Within hours, the post had drawn over a million likes.While fans rushed to express their excitement, Ritika’s comment stood out for its emotional touch. “Goosebumps and”, she wrote with teary-eyed emojis summing up the mood of supporters eager to see the 38-year-old opener back in international colours.Rohit has been out of international action since India’s ICC Champions Trophy victory earlier this year, having announced his retirement from Test cricket in May. His hospital visit earlier this week sparked some concern, but he later cleared a fitness test at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru, paving the way for his return.India will take on Australia in a three-match ODI series starting October 19 at Optus Stadium in Perth. With Rohit and Virat Kohli now solely focused on the 50-over format, the upcoming series carries added significance for India’s limited-overs setup.For fans, however, the comeback has already begun off the field. Ritika’s reaction to the viral video summed up the anticipation, and the personal support surrounding Rohit’s much-awaited return.The video also had a rather light-hearted comment from Herschelle Gibbs, where he wrote, ""Good job kepke"".

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: 'I will message you Playing XI', and more on India preparations

Poll Do you think Suryakumar Yadav made the right decision by withdrawing the run-out appeal? Yes, it shows true sportsmanship No, he should have gone for the appeal

NEW DELHI: India began their Asia Cup 2025 campaign with a dominant nine-wicket victory over UAE in Dubai on Wednesday, but it was an act of sportsmanship from skipper Suryakumar Yadav that stole the spotlight. Veteran India batter Ajinkya Rahane lauded Suryakumar for withdrawing a run-out appeal against Junaid Siddique, calling it a decision that reflected character and spirit.The incident occurred in the 13th over of UAE’s innings when Siddique stepped out of his crease while distracted by a towel falling from bowler Shivam Dube’s trousers. Sanju Samson capitalised with a direct hit, but Suryakumar chose to withdraw the appeal, allowing Siddique to continue.“It was a great call by Team India and captain Surya because Junaid was not looking for a run. I guess he was not aware of where the crease was,” Rahane said on his YouTube channel. “As a wicketkeeper or a fielder, when you get the ball in hand, your instinct is to aim at the stumps. But it was the right call made by Team India. They have shown great character and very good sportsman’s spirit. That’s what you want to see in cricket — you play hard, but you play fair.While the decision did not change the match outcome — UAE folded for 57 and India chased the target in just 4.3 overs — Rahane stressed that such gestures carry a bigger meaning for the game.The veteran batter also weighed in on team balance, notably the absence of left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh in the XI. India opted for Jasprit Bumrah as the frontline pacer, with Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube providing seam support.“Personally, I think this was a very well-balanced team,” Rahane said. “The only player missing was Arshdeep Singh, and I would love to see him in the playing XI bowling with Bumrah. Against quality opposition, India will need a quality fast bowler. If Hardik bowls in the powerplay, you need someone to bowl alongside Bumrah at the death. I’m sure Arshdeep will get a chance somewhere down the line in this tournament.”",Suryakumar Yadav withdraws run-out appeal against Junaid Siddique.

Central Zone skipper Rajat Patidar produced a moment of brilliance on Thursday with a sensational diving catch that instantly went viral on the opening day of the Duleep Trophy final against South Zone.The incident came in the 49th over of South’s innings when off-spinner Saransh Jain found extra bounce against Salman Nizar. The left-hander came forward and the ball struck his glove, bouncing towards silly point.Though the fielder couldn’t hold on, Patidar at gully reacted swiftly, diving forward to grab the rebound inches before it hit the turf.Patidar’s athletic effort capped a dominant day for Central, who bowled South out for 149 in just 63 overs. Jain returned with 5 for 49, while left-arm spinner Kumar Kartikeya claimed 4 for 53, sharing nine wickets between them. For South, opener Tanmay Agarwal’s 31 was the highest contribution in a faltering batting display.Having won the toss and chosen to field, Central justified their decision and gained the advantage with a solid start in reply. By stumps, openers Danish Malewar (28*) and Akshay Wadkar (20*) had guided their side to 50 without loss, leaving them only 99 runs behind.Patidar, who has already racked up 268 runs in three innings this season at an average of 68.33, will look to extend Central’s grip on the final when he comes out to bat.

Central Zone seized the early advantage in the Duleep Trophy final after spinners Saransh Jain and Kumar Kartikeya combined to dismantle South Zone for just 149 on Thursday. At stumps, Central were 50 without loss, reducing the deficit to 99 runs.Jain returned figures of 5 for 49, his ninth five-wicket haul in first-class cricket, while Kartikeya took 4 for 53. Together, they bowled 45 overs and capitalised on South’s lack of conviction at the crease.South’s troubles began in the 16th over when opener Mohit Kale (6) attempted an ill-judged sweep off Kartikeya and was bowled. From there, wickets fell steadily, leaving the side 64 for four at lunch. The dismissal of Tanmay Agarwal (31), run out after a mid-pitch collision with Ricky Bhui (15), proved especially costly.Skipper Mohammed Azharuddeen soon followed, undone by a delivery from Kartikeya that pitched on middle and clipped off stump. The post-lunch session offered little respite as indecision continued to plague the batting unit.Andre Siddarth’s dismissal highlighted that uncertainty. The Tamil Nadu batter, having played a neat flick earlier, misjudged the flight while charging Kartikeya and was stumped by Upendra Yadav, who showed sharp reflexes to gather a ball bouncing above his waist.Salman Nizar (24) attempted to hold the innings together but fell to Jain, his push producing an edge that was eventually snaffled by Rajat Patidar at gully after rebounding off silly point. Once Nizar departed, the innings folded quickly. Jain, who had taken 5 for 84 against West Zone in the semifinal, repeated the feat with another five-for.In contrast, Central’s openers Danish Malewar (28*) and Akshay Wadkar (20*) looked composed. They battled both pace and spin with calmness, building an unbeaten 50-run stand. Malewar impressed in particular, striking two boundaries off Gurjapneet Singh in one over.While South stumbled through a day of poor shot selection and uncertain play, Central’s confident start highlighted the massive gap between the sides, leaving them firmly in command heading into day two.","Central Zone bowled South Zone out for 149 in the Duleep Trophy final. Spinners Saransh Jain and Kumar Kartikeya took five wickets each.

Poll Should Shreyas Iyer replace Sanju Samson if he underperforms? Yes, it's a fair choice No, give him more chances

Former India captain and ex-national selector Kris Srikkanth has raised concerns over Sanju Samson’s role in the Asia Cup 2025, suggesting that the wicketkeeper-batter’s inclusion at No.5 could be a move to clear the path for Shreyas Iyer’s return to the T20I setup.With Shubman Gill named vice-captain and opening alongside Abhishek Sharma, Samson was slotted into the middle order. Before the clash against the United Arab Emirates (UAE), there was speculation that he might not even make the XI, with Jitesh Sharma tipped to feature instead. However, captain Suryakumar Yadav and head coach Gautam Gambhir stuck with Samson.Srikkanth, though, questioned the management’s thinking. “I somehow feel by making Sanju bat at 5, they are making way for Shreyas Iyer to return to the side. Sanju hasn’t batted much at 5, and he shouldn’t bat at that position either. It will dent his confidence batting at No. 5. I am not too happy for him,” he said on his YouTube channel.The former opener also warned that Samson’s opportunities may be limited. “To Sanju, I would warn him by saying that this is his last chance. I would also tell him if he fails to score in the next three innings at this position, Shreyas Iyer will replace him,” Srikkanth added.Samson, who has struck three T20I centuries in the past year, has far greater numbers as an opener than in the middle order. At No.5, his T20I record is 62 runs at an average of 20.62, compared to 522 runs as an opener.Srikkanth also questioned whether Samson is suited to finish off games. “They are playing Sanju Samson in the middle-order. Are they going to use him as the finisher? No. That’ll be Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube. So, Samson will play at 5. Will he deliver? That’s a question mark,” he said, before asking, “You’ve accommodated Sanju Samson ahead of Jitesh Sharma. It is fine for this Asia Cup, but what will happen in the T20 World Cup?”India began their campaign with a nine-wicket win over UAE, chasing down a target of 58 in just 4.3 overs. Their next fixture is against Pakistan on September 14 in Dubai.","Former India captain Kris Srikkanth has raised concerns over Sanju Samson’s role in the Asia Cup.

Poll Should Indian players focus solely on cricket during the Asia Cup? Yes, absolutely No, other factors matter

NEW DELHI: World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev has delivered a clear message to the Indian team ahead of their high-voltage Asia Cup clash against Pakistan in Dubai on Sunday — focus on cricket and block out external distractions.“The Indian players should stay focused solely on the game. They have a good team and must win,” Kapil told reporters. Emphasising the need to separate sport from politics, he added, “Players should concentrate only on their performance and not get distracted by anything else. Just go and win. The government will do its job, and the players should do theirs.”This will be India’s first meeting with Pakistan since Operation Sindoor, launched after the Pahalgam terror attack earlier this year that claimed 26 lives. The government has since reiterated its policy of avoiding bilateral sporting ties with Pakistan, though participation in multilateral events like the Asia Cup remains permitted.India, the reigning T20 world champions, opened their campaign with a commanding nine-wicket win over UAE on Wednesday. Kapil expressed confidence in the side’s form, saying: “It’s a good team, good luck, they won well yesterday. I hope they win the trophy too.”Meanwhile, across the border, former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif suggested that India’s decision to play Pakistan without hesitation has “killed the hype” of the contest. “Things get hyped when it is censored or there is any hurdle,” Latif told IANS. “The tickets are still selling in Dubai and this is the first time.”With contrasting views from two former greats, the stage is set for another marquee India-Pakistan battle. But Kapil’s message to Suryakumar Yadav ’s men is crystal clear — let the cricket do the talking.","World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev has delivered a clear message to the Indian team ahead of their high-voltage Asia Cup clash against Pakistan in Dubai on Sunday.

Poll Should the identities of individuals involved in such cases be kept confidential until proven guilty? Yes, to protect their rights. No, transparency is important.

Former Premier League referee David Coote has pleaded not guilty to a charge of making an indecent video of a child. The 43-year-old, from Newark, appeared before Nottingham Magistrates’ Court on Thursday.Coote, who was dismissed by referees’ body PGMOL in 2024, faces an accusation of making one “category A” video of a child on January 2, 2020. Category A offences are considered the most serious, involving acts such as downloading, sharing or saving indecent material.Ben Payne, prosecuting, told the court that the matter came to light during an FA investigation into Coote, when mobile devices were examined by a third party. He also added that following a police investigation, Coote was arrested at his home, where two laptops were seized, as per AFP. A video involving a 15-year-old child was subsequently found.Payne said that that the “starting point for sentencing was a year in custody” and said the case was suitable for Magistrates’ Court. However, Coote used his right for a jury trial and requested the matter be sent to Crown Court. A pre-trial hearing at Nottingham Crown Court has been set for October 9.Earlier, defence solicitor Fraser Williamson applied to restrict publication of Coote’s home address, citing safety concerns following threats he had received during his officiating career. District Judge Gillian Young rejected the application.Coote remains on bail under conditions that prohibit him from having unsupervised contact with anyone under 18 or residing in a household with a minor without approval.","Former Premier League referee David Coote has pleaded not guilty to a charge of making an indecent video of a child.

India’s U23 men’s national football team stamped their authority in Group H of the AFC U23 Asian Cup Qualifiers, routing Brunei Darussalam 6-0 at the Suheim Bin Hamad Stadium in Doha on Tuesday. The Blue Colts, already having beaten Bahrain 2-0 and narrowly losing to hosts Qatar 1-2, finished their campaign with six points, leaving qualification hopes dependent on other results.Midfielder Vibin Mohanan was the star of the show, scoring a rapid-fire hat-trick in the 5th, 7th, and 62nd minutes. Ayush Chhetri (41’) and Mohammed Aimen (87’, 90+7’) added three more for a comprehensive victory.India wasted no time asserting dominance, with Muhammed Suhail’s cutback setting up Vibin for the opener in the fifth minute, followed by a looping second goal that left Brunei goalkeeper helpless. A fine one-two between Chhetri and Sreekuttan MS set up India’s third, before Vibin completed his hat-trick with a curling free-kick in the second half. Aimen’s long-range strikes sealed the emphatic 6-0 win.However, the celebrations in Doha were overshadowed by security concerns.Several explosions were reported across the Qatari capital, with smoke rising over the Katara district. Israeli media cited senior officials, reporting that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israeli Security Agency (ISA) targeted senior Hamas leaders allegedly responsible for orchestrating attacks against Israel, including the October 7 strikes.The IDF stated that “precise munitions” were used with additional intelligence to minimise civilian casualties. Israeli Prime Minister confirmed full responsibility, while US President Donald Trump reportedly approved the operation, according to Israeli Channel 12.Despite the tense backdrop, India’s youngsters remained focused on the pitch, dominating Brunei with clinical finishing and controlled possession.

NEW DELHI: India etched their name in Central Asian football history on Monday, by securing a bronze medal in their maiden appearance at the CAFA Nations Cup. The Blue Tigers defeated higher-ranked Oman 3-2 on penalties after the third-place playoff ended 1-1 at the Hisor Central Stadium in Hisor, Tajikistan.The evening saw plenty of drama as Udanta Singh Kumam’s 80th-minute header cancelled out Jameel Al Yahmadi’s opener in the 55th minute, taking the contest into extra time. Oman were reduced to ten men when Ali Al Busaidi was sent off in the 96th minute, but despite India’s late dominance, the match went to a penalty shootout.In the shootout, Lallianzuala Chhangte, Rahul Bheke, and Jithin MS held their nerves to score for India, while Anwar Ali’s effort was saved and Udanta fired wide. For Oman, only Thani Al Rushaidi and Muhsen Al Ghassani converted, with Harib Al Saadi and Ahmed Al Kaabi missing the target. The decisive moment came when Indian skipper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu dived full stretch to save Al Yahmadi’s final kick, sparking wild celebrations as India sealed a historic podium finish.The match itself was an end-to-end affair. India began brightly, with Vikram Partap Singh and Chhangte troubling the Omani defence on the flanks.An early chance fell to defender Anwar Ali, whose powerful header was superbly saved by goalkeeper Ibrahim Al Mukhaini. Oman, however, responded through Issam Al Sabhi and Nasser Al Rawahi, testing Sandhu, who kept India in the contest with crucial saves.Oman struck first after the restart, when Abdullah Fawaz’s deft flick released Al Yahmadi to score at the far post. But head coach Khalid Jamil’s substitutions paid dividends, as Danish Farooq’s flick-on from Rahul Bheke’s long throw allowed Udanta to equalize with a brave header, confirmed after a lengthy VAR check.With Busaidi’s red card tilting the balance, India pressed for a winner in extra time but failed to break through. Ultimately, the night belonged to Sandhu, whose final save ensured India a remarkable third-place finish at their CAFA Nations Cup debut.",India secured a bronze medal in their maiden appearance at the CAFA Nations Cup.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

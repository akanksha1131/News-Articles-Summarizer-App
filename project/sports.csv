NEW DELHI: India’s white-ball captain Rohit Sharma has finally addressed questions surrounding his future in One Day Internationals (ODIs). In a candid conversation with senior journalist Vimal Kumar, Rohit made it clear that while he’s not done just yet, he’s very aware of when to walk away.The veteran opener emphasised his evolved approach to batting, saying, ""I used to play the way I used to, I took my time.Earlier, I would play 30 balls in the first 10 overs and be at just 10 runs. But if I play 20 balls now, why can't I score 30, 35, or even 40 runs? And on the days when I get going, hitting the accelerator, scoring 80 runs in the first 10 overs isn't bad at all.

Barring former England captain Jos Buttler and South Africa's speedster Gerald Coetzee, all the overseas players stayed back.""Our entire squad stuck around. Only Jos and Gerald, but they will come back as required,"" said the official.GT have looked like one of the favorites to win the title. They have three batters – Sai Sudharsan (509 runs), Shubman Gill (508 runs), and Jos Buttler (500 runs) – in the fray for the Orange Cap and in the top five leading run-getters. Prasidh Krishna, with 20 wickets at an impressive economy rate of 7.65, is leading the Purple Cap race.

NEW DELHI: Former England skipper Michael Vaughan has stirred discussion by backing Virat Kohli to lead India in the upcoming five-match Test series against England, starting June 20.Taking to social media platform X, Vaughan posted, ""If I was India I would give the captaincy to Virat for the Test series in England .. Shubman Gill can be his VC for the tour ..""Kohli, who stepped down from Test captaincy during the South Africa tour in 2021–22, has remained a central figure in India’s Test setup, even as he has refrained from leadership duties.According to a recent TimesofIndia.com report, the veteran batter has expressed a desire to retire from Test cricket and has communicated the same to the BCCI , raising questions about his long-term future in the format.Nevertheless, Vaughan’s endorsement reflects the belief in Kohli’s unmatched leadership pedigree, especially in challenging overseas conditions like England. Kohli is India’s most successful Test captain, with 40 wins in 68 matches. He has led India to memorable overseas wins and helped build one of the most aggressive and fit Test units.With 9230 runs from 123 Tests, including 30 centuries, Kohli continues to be a key figure in India’s red-ball ambitions.

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Rohit Sharma’s last press conference as a captain

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma ’s decision to step away from Test cricket has sparked widespread debate, and former cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar didn’t hold back when weighing in.Taking to his official ‘X’ handle, Manjrekar pointed to Rohit’s recent slump and waning fitness as key reasons why the decision made sense.“164 in his last 15 innings. Out of which 10 were at home v Bangladesh & NZ.Average 10.9. With his current fitness levels… Rohit Sharma’s days as Test opener were over. So…” Manjrekar posted, summarising his view with stark clarity.Rohit, 38, officially announced his Test retirement on Wednesday via Instagram. In a brief but heartfelt note, he wrote, “It’s been an absolute honour to represent my country in whites. Thank you for all the love and support over the years.”His exit comes at a time when his place in the Test squad was under scrutiny. With a five-match Test series against England looming and reports of potential leadership changes within the BCCI, the timing of his decision seemed inevitable.While Rohit bows out from the longest format, he remains committed to white-ball cricket. After leading India to T20 World Cup glory in 2024 and retiring from the format, he confirmed that he will continue playing ODIs.Despite finishing with an impressive Test career tally of 4,301 runs, 12 centuries, and a highest score of 212, his recent form had noticeably dipped.In his final nine matches, Rohit averaged just 10.93 and even dropped himself during the Sydney Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Away from the pitch, Rohit also took aim at the current state of cricket commentary in India, calling it “disappointing” in a candid interview.ALSO READ: 'It is very disappointing': Rohit Sharma not happy with Indian commentary standards He criticised the shift in focus from the game to sensationalism, highlighting a growing disconnect between the media and cricket itself.As he moves on from the whites, Rohit’s legacy—especially in white-ball formats—remains firmly intact.",Rohit Sharma announced his Test retirement on Wednesday.

IPL 2025 suspended: What happens next?

Foreign players jittery

Teams evacuated with ‘utmost secrecy’

Other domestic leagues also impacted

Mumbai: The remainder of IPL-2025 has been suspended for a week amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan. The decision followed a meeting of the IPL governing council and was taken in consultation with the Indian government.In a statement issued on Friday, BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia said, “The BCCI has decided to suspend the remainder of the ongoing IPL with immediate effect for one week.Further updates regarding the new schedule and venues will be announced in due course after a comprehensive assessment of the situation in consultation with relevant authorities and stakeholders.“The decision was taken by the IPL governing council after due consultation with all key stakeholders, including most franchisees who conveyed the concerns and sentiments of their players, as well as the views of the broadcaster, sponsors, and fans.“While the BCCI reposes full faith in the strength and preparedness of our armed forces, the board considered it prudent to act in the collective interest of all stakeholders.”A franchise official told TOI, “The BCCI has formally shared with us that the suspension will currently be for one week — during this time, the situation will be reviewed.”At this point, it is unclear whether the tournament will resume in India or abroad. The UAE, traditionally a fallback host, appears to be ruled out as the Pakistan Cricket Board announced that the remainder of the Pakistan Super League will be moved there. It later emerged, however, that the PSL may not get to relocate there.“Give the BCCI some time to decide,” said a top board official. “The easier option was to cancel or indefinitely postpone the IPL, but the BCCI, in consultation with the government, has taken a bold stand to resume the league soon.“Cancelling or delaying it indefinitely would’ve sent the wrong signal — that we are intimidated by the enemy and unsure of our own security capabilities.”In a strongly worded statement, the BCCI added, “At this critical juncture, the BCCI stands firmly with the nation. We express our solidarity with the government of India, the armed forces and the people of our country. The board salutes the bravery, courage, and selfless service of our armed forces, whose heroic efforts under Operation Sindoor continue to protect and inspire the nation, as they lead a resolute response to the recent terrorist attacks and the unwarranted aggression by Pakistan’s armed forces.“While cricket remains a national passion, there is nothing greater than the nation — its sovereignty, integrity, and security. The BCCI remains fully committed to supporting all efforts that safeguard India and will always align its decisions with the best interests of the nation.”Earlier in the day, the BCCI had informed franchises about the temporary suspension of the IPL. Many foreign players became uneasy after Thursday night’s developments, which saw Pakistan attacking areas close to the border, and expressed a desire to return home. The vulnerability of the tournament became clear when the match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamshala was abandoned midway for security reasons.The players and support staff of both teams, as well as the broadcast crew, were evacuated with “utmost secrecy” as the airport had been shut.The IPL suspension has now led to suspensions of other state leagues. On Friday, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) announced the postponement of its Bengal Pro T20 League Season 2. The Mumbai league, scheduled to begin on May 26, also faces uncertainty.“The situation is very unpredictable,” a source told TOI.",The remainder of IPL-2025 has been suspended for a week amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan.

We can never stop improving – be it batting, bowling or fielding.”Acknowledging the team's all-round effort, Harmanpreet praised the batting display. “Proud of the entire team, especially the batters. We wanted to bat first and pretty happy with how we played.”While Mandhana was named Player-of-the-Match for her hundred, Sneh Rana earned the Player-of-the-Series award for her 15 wickets.Harmanpreet highlighted the depth in the squad: “The way the other batters apart from Smriti and me performed was a big positive.

India delivered a commanding performance to clinch the Women’s Tri-Nation ODI series title with a resounding 97-run win over Sri Lanka in the final on Sunday. Vice-captain Smriti Mandhana starred with a sublime century, while the bowlers executed a clinical job to seal a deserving triumph.Opting to bat first, India rode on Mandhana’s masterful 116 off 101 balls — her 11th ODI hundred — to post a formidable 342/7.Battling cramps in humid conditions, the elegant left-hander peppered her innings with 15 boundaries and two sixes, including four consecutive fours off Sri Lanka skipper Chamari Athapaththu.Dropped on 21, Mandhana made Sri Lanka pay with crucial partnerships — 70 runs for the opening wicket with Pratika Rawal (30) and a 120-run stand with Harleen Deol (47) for the second wicket. Her fluent knock laid the foundation for India’s late-innings assault.Jemimah Rodrigues (44 off 29) and captain Harmanpreet Kaur (41 off 30) capitalised in the final phase, as India amassed 90 runs in the last 10 overs. Deepti Sharma (20* off 14) and Amanjot Kaur (18 off 12) added the finishing touches.For Sri Lanka, Sugandika Kumari (2/59), Dewmi Vihanga (2/69), and Malki Madara (2/74) shared the wickets but were unable to contain the Indian onslaught.Chasing 343, Sri Lanka’s innings faltered early with Hasini Perera bowled by Amanjot Kaur in the very first over. Athapaththu (51) and Vishmi Gunaratne (36) tried to revive the chase, but disciplined Indian bowling tightened the screws. Off-spinner Deepti Sharma applied pressure with three tight overs, paving the way for Amanjot to bowl Vishmi around her legs.Sneh Rana (4/38) then struck key blows, including the wicket of Athapaththu just after her half-century. Rana had earlier dropped the Sri Lankan skipper but made amends quickly. Nilakshika Silva (48) offered resistance, but her dismissal to Rana marked the end of any hope for the hosts.India wrapped up the innings for 245, with Amanjot (3/54) and Rana leading the bowling effort in a dominant all-round display.",India beat Sri Lanka by 97 runs to win the Women's Tri-Nation ODI series.

NEW DELHI: Alexander Sorloth netted four goals during the initial half-hour period, guiding Atletico Madrid towards a commanding 4-0 triumph against Real Sociedad in La Liga on Saturday.The Norwegian striker's quartet of goals ensured Atletico strengthened their position in third, whilst La Real dropped to 12th spot.Sorloth achieved his hat-trick within the first 11 minutes, setting a new La Liga record.This surpassed previous achievements from 1929 and 1941, when Europa's Carles Bestit and Valencia's Mundo scored their trebles by the 15th minute.Diego Simeone , Atletico's manager, has typically utilised Sorloth as a substitute this season. However, the 29-year-old demonstrated his capabilities when given a starting role with an impressive opening display.The ex-Real Sociedad forward dismantled his former club, opening his account at seven minutes with a precise finish from Pablo Barrios' delivery.Three minutes later, Sorloth struck again, sending a powerful shot from the box's edge beyond Alex Remiro's reach.His third goal, arriving in the 11th minute, resulted from poor Real Sociedad defending, allowing him an easy finish from close range.The 30th minute saw Sorloth complete his scoring spree, converting Javi Galan's low cross with authority.Previously, Villarreal sustained their Champions League qualification pursuit with a narrow 1-0 victory at Girona.The Yellow Submarine, positioned fifth with five teams qualifying, secured three points through Karl Etta Eyong's 89th-minute header at Montilivi against struggling Girona.The Catalan side were without their manager Michel Sanchez, who remains in hospital for observation as a ""precaution"", according to Girona's Friday announcement, regarding an unspecified condition.Despite controlling proceedings, Villarreal only broke through when Alfonso Pedraza's cross found Cameroon-born midfielder Eyong.The win places Villarreal alongside fourth-placed Athletic Bilbao on 61 points, maintaining a four-point advantage over sixth-placed Real Betis, who face Osasuna on Sunday.Mallorca, ninth-placed, maintained their European qualification hopes by defeating relegated Real Valladolid 2-1.Sunday's fixture sees league leaders Barcelona confront second-placed Real Madrid in a crucial Clasico that could determine the Spanish championship outcome.","Atletico Madrid defeated Real Sociedad 4-0 in La Liga on Saturday.

Manchester City 's hopes of securing a Champions League berth took a minor hit on Saturday after a frustrating 0-0 draw with relegated Southampton at St Mary's Stadium. Despite dominating possession and registering 26 shots — only five of which were on target — City failed to find the net, even with star striker Erling Haaland back in action.The draw leaves Pep Guardiola's side third in the Premier League table, four points clear of sixth-placed Nottingham Forest, who still have a game in hand.City missed the opportunity to draw level with Arsenal on 67 points, as their title defence continues to fade following a difficult winter period Guardiola has called his “most challenging season in 16 years.”While Champions League qualification remains likely, City's inability to break down a struggling Southampton side raised questions about their attacking edge. Saints, who had taken just two points from their previous 11 matches, did manage to avoid an unwanted record — moving to 12 points for the season and thereby eclipsing Derby's all-time low of 11 from the 2007/08 campaign.Elsewhere, Brentford and Brighton boosted their European ambitions. Brentford edged Ipswich 1-0 thanks to Kevin Schade's 11th league goal, moving into eighth place, a position that may offer a route into Europe. Brighton, level on points with Brentford, beat Wolves 2-0 with goals from Danny Welbeck and Brajan Gruda.Everton secured Premier League survival with a spirited 3-1 comeback against Fulham.Meanwhile, Aston Villa, Newcastle, and Liverpool will look to keep their Champions League hopes alive across the weekend, with Villa hosting Bournemouth and Newcastle set to face Chelsea.

The Jaguar TCS Racing driver confessed he was actually “jumping up and down” on the inside as he reached the podium for the first time this season. However, it is his third consecutive podium at the Monaco E-Prix, his home race. A day after the race, Cassidy made multiple attempts to at least share a post to mark his first Formula E win of the year before finally dropping a bunch of stunning pictures on his Instagram page.Nick Cassidy shared a picture of himself holding the trophy at the Monaco E-Prix Round 7 on Instagram on Monday, along with several stunning pictures of his family and more. He wrote, “Not on here much these days.. No other way around it - been a super tough start to the year and it’s great to have an awesome Podium in Monaco with @jaguarracing. 3 years in a row on the steps at home is super special. Thanks to all those in my corner.”Just before dropping the post, he took to his Instagram Stories to share a screenshot of his many attempts at making an Instagram post to assure his followers that he was trying to share at least one post on the special occasion.Nick had won the Monaco E-Prix once in 2023 when he was racing for Envision Racing and had taken the second podium spot in 2024 with Jaguar TCS Racing. Nick Cassidy picked his way through the field from 14th position on the grid to third spot on the podium in the Monaco E-Prix Round 7. He capitalised on a strong energy advantage built early on in the race to yield late progress as he neared the finish line and ended third.Sharing his first reaction after the race, Nick Cassidy said: “It feels very very sweet. I can’t fault my guys - it’s been an extremely tough start to the year, it’s no secret I’ve not been the happiest guy at times, but this one feels like a big monkey off the shoulders and I’m really proud of everyone’s efforts. On the inside I’m jumping up and down, I’m very very happy - it doesn’t get more special than here. Obviously the last couple of years have been nice to us here and it’s super special to carry that on.”Also Read: Monaco E-Prix Round 7 results: Sebastien Buemi clinches third Monaco win, Oliver Rowland and Nick Cassidy join him on podium Cassidy is currently in the 13th position in the Formula E driver standings with 25 points.

Oliver Rowland couldn’t translate his pole into victory in Monaco Round 7





There is no stopping Oliver Rowland , who had double gains at the recently held Monaco E-Prix double-header and is “really pleased” with his position in Round 7. The Nissan driver won Round 6 and had said, “Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne, but you’ve already got one eye on tomorrow.” He did keep the champagne celebrations under control after his win in Monaco and yielded results with his podium finish the next day.Oliver Rowland had won the pole position and was confidently leading in the first half of the race, but as if the pole curse continues to be in place ever since 2022, he couldn’t manage to cross the finish line first. It was Envision Racing’s Sébastien Buemi who ended his more than six-year-long wait for a win by lifting the winner’s trophy on Day 2 of the Monaco E-Prix. Only António Félix da Costa had managed to translate his pole into a victory at the Formula E Monaco race in 2021.Sharing his take on the Monaco race, Rowland said, “I think honestly when he [Buemi] took his Attack Mode, he knew I had more to do — I think he was trying to back me into the pack, so when I took it, I lost quite a lot. But, first and second here doesn’t get much better, so I’m really, really pleased. We just need to keep pushing. We’ve got Tokyo next week where I was really strong last year, so hopefully we can have a real big push for that double-header and then keep pushing in the right direction.”Many believed Rowland was in his own race as he took a three-second lead in the first half. However, he lunged at the chicane on Lap 21, and it was Buemi who surpassed him at the right time. The Nissan driver's move was later judged over-exuberant by the stewards, forcing him to cede the position to Jean-Éric Vergne in recompense, but the damage cost the DS Penske driver a crack at the race win, as Mahindra Racing's Nyck de Vries and Buemi made it by as Vergne bogged down in avoiding action.Rowland once again gave up the lead to Vergne as he took his final mandatory 50kW, four-wheel drive Attack Mode activation, to use that overlap of extra power and traction to push past Vergne and de Vries on Laps 23 and 24 respectively, for second place at the flag, some four seconds back from Buemi.Also Read: Monaco E-Prix Round 6 winner Oliver Rowland delays celebrations for Round 7: “Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne but…” Up next is the Tokyo double-header on May 17 and 18.

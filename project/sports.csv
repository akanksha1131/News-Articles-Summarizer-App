India XI for the fourth Test:

Sam Konstas , 19, made a remarkable Test debut at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , becoming only the second player to hit two sixes off Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah in a single Test innings. This came after Australia won the toss and elected to bat in the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .Konstas displayed an aggressive and fearless approach from the moment he stepped onto the field. He immediately targeted Bumrah, showcasing his intent to make an impact.After surviving a maiden over, Konstas quickly seized the initiative. He executed a reverse ramp shot, sending Bumrah's delivery over the wicketkeeper for a boundary.Konstas's aggressive approach continued. He followed up with a stunning reverse scoop for six, sailing over the slip fielders. This audacious shot was noteworthy as it marked the first six conceded by Bumrah in Test cricket after 4483 balls or since 2021.Konstas continued his assault on Bumrah, adding another six in the 11th over. This made him only the second player, after England's Jos Buttler, to hit two sixes off Bumrah in a single Test innings.Konstas's batting showcased not just power but also precise timing and accuracy. His mature and fearless approach belied his young age, suggesting he is well-suited to the demands of Test cricket.Konstas received his Test debut cap from former Australian captain Mark Taylor. This marked a significant milestone in his career. At 19 years and 85 days old, he became the fourth youngest Australian to debut in Test cricket.Konstas joins a select group of young Australian Test debutants. He follows Ian Craig, the youngest ever at 17 years and 239 days.

MELBOURNE: Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill , India's next rung of elite batters, have found support from their captain after a string of poor scores. While Jaiswal has fallen away after a fine century in Perth and got out to soft dismissals off Mitchell Starc and Scott Boland, there have been questions raised over Gill's technique following his inability to convert starts. Rohit Sharma , however, said it would be unwise to tinker with their mindset and technique at this stage of their careers.""Gill, Jaiswal, they're both in the same boat. You don't want to be telling Jaiswal too many things about his batting. He has come here for the first time and already shown what he's capable of. You don't want to tamper too much with his mindset. Let him be as free as possible and not overburdened with too many thoughts regarding his batting. He understands his batting more than any of us. It's about trying to figure out certain areas of his game."" Rohit said, adding, ""Every venue here has different challenges. It's about adapting. The bowlers are the same. They've got four seamers and one offspinner. It's about understanding what they usually do and what their plans are against certain batters.""Gill, meanwhile, has struggled overseas. Since the 91 against Australia in Brisbane in 2021, he has not crossed 40 in 16 innings in Tests played in New Zealand, England, Australia, West Indies and South Africa.""Both innings in Adelaide, I thought Gill looked pretty good. He just didn't convert that start into a big score. I'm not going to look too much into Brisbane, he got out early,"" Rohit said. ""These tours can be challenging. It's not that easy to put on those big runs every time you step out. Gill has quality. It's just about backing that quality. Like Jaiswal, we don't want to complicate too many things with him.""Rohit, who has hit a horror patch of form himself, seems fit to play after injuring his knee during training earlier. On Tuesday, he pleased crowds at the open nets but seemed displeased when asked if he would continue to bat in the middle order. ""Let's not worry about that. Who bats where is something we need to figure out among ourselves. It's not a thing I should be discussing at every press conference, where I'm batting.""","Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill are India's next rung of elite batters.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Why R Ashwin retirement was a last minute surprise for Ravindra Jadeja

NEW DELHI: After former India captain Kapil Dev voiced his dissatisfaction over Ravichandran Ashwin not being given a grand farewell, the recently-retired player reckons otherwise, saying he doesn't believe in grand farewell ceremonies.Ashwin stunned the cricketing world midway through the Border-Gavaskar Trophy by announcing his retirement from international cricket at the end of third Test in Brisbane last week.""I wish I had been there, I wouldn't have let him go like that. I would have sent him with a lot of respect and happiness,"" Kapil told ANI.However, Ashwin expressed that grand farewells are inappropriate, stating that such send-offs cater more to a culture of super celebrity worship.""As far as I am concerned, grand farewells are wrong. I don't think you should give grand farewell ceremonies to anyone. Especially, I firmly believe that you shouldn't give me a grand farewell. I don't want anyone shedding a drop of tear for me. I think grand send-offs are part of a super celebrity culture,"" Ashwin told television presenter Gobinath on a YouTube show.Why should we run behind someone? I understand we run behind someone for the love we have for them. But I feel that people should get inspired by one's achievements, the legacy that one leaves behind, the way one left the game, and the way one has spoken about the game. But farewells are wrong, I think. If there is a match that has been organised just to celebrate me, I think it's a disservice to the game,"" Ashwin added.""I don't have any regrets about it. Zero regrets. If I am not happy with 537 wickets, then for what will I be happy? Why should I be sad about something that's not there? There is great joy in acceptance. You chase something that you don't have. But don't regret something that you don't have. Don't crib about it.""Ashwin insisted that the call to retire was entirely his own decision and that he did not shed a single tear on his final day as international cricketer.Ashwin clarified that the decision to retire from the game was entirely his own, emphasising that no one else was responsible for it.""I quit this part of my life. It was a full stop to that part of my life. I can talk cricket, I do YouTube, I love coaching. I can keep myself happy around cricket. I will stay connected with cricket.""I don't have any regrets; I am not angry at anyone. I didn't cry even one bit. No one else is responsible for my retirement.

Rohit Sharma: 'Virat Kohli is a modern day great. He will figure it out'

Pat Cummins reveals Australia's XI for Boxing Day Test

NEW DELHI: With the Boxing Day Test set to begin at iconic MCG on Thursday, all eyes are on Virat Kohli , who seeks to overcome his recent batting struggles in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy .In his recent five innings, Kohli's performance has been inconsistent, with scores fluctuating between 5, 100 not out, 7, 11, and 3. His overall series statistics show a modest accumulation of 126 runs, resulting in an average of 31.50.The batting maestro, renowned for his resilience and class, faces the challenge of delivering on a stage where he has previously shone. Kohli’s form has been under scrutiny, but the MCG has often been a ground where greats have rediscovered their spark.Kohli's record at the Melbourne Cricket Ground spans across three Test matches, during which he has accumulated 316 runs in six innings. At the MCG, his batting statistics showcase remarkable consistency, with an outstanding average of 52.66.His finest performance at this historic venue was an exceptional knock of 169, which stands as his highest score and remains a significant milestone in his career at this ground. Beyond his hundred, Kohli's record includes two fifties at this ground.Former India head coach Ravi Shastri recently shared his thoughts about cricketers like Virat Kohli. He emphasised that such players never truly experience a dip in form, suggesting that they simply need to display patience and determination at the crease.""I think the same with Virat. If Virat gets over that first 30, 40 minutes, with serious application and discipline, I don't think he's (out of form), none of these guys are out of form,"" Shastri said in the ICC Review.Australian batting great Matthew Hayden also advised Kohli to learn from Sachin Tendulkar 's composed innings at 2004 Sydney Test and control his instinct to play away from his body, particularly outside the off-stump. This approach, Hayden suggests, could help Kohli return to form in the final two matches of the ongoing series.""I know he (Kohli) has a magnificent cover drive, but so did Sachin Tendulkar, and he put it away for a day. I sat in the gully licking my lips, thinking, you know what, this is magnificent, stubborn batting,"" Hayden told Star Sports.Against a fierce bowling attack and under the weight of expectations, Kohli’s ability to adapt and anchor the innings will be critical. Fans hope the festive Test reignites the run-machine’s fire and silences his critics.","Virat Kohli's form has been inconsistent in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

The Border-Gavaskar Trophy is at a crucial point, tied at 1-1, as India prepares for the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. Numerous selection challenges have emerged following the drawn third Test at the Gabba.Ravichandran Ashwin's unexpected retirement after the Gabba Test has created a significant gap in the Indian squad. His tactical acumen and exceptional spin bowling will be missed.Tanush Kotian, a young off-spinning all-rounder, has been chosen to replace Ashwin. This marks a fresh start for India's spin bowling attack.Nitish Kumar Reddy 's position in the playing XI is a major talking point. Some suggest replacing Reddy with Washington Sundar for an extra spin option. However, Sunil Gavaskar disagrees.“They can’t drop Nitish Kumar Reddy. He is the fourth seamer. I can’t see India going in with just two pacers and Nitish. For me, it is pretty much this XI that plays in Melbourne,” Gavaskar told Star Sports.Reddy's bowling performance in the series has been underwhelming, although he's a dependable lower-order batsman. Gavaskar believes Reddy's potential for crucial breakthroughs and batting contributions are essential for the team's balance.Changes at the top of the batting order are also being considered. Rohit Sharma might return to his preferred opening position.This would necessitate adjustments to the middle order. K.L. Rahul could bat at number three, replacing Shubman Gill.Gill, who hasn't performed well, might move down to number four or be replaced by Dhurv Jurel.India's pace bowling attack is another area of discussion. Akash Deep, whose batting heroics helped India avoid the follow-on at the Gabba, is expected to keep his place.“Unlikely that Harshit will replace Akash Deep. Why would you drop a man who has saved your team from follow-on?” Gavaskar stated.","The Border-Gavaskar Trophy is at a crucial point, tied at 1-1, as India prepares for the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne.

Tottenham Hotspur manager, Ange Postecoglou , anticipates squad reinforcements during the upcoming January transfer window. The team has recently faced challenges with injuries and suspensions, impacting their performance in the Premier League Despite these setbacks, Postecoglou remains committed to his attacking style of play. This approach has contributed to both thrilling victories and disappointing losses in recent matches.Last week's League Cup quarter-final win against Manchester United , ending 4-3, highlighted the team's attacking prowess. However, this was followed by a heavy 6-3 defeat against Liverpool in the league.Postecoglou confirmed his intention to strengthen the squad in January, ahead of the Boxing Day fixture against Nottingham Forest.""Like I said a while ago, we've been planning,"" he told a pre-match press conference.""A lot of it was going to be around where we're at around this time. Fair to say we're still a little bit short in a couple of areas and we need to reinforce.""Tottenham's continued involvement in multiple competitions necessitates squad depth. Postecoglou pointed out the demands of the Carabao Cup, European competition, and the FA Cup.""I think the fact that, obviously, we're still in the Carabao (League) Cup semi-final, still got Europe, FA Cup, we're in all the competitions, it's not like our schedule's going to ease up at any stage.""""So, I think it makes sense. We will try and reinforce. Where and what number we'll have to wait and see.""You don't just want to panic and bring in anybody that you don't think will help our cause in the back half of the year, but I think we've already shown we are pretty methodical and prudent about our work.""Tottenham's recent league form has seen three losses in their last five matches. They currently sit in 11th place in the Premier League table.The team has been juggling league fixtures with cup competitions. They are also managing a substantial injury list, which includes key players such as Guglielmo Vicario, Cristian Romero, and Micky van de Ven.Postecoglou expressed his appreciation for the players who have stepped up during this challenging period. He acknowledged the effort required to implement his demanding playing style.""I can't be critical of this group of players at the moment in any sense,"" he said.""I think it would be unfair for anyone to because what they're doing is they're giving absolute maximum effort.""That's backed up by the physical parameters you put against what they're doing. They're trying to do it in the way that I'm asking them to.""So how can I be critical of that? I think that would be hypocritical of me. The players are doing their part.""They're doing it to the maximum of their ability and it's a credit to them.""Postecoglou also shared his plans for a solitary Christmas Day, a familiar occurrence throughout his managerial career. He mentioned his family's location and his plans to connect with them.""It's a family tradition mate that I'm on my own,"" he said.

Chelsea hold second position in the Premier League , but their manager Enzo Maresca remains grounded, emphasising on Tuesday his focus on team development rather than title discussions.With 35 points, Chelsea trail Liverpool by four points and are scheduled for a West London derby against Fulham on Thursday.The weekend's goalless encounter with Everton prevented Chelsea from claiming the top spot, whilst ending their impressive streak of eight consecutive victories across all competitions and five successive Premier League wins.""We are ahead of our expectation in terms of the way we are playing and points. For us, the main focus is to see how we can improve the players and how we can improve the team,"" Maresca told reporters.""It's the reality for me, not about the pressure (of going for the title). I would like that kind of pressure. I say we are not there because that is the reality for me. The main point is to continue to improve and to win games.""Despite maintaining an eight-point advantage over struggling champions Manchester City , who occupy seventh place, Maresca believes Guardiola's team could still recover in the title race.""It's almost halfway so the table reflects the teams and where they are. Liverpool are doing fantastic since the first day,"" Maresca said.""...I think Manchester City in the end will be there. They are living something that probably never happened before. They have a new injury at the end of every game. It is a very bad situation.""Chelsea's defensive lineup remains affected by long-term injuries to Wesley Fofana and Benoit Badiashile.Maresca confirmed Romeo Lavia's absence for Thursday's match due to an ongoing thigh injury.Additionally, Mykhailo Mudryk faces suspension following an adverse analytical finding in an anti-doping test, though the Ukrainian maintains he has not knowingly consumed any prohibited substances.","Enzo Maresca says Chelsea's focus is on team development rather than title race.

Everton manager Sean Dyche emphasizes that his team won't underestimate Manchester City, despite the reigning champions' recent struggles.Everton's form has improved significantly. They've lost only twice in their last 12 matches after a difficult start to the season.Manchester City, accustomed to success, has experienced a dip in form. The four-time consecutive Premier League winners have lost nine of their last 12 games leading into the Boxing Day match against Everton.""They (City) have enjoyed so much success under Pep (Guardiola) over the years that everybody seems to be under this impression that it's when, not if, it turns back,"" said Dyche.Dyche acknowledges City's dominance under Pep Guardiola and the expectation of their eventual return to form. He also recognizes the rarity of such a challenging period for a manager like Guardiola.""I don't know all of Pep's history, but I think it's unlikely he's had too many spells like this.""Dyche acknowledges Guardiola’s exceptional track record, labelling him ""arguably one of the best ever."" The Everton manager views City's current struggles as a testament to the Premier League's competitiveness.""You'd think at some point it happens, even to the best, and he is arguably one of the best ever, but for him to have a testing period actually shows how tough the game is even for the top sides.""Dyche points out that even the best teams are susceptible to difficulties if they don't maintain attention to detail. He emphasizes that Everton are also working on improving their performance.""The details, even for the top teams, if you don't get them right, then things don't work out for you. They'll be trying to correct that.""Everton, while improving, still aims to increase their win count and goal tally. Dyche stresses the importance of a strong performance against City. He dismisses the notion of an easy win simply due to City's current form.""We're in the process of correcting somewhat what we were doing. We still need to win more games, obviously, and score more goals.""Dyche emphasizes the need for a determined and robust performance from his side. He acknowledges the quality of City’s players and manager despite their recent struggles.""It's not like you go there and think, 'We're going to win just because'.

Manchester City 's poor performance, with just one victory in eight Premier League matches, is a collective team issue rather than an individual's fault, according to manager Pep Guardiola 's statement on Tuesday. He emphasised that striker Erling Haaland should not be singled out for criticism.The champions' current position at seventh place, trailing Liverpool by 12 points, has coincided with Haaland's reduced scoring rate. After netting 10 goals in the initial five matches, the Norwegian has only scored twice during this difficult period.""It's about us, it's not just about one player,"" Guardiola told a press conference ahead of Thursday's game with Everton .""So when in the past we scored goals and Erling was so prolific in helping us, it's because of the team. And when you have problems at the back, in the middle, it's for everyone.""If it was just one player, the reason why, it would be easy. It's not about that. Erling is so important for us, will be so important for us, has been, and we try to do the things better, to use him better.""The availability of John Stones , Matheus Nunes and Ederson remains uncertain for the Everton fixture. Despite being unable to identify a specific cause for their recent struggles, Guardiola expressed confidence about an improvement in results soon.Regarding their current difficulties, Guardiola addressed various aspects affecting the team's performance, acknowledging that multiple factors have contributed to their decline in form. He emphasised the importance of upcoming matches as opportunities for improvement.Everton, despite being 15th in the table and 11 points behind City, has demonstrated strong defensive capabilities with five clean sheets in their previous six matches.Guardiola praised Sean Dyche 's tactical approach, particularly highlighting Everton's defensive organisation and effectiveness in transitions.With the Boxing Day fixture approaching, City's players will have limited family time during Christmas.

Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola is emphasizing the need for his team to maintain their strong performance at both ends of the field. He believes this is key to continuing their positive start to the Premier League season.The Cherries recently secured a 3-0 victory against Manchester United at Old Trafford , extending their unbeaten streak in the Premier League to five games. This impressive run has placed them fifth in the league standings.However, the upcoming busy Christmas and New Year period will challenge their squad depth. Their holiday campaign kicks off with a home match against Crystal Palace on Thursday.""I want to be as efficient as we can,"" said Iraola as per AFP.Iraola stressed the importance of replicating their performance against Manchester United. He acknowledged that maintaining this level consistently will be challenging.""If we can continue with the level in both boxes that we had on Sunday, it will be much easier -- but this is not a guarantee.""He expressed confidence in the team's ability to perform well as long as they continue creating opportunities and maintaining their current level of play.""As long as we continue creating chances and having the performances we are having, I think we will be fine.""Iraola also admitted that sustaining this consistency over an extended period is easier said than done.""This is easy to say -- but it is not easy to keep this consistency during a long period.""Bournemouth's impressive form has sparked hopes of European football amongst their fans. However, Iraola remains grounded and refuses to get carried away by the current league standings.He highlighted the competitiveness of the Premier League this season, noting the unpredictable nature of results. Any team can win or lose against any opponent.""The standings are super compact.""Iraola emphasized the importance of maintaining competitiveness and letting the final table determine their position at the end of the season.""We are seeing, especially this season in the Premier League, that every team can win against anyone and can also lose (against anyone).""He believes it's premature to focus on anything beyond the upcoming matches against Crystal Palace and Fulham.""So we have to keep being competitive and let's see where the table puts us.

Djokovic needs one more Grand Slam trophy for an unprecedented 25th crown, surpassing Margaret Court's 24, and the legend from Serbia is optimistic about achieving it in 2025, beginning his quest with the Australian Open in January.He will begin the season with the Brisbane International starting this week, which will also feature world number one Aryna Sabalenka leading the women' field.This season marks a significant shift as it's the first time in 37-year-old Djokovic's career where none of his traditional 'Big Four' rivals will compete, following the departures of Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray this year. Roger Federer announced his retirement in 2022.Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner decided to skip preparatory tournaments before the year's first major championship, the Australian Open, which starts on January 12.Based on the standards Djokovic sets, 2024 proved difficult, with no Grand Slam victories and only securing the Olympic gold in Paris, before concluding his season in October.The Brisbane tournament features strong competitors including an in-form Grigor Dimitrov, Holger Rune and Frances Tiafoe. Australian Nick Kyrgios joins the lineup after a lengthy absence, having played just one ATP Tour singles match in two years due to injuries.Djokovic will also be seen in men's doubles, partnering Kyrgios.On the women's side of the competition, there are American stars Jessica Pegula and Emma Navarro, ranked seventh and eighth respectively. The field also features former world number two Ons Jabeur and the experienced Victoria Azarenka.World No. 1 Sabalenka, who defeated China's rising star Zheng Qinwen in this year's Melbourne final, experienced an outstanding 2024, culminating in her recognition as WTA Player of the Year this month.The accomplished tennis player, aged 26, demonstrated remarkable success by reaching seven finals and securing four championships, including a successful defence of her Australian Open title, clinching her maiden US Open victory, and winning WTA 1000 tournaments in Cincinnati and Wuhan.She managed to regain the top world ranking from Swiatek, the five-time Grand Slam winner, whose standing faced scrutiny in November when reports emerged about her positive test for prohibited cardiac medication in August.The International Tennis Integrity Agency determined that the breach was unintentional, resulting in a minimal one-month penalty for the Polish athlete.The situation mirrors that of Australian Open champion Sinner, who awaits the World Anti-Doping Agency's verdict regarding his earlier clearance after two positive tests for clostebol traces in March.","Novak Djokovic needs one more Grand Slam trophy for an unprecedented 25th crown, surpassing Margaret Court's 24.

Excerpts:

Why did you and Ebden decide not to pursue the partnership in 2025?

What was your thinking behind partnering Nicolás Barrientos?

You partnered Sriram Balaji for the Olympics, was he an option?

You’ve announced you’re playing with Barrientos for just two tournaments, Adelaide and then the Australian Open…

Is 2025 your farewell season?

What did your success in that 12-month stretch from mid-2023 to the summer of 2024 tell you about yourself?

How does the future of Indian tennis look at this stage?

IN NUMBERS

At the start of the year Rohan Bopanna gave himself the best pre-44th birthday gift when he claimed the World No.1 ranking and clinched his first men’s doubles Grand Slam title in a spectacular 2024 Australian Open fortnight, where he became the poster boy for longevity.The Indian rode that wave with Matthew Ebden into the summer after which their season lost some shine, bringing to an end a strong partnership. Bopanna, ranked 15, starts the 2025 season down under in starkly different circumstances – pairing with the 37-year-old Colombian Nicolás Barrientos – but is no less determined to keep going.To me and my coach Scott (Davidoff) it came as a surprise, I don't think either of us expected it. I mean he had some reasons, he wanted to change.Initially, during the US Open, he said he was going to play with Austin Krajicek, but I think that fell apart and then he came back saying he wants to play with me. Then during the Paris Masters the Belgians — Joran Vliegen and Sanders Gille — split, when he decided he wanted to play with Vliegen. I don't know what the real reason behind that was.He was the one available, Ebden said he wanted to play with Joran Vliegen literally five days before Turin (in November). It was so late in the season, everybody already had a partner. One of the reasons to pair with Barrientos (ranked 49) was because there's a good chance for us to be seeded, especially because we’re going into a Grand Slam.It was going to be a random pairing anyway no matter who I played with, so I thought I might as well play with somebody who I can be seeded with at least. Especially since I'm defending the title. Also, he’s very strong off the baseline, he's very quick and makes a lot of balls and that game style could work for me. I've played against him but not really hung out with him so much. Even when I played with Ebden it was similar right.He was also set with another partner, same with Yuki Bhambri.One of the reasons we said only two tournaments is because it depends where we both are ranked after the Australian Open. If I don’t defend points, my ranking drops, so then no way Barrientos and me are getting into Masters or 500 Series draws. I haven't fixed with anybody else after (Australia) because it all depends on where I am ranked and where Barrientos is ranked.Everybody has been asking me the same thing for the last two years. It is tough (to think about retirement) when for the last two years, I've qualified for the season-ending championships. When you're making the ATP Finals it means you have had a good enough season so there is no reason really to stop.As long as I'm feeling fit and physically ready to play the Masters and the Grand Slams, it (retiring) is not even a consideration.The biggest thing was how well I was feeling physically and that translated into how well I ended up playing. As a team Ebden and I were doing incredibly well, we complimented each other beautifully. What changed personally for me was that belief of being able to perform at a high level and not looking at it in terms of whether I was (doing it) at age 40, at the fag end of my career or not.First and foremost for the future of Indian tennis, we need the federation to be sorted out, all tournaments juniors or seniors are determined through a solid federation. We need to create a strong domestic circuit. More than everybody looking to play Futures, Challengers, yes we need that, but I think a strong domestic circuit (is what we need the most). Also, once a player crosses 18 they are kind of lost because there’s no platform for them to transition to the next level so players in that age-group are giving up the sport because it is too expensive to travel. In the domestic circuit, there is hardly any prize money so nobody really wants to travel. The domestic circuit needs to grow, something similar to golf maybe.Bopanna claimed the World No.1 ranking after winning his first major doubles title at the 2024 Australian Open becoming the oldest first-time No. 1 at the age of 43.Bopanna and Ebden won the 2024 Miami Masters. At the age of 44, Bopanna overtook his own record to become the oldest ATP Masters 1000 finalist and champion.",Rohan Bopanna will play with Nicolás Barrientos for just two tournaments in 2025. The World No.15 is determined to keep going after winning the Australian Open. Bopana says the future of Indian tennis is in the juniors.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116646135,imgsize-115188,width-400,resizemode-4/116646135.jpg"

Rohit Sharma: 'Virat Kohli is a modern day great. He will figure it out'

While settled is not a space athletes would choose for themselves given that the race is all about moving forward, it’s equitable usage in the world of doubles and partnerships. Ask Yuki Bhambri .The 32-year-old, mid-career in the two-man team game, played alongside seven partners before settling with the 6-ft-8 Albano Olivetti with whom he contested 16 tournaments in 2024, making four finals and winning two titles, and finishing the year with a top-50 ranking for the first time in his career.“Four finals is good effort,” Bhambri said. “I don't think this was a fantastic season, but from where I was in January to where it ended, it’s good. It's nice to start a season with an existing partnership, that gives us a little bit of an edge.”Bhambri and Olivetti have Brisbane and Adelaide in their plans before the Australian Open in January.The Indo-French combine did well in the ATP 250s but are yet to break through in the higher category events.“We're still finding our feet in bigger events, in some matches we had chances, but some others we were just blown away,” Bhambri said. “This season was more of a learning experience we can do better in the next season thanks to all that we have learnt.”Bhambri, who finished the season with an individual doubles ranking of No. 48, did something he hasn’t done in the last five years, even when his body was broken and his spirits were low. In November he lined up a group of friends for an end-of-season holiday to Norway, ticking off the Northern Lights, which has long been on his bucket list.“We were there for a week, three cities -- Trondheim, Lofoten and Oslo. It was a nice break, a lot of snow, wind and layering (clothing),” Bhambri said, adding, “This was a mixed group, six of us. The good thing that came out of being injured (end of 2018 to early 2022) is that I got to spend a lot of time at home, I became social. I had the opportunity to meet some cool people outside of tennis.”“This holiday happened at a good time, I had a good season, that’s reason to celebrate. Some of the others in the group were also celebrating anniversaries and milestone birthdays so it was just nice,” Bhambri said.The 32-year-old, who was ranked No.1 in the juniors, winning boys singles title in the 2009 Australian Open, said his biggest takeaway from the season was patience.“I remember in January and February, I was really rattled. I was hoping to kick on to the next level… and not having those wins initially was tough,” he said. “Doubles is very fast-paced and unpredictable. You could be going home happy or sad depending on one point literally. I hadn't really experienced that roller-coaster of emotions before.”“I continued to do the work and play the matches with a positive frame of mind, but I do remember going into some events earlier on where you sort of doubted yourself a little bit. I wondered if I belonged in this level or not,” he said.Bhambri shifted to doubles after sitting out three seasons, save for a couple of tournaments, struggling with tendonitis on his right knee.“In singles you can see who the better player is at times,” he said. “In doubles you could bring all the right things to the court and still end up on the losing side.”Bhambri, who climbed to a career best No. 83 in singles in April 2018, learned the importance of being ‘level-headed’ while navigating the storm of competition. It doesn’t always add up in match play, but it is important to persevere.","Yuki Bhambri and Albano Olivetti have settled into doubles partnership.

Rohit Sharma: 'Virat Kohli is a modern day great. He will figure it out'

There’s a quasi-Indian story brewing in world tennis that has set tongues wagging. A Guntur-chili eating, Tollywood-watching teenager is burning the rectangle. Only the icon against his name is the United States flag, the country he was born and raised in.Nishesh Basavareddy , born in Newport Beach, California and grew up in Carmel, Indiana, started the 2024 season ranked No. 457; he’s at a career-high No. 138 in the ATP ranking presently.The 19-year-old enjoyed a rousing run on the Challenger Tour where he made six finals, winning two titles, including one in his last outing in Mexico. The American’s show, racking up a 41-13 record, not only earned him a place in the ATP Next Gen Finals in Jeddah, starting December 18, but also saw him clinch the USTA Australian Open wildcard that secured his spot in the Melbourne Park main draw.Basavareddy studied Data Science at Stanford University for two years before announcing in early December that he was turning professional.The American teenager, bespectacled, with a studious appearance, explained the Collegiate route was what the doctor ordered for him.“I was 17 when I graduated,” he said. “I had a lot of areas where I needed to mature, it was not just physically, as a person also. I had a lot of injuries when I was a junior so I thought it would be good to get a couple more years of matches in college while also having time to develop physically and tennis wise. Turning pro straight away after high school was never really an option for me.”Basavareddy is mentored by two-time Olympic silver medallist and multiple-time major winner Rajeev Ram , who also resides in Carmel, Indiana.“When I moved to Indiana, I started working with the same coach that he (Ram) used to work with and still does,” he said. “We started meeting when he was home from the Tour. Then, when I started to play professional tennis, he gave me advice about what to expect on the Tour and what to expect in this transition.”The teenager’s father Murali Reddy works in the Tech industry while his older brother Nishanth majored in Information Systems, both played tennis, his father more recreationally, while their mother Sai Prasanna is a homemaker. Basavareddy , who visited India often in his childhood, has family in Hyderabad and Nellore.The cuisine of choice for the family is Indian. Basavareddy says he’s not fluent in Telugu but doesn’t need subtitles when he’s watching Tollywood flicks.Basavareddy, twinkled-toed and thinking cap in place, picks his tennis IQ and return game as his biggest strengths.“I watched so much tennis when I was younger, I used to always have Tennis Channel running, trying to learn from whatever commentators were saying about the pros.

'Super afraid': Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek doping issues heighten tension among players,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jannik-sinner-and-iga-swiatek-doping-issues-heighten-tension-among-players/articleshow/116601911.cms,"Jannik Sinner (AFP Photo)

Professional tennis players are increasingly worried about unintentional doping violations due to contamination, especially after recent high-profile cases involving Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek . Both players faced doping charges but were eventually cleared. These incidents highlight the challenges athletes face regarding supplement contamination and the complexities of the anti-doping system.Sinner and Swiatek, who both reached the top ranking in professional tennis, incurred substantial expenses to demonstrate the unintentional nature of the banned substances found in their systems. This financial burden raises concerns for players with fewer resources.“A lot of the players I know are quite apprehensive,” former U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu said.Raducanu expressed her concerns about the risk of contamination in supplements and the financial burden of batch testing. Many players are cautious about the supplements they take due to the risk of contamination.“Everything we take, we're aware of the situation and how easily things can be contaminated. There are certain supplements that I may want to take, but I can't take them because they're sold over the counter and not batch tested.”The cost of batch testing, exceeding $1,000, creates a financial barrier for many athletes.Russian tennis player Andrey Rublev , a former world number five, shared similar anxieties about consuming anything he's not entirely certain about. He admitted to being 'super afraid.'Andrea Petroczi, a researcher on anti-doping at Kingston University in London, confirmed the growing apprehension among elite athletes worldwide regarding unintentional doping violations due to contamination. Her research reveals increasing concerns among athletes about the potential consequences of such violations.“(They) expressed fear and anxiety about unintentionally violating anti-doping rules that could have grave consequences on their reputation, careers and livelihoods,” Petroczi explained.Athletes are adopting various precautionary measures to minimize the risk of contamination. These measures include thoroughly checking medications, avoiding unnecessary treatments, and opting for third-party tested supplements.Athletes also meticulously record batch numbers of supplements and medicines. Some even go to the extent of maintaining detailed logs and avoiding specific foods in certain countries. However, they recognize that even these precautions cannot entirely eliminate the risk.“Importantly, it's also crucial to acknowledge that the resources and strategies required for this level of vigilance aren't universally accessible,” Petroczi emphasized.The accessibility of resources and strategies for such vigilance varies across different regions. This disparity in access creates additional challenges for athletes in certain areas.“There is a clear 'Global North'/'Global South' divide, with disparities in education, resources and support systems, leaving many athletes more vulnerable.”Jannik Sinner's case involved trace amounts of clostebol, an anabolic androgenic steroid. He successfully demonstrated to doping authorities that the substance entered his system through massages administered by his physiotherapist.Despite being cleared, Sinner faces a potential ban of up to two years due to an appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency. The ongoing appeal creates uncertainty regarding Sinner's future participation in professional tennis.Iga Swiatek, who tested positive for trimetazidine, a hormone and metabolic modulator, served a one-month ban. She attributed the positive test to contamination of her sleep medication.Swiatek revealed the significant financial costs she incurred in defending her case, including legal fees and expert opinions. She spent $70,000 on a lawyer and over $15,000 on expert opinions.“Importantly, it's also crucial to acknowledge that the resources and strategies required for this level of vigilance aren't universally accessible,” Petroczi emphasized.The handling of Sinner and Swiatek's cases contrasts with the experiences of other players, such as Simona Halep and Tara Moore , who have criticized the anti-doping system for lengthy delays in their cases. The contrasting experiences highlight inconsistencies in the handling of doping cases.The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) assumed responsibility for tennis's anti-doping program in 2022. The ITIA was formed by the seven governing bodies of tennis after a comprehensive review of the previous system, which was overseen by the International Tennis Federation.Sinner and Swiatek's cases are the most high-profile investigations undertaken by the ITIA since it took over. Both players held the world number one ranking when they failed their tests, further highlighting the significance of these cases.The ITIA asserts that all doping cases are handled impartially, based on evidence and facts, irrespective of a player's ranking, name, or nationality. However, concerns about potential discrepancies in the system persist.Petroczi highlighted the impact of limited access to legal representation and advanced analytical testing on an athlete's ability to effectively contest a doping case . These limitations create further disparities within the system.Being unable to access legal representation and advanced analytical testing would impact an athlete's ability to fight a doping case, Petroczi added, and sports federations and anti-doping organisations had to address this disparity in resources.Addressing the disparity in resources available to athletes requires collective efforts from sports federations and anti-doping organizations. These efforts should focus on ensuring equitable access to expert support and transparency in processes.“Efforts could include providing equitable access to expert support, ensuring transparency in processes, and exploring ways to mitigate the impact of resource gaps,” Petroczi suggested.Unlike athletes in many other sports, tennis players are essentially self-employed. Therefore, any time away from the game due to a doping ban or related legal battles directly impacts their income.Andrey Rublev advocated for quicker rulings in cases of accidental contamination and a degree of flexibility in the anti-doping rules. He believes the current system is overly strict and creates undue fear among players.“Of course, you want to have a clean sport,” Rublev stated.He emphasized the importance of maintaining a clean sport while also expressing concerns about the strictness of the current rules. He believes the system needs to be more flexible to avoid penalizing players for unintentional violations.“But you also want (it to be) not so strict because then you make all the tennis players so afraid that even those situations (that are not you fault) cost you a year.”The current system can lead to significant penalties, including lengthy bans, even in cases of accidental contamination. This creates a climate of fear among players.“It shouldn't be like that.”",Professional tennis players are increasingly worried about unintentional doping violations due to contamination.

CHENNAI: Touted as one of the brightest young players from India, 15-year-old Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi has been called up to train at the prestigious Rafa Nadal Academy in Spain. Several top players have successfully graduated from the academy and made a mark in the sport.The Tamil Nadu teenager, who has signed a one-year contract, will begin her stint formally in January. Looking for training opportunities in Europe, Maaya chose the Rafa Nadal Academy.“We wanted her to train in Europe as it is one of the best places. The offer came directly from the Rafa Nadal Academy. They conducted a screening process for about a week or 10 days. After the screening, they offered her a contract for one year,” Manoj, Maaya’s personal coach and mentor for the past five years, told TOI on Friday.“Maaya has been assigned a dedicated coach. She will also have a coach who could travel with her for tournaments. Maaya had visited a couple of other academies and in the end, we (her coach and family) decided to take up the offer from Nadal’s academy,” Manoj added.The past few months have been pretty good for Maaya as she has defeated several top junior players in the ITF circuit . She went on to reach the final of the National Championships after getting through the qualifying stage. The stint at the academy could prove to be a game-changer and will be worth its weight in gold.“The next couple of years are very crucial for her. She needs to climb the ladder pretty quickly. I think that the focus should be more on doing well at the senior level. She needs to start doing reasonably well in the women’s circuit in another year or year-and-a-half. She has the potential to do well. On the women’s side, I think that she is the next bet forIndian tennis ,” said Manoj about Maaya, India No. 2 among juniors.While Maaya will be training in Spain, Manoj will continue to mentor her from India. “If she travels to or within Asia, maybe I could probably travel with her if that is a requirement,” Manoj said.Up next for the youngster is three ITF tournaments in India from December to January. “Maaya has opted not to play the junior Australian Open (if she gets into the qualifying draw). She has to get her visa to be in Spain for a year, so that will take a little bit of time.”","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi has been called up to train at the prestigious Rafa Nadal Academy in Spain.

Head coach feels lucrative prize money & better scheduling could draw top stars

BENGALURU: Over the past five years, the number of Indian star shuttlers featuring in the individual events at the Senior national badminton championship has dwindled sharply. The ongoing competition at the Karnataka Badminton Association (KBA) here is no different. Of the six Indian men ranked inside the top 50 in the BWF rankings, only Satish Kumar Karunakaran, ranked 45, is competing, while Anupama Upadhyaya (ranked 46) and Aakarshi Kashyap (47) are the top-ranked women players in fray.As a result, Badminton Association of India (BAI) secretary general Sanjay Mishra recently said the federation in future could make the premier domestic event mandatory.India head coach Pullela Gopichand remarked, ""It’s always a challenge when you want (top) athletes to play two circuits, international and national, or national and state. Ideally, there should be only one calendar,"" he said here Sunday.""…the importance of the national championship has gone down. How do we revive it?"" he questioned.Scheduling is one of the key reasons for top players not featuring in the nationals. With the competition played at the year’s end, it is internationally offseason and an ideal resting period for the players. It is also the phase during which many of them begin preparations for the next season, which starts in early January.With star players focusing on major international events, which offer bigger prize money and ranking points, how can a player be convinced to play in the nationals?""You must give them benefits. Making it mandatory is one way, but they could just come, walk the first day, lose a match and walk off. That’s not the purpose. So, you want them to come here prepared and perform. So, either the prize money needs to be at a point where it is motivating or certain things such as an honour or a facility should be there,"" said Gopi.He also suggested the duration of the competition be reduced to three days.","Head coach feels lucrative prize money & better scheduling could draw top stars.

P.V. Sindhu, a two-time Olympic medalist, confirmed her plans to continue playing badminton for the next few years, with the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics in mind. Her recent victory at the Syed Modi International badminton tournament ended a title drought and brought her relief.Sindhu hopes this win marks a new phase of success in her career. The 29-year-old former world champion acknowledges that staying injury-free is crucial as she moves forward.“This (win) will definitely give me a lot of confidence. Being 29 is an advantage in many ways because I have a lot of experience. Being smart and experienced is key, and I'm definitely going to play for the next couple of years.”Sindhu recognizes the benefits of experience at her age. She emphasizes the importance of strategic play and plans to continue competing. Her primary focus remains on injury prevention.“My main goal is to stay injury-free, which is very, very important. Los Angeles (Olympics) is still too far away. I will definitely play, but the main thing is staying injury-free and enjoying the sport. If I stay fit, then why not?”While the Los Angeles Olympics are a long-term goal, Sindhu intends to participate if she remains fit. She defeated China's Wu Luo Yu in the Syed Modi International final, securing her third title in this tournament. Her previous wins were in 2017 and 2022.“I'm very happy that I'm finishing off with a win. Now it's time to just go back, relax, and start again from January. I hope this is a comeback, and I'm looking forward to many more victories.”Sindhu expresses her happiness at ending the year with a victory. She plans to rest and prepare for upcoming tournaments in Malaysia, India, Indonesia, and Thailand.“I'll be playing the upcoming tournaments in Malaysia, India, Indonesia, and Thailand. Obviously, we'll have to pick and choose tournaments because I'll have to be smart enough to decide what to play and what not. I need to be much smarter in terms of that.”Sindhu will carefully select tournaments to manage her schedule and fitness. Her previous title was at the Singapore Open in July 2022. She was also a finalist at the Malaysia Masters Super 500 earlier this year. However, she experienced a pre-quarterfinal exit at the Paris Olympics.“Sometimes I was really close yet so far away. I had good matches in the past, but they didn't turn into wins. I came back, fought harder, and it was important for me to get this win. Yes, I am relieved. I mean, it's the end of the year, and finishing off with a win makes me really grateful.”Sindhu reflects on past near misses and expresses gratitude for her recent win. Lakshya Sen , the 2021 World Championships bronze medalist, won the men's singles final against Singapore's Jia Heng Jason Teh.“I am really happy with the way I had prepared and how I played the match. I hope to do well in the tournaments next year. I have some time now till the new season, which will allow me to train and focus on the upcoming events.”Sen expresses satisfaction with his preparation and performance. He looks forward to the next season and plans to utilize the time for training. The Indian women's doubles pair of Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand won their first Super 300 title. They defeated China's Bao Li Jing and Li Qian.“We really wanted to win, we were aggressive and kept moving well. There was a strategy, and we implemented it well today. We plan to go with the flow and see what the future holds. We don't want to make too many plans.”Gayatri and Treesa highlight their aggressive strategy and successful implementation. They prefer to remain adaptable for future tournaments. This victory boosts their confidence ahead of the BWF World Tour Finals in China, where they are the sole Indian representatives.“This is our first gold, and it's a great boost for both of us. It has given us a lot of confidence, and we are looking forward to the World Tour Finals now.”The pair view their win as a significant confidence booster for the upcoming World Tour Finals. They are the first Indian women's doubles team to win the Syed Modi International title. They were runners-up in 2022.“The first game was close, but we listened to our coaches, corrected ourselves, and executed the plans. At this level, there is always pressure, and we managed it well.”Treesa and Gayatri credit their coaches for helping them adjust their strategy during the match. They acknowledge the pressure at this level of competition and their ability to handle it effectively.","P.V. Sindhu confirmed her plans to continue playing badminton for the next few years.

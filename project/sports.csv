Shubman Gill and Mohammed Siraj press conference: India stars answer all questions

Poll Do you think Shubman Gill has the potential to be one of India's greatest batsmen? Yes, absolutely! Maybe, he needs more experience. No, he won't reach that level.

Thoda sa off-stump ke bahar hai toh cut maare. Thoda sa short de do toh pull maare. Dusra net band ho gaya, inka hi net chal raha and sab dekh rahe hai ki ye kya hai.

Isko abhi khila do

Former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar revealed an interesting story about Shubman Gill 's first net session, which left Virat Kohli MS Dhoni , and head coach Ravi Shastri stunned.Gill made his India debut in the one-day international in Hamilton, New Zealand.Back then, India skipper Virat Kohli had said that watching the young Shubman Gill bat at the nets made him realize he was not even 10 per cent as talented when he was 19.""I saw him bat in the nets and I was like wow, I was not even ten per cent of that when I was 19,"" Kohli had said.Bangar, who was the batting coach back then, echoed Kohli's sentiments.""It was his first session and he walked out to bat in the nets. Ravi Shastri was the head coach, the captain was Virat Kohli, and MS Dhoni was still in the team. We were preparing for the 2019 ODI World Cup,"" Bangar said on Doordarshan Sports.""The side-arm throwers and I started to bowl at Shubman. When we pitched it up, he would play the drive.(If the ball was a little outside off-stump, he cut it. If it was slightly short, he pulled it.The other nets stopped; only his net was going on, and everyone was watching in amazement — wondering what this was.)""Bangar also explained how hyped coach Shastri was, saying he wanted Gill straight into the playing XI.""Coach Ravi Shastri was so impressed that he wanted to put him in the playing XI. ‘’ (Play him now).""He left that kind of imprint in his first net session itself, and we realized then that this boy was special,"" he added.","Former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar revealed an interesting story about Shubman Gill's first net session.

President Donald Trump will attend the US Open men's final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner on Sunday, watching from Rolex's suite in Arthur Ashe Stadium, according to a report from Associated Press. This information was shared by an anonymous source familiar with the arrangements.The website Bounces was the first to report about the Rolex suite invitation. Presidential attendance at the US Open is uncommon, with Bill Clinton being the last sitting president to attend in 2000.This marks Trump's first appearance at the New York Grand Slam tournament since 2015, before his presidential campaign. He will be attending as a guest of the Swiss watchmaker.The timing of Trump's acceptance of Rolex's suite invitation is significant, following his administration's recent implementation of a 39% tariff on Swiss products. This tariff is substantially higher than those imposed on exports from the European Union and Britain to the United States.The championship match between top-ranked Jannik Sinner and second-ranked Carlos Alcaraz adds to Trump's recent appearances at major sporting events.He has attended the Super Bowl, Daytona 500, UFC fights, NCAA wrestling championships, and the FIFA Club World Cup final.""Our policy is to regularly ask our broadcasters to refrain from showcasing off-court disruptions,"" said the US Tennis Association, which is why ABC's broadcast of Sunday's match may not show any potential protests that occur during the event. Trump was a regular attendee at the US Open before his political career, when he resided in New York.Currently, Trump primarily splits his time between his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, and Washington. The Trump Organisation previously had its own suite at Arthur Ashe Stadium, next to the broadcasting booth, but discontinued its use in 2017.Former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama were present at the tournament's opening night in 2023.","President Donald Trump will attend the US Open men's final on Sunday.

India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking points

Poll Do you agree with Yuvraj Singh that playing golf can help cricketers improve their game? Yes, absolutely! No, not really.

Ahead of the 2025 Asia Cup, the former India all-rounder has requested Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma not to repeat the mistake he made during his playing years and to play golf, as it will help them score more runs.""I have told them to play golf and I encourage them to play. It's very hard to find time, but I think the IPL is a good time for them to actually find time and hit some balls,"" Yuvraj said at an event.""It's up to them. Now they are superstars of the game and they have to decide what's going to help them be better. If golf can be something, then they have to decide that. But I encourage all athletes to play golf. I think it's a great way to unwind and it's great for the mind.""When asked whether playing golf would help them, Yuvraj said: ""I feel that any sport that helps you relax is going to be less taxing on the body and more fruitful for the mind. If you see the culture of golf in Australia, South Africa, England—majority of the best cricketers have played golf from a very young age.""You see a lot of these guys actually play a lot of golf and do less cricket practice during tours. You can't change something in a game in three days.But how can you recover and be mentally fresh for a game? So I just feel it's not just cricket. For any sportsperson in the world, they should play golf because eventually it will bring out the best in them in their sport.""Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma are set to open for India in the upcoming Asia Cup, starting next week.Yuvraj said if he had played golf during his playing years, he would have scored 3,000 more international runs.""I would have scored 3,000 more runs,"" said Yuvraj.""I tell all the young cricketers to try and play golf, hit the ball, see how you feel. Because sometimes too much practice is also not good for you. Sometimes when you're not scoring runs, you want to practice more, and with golf as well, you want to hit more balls. But sometimes it's good to relax,"" he said.","Yuvraj Singh says he would have scored 3,000 more international runs if he had played golf during his playing years.

Poll How do you feel about the Pandya brothers' support for their childhood coach? Inspiring Generous Unexpected Overrated

The Pandya brothers, Hardik and Krunal, are known to be fierce competitors on the field, unwilling to budge an inch. No equation seems out of reach, considering their warrior-like hunger and desire to dominate the opposition. However, there is a softer side to their personality off the field. Despite witnessing the heights of success, the Pandya brothers continue to value and support their childhood coach Jitendra Singh , just like a member of their immediate family, providing ""financial assistance of nearly Rs 70-80 lakhs"".""Hardik and Krunal ensured that my first sister's wedding took place smoothly in 2018, stepping up with monetary assistance. Not only this, they also transferred Rs 20 lakhs for purchasing a car, along with other gifts, during my second sister's marriage in February 2024. Hardik said, 'Your sister is my sister. Just let me know whenever the wedding gets fixed'. After being informed about the date, he simply responded, 'Don't worry. Just ensure that all things go well', taking care of all the requirements,"" said Jitendra in an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com.Hardik began his IPL career with the Mumbai Indians (MI) in IPL 2015, which emerged as a major source of happiness for the Pandya family as well as their coach. However, Jitendra suffered an unexpected blow during Hardik's absence after his mother fell seriously unwell all of a sudden.""I didn't mention the issue to Hardik to avoid any distractions. However, he figured out that there was something amiss after returning to Baroda and questioned me. I eventually opened up. After hearing about my mother's ill health, Hardik simply said, 'Please take all my money and make sure she recovers'. This was the first instance of their generosity and showcases our relationship,"" said Jitendra.""Hardik further gifted me a car which cost Rs 5-6 lakhs after returning from India's 2015-16 tour of Australia, which marked his first appearance with the national team, despite not being financially strong. I was caught by surprise and wasn't agreeable initially. Even Krunal attempted to convince me. However, I eventually relented after Hardik said, 'We are giving you a car for your safety. You shouldn't suffer an accident while driving a bike'. That was his way of acknowledging a coach who'd always been there when needed,"" added Jitendra.The relationship shared by the Pandya brothers with their childhood coach is further evident from a message shared by Hardik on Facebook in 2017, on the occasion of Teacher's Day.""On this day, I would like to say thank you to many teachers in my life, but the one who deserves the most is this guy, Jitu Singh sir. The guy who stood there with me in all ups and downs and always made sure I kept going! Thank you coach, we love you. I got your back always,"" he said.While the phrase 'I got your back' is thrown around lightly nowadays, the Pandya brothers have ensured that they live up to the significance involved. ""Hardik and Krunal helped me financially after MI won the IPL in 2017 and 2019. Krunal also transferred Rs 18 lakhs to purchase a car after RCB won IPL 2025. The overall financial assistance received from the Pandya brothers has been nearly Rs 70-80 lakhs. Their gestures definitely mean a lot considering I hail from a lower middle-class familial background,"" said Jitendra.""The Pandya brothers bore every expense on my behalf when they got married, personally ensuring my utmost comfort in every aspect. They ensure I have access to the best resources without a single penny being spent from my pocket. Hardik gifted me Nike merchandise worth Rs 2 lakhs back in 2016. All my clothing has been gifted by Hardik and Krunal, which I wouldn't have been able to afford otherwise. It is certainly a blessing and a matter of great fortune for any coach to have students like them,"" he added.","The Pandya brothers, Hardik and Krunal, are known to be fierce competitors on the field, unwilling to budge an inch.

Poll Should Rishabh Pant be considered as the best wicketkeeper-batter of India in Test cricket? Yes, definitely Maybe No

Former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar has praised Rishabh Pant for his fearless approach and natural talent behind the stumps. Bangar recalled how former fast bowler Ashish Nehra had predicted Pant’s rapid rise as a special player early in his career.Pant, often described as an entertainer in red-ball cricket, impressed everyone with his aggressive strokeplay during the inaugural Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy. In just four matches and seven innings, the 27-year-old amassed 479 runs at an average of 68.42, including two centuries and three fifties.Speaking to Doordarshan Sports, Bangar highlighted Pant’s aggressive mindset even in practice. He said, ""I had heard from Ashish Nehra that Rishabh is a very good player who is going to progress very quickly. He is a naturally gifted batter, but he is also very fearless. I saw the first signs of his fearlessness in the nets itself.He used to tell the bowlers to bowl quickly and attack his body. Very few people have had this mindset. He had just begun playing the IPL back then, so Nehra's assessment was correct. After a long time, we have found a wicketkeeper who can bat in the top five.""Pant faced a scare in the series finale at The Oval when he was struck on the foot by a yorker from England pacer Chris Woakes . The impact forced him to retire hurt on 37 off 54 balls, and he was unable to walk off the field without a golf buggy.Defying the injury, Pant returned to the crease with a broken foot. The crowd erupted in applause as he continued to bat, adding crucial runs to India’s total. He raised his bat to acknowledge a well-earned fifty and with his signature flamboyance, helped India reach 358.Pant’s courage and skill have cemented him as one of India’s rare wicketkeeper-batters capable of dominating in the top order.",Former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar has praised Rishabh Pant for his fearless approach and natural talent behind the stumps.

Who did what in India’s first Asia Cup 2025 practice – Sky, Hardik, Bumrah & Gill

Poll Will aggressive batting be the key to India's success in the Asia Cup? Yes, absolutely! No, we need a balanced approach.

NEW DELHI: Defending champions India intensified their Asia Cup 2025 preparations with another full-fledged practice session at the ICC Academy in Dubai on Saturday. While bowlers kept the intensity high, the major talking point of Day 2 was the way India's top-order batters focused heavily on big-hitting, particularly aerial shots, in the nets.India open their campaign against hosts UAE on September 10 before taking on arch-rivals Pakistan on September 14 and Oman on September 19. With less than a week to go, the practice sessions have been geared toward match readiness, with a clear emphasis on aggressive batting.According to updates shared by journalist Vimal Kumar on his YouTube channel, all the top-order names – Shubman Gill Abhishek Sharma , Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav and Rinku Singh – padded up and spent significant time in the nets. Each of them tested their range-hitting, sending balls consistently over the ropes. Gill, known for his classical stroke play, too worked extensively on his aerial game, while Suryakumar and Shivam Dube added their natural flair.The standout, however, was young opener Abhishek Sharma, who cleared the boundary with remarkable ease and consistency, making a strong case for himself as Gill's opening partner. The left-hander's effortless six-hitting was noted as the highlight of the session.Rinku Singh, after his batting stint, also underwent a separate fielding drill under coach T Dilip.Jasprit Bumrah bowled long spells, particularly to Gill, while Arshdeep Singh tested batters with short-pitched deliveries. Hardik Pandya contributed in both departments – bowling early on before switching to batting. Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakaravarthy kept the batters honest with extended spells of spin, with Kuldeep even beating Tilak Varma on occasion.Sanju Samson, who skipped batting in the early stage of nets and instead spent a prolonged knocking session with batting coach Sitanshu Kotak, later joined the batting session and was seen clearing the boundary with ease. With Gill, Samson, and Abhishek all in contention, it will be interesting to see who emerges as India’s designated openers.Discussions between head coach Gautam Gambhir, captain Suryakumar Yadav, and vice-captain Gill were also observed, hinting at tactical fine-tuning.India are the designated hosts of the Asia Cup, being played across venues in the UAE. With their batters showing attacking intent in practice, fans can expect an aggressive approach when the Men in Blue begin their title defense.","Defending champions India intensified their Asia Cup 2025 preparations with another full-fledged practice session at the ICC Academy in Dubai on Saturday.

India’s squad for Asia Cup:

Former Indian opener Virender Sehwag has opened up about the intense emotions he felt whenever India lost to Pakistan. With the highly anticipated Asia Cup clash between the arch-rivals scheduled for September 14, Sehwag recalled how such defeats often made him lose his focus and temper.Sehwag, who played 42 matches against Pakistan and averaged 50.65, admits that while he has celebrated 17 wins, he has been on the losing side 21 times. The frequent setbacks against Pakistan, he says, sometimes disrupted his concentration on the field.""Whenever you lose against Pakistan. So I would lose my concentration. I would lose my temperament and everything,"" Sehwag said.One of his most memorable performances came during India’s 2008 tour of Pakistan. Facing a steep target of 300 in Karachi, Sehwag produced a masterful innings of 119 from just 95 balls. He struck 12 boundaries and five sixes, helping India chase down the total with 47 balls to spare. Remarkably, he accomplished this while fasting, showing his sheer determination to succeed even under challenging conditions.“I was on a fast that day. On an empty stomach. I had to score runs to satisfy that hunger,” Sehwag said while reflecting on the innings.Sehwag shared these insights in a video posted by Sony Sports Network on X. You can watch the full video here.

Poll Do you believe Axar Patel is one of India's most underrated players? Yes, absolutely! No, he gets enough recognition.

Ahead of the Asia Cup 2025, veteran India batter Ajinkya Rahane highlighted all-rounder Axar Patel as one of the team’s most underrated players. The continental tournament gets underway on Tuesday, September 9, with Afghanistan facing Hong Kong. India, led by Suryakumar Yadav , will play their opening match against the hosts UAE in Dubai on September 10. Rahane shared his thoughts in a video on his YouTube channel, speaking about Axar’s growth over the past few years and stressing the all-rounder’s value for the team in the spin-friendly conditions expected in Dubai.“I feel he is a very much underrated player. He has improved as a player, as a cricketer, in the last two to three years. He has done really well. Whenever he has got an opportunity as a batter or a bowler, he has performed for the team. He can bowl with the new ball in the powerplay, he can bowl in the middle overs, and if needed, he can bowl in the death overs,” Rahane said.He added, “As a captain, when you have a player like Axar Patel in the team, you are always happy. Let’s not forget his fielding ability as well. With the Asia Cup in Dubai, the wickets are likely to favor spinners. Axar’s skill and experience will be very important for the team.”Rahane also backed all-rounder Hardik Pandya as a key player for India in the tournament.“Hardik’s role in this Asia Cup will be really important. As an all-rounder, he has done very well for the team in the past. Coming in at No. 5 or 6, he can create impact, play with a high strike rate, read the situation, and adjust his game accordingly. I am sure he can do it again,” Rahane said.He added, “What I would like to see from Hardik is him bowling his four overs. If he can bowl all four overs, it will give the team a very good balance.”With his insights shared on his YouTube channel, Rahane emphasised the importance of balance and experience in India’s squad as they head into the Asia Cup 2025.","Ajinkya Rahane believes all-rounder Axar Patel is one of India's most underrated players.

Poll Would you like to see more Indian players participating in overseas leagues? Yes No

Sourav Ganguly

Despite the backdrop of Dinesh Karthik playing in the SA20 last year and speculation of tens of Indians entering the SA20 Auction on September 9, no Indians will be up for grabs for the fourth season, and beyond, of South Africa's T20 league. SA20 League Commissioner Graeme Smith has called the situation 'fluid.'A total of 241 overseas players will be auctioned for 25 slots, while 308 South Africans will compete for 59 places in the SA20 Auction in Johannesburg.""Indian players are always a fluid situation depending on who's retiring and who's available. I think it was like 13 or 14 Indian players in the auction,"" the former South African captain told Indian media in a virtual interaction facilitated by SA20.Piyush Chawla, Siddharth Kaul, Ankit Rajpoot, Sarul Kanwar, Anureet Singh Kathuria, Ansari Marouf, Mahesh Ahir, Nikhil Jaga, Mohamed Faidh, KS Naveen, Imran Khan, Venkatesh Galipelly, and Atul Yadav had all registered for the SA20 Auction. But the 13 players have not made the shortlist from the initial 800-plus registrations.As per BCCI's rules, only retired Indian players - from internationals, domestic and IPL - are allowed to play in overseas leagues.Dinesh Karthik fit that bill and was picked up by the Paarl Royals, becoming the first Indian to feature in the SA20.Explaining the auction process, Smith said: ""What we do is we send the auction lists, which was over 800 names, to the franchises. They then send us their shortlist back and then we collate a shortened list that goes to the auction.""For us this year, it was a big stepping stone. It was also, you know, after three years of the tournament, we felt that it was time to kind of reset the regulations.""On the absence of Indians, Smith said: ""You don't see an abundance of them involved in T20 leagues around the world. It's not a new thing. One thing that we have seen from our stats is that we’ve built a really strong viewership in India.""Even if there might not be Indian flavour to the league on the pitch, there would be one on the sidelines with Sourav Ganguly being roped in as the head coach of the Pretoria Capitals.""For us, it's exciting to have a coach of Dada's quality. The quality of coaches across the board is exciting. It's an exposure to our players to great minds. Dada is going to come and do things in his own way. The Pretoria Capitals didn't have the best year last year.""I am sure he will be motivated at the auction to get a quality group of players to take forward into the season,' he added.South African cricket will hope Ganguly and the competitive league can further the skills of the youngsters especially with the T20 World Cup to follow and ODI World Cup on their (and Zimbabwe and Namibia's) shores in two year's time.""Look, I think our pitches didn't play as well as we would have liked last season,"" said Smith on a low-scoring season last time around. ""I think in the build up to the 2027 World Cup, there's a lot of infrastructure development underway in South Africa, improvement of stadiums. All our six stadiums where SA20 will be played will have new lights for season four, pitches are not going to be as overused.""And there's also a plan in terms of redevelopment of training facilities and pitches.""I think the thing about South Africa as well is that every region kind of plays a little bit differently. You've got the coastal regions where the pitches play a certain way. And then you've got the highveld at Wanderers Pretoria where the ball travels and pitches have a bit more pace and carry. So, there will be a natural variance in playing around South Africa.""But, you know, what we want is to develop a highly competitive league that the majority of our players hit that World Cup in February in form, being well-prepared, being well-exposed to competitive cricket, that the South African team can hopefully go and build a back-to-back trophy hunt in India,"" he concluded.","No Indians will be up for grabs for the fourth season, and beyond, of South Africa's T20 league.

Zimbabwe pulled off a memorable win in Harare, beating Sri Lanka by five wickets in the second T20I to level the series. The hosts bowled brilliantly to skittle Sri Lanka out for just 80, their second-lowest total in the format, before holding their nerve in the chase to seal only their second-ever T20I victory over the Lankans.It was a tough outing for Sri Lanka, who simply didn’t have enough runs on the board. Their 80 all out was also the lowest total recorded at Harare, beating Zimbabwe’s own 90/9 against Afghanistan back in 2022. For Sri Lanka, this became their second-lowest score in T20Is, only behind the 77 they made against South Africa in New York earlier this year. Dushmantha Chameera gave the visitors some hope with a fiery opening spell, taking three quick wickets, but Zimbabwe’s batters kept calm. Ryan Burl and Tashinga Musekiwa stitched together an important stand that guided the side home.Earlier, Bennett and Burl did well to steady the innings when the chase got tricky at 61 for 5, before Musekiwa finished the game with a couple of confident boundaries. Sikandar Raza , who was named Player of the Match, praised his team’s effort. “We kept saying we are close to playing good cricket, it is nice to be on the other side of the result. There is a sigh of relief for everybody,” he said after the win. Raza also credited his teammates for stepping up and expressed hope that Zimbabwe could now push for the series victory in the decider.","Zimbabwe beat Sri Lanka by five wickets in the second T20I in Harare.

South stay in the race

Brief scores:

The strength of the Central Zone team lay in flashes of individual batting brilliance on the penultimate day of their Duleep Trophy semifinal against West Zone here on Saturday.At the BCCI Centre of Excellence, most of the Central batters looked settled enough to go past the three-figure mark, yet none managed to cross it. Still, their collective effort was enough to put West on the back foot and secure the first-innings honours. Responding to West’s 438, Central reached 556/8 in 157 overs with a crucial 118-run lead.Shardul Thakur and his men will now need something extraordinary on a placid surface to halt Central’s march into the final.Resuming from their overnight score of 229/2, Shubham Sharma (96; 241b; 11x4) and captain Rajat Patidar (77; 84b; 14x4) got down to business quickly. Patidar, needing three runs to complete his half-century, brought it up by dispatching Thakur through covers for a boundary. His form continued as he struck four boundaries in a single Tanush Kotian over. Sharma, meanwhile, played the steady hand as the pair added 55 runs in the first 10 overs of the morning.But the 127-run partnership ended when Patidar lost his stumps attempting a sweep against Dharmendrasinh Jadeja (4/101). Central suffered another blow when Yash Rathod fell cheaply to Jadeja, with Ruturaj Gaikwad taking a sharp catch at first slip. Sharma, who had slowed after Patidar’s dismissal, was run out on 96 while attempting a quick single, undone by a direct hit from Kotian.The middle and lower order kept the momentum going. Upendra Yadav (87; 181b; 8x4, 2x6), Harsh Dubey (75; 93b; 13x4) and Deepak Chahar (33) frustrated West, whose bowlers toiled without much reward despite using eight different options. A brief rain interruption delayed play, but Central finished firmly in control.The other semifinal between South and North had plenty of drama on Day 3. Replying to South’s imposing first-innings total of 536, North stumbled early as Gurjapneet Singh (3/67) removed skipper Ankit Kumar and the in-form Yash Dhull within the first hour. Ayush Badoni (40) provided some stability before Shubham Khajuria (128 not out; 245b; 20x4, 1x6) and Nishant Sindhu (82; 148b; 9x4, 1x6) took charge. The pair put on a superb 171-run stand for the fourth wicket, dominating the South attack for much of the day.However, South clawed back late in the evening. Sindhu’s uppercut off Gurjapneet was caught in the deep by substitute Shaik Rasheed, and Kanhaiya Wadhawan was run out without scoring soon after. At stumps, North were 278/5 in 79 overs, still trailing by 258 runs, leaving the contest delicately poised heading into the final day.West Zone: 438 vs Central Zone (O/n: 229/2) 556/8 in 157 overs (Ayush Pandey 40, Danish Malewar 76, Shubham Sharma 96, Rajat Patidar 77, Upendra Yadav 87, Harsh Dubey 75, Saransh Jain 37*, Deepak Chahar 33; Dharmendrasinh Jadeja 4-101).South Zone: 536 vs North Zone 278/5 in 79 overs (Shubham Khajuria 128*, Ayush Badoni 40, Nishant Sindhu 82; Gurjapneet Singh 3-67).","Central Zone reach 556/8 in 157 overs, a 118-run lead over West Zone.

Poll Who do you think should open alongside Abhishek Sharma for India in the Asia Cup 2025? Shubman Gill Sanju Samson

Former Indian cricketer Madan Lal shared his thoughts on India’s opening pair for the upcoming Asia Cup 2025, set to take place from September 9 to 28 in Dubai. The Men in Blue have three potential candidates to open the innings: vice-captain Shubman Gill , wicketkeeper Sanju Samson , and left-hand batter Abhishek Sharma The inclusion of Gill in the squad has sparked questions about who will open alongside Abhishek Sharma. Samson is also part of the squad, and it is likely that he will bat in the middle order while Gill and Abhishek take charge at the top.Speaking to ANI, Madan Lal expressed confidence in the combination. He said, ""Abhishek Sharma is known for his explosive hitting, while Shubman Gill can anchor the innings and accelerate when needed. Opening is very important in T20Is. In the first six overs, the openers set the tone for the game. After that, you have to ensure steady scoring until the middle overs, and in the last three to four overs, big hitters like Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel can finish the innings strongly.""The Asia Cup will be played in Dubai, where hot weather conditions are expected. This can play into the hands of spinners. India boast a strong spinning department with Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, and Axar Patel in the main squad, and Washington Sundar in the reserves.Madan Lal highlighted the importance of spinners in these conditions. He said, ""It's very hot here. The spinner's role will always be crucial.The key is to get an early breakthrough, and then the spinners can take over. We have the best spinners in the world. If we get a breakthrough in the beginning, the spinners can be very lethal and do a wonderful job. Spinners will play a big role. Afghanistan has four spinners and Pakistan has three. Most countries depend on their spinners.""India will begin their campaign against the UAE on September 10 in Dubai. Their high-voltage clash against Pakistan is scheduled for September 14, also in Dubai.

India A squad :

India A’s new squad for the upcoming two multi-day games against Australia A in Lucknow has brought in a fresh set of faces, while also leaving out some who were part of the earlier tour of England. The reshuffle reflects not only form and fitness but also the selectors’ intent to provide opportunities to a wider pool of players. Shreyas Iyer , left out of the Asia Cup squad and not even considered among the reserves, has been handed the captaincy. It marks a chance for him to find rhythm in longer-format cricket after a difficult run. Dhruv Jurel, who featured in the fifth Test at The Oval, remains in the setup and has been named Iyer’s deputy. KL Rahul and Mohammed Siraj will join only for the second match, providing both experience and quality ahead of India’s home Tests against the West Indies and South Africa. Rahul was India’s second-highest scorer in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, while Siraj finished as the leading wicket-taker.Shreyas Iyer (C), Abhimanyu Easwaran, N Jagadeesan (WK), Sai Sudharsan, Dhruv Jurel (VC & WK), Devdutt Padikkal, Harsh Dubey, Ayush Badoni, Nitish Reddy, Tanush Kotian, Prasidh Krishna, Gurnoor Brar, Khaleel Ahmed, Manav Suthar, Yash ThakurAmong the newcomers, Tamil Nadu’s N Jagadeesan has been rewarded after being a cover during the England Tests and backing it up with a marathon 197 in the Duleep Trophy semifinal.Delhi skipper Ayush Badoni also earns his maiden call-up along with Punjab's Gurnoor Brar.Vidarbha’s Harsh Dubey and Yash Thakur are included as well. For Dubey, this is a continuation, having also featured in the earlier England tour squad. His 69 wickets in the Ranji Trophy title run last season was a record-breaking effort.From the previous England tour squad, big names like Karun Nair, Ishan Kishan, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Mukesh Kumar, Akash Deep, Anshul Kamboj and Tushar Deshpande are missing. Karun’s absence was expected after the injury he suffered at The Oval. Sarfaraz Khan , too is unavailable, sidelined with a quadriceps injury that also ruled him out of the Duleep Trophy.On the other hand, the selectors have retained Abhimanyu Easwaran, Sai Sudharsan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Manav Suthar, and Tanush Kotian. For Reddy, this is a comeback from a knee injury suffered during India’s England tour.The bowling group now features Prasidh Krishna, Khaleel Ahmed, and Gurnoor Brar alongside Thakur.The first four-day game will be played from September 16-19, followed by the second from September 23-26 at the Ekana Stadium.","India A's new squad for the upcoming two multi-day games against Australia A in Lucknow has brought in a fresh set of faces.

A Tanzanian football match came to a dramatic standstill after an unexpected visitor disrupted play: a massive swarm of bees.The unusual incident unfolded mid-game when the swarm descended across the stadium, forcing everyone on the pitch and in the technical area to drop to the ground in an attempt to avoid being stung.Players, coaches, match officials, and even the broadcast crew were all seen lying flat as the buzzing cloud swept over the field.Watch:Footage from the match quickly spread on social media, drawing both shock and amusement from fans.One fan described it as “Football in Tanzania turned into WWE whole stadium hitting the floor for bees instead of goals,"" as another wrote: ""Never seen this type of game management at Upton Park. Bees taking more control of the midfield than most holding players I've coached. At least the lads kept their shape lying down!""Fortunately, no injuries were reported, and the bees eventually moved on, allowing the game to resume.While weather delays, power outages, or pitch invasions are not uncommon in football, incidents involving wildlife are far rarer, though Africa has seen occasional interruptions from animals such as birds, dogs, and even cows wandering into stadiums.For the players, the bee invasion was a moment of real tension, but for global audiences, it became an instant viral clip, showcasing the unpredictability of live sport.The match later continued without further disruption, but fans will likely remember the bizarre stoppage more than the final scoreline.","A massive swarm of bees disrupted a football match in Tanzania.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

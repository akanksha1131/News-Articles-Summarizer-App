Indian shuttlers have their task cut out as they brace for the 29th edition of the BWF World Badminton Championships which begins in Paris from Monday.Contrary to the Olympics where India has managed to win just three medals in badminton so far, the World Championships has proved a happy hunting ground, with the Indian shuttlers notching up 14 medals since 2011. In each edition in the last 14 years, India did not return empty-handed from the annual tournament.This time, however, the Indian shuttlers must play out of their skins to hope to be in the reckoning for a medal. Most of the players have been struggling with form, and injuries have made matters worse. That the Indians have been handed a tough draw does not make things easier.Despite the hurdles, chief national coach Pullela Gopichand is optimistic about India’s chances and hopeful of maintaining the medal-winning run at the Worlds.“We have always done well at the World Championships. I know the draw is tough this time and our players are not in the best of form. However, our experienced shuttlers have shown in the past that they can raise the bar at the right time. I am hopeful of a good show,” Gopichand told Lakshya Sen meets top-seed Shi Yu Qi of China, who has won three World Tour Super 1000 titles this season. Lakshya, the 2021 bronze medallist, had stretched the inform Chinese to three games at their last meeting in Indonesia a couple of months ago.","The 29th edition of the BWF World Badminton Championships begins in Paris from Monday.

Whenever I saw her name next to mine in the draw, I made sure I practiced harder,"" Williams said.""It's a gift to have someone who motivates you to reach those heights.

EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'

Poll Which team do you think will handle pressure better during the Asia Cup matches? India Pakistan

Legendary Pakistan fast bowler Wasim Akram has urged players and fans from both sides to keep emotions in check when India and Pakistan meet at the Asia Cup 2025 in the UAE next month.The two arch-rivals will lock horns on September 14 in Dubai, with the possibility of another clash in the Super Four on September 21 and even a third in the final.“I am sure these matches will be entertaining, just like all other India-Pakistan matches. But I hope both the players and the fans will remain disciplined and do not cross the line,” Akram told Telecom Asia Sport.Highlighting the attention these fixtures attract on a global level, the former captain said, “Games between India and Pakistan are watched by billions around the world,” calling the Asia Cup an ideal stage for fierce yet respectful competition.On the cricketing front, Akram admitted that India would start favourites given their recent form but stressed that handling pressure would decide the outcome. “If Indians are patriotic and want their team to win, the same goes for Pakistani fans. India has been in better form recently and will start as favourites, but the team that handles pressure best on the day will win,” he said.Pakistan’s youthful squad, Akram noted, has the drive to compete strongly, but he regretted the absence of one of their biggest names.“Personally, I wanted to see Babar Azam in the team, but since he’s not been selected, it’s up to those in the squad to step up,” he told Telecom Asia Sport.Looking ahead, Akram said the tournament could deliver multiple India-Pakistan contests, while expressing his long-standing wish for a return of bilateral Test cricket. “This Asia Cup will be a feast for fans worldwide. It’s my wish that India and Pakistan also resume playing a Test series. It’s been too long, and it would be a historic spectacle for fans on both sides,” he added.Reiterating his call for restraint, Akram stressed, “Fans must also show discipline,” underscoring that sportsmanship must accompany the passion of the rivalry.The Asia Cup 2025 is set to be hosted by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in September 2025, and will be played in the T20 format. The tournament will feature 8 teams and a total of 19 matches, including the final scheduled for 28th September 2025.","Wasim Akram has urged players and fans from both sides to keep emotions in check when India and Pakistan meet at the Asia Cup 2025 in the UAE next month.

Viktor Gyokeres marked his Arsenal debut with two goals as the Gunners secured a commanding 5-0 victory over Leeds at the Emirates Stadium. The win was overshadowed by injuries to Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard, just over a week before Arsenal's crucial match against Liverpool.Arsenal moved to the top of the Premier League table, ahead of Tottenham on goal difference. Both teams maintain perfect records after their opening two matches.Arsenal's management has invested £260 million on seven new players to strengthen their title aspirations, following three consecutive second-place finishes.The club's newest signing, Eberechi Eze, received a warm welcome from fans before the match. The £60 million recruit chose Arsenal over Tottenham, returning to his childhood club.Gyokeres, who joined from Sporting Lisbon, demonstrated his potential as Arsenal's new striker. The recent injuries highlighted the importance of squad depth.""We've learned the lesson from last season and the squad that you need right now,"" said Arteta. ""That is why we acted in the market the way that we have done because you have so many games, anything can happen. It happened to two of our most important players -- we already lost Kai -- so we are going to need everybody at his best and a lot of luck as well to not lose others.""Arsenal's opening goal came from a set-piece, similar to their 1-0 victory at Manchester United on the season's first weekend.Timber, who had previously scored only twice in 52 appearances, found the net from Rice's delivery after 34 minutes.Odegaard left the field following a shoulder injury from a fall. Saka then extended Arsenal's lead with a right-footed shot past goalkeeper Lucas Perri.Gyokeres, who previously attracted Leeds' interest during his time at Coventry, showed his worth despite questions about his Premier League potential. He scored after receiving Riccardo Calafiori's pass.Saka, who missed four months last season with a hamstring injury, was substituted in the 53rd minute while holding his left leg.Arsenal's fourth goal came when Timber converted from close range following another Rice corner that Leeds failed to clear.The match featured the Premier League debut of 15-year-old Max Dowman, who became the second-youngest player in English top-flight history after teammate Ethan Nwaneri.Dowman earned a penalty in stoppage time, which Gyokeres converted for his second goal.""That was special for sure,"" Arteta said about Dowman's performance.

Middle-order stalwarts Mohammad Nabi , Gulbadin Naib, Karim Janat, and Mujeeb Ur Rahman provide balance, while top-order batters Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Ibrahim Zadran, and Darwish Rasooli are expected to anchor the innings.Other notable names include Sediqullah Atal, Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Ishaq, and Allah Ghazanfar, who have shown promise in domestic and international T20 competitions.

AB de Villiers answers why SA20 survived while other South Africa T20 leagues failed

Poll Would you have the courage to ask for a picture with your idol? Yes, definitely! Maybe, if I was feeling brave. No, I would feel too nervous.

South Africa’s young batting sensation Dewald Brevis has shared a heartwarming story of how he first met his idol AB de Villiers . Brevis admitted that he was so nervous at the time that he could barely muster the courage to ask for a picture, but eventually, the meeting changed the course of his cricket journey.Brevis, who made his international debut against Australia in August 2023 and has since represented his country in 14 matches across formats, has long been compared to de Villiers. His ability to play innovative strokes and his striking resemblance to the South African great have earned him the nickname ‘Baby AB’.Speaking to SuperSport, Brevis recalled spotting de Villiers at a restaurant while out with his family. “AB and his wife walked past us and I just froze. I wanted to ask for a picture but I couldn’t get the words out. Then his wife said, ‘AB, come for a picture,’ and that’s how I got my first photo with him,” Brevis said.A few days later, Brevis got another chance at a school event. “Someone told us AB was at the school and we rushed to see him. I was still star-struck and could hardly say anything. As he was about to leave, I suddenly asked, ‘AB, you can say no, but can I please have your number.’ He gave it to me, and later I sent him a message just to thank him,” Brevis revealed.That simple exchange turned into a lasting bond. With the world soon going into lockdown, Brevis and de Villiers stayed in touch, and what began as an idol-fan moment gradually evolved into a mentor-mentee relationship.","South Africa’s young batting sensation Dewald Brevis has shared a heartwarming story of how he first met his idol AB de Villiers.

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have combined to win the last seven major titles — a streak that ranks fourth among the longest in the Open Era. And it is tough to find someone in the men's draw who can disrupt this spell at the US Open, which gets underway on Sunday.Their run, which started at 2024 Australian Open, is only behind Roger Federer-RafaelNadal (11), Nadal-Novak Djokovic (9) and Djokovic-Nadal (9). Victory for either in two weeks will not only extend that streak but ensure two consecutive years where the Spaniard or the Italian have lifted the trophy at a major.If Federer, Nadal and Djokovic were attributed to have wiped out an entire generation of players, we might be witnessing much of the same being repeated now. Large credit, then and now, to the players concerned, was due to their consistency on all three surfaces.Jannik Sinner has clinched the last three hard-court majors — the 2024 and 2025 Australian Opens and the 2024 US Open. Carlos Alcaraz, meanwhile, has ruled Wimbledon in 2023 and 2024, and lifted the French Open in both 2024 and 2025.Paris this year marked the first time the duopoly reached the grandest stage: a Slam final.In that thriller, Alcaraz saved three championship points before prevailing. It was one of four meetings between them in the last four months, all in finals. Should they meet again at Flushing Meadows, the stakes will be nothing less than the trophy and the world No. 1 ranking.The rivalry, nicknamed ‘Sincaraz’, has already produced 14 chapters. One of its finest came at the 2022 US Open, when Alcaraz edged Sinner in a 5hr 15min quarter-final that ended at 2:50am.The latest instalment, however, was more muted. In the Cincinnati Open final, Alcaraz stormed to a 5-0 lead before Sinner retired with a virus. That ended the Italian’s 26-match hard-court winning streak — his previous defeat also at the hands of Alcaraz.The Spaniard, meanwhile, has been in blistering form: a tour-leading six titles this season and 39 wins from his last 41 matches.Sinner, now back to full health, welcomed the rivalry on Media Day. “Me and Carlos, we’re sharing big trophies, but at the same time, things can change,” said the top-ranked Italian on Friday.Alcaraz was just as generous. “Thanks to him, I bring my best tennis in the match,” he said in Cincinnati. “I think for the people, too, it’s great watching our matches. As we’ve said many, many times, we raise our level to the top and bring really beautiful tennis in these matches.”Sinner is also chasing history of his own: to become the first man to defend the US Open title since Roger Federer’s five-in-a-row streak from 2004 to 2008.Between them, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have captured nine of the last 12 majors. The other three belong to Novak Djokovic. Yet even the Serb, with his 24 Grand Slam titles, finds himself cast as an outsider to the new duopoly.“I kind of empathise with the third guy, because I was in those shoes with Federer and Nadal,” Djokovic said with a smile. “I want to see a third guy coming in.”Could that “third guy” still be him? Djokovic, a four-time US Open champion, is chasing a record-extending 25th major. But since winning here in 2023, he has reached just one Grand Slam final.The 38-year-old admitted his motivation now centres exclusively on the Slams. That approach has been underscored by his absence from tour events since a semi-final defeat to Alcaraz at Wimbledon.With age and injuries catching up — a hamstring issue at the Australian Open and a thigh problem at Wimbledon — the extended break may prove timely.His campaign in New York begins against American youngster Learner Tien, who upset Daniil Medvedev in Melbourne earlier this year. The road ahead could feature tough hurdles in Frances Tiafoe, Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, and, inevitably, Alcaraz.“When it comes to individual sports like ours or boxing, Formula 1, golf, people love to see rivalries,” Novak Djokovic said about ‘Sincaraz’. “I think their rivalry is, without a doubt, the best one we have at the moment. And it looks like it's going to stay like that for some time.“And then you have obviously other young players that are definitely going to challenge them, and hopefully somebody can get in the mix. There are players that are able to have that joker spot, the third spot,” he added.Djokovic, of course, holds that ‘joker card’ himself. But there are others who could give Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz a run for their money. Chief among them is World No. 6 Ben Shelton.The 22-year-old American brings just what home fans crave — a booming serve, electric energy, breathtaking shot-making and plenty of flair. To cap it off, he celebrates with bicep curls and a mock ‘hang-up-the-phone’ routine after his wins.“I think I'm an entertainer at heart. I’m never going to be the guy who is able to robotically go about my business and not change expression or show any emotion. I think that I play better when I do show some emotion,"" he said on Friday.But the challenge at the US Open is immense. The last American man to win a major singles title was Andy Roddick at this very event in 2003. Taylor Fritz came closest last year, reaching the final before falling to Sinner — the first American man in 15 years to contest a Slam title match.Shelton’s road is no easier this time. He could run into Alcaraz in the quarterfinals and Sinner in the final. Against the two, his record in majors this year reads 0-3.“Frustrating,” Shelton admitted. “Two very different players and challenges,” he added of the ‘Sincaraz’ threat.Others lurking in the draw include three-time Grand Slam finalist Alexander Zverev, 2021 US Open champion Daniil Medvedev, and Fritz.World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka has collected three titles on the WTA Tour this season, the joint-most. She lifted the Miami and Madrid Opens, while finishing runner-up at Indian Wells and Stuttgart. With 50 match wins, she leads the tour and also tops the Race to the WTA Finals.What eludes her is the one prize that matters most — a Grand Slam. Her bid for a Melbourne three-peat ended painfully against Madison Keys, followed by an early exit at the French Open and a semi-final defeat at Wimbledon.That has only steeled the Belarussian’s resolve to defend her US Open crown. Victory in New York would place her alongside greats. The last woman to win back-to-back US Opens was Serena Williams, who captured three in a row between 2012 and 2014.“My thought is to change that,” said the 27-year-old. “But, wow, that’s insane, you know, how unpredictable women’s tennis is, right? Should we change it? Should we try at least to change it?”After Wimbledon, Sabalenka skipped Montreal to rest. She returned in Cincinnati, but went down in straight sets to Elena Rybakina in the quarterfinals. Despite that, she insists the mood is upbeat.As the top seed, Sabalenka could run into USA’s Coco Gauff in the semi-finals — a repeat of last year’s final and their French Open clash earlier this season.But her biggest challenge may come from Poland’s Iga Swiatek, who enters New York brimming with confidence. The second seed followed up her maiden Wimbledon triumph with victory in Cincinnati and a run to the mixed doubles final here.Swiatek, who beat Sabalenka en route to her 2022 US Open crown, barely paused after Cincinnati. Hours later, she was in New York, shrugging off fatigue to partner Casper Ruud in the mixed doubles, where they finished runners-up to Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori.On the eve of the US Open, Coco Gauff has made a bold move, bringing biomechanics expert Gavin MacMillan into her corner. MacMillan, who previously worked with Aryna Sabalenka on her serve, joins at a time when Gauff’s own delivery is under heavy scrutiny.The 21-year-old American leads the WTA Tour in double faults this season — 320, well ahead of Jelena Ostapenko’s 211. The numbers have been stark: 42 double faults across three matches in Montreal, including a staggering 23 in a single outing. In Cincinnati, she handed Jasmine Paolini 16 free points the same way.“Gavin became available. I just felt this was the best decision for my game at least and I had to go with what I was feeling,” Gauff said. Since winning the French Open, she has managed a modest 5-4 record.While the timing of the change — days before a Slam — raised eyebrows, Gauff insisted the call was about the bigger picture. On a rain-hit Wednesday, she was already grinding on her serve with her team.“A tournament is a tournament. I hate losing regardless of where I am,” she said. “I hope I can get it all together — I think I'll play either Monday or Tuesday — by then. If not, I have the rest of this year to work on it.“But I do know I needed to make a change, technical change to it, and I don't want to waste time continuing doing the wrong things.”Gauff's first test of her serve would come against a tricky opponent in Australia's Alja Tomljanovic, someone who has the experience of dealing with crowd favourites having sent Serena packing in her last-ever US Open appearance.","Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have combined to win the last seven major titles — a streak that ranks fourth among the longest in the Open Era. Victory for either in two weeks will not only extend that streak but ensure two consecutive years where the Spaniard or the Italian have lifted the trophy at a major.

Poll Do you believe women's cricket is finally stepping out of men's cricket's shadow? Absolutely Somewhat Not really Not at all

Women’s World Cup ‘a big opportunity’ for India

Women’s cricket is no longer waiting in the wings. From packed stadiums in Australia for the 2020 T20 World Cup final to the advent of the Women’s Premier League (WPL) in India, the sport has stepped out of men’s cricket’s shadow to command its own space.The numbers tell the story as well. The opening match of WPL 2025 drew over 3 crore TV viewers. That was after Rs 951 crore ($116 million) were spent on WPL’s media rights, making it the second most expensive women’s league after WNBA.In India especially, where sport has often mirrored societal shifts, women’s cricket is becoming both a professional pursuit and a cultural movement.“It’s one of those very important milestones for women’s cricket in India because it’s played a very vital role in the growth of the sport. You see a lot of young players being identified by franchises as young as about 17-18 years old, and they invest in these players,” said Mithali Raj about the tournament at the Economic Times World Leaders Forum in conversation with K Shriniwas Rao, Head of Sports Content at Times Internet.“In terms of sponsorship, it helps the players, because once you start representing a franchise, once you start playing for them, you’re on television, so there you attract sponsor deals as well, whether it is ads or for your equipment,” she added.Sat alongside her, ICC CEO Sanjog Gupta provided perspective from another side. “What the WPL is doing for Indian women’s cricket and cricket in general, is what IPL did for men’s cricket.The expansion of the opportunity, to get the kind of exposure and also having it as a viable career option beyond the 15-20 players who play for India, is itself galvanising enough and more people to believe that it’s genuinely an opportunity worth pursuing,” he said.The next big opportunity for women’s cricket to showcase and make the most of its platform comes in the form of the World Cup which starts on September 30.Mithali, who carried Indian batting for two decades, called the home World Cup a “big opportunity”.“They’ve been doing really well in the one-day format. Australia remain the toughest opposition, but with the preparation BCCI has ensured — strong bilateral series, good quality opposition — India does have a very good chance,” she said.Asked about her prediction, Raj tipped India to reach the final and play Australia for the title. “India-Australia in the final,” she said with a smile.",Women's cricket is no longer waiting in the wings.

Indian cricket has produced many players who have worn down the opposition with patience, grit, and determination. Test cricket is not just a game of skill; it also demands resilience and mental toughness under challenging conditions.Recently, Cheteshwar Pujara , India’s modern-day Test stalwart, announced his retirement from international cricket. His legacy in the red-ball format, however, remains untarnished. Over the years, Pujara has shown what it takes to stay at the crease for long periods, and he joins a prestigious list of Indian players who have faced the most deliveries in a single Test innings.Legendary opener Sunil Gavaskar takes the fifth spot with his marathon 172 against England in Bengaluru. Batting in the second Test of the series, Gavaskar faced 472 deliveries and struck 19 boundaries to help India post 428 in response to England’s 400. The match ended in a hard-fought draw, and Gavaskar was named player of the match for his vital contribution.Former all-rounder and head coach Ravi Shastri is next, with a memorable 206 against Australia in Sydney.India responded strongly to Australia’s 313, compiling 483, with Shastri’s innings featuring 17 boundaries and two sixes. He also took four wickets later in the match, earning the player of the match award in a game that ended in a draw.Sidhu claimed the third spot with his 201 against the West Indies. India built a massive lead of 436 after the West Indies scored 296, thanks to Sidhu’s patient innings with 19 boundaries and a six. Though the match ended in a draw, his knock exhausted the opposition and highlighted the importance of resilience alongside attacking strokes.The dependable wall, Rahul Dravid, comes in second with an iconic 270 against Pakistan in Rawalpindi. India amassed 600 runs after Pakistan scored 224, with Dravid facing 495 deliveries and hitting 34 boundaries at a strike rate of 54.54. India secured a massive innings and 131-run victory, with Dravid earning the player of the match award for his remarkable effort.At the top of the list is Cheteshwar Pujara, India’s modern-day wall. In the third Test against Australia in Ranchi, Pujara faced 525 deliveries to score 202 runs while India declared at 603 for nine in reply to Australia’s 451. The match ended in a draw after Australia battled hard, but Pujara’s innings was a display of sheer concentration and stamina. With Pujara now retired, it remains to be seen if any upcoming Indian batter can challenge his record of facing 525 balls in a single Test innings.","Cteshwar Pujara has faced the most deliveries in a single Test innings.

What does the horoscope of struggling Prithvi Shaw say?

Poll Do you think Prithvi Shaw can maintain consistency in the upcoming season? Yes, definitely Maybe No, unlikely

NEW DELHI: India batter Prithvi Shaw continued to keep the spotlight on himself with another promising knock for Maharashtra ahead of the 2025-26 domestic season. The 25-year-old, who switched allegiance from Mumbai earlier this year, struck a solid half-century in the Buchi Babu Invitational Tournament against TNCA President’s XI, following up his debut century for his new side just a few days earlier.Since moving to Maharashtra, Shaw has shown glimpses of his old flair, posting two fifty-plus scores in three innings. He had kicked off with a fighting 111 against Chhattisgarh on a challenging turner, where his teammates combined for just 92 runs.At the Gojan Cricket Ground ‘B’, Shaw appeared determined to build on that century. Resuming his overnight score of 47 off 57 balls against TNCA President’s XI, Shaw reached his half-century in style with a backfoot punch for three on the very first delivery of the day. He went on to share a crucial 94-run partnership with Harshal Kate, laying a strong foundation for Maharashtra’s reply.Shaw’s fluent 66 off 96 deliveries, decorated with crisp boundaries and positive intent, once again reminded of his natural attacking instincts. But just as Maharashtra looked comfortable at 155/2, Achyuth C V got him out to trigger a mini-collapse. Kate, who made 62, followed soon after, leaving Maharashtra tottering at 159/4.For Shaw, the innings further reinforces his comeback trail after a difficult 2024-25 season marred by fitness issues, disciplinary concerns, and the disappointment of going unsold at the IPL auction. With two substantial knocks already in Maharashtra colours, he will be keen to convert promise into consistency as the new season looms.","The 25-year-old struck a solid half-century in the Buchi Babu Invitational Tournament against TNCA President’s XI.

Australia’s Cooper Connolly marked his arrival on the big stage with a record-breaking five-wicket haul as the hosts demolished South Africa by 276 runs in the third ODI at Mackay on Sunday.The 22-year-old left-arm spinner tore through the Proteas’ middle order, finishing with 5/22 in six overs. His haul made him the youngest Australian to claim an ODI five-for, surpassing Craig McDermott, who achieved the feat at 22 years and 204 days in 1987.Connolly’s spell featured decisive moments throughout the innings. He removed Tony de Zorzi with a half-tracker pulled straight to Alex Carey. Dewald Brevis, after a defiant 49, was denied his half-century when he picked out Cameron Green in the deep.Wiaan Mulder was next, falling to a diving catch by Marnus Labuschagne. Corbin Bosch too perished to Labuschagne, while Keshav Maharaj was stumped by Josh Inglis to seal Connolly’s maiden fifer.Australia had earlier piled up a towering 431/2 after choosing to bat. Openers Travis Head (142) and Mitchell Marsh (100) put on a 250-run stand, while Cameron Green added fireworks with a 47-ball century. Alex Carey chipped in with an unbeaten 50 off 37 balls.The blitz made Australia only the second side in ODI history to see their top three all score hundreds in the same innings.South Africa, chasing a mountain, crumbled to 155 all out. Wiaan Mulder endured a nightmare, conceding 93 runs from seven overs — one of the most expensive spells in ODI history for a bowler delivering six or more overs.While the Proteas had already secured the series ahead of this game, the day belonged to Connolly, who walked away with the ball raised high and a smile that matched his milestone.","Cooper Connolly takes record-breaking five-wicket haul as Australia beat South Africa by 276 runs in third ODI.

Poll What do you think about the three centuries in a single ODI innings by Australia? It's an incredible achievement! Impressive, but it came in a consolation win I don't think it's that significant

Dewald Brevis may have lit up the Great Barrier Reef Arena with a fiery knock, but it was a fan’s mischievous moment in the stands that stole the spotlight.The incident unfolded in the 11th over of South Africa’s chase when Brevis launched Xavier Bartlett for consecutive sixes. One of those strikes sailed over the fence, sparking a scramble among spectators. A young fan reached the ball first and decided to have some fun with it.After picking up the ball, he continued running away from the stadium, before abruptly cutting his run short. He then tucked the ball under his shirt, and appeared to fake a throw back onto the field, even fooling the cameras for a moment. He eventually tossed it back, but not before his sly reaction had gone viral across social media platforms.Brevis, who scored a quick 49 off 28 balls with those back-to-back sixes, was later dismissed by Cameron Green off Cooper Connolly. His effort, however, wasn’t enough as South Africa fell well short in pursuit of a mammoth target.Australia had earlier posted a record 431/2, powered by centuries from Travis Head (142), Mitchell Marsh (100) and Cameron Green (118*). The innings marked only the second time in men’s ODI history that the top three of a team registered hundreds in the same innings.The hosts’ dominance continued with the ball. Sean Abbott and Bartlett struck early before 22-year-old Connolly ran through the middle and lower order, claiming 5-22 – becoming the youngest from his country to get a five-wicket haul. South Africa were bowled out for 155, conceding a 276-run defeat.Despite the heavy loss, the Proteas clinched the series 2-1. But for fans, it was Brevis’ towering hit and the young spectator’s playful “ball theft” that provided one of the most talked-about moments of the match.","Dewald Brevis smashed two consecutive sixes in South Africa's chase.

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has been appointed as head coach of SA20 franchise Pretoria Capitals ahead of the 2026 season.

We are ecstatic to announce Sourav Ganguly as our new head coach,” the franchise posted on Instagram.Ganguly, who also served as BCCI president between 2019 and 2022, has previously worked in team management roles but never as head coach. In the IPL, he was team director of Delhi Capitals between 2018 and 2019 before vacating the position upon taking charge at the BCCI.Pretoria Capitals, like their IPL namesake Delhi Capitals, are owned by JSW Sports. Ganguly was appointed as the group’s director of cricket last year, strengthening his association with the owners before now stepping into the dugout for the South African league.The move comes after a difficult season for the Capitals. Under Trott, who took charge ahead of the 2025 edition, the team managed only two wins in 10 group games, finishing fifth in the six-team table and missing out on the knockouts.On Saturday, the franchise paid tribute to their outgoing coach. “Jonathan Trott, forever grateful for your leadership and unwavering dedication to the team. All the best on your next adventure! Once a Capital, always a Capital!” the club wrote on social media.With Ganguly at the helm, Pretoria will hope for a turnaround in fortunes in the 2026 season.

Everton marked the opening of their new home at Bramley-Moore Dock with a 2-0 win over Brighton on Sunday, a match that also saw Jack Grealish deliver a standout performance on his first Premier League start for the club.On loan from Manchester City, Grealish provided two assists, which was surprisingly as many as he managed across the last two league campaigns combined at City.

The goal carried symbolic weight as well, with Ndiaye having scored Everton’s final goal at Goodison Park before the shift to the new home stadium.Grealish’s influence continued when he laid the ball off for James Garner, whose long-range strike sealed the result.

The Argentina Football Association (AFA) has confirmed that the national team will visit Kerala for a friendly match in November.According to the AFA’s statement on Saturday, the Argentine team, under the guidance of coach Lionel Scaloni, has two remaining FIFA match dates in 2025. The first is set for October 6th to 14th in the United States, with details of opponents and cities yet to be finalised.“The Argentine team led by Lionel Scaloni will have two friendly FIFA match dates remaining in 2025. The first will be in October, from the 6th to the 14th, taking place in the United States (opponents and cities to be determined). The second, the November FIFA date, from the 10th to the 18th, will be held in Luanda, Angola, and Kerala, India (opponents to be determined),” read the AFA statement.Interestingly, the AFA’s statement did not mention Lionel Messi or details about the national squad.However, Kerala’s sports minister, V Abdurahiman, confirmed that Lionel Messi will be part of the team traveling to Kerala in November. “The Argentinian national football team has announced that they will play in Kerala in November during the FIFA window. The team that won the World Cup under Lionel Messi, the whole squad will play here,” he told reporters.The minister’s office clarified that the state government has no financial obligations or involvement in bringing the Argentina team, as a private news channel is sponsoring the event. “It was the state govt which initially invited Argentina to Kerala. But currently the govt does not have any responsibilities regarding the development,” the minister’s office said.It is understood that Football Australia, the national football federation of Australia, has expressed interest in being Argentina’s opponent, though organizers are considering other options. “Argentina prefers to play against a side within the top-50 of FIFA rankings. They have asked us to submit a list of rivals, and the AFA will make the final decision,” said a source familiar with the developments.Thiruvananthapuram is the leading candidate to host the Argentina friendly in November, with the Greenfield Stadium as the potential venue. However, the Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) has a lease agreement and manages the stadium, making it unlikely they would allow a football match, especially after losing the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Kochi to the Indian Super League (ISL).“We have no information about any football team from Argentina coming to Kerala. Once we receive confirmation from the state government, we can plan our course of action. So, the question of preparing the stadium in Thiruvananthapuram does not arise at the moment,” said Vinod S Kumar, KCA secretary.If the state government applies pressure on KCA, they might permit hosting the football match at Greenfield Stadium.Hosting the Argentina friendly in Kochi is almost out of the question, as the venue does not meet FIFA standards. Although most of Kerala’s football fans are from the northern part of the state, including Malappuram, the region lacks a world-class football stadium. Both the EMS Corporation Stadium in Kozhikode, where Gokulam Kerala play their I-League matches, and the Sports Council Stadium in Manjeri would require significant renovations to host the match.","The Argentina Football Association has confirmed that the national team will visit Kerala for a friendly match in November. The first is set for October 6th to 14th in the United States, with details of opponents and cities yet to be finalised. The second, the November FIFA date, will be held in Luanda, Angola, and Kerala, India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123480730,imgsize-117590,width-400,resizemode-4/123480730.jpg"

Barcelona secured a thrilling 3-2 victory at Levante in the Spanish league on Saturday, overcoming a two-goal deficit. The defending champions mounted their comeback through goals from Pedri González and Ferran Torres in the second half after newly promoted Levante had established a surprising lead at halftime.The winning goal came late in the match when Lamine Yamal's curling cross into the six-yard box resulted in an own goal by Levante's Unai Elgezabal.Levante had taken an early lead in the 15th minute through Iván Romero, capitalising on a counterattack following a ball lost by Yamal. They extended their advantage when José Luis Morales converted a penalty in first-half injury time, awarded after VAR identified a handball by Alejandro Balde.Pedri initiated Barcelona's recovery in the 49th minute, receiving a pass from Yamal outside the area before scoring with a powerful long-range shot into the corner of the net.Ferran, who had previously hit the woodwork in the first half, equalised in the 52nd minute by holding off his defender and volleying in Raphinha's corner kick.Barcelona's persistence paid off when Yamal's contribution led to the decisive goal just after the 90-minute mark.""The first goal we scored helped us a lot to get our confidence in the box, but until the end it was not easy for us to get the three points,"" said Barcelona coach Hansi Flick.The victory followed Barcelona's 3-0 win against nine-man Mallorca in their season opener.Marcus Rashford made his first league start for Barcelona since his loan move from Manchester United, playing as a left-side forward. He was substituted at halftime by Dani Olmo, after a first half dominated by Pedri's midfield passing and Yamal's right-wing attacks.""I think Marcus had some situations in the first half where he showed how good he is and how he can help us, and that is how we have to continue,"" Flick said. Robert Lewandowski made his season debut as a late substitute after recovering from a muscle injury.In other league action, Atletico Madrid struggled for the second consecutive match, drawing 1-1 with promoted Elche at home.Despite strengthening their squad during the summer transfer window, Diego Simeone's team has collected just one point from their opening matches.Alexander Sorloth gave Atletico an early lead in the eighth minute, converting David Hancko's pass with a well-executed looping strike.Elche responded quickly, with Rafa Mir equalising in the 15th minute following an assist from German Valera.""We are working hard to get the most out of our players,"" Simeone said. ""With patience and work, the results will come. We can't change course because we had two games that we deserved, at least, not to lose.""Elche, coming from southeastern Spain, had previously drawn 1-1 with Real Betis in their opening match.The day's action concluded with Mallorca and Celta Vigo sharing points in a 1-1 draw.",Barcelona beat Levante 3-2 in Spanish league.

Defending champions NorthEast United FC produced a stunning display of attacking football to dismantle debutants Diamond Harbour FC 6-1 in the final of the 134th Durand Cup at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan on Saturday. With six different players on target and talisman Alaaeddine Ajaraie running the show with three assists and a late penalty, the Highlanders sealed back-to-back titles in emphatic fashion — the first team in 25 years to do so.Diamond Harbour’s lone reply came in the 68th minute when Jobby Justin’s header took a deflection off Luka Majcen. By then, though, the contest was long tilted in NorthEast’s favour.Coach Juan Pedro Benali’s side stuck to their trusted 4-3-3 formation, with Parthib Gogoi and Huidom Thoi Singh joining Ajaraie up front. Skipper Miguel Zabaco marshalled the backline, while Spaniards Andy Gaitan and Chema Nunez dictated the tempo in midfield.After a cautious start, NorthEast broke through on the half-hour mark when centre-back Asheer Akhtar pounced on a loose ball from a corner to score. Just before the break, Parthib Gogoi curled home a fine finish to double the lead, leaving Diamond Harbour chasing shadows.The second half saw the champions step on the accelerator. Ajaraie turned provider for Thoi Singh in the 50th minute before Majcen’s fortuitous strike briefly lifted the debutants’ hopes. But substitute Jairo’s thunderous effort in the 81st minute snuffed out any chance of a fightback. Andy and Ajaraie added two more goals late on to complete the rout — also equalling the joint-highest margin of victory in a Durand Cup final since 1896.Ajaraie’s heroics saw him walk away with both the Golden Boot (8 goals) and Golden Ball, while Gurmeet picked up the Golden Glove. NorthEast swept all individual awards, underlining their dominance.As the players lifted the trophy in front of a jubilant crowd, the night marked not just another triumph for the Highlanders, but also a statement that their reign in Indian football’s oldest competition remains unchallenged.","Defending champions NorthEast United FC produced a stunning display of attacking football to dismantle debutants Diamond Harbour FC 6-1 in the final of the 134th Durand Cup.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

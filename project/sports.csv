BENGALURU: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), perennial slow starters and a side that has too often flattered only to fizzle when it matters, have been a revelation in this Indian Premier League (IPL) so far. As beginnings go, theirs has been pristinely new.Under new captain Rajat Patidar, they have begun impeccably, notching up big wins against Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings. They now have a more balanced side with a competent bowling attack — a bugbear in previous years — complementing a confident batting unit.RCB play the first of their home matches against Gujarat Titans at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Wednesday and, given how often they have let down fans, it’s hard not to conjure up the fate that befell their women’s team recently. After a sizzling start in the Women’s Premier League, the defending champions led by Smriti Mandhana lost four consecutive matches at home and crashed out in the league phase.Although the men don’t play that many home matches on the trot, they will have to tread carefully at their home ground, a known batting paradise given its small boundaries.One of their biggest assets is the new-ball bowling pair of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Josh Hazlewood, old warhorses intimately familiar with conditions in Bengaluru. The city holds a special place for Bhuvneshwar, who cut his teeth in T20 international cricket at this venue against Pakistan in 2012.Hazlewood has been immaculate in the two games so far in the 18th edition of the IPL, a luxury that has helped Patidar channel his bowling options around the veteran Australian. Apart from the seasoned pacers, RCB have the option of playing either Yash Dayal (most likely) or Rasikh Salam. RCB’s all-rounders Krunal Pandya, Liam Livingstone and Suyash Sharma for the crux of their spin department.RCB’s batting lies in its top-order led by the red-hot Phil Salt and Virat Kohli, who is still warming up to the league. With in-form skipper Patidar offering stability, Devdutt Padikkal, Jitesh Sharma and Tim David lend depth to the line-up which will be a worry for any opposition.The Titans, on the other hand, have had a mixed start to their campaign. After a heartbreaking 11-run loss to Punjab Kings in the opener, they recovered to outplay Mumbai Indians by 36 runs in Ahmedabad over the weekend.Helmed by the ‘prince’ of Indian cricket, Shubman Gill, the Titans have a potent batting line-up which includes Sai Sudharsan, Gill, Jos Buttler, Shahrukh Khan, Rahul Tewatia and Sherfane Rutherford. If the RCB bowlers are to have an off-day, Titans have enough ammunition to light up the compact stadium.At the Chinnaswamy, RCB will be wary of the Titans’ bowling attack. Mohammed Siraj has spent the better part of his IPL career at the venue before the Bengaluru outfit let go off him before the mega auction. Then, there is the expertise of home boy Prasidh Krishna and the experience of Ishant Sharma to go with the class of Kagiso Rabada. With Rashid Khan and Sai Kishore also in the frame, the Titans have a better spin attack compared to the hosts.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) have been a revelation in this Indian Premier League (IPL) so far.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians ’ young left-arm pacer Ashwani Kumar made an unforgettable IPL debut against Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday, delivering a record-breaking performance at the Wankhede Stadium. Kumar’s sensational 4 for 24 helped MI bundle out KKR for just 116 in 16.2 overs — the lowest total in this IPL season.The 23-year-old from a town called Jhanjeri, near Chandigarh, became the first Indian to take four wickets on an IPL debut, etching his name in the history books. He joins an elite list of bowlers with standout performances on their first IPL outing, including Alzarri Joseph (6/12) and Andrew Tye (5/17).Also See: MI vs KKR Live Ashwani struck with his very first ball in the IPL, dismissing KKR captain Ajinkya Rahane.

I didn’t have lunch today, I only ate a banana, there was some pressure so I didn’t feel hungry. The captain, Hardik bhai, told me to bowl it into the wicket and back my skills. Everyone back in my village will be watching me play, and I’m very happy.”With just four senior T20 matches, two Ranji Trophy, and four List A games under his belt before this, Ashwani’s impact on debut signals a bright future ahead for the young pacer and Mumbai Indians.",Ashwani Kumar becomes first Indian to take four wickets on an IPL debut.

LSG vs PBKS IPL 2025, Lucknow weather prediction

The Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) will seek their first home victory of the season when they face Punjab Kings (PBKS) at the Ekana International Stadium in Lucknow today (April 1).Captain Rishabh Pant aims to make an impact after LSG narrowly lost their season opener to Delhi Capitals by one wicket in Vizag. However, they rebounded strongly with a five-wicket win over Sunrisers Hyderabad, driven by standout performances from Nicholas Pooran (70 runs), Mitchell Marsh (55 runs), and Shardul Thakur (4/34), who excelled with the ball.LSG's top order has been firing, with Marsh and Pooran laying a solid foundation. Aiden Markram, like Pant, had a disappointing performance and will be eager to improve.Pant, the most expensive player in the IPL auction last year at Rs 27 crore, is under pressure after a lacklustre showing in the first two matches. A strong performance at home would certainly help alleviate some of that burden.Abdul Samad also shone against SRH, scoring 22 runs off just eight balls, while Shardul Thakur, who stepped in for Mohsin Khan, has performed well with the ball. LSG has chosen to field three spinners on the slow Ekana pitch, with hopes resting on Ravi Bishnoi.For Punjab, seasoned leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal will lead the spin attack, and Glenn Maxwell is also expected to contribute with the ball. This match features an intriguing matchup between the most expensive and second-most expensive players in IPL history.In contrast to Pant’s struggles, Shreyas Iyer , purchased for Rs 26.75 crore, shone by scoring a match-winning 97 not out off 42 balls against the Gujarat Titans. The IPL-winning captain enjoys his role at No. 3, enhancing Punjab's batting strength.Don't expect a high-scoring affair when LSG meet PBKS at the Ekana Cricket Stadium . As one of India’s larger grounds it could give some respite to the bowlers. Records suggests plenty of support for the spinners and an even show of bat and ball. The slow surface will favour the spinners. Batters will have to rotate strike regularly and bank on powerplay for the big runs.Punjab Kings: Prabhsimran Singh (w), Priyansh Arya, Shreyas Iyer (c), Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Glenn Maxwell, Suryansh Shedge, Azmatullah Omarzai, Marco Jansen, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra ChahalImpact Sub: Vijaykumar VyshakLucknow Super Giants: Mitchell Marsh, Aiden Markram, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh Pant(w/c), Ayush Badoni, David Miller, Shahbaz Ahmed, Shardul Thakur, Ravi Bishnoi, Avesh Khan, Prince YadavImpact Sub: Digvesh RathiPunjab Kings squad: Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh(w), Shreyas Iyer(c), Azmatullah Omarzai, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Shashank Singh, Suryansh Shedge, Marco Jansen, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra Chahal, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Nehal Wadhera, Praveen Dubey, Harpreet Brar, Vishnu Vinod, Yash Thakur, Aaron Hardie, Kuldeep Sen, Harnoor Singh, Musheer Khan, Pyla Avinash, Xavier Bartlett, Lockie Ferguson, Josh Inglis.Lucknow Super Giants squad: Aiden Markram, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh Pant(w/c), Ayush Badoni, David Miller, Abdul Samad, Shardul Thakur, Ravi Bishnoi, Avesh Khan, Digvesh Singh Rathi, Prince Yadav, Mitchell Marsh, Manimaran Siddharth, Himmat Singh, Akash Maharaj Singh, Shahbaz Ahmed, Matthew Breetzke, Aryan Juyal, RS Hangargekar, Yuvraj Chaudhary, Akash Deep, Mayank Yadav, Shamar Joseph, Arshin Kulkarni.LSG and PBKS have squared off only four times in the IPL. LSG have won three of them while PBKS have come out victorious once. Last year's clash was won by LSG by 21 runs. PBKS' solitary triumph had come in the 2023 season.Lucknow is expected to be warm and dry during the match between LSG and PBKS with temperatures in and around 30 degrees Celsius.

Punjab's bowling attack, spearheaded by Arshdeep Singh 's impressive figures of 3/43, effectively restricted Lucknow's scoring opportunities.Despite losing Mitchell Marsh for a golden duck and captain Rishabh Pant for a meager two runs, Lucknow found some stability through a 31-run partnership between Aiden Markram (28) and Nicholas Pooran (44).However, it was the partnership between Pooran and Ayush Badoni (41) that truly resurrected the innings.Late cameos from David Miller (19) and Abdul Samad (27) helped Lucknow surpass the 150-run mark.Punjab's chase got off to a flying start, courtesy of opener Prabhsimran Singh's blistering 69 off 34 balls. Singh and Iyer combined for a dominant 84-run partnership in just 44 balls, effectively dismantling Lucknow's bowling attack.Although Singh fell to wrist spinner Digvesh Rathi (2/30) in the 11th over, the damage had been done.Iyer continued his aggressive approach, reaching his half-century off just 30 balls, smashing three fours and four sixes in the process.Impact player Nehal Wadhera provided the finishing touches, smashing an unbeaten 43 off 25 balls, including four sixes. Together, Iyer and Wadhera forged an unbeaten 67-run partnership off just 37 balls, sealing a comprehensive victory for Punjab.This win propels Punjab Kings to second place in the points table, trailing only the Royal Challengers Bengaluru on net run rate.Lucknow Super Giants, on the other hand, find themselves in sixth place after this defeat.

Pakistan have been fined 10 percent of their match fee for maintaining a slow over-rate in the first One-Day International against New Zealand at Napier on Saturday.""Jeff Crowe of the ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees imposed the sanction after Mohammad Rizwan ’s side was ruled to be two overs short of the target after time allowances were taken into consideration,"" the ICC said in a release on Tuesday.As per Article 2.22 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which pertains to minimum over-rate offenses, players are fined five percent of their match fees for every over their side fails to bowl within the allotted time.Rizwan accepted the offense and the proposed sanction, eliminating the need for a formal hearing. The charge was leveled by on-field umpires Chris Brown and Paul Reiffel, third umpire Michael Gough, and fourth umpire Wayne Knights.Mark Chapman played a career-best knock of 132 off 111 balls to steer New Zealand to a 73-run win in the first ODI at McLean Park.

NEW DELHI: Every year, franchises spend massive amounts on players to secure their services. While some players shine, others fail to live up to expectations. Even renowned names sometimes find themselves on the list of underperformers.This season's IPL is no exception, with a few big names making it to that unwanted list.The costliest player of the IPL 2025 mega auction Rishabh Pant, is struggling to find form with the bat. Bought for a staggering Rs 27 crore by Lucknow Super Giants and entrusted with the captaincy, Pant has failed to deliver as expected. In three matches so far, he has managed only 15 runs at a disappointing average of 7.50.Former Mumbai Indians captain Rohit Sharma, the most successful skipper in the franchise’s history with five IPL titles, was retained for Rs 16.30 crore ahead of the IPL 2025 mega auction. However, his form has been disappointing for the team. In the three matches he has played so far, Rohit has managed just 21 runs at a dismal average of 7.00.The explosive left-handed opener Abhishek Sharma is known for his aggressive starts, often giving his team a flying start from the word go. However, that hasn’t been the case for the Sunrisers Hyderabad star this season. His bat has yet to catch fire, as he has managed just 31 runs in three matches at an average of 10.33. he was retained by Sunrisers Hyderabad for a whopping Rs 14 crore for IPL 2025.KKR all-rounder Venkatesh Iyer was the third most expensive player in the IPL 2025 Mega Auction. After playing a crucial role in KKR's title-winning IPL 2024 campaign—scoring 370 runs, including four half-centuries—the franchise bought him back for Rs 23.75 crore. However, Iyer has struggled this season, managing just 9 runs in three matches at a disappointing average of 4.50.The mention of Rinku Singh instantly brings back memories of his five breathtaking sixes in IPL 2023. Renowned for his game-changing batting, Rinku is struggling to find his rhythm this season, failing to connect the way he is known for. His poor form is a major concern for KKR, who are languishing at the bottom of the table with just one win in three matches. Retained for Rs 13 crore ahead of the IPL 2025 mega auction, Rinku has managed only 29 runs in as many games.The explosive young left-hander Yashasvi Jaiswal is known for providing a solid foundation with his aggressive stroke play. A dependable opener, he has struggled to find his rhythm this season. With scores of 1, 29, and 4 in three matches, Yashasvi has failed to make an impact in the Powerplay. Retained for Rs 18 crore ahead of the IPL 2025 mega auction, his form remains a concern for his team.Chennai Super Kings retained the legendary Mahendra Singh Dhoni for Rs 4 crore ahead of the IPL 2025 season, using the ""uncapped player"" rule, which permits teams to retain players who haven’t represented India internationally in the last five years. At 43, Dhoni remains a fan favourite, but his dip in form and struggles to finish games have raised concerns about his impact.

NEW DELHI: As Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) openers Sunil Narine and Quinton de Kock walked out to bat in their IPL 2025 match against Mumbai Indians (MI), fans anticipated a flurry of boundaries. Former England captain Eoin Morgan had earlier described the wicket at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium as a ""batter's paradise,"" further raising expectations.MI were winless in IPL 2025, having lost both their matches up to that point. However, what followed was a stunning display by the MI bowling attack, which dismantled KKR for just 116 runs in 16.2 overs. This dominant performance was spearheaded by debutant Ashwani Kumar , who made an immediate impact by dismissing KKR captain Ajinkya Rahane with his very first IPL delivery.Also See: LSG vs PBKS Live The left-arm pacer picked up four wickets in the match, becoming the first Indian ever to claim four dismissals on IPL debut.Interestingly, the 23-year-old had played only four senior T20 matches before facing KKR.While Ashwani has had a remarkable start to his IPL career, his journey to this stage has been anything but easy. The pacer hails from Jhanjeri, a small town near Chandigarh in Punjab.""Ashwani made his debut for Punjab in 2019. However, he was sidelined for three to four years due to multiple injuries. The intense competition for opportunities in the Punjab cricket team further limited his game time. Despite these setbacks, he never lost heart and kept working hard to make a mark as a cricketer,"" former Punjab cricketer Mandeep Singh said in an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com.""Ashwani comes from a very humble background, yet he regularly traveled to Mohali for practice. His determination was evident when he turned down a job opportunity in 2024 that would have provided financial stability but required him to leave Punjab. He told me, 'I am eager to fight on and play for Punjab. I don't want to give up.' His performances in Punjab’s domestic T20 league, Sher-E-Punjab, last year proved to be a turning point, as he impressed many with his death bowling and composure under pressure,"" added Mandeep, who played alongside Ashwani in Sher-E-Punjab.Former Team India batter and Punjab cricket team's head coach Wasim Jaffer praised Ashwani’s ability to seize opportunities.""Ashwani comes from a very humble background. He knows he has to perform whenever given a chance to fit into the Punjab team, considering the presence of players like Arshdeep Singh and Gurnoor Brar. He also understands that opportunities will be limited. I’ve told him, ‘You need to be prepared. As and when the opportunity comes, you need to strike.’ He has taken that advice seriously and works really hard. A lot of credit to him for making the most of his IPL debut,"" Jaffer said.""Ashwani can bowl at 140 kph, making him a potent bowler. He can generate quality movement and execute yorkers and bouncers astutely. Beyond that, he has an excellent attitude—he bowls tirelessly in the nets without ever complaining about workload or limited game time. He is eager to learn, and I hope he continues to perform well for MI,"" Jaffer added.While Ashwani was lethal against KKR, his bowling wasn’t always as effective.""I worked on Ashwani's action and helped remodel it because he struggled with line and length. The modifications have improved his accuracy and consistency, making him more effective. After the match against KKR, we spoke about the importance of staying focused rather than getting overwhelmed by success. He has faced numerous struggles—cricket is an expensive sport, and even affording good shoes can be challenging. But Ashwani has handled these hardships with great maturity,"" said his coach Varinder Singh.Ashwani finished with figures of 4/24 against KKR—an achievement he had seemingly manifested, as revealed by former SRH cricketer and Punjab all-rounder Sanvir Singh.""Before the tournament, we discussed how his IPL debut should play out. Ashwani said that picking three wickets while conceding under 30 runs would make it a dream debut. His dream and manifestation actually came true. MI head coach Mahela Jayawardene personally watched Ashwani bowl during the trials and decided to pick him in the player auction. I’m glad things are working out well for him,"" Sanvir said.",Ashwani Kumar becomes first Indian to take four wickets on IPL debut.

The Brazilians are monumentally hurt. Vinicius Junior has called for a seismic rethinking after returning from an embarrassing trip across the border. A 1-4 loss to Argentina, their bete noire, in the World Cup qualifier rang throughout the football cathedrals of the world, with stark images of the Mineirazo blinking on the stream of consciousness and social media.That had happened on the fateful June evening, the agony in Belo Horizonte, where Brazil suffered a humiliating 7-1 defeat to Germany on their own turf in the 2014 World Cup semifinal. Two unsuccessful World Cup campaigns followed, which took a toll on Tite, Ramon Menezes (caretaker), Fernando Diniz (caretaker). Last week, the sword, as expected, fell on Dorival Junior .Amid such changes, Brazil’s tendency to implode occasionally has been the excruciating constant. It is not the first time in the recent past that Brazil conceded four. Swamped with information that’s mostly unnecessary and used to obfuscate thought and reason, the world forgot that under Menezes in a June 2023 friendly, Sadio Mane’s Senegal pumped as many past Ederson, the Man City goalkeeper. Last week, however, the unfortunate gloveman was Bento.With 18 months to go for the World Cup, Brazil’s suffering against an Argentina that was without Lionel Messi, only strengthens the notion that the Canarinhos will qualify for the World Cup 2026, but nothing beyond. Thankfully with six out of 10 ten teams making it out of the South American group in this time’s inflated 48-team competition, Brazil and its fans don’t have to spend sleepless nights.The question that keeps popping up like unwelcome adverts, though, is, what ails Pele ’s team? Well, as the football romantic Simon Kuper says, “Brazil will always be Pele’s team.” For a while, it was also Ronaldo’s team. Post-Ronaldo, the history of Brazil is a history of struggle against Europe, non-transference of knowledge, and a story of brilliant individuals failing to play as a team.Their World Cup campaigns are a repeat-show of slipping on European banana peels. In 2006, it was Zidane’s France. Four years later in South Africa, it was Wesley Sneijder who rose above the yellow shirts. In their own backyard, Belo Horizonte, Brazil scripted their darkest chapter against Germany. Kevin de Bryune’s Belgium undid Neymar-powered Brazilians in Russia. In Qatar, Luka Modric’s Croatia cut short their run even though hardly any non-Croatian remembers Mislav Orsic the provider or Bruno Petkovic, the one who equalized.It marked Brazil’s fifth elimination in the World Cup against European opposition since a 2-0 victory over Germany in the 2002 final. No wonder Vinicius is left crying after the fresh debacle on the banks of River Plate.“Everyone did badly, we played badly, and Argentina played excellent,” Vinicius said, “We must rethink everything we’ve been doing, because the pressure will come, the people want us to win.“The World Cup is a year away and I’ve already played in a World Cup and I don’t want to lose again. I think we must do a lot of different things and take the good things we’re doing in qualifying to build a squad. Everyone knows how difficult it is to play in this kit, but we must keep our heads up. We’re going to qualify for the World Cup and try to do everything for our country,” he would add.Perhaps, the screams are a little too late in coming. Lest we forget, the country’s Olympic team, the stepping stone to the Selecao, failed to qualify for Paris 2024. Those who could recall another friendly against Spain under Dorival, the lingering image was how Lamine Yamal taught the visitors lessons in dribbling, a skill that was once the domain of the men in yellow.The words of Mario Zagallo, a World Cup winner as both a player and coach, turned out to be prophetic. He warned that the sellout of homegrown talent has led to the erosion of Brazil’s football identity. He was speaking right after Mineirazo; even a decade later — till his death this January — he wasn’t proven wrong.Leaving the shores early for Europe, is almost a Brazilian way of life. One can argue with some truth that they don’t make Pele, Garrincha, a Romario or Ronaldo anymore, just as they don’t make Shakespeare anymore.Raphinha is the key to Barcelona’s current degree of hotness. Players with lesser ability have come together to win football’s highest honour with organization, coaching acumen and a slice of luck. Marquinhos, for his life, will not be able to explain how Petkovic’s shot took that deflection to send Alisson the wrong way in Qatar. Neither could Tite.Dorival Junior is the third coach that the CBF has sacked after Tite resigned following the 2022 exit. Often quick changes in coaching staff are held responsible. Mario Zagallo was appointed just three months prior to the 1970 World Cup. And the team that rediscovered the ‘beautiful game” under Tele Santana in 1982, considered to be the best team not to have won the World Cup, had been under his charge for a full two years.In Brazil, it has always been the triumph of the individual over the collective. Unreasonable it may seem, as we are constantly feeding off European models. No one can explain Branco’s goal from a free-kick against Holland in 1994. Or Oliver Kahn’s spilling of Rivaldo’s stinger with Ronaldo sniffing around.In 2002, Brazil’s humungous qualification struggle had been buried into oblivion. Among four automatic slots, Brazil hadslipped in claiming the third! Reading Brazil, we instantly go back some 75 years when the world empathized with the struggle of the underprivileged. The intermediate changes in the society are overlooked as we lament Brazil’s reversals.Samindra Kunti, author of Brazil 1970, says, “The romantic idea of football is dead and we are forever expecting Brazil to rekindle the dream.”Maybe Brazil have wasted three years of preparation time or who knows, someone like Zagallo will appear to inspire and wipe away Vinicius’s tears.Marcela Mora y Araujo, who specialises in South American football, feels that the debacle against Argentina is just a blip and not a crisis.“Brazil’s qualification road has not always been smooth if we go by the history. They always have an ace up their sleeve.”",Brazil lost 1-4 to Argentina in a World Cup qualifier in Rio de Janeiro.

‘One defeat cannot define who Brazil are’

Chennai: With the World Cup little over a year away, Brazil find themselves in a not-so-ideal situation. The five-time champions, often expected to cruise through the qualifiers, are huffing and puffing on their way to the football extravaganza.The South American heavyweights are terribly low on morale after enduring their heaviest defeat in WC qualifying history, a 1-4 drubbing at the hands of bitter rivals and defending champions Argentina recently. Making matters worse, Brazil are without a head coach following the ouster of Dorival Jr and have gone back to square one.World Cup winners Dunga and Gilberto Silva , who know a thing or two about dazzling for Brazil on the global stage, remarked that the national federation should have finalised the manager for the World Cup a long time ago. “We have a lot of good coaches in Brazil, but here is the problem. We have one year to go for the WC and we are still looking for a coach. Postponing things might be the biggest problem. You start winning the World Cup off the field,” said Dunga, who is in Chennai for the Brazil Legends-India All Stars match and Football Plus summit.The seasoned Carlo Ancelotti, currently under contract at La Liga giants Real Madrid, has been heavily linked with the Brazil top job. “Sometimes, people take decisions based on emotions. This is not the solution. Sometimes, we have to be in this kind of situation, which is very disappointing. We are going to look for a manager one year before the start of the competition. This makes the work of the players even harder (tougher). I hope that whoever they (federation) decide, we start to play well again,” said Gilberto.Brazil have been let down by the indifferent international form of potential game-changers Vinicius Jr and Raphinha, players who have been delivering at club level.On why they are struggling to replicate their club form playing for the country, Gilberto said: “There is a massive difference between club and country. In a club, you are there every day, training with your colleagues and coach. In the national team, you may have the opportunity to spend time with your colleagues and manager about six times a year. It is not enough. In the short time, the players have to do as much as they can to maintain a high level.”The 2002 WC-winning member, who made the defensive midfielder’s position his own, added: “When you are in the national team of any country, there is massive pressure. When you are in Brazil, people do not understand how high the pressure is, how difficult it is to play under pressure. We, as supporters of the Brazil team, put pressure on everyone. We have been there, so we know the difficulties. We have to support them.”Dunga stressed that patience is key when trying to create a world-beating unit, something that Brazil have not managed to construct over the last 20 years. “We have to understand how hard it is to be a champion. We had a very strong group and it takes time to build that. It takes time to build champions and legends,” said Dunga, a 1994 WC winner.“Brazil struggled between 1970 and 1994, they did not win (the WC) for many years. Talent and technique are important, but only those are not enough to become a champion. It is important to have a ‘team’, which understands what discipline and sacrifice are. Sometimes, one shot is all that is there for us to win,” added Dunga, who also served as Brazil chief coach.Gilberto emphasised that the recent thrashing against Argentina cannot be considered the end of the world for Brazil. “It does not matter when we win a couple of games. When we lose one game, it is a big story. While preparing for the 2010 World Cup, we beat Argentina 3-1. From time to time, these kinds of situations happen. One defeat cannot define what we are at the moment. We should have in mind what we are capable of,” said Gilberto.","Brazil are without a head coach following the ouster of Dorival Jr. World Cup winners Dunga and Gilberto Silva say the national federation should have finalised the manager a long time ago.

Barcelona secured a commanding 4-1 victory over Girona at the Olympic Stadium on Sunday, with Robert Lewandowski scoring twice to help his team move three points clear at the top of La Liga. The win came after Real Madrid had temporarily drawn level on points following their victory against Leganes on Saturday.Barcelona extended their unbeaten run to 20 matches this year, with goals coming from a Ladislav Krejci own goal, Lewandowski's double, and Ferran Torres's strike. Girona's Arnaut Danjuma managed to score an equalizer during the match.Lewandowski, who remains three goals ahead in Spain's golden boot race against Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe, shared his thoughts on the victory: ""We played with patience, we had a plan and if we play with that plan we can always score a lot of goals and win the game.""The 36-year-old Polish striker expressed confidence about his future in the sport: ""I know a lot of people are talking about my age but... I want to play more years at the top level. I feel very good physically, I think looking at the stats there's no difference now to a few years ago.""Girona, currently sitting in 13th place, had previously beaten Barcelona twice last season but failed to replicate that form. Their coach Michel Sanchez acknowledged Barcelona's superiority: ""They were superior. There's a difference between the teams and that's the truth... Barcelona dream of titles every year.""Manager Hansi Flick rotated his squad with an upcoming Copa del Rey semi-final against Atletico Madrid in mind. The first half saw Barcelona dominating possession, with Lamine Yamal and Fermin Lopez providing attacking threats.A controversial moment arose when Barcelona appealed for a penalty after Fermin was brought down by Yaser Asprilla.

Sels heroics

Brighton, Mar 30, 2025 -Nottingham Forest reached the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 34 years as Belgian goalkeeper Matz Sels starred in a 4-3 penalty shoot-out win over Brighton on Saturday.After the quarter-final clash at the Amex Stadium finished 0-0 following extra-time, Sels took centre-stage to send Forest to Wembley.Sels saved spot-kicks from Jack Hinshelwood and Diego Gomez and, although Forest's Neco Williams blazed over, Ryan Yates held his nerve to stroke home the winner.Forest also needed shoot-outs to get past third-tier Exeter and top-flight strugglers Ipswich in the fourth and fifth rounds respectively this season.Nuno Espirito Santo 's side are enjoying a remarkable season that could culminate in Champions League qualification and a first FA Cup final appearance since 1991.""It was such a stressful moment. Matz saved us again. He's been doing really well. It's the third time and we've always been successful. Credit to him,"" Nuno said.""We are so happy. It's a huge moment for all of us to share with our fans.""We have to focus on the Premier League but it's going to be a beautiful moment for all of us on our journey.""Forest, who last won the FA Cup in 1959, have climbed to third in the Premier League, leaving them within touching distance of appearing in the Champions League for the first time since 1980-81.They are five points clear of fourth-placed Chelsea and six ahead of fifth-placed Manchester City with nine games to go.Brian Clough's men were the last Forest team to make the FA Cup semi-finals, beating West Ham before losing the final to Tottenham.Forest join Crystal Palace in the last four after the Eagles won 3-0 at Fulham in Saturday's other quarter-final.On Sunday, Manchester City travel to Bournemouth and Aston Villa visit Championship side Preston, the last club from outside the top tier in this season's tournament.Forest crushed Brighton 7-0 at the City Ground in Premier League in February, a result that ranked as the Seagulls' heaviest defeat for 67 years.Since that humbling loss, Brighton had won four times in a five-game unbeaten run in the league, but they were unable to stop Forest's penalty mastery.Nuno surprisingly dropped wingers Callum Hudson-Odoi and Anthony Elanga to the bench in a move that appeared to prioritise Tuesday's league clash with Manchester United.Forest were also without Chris Wood after their leading scorer suffered a hip injury on international duty with New Zealand.Wood's replacement Taiwo Awoniyi went close to an early opener, accelerating on to Ola Aina's pass for a stinging strike that Bart Verbruggen saved at his near post.But, shorn of their best attacking options, Forest struggled to make headway after that.Brighton were hardly much more incisive, with Pervis Estupinan's long-range blast pushed away by Sels.Carlos Baleba was inches away from putting the Seagulls ahead on the stroke of half-time, lashing just wide from the edge of the area.After their tepid start, Forest finally showed signs of life when Morgan Gibbs-White's strike from distance forced a superb save from Verbruggen.But Nuno had seen enough and sent on Hudson-Odoi and Elanga.Verbruggen repelled Elanga's close-range effort to force the tie into extra-time.Gomez nearly won it for Brighton in the closing stages, but his header from Brajan Gruda's cross was brilliantly saved by Sels, foreshadowing the keeper's heroics in the shoot-out.smg/dj",Nottingham Forest reach the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 34 years.

Football superstar and Argentina's World Cup-winning captain Lionel Messi was in attendance at the Hard Rock Stadium on Friday, where Novak Djokovic advanced to the Miami Open final with a commanding victory over 14th-seeded Grigor DimitrovIn pursuit of his 100th singles title, and seventh in Miami, Djokovic won 6-2, 6-3 and will face upstart Jakub Mensik, who upset Taylor Fritz 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4) in the other semfinial, for the title.During his post-match court interview, Djokovic recognised that Messi, who currently represents Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, was present, referring to him as ""King Leo.""Djokovic revealed that Messi, accompanied by his wife and children, visited the locker room where they exchanged presents. While Djokovic had previously attended Messi's matches, this marked the first occasion where the football star watched him play.""Obviously, it's a thrill to have his whole family,'' Djokovic said. ""It's a huge honour. He's such a great athlete, not just a football player. His impact on the world of sports in the last 20 years has been immense.""To have him watch me live brings me great joy and excitement and also a little pressure. It's definitely different when he brings his family. I was touched by that.""The 37-year-old Djokovic's performance hasn't been up to his lofty standards, beginning with a withdrawal due to injury at the Australian Open in January. At Indian Wells earlier this month, he suffered a first-round defeat against Botic van de Zandschulp.During the third game, play was halted when security personnel escorted a disruptive spectator from the venue. The chair umpire descended from his position and approached the stands while summoning security staff.Dimitrov engaged in a verbal exchange with the spectator and proceeded to direct the umpire's attention to the location of the troublesome fan at the sideline.""It's just heckling, it's fine,'' Dimitrov said. ""I'm a very calm guy overall. I don't pick any fights but don't trigger me.''Despite Dimitrov securing an early break against Djokovic in the opening game, the Serbian regained composure and secured the first set in 32 minutes.The current men's record holder of 24 Grand Slam titles displayed remarkable serving efficiency, landing 87% of first serves with merely six misses throughout the match. He maintained exceptional control, recording only five unforced errors during the 70-minute contest.""Now I know how it feels to be (John) Isner and (Reilly) Opelka,'' Djokovic said of two serving behemoths. ""Maybe my serve has been a bit underrated.""Djokovic extended his dominant head-to-head record against Dimitrov to 13-1. The Bulgarian player showcased his finest performance during the match.""He wears confidence like a stain on your shirt,'' Dimitrov said. ""It's beautiful to see. Only a few athletes on earth possess that quality.''Mensik, who entered the Miami Open as world number 54, has yet to reach a final in an ATP 1,000-point tournament.In a crucial moment against Fritz, he displayed remarkable composure at 4-4 in the final tiebreaker, securing victory by winning three consecutive points.Throughout the match lasting two hours and 25 minutes, Mensik failed to break serve but managed to win with a brilliant backhand winner down the line at 5-4. Fritz subsequently lost the next two points, sending a forehand long after a 20-shot exchange and netting a forehand on match point.Prior to the match, Mensik had a handshake with Messi. ""I didn't wash my hands before I stepped on the court,"" Mensik said.Tennis inspiration came to Mensik through Djokovic, whom he faced in a three-set match at the Shanghai Masters last October. The age difference between them stands at 18 years.","Novak Djokovic beats Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3 to reach Miami Open final.

She celebrated modestly and proceeded with her post-match responsibilities with professional poise.""I think I was so in the moment, and I made it a point to be in the moment every point that it's hard to realise what just happened. It's hard to realise that you won the match,"" she explained, when asked about her immediate emotions to beating the five-time grand slam winner.""I really tried to soak it all in, because this has never happened to me before, and that's why I was looking at the screen. You know, I really wanted to keep that moment in my mind.""Eala exhibited remarkable poise in the biggest match of her WTA Tour career, showcasing excellent preparation despite her limited experience.""I don't have a lot of experience on the WTA Tour, that's for sure, but I do have experience with compartmentalising. I have experience with being professional.""""I have no hesitation to bring that part of me out when I'm on court and when I'm in a setting that calls for professionalism.""Eala's professional journey began at age 13 when she left the Philippines to join Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca. She has spent six years immersed in tennis, training alongside top coaches and aspiring tour players.Her disciplined approach stems more from family influence than her academy training.""It's not something I learned in the academy. It's something I've gotten from, I guess, from my experience as the things I have been through leading up to this moment. It's also something my family has guided me through, it's part of my family's values.""""They are successful people in business, they are successful in their own fields and people I look up to. I think they lead by example when it comes to that.""The match drew special supporters to her box. Her parents traveled from the Philippines, accompanied by an uncle and cousin from Seattle. Toni Nadal , Rafael's uncle and former coach, represented the academy.""So a lot of extra motivation for my match today. I really wanted to have my family see me winning, but I know they'd be happy just to see me compete in this setting.""""And Toni also came in to Miami. That did mean a lot, because I have been working closely with him for so long, alongside my main coaches from the academy, it showed a lot about the confidence and the pride the academy has in me.""Eala recalled a previous photograph with Swiatek at an academy graduation event two years ago. She expressed hope that her victory would inspire young people in the Philippines to pursue tennis.The 19-year-old from Quezon City joins a list of teenagers who have made dramatic entrances into WTA elite competition.

Miami Gardens: Alexandra Eala , a 19-year-old wildcard from the Philippines, produced a huge upset at the Miami Open on Wednesday, defeating world number two Iga Swiatek 6-2 7-5 to reach the semi-finals.Ranked 140th in the world, Eala, the first woman from her country to reach the last eight of a WTA 1000 tournament, took advantage of a unusually poor display from Swiatek, keeping her focus as she fought back from 4-2 down in the second set.Eala broke the Pole for the eighth and final time when Swiatek was serving to stay in the match at 6-5 down in the second set and looked stunned as she struggled to contain her emotions.""I'm just in disbelief right now. It's so surreal,"" she said on court.""I'm so happy and so blessed to be able to compete with such a player on this stage,"" said Eala, who has now beaten three grand slam winners on her route to the last four at Miami -- having dealt with Jelena Ostapenko and Madison Keys before upsetting four-time French Open champion Swiatek.""I'm trusting my shots and I have a great team to tell me that I can do it,"" she said.Eala moved to Spain at the age of 13 to join Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca and Toni Nadal, the Spaniard's uncle and former coach, was in her box for the match.""It meant a lot that he showed up here. It showed the confidence he had in me and the confidence the academy had in me,"" she said.Eala will face Jessica Pegula , who beat Britain's Emma Raducanu in the other quarter-final. The American came through 6-4, 6-7, 6-2.""Just because I won this match or the one before doesn't make the next one any less tough. If anything it will be more tough, so it will take everything that I have,"" said Eala.Swiatek will look forward to moving on to the clay season after conceding that she had been far from her usual level.""I'm sure I wasn't playing my best game and I felt like my forehand collapsed a little, so it wasn't comfortable and Alexandra, for sure, used her chances and pushed me, so for sure she deserves to win this match,"" she said.""I don't want to think about this too long. It's nice to learn from losses but there are other things ahead and I am happy we are going to play on clay.""",Wildcard Alexandra Eala beats world number two Iga Swiatek 6-2 7-5 in Miami.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka fought back in the second set to secure her spot in the semi-finals of the Miami Open , defeating China's Zheng Qinwen 6-2, 7-5 on Tuesday.This win marks Sabalenka’s first appearance in the semi-finals in Miami, where she’ll meet Italy's Jasmine Paolini for a chance to reach the final.It seemed like a straightforward match for the Belarusian against the ninth seed Zheng as she easily took the first set. However, Zheng made adjustments and came out strong in the second set, breaking Sabalenka twice to establish a 4-2 lead.Sabalenka faced significant pressure at 0-40 but, after showing some frustration, rallied to hold serve and tie it at 4-4. She then unleashed a powerful finish, breaking Zheng again to lead 6-5 and serving confidently to clinch the match.""Honestly every match is tough against her, I always have to work really hard to get the win and today was an incredible level from both of us,"" said Sabalenka.""I'm super happy to get this win.

Paolini sinks Osaka

Australia's Alex de Minaur put an end to Brazilian talent Joao Fonseca 's challenge at the Miami Open, outlasting the 18-year-old 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in an enthralling contest.Attendance on stadium court had been sparse throughout Monday, but the Hard Rock Stadium turned into a mini-Maracana Stadium for Fonseca's match, complete with Brazilian flags and football-style chanting.Fonseca brought his energetic brand of ultra-attacking tennis, but De Minaur was up to the challenge, coping with both the blistering forehands and the partisan crowd.Such was the dominance of Fonseca's raucous support that the referee switched to Portuguese for his appeals for quiet.But de Minaur won six of the final seven games to move into the fourth round, keeping his cool even when the crowd, at times, disrupted his serve preparation.""Mentally I was ready for this match, I knew I was not only going to play an incredible talent like Joao, playing with immense confidence and nothing to lose, but also an incredible crowd that was on his side from the first point until the last,"" de Minaur said.""One of my biggest strengths is my mentality and that is what got me the win today,"" he added.Top seed Alexander Zverev recovered from a slow start to power into the fourth round of the Miami Open with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Australia's Jordan Thompson.The German was 4-1 down in the first set but then went on a roll, winning eight of the next nine games to progress.Zverev lost in the opening round at Indian Wells, but with Carlos Alcaraz already out in Miami he will fancy his chances of adding to his list of seven Masters 1000 titles.Third-seed Taylor Fritz also moved into the fourth round beating Denis Shapovalov of Canada 7-5, 6-3.The American let slip a 5-2 lead in the first set, but regained control with his serve proving too much for Shapovalov.In the women's draw, third-seed Coco Gauff 's bid ended with a 6-4 6-4 loss to Poland's Magda Linette .Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka eased her way into the last eight with a 6-4, 6-4 win over last year's winner Danielle Collins of the USA.Next, Sabalenka will be up against ninth seeded Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen who reached her second consecutive WTA 1000 quarter-final, with a straight-sets win over Ashlyn Krueger.""I'm super happy to get this win in straight sets and happy with the level I played today,"" said Sabalenka.""She's a tough opponent, and we had a lot of tough and tricky matches in the past. So was very happy to get through this one,"" she added.Italy's Jasmine Paolini enjoyed a 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 comeback win over Naomi Osaka in 2 hours and 15 minutes.Since her comeback from maternity leave 15 months ago, Osaka has been showing some signs of getting back towards her best but Paolini was the first top 10 player Osaka has faced this year.""I don't think that I can say that I've played a lot of matches against top players like this in a while,"" said Osaka.""The way she plays kind of catches me off guard, simply because of her height. I didn't know she could hit like that,"" she added.Emma Raducanu continued her impressive form in Miami, cruising to a 6-1, 6-3 victory in 69 minutes over American Amanda Anisimova, who had eliminated Indian Wells winner Mirra Andreeva on Sunday.It is the first time Raducanu has won four straight WTA Tour main draw matches in a row since her US Open triumph in 2021. She will face American Jessica Pegula next.Raducanu, who has brought in some old faces from the early days of her career for this tournament, said she was benefitting from their presence.""I'm really happy with how things are on and off the court right now and just so happy that's able to transfer on to the match court,"" she said.Alexandra Eala, the 19-year-old from the Philippines who upset Australian Open champion Madison Keys on Sunday, was handed a place in the quarter-finals after her fourth round opponent, Spain's Paula Badosa, pulled out with a lower back injury.In the last eight Eala will face second seed Iga Swiatek who battled past Ukraine's Elina Svitolina 7-6 (7/5) 6-3.","Alex de Minaur beats Joao Fonseca 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in enthralling contest.

Alexandra Eala , a 19-year-old tennis player from the Philippines, achieved a historic victory at the Miami Open on Sunday by defeating Australian Open champion Madison Keys .This win marked a significant milestone as Eala became the first Filipino woman to defeat a top-10 ranked player since the ranking system's inception 50 years ago.The emotional victory saw Eala celebrating with her team, embracing them while fighting back tears.""It's a big thing to take in, and I feel it's important for me to take it in step by step. I'm so super proud of what I was able to accomplish, but it definitely fuels me more.""""I know and it's in my mind that I have a next match, but I need to stop, and I need to recognise that what I did today was really amazing. I think my reaction on court, you know, sums up pretty much how I feel about it.""At the age of 13, Eala's family made the decision to send her to Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca, Spain, recognizing her evident talent.The academy's exceptional coaching and facilities helped shape Eala into the 2022 US Open girls' singles champion and a competitive player on the WTA Tour .""The academy has been my home for the past seven years. Of course, my family should take credit for the foundation that they laid out before they sent me there.""""But of course, the academy was able to build on that foundation in such a way that I'm able to be where I am now. And I think the combination of everything that I've been through since I started tennis is what has led to this moment and what has led to me having all these opportunities.""The decision to move to Europe was made easier as her brother Miko also joined the academy.""It was definitely a big decision for me, for us. As soon as I heard that, I jumped at the opportunity because I knew that I had to get out of the country eventually to improve.""Eala's tennis journey began with her grandfather, a club player who coached her brother and cousins before focusing on her development.""I was kind of the next in line to do that and to spend time with him. It eventually blossomed into the career I have now.""Her victory came shortly after fellow Nadal Academy member Coleman Wong from Hong Kong defeated American 13th seed Ben Shelton in Miami.""I'm super happy for him and to see someone that I've known so long do so well is definitely an inspiration. Not just to me, but I feel in general a lot of people can take inspiration from him.""Despite her success, Eala maintains a humble perspective about being a role model for young players in the Philippines.""The young kids, the youth in the Philippines, they don't need to take inspiration from me. They can take inspiration from anyone they want. You know, they can take inspiration from other things, which is what I did growing up.""","Alexandra Eala became the first Filipino woman to defeat a top-10 ranked player since the ranking system's inception 50 years ago.

CHENNAI: Sankar Muthusamy recorded the biggest win of his nascent career yet, defeating World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12, 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.What surprised many was the way in which the Indian dominated the deciding game. Despite losing the opener, the 21-year-old did not give up and pushed the match to the decider. He was helped by a flurry of unforced errors that Antonsen committed — the Dane hitting the shuttle wide and long on multiple occasions. Sankar made the most of the opportunity and succeeded.The Chennai lad entered the tournament as a qualifier and registered two wins to enter the main draw.“It feels good, and I have been doing well in this tournament. The first game (against Antonsen) lasted for close to 30 minutes and I feel that he became tired after that. I was able to score points from long rallies and capitalised on the situation. I was focusing on one point at a time and did not think much about the result,” Sankar, ranked 64th, told TOI from Basel.“In the deciding game, I was just expecting him to come back at me and was ready to handle the situation. My aim was to move him around the court and make him tired.”Sankar, who was a former junior World No. 1, lacked consistency in the 2024 season due to various reasons. However, he started the 2025 season on a bright note, reaching the quarterfinals of the Thailand Masters. He was later down with fever and could not give his best in the next few tournaments. However, Sankar recovered well ahead of the Swiss Open.The youngster, who is known for his defensive play, has improved his attacking skills and stroke-making.“My strokes have become sharper than usual, and I am able to finish off points from the rear court. My power is gradually increasing, and I am working on it. There is still a long way to go,” he said.Sankar’s long-time coach Aravindan Samiappan said that the win has come at the right time for his ward.“The moment has not sunk in properly. Sankar was an underdog and had nothing to lose. Our plan was to stay neck-to-neck on points and towards the end anything could have happened. But none would have expected such a scoreline in the decider. It was a bit shocking but that happens sometimes,” Aravindan said.The coach feels that opponents can no longer come prepared for Sankar, as he lends unpredictability into his game now.“Sankar can vary the pace of the match whenever required, and this was not the case one and a half years ago. Players could anticipate what he was going to do, as he played at a single pace. Now, you cannot predict him, and that is the major difference in his gameplay,” pointed out the coach.","Sankar Muthusamy defeated World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12,. 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.

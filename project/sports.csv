Haider Ali

NEW DELHI: Haider Ali has played just three T20 Internationals, but the 30-year-old left-arm spinner from Lahore has become the heartbeat of UAE cricket after helping his adopted nation script a historic series win over Bangladesh on May 21 in Sharjah — UAE’s first ever T20I series victory against a Test-playing nation.In an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com, a visibly emotional Haider reflected on what the milestone meant to him and dedicated his performances to the people who helped shape his journey — his family, his late father and his cricketing mentors.""I was crying when we won the series. These successes are for my family, for my village and especially for my late father who passed away last year. I haven't met him since I came to Dubai four years ago,"" Haider said. ""We have struggled together. So, these successes are for all those well-wishers.""Haider, who returned sensational figures of 3 for 7 in the series decider, turned the match on its head in two Powerplay overs (2-1-2-3) that wrecked the Bangladesh top order. Earlier, in the second T20I, he held his nerve with the bat, scoring an unbeaten 15 off six balls and hitting the winning run in a dramatic 206-run chase.""This is a proud moment, not just for me, but for everyone involved — the support staff, team management and Emirates Cricket Board.It feels great to perform for your team against a Test nation. Such performances stay in the memory forever,"" he beamed.While Haider is just starting his international journey, he believes the foundation for UAE’s recent rise was laid in the ILT20 league and under the watchful eye of head coach Lalchand Rajput ""ILT20 gave me everything,"" Haider admitted. ""I was the best bowler in ILT20’s development tournament, then became the 'Emerging Player' in the first season. I bowled well last season too, and from there, got selected for the national team. It’s a massive platform — not only for local players but internationals too. Look at Jake Fraser-McGruk from Australia — he came, performed, and got a national call-up. In the next 2-3 years, ILT20 has the calibre to match PSL or other top leagues. ""Haider’s admiration for coach Lalchand Rajput is equally deep-rooted. ""He’s played at the highest level for India, and his coaching experience is vast. Since he joined, the environment has been so positive. He never makes us feel like he’s the coach — it’s like a family. He backs fighters — players who don’t give up. I’m learning a lot from him and hope to absorb more in the future.""Haider’s work ethic has also played a big role in his rapid ascent. Aware of the dew factor in UAE’s night matches, he adapted in unique ways. ""I fill a bucket with water, soak 30-40 balls in it and bowl with them during practice. So when the actual match happens, I feel no difference. I bowl 20-30 overs a day — because to beat a Test-playing nation, you have to go the extra mile.""He added, ""My goal is clear — I’ve reached this level now and I never want to drop below. I want to leave UAE cricket better than I found it. I plan and train keeping that vision in mind.""His passion for batting also surfaced during the second T20I when UAE needed 29 off the final two overs. ""I love batting. All bowlers do!"" he laughed. ""I told myself, ‘Haider, today is the day you show the world what you can do,’ and thankfully, I delivered.""Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Haider also heaped praise on the Emirates Cricket Board. ""The board is working tirelessly for the players — they’re giving us support, facilities and direction. My aim now is to help UAE qualify for the next T20 World Cup and take this team to even greater heights.""With tears of joy still fresh from UAE’s series win and ILT20 triumph with Dubai Capitals, Haider’s story is not just one of sporting success but of deep personal meaning.""I think the people in my village were happier than I was,"" he smiled. ""They’ve supported me so much, and this is for them. For my well-wishers, my family, and most of all — for my father. This is just the beginning.""",Haider Ali has played just three T20 Internationals. The left-arm spinner from Lahore has become the heartbeat of UAE cricket.

More Than a Team: The Rise of CSK & the Whistle Podu Army

Chelsea were once one of Europe's most well-run clubs under their former owner Roman Abramovich, with a focus on shrewd transfer dealings and value creation. There was specific emphasis on signing proven campaigners, which paid off handsomely, with the Blues winning two Champions League titles as well as five Premier League trophies. However, Abramovich was forced to sell the club to a consortium led by American billionaire Todd Boehly, turning things upside down. Financial wisdom went out the window, with players purchased at immensely extravagant sums. A recent UEFA report stated that Chelsea spent almost two billion euros in transfer fees from 2020 to 2024, terming the club's 2024 squad as ""the most expensive ever assembled.""Close to 39 transfers have been completed in just two years, resulting in fans and experts terming the decision-making ""madness."" Boehly's stint drew controversy early on following the decision to sack the club's 2021 Champions League-winning manager Thomas Tuchel. The billionaire picked ex-Brighton manager Graham Potter as a replacement, which failed miserably, as Chelsea finished 12th in the 2022/23 season after a third-place finish. Former Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino also failed to transform fortunes, leading to yet another managerial vacancy.While pundits expected Boehly to re-appoint Tuchel, the billionaire took an unprecedented decision by handing over charge to ex-Leicester City manager Enzo Maresca at the start of the 2024/25 season. The decision seemed quite brazen, considering Maresca had no formal Premier League experience as a manager. While the transfer merry-go-round continued under Maresca, with 11 new players signed including Jadon Sancho, the Italian manager developed a robust system around young and hungry players.Maresca faced a tough start to his stint, as the Blues conceded easy goals in friendlies and suffered a loss in their opening PL match against Manchester City. However, the Italian took a leaf out of his former boss Pep Guardiola's playbook by retaining self-belief amid pressure. Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez, Cole Palmer, and Levi Colwill formed the core of the setup, with Maresca placing trust in Nicolas Jackson despite the striker's inexperience. There was also heavy focus on versatility to catch the opposition unawares, with full-backs Marc Cucurella and Malo Gusto inverting into midfield.""Maresca picked the two best players for every position with emphasis on versatile players like Gusto who can play either as a right-back or a central midfielder,"" said Spanish football manager Mario Rivera.Chelsea dominated proceedings in the season's first half with fast, fluid, and explosive football, smashing goals for fun. While Palmer had already developed a reputation as a game-changer, emerging players like Noni Madueke also made their presence felt, as evident from the latter's 14-minute hat-trick against Wolves.""The main tactical change in the Chelsea setup is the numeric superiority in the central channel. While attacking, they operate in a 3-2-2-3 formation with four midfielders, offering greater control. The high-press system gives Chelsea a chance to play far off the goalpost with much more balance for transitions,"" stated Rivera.Chelsea were well in contention for the league title until December after jumping to the second spot, resulting in fans chanting, ""We have our Chelsea back."" However, injuries to crucial players like defender Wesley Fofana and Jackson, as well as Mykhailo Mudryk's long-term suspension, impacted results over a crucial two-month period, pushing Maresca into a spot of bother. While experts stated that opponents had figured out the Italian's gameplay, there were also question marks over the system's intensity, resulting in fatigue.Three wins in 12 matches between December 22 and February 22 pushed Chelsea to sixth place, resulting in heavy criticism over the quality of recruitment. However, Maresca's 'band of brothers' kept marching on, with Champions League qualification coming down to their final Premier League match against Nottingham Forest — who had been brilliant themselves. Colwill stepped up in this crucial encounter, vindicating the Italian manager's faith by scoring the winner.Maresca's brilliance enabled Chelsea to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since Boehly's takeover, recording the feat with the youngest average line-up in Premier League history — 24 years and 36 days. ""The doubt was from outside. Critics were saying that we were not able to win because we are too young and inexperienced. F**k off to all of them,"" said the Italian manager in a no-holds-barred retort after a league season which has revived Chelsea's flagging fortunes.","Chelsea were once one of Europe's most well-run clubs, with a focus on shrewd transfer dealings and value creation. Under American billionaire Todd Boehly, the club spent almost two billion euros in transfer fees from 2020 to 2024.

RCB will now face Punjab Kings at Mullanpur on Thursday.RCB finished second on the points table with 19 points, level with Punjab Kings but behind on net run rate (+0.30 compared to PBKS’s +0.37).Chasing a challenging target of 228, RCB started aggressively. Openers Virat Kohli (54 off 30 balls, 10 fours) and Phil Salt (30 off 19 balls) put on 61 runs in just 5.4 overs. Jitesh Sharma and Mayank Agarwal then combined for an impressive unbeaten 107-run partnership for the fifth wicket, guiding the team home with eight balls to spare, finishing at 230/4 in 18.4 overs.Kohli and Salt played smartly during the Powerplay, hitting 12 fours before Salt was dismissed by pacer Akash Khan. Kohli continued his fluent innings with elegant boundaries, including a back-foot punch off Akash Khan that took him past fifty in just 27 balls. However, he couldn’t convert his fifty into a bigger score and fell trying to bunt pacer Avesh Khan, caught by Ayush Badoni.RCB were 123 for four at 11.4 overs, having lost skipper Rajat Patidar and Liam Livingstone early, but Jitesh and Agarwal dominated the latter stages of the chase.Jitesh was lucky to survive a back-foot no-ball when on 49, and Pant withdrew a run-out appeal when he was on 57. The duo expertly targeted gaps with sweeps, cuts, and controlled aggression.Jitesh sealed the win by smashing three sixes off Will O’Rourke in the 18th over.Earlier, LSG posted a formidable 227 for three, powered by captain Rishabh Pant ’s brilliant 118 not out off 61 balls (11 fours, 8 sixes) and Mitchell Marsh’s quickfire 67 off 37 balls. Pant reached his century in just 54 balls, rewriting his season after earlier struggles with form and strike rate.Pant’s innings was anchored by a 152-run second-wicket stand with Marsh. Despite Marsh’s dismissal, Pant carried on with his aggressive, yet controlled, batting, celebrating his hundred with an acrobatic somersault. Later, he added 49 more runs with Nicholas Pooran to boost LSG’s total.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) beat Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) RCB will now face Punjab Kings at Mullanpur on Thursday.

Poll Should RCB focus on their batting lineup for the playoffs? Yes, absolutely! No, their bowling is more critical

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli etched his name in the record books once again, notching up his 63rd IPL fifty during the 2025 clash against Lucknow Super Giants. With this knock, he overtook David Warner to become the player with the most half-centuries in IPL history, while his wife Anushka Sharma proudly cheered him on from the stands.Earlier, LSG put on a batting masterclass in the first innings, amassing a mammoth total of 227 runs. Skipper Rishabh Pant led the charge with a scintillating unbeaten 118 off 61 balls, laced with 11 fours and 8 sixes.Chasing a daunting target, RCB’s reply started on a strong note, thanks to a 61-run opening stand between Kohli and Phil Salt. Though Salt departed during the powerplay, Kohli kept up the momentum. He reached his fifty in the 10th over, also becoming the first batter to record 63 IPL half-centuries and crossing the 9000-run mark for RCB in T20s (including IPL and CLT20).Anushka Sharma was visibly delighted in the stands, applauding her husband’s achievement with a glowing smile and claps.However, RCB's innings began to unravel after Kohli fell to Avesh Khan in the 12th over.Anushka's disappointed reaction was quickly caught on camera moments after Kohli’s dismissal. Rajat Patidar and Liam Livingstone also departed cheaply, handing their wickets to William O’Rourke.With the match hanging in the balance, the onus shifted to Jitesh Sharma, Mayank Agarwal, and Romario Shepherd to guide Bengaluru home.Interestingly, RCB have already secured a spot in the playoffs, whereas LSG are out of contention. Still, a win in this match could give Bengaluru a shot at finishing in the top two.","Virat Kohli scores his 63rd IPL fifty against Lucknow Super Giants.

Chhetri’s return bad news for Indian football: Venkatesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/chhetris-return-bad-news-for-indian-football-venkatesh/articleshow/121448497.cms,"Venkatesh Shanmugam

CHENNAI: Back in 2005, as the India captain, Venkatesh Shanmugam had urged a fading senior to step aside so that an eager 20-year-old Sunil Chhetri could get his chance. It was a bold call then. And now, with Chhetri stepping back onto the international stage after ‘retirement’, Venkatesh voices a deep-seated disappointment. The man who once cleared the path for Chhetri is left wondering why Indian football isn’t doing the same for those waiting in the wings.“Two decades ago, I told a senior player to hang up his boots so a young Sunil Chhetri could rise,” Venkatesh, who is currently the technical director at FC Madras, told TOI. “But now, Chhetri breaking his retirement to come back is bad news for Indian football. It’s demotivating for all the young players. I’m not blaming Chhetri. He will play only one or two matches. But if you bring a youngster and back him now, he will give 10 years.“Indirectly, we are sending a message to everyone that we don’t have players. We are seeing that a lot of grassroots programme have come and there are a lot of tournaments. Still, we are depending on the 40-year-old striker?”Venkatesh, a former assistant coach of the India senior team, didn’t mince words on the chaos surrounding head coach Manolo Marquez, who had a dual role while coaching FC Goa and the national team.“We are going 20 years back,” the star midfield of his time bluntly said. “We have done this before. We failed when Armando Colaco was coach for both Dempo and the national team (in 2011). We have to bring a permanent coach. I respect all the coaches, including Manolo. But which coach will think about Indian football and take risks for it? That’s a big question.”Venkatesh, who holds an AFC Pro Licence, explained the differences between coaching a club and steering a national team and how each demands a separate mindset and level of commitment.“Thanks to the ISL (Indian Super League), they brought a lot of attention to football in India. But when you play in the ISL, the Indian players will play only against four foreigners. When we go for international games, you have to face eleven foreigners. The temperament is completely different. You can’t compare ISL and international football. Tomorrow, if you play against a team like Korea, you need solid preparation. It’s true Manolo has done well as an ISL coach and that’s why AIFF thought he knew Indian football well. But international football is something different,” said Venkatesh.So, what’s the way forward? For Venkatesh, it starts with looking beyond the obvious. “I feel this is high time that Indian football bosses think seriously about building a second layer. There has to be a Team ‘A’ and a Team ‘B’. Fill Team B with young players, give them time and space to grow. The only thing that separates a star from the rest is opportunity. And when there’s pressure for places in the first team, it naturally brings out the best in players,” the 46-year-old said.Venkatesh is optimistic about the current bunch of Indian players. “I can see that the current Indian players, in terms of technique and physicality, are very strong. If you see all the players, all the positions, you can see aggression. Indian football is more aggressive now,” said Venkatesh.Venkatesh also pointed out that there is a lack of a proper bridge between youth and senior levels. “I feel we should concentrate more on the under-21 category, then only you will get a strong core for the future. There’s a big gap post the under-19 level. Players are jumping straight into the senior team without proper progression. The under-21 level is the backbone of Indian football,” he said.",Venkatesh Shanmugam says Indian football needs to build a second layer. The former India captain is disappointed by the decision of Sunil Chhetri to return to the national team. He also believes there is a lack of a proper bridge between youth and senior levels.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121448443,imgsize-802088,width-400,resizemode-4/121448443.jpg"

Stoffel Vandoorne shares their strategy for Tokyo race

It cannot be just a coincidence that Maserati MSG Racing driver Stoffel Vandoorne started from the 14th position on the grid and went on to win the Tokyo E-Prix Round 8. He even managed to beat Nissan’s Oliver Rowland, who had started from pole. Vandoorne shined while others struggled with poor visibility, a slippery track, and grip issues as it rained cats and dogs during the Tokyo race. Not only that, he also recovered from a spin on the wet track to cross the finish line first. The Tokyo winner says it’s all because of how their plan fell in place to perfection.Stoffel Vandoorne revealed that their winning strategy involved a calculated risk of taking the Pit Boost early in the race, which could have worked in their favor if there had been a race stoppage, allowing them to save time during the gap.""It was not an easy race, but a lot of opportunities with the rain and the management. We kind of gamble a little bit with our strategy but it was also calculated at the same time. The plan perfectly played in our hands, and the chances of this happening in Formula E are very, very slim,” Vandoorne told Formula E in an interview.""It was difficult because I had to manage so many things. I was on the radio with my engineer in between laps and he was giving me advice on the gap that I had to Oliver (Rowland) to make sure I was safe enough with my energy.I was struggling, and I was down to 10% at some point and I had to bring the car home so there was a lot of management to do,"" he added.Vandoorne moved to Maserati MSG Racing last season and is in love with his new team. Talking about the same, he said, ""I’m just happy for the team, for myself, it’s been a little while. They are such a good group of people, some familiar faces from the past as well, their vibe is super cool, their base is Monaco and that is my home as well. They are making my life easy.""Also Read: Tokyo E-Prix Round 8 results: Stoffel Vandoorne clinches long-awaited win in wet conditions; Oliver Rowland finishes second Stoffel Vandoorne’s much-awaited win came three years after his last victory in Monaco in 2022.

Oliver Rowland talks about his win at Tokyo E-Prix



Oliver Rowland is currently far ahead of his fellow Formula E drivers when it comes to on-track competition. Not only is he leading the Formula E Driver Standings, but he has also won four of the nine races in the current season. Rowland has now said it all feels like a dream—and at times, he even feels the need to wake up from it. He also spoke about getting emotional after seeing his daughter following his fourth win of the season at the Tokyo E-Prix Round 9.It was a heartwarming sight to watch Oliver Rowland stand on the podium in Tokyo with his daughter Harper. Reflecting on the moment, the Nissan driver told Formulae.com, ""I was already tired after qualifying. I was feeling pretty stressed with everything. There was a lot of pressure to go through. I was looking forward to the race being over, to be honest, and when it was over... when I saw her face I just couldn't help but be super emotional.""[The atmosphere] was amazing. I didn't realise how many people were here until I stood on the podium, so it was a really special moment for me and the team. Honestly, sometimes I feel like I need to wake up from the dream that I'm living at the moment,"" he added.After finishing second in the Round 8 race the day before, Rowland lifted the winner’s trophy in Round 9 on Sunday—despite starting from sixth on the grid. He admitted to doing a “poor job” in the first half of the race, which saw TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein finishing in second place.Speaking about beating Wehrlein to take the victory, Rowland revealed, ""Pascal was pushing pretty hard in the 350[kw], so to follow him was quite difficult. I knew I was just going to get one chance, and I had to make it count. I think there was about a car's-width gap, and it closed as I was in it! I think I was touching the wall and him at some point. He was hard, but I like racing like this. People complain about it: sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, and I think it was just an excellent bit of racing, to be honest.

Unreal. I deserve a diploma for beating Medvedev after losing to him four times,"" Norrie said after his victory.The match between Norrie and Medvedev saw multiple momentum shifts throughout its duration.

""He beat a lot of great opponents - (Daniil) Medvedev at the Australian Open and me in Acapulco,"" Zverev recalled.""He is going climb up the rankings.

'I don't want to be a one-season wonder': Punjab Kings' Shashank Singh





A day after a one-sided affair in Qualifier 1, the Eliminator between Gujarat Titans (GT) and Mumbai Indians (MI) proved to be exactly what the doctor ordered at the New PCA Stadium in Mullanpur. It went down to the wire as MI defeated GT by 20 runs. MI will now take on Punjab Kings in Qualifier 2 on Sunday at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Gujarat.Rohit Sharma (81 off 50 balls; 9x4, 4x6) made the most of two reprieves offered by GT fielders as the five-time champions delivered a strong statement in the must-win match. After winning the toss, MI posted a formidable 228 for 5.Rohit was dropped twice—first by Gerald Coetzee and then by Kusal Mendis—and he made GT pay for those missed chances. In the second over, Prasidh Krishna banged one in short, and Rohit miscued a pull high into the air. Coetzee had enough time, kept his eyes on the ball, but shelled the skier. Rohit was on 4 at the time, looking to break free with a swivel pull.In the next over, Rohit dispatched two delightful boundaries off Mohammed Siraj. Siraj could’ve had the last laugh, but Mendis fumbled a thick edge behind the stumps—failing to grab it in two attempts.The fourth over completely turned the tide in MI’s favour, as Jonny Bairstow hammered 26 runs off Prasidh Krishna’s second over—featuring three sixes, including a monster hit into the second tier at Mullanpur.Making his first appearance of the season, Bairstow came out firing on all cylinders. He and Rohit forged a rollicking 84-run opening partnership, with 79 of those runs coming in the powerplay. Bairstow blazed his way to a 22-ball 47 before falling to Sai Kishore.The powerplay onslaught set the tone, and the rest of the MI batting unit kept the momentum going. Suryakumar Yadav (33 off 20 balls; 1x4, 3x6) and Tilak Varma (25 off 11; 3x6) chipped in with impactful cameos. Captain Hardik Pandya (22* off 9; 3x6) provided the finishing touches, smashing Coetzee for 22 runs in the final over.Prasidh Krishna (2/53) and Sai Kishore (2/42) took two wickets each, but most of GT’s bowlers proved expensive. However, Team India management and Test captain Shubman Gill may be concerned after Mohammed Siraj, who dismissed Tilak Varma in the 18th over, appeared to pull his hamstring later in the same over.Sai Sudharsan continues to redefine orthodoxy in T20 cricket. His classical technique offers a refreshing counter to the notion that T20 cricket is eroding traditional skills. In this IPL season, Sudharsan has shown that the two formats—Test and T20—can indeed coexist. While broadcasters may try to strip away the “cricket” from T20, players like Sudharsan keep putting it right back in.On Friday, the 23-year-old produced yet another masterclass. He scored a classy 80 off 49 balls, laced with 10 boundaries and a six. Despite his aggressive approach, Sudharsan rarely loses shape, showcasing a full range of proper cricketing shots.GT’s chase began on a poor note, with Trent Boult removing skipper Shubman Gill for just 1. But Sudharsan continued in red-hot form, hitting a six off Boult and finding support in Kusal Mendis, who launched two sixes in the same over. The duo kept the momentum going, especially as Sudharsan struck two boundaries off Richard Gleeson’s first over.Hardik Pandya brought himself on but was welcomed with two boundaries from Sudharsan and one from Mendis, who narrowly escaped a run-out at the end of the powerplay. However, Mendis was soon out in bizarre fashion—hit wicket after stepping on the stumps and falling flat on his back.Sudharsan found another able partner in Washington Sundar (48 off 24), and together they stitched an 84-run stand off just 46 balls. At that point, GT looked well on course to make Qualifier 2. But Jasprit Bumrah, the ultimate T20 cheat code, yorked Sundar to break the stand.Shortly after, Gleeson dismissed Sudharsan, effectively ending GT’s hopes. Lower-order efforts from Sherfane Rutherford (24), Rahul Tewatia (16), and Shahrukh Khan (16) weren’t enough, as MI held their nerves and marched on to the next round.",Mumbai Indians defeated Gujarat Titans by 20 runs in IPL Qualifier 2. Rohit Sharma (81) and Jonny Bairstow (47) scored centuries for MI.

Why no Shreyas Iyer for England tour? Coach Gautam Gambhir opens up





NEW DELHI: Karun Nair oozed elegance with a sublime unbeaten 186, issuing a timely reminder to the Gautam Gambhir-led team management as India A piled on 409/3 against a lacklustre England Lions side on the opening day of the first 'Unofficial' Test in Canterbury on Friday.Although traditionally slotted at No. 4 or lower in first-class cricket, Nair looked at complete ease throughout his masterclass innings, rendering the Lions attack — including their Test spinner Rehan Ahmed — largely ineffective.India A batters capitalised on an underwhelming bowling effort on a docile pitch, but the lack of resistance from the Lions and the nature of the surface may not offer an accurate gauge of Test-level conditions.Now representing Vidarbha, the Bengaluru-born Nair put his county experience with Northamptonshire to good use, notching up his 24th first-class century. His classy knock, laced with 24 boundaries and a six, couldn’t have come at a better time as the Indian think-tank weighs up its options for the opening Test against England at Leeds on June 20. Sarfaraz Khan, who smashed a vibrant 92 off 119 balls , mixed audacity with finesse but fell short of a well-deserved hundred after doing all the hard work.Together, Sarfaraz and Nair stitched a 181-run stand for the third wicket.Later, Dhruv Jurel joined the party with an unbeaten 82 off 104 balls, forming a 177-run unbroken partnership with Nair to end the day on a commanding note for India A.Ironically, much like in the selection race for the Test squad where Nair edged out Sarfaraz, he once again outshone the Mumbai batter on a pitch offering little for the bowlers. The Lions attack, toothless for the most part, leaked 51 boundaries and three sixes across 90 overs — an alarming stat.Earlier, Yashasvi Jaiswal (24 off 55) saw off the first hour but failed to convert the start, while Abhimanyu Easwaran (8) once again raised questions about his suitability for the top level despite being handed another opportunity.Despite the greenish tinge on the Canterbury County ground surface, there was barely any lateral movement. Nair, with ample time to play his shots, was ruthless on anything short and majestic with square-of-the-wicket play. His pull shots were particularly commanding, while against off-spinner Dan Mousley, he reverse-swept with nonchalant ease.Rehan Ahmed had a forgettable outing, conceding 95 runs in 16 overs. Sarfaraz took him on confidently — reaching his fifty with an inside-out boundary and later lofting him straight for a six. Against pace, he was equally inventive, using the bounce to ramp deliveries over the slips.Sarfaraz eventually fell chasing a wide one down leg-side off Hull, a wicket even the Lions bowlers didn’t seem to expect. But the joy was fleeting for the home side as Nair and Jurel pressed on relentlessly, showing no signs of easing up.","India A piled on 409/3 against a lacklustre England Lions side on the opening day of the first 'Unofficial' Test in Canterbury.

Sabalenka shrugs off the pressure

Poll Who do you think has the best chance of winning the French Open this year? Carlos Alcaraz Iga Swiatek Aryna Sabalenka Elena Rybakina

Musetti, Rune battle through





Carlos Alcaraz survived a scare to book his place in the French Open last 16 on Friday, with defending women's champion Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka also through to the fourth round at Roland Garros.Second seed Alcaraz won 6-1, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 against 69th-ranked Bosnian Damir Dzumhur in the night session to keep his title defence on course.Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz arrived as the favourite at Roland Garros after securing the Monte Carlo Masters and Italian Open trophies in the build-up to the clay-court major.But his fluctuating performances in the past two rounds have given his rivals reason to believe he is vulnerable.""Today I honestly didn't enjoy it that much. I suffered quite a lot,"" said a relieved Alcaraz, who came from a break down in the fourth set to seal victory.""That's why doing a really good result in a Grand Slam is really difficult because you have to maintain a really high level for three to four hours.""The 22-year-old next meets American 13th seed Ben Shelton who eased past Italian qualifier Matteo Gigante 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.Swiatek kept her bid for a fourth consecutive French Open title on track, coming through 6-2, 7-5 against Romania's world number 60 Jaqueline Cristian in sweltering conditions.Swiatek broke the 60th-ranked Cristian twice in a comfortable first set, but she was pushed a lot harder by her rival in the second and had to save six break points.""She really stepped up in the second set. I had to step up as well. It was an entertaining match,"" said Swiatek, hoping to become the first woman to win four successive Roland Garros titles since Suzanne Lenglen 102 years ago.The 23-year-old Pole will next play 12th seed Elena Rybakina after the Kazakh dispatched 2017 champion Jelena Ostapenko 6-2, 6-2 in a clash of big hitters.Swiatek has a 4-4 record against Rybakina but has lost both previous meetings on clay. However she was relieved at avoiding Ostapenko, who is 6-0 against her.A grinning Swiatek suggested earlier she had no preference as to her last-16 opponent before asking: ""Am I a good liar?""""Let's say it doesn't matter, really. Oh, my God. I couldn't play poker,"" joked the world number five who has not won a title since last year's French Open.Sabalenka produced a dominant display in a 6-2, 6-3 win over 34th-ranked Serbian left-hander Olga Danilovic.But the Madrid Open winner, whose best result at Roland Garros was a semi-final in Paris two years ago, insisted the pressure was on Swiatek.""Let's just leave it (the pressure) on Iga (Swiatek) since she won it, what, three times in a row,"" said Sabalenka.The 27-year-old Belarusian next plays 16th-seeded American Amanda Anisimova who ousted Danish 22nd seed Clara Tauson 7-6 (7/4), 6-4 in their third-round tie.Zheng Qinwen ended the run of Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko 6-3, 6-4.The Chinese eighth seed has now won nine successive matches at Roland Garros following her run to Olympic gold last year.Zheng is through to the fourth round in Paris for the second time and will next play Russian 19th seed Liudmila Samsonova who brushed aside Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska 6-2, 6-3.Italian fourth seed Paolini eased past Ukrainian lucky loser Yuliia Starodubtseva 6-4, 6-1.Runner-up last year at Roland Garros and Wimbledon, Paolini next plays Ukrainian 13th seed Elina Svitolina who dug deep to see off American Bernarda Pera 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (7/5).Eighth seed Musetti won 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 against Argentine Mariano Navone as he follows on from his runner-up finish in Monte Carlo and semi-final runs in Madrid and Rome.But the Italian dropped his first set in Paris against world number 97 Navone.""I've grown up a lot. A match like this I don't know if I would (have) come back a few years ago,"" said Musetti.""The heat was pretty tough to manage. But happy to find a way to turn around the match.""Musetti next plays Rune who was two points from defeat in the fourth set before rallying past France's Quentin Halys 4-6, 6-2, 5-7, 7-5, 6-2.American Tommy Paul, the 12th seed, got past Russian Karen Khachanov 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (9/7), 3-6, 6-3 and meets Australian Alexei Popyrin, the 25th seed, who beat Portugal's Nuno Borges 6-4, 7-6 (13/11), 7-6 (7/5).Arthur Fils, the 14th seed, withdrew ahead of his third-round match on Saturday, extending the host nation's wait for a first men's champion at Roland Garros since Yannick Noah in 1983.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Damir Dzumhur to reach French Open last 16. Defending women's champion Iga Swiatek beats Jaqueline Cristian 6-2, 7-5.

'I don't want to be a one-season wonder': Punjab Kings' Shashank Singh





NEW DELHI: Opener Phil Salt smashed a 23-ball fifty — his fastest in the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) — as Royal Challengers Bengaluru stormed into the final of the 2025 season with a dominant eight-wicket win over Punjab Kings in a lopsided Qualifier 1 at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium on Thursday.RCB’s bowlers set up the emphatic victory, with Suyash Sharma and Josh Hazlewood picking up three wickets apiece to dismantle a star-studded PBKS batting line-up for just 101 runs in 14.1 overs. Salt then dazzled with a flurry of clean hits to finish unbeaten on 56 off 27 balls, steering RCB home with a staggering 10 overs to spare.With this win, RCB secured their fourth appearance in an IPL final, which will be played on June 3 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Punjab Kings, meanwhile, still have a chance to make the title clash when they play Qualifier 2 on Sunday at the same venue, against the winner of the Eliminator.Following RCB’s clinical win, former franchise pacer and legendary bowler Dale Steyn took to social media with an electrifying prediction.""Can you believe it?!?!?! RCB have won the IPL,"" Steyn wrote on his social media handle.Chasing a modest target of 102, Virat Kohli got off to a brisk start, pulling Arshdeep Singh for a boundary before glancing Kyle Jamieson for another.At the other end, Phil Salt capitalised on the extra bounce, dispatching Arshdeep for a four and a six. However, Kohli’s innings was cut short in a wicket-maiden fourth over. Jamieson bowled a back-of-a-length delivery around the sixth stump that shaped away and took the outside edge, ending Kohli's stay.With the ball moving around, Jamieson troubled Mayank Agarwal by beating him three times in an over. On the fourth delivery, Agarwal was given out, but a successful DRS review reversed the decision. Salt steadied RCB’s chase, cutting and steering Azmatullah Omarzai for a pair of boundaries.Agarwal then played a fluent on-drive, while Salt followed it up with an elegant cover drive. He further punished Jamieson by pulling and lofting him for two fours and a six in the final over of the powerplay, which yielded 21 runs. RCB raced to 61/1 at the end of the powerplay.Salt continued his assault by clearing his front leg to hammer Harpreet Brar for a six, while Agarwal lofted and drove Musheer Khan for a six and a four. But Musheer struck back, breaking the 54-run partnership by getting Agarwal to feather an edge on the flick, which was well taken at slip.Salt remained undeterred and reached his fifty in just 23 balls, celebrating the milestone with a slash through point for four. From there, RCB’s win was all but sealed. Captain Rajat Patidar joined the party, first driving Musheer for a boundary and then finishing the match in style with a powerful slog-sweep to seal a dominant victory — and a few well-earned days off — ahead of the final on June 3.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Punjab Kings by eight wickets in Qualifier 1.

NEW DELHI: Sarfaraz Khan showcased his ability to perform in overseas conditions, responding strongly after being overlooked for the Australia tour and subsequently dropped from the Test squad for the England series. The right-hander silenced his critics with a composed 92 off 119 balls for India A against England Lions in the first unofficial Test at the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury.His knock included 13 boundaries and was a timely reminder of his red-ball prowess.Earlier this year, Sarfaraz impressed on Test debut against England in February 2024, scoring two half-centuries. He later struck a valiant 150 against New Zealand in Bengaluru, though in a losing cause. However, a dip in form followed, as he managed just 21 runs in his next four innings, leading to his exclusion from the playing XI.Despite his early promise, Sarfaraz did not feature in any of the five Tests during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, where India went down 3-1.His omission continued into the England series, with the selectors opting for Sai Sudharsan and Karun Nair instead. The decision raised eyebrows, given Sarfaraz’s consistent domestic performances.The BCCI, led by chief selector Ajit Agarkar, recently announced an 18-member squad for the five-Test series in England. Shubman Gill has been appointed India’s new Test captain, with Rishabh Pant named as his deputy.Sarfaraz, however, was a notable absentee.When asked about the decision to leave Sarfaraz out, Agarkar responded:“Sometimes you just have to make good decisions. Sarfaraz, I know he got a 100 in the first Test and then didn't get runs. Sometimes it's decisions the team management takes,” Agarkar said.He further explained the inclusion of Karun Nair over Sarfaraz:“At the moment, Karun has scored heaps of runs in domestic, has played a bit of Test cricket, played a bit of county cricket. With Virat not there, clearly we're lacking a bit of experience. We felt his experience could help,"" added Agarkar.On the limited spots available in the squad, he stated:""We can't pick 50 players now, so naturally when you have to pick 18 players, some players will be missing out.""India’s five-Test series in England kicks off in Leeds on June 20.","Sarfaraz Khan scores 92 off 119 balls for India A against England Lions.

Playing XIs:





NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians won the toss and opted to bat first against Gujarat Titans in the Eliminator of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium in New Chandigarh on Friday.The decision to bat first came as a surprise, especially after a low-scoring Qualifier 1 between Punjab Kings and Royal Challengers Bengaluru on Thursday, where bowlers dominated. However, MI skipper Hardik Pandya explained that the surface for Friday’s match appeared more batting-friendly.Mumbai made three changes to their playing XI, bringing in Jonny Bairstow, Richard Gleeson, and Raj Angad Bawa in place of Ryan Rickelton, Corbin Bosch, and Will Jacks — all of whom have returned to their respective national teams.“We're going to bat. Looks like a different track than yesterday. A bit less grass. Big game, scoring runs and defending would be nice. We are all aware that for the last 9 games, we have been playing it like a knockout. Really need to turn up today and focus on the things which we can control. We've got three changes: Jonny comes back, Gleeson makes his debut, and Raj Angad Bawa plays,” Pandya said at the toss.Gujarat Titans captain Shubman Gill , leading the side after Pandya's departure in 2023, expressed his excitement about playing at home and confirmed two changes to the GT lineup.The absence of Jos Buttler, who left the tournament for international duty, was a major miss for the team.“We would've chased.

Liverpool Crash: Paul Doyle Appears Shaken Up In Court, Faces 7 Charges In Car-Ramming Incident





Real Madrid have secured the signing of Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold on a contract until 2031, with the Spanish club completing the transfer early to ensure his availability for the upcoming Club World Cup. The 26-year-old England international leaves Liverpool after winning the Premier League title in his final season.Alexander-Arnold departs his boyhood club where he made 352 appearances and achieved significant success, including the Champions League triumph in 2019 and the Premier League title in 2020.The right-back's move coincides with former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso's appointment as Real Madrid's new head coach, replacing Carlo Ancelotti.Alexander-Arnold's departure announcement initially drew negative reactions from some Liverpool supporters, who booed him in the penultimate match of the season. However, following interventions from club figures including former manager Jurgen Klopp and Mohamed Salah, fans celebrated him during the Premier League trophy presentation at Anfield.The defender joins Real Madrid during a challenging period, as the club failed to secure any major trophies this season.While known for occasional defensive lapses, Alexander-Arnold brings exceptional passing abilities and attacking prowess to the right flank.His arrival addresses Real Madrid's right-back concerns, where Dani Carvajal's long-term knee injury and Lucas Vazquez's struggles have created a void.Alexander-Arnold could make his first appearance for Real Madrid in their Club World Cup opener against Al-Hilal from Saudi Arabia on June 18 in Miami.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? The Spanish giants have also strengthened their defense by signing Spanish centre-back Dean Huijsen from Bournemouth, reinforcing a backline that suffered numerous injuries throughout the season.The transfer marks the end of Alexander-Arnold's long association with Liverpool, where he progressed from the academy to become one of the club's most successful homegrown players.","Trent Alexander-Arnold has signed for Real Madrid on a free transfer.

So, Harry, can you please share your thoughts on the season that went by?

Are you going to see through your contract which ends next year (2026)? Because we are hearing that there will be a lot of changes on the cards?

'I don't want to be a one-season wonder': Punjab Kings' Shashank Singh

What are the changes you are expecting in the coming season? Manager Ruben Amorim has promised the moon in a speech after the win against Aston Villa. What exactly is the psychology of the team when you finish 15th, and you promise that next season, the team will be making the top four?

Harry, the manager said on Tuesday that Champions League absence could benefit you. How would fans react to it and how do you expect the players to react?

IPL 2025: What went wrong for Delhi Capitals?

It's been 12 years now since United won the league. You have been with the club since 2019 and have seen the decline of the club. Can you give us an inside view about why United are failing? Is the legacy or history of the club too much weight to carry?

Marcus Rashford and Antony, who left the club on loan, found a new lease of life in other teams. Did they succumb to the scrutiny that each Manchester United player must deal with?

IPL 2025: What went wrong for Lucknow Super Giants?

Harry, two take offs from your response. Even 'homeboy' Marcus Rashford couldn't survive the scrutiny. You survived similar scrutiny and many challenges. What is your observation on Rashford leaving and Harry Maguire surviving and coming out stronger?

Even after being called 'Harrydinho' (a combination of his name and Brazilian great Ronaldinho)? Did you imagine as a young footballer, that someday you would be called 'Harrydinho'?

Since we are living in social media era, what kind of impact does online hate and trolling take on the mental health of a player? Say you make a mistake which unfortunately costs your team, in that moment, does your mind wander and you dread what the reaction on social media is going to be?

So, if you feel you've not had the game that you were hoping to have, do you just stay away from social media for a few days?

Once you look back, would you consider your games under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as the best part of your time at United?

And after that, not getting picked by Thomas Tuchel and after you finished so well this season. Do you feel like you should be in the England team?

After that crazy night in Lyon, one's mind almost goes back to 1999 in Barcelona. How well do you remember that Champions League final versus Bayern Munich?

Looking forward, you will be losing your centre back partner all these years, Victor Lindelof. If given a choice as a senior member in the squad, who would you like as your partner in defence for the next season?

Harry, you mentioned about travelling to Asia and you were very vocal about the club needing to generate money by travelling to Asia, considering that you would have lost a lot of TV money because of the position that the club ended up in. Are spreadsheets, accounts and revenues also on the minds of players these days or is it just about goals and assists?

Which would you say is the heavier shirt at this moment to wear, Harry? The United shirt or the England shirt?

How does something like this Apollo Tyres United We Play initiative help especially after a tough season?





After England's rare 2-0 win over Germany in Euro 2020, Juergen Klinsmann, the German legend raved about Harry Maguire's robust performance. He hailed the then Manchester United captain as a 'leader' who grabs the game by the scruff of the neck. “I coached Bayern Munich and had a Brazilian centre-back called Lucio, he was similar to Maguire,” Klinsmann had said. After finishing 15th in the Premier League and without a trophy to show for — having just completed a worst top-flight season since 1973-74 — Maguire is luckily not the person trolled by the media or the fans. However, he has some strong views on online trolling of players. He finished the season on a personal high and is likely to survive the Amorim purge that is on the cards.In Mumbai, donning an ambassadorial role for Manchester United organised by Apollo Tyres, Maguire took out time to talk to TOI about his Manchester United journey that started as being the highest-paid defender in the world to the present day when national coach Thomas Tuchel left him out of the England squad, albeit with some consolatory words. He also talked about chai, kebabs and an afternoon out playing footy with the kids.Excerpts...I think it was a disappointing season. As players we take responsibility. It was nowhere near good enough for the club standard and the history that the club has. It's all built around winning games. So, this season was disappointing, there's no doubt about that. And we've got a lot of work to do. We'll have a break now after this Asian tour. Then we'll get ready for a fresh start. Obviously, the manager has come in with new ideas and will have a full pre-season to work with us. I'm sure we will improve a lot.In football, it's natural when you have a disappointing season, I think there's going to be a lot of players who leave the club and a lot of players who will join. I have one year left on my deal, so it is down to the manager. Obviously at my age (32) I don't really want to be going into my last year and leaving it too late and then deciding. So, I think we will have to come to a decision, whether it's this transfer window or if the manager desperately wants to keep me, then we will make a decision on extending that contract. I would like to play a part in rebuilding this club.We all feel we can improve. I think we are in a little bit of a false position in the Premier League because we did focus on the Europa League so much. We put all our efforts to win the Europa League. I think you've seen in the last couple of games against Chelsea and Aston Villa, where we played as a more consistent team. I think our performances were a lot better. We could have won the game at Chelsea easily. And then we dominated Villa from start to finish. We could have finished with a bigger scoreline, really. Having said that, I still believe it's not been good enough.There are so many areas to improve. And like I've said, there'll be a lot of players who will leave. And that's part and parcel of being at a big club. It's obviously down to the club and the manager who they want to keep and who they want to bring in and strengthen the areas which need reinforcements. Because as Manchester United, we need to win football matches and we haven't done that this year.Well, I think as a club, we want to be in the Champions League. Of course we do. And as players, we want to be part of the Champions League night. But is the team ready to go and win the Champions League next year? No, it's not. So that's the idea behind the manager's comment. His thinking is that he will have long weeks to improve this squad of players and to improve their principles and to improve our fitness levels, our physicality and our demands. Because he wants to change a lot of things at the club, he will get more time to implement his ideas than by playing more games. Because when you're playing games in a week and then at the weekend, you're not really training. You're just recovering and then you're playing. So, the manager has got that idea in his head. Of course, I know the manager and he's ambitious. He wants to be playing in the Champions League, but he understands he has constraints. He understands the reality that we finished 15th in the Premier League this year, and to win the Champions League next year, it would be highly unlikely. But this club demands that he should be playing in the top competitions. But our form this year has proven that we've not been good enough or consistent enough to play in the Champions League.I wouldn't put it down to that. T he competition now is different in the Premier League. That's a big reason. You have teams now paying 40, 50, 60 million pounds to players despite the side finishing 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th in the Premier League. The money spent in the Premier League is crazy from every team who's in there. That's why you're seeing the teams coming up from the championship struggling more because the competition now is so fierce. You have teams like Manchester City, who have come into the mix in the last 10 years.They have obviously done excellent, but they have spent a lot of money doing that. But the tide will turn again and the club will go back in the right direction. We're speaking about a bad era and a bad time for Manchester United. But in the last five years we've been in five major finals. That's a golden era for a lot of other teams. Yes, it's been a bad couple of years. But we won the FA Cup last year, we lost in the Europa League final this year, but it has been a bad two years in the Premier League.Obviously, my first two years under Ole (Gunnar Solskjær) were good. We finished third, we finished second, we lost in the Europa League final on penalties (2021) where we were the better team throughout the game. These moments can define you as a player and as a player for a club. I mean I've lost two Europa League finals now and I could easily be sat here with two Europa League winners' medals. But that's part and parcel of football. You win some and lose some.For sure, the last two years have been nowhere near good enough. We've just lost too many games, and I think there's been a big transition period over the last year or so with the ownership and the manager and things like that and a lot of things happening behind the scenes. But they're putting it in a position where they can climb again.I think this club has so much spotlight on it and so much scrutiny on it and so much everyone analysing it, that it has so many different opinions across the globe. And if anybody speaks about this club, it makes headlines. So, any former player who has an opinion on the club, it makes a headline, whether that's positive or negative - negative really makes the news. And I think if you're signing for this club, I think you've got to be prepared for that. You will not have it smooth sailing. I can remember watching the best Manchester United teams with Wayne Rooney and David Beckham, and they got a lot of stick from the press during certain periods of their career at this club. So, if you're wanting a long, successful career at Manchester United, it will not be smooth all the way.You will have times where you'll have to dig in, you'll have to fight. And the press and the scrutiny and the punditry will be questioning you. When you play for this club and you lose a game of football, everyone speaks about how they're going to replace you in the summer. But it's just part and parcel of playing for this club. And when you come to places like India and you see the fan base that we have out here, we have the greatest fans in the world. We have a fan base which is worldwide. And handling scrutiny is something one must learn quickly.And I think, the players that are coming into the club, people who are signing them, should make them aware that it's not just going to be an easy ride. They should have the mentality and the mindset to deal with those setbacks.I think it's two different scenarios, if I'm honest. Rashford's been at the club all his life. Sometimes, when you have been at the club so long, a new challenge or something away from the club sparks a little bit of new energy and that's what has happened to Marcus. Marcus is a wonderful player, but, yeah, I don't know what's going to happen. He might come back next season and start performing and start playing for Manchester United again. I was just prepared for the setbacks, and I am grounded where if people speak highly about me and my game, I just tend to stay level and don't read too much praise or too much negativity. I just try and do my best every day, try and work as hard and that's what I feel you can do as a footballer.(Laughs) No, I think it's all fun. Obviously, I've had some great moments this season. It's been a difficult season, of course. I hate coming off the football pitch after losing. It's the worst feeling in the world and it's happened so much this season. So, the moments that we have had, obviously the Lyon goal and the Bilbao games and I've scored a couple of late goals as well in this season. So the big moments in games have been pleasing for me because they create a lot of memories and they're the moments that the fans remember.Obviously scoring the last minute against Lyon was special with all my family in the stands and obviously to score the first goal in Bilbao, which was a crucial goal in the tie. But yeah, these are the moments that when you finish your career, you will look back on and look back at them with a big smile on your face.I wouldn't say my mind does, but I think it does affect a lot of players. I think people get invested far too much in social media. And the thing on social media is that you just read when you're going through a bad time. The negative comments are always the ones that you read and get blown out of proportion. Obviously, there are highlights too on social media and analysis of games too has become so big that, at Manchester United, if you pass a ball out of play, then there's probably going to be a video going around viral of you and everyone tries to make fun of you. For me, I tend to just not read too much on social media. I try to use it to my benefits, where I can interact with my fans and show them what I'm doing socially sometimes. But apart from that, whether I score a last-minute winner or make a mistake, I don't read the comments. That's important to do because social media is such a big part of the world and everybody is invested in it, but as footballers, you can't really get too invested in it because it always comes back to hurt you.Yeah, definitely. Even if I had a good game after which I post something, I still wouldn't be flicking through it more or searching more. I don't think there's any need to. Because, as a player, you know when you've played well, and you know when you can do better. I think the most important thing is you can only every day go into training and just try and improve and try and work as hard as you can. And then whatever happens on the pitch, it happens on the pitch.It's life. Things happen; you make mistakes. But of course, when you play for Manchester United, especially in the Premier League, it gets spoken about. Everyone knows that if you write a headline on Manchester United players, it gets more clicks than any other team. That's common knowledge. That's why we are one of the biggest clubs in the world with a worldwide fan base. We have amazing fans, but obviously a lot of the other fans as well aren't too keen on us.Yeah, definitely. Those were my prime years. People have asked me if this year has been my best year. Performance wise, it hasn't. I performed well this year, but of course the first two years under Ole, I took a team from conceding a lot of goals the previous year to a team that kept the most clean sheets in Europe. The second year, I think it was the second most clean sheets in Europe. Finished third, finished second, had a great defensive record. And yeah, obviously the first year, the squad wasn't amazing like in terms of talent or wage bills and things. So yeah, they were my best two years of my playing career, along with the previous few with Leicester as well. Then I obviously had a bad six months, but then I think my performance over the last couple of years now has been where it should be and been really consistent.Yeah, obviously it was disappointing. I thought I would have been in the team, but no, he's obviously spoke out and I'm sure he's made his decision for a reason. I haven't spoken to him. So, no, it's time to work again next season and do everything I can to give him no choice but to put me back in the team. It's been a frustrating 18 months with England, I must say, just because I've been unfortunate with injuries every time. Obviously the Euros last summer, where I would have started every game, I had to pull out with my calf and then I was in the next camp and then I haven't been in a camp since just because of my calf injuries or different injuries. And then this one, the squad was announced, and he's obviously gone down a different path with giving others opportunities and now it's down to me next season to give him no opportunity but to put me back on the team.I was a young boy, I was only born in 1993. But I've seen a lot of clips. And obviously there was Ole (scored the 93rd-min winner). He's been my manager and a big mentor. I must say he's had a big influence in my career. It's an iconic football moment. It's a huge moment in this club's history and now it's one that if you play for this club, you cherish.We have obviously a lot of very good defenders. I don't really focus on who my partner will be. Speaking on Victor, he's been a wonderful servant for Manchester United. It was a pleasure to play alongside him. He's an amazing guy, a top footballer, really underrated footballer. And we had some great years together. Our partnership in my first two years at the club speaks for itself. The facts are there. The clean sheets that we kept together.No, I think as a player you're more focused on the pitch, of course. I think we see coming to Asia as an opportunity to see the fans and to see different cultures. I haven't come over here thinking about how much money… we don't know yet. We don't have a clue what you're talking money wise. But I think it's just amazing to come over here and just see our fans. And when you come to places like this, you get a real feel on how big the club is and how special the club is. And it gives you really great pride to play for this club when you come away from places like Malaysia and India and you see the fans; how passionate they are. So that's what our feeling is as players.(Laughs gently) Good question. No, I think it's amazing to wear both shirts. When I was a young boy, if you would have asked me two things I wanted to do, it would be to play for Manchester United and play for England. So, I'm the luckiest man alive, I believe. It's been a pleasure to play nearly 250 games for Manchester United, 60 odd games for England.Yeah, it's been a real nice day. It's been amazing to see the different culture and to meet a lot of people and to spend the afternoon playing with children and just seeing how happy they are and putting smiles on their faces. I think that's been so important. It's nice and refreshing to come over here.",Harry Maguire has been at Manchester United since 2019.

'I don't want to be a one-season wonder': Punjab Kings' Shashank Singh





MUMBAI: From being booed off the pitch after a 1-0 friendly defeat to a Southeast Asian XI in Malaysia, Harry Maguire, Andre Onana and Diogo Dalot arrived to a much warmer embrace by Manchester United supporters in the city on Thursday.After a forgettable season which culminated in last week’s defeat in the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur, the Red Devils trio looked a lot more relaxed engaging with young footballers at Cooperage Stadium at the launch of the fifth edition of United We Play, an Apollo Tyres initiative. “It’s nice and refreshing to come over here,” Maguire told TOI. “It’s been amazing to see the different culture and to meet a lot of people and to spend the afternoon playing with children and just seeing how happy they are and putting smiles on their faces. ”For Dalot, coming to India was a box he had always been wanting to tick. “It was on my checklists to come to India, so I’m happy that I’ve been able to come here, also with the club,” said the Portuguese full back, aware of his country’s old link with India. “Historically, Portugal have good connections with India. I would love to go to Goa one day.""Since I moved to Man United, I am aware the amount of supporters we have here is growing.So for me, it was one of the reasons why I volunteered to come here, because I knew that as soon as I leave this place, (visiting India) will be something that I would be very happy to have done.""Like Maguire and Dalot, Onana also wore a broad smile as he took part in a few drills with the youngsters on Thursday, a pleasant change, no doubt, for the Cameroon international who has often drawn the ire of United fans for his performances in goal since his $56m move to Old Trafford from Inter Milan two summers ago.Asked if the pressure of being David de Gea’s successor had been weighing on him, the 29-year-old dismissed the notion. “Pressure? I don't feel pressure. First of all, thank you for putting my name next to a legend who has done a lot of things for the club, amazing things. It’s not pressure, it’s an extra motivation,"" Onana said.Still close to many of his former teammates at Inter, Onana didn't shy away from revealing he would be cheering on his old team in Saturday’s Uefa Champions League final against Paris Saint-Germain in Munich.“I hope they win,” he said of Simone Inzaghi’s side. “Obviously they play against a very good team. Of course I’m in touch with them, they are my guys. For me it’s good always to talk with them. I wish them all the best, and hopefully Inter win. Forza Inter!""","Harry Maguire, Andre Onana and Diogo Dalot were booed off the pitch after a 1-0 friendly defeat to a Southeast Asian XI in Malaysia.

IPL 2025: What went wrong for Lucknow Super Giants?

IPL 2025: What went wrong for Delhi Capitals?

Paris, May 29, 2025 -Khvicha Kvaratskhelia has already played a part in denying Inter Milan the Serie A title this season, and the Georgian is now hoping to get the better of them again with Paris Saint-Germain in Saturday's Champions League final.The 24-year-old Kvaratskhelia moved to Paris in January from Napoli for a reported 70 million euros ($79.2m) plus bonuses.He is set to have a key role to play for Luis Enrique's side against Inter in Munich, despite missing last weekend's French Cup final victory over Reims as a precaution due to a minor fitness issue.Perhaps he had been up late the previous night celebrating his former club's Serie A triumph, as Napoli pipped Inter to the Scudetto in their final game of the season.Napoli's second Italian league championship in three campaigns was claimed despite 'Kvara', one of the stars of their title in 2023, leaving the team in the middle of the season.Instrumental two years ago when he earned the nickname 'Kvaradona' at the club where Diego Maradona is an icon, he played a pivotal part in the early weeks of this season under Antonio Conte, scoring five goals in the first 10 Serie A games -- only four Napoli players finished the campaign with more goals, including Scott McTominay.Kvaratskhelia can therefore claim an Italian league winner's medal for this season as well as one for Ligue 1 for his contribution towards PSG's cruise to the domestic title.However, his transfer to PSG has really aided the French side in Europe, where the extra competition for places in attack has helped bring the best out of fellow forwards Ousmane Dembele, Bradley Barcola and Desire Doue.The left-winger who loves to play with his socks rolled down around his ankles also fits perfectly into coach Luis Enrique's system, which demands that the attackers do their bit to help the team defensively.""He is perfectly adaptable to our way of playing. He is versatile. He can go past players and he can also defend which is essential because we need to be able to defend as 11 players and attack as 11 players,"" Luis Enrique said in January.""He fits into our idea of how to play football.""- Key for PSG already -Kvaratskhelia has so far contributed six goals and six assists in 24 appearances for PSG, including one magnificent strike against Aston Villa in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final and the pass to set up Dembele's winning goal away to Arsenal in the semis.PSG had already started to turn a corner following a sluggish start this season when the former Rubin Kazan player arrived, but Luis Enrique is convinced Kvaratskhelia's presence has been essential in his team getting to Munich.""If you analyse in depth how we have improved defensively, it comes down to the way the attackers help out. The way they defend is exceptional, and the statistics show how many balls they recover for us,"" the coach said last week.The PSG boss still faces a difficult decision over which one of his four main attackers to leave out of the front three on the night -- 33-goal top scorer Dembele is certain to start, meaning one of the in-form Doue or the lively Barcola will have to drop to the bench if Kvaratskhelia is to be in the starting XI.But his experience of playing Inter could be invaluable, even if Simone Inzaghi's side fared well when they came up against him at Napoli.Kvaratskhelia won just once in six clashes against the Nerazzurri with his former club, and has never scored against them.""Technically he's a special player so it won't be easy,"" insisted Denzel Dumfries, Inter's Dutch right wing-back who is likely to be in direct opposition to Kvaratskhelia on the night.Can Inter this time be celebrating at his expense or will Kvaratskhelia get his hands on another winner's medal on Saturday?",Khvicha Kvaratskhelia is set to start for Paris Saint-Germain in Saturday's Champions League final against Inter Milan. The 24-year-old Georgian moved to Paris in January from Napoli for a reported 70 million euros ($79.2m) plus bonuses. The left-winger has so far contributed six goals and six assists in 24 appearances for PSG.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121494065,imgsize-108474,width-400,resizemode-4/121494065.jpg"

IPL 2025: What went wrong for Delhi Capitals?

Paris Saint-Germain coach Luis Enrique, who took charge in July 2023 following the departures of Lionel Messi and Neymar, has transformed the team into a formidable force ahead of this weekend's Champions League final. The 55-year-old Spanish manager has revived his reputation after being dismissed by Spain post their 2022 World Cup exit, molding PSG into one of Europe's most feared sides despite the challenge of replacing departing superstar Kylian Mbappe Luis Enrique arrived at PSG during a period of transition, with the club moving away from its star-studded attacking trio of Messi, Neymar, and Mbappe, who were known for their limited defensive contributions.The departure of Messi and Neymar, followed by Mbappe's impending exit, allowed Luis Enrique to implement his vision for the team.PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi acknowledged this shift in philosophy early in the season, stating: ""We are in the middle of building a new identity, our own style and way of playing, and a new culture."" He added that winning the Champions League was no longer ""something we are obsessed with.""In his first season, Luis Enrique led PSG to a domestic league and cup double, along with reaching the Champions League semi-finals before losing to Borussia Dortmund.Despite Mbappe's imminent departure, Luis Enrique remained confident about the team's future. ""If everything goes well I'm convinced we'll have a much better team than this year,"" he said in February 2024.The Spanish coach's tactical approach emphasizes possession-based football and aggressive pressing, though some critics, including former player Iago Aspas, have questioned his flexibility. ""Luis Enrique had a very clear game plan, and when plan A didn't work, there was no plan B,"" Aspas remarked.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Early season struggles and a defeat to Bayern Munich in November threatened PSG's Champions League campaign. When questioned about his tactics after losing to Arsenal, Luis Enrique responded: ""I have no intention of explaining my tactics to you. You wouldn't understand.""The team's transformation has been remarkable since then, with impressive victories over Manchester City, Liverpool, Aston Villa, and Arsenal.Luis Enrique successfully converted winger Ousmane Dembele into a prolific scorer, with 33 goals this season, proving his decision to play without a traditional striker effective.The coach, who previously won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2015, now stands on the brink of joining an elite group of managers who have won the trophy multiple times.Reflecting on his past success, Luis Enrique said: ""Getting to a Champions League final is always difficult. All players and coaches dream of it, but not everyone gets there. The job I did at Barca was extraordinary. Even if people said it was easy to win the Champions League with that team, it wasn't.""Between his Barcelona tenure and PSG appointment, Luis Enrique managed Spain twice, taking a break in 2019 following his daughter Xana's death from bone cancer.Drawing from these experiences, he believes he's evolved as a coach. ""I have more experience now. I remember before my first final I was really stressed,"" he shared. ""This time I hope to transmit a message of calm. Otherwise I think I have learnt from my mistakes and that has helped me get where I am now.""",Luis Enrique has transformed Paris Saint-Germain into one of Europe's most feared sides.

RCB vs PBKS, IPL 2025, Qualifier 1: Quick singles from Mullanpur

Chelsea secured their place in football history by defeating Real Betis 4-1 in the UEFA Conference League final in Wroclaw on Wednesday, becoming the first club to win all five UEFA club tournaments. Despite falling behind early, Chelsea's second-half performance, sparked by Cole Palmer's brilliance, saw them score four unanswered goals through Enzo Fernandez, Nicolas Jackson, Jadon Sancho, and Moises Caicedo.The victory marks Chelsea's first trophy under Todd Boehly's ownership, which began in 2022, and completes their collection of UEFA trophies, including the Champions League, Europa League, Conference League, Super Cup, and the Cup Winners' Cup.Real Betis started strongly, taking the lead in the ninth minute when Abde Ezzalzouli converted after a clever pass from captain Isco, following Malo Gusto's loss of possession.The Spanish side dominated the first half, with Marc Bartra testing goalkeeper Filip Jorgensen from distance and Johnny Cardoso coming close with a deflected shot.Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca's strategic substitutions in the second half transformed the game, particularly the introduction of Reece James for the struggling Gusto.""The club have invested lots of money in the last three or four years, so they are also waiting for results,"" Maresca told TNT Sports. ""Hopefully this can be a starting point and from tonight, from this season, (we are) building something important.""Cole Palmer's influence proved decisive, first providing a precise cross for Fernandez's equalizing header in the 65th minute.Five minutes later, Palmer's skill created another opportunity, setting up Jackson for Chelsea's second goal.Substitute Jadon Sancho extended Chelsea's lead in the 83rd minute, combining with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall before finishing from an angle.Moises Caicedo completed the scoring with a strike from the edge of the box, sealing Chelsea's comprehensive victory.The result ends an extraordinary run of Spanish success in major finals, breaking a sequence of 27 consecutive victories for Spanish teams in various competitions including World Cups, European Championships, Champions League, and UEFA Cup/Europa League.Chelsea's triumph caps a successful end to their season, having also secured Champions League qualification with a fourth-place finish in the Premier League.Todd Boehly joined the celebrations on the pitch after the match, marking a significant moment in his ownership of the club.The final was played against a backdrop of fan tensions in Wroclaw, with Polish Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak reporting 28 arrests following clashes between supporters in the city's market square.",Chelsea beat Real Betis 4-1 in the UEFA Conference League final in Wroclaw.

Chhetri’s return bad news for Indian football: Venkatesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/chhetris-return-bad-news-for-indian-football-venkatesh/articleshow/121448497.cms,"Venkatesh Shanmugam

CHENNAI: Back in 2005, as the India captain, Venkatesh Shanmugam had urged a fading senior to step aside so that an eager 20-year-old Sunil Chhetri could get his chance. It was a bold call then. And now, with Chhetri stepping back onto the international stage after ‘retirement’, Venkatesh voices a deep-seated disappointment. The man who once cleared the path for Chhetri is left wondering why Indian football isn’t doing the same for those waiting in the wings.“Two decades ago, I told a senior player to hang up his boots so a young Sunil Chhetri could rise,” Venkatesh, who is currently the technical director at FC Madras, told TOI. “But now, Chhetri breaking his retirement to come back is bad news for Indian football. It’s demotivating for all the young players. I’m not blaming Chhetri. He will play only one or two matches. But if you bring a youngster and back him now, he will give 10 years.“Indirectly, we are sending a message to everyone that we don’t have players. We are seeing that a lot of grassroots programme have come and there are a lot of tournaments. Still, we are depending on the 40-year-old striker?”Venkatesh, a former assistant coach of the India senior team, didn’t mince words on the chaos surrounding head coach Manolo Marquez, who had a dual role while coaching FC Goa and the national team.“We are going 20 years back,” the star midfield of his time bluntly said. “We have done this before. We failed when Armando Colaco was coach for both Dempo and the national team (in 2011). We have to bring a permanent coach. I respect all the coaches, including Manolo. But which coach will think about Indian football and take risks for it? That’s a big question.”Venkatesh, who holds an AFC Pro Licence, explained the differences between coaching a club and steering a national team and how each demands a separate mindset and level of commitment.“Thanks to the ISL (Indian Super League), they brought a lot of attention to football in India. But when you play in the ISL, the Indian players will play only against four foreigners. When we go for international games, you have to face eleven foreigners. The temperament is completely different. You can’t compare ISL and international football. Tomorrow, if you play against a team like Korea, you need solid preparation. It’s true Manolo has done well as an ISL coach and that’s why AIFF thought he knew Indian football well. But international football is something different,” said Venkatesh.So, what’s the way forward? For Venkatesh, it starts with looking beyond the obvious. “I feel this is high time that Indian football bosses think seriously about building a second layer. There has to be a Team ‘A’ and a Team ‘B’. Fill Team B with young players, give them time and space to grow. The only thing that separates a star from the rest is opportunity. And when there’s pressure for places in the first team, it naturally brings out the best in players,” the 46-year-old said.Venkatesh is optimistic about the current bunch of Indian players. “I can see that the current Indian players, in terms of technique and physicality, are very strong. If you see all the players, all the positions, you can see aggression. Indian football is more aggressive now,” said Venkatesh.Venkatesh also pointed out that there is a lack of a proper bridge between youth and senior levels. “I feel we should concentrate more on the under-21 category, then only you will get a strong core for the future. There’s a big gap post the under-19 level. Players are jumping straight into the senior team without proper progression. The under-21 level is the backbone of Indian football,” he said.",Venkatesh Shanmugam says Indian football needs to build a second layer. The former India captain is disappointed by the decision of Sunil Chhetri to return to the national team. He also believes there is a lack of a proper bridge between youth and senior levels.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121448443,imgsize-802088,width-400,resizemode-4/121448443.jpg"

More Than a Team: The Rise of CSK & the Whistle Podu Army

Chelsea were once one of Europe's most well-run clubs under their former owner Roman Abramovich, with a focus on shrewd transfer dealings and value creation. There was specific emphasis on signing proven campaigners, which paid off handsomely, with the Blues winning two Champions League titles as well as five Premier League trophies. However, Abramovich was forced to sell the club to a consortium led by American billionaire Todd Boehly, turning things upside down. Financial wisdom went out the window, with players purchased at immensely extravagant sums. A recent UEFA report stated that Chelsea spent almost two billion euros in transfer fees from 2020 to 2024, terming the club's 2024 squad as ""the most expensive ever assembled.""Close to 39 transfers have been completed in just two years, resulting in fans and experts terming the decision-making ""madness."" Boehly's stint drew controversy early on following the decision to sack the club's 2021 Champions League-winning manager Thomas Tuchel. The billionaire picked ex-Brighton manager Graham Potter as a replacement, which failed miserably, as Chelsea finished 12th in the 2022/23 season after a third-place finish. Former Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino also failed to transform fortunes, leading to yet another managerial vacancy.While pundits expected Boehly to re-appoint Tuchel, the billionaire took an unprecedented decision by handing over charge to ex-Leicester City manager Enzo Maresca at the start of the 2024/25 season. The decision seemed quite brazen, considering Maresca had no formal Premier League experience as a manager. While the transfer merry-go-round continued under Maresca, with 11 new players signed including Jadon Sancho, the Italian manager developed a robust system around young and hungry players.Maresca faced a tough start to his stint, as the Blues conceded easy goals in friendlies and suffered a loss in their opening PL match against Manchester City. However, the Italian took a leaf out of his former boss Pep Guardiola's playbook by retaining self-belief amid pressure. Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez, Cole Palmer, and Levi Colwill formed the core of the setup, with Maresca placing trust in Nicolas Jackson despite the striker's inexperience. There was also heavy focus on versatility to catch the opposition unawares, with full-backs Marc Cucurella and Malo Gusto inverting into midfield.""Maresca picked the two best players for every position with emphasis on versatile players like Gusto who can play either as a right-back or a central midfielder,"" said Spanish football manager Mario Rivera.Chelsea dominated proceedings in the season's first half with fast, fluid, and explosive football, smashing goals for fun. While Palmer had already developed a reputation as a game-changer, emerging players like Noni Madueke also made their presence felt, as evident from the latter's 14-minute hat-trick against Wolves.""The main tactical change in the Chelsea setup is the numeric superiority in the central channel. While attacking, they operate in a 3-2-2-3 formation with four midfielders, offering greater control. The high-press system gives Chelsea a chance to play far off the goalpost with much more balance for transitions,"" stated Rivera.Chelsea were well in contention for the league title until December after jumping to the second spot, resulting in fans chanting, ""We have our Chelsea back."" However, injuries to crucial players like defender Wesley Fofana and Jackson, as well as Mykhailo Mudryk's long-term suspension, impacted results over a crucial two-month period, pushing Maresca into a spot of bother. While experts stated that opponents had figured out the Italian's gameplay, there were also question marks over the system's intensity, resulting in fatigue.Three wins in 12 matches between December 22 and February 22 pushed Chelsea to sixth place, resulting in heavy criticism over the quality of recruitment. However, Maresca's 'band of brothers' kept marching on, with Champions League qualification coming down to their final Premier League match against Nottingham Forest — who had been brilliant themselves. Colwill stepped up in this crucial encounter, vindicating the Italian manager's faith by scoring the winner.Maresca's brilliance enabled Chelsea to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since Boehly's takeover, recording the feat with the youngest average line-up in Premier League history — 24 years and 36 days. ""The doubt was from outside. Critics were saying that we were not able to win because we are too young and inexperienced. F**k off to all of them,"" said the Italian manager in a no-holds-barred retort after a league season which has revived Chelsea's flagging fortunes.","Chelsea were once one of Europe's most well-run clubs, with a focus on shrewd transfer dealings and value creation.

Shanghai E-Prix 2025 FP1 results

Sam Bird – New York (2017)

Antonio Félix da Costa – Berlin (2020)

Mitch Evans – Rome (2022)

Pascal Wehrlein – Diriyah (2023)

In Formula E, a double-header means double the thrill—and fans make sure they don’t miss a moment. Taking place over a weekend, these back-to-back races offer spectators twice the action, twice the drama, and twice the excitement. Despite the electrifying atmosphere, the roaring crowds, and the intense competition, only five drivers in Formula E’s 10-year history have managed to win both races of a double-header weekend. Here’s a look at the elite few who have pulled off this rare feat:Nicolas Jean Prost, better known as Nico Prost, became the first-ever driver in Formula E to win both races of a double-header weekend.

Driving for DS Virgin Racing, Bird secured back-to-back wins during Formula E’s debut in New York City in 2017. It was also the first time an international motor race was held in the city, and Bird captivated fans with his commanding performance over the weekend.Antonio Félix da Costa became the third driver to win a double-header, doing so in a unique and challenging setting. Representing DS Techeetah, he clinched victories during the first of three double-headers in Berlin in 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the final six races of the season were held in Berlin, making da Costa’s consistency even more remarkable.Jaguar TCS Racing’s Mitch Evans had a slow start to the 2022 season, scoring just one point from the first three races. But he turned things around dramatically in Rome, where he dominated the weekend, starting from ninth and powering through to victory. He capped it off with a stunning lead of 5.703 seconds in one of the races.Also Read: Revisiting Antonio Felix Da Costa’s epic high-altitude pool dive after his Monaco E-Prix win Pascal Wehrlein delivered one of the most impressive double-header wins in recent memory.

Stoffel Vandoorne shares their strategy for Tokyo race

It cannot be just a coincidence that Maserati MSG Racing driver Stoffel Vandoorne started from the 14th position on the grid and went on to win the Tokyo E-Prix Round 8. He even managed to beat Nissan’s Oliver Rowland, who had started from pole. Vandoorne shined while others struggled with poor visibility, a slippery track, and grip issues as it rained cats and dogs during the Tokyo race. Not only that, he also recovered from a spin on the wet track to cross the finish line first. The Tokyo winner says it’s all because of how their plan fell in place to perfection.Stoffel Vandoorne revealed that their winning strategy involved a calculated risk of taking the Pit Boost early in the race, which could have worked in their favor if there had been a race stoppage, allowing them to save time during the gap.""It was not an easy race, but a lot of opportunities with the rain and the management. We kind of gamble a little bit with our strategy but it was also calculated at the same time. The plan perfectly played in our hands, and the chances of this happening in Formula E are very, very slim,” Vandoorne told Formula E in an interview.""It was difficult because I had to manage so many things. I was on the radio with my engineer in between laps and he was giving me advice on the gap that I had to Oliver (Rowland) to make sure I was safe enough with my energy.I was struggling, and I was down to 10% at some point and I had to bring the car home so there was a lot of management to do,"" he added.Vandoorne moved to Maserati MSG Racing last season and is in love with his new team. Talking about the same, he said, ""I’m just happy for the team, for myself, it’s been a little while. They are such a good group of people, some familiar faces from the past as well, their vibe is super cool, their base is Monaco and that is my home as well.

The Philippe Chatrier Court has been half-full for most of the day sessions this week, not on Thursday though. For Richard Gasquet, a former top-10 player, and the owner of an elegant single-handed backhand, it was a full house for his last outing.The Frenchman was up against the world No. 1 Jannik Sinner. Both men were given standing ovations when they walked into the stadium. No sooner had play started and the roar on Chatrier echoed across the grounds with chants of ‘Reeshard’ clap, clap, clap; ‘Reeshard’ clap, clap, clap filling the late afternoon air.When Gasquet produced two backhand winners, down-the-line, catching Sinner out of position in the first of the veteran’s service games, it raised visions. The Italian was having none of that though as he powered to a 6-3, 6-0, 6-4 second-round win in shade under two-hours.Gasquet, who played in the era of the big three – Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic – made three Grand Slam semifinals, twice at Wimbledon and once in New York, suffered a calf injury in the lead up to his farewell tournament.Sinner, 23, took his time settling down on the clay, having played his first-round match under lights in vastly different conditions. “In the evening, the ball bounces less. It can play a bit more flatter, because the ball doesn’t pop up like it did today,” he said. “Today, it was at times a bit cloudy, at times was sunny. Different conditions.”Sinner, who had some support in the stands, applauded the home crowd, saying they were respectful. “When you play against French players here, it’s a little bit different, the atmosphere. It’s the same when I play in Italy,” he said.","France's Richard Gasquet beat Italy's Jannik Sinner in straight sets.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes





Arthur Fils gave everything he could lay his hands on to spectators at Court Suzanne Lenglen — t-shirts, sweat bands, towels and then some more. Just as well that he saved his rackets.The expressive 20-year-old showed gratitude to fans, who steered him out of a mid-match slump, courtesy a shaky lower back, to script a dramatic turnaround. At one point, from midway through the third set, Fils had lost 13 of 14 games to trail Spain's Jaume Munar 1-3 in the deciding fifth set. Fils, who had slowed down considerably, was suddenly in full flight.A couple of five-set matches, played on different courts at Roland Garros, became the talking point of the tournament. Alex De Minaur, the French Open 's ninth seed, and Fils, the 14th seed, finished at two ends of the spectrum in their second-round outings.The 26-year-old Aussie and the effusive Frenchman both won the first two sets on Thursday, but lost the next two. Fils, battling a lower back injury, struggled with movement after two hours of play.The home crowd with calls of ‘allez' and ‘ole' shored up the 14th seed.The Frenchman, who was particularly aggressive in the fifth set, slamming 20 winners in the 56-minute deciding set, scored a 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4), 2-6, 0-6, 6-4 win in four-hours and 30-minutes. On the other hand, De Minaur, on Court 14, went down 6-2, 6-2, 4-6, 3-6, 2-6 in just under three-hours. Fils plays Andrey Rublev in the third round.De Minaur, who hadn't dropped a set to Bublik in their previous three meetings, didn't mince words, pinning his loss squarely on mental fatigue. “I'm tired mentally, a little bit burnt out, if anything. A lot of tennis is being played,” De Minaur said.After limping out of Roland Garros on Wednesday, Casper Ruud, the two-time French Open finalist, called the rankings a ‘rat race'. “You feel obligated to play, you feel like you lose a lot if you don't show up and play,” Ruud said, after his 2nd-round exit.De Minaur joined the chorus in calling for a shorter schedule. “What's going to happen is players' careers are going to get shorter and shorter because they'll burn out mentally,” he said. “There's just too much tennis.”","Arthur Fils beats Alex De Minaur in five sets in French Open second round. The Frenchman won 7-6 (3), 7-4, 2-6, 6-4 in four-hours and 30-minutes. The Aussie went down 6-2, 6.2, 4- 6, 3-6 and 6-6 in just under three-hours.

IPL 2025: What went wrong for Lucknow Super Giants?

Paris, May 29, 2025 -Jannik Sinner ended the retiring Richard Gasquet's career with a one-sided victory at the French Open on Thursday, while Novak Djokovic looks to sharpen his game in the second round in his pursuit of a 25th Grand Slam title.Women's second seed and former Roland Garros finalist Coco Gauff also targets a place in the last 32, after 18-year-old contender Mirra Andreeva cruised through.World number one Sinner had no trouble in seeing off the 38-year-old Gasquet, playing at the tournament for the 22nd and final time, 6-3, 6-0, 6-4 in under two hours.Sinner made his comeback from a three-month doping ban at the Italian Open earlier in May, reaching the final before losing in straight sets to reigning Roland Garros champion Carlos Alcaraz.He was in fine form against Gasquet, saving three break points to serve out the first set before dominating the rest of the match on Court Philippe Chatrier.""I'm very happy to be in the third round,"" Sinner told the crowd after setting up a third-round meeting with Czech Jiri Lehecka.""Thank you for being very fair with me today, I know what was at stake... It's your (Gasquet's) moment. Congrats on an amazing career.""Djokovic, fresh off his 100th ATP title last weekend, got his tilt at a fourth French Open crown off to a solid start on Tuesday.The Serbian sixth seed will need to be on his guard against crafty Frenchman Corentin Moutet.""I don't know how many more Grand Slams I've got left in my body,"" Djokovic said after the opening round.Third seed Alexander Zverev bounced back from losing the first set in a 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 win over Dutchman Jesper de Jong.Quiz: Who's that IPL player?

RCB vs PBKS, IPL 2025, Qualifier 1: Quick singles from Mullanpur

IPL 2025: What went wrong for Lucknow Super Giants?

Paris: Court No.14 is a nondescript space in the otherwise scenic settings of Roland Garros. The stands around the court can hold about 800 spectators, not a daunting number if you discount partisan sentiment – fans rallying behind the home player, employing hardy decibel levels, chanting ‘ole` ole`’ under threatening skies.On Tuesday, 19-year-old Jakub Mensik turned to the Court 14 stands like a concert conductor, swaying to their notes, even lending them an ear after he took a two-sets-to-one lead against Frenchman Alexandre Muller, before wrapping up the first-round match in four sets. The Czech sealed it with a smile. On Wednesday, the world No.52 Quentin Halys, born in the northeastern suburb of Paris, some 20 kms from where he was playing his second-round match against Serbia’s Miomir Kecmanovic, used the energy of the crowd to lift him after he fell behind early in the match.Shouts of ‘Quentin’ clap-clap ‘Quentin’ carried across the grounds as every Kecmanovic error was celebrated with the same gusto as a winner from the home player. Halys, playing in a shade of rich red wine, fed off the crowd to power home in four sets. Novak Djokovic , the 24-time major winner, who doesn’t hesitate to call out crowds when he thinks they cross the line, was asked if he thought fans at the French Open had become worse over the years.The 38-year-old Serbian said it was logical for fans to celebrate the home player.“Let’s take all four Slams, anywhere you go, the local player is going to have the crowd on their side. It is expected,” he said. “It is true that here in Paris, compared to other Slams, people are louder, more passionate and give more support, more energy to their players. It's not the ideal environment to be playing in, but you have to be ready for it.”At each of tennis’ Grand Slam fortnights crowds are debated on. The question is always the same, which of the majors has the worst (read most disruptive) fandom? While there’s no escaping the loud chants at Roland Garros, with fans getting behind their players firmly, New York’s Arthur Ashe stadium with a near 24,000 capacity, holding approximately 9000 spectators more than the other three – Rod Laver Arena, Court Philippe Chatrier and Wimbledon’s Centre court --. maybe the hardest to negotiate for sheer volume.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Remember the 2018 and 2019 US Open finals that pit Naomi Osaka and Bianca Andreescu respectively against the game’s rockstar Serena Williams? It got so loud, it felt like someone was thumping on your ear drums.Djokovic, seeded six this time, plays gifted Frenchman Corentin Moutet in the second round on Thursday. “I would expect most people to cheer for the French player, it's not personal,” he said.Mensik, seeded 19, who idolizes Djokovic, walked onto court on Tuesday waving a page from the Serbian’s handbook of tough takes.“When they were shouting his name, I was trying to (imagine) they were shouting my name,” the teenager said. “Sometimes it was super difficult, but I did well. I was just repeating in my head that they are cheering for me.”The 26-year-old Moutet hoped the crowd would be a factor on Thursday against Djokovic in the second round.“I don't think that will be the only reason to beat Djokovic,” the left-hander said. “He has been through a lot of different crowds. He won so many Grand Slams. I don't think I can count (only) on this. If they support me, it's going to give me a lot of power. So I'm going to play with the crowd. The goal is to win because I don't want to stop my tournament in the second round.”It’s getting louder in Paris, and the competition hotter, atmosphere might just be the synonym for boisterous volume.","World No.52 Quentin Halys, born in the northeastern suburb of Paris, used the energy of the crowd to lift him after he fell behind early in the match.

YUKI-GALLOWAY, BOPANNA-PAVLASEK WIN

Paris: Carlos Alcaraz is not a creature of proclivity, rather the French Open ’s defending champion is instinctive. It’s the way he plays his tennis — feeling his way into a match, and dissecting the court — the way he lives his life.The 22-year-old, who arrived at Roland Garros wearing a scruffy look, beard and overgrown crop, played his first-round match flaunting the fatigued tint. On Wednesday, however, the second seed rocked a new look against Hungary’s Fabian Marozsan. Alcaraz, who flew his barber into Paris, was given a close crop, shaved sides and tapered back finish, a style that was met with mixed reviews on the net. The second seed chased down a mid-match fightback from the Hungarian to score a 6-1, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 win on Court Philippe Chatrier.Alcaraz, who is unafraid to ride the mood, said he was lucky that his barber Victor was free to fly into Paris. “(When we were) talking, (I asked that) he bring the materials to cut my hair,” Alcaraz said. “I think everybody saw my hair, my beard. I had to do something about it. I know people are not used to seeing me get a haircut during a (tournament), that’s why people were a little bit surprised, but I think that’s something normal.Meanwhile, on another rain-interrupted day at Roland Garros, seventh-seeded Casper Ruud, hampered by a left knee issue, went down 2-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-0 to Portugal’s Nuno Borges.India’s Yuki Bhambri and American Robert Galloway beat Dutchman Robin Haase and German Hendrik Jebens 6-3, 6-7 (8-10), 6-3 in 2 hr and 12 min in the first round of the men’s doubles. Next up are the 7th seeds — Croatia’s Nikola Mektic and Kiwi Michael Venus. Rohan Bopanna and Czech Adam Pavlasek put out Americans Robert Cash and J Tracy 7-6 (8-6), 5-7, 6-1.Rithvik Bollipalli and Colombia’s Nicolas Barrientos fell 0-6, 2-6 to Briton Jacob Fearnley and Canada’s Gabriel Diallo.","Second seed Carlos Alcaraz beats Fabian Marozsan 6-1, 4-6, 6- 1,6-2.

Poll Will Iga Swiatek achieve her goal of winning a fourth consecutive French Open title? Yes, she will No, she won't

eigning champion Carlos Alcaraz overcame a minor blip to reach the French Open third round on Wednesday as women's title rivals Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka made short work of their opponents.Second seed Alcaraz came through 6-1, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 against Hungarian Fabian Marozsan to earn his 17th win in 18 matches on clay this season.""Second set, he started to play better and he didn't miss a lot so it was a little bit difficult to deal with his game,"" said Alcaraz.""I'm really happy I stayed strong and refreshed myself. In the third set, I started to play better and better which helped me have a really good last two sets.""Alcaraz, a four-time Grand Slam winner, goes on to face Bosnian journeyman Damir Dzumhur for a place in the last 16.In the women's draw, Swiatek continued her bid for a fourth straight Roland Garros crown as she outclassed fellow former US Open champion Emma Raducanu.The Pole beat Raducanu 6-1, 6-2 to make it five wins in as many meetings with the Briton. She racked up her 23rd consecutive victory at Roland Garros to improve her career record at the tournament to 37-2.Swiatek is bidding to become the first woman to win four consecutive French Open titles since Suzanne Lenglen 102 years ago.The 23-year-old arrived in Paris under a slight cloud, having not reached a WTA final since lifting the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen last year, but has made serene progress through the first two rounds.""Honestly, I just love playing here. This place inspires me and that makes me work harder,"" said Swiatek, who also captured the trophy as a teenager in 2020.The fifth seed will play Romania's Jaqueline Cristian for a place in the last 16.Swiatek's slide down the rankings has left her in the same half of the draw as world number one Sabalenka, last year's runner-up Jasmine Paolini and Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen.Sabalenka shook off a sluggish start to blow past Switzerland's Jil Teichmann.After dropping serve early in the first set, Sabalenka won 11 of the final 12 games to power to a 6-3, 6-1 win.""It doesn't matter what the scoreboard says, she really made me work for every point,"" said Sabalenka, who has conceded just five games through two rounds.The Belarusian has never reached the French Open final and is hoping to banish the memories of a painful quarter-final loss to Mirra Andreeva in 2024.Paolini moved into the third round as she brushed aside Ajla Tomljanovic 6-3, 6-3 to stretch her winning streak to eight matches following her triumph at the Italian Open.The fourth seed from Italy advances to play Ukraine's Yuliia Starodubtseva.Zheng punched her ticket to the last 32 with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Colombia's Emiliana Arango.The Chinese star faces another Grand Slam debutant in the next round, 18-year-old Victoria Mboko of Canada.Other seeds to progress included former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina, Elina Svitolina and Amanda Anisimova.Jelena Ostapenko, the 2017 French Open winner, rallied to win in three sets, but Russian 11th seed Diana Shnaider lost to Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska.Twice former French Open runner-up Casper Ruud was the biggest casualty on Wednesday, crashing out in four sets to Portugal's Nuno Borges.Seventh seed Ruud won the first set against world number 41 Borges but was hampered by a knee injury as he slumped to a 2-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-0 defeat.""I actually felt it quite early in the first set,"" said Ruud, uncertain whether he would be fit for Wimbledon. ""It's hopefully nothing too serious.""There were no such problems for in-form Italian eighth seed Lorenzo Musetti, who raced past Colombian lucky loser Daniel Elahi Galan 6-4, 6-0, 6-4.Musetti has reached at least the semi-finals in all three Masters 1000 events on clay in 2025. He will next play Argentina's Mariano Navone.Stefanos Tsitsipas, the 20th seed, suffered his earliest French Open exit in seven years as the 2021 runner-up lost in four sets to Matteo Gigante.The Italian qualifier goes through to face Ben Shelton, who received a walkover as Hugo Gaston pulled out with an injury.Denmark's Holger Rune, the only man to beat Alcaraz on clay this year in the Barcelona final, beat American wild card Emilio Nava 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 in the night match.",Second seed Carlos Alcaraz beats Fabian Marozsan to reach French Open third round.

In all sports, there are advantages to being at home. At the French Open tennis tournament, being a visitor playing against a French player can feel as though the whole world is against you.The crowds don't just cheer. They boo, they whistle, they make noise between serves, they hurl insults - and, at least once, even gum - at the locals' opponents. That sort of behaviour is why the tournament organisers banned alcohol from the stands last year, a policy still in place.Some of the non-French athletes who deal with that sort of negativity in Paris, such as 19-year-old Jakub Mensik of the Czech Republic, who eliminated Alexandre Muller in front of a rowdy crowd at Court 14 on Tuesday, compare the high-intensity atmosphere to that of a soccer game.Others choose stronger terms.One player says French Open fans can be 'disgusting' ""Disgusting. Worst experience of my life,"" was what Nicolas Jarry of Chile said this week when asked to think back to last year's rowdy loss at Court Simonne-Mathieu to France's Corentin Moutet, whose coach had implored the spectators to make life ""hell"" for Jarry after the two had a contentious meeting in Santiago earlier in the season.Jarry blamed that on Moutet, saying that everything was calmer during his loss Monday to another Frenchman, Arthur Fils, whom the Chilean called a ""good guy"" and a ""gentleman.""""It's a battle out there, you know. Sometimes, it's not just a battle with the player,"" said Novak Djokovic, who is scheduled to face the irrepressible Moutet in the second round Thursday.Expect an antagonistic atmosphere. Djokovic sure does. Roland-Garros spectators can be 'louder and more passionate' ""They're going to have the crowd on their side. It's nothing strange about it. It's expected,"" the 24-time Grand Slam champion said. ""But it is true that here in France and in Paris, comparing to other Slams, the people are louder and more passionate and just give more support, louder support, more energy to their player, which for some (opponents) can be annoying. It's not the kind of ideal environment you want to be playing in, but you have to be ready for it. ""So much for the supposed silence usually found in a tennis arena. It all raises questions about where the line between support and incivility lies.""We've stepped up security,"" tournament director Amelie Mauresmo, a former No. 1 player, said before this year's event, ""and given chair umpires greater power to intervene and report unacceptable behavior in the stands.""For Mensik on Tuesday, the jeers began every time he hit the ball during the warmup ahead of his 7-5, 6-7 (5), 7-5, 6-3 win over France's Muller. More arrived once play began, accompanying each of his 20 aces or just when he simply walked to check a ball mark - a routine part of clay-court tennis.After taking the third set, Mensik gave the boo birds a little bit back, waving his right index finger as if it were a baton conducting an orchestra, a move he learned from Djokovic.""Sometimes,"" Mensik said of the crowd, ""it is too far.""Still, there are those who shrug it all off.Some players say the rowdy crowds in Paris are just part of tennis ""That's part of tennis, especially here. My opponent had her fans here; I have mine in Belgium. It's normal,"" said Elise Mertens, the 24th-seeded Belgian who was a semifinalist at the 2018 Australian Open and lost Tuesday to Lois Boisson of France at Court 14. ""Fans were loud but not insulting. I didn't feel any particular hostility.""There are two sides to the loud backing French players receive.It ""makes you feel like you could reach for the stars,"" said the highest-ranked French woman, Varvara Gracheva, who acknowledged that support also can become a burden.She lost in the first round Tuesday.25 years since a Frenchwoman won the French Open, 42 since a man did It's been a quarter of a century since a woman representing the host nation won the singles title at the French Open ( Mary Pierce in 2000) and even longer since a man did ( Yannick Noah in 1983).""As French players, we're under pressure all the time when we play here"" said Moutet, currently ranked No. 73. ""When you lose, you 'suck.' When you win, you're 'King of the World.' So you have to try to ignore the pressure.""Nathan Fhima, an 18-year-old high school student from Paris, figured his compatriots needed his voice. So there he was this week at Roland-Garros, waving a blue-white-and-red French flag and screaming himself hoarse while skipping class to watch qualifying and first-round matches.""We have to push them, because not much will happen otherwise,"" he said after watching France's Diane Parry lose Monday. ""Maybe that noise will lift a homegrown champion to victory again. We have to believe.""","Crowds boo, whistle, hurl insults - and, at least once, even gum - at players. Tournament organisers banned alcohol from the stands last year, a policy still in place. Novak Djokovic: ""They're going to have the crowd on their side.

Poll Who do you think will win the third Test at Lord's? India England Draw

Two days after reaching London from Birmingham, India and England will march out at the Lord's cricket ground for the third Test starting today. While India have been training at the Home of Cricket for the last two days, the hosts had their first, and only, session before the game on July 9. In the first two fixtures, the pendulum has constantly swung from one team to another but India breaching the Edgbaston fortress gave them much-needed momentum ahead of the third game.The series is deliciously poised at 1-1 and a favourable result at Lord's will not only give the winning team the lead, but a very important confidence booster before the break takes over. A lot is at stake and in this high-pressure fixture, momentum will remain the key word and Shubman Gill-led India are riding that after the emphatic win last week. Even in favourable batting conditions, India not only outbatted the opposition but outskilled them with the ball and are currently high in spirits before the big one. India vice-captain Rishabh Pant was asked about the short turnaround and even the youngster reiterated that momentum helps in such situations.“Definitely it's a short turnaround, but like you said, when you have momentum on your side, you want that short turnaround,” said Pant on the eve of the third Test.“We are not thinking about it too much. It's good for us to have the momentum, but eventually you’ve got to play good cricket. This team will play better, and will win eventually,” he added.Pant himself has been juggling between batting, wicketkeeping, leadership and then some Wimbledon in the day and a gala dinner in the night. He was the life of the event hosted by Yuvraj Singh at a luxury hotel in London on July 8 and even loosened his purse strings for a bid of 17,000 pounds. And in a few hours' time, he sat for the pre-match press conference.It was the usual bit — some one-liners, plenty of laughs and the improved maturity. The clarity with which he spoke on the side's plans, team combination options, fresh reinforcement in the opposition and the stump mic chatter showed the boy has matured into a man. The members of Team India, who missed the first training, operated at full tilt and there was a batathon between the likes of KL Rahul Shubman Gill and Yashasvi Jaiswal as they just didn't stop batting.The nets were changed, attacks were shuffled and when everything was done, Ryan ten Doeschate took Gill, Sai Sudharsan and Karun Nair to the artificial turf wicket where he fed them underarm deliveries. After the proper hit, the trio was looking at getting their repetitions in and the underarm deliveries or the regular throwdowns from a shorter distance allow the batters to get a nice feel of their middle and exercise control.The scoreline reads 1-1 but even England know India were very close to sealing the game in Headingley. They capitalised on their chances in Birmingham and would now hope the Birmingham momentum continues in London, and is even carried forward to Manchester.","The third Test between India and England starts at Lord's on July 9.

Exclusive first look of green Lord's pitch: Intense chat of Gautam Gambhir with coaching staff

Poll Is batting depth becoming overly prioritized in Test cricket? Yes, it should be balanced with bowling No, it's essential for modern cricket

NEW DELHI: “We were tempted to play Kuldeep, but looking at the last match, our lower order didn't do well, so we decided to add some depth to the batting,” Shubman Gill had said, putting to rest all speculation around Kuldeep Yadav 's exclusion from the playing XI for the Edgbaston Test.Kuldeep, who returned to the Test format for the first time since the home series against New Zealand last October, missed the Border-Gavaskar Trophy due to injury. He was then handed a well-deserved call-up for the England tour. But he didn’t feature at Headingley and was benched again at Edgbaston.All Kuldeep did was carry drinks, relay head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s messages to players in the middle, participate in team huddles, and applaud every milestone his teammates achieved on the field.Of his 56 wickets in 13 Tests so far, 21 have come against England — a sign of how much he has troubled the English batters over the years.Kuldeep’s childhood coach, Kapil Dev Pandey, believes the result at Headingley might have been different had Kuldeep played, insisting that the wrist-spinner alongside a fiery Jasprit Bumrah would have formed a lethal combination in the match.""I just don’t understand why Kuldeep didn’t play. During the toss, Shubman Gill said that at Headingley, the lower order flopped, and we fell short of runs, so they included Washington Sundar for his batting in the second Test.But Kuldeep is a wrist-spinner who has troubled England and Australia overseas. Shouldn’t he have been there? Or should he now be sent back to domestic cricket and asked to open the batting? That’s unfair, right?"" Kapil Dev Pandey told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""Deep down, the management has doubts about him, which is why they haven’t played him yet. If you’re playing six batters, you might as well play eleven. But none of it matters if you don’t have a wicket-taker. As a coach, I’d say Kuldeep is essential for the country. Even if the batters score centuries, if we lose the match, it’s all in vain. Kuldeep should play at Lord's,"" he said.""Look at his Test record—he’s scored runs against Bangladesh and other decent teams. He’s got fifties in tournaments like the Duleep Trophy and Uttar Pradesh state matches. We need to think—if Kuldeep had been played and didn’t deliver, we could’ve moved on. But he should’ve been given at least one or two matches. England’s spinners are getting wickets here, and that should tell us something. Sure, Bumrah can take 2–3 quick wickets, but spinners will make the real difference. Had someone like Mohammad Shami been in the team, maybe we’d have had a better balance. Kuldeep and Bumrah would have been a lethal combination in the first Test,"" Pandey said while countering Gill's comment about adding depth in batting.On the other hand, former India left-arm spinner Sunil Joshi believes that batting depth has become crucial in modern cricket, and captains often prioritise it when selecting their playing XI. That, he says, could be the reason Washington Sundar — known for his ability to score vital runs — was preferred over Kuldeep.Joshi, who represented India in 15 Tests and 69 ODIs, also feels that England must be relieved not to have faced Kuldeep at all in the series so far.""In today’s game, a bowler needs to be three-dimensional. If he can chip in with 10–15 runs, it strengthens his case for being in the XI,"" Joshi told TimesofIndia.com.""Traditionally, England have struggled against wrist-spinners, so even I was hoping Kuldeep would play. But if the captain and team management are looking for a bowler who can contribute with the bat, then I understand why Washington Sundar got the nod. England must be very happy Kuldeep is not playing,"" he said.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? ""Speaking personally, I was a bowler, and batting was always a bonus for me—but it gave me opportunities. When there’s competition, and one player is a better batter, he gets the nod. That worked in my favour too. The spinners I played alongside—Murali Kartik, Nilesh Kulkarni, Gyanendra Pandey, Venkatapathy Raju, Rahul Sanghvi—all were good bowlers, but I got more opportunities because I was the better batter among them,"" the former cricketer said.With star pacer Jasprit Bumrah likely to return for the third Test at Lord's, Prasidh Krishna — who has struggled with his economy — might make way.The big question now is: will Shubman Gill finally include Kuldeep Yadav in the playing XI, or opt for extra batting depth once again, leaving the spinner to continue playing the waiting game? It will be interesting to see",Kuldeep Yadav returned to the Test format for the first time since the home series against New Zealand last October. He missed the Border-Gavaskar Trophy due to injury and was then handed a well-deserved call-up for the England tour. But he didn’t feature at Headingley and was benched again at Edgbaston.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122353208,imgsize-52388,width-400,resizemode-4/122353208.jpg"

India’s wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant is on the verge of scripting history in the longest format. With 86 sixes from just 45 Test matches, Pant now needs just five more to surpass Virender Sehwag ’s long-standing record of 91 sixes — the most by an Indian in Test cricket.What makes Pant’s feat even more astonishing is the pace at which he’s climbed the list. Sehwag took 104 Tests to hit 91 sixes, while Rohit Sharma , currently second with 88 sixes, has played 67 matches. Pant, in comparison, has got there in nearly half the games. With his natural attacking flair and fearless approach, the southpaw could well become India’s most prolific six-hitter in Test history during the upcoming third Test against England at Lord’s.The third match of the five-Test series for the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy begins this Thursday at the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground. The series is tied 1-1, with England winning the opener at Headingley and India bouncing back with a dominant 336-run win at Edgbaston — their first-ever Test victory at the venue.Conditions at Lord’s traditionally favour seamers, and the return of Jasprit Bumrah strengthens India’s attack. England have confirmed the selection of Jofra Archer , adding further firepower to a match already packed with anticipation.Rishabh Pant has looked in sublime touch throughout the series so far. With twin centuries in the first Test at Headingley and a counter-attacking fifty in the second Test at Edgbaston, the Indian vice-captain has shown he is at the peak of his powers.As India prepares for the all-important third Test at Lord’s, all eyes will be on Pant, not just for his match-defining potential, but also to see if he can etch his name in the history books by reaching this major milestone.

Poll How do you assess Gukesh D's performance at Norway Chess? Excellent Good Average Below Expectations

Gukesh D, who became the youngest world chess champion in history by defeating Ding Liren last December, has experienced a mixed journey in recent months. In his first tournament as world champion at Tata Steel chess in Wijk aan Zee, he nearly clinched victory before losing to Praggnanandhaa in a tie-break.His performance then declined in several Freestyle Chess events. At the Weissenhaus leg of the Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Tour, he struggled with zero wins, 11 draws, and six defeats. He continued to face challenges at the Paris leg and the Superbet Chess Classic Romania in Bucharest, where he secured just one win, six draws, and two defeats.However, Gukesh made a strong comeback at Norway Chess. He achieved his first classical victory over world number one Magnus Carlsen , which led to Carlsen's notable fist-smashing reaction. He also secured his first classical win over fellow Indian player Arjun Erigaisi. He remained close to Carlsen throughout the tournament, finishing third overall. Viswanathan Anand , a five-time world champion and Gukesh's mentor, has been closely monitoring his progress. When asked about Gukesh's recent performance at Norway Chess, Anand upgraded his assessment.""I think I will go up to B.He deserved a D, but he got a lot of answers correct somehow (at Norway Chess). So that's a B. Given that he survived and based on his points, I would give him a B,"" he told Chess.com.Before Norway Chess, Anand had given Gukesh a lower grade in his six-month assessment.""I think I would say only 'D minus', but Wijk aan Zee is pulling him to 'D plus' maybe or 'C minus',"" he had said.""He played extremely well (at Wijk aan Zee). Kind of rebound effect. I mean, you always have this fear that after the world championship, you suddenly have some emptiness. But in fact, for him, the first event was extremely successful. The rest of the year has been much more discreet, which is also maybe normal. Everybody treats him differently. He's finding his way. What would I put on a report card? I think 'needs further improvement' is kind of obvious; 'Must work harder'… something like that. He's still very strong and he just needs to find the right connections again.""In a later interview, Anand discussed Gukesh's performance at Norway Chess, noting areas for improvement.""At Norway Chess, Gukesh made a lot of questionable decisions in his moves and not in time trouble. He did it in the earlier phase of the game. Quite some people criticized that and I think the criticism is fair. Some of it at least,"" the five-time world champion added.""The two games he won with Magnus and Arjun are really the questionable ones. I'll grant you all that. But then let me turn the same question: How many people in the world can beat Arjun and Magnus from these positions? There are many things to criticize about his play. He was under the same time pressure as them. Second, if Hikaru or Magnus had escaped from some of these positions, we'd just say, 'But they're very strong.' Same logic has to apply here.""I'm sort of conflicted. On the one hand, I feel that we can't just say he played a great tournament because he finished on 50%. Also, the fact that you have such defensive skills doesn't mean you should be depending on them all the time. For instance, most countries have armies in order not to use them all the time. You don't want to depend too much on these skills. But you have to say he was very resourceful.""","Gukesh D became the youngest world chess champion in history by defeating Ding Liren last December.

Paris Saint-Germain delivered a commanding performance in their Club World Cup semi-final match against Real Madrid, securing a 4-0 victory at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford on July 10, 2025. Fabian Ruiz scored twice, while Ousmane Dembele and Goncalo Ramos added goals to set up a final clash with Chelsea, as PSG continues their pursuit of adding to their successful season following their French title and UEFA Champions League victories.The match saw PSG take early control with two quick goals in the opening nine minutes through Ruiz and Dembele, silencing the majority of the 77,542 spectators supporting Real Madrid.Ruiz netted his second before halftime, and Ramos sealed the victory with a late fourth goal for Luis Enrique's side.""We are in a special season, a special moment, and we deserved to win,"" Luis Enrique told broadcaster DAZN. ""We are going to try, one more step against a good team like Chelsea. They did great, they performed the whole competition and now it is time for us to prepare for that... we want to make history in our club, and then take some holidays.""The defeat was particularly significant for Real Madrid, who had hoped to add the first 32-team Club World Cup to their record of 15 European Cup victories.""We were not good enough today,"" said Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso. ""We are not the first ones to lose to them but we have a lot of different things to improve.""Former PSG star Kylian Mbappe, now with Real Madrid, struggled to make an impact in his first match against his former club since his departure last year.PSG managed the impressive victory despite missing suspended center-back Willian Pacho, with Lucas Beraldo effectively filling the defensive role.Real Madrid faced their own challenges, playing without suspended defender Dean Huijsen and missing Trent Alexander-Arnold.The match began with PSG goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois making two impressive saves in the first five minutes, denying both Ruiz and Nuno Mendes.PSG's opening goal came in the sixth minute when Dembele capitalized on poor defending by Raul Asencio, with Ruiz converting after Courtois saved the initial attempt.The second goal followed quickly as Antonio Rudiger miscontrolled a pass from Jude Bellingham, allowing Dembele to score with a low finish.PSG's third goal demonstrated their dominance, with Achraf Hakimi setting up Ruiz following a sequence of possession that started with a saved Mbappe shot.Real Madrid's attack, featuring Mbappe, Vinicius Junior, and Gonzalo Garcia, failed to threaten PSG's defense throughout the match.The Spanish side's struggles led to Alonso substituting both Bellingham and Vinicius just after the hour mark.Ramos completed the scoring in the 87th minute, controlling a pass from substitute Bradley Barcola before finding the net.The victory continues PSG's impressive run in the tournament, following their 5-0 win against Inter Milan in the European Cup final and a four-goal victory over Atletico Madrid earlier in the Club World Cup.PSG will now face Chelsea in the final on Sunday, with the opportunity to add another trophy to their remarkable season.The French champions displayed their attacking prowess throughout the match, with Dembele particularly impressive, adding to his impressive tally of 35 goals since August.The result positions PSG one game away from completing an unprecedented season of success, having already secured domestic and European honors.","Paris Saint-Germain beat Real Madrid 4-0 in their Club World Cup semi-final.

Indian cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar celebrates his 76th birthday today. Widely regarded as one of the finest batters to ever play the game, Gavaskar's achievements laid the foundation for India's rise in world cricket.The former India captain played 233 international matches and scored 13,214 runs, including 35 centuries. He became the first player in history to reach 10,000 runs in Test cricket, setting a benchmark for future generations. His consistency and courage against the world's best fast bowlers earned him global respect.Gavaskar announced his arrival with a stunning debut Test series against the West Indies in 1971, scoring 774 runs. That remains the most runs ever scored by a batter in their debut Test series. He also holds the record for the most Test centuries against West Indies, with 13 tons.The Mumbai-born batter was known for his solid technique and calm presence at the crease. He is the only player to have scored a double century in each of the four innings of a Test match, showing his adaptability in all conditions. In 1980, he was named one of Wisden’s Cricketers of the Year.In 1983, Gavaskar was a member of the Indian team that lifted the World Cup at Lord’s. While his numbers are celebrated, his true legacy lies in the belief he gave to a cricket-loving nation that they could stand tall against the best.On his 76th birthday, cricket fans and former players alike are paying tribute to the man who changed Indian cricket forever.","Gavaskar played 233 international matches and scored 13,214 runs, including 35 centuries.

Poll Should players prioritize representing Mumbai over playing in the IPL? Yes, representing Mumbai should come first No, IPL is the main focus Both are equally important

: Coming down heavily on the tendency of certain India players whom he feels are more interested to play in the IPL these days than for Mumbai, former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar on Wednesday asked Mumbai chief selector Sanjay Patil to pick only those players who take pride in playing for Mumbai.""Last season, our top-order batters weren't doing well. (Lower-order batters) Shardul Thakur and Tanush Kotian were rescuing us in almost all the games. I think there were a couple of Test players who were not interested in playing (for Mumbai). I told Sanjay (Patil, Mumbai chief selector): 'Ask those who aren't interested to play for Mumbai to go home. Take guys who take pride in performance, in winning matches and take pride in representing Mumbai. ' Those who are not interested, those who feel that 'I can probably play in the IPL' Please don't play for Mumbai,"" Vengsarkar thundered, while speaking to all the Mumbai teams at the official launch of the Mumbai Cricket Association's Cricketing Season 2025-26, at the MCA Sharad Pawar Indoor Cricket Academy and Recreation Centre, BKC.Present on the occasion were former India women's team captain Diana Edulji (MCA's women's cricket advisor), ex-India pacer Raju Kulkarni (Cricket Improvement Committee chairman), MCA president Ajinkya Naik, all the Mumbai teams' coaches and selectors, and Apex Council members.The 116-Test veteran, who is currently the MCA's cricket advisor, also slammed another trend that he has noticed-that of batters going for big shots deliberately in Under-19 & Under-23 BCCI tournaments to impress IPL talent scouts. ""I've seen that some of the Under-23 & Under-19 players, when they see IPL talent scouts at their matches, they try to play big shots and get out. That shouldn't happen. It's important that the player plays as per the requirements of the Mumbai team and as per the format of the game,"" Vengsarkar pointed out.Vengsarkar urged the youngsters to avoid social media while playing matches and ""take pride"" in playing for Mumbai rather than only bothering about the IPL. ""Everybody thinks that the IPL is the only thing, the right platform to show your talent. See, the important thing is that you are playing for Mumbai. You are expected to do well for Mumbai. Take pride in winning matches for Mumbai. It's very, very important. Keep social media, messages, phones aside for a while (during matches). Stay focused. Be passionate about your own performance and how you can win matches because when I was the selector, I used to see who would win the match from a difficult position. If we were, for example, 80 for five, and you need 300 runs. Who will win the match for me from there? This is precisely why I picked Virat Kohli when I was the India chief selector,"" he said.""You must look to win the semifinals and finals, the big games. You are all outstanding cricketers who have a bright future. You must stay focused and passionate about the game,"" Vengsarkar concluded in his speech.Meanwhile, MCA president Ajinkya Naik advised Mumbai's young cricketers to be more loyal to their clubs. ""Unfortunately, there's no concept of club loyalty anymore, unlike the earlier times. Players think that they can play for Mumbai only if they represent clubs that belong to the top administrators or selectors in local cricket. However, you can't play for Mumbai for a long time with that approach. You can only play for Mumbai on the basis of your performance. That's the sole criteria. There's no concept of friendship or favours here. You all have been picked for the various teams of Mumbai based on your performance. Loyalty is important. You should take pride in playing for your club and Mumbai and representing the MCA,"" Naik asserted.",Dilip Vengsarkar says Mumbai players are more interested in playing in IPL than playing for Mumbai.

What made the meeting even more special was that both girls wore Rajasthan Royals ’ pink jerseys—Vaibhav’s IPL team.The two girls got to meet their idol, took pictures with him, and cheered passionately for both him and the Indian team.Meanwhile, India’s Under-19 team ended their one-day campaign in England on a disappointing note, suffering a seven-wicket defeat in the fifth and final Youth ODI on Monday.Despite the loss, Vaibhav remained in the spotlight. He scored a gritty 33, keeping fans engaged after his earlier record-breaking century in the series.With the series already sealed 3-1 after a dominant 55-run win in the fourth ODI, India opted to rest some key players and shuffle the lineup.However, their decision to bat first in Worcester didn’t pay off.Captain Ayush Mhatre (1) and Vihaan Malhotra (1) were dismissed cheaply, leaving India reeling at 9 for 2 in the opening overs.Vaibhav then stepped up with a composed 33 off 42 balls, hitting three fours and two sixes. He put together a crucial 51-run partnership with Rahul Kumar (21) to steady the innings. But his dismissal—caught by Alex Green off Sebastian Morgan while trying to accelerate—triggered a collapse.The middle order failed to capitalise. Harvnash Pangalia (24), Kanishk Chauhan (24), and Deepesh Devendran (0) couldn’t convert their starts.RS Ambrish was the lone standout in the latter half of the innings, scoring a defiant 66 off 81 balls with six boundaries to help India reach a modest 210/9 in their 50 overs.England made the chase look easy. Ben Mayes led from the front with an unbeaten 82, while BJ Dawkins smashed 66 and captain Thomas Rew chipped in with a quick 49 not out off just 37 balls.The hosts chased down the target in just 31.1 overs, winning with 113 balls to spare. Naman Pushpak was the only Indian bowler to strike twice, but England’s dominance ensured they ended the series on a high.","Vaibhav Suryavanshi is the star of India's Under-19 ODI series win over England.

As India gears up for the pivotal third Test at Lord’s, Rishabh Pant has offered insights into his mindset and preparation, particularly ahead of a much-anticipated face-off with returning England pacer Jofra Archer Pant, who has played a key role for India in the series so far, stressed the importance of mental discipline at the crease. A firm believer in self-talk, the wicketkeeper-batter revealed how this method has stayed with him since his early cricketing days.""Generally the idea is to keep talking to yourself as a batsman,"" Pant told reporters. ""For me as a batsman, I think I'm doing the same thing that I used to do as a kid. Keep telling myself. Because my coach used to tell me, keep talking to you. For me, it was late Tarak Sinha Sir who taught me things. I still try to do the same thing always.""With Jofra Archer set to return to England’s Test XI after a prolonged injury layoff, Pant welcomed the challenge , but stessed that his own approach won’t change.""Personally, whenever I step on the field, I always enjoy my cricket and try to give my 200%,"" Pant said. ""Not particularly about any individual.Just being on the field, yes, it's going to be a good contest always because he's also coming back after a long break. I'm happy he's back.""Pant also spoke about India’s team combination, noting that the call between a three- or four-pronged pace attack will hinge on final pitch conditions.""For me personally, I try to have a very clear mindset when I'm batting. Just playing one ball at a time, that is something which has really helped me,"" he said.A win for Inida at Lord's will see the visitors take a 2-1 lead into the series heading into the penultimate Test.",Rishabh Pant offers insights into his mindset and preparation ahead of the third Test at Lord's.

India take on England in the 3rd Test at Lord's starting Thursday. With the series level at 1-1 and a high-stakes clash just over the horizon, players from both camps are in the final stages of preparation. Following the Edgbaston Test and ahead of the match at Lord's, several cricket stars made appearances at Wimbledon , including the likes of power couple Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma, former India head coach Ravi Shastri and Deepak Chahar & wife Jaya Bhardwaj.In a surprise appearance, India's pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah has also marked his presence at the Grand Slam tournament. A picture of the pacer alongside his wife Sanjana Ganesan, posted on the official Instagram handle of Wimbledon immediately went viral. Bumrah, who was rested for the 2nd Test, is in contention to play at Lord's.Bumrah's appearance at SW19 comes in the wake of another familiar name at the event, with teammate and India vice-captain Rishabh Pant, who stunned in a dapper navy blue suit. Unlike the precedent set by Kohli, Shastri, Pant and Chahar, Bumrah opted not to wear a suit. The 31-year-old donned a sleek white shirt and blue jeans while his wife complemented his style with an elegant light brown coat.Besides Bumrah, India T20I captain and Bumrah's Mumbai Indians teammate Suryakumar Yadav also made an appearance at the tournament.

How Jasprit Bumrah is preparing for Lord's Test - batting, bowling and lot of jokes!

Former India wicketkeeper-batter Deep Dasgupta believes Team India must maintain the same level of consistency in both batting and bowling as they did in the second Test if they are to take the lead in the series when they face England in the third Test at Lord’s starting Thursday.With the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy currently locked at 1-1, the upcoming clash at the iconic London venue promises to be a decisive encounter. India head into the contest with momentum on their side, following a commanding 336-run victory at Edgbaston.“There are three things India must do to win the Lord’s Test. First and foremost — consistency. Yes, they have won the last match and levelled the series, but it is far from over. There are still three Tests to go. The level of consistency we saw in both, batting and bowling, during the second Test – that needs to be repeated,” Dasgupta said while speaking on JioHotstar.With just three days separating the second and third Tests, Dasgupta underlined the critical need for rest and recovery, particularly for India’s pace attack and captain Shubman Gill , who played two marathon knocks — 269 and 161 — at Edgbaston.""The second thing is to rest properly, because there isn’t much time between the two Test matches. Recovery is very important — especially for the fast bowlers, and for captain Shubman Gill, who has played two very long innings,"" he noted.He also highlighted the challenge of adapting to the Lord’s slope — a unique feature of the venue that runs from the Pavilion End to the Nursery End, with a gradient of around 2.5 meters.“The third thing that is very important at Lord’s is the slope. This is a slightly inexperienced side, and many players will be playing at Lord’s for the first time. For both, the batters and the bowlers, understanding and adjusting to the slope is going to be a big challenge. Let’s hope they find answers to all the challenges and questions,"" Dasgupta added.","India face England in the third Test at Lord's starting Thursday.

Poll Is Akash Deep's performance enough to secure his spot in the team? Yes, he is in top form No, he should be rested

As India gear up for the third Test against England at Lord’s, former pacer Varun Aaron believes the team’s bowling combination remains in sharp focus, with Akash Deep at the heart of it. In Aaron’s words, the 28-year-old is near 'undroppable' after his standout showing at Edgbaston.Following India’s thumping 336-run win to level the series 1-1, captain Shubman Gill confirmed that pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah will return for the Lord’s Test. That puts the spotlight on team balance, with Aaron suggesting that all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy could be the one to make way.“Jasprit Bumrah is definitely going to come in. Now, the only question is whether India will go with four fast bowlers or stick to three. Nitish Kumar Reddy is most likely to be rested. He is expected to make way for another player, as India could not fully utilise his skillset in the previous match,” Aaron said on JioHotstar, as quoted by IANS.“I also felt he could have contributed a little more on the field. He is a quality player, no doubt, but he might have to wait a bit longer for a consistent run.With both the batting and bowling departments firing well, India have the flexibility to either bring in an extra batter or an extra bowler based on the conditions,” he added.But it’s Akash Deep who Aaron believes has sealed his place. The pacer picked up an impressive ten-wicket haul in the Edgbaston Test, showcasing impressive control and movement.“As for Akash Deep, you simply cannot leave him out. He is currently among the top three bowlers in the world in terms of new-ball averages. Much like Jasprit Bumrah, he can bowl whenever and wherever you need him to,” Aaron emphasised.He further pointed out that Mohammed Siraj would likely serve as the first-change bowler, praising his current rhythm with the Dukes ball, while hailing India’s bowling unit as a serious threat to England going into the Lord’s Test.",Varun Aaron believes Akash Deep is near 'undroppable' after his standout showing at Edgbaston.

New signing Joao Pedro scored twice on his first start as Chelsea eased to a 2-0 win over Fluminense on Tuesday to seal a spot in the final of the Club World Cup.The Brazilian striker opened the scoring in lethal fashion in the 18th minute of the last-four clash at the MetLife Stadium and struck again shortly before the hour mark as Chelsea set up a showdown with either Real Madrid or Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday's final.Signed from Brighton and Hove Albion last week for a reported £60 million ($79 million), the 23-year-old cut short a holiday and made his debut off the bench in the quarter-final win over Palmeiras.He was then given his first Chelsea start up front here in place of the suspended Liam Delap.Joao Pedro refused to celebrate after either goal against the club with whom he started his career and made 36 top-team appearances before moving to England with Watford in 2020.The result ends Fluminense's impressive run at the tournament after the 2023 Copa Libertadores winners held Borussia Dortmund in the group stage, beat Inter Milan in the last 16 and knocked out Manchester City's conquerors Al-Hilal in the quarter-finals.With their exit go the prospects of a South American winner of the first 32-team Club World Cup, with Chelsea claiming back-to-back victories against Brazilian opposition to reach the final.As always seemed most likely, the trophy will be claimed by one of Europe's superpowers, with the final now guaranteed to be between two of the last five winners of the UEFA Champions League.""It is a great achievement.

WATCH:

Real Madrid held off a late Borussia Dortmund surge to clinch a 3-2 win and book their place in the semi-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup, where they will face European champions Paris Saint-Germain. The match, played under sweltering heat at the MetLife Stadium near New York City, saw Gonzalo Garcia and Kylian Mbappe steal the show for the Spanish giants.Gonzalo Garcia, 21, opened the scoring in the 10th minute, slotting home his fourth goal of the tournament after an inch-perfect cross from Arda Guler. Ten minutes later, full-back Fran Garcia doubled the lead, finishing off a flowing move that included a cutback from Trent Alexander-Arnold. Real Madrid dominated the opening stages, stifling Dortmund’s rhythm and forcing them to chase shadows.Coach Xabi Alonso praised his team’s display but acknowledged the chaotic finish: “Everything was going under control… but the last 10 minutes were kind of crazy. Overall, a good 80 minutes and the last 10 minutes to improve.”Indeed, Dortmund mounted a dramatic late comeback.Maximilian Beier fired in from a loose clearance in the 93rd minute to make it 2-1. But Real’s response was emphatic — Mbappe, who came off the bench in the second half, produced a sensational overhead kick to restore the two-goal cushion.Mbappe, still yet to start in the tournament due to recent illness, now has his first goal of the Club World Cup and 44th of the season. ""It will be a great challenge for us to face PSG, but let's take positives from today and move on for the next one,"" said Alonso ahead of the semi-final showdown.There was still more drama to come, as Dean Huijsen was sent off for bringing down Serhou Guirassy, who converted the resulting penalty to bring Dortmund back within a goal.Despite the scare, Real held on, much to the delight of the 76,611 fans in attendance — a repeat of the 2024 Champions League final, but with far more twists.Dortmund coach Niko Kovac reflected, “It is a deserved win for Real Madrid. We showed our qualities and it is not a failure if you go home after a defeat against them.”","Real Madrid beat Borussia Dortmund 3-2 to reach the FIFA Club World Cup semi- finals.

Work and commitment

A late own-goal by goalkeeper Weverton took Chelsea through to the Club World Cup semi-finals on Friday as the Premier League side edged Palmeiras of Brazil 2-1 in a last-eight tie that had been lit up by a moment of magic from young star Estevao Willian.The teenage Brazil forward, who will join Chelsea after the tournament, was eager to impress his future employers and his brilliant 53rd-minute finish cancelled out Cole Palmer's opener in Philadelphia.But a deflected Malo Gusto cross went in off Palmeiras 'keeper Weverton in the 83rd minute to take Chelsea through to a semi-final showdown with another Brazilian side in Fluminense.""In the first half we were in control of the game and could have scored more than one goal,"" said Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca, dismissing suggestions his team had been fortunate.""They started the second half better than us and the dynamic of the game changed, but then in the last 25 minutes we were in control again and I think we deserved to win without being lucky.""The scoreline was a repeat of Chelsea's victory when the teams met in the final of the Club World Cup under the tournament's old guise in 2022.""Overall Chelsea was better. They have better players and a better coach,"" admitted Palmeiras coach Abel Ferreira.""They were lucky with the way they scored the second goal but it can happen in football and we need to accept it and move on.""Chelsea will now be fancied to go on and reach the final, with Fluminense standing in their way in the last four at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Tuesday.If not everyone has yet been won over by the tournament, the intensity levels on the pitch are rising as it reaches the business end and there was a big-game atmosphere in Philadelphia.Lincoln Financial Field was almost sold out, with 65,782 fans in attendance despite much of the city having emptied out for the July 4 holiday and long weekend.This game played out to a backdrop of Independence Day fireworks lighting up the sky over the nearby Delaware River, but there were fireworks on the pitch too.Chelsea lit the spark first, going ahead in the 16th minute thanks to a moment of class from England international Palmer.After drifting into a pocket of space just outside the Palmeiras box, Palmer controlled a Trevoh Chalobah pass on the half-turn, carried on into the area and dispatched a low shot past Weverton.It was the ideal start for Chelsea, who lost to Flamengo when they last faced Brazilian opposition in the same stadium during the group stage.Maresca added extra Brazilian flavour to the occasion by handing a first start to young midfielder Andrey Santos.With Moises Caicedo suspended, Santos occupied the holding midfield role for Chelsea while Pedro Neto lined up on the right wing, choosing to play despite having to come to terms with the tragic death of his Portugal teammate Diogo Jota on Thursday.Playing on the right wing for Palmeiras was Estevao, the 18-year-old Brazil prodigy set to join Chelsea in a big-money transfer agreed over a year ago.He knew this could be his last game for the Sao Paulo side, and Chelsea probably should have been two ahead before the interval only for Christopher Nkunku to blaze over after being teed up by Palmer.Instead Palmeiras equalised eight minutes into the second half, with Estevao the inevitable scorer.Positioned inside the Chelsea box to the right, Estevao controlled a pass by Richard Rios and took a touch to get in front of Levi Colwill, another to steady himself, and then surprised goalkeeper Robert Sanchez with an early shot that went in off the bar.Chelsea responded by sending on new signing Joao Pedro for his debut, the Brazilian becoming the 27th player used by Maresca during the tournament.The Blues pushed in search of a second goal but extra time was looking likely when the Premier League side grabbed a scrappy winner with seven minutes of the 90 to play.Following a corner played short, Enzo Fernandez found Malo Gusto and his attempted low centre from the left side of the box deflected off the toe of Agustin Giay to surprise Weverton, with the ball striking him on its way in.Substitute Hercules struck a 70th-minute winner as Brazil's Fluminense defeated Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal 2-1 on Friday to reach the semi-finals of the Club World Cup.A fine left-foot finish from Matheus Martinelli had put the Rio club ahead in the 40th minute but Al Hilal's Brazilian forward Marcos Leonardo levelled six minutes into the second half before Hercules stole the show to the delight of the vast majority of the 43,091 crowd.Al Hilal had pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament, beating Manchester City 4-3, to reach the last eight and Simone Inzaghi's side fought hard until the end to keep their adventure alive.They bow out of the tournament having been unbeaten through the group stage, including holding Real Madrid to a draw, and having truly made their mark on the world stage.There was a moment's silence before the kick-off in memory of Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota and his younger brother Andre Silva, who died in the early hours of Thursday after their car veered off a motorway in Spain and burst into flames.Al Hilal's line-up featured two of Jota's Portugal team-mates in Ruben Neves and Joao Cancelo.The first half was a tight and tactical affair with few chances until Martinelli opened the scoring when he picked the ball up from Gabriel Fuentes inside the box and span out to give himself space for a left-foot shot that rocketed past Yassine Bounou.Al Hilal went close to a quick response when Kalidou Koulibaly's header forced Fluminense's 44-year-old goalkeeper Fabio into a fine save.The Saudi side were awarded a penalty when Samuel Xavier was ruled to have brought down Marcos Leonardo in the box but Dutch referee Danny Makkelie was eventually sent to the monitor where he overturned his own decision after seeing there had been no contact between the two players.After going in at the break trailing by a goal, Al Hilal came out strongly for the second half and drew level when Koulibaly headed a Neves corner down to Marcos Leonardo who poked home.Al Hilal's Brazilian full back Renan Lodi had a let off when his poor backpass fell straight at the feet of German Cano but the Fluminense striker's attempt to round Bounou was denied by the smart work of the Moroccan keeper.But the outcome was settled with 20 minutes remaining when half-time sub Hercules saw a shot from distance blocked but from the loose ball Samuel headed the ball back to the forward who raced into the box and fired past Bounou to make it 2-1.Al Hilal produced a flurry of corners and some intense pressure in the final minutes as they desperately sought a way to keep their dream alive but the Brazilians were good value for their victory.""We didn’t have many chances but we made the most of them, the entire group worked and were committed,"" said Fluminense coach Renato Gaucho.""Our fans here in the USA and those in Brazil, they can be proud and I ask them to wear a jersey, in the mall, street, beach, wherever, wear that shirt – they should all be proud to wear that jersey,"" he said.The Fluminense coach was full of praise for the performance of his 40-year-old central defender Thiago Silva who ensured the Brazilians were able to withstand the second half pressure from Al Hilal.""Thiago Silva is huge for us, I worked with him 15 years ago, he is a coach on the pitch, very helpful and conveys calm and experience to the others. He is our captain and a leader and in hard matches like these against big clubs, its important to have people like him. He is key and fundamental,"" he said.Al Hilal coach Inzaghi said his side had been unfortunate to end on the losing side.""It has been a good World Cup for us but clearly we leave with a little bit of a bitter taste in our mouth because after what happened in that second half, we deserved much more,"" he said.""It was a tight match, decided by episodes, as happens in football. Fluminense are very well organised team that are having an excellent tournament,"" he added.",Chelsea beat Palmeiras 2-1 to reach the Club World Cup semi-finals in Philadelphia.

How the technology works

Can the visually impaired also enjoy the fun and thrill of a Formula E race? Yes, it’s now possible — thanks to a new initiative by Formula E and Google Cloud: an AI-powered audio race report. This initiative promotes inclusivity and makes motorsport more accessible for blind and visually impaired fans. Google Cloud will work with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) to conduct focus groups and user testing during upcoming race weekends in Berlin and London, with a full rollout planned for Formula E season 12.The project was unveiled by Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds at the Google Cloud Summit in London. It uses Google Cloud’s generative AI technology to create rich, descriptive audio summaries of every E-Prix race. These reports will offer fans a dynamic recap that captures the excitement and key moments of each race, available on demand shortly after the chequered flag.The initiative originated from a Google Cloud Hackathon held during the 2024 London E-Prix. It is being developed in close partnership with RNIB to ensure the final product meets the needs of visually impaired users.Sharing his enthusiasm about the collaboration, Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds said, “At Formula E, we believe the thrill of electric racing should be accessible to everyone. This innovative collaboration with Google Cloud is a fantastic example of how technology can be used for good—creating a brand-new way for blind and visually impaired fans to experience the drama and emotion of our sport. By working closely with the RNIB, we are ensuring this innovation is truly inclusive and fit for purpose, so that no fan is left behind. ”John Abel, Managing Director of Specialised Software at Google Cloud, added, “For too long, the visual nature of racing has been a barrier for fans who are blind or visually impaired. Google Cloud's AI technology will act as a digital storyteller, creating a vivid audio narrative that brings the speed, strategy, and excitement of Formula E to life. We are proud to work alongside a partner like Formula E that shares our passion for using innovation to break down barriers and connect people through shared experiences. ”Sonali Rai, RNIB’s Media, Culture and Immersive Technology Lead, also said, “Audio description transforms how blind and partially sighted motorsport fans can fully engage in enjoying the full racing spectacle—taking in the visceral sounds of cars on the track while feeling the passion of the crowd.”She continued, “RNIB has been working with Formula E and Google Cloud on this AI-powered podcast, which promises to give a full picture of the race in an accessible and engaging way for blind and partially sighted fans. Formula E’s commitment to working directly with the community to develop this technology is exactly the right approach. It sets a fantastic standard in inclusivity for other sports to follow and stay on track with new advances in innovation. ”The audio report is generated through a multi-stage process powered by Google Cloud's AI platform, Vertex AI. Google’s Chirp model accurately transcribes live race commentary. Google’s Gemini models analyze the transcribed commentary along with live timing data and other official race information.

Sebastien Buemi wins third spot on the podium in Jakarta



Sebastien Buemi’s performance in 2025 Formula E season

Coming as major good news for Envision Racing driver Sebastien Buemi, the removal of a time penalty from the last Jakarta race has landed him on the podium. Buemi is now officially promoted to third place, while Nico Mueller, who had originally celebrated a podium alongside Dan Ticktum and Edoardo Mortara at the Jakarta E-Prix, has been moved to fourth.The five-second penalty initially handed to Sebastien Buemi at the Jakarta E-Prix for contact with Mahindra Racing’s Edoardo Mortara was recently overturned following a FIA hearing. Due to the penalty, Buemi had finished eighth in Round 12 of the Jakarta race in June. However, the reversal has now reshaped the podium — much to Mueller’s disappointment.According to FormulaE.com, additional footage from Envision Racing's roll hoop camera, which was not available at the time the penalty was applied, was reviewed in detail. Buemi had received the penalty for an on-track collision with Mortara.The FIA stated: “The driver of Car 16 (Buemi) argued that the new element shows his overtaking manoeuvre was legitimate, that he was always in control of his car, and that when the slight contact occurred, he was fully alongside Car 48 (Mortara).”They further added: “The driver of Car 48 agreed with the assessment and mentioned he barely felt the contact.Upon careful consideration of the circumstances, the Stewards find that no single party bears whole or predominant responsibility for the collision. Therefore, the Stewards decide to reverse Decision 12. As a result, the penalty (i.e., five-second time penalty and one penalty point) on Car 16 is removed, and no further action will be taken in relation to this collision. ”With this update, Buemi moved to 10th in the Formula E Driver Standings with 63 points. In addition to his newly awarded Jakarta podium, he also has one win this season, in the Monaco E-Prix during Round 7.Also Read: Nico Mueller happy with Jakarta podium but adds, “It could have been even better with Jake” Buemi will now head to Berlin for Rounds 13 and 14 of the Formula E season.

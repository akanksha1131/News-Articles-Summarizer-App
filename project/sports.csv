However, the return of Abhishek Nayar will surely boost the struggling KKR outfit.Meanwhile, on the other hand, Titans under the leadership of Shubman Gill, have lost only twice this season and are currently placed top of the points table.Gujarat Titans bowling attack has been a major strength with pacer Prasidh Krishna leading their charge with 14 wickets at an average of 14.35 from seven games. Krishna's ability to outthink batters and vary his length have been the key, as seen in his recent spell against Lucknow Super Giants when he returned with a four-wicket haul. Left-arm spinner R Sai Kishore has taken 11 wickets and could relish the variable bounce and slow nature of Eden surface.The surface at the Eden Gardens has been questioned by the KKR players. Ahead of their must-win fixtures, two pitches have been prepared for this match. One has an extra layer of grass that has not been trimmed. The final decision on the surface will depend on the team's strategy, even as the KKR have conveyed their displeasure at not getting enough ""home advantage"".Quinton de Kock (wk), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane , Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Anrich Nortje, Vaibhav AroraVarun ChakravarthyGujarat Titans Predicted XI: Shubman Gill (c), B Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler (wk), Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Shahrukh Khan, Rashid Khan, R Sai Kishore, Mohammad Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant SharmaWashington SundarWhile the temperature will be warm and humidity high, there is a low chance of rain affecting the KKR vs GT match.

Why was Ambati Rayudu banned?

Former India opener Shikhar Dhawan playfully trolled Ambati Rayudu while doing Hindi commentary during the game between Punjab Kings and Royal Challengers Bengaluru.Dhawan and Rayudu had played together since their U-19 days. While reminiscing about those times, Dhawan blamed Rayudu for India's loss against Pakistan in the 2004 U-19 World Cup held in Dhaka, Bangladesh.""Ambati Rayudu was a big name in U-19 cricket. He was our captain in the U-19 World Cup, and he got banned there as well ahead of the semifinal, which cost us the match,"" Dhawan said.In Rayudu's absence, Dinesh Karthik led India in the semifinal, and they lost to Pakistan by five wickets.Batting first, India U-19 posted 169 runs. Robin Uthappa top-scored with 33 runs, while Dhawan only managed eight runs.In reply, Pakistan U-19 chased down the total in 44.5 overs. Pakistan was struggling at 83 for 5 at one stage, but Tariq Mahmood (45 not out) and Fawad Alam (43 not out) put together an unbeaten 88-run partnership for the sixth wicket.Pakistan went on to win the U-19 World Cup, defeating West Indies in the final.Ambati Rayudu, who was the captain of India U-19, missed the semifinal after being banned for one match for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct. Rayudu was reported by umpires Brian Jerling and Billy Doctrove under provision C2 of the ICC Code of Conduct at Level 2 for conduct that brought the game into disrepute.The charge related to excessive time-wasting in the opening overs of the second innings during India's final group match against Sri Lanka on February 26th. India bowled only eight overs in the first 50 minutes of the Sri Lanka innings.","Former India opener Shikhar Dhawan playfully trolled Ambati Rayudu while doing Hindi commentary during the game between Punjab Kings and Royal Challengers Bengaluru.

Digvesh Rathi leads the pack of uncapped bowlers

How has MS Dhoni performed as IPL's oldest uncapped player?

NEW DELHI: As the Indian Premier League 2025 crosses its halfway mark, it's not just the superstars who have made headlines.This season has witnessed an exciting surge of uncapped players stepping into the spotlight, proving their mettle in high-pressure situations.While legends like MS Dhoni, who entered the league as an uncapped player due to a rule change, continue to draw crowds, it's the lesser-known names: Digvesh Rathi, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, and Ashwani Kumar, among others, who’ve turned heads and started carving their own legacy.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Among the uncapped bowlers, Digvesh Rathi of Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) has arguably been the most consistent.In eight matches so far, the leggie has picked up nine wickets at an economy of 7.43, a commendable rate in today’s batting-dominant format.His best of 2/30 might not be headline-grabbing, but Rathi’s control and temperament under pressure, powered by his unorthodox bowling action, have added real depth to LSG’s bowling arsenal.Close on his heels is Kolkata Knight Riders ' Vaibhav Arora, whose eight wickets in just six matches have come at a strike rate of 16.12.QUIZ: Who's that IPL player? While his economy (9.11) suggests a bit of leakage, Arora’s knack for breakthroughs has made him invaluable.Mumbai Indians' Vignesh Puthur has been a revelation in fewer opportunities: six wickets in four matches at a superb average of 15.66.However, it’s Ashwani Kumar who provided one of the most eye-catching performances of the season. He notched a four-wicket haul in his maiden league appearance, becoming the first Indian to take four wickets on IPL debut.If MI use him smartly in the latter half, he could turn into a late-season X-factor.Meanwhile, some uncapped bowlers have struggled to adapt. Simarjeet Singh, Prince Yadav, and Yash Thakur have all gone for 10-plus runs an over, with high bowling averages and minimal impact.While these young guns show promise, the pressure of the IPL spotlight is clearly a tough crucible.Another name making waves is Punjab's Priyansh Arya, who smacked a blistering 103 against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in his fourth IPL start. Currently, he boasts a mind-boggling strike rate of over 200.With 254 runs, he’s played the aggressor’s role to perfection.Teammates Nehal Wadhera and Prabhsimran Singh have added substance to Punjab’s batting, with both showing improved shot selection and situational awareness.Abishek Porel (DC) and Amanjot Raghuvanshi (KKR) have been steady performers in the middle order, while Aniket Verma (SRH), with a strike rate of 187.05, has delivered explosive cameos that have turned matches.Asutosh Sharma has emerged as Delhi’s clutch finisher, striking at 178.94 with a cool head and a fearless blade in the death overs.However, not all uncapped batters have flourished.Naman Dhir, Ramandeep Singh, and Sameer Rizvi have had underwhelming runs, showing flashes of brilliance but lacking consistency.Even as these youngsters make their mark, MS Dhoni’s presence continues to be magnetic. Albeit, considering the 43-year-old -- who played over 500 matches for India -- qualifies as an uncapped player by a rule change, the comparisons are hardly like-for-like.On the face of it, the numbers paint a rosy picture. Batting precariously down the order, the former Indian skipper has scored 134 runs in 8 matches with a stunning strike rate of 152.27.Again, considering he's no ordinary 'uncapped' player, these are paltry returns for someone of his experience.As some of these names, such as Rathi, bring their names into a conversation for national team selection, if there's one certainty in IPL, it's that heroes can emerge from the unlikeliest corners, and maybe we can find a new one today?",Digvesh Rathi leads the pack of uncapped bowlers in IPL 2025. Ashwani Kumar is the first Indian to take four wickets on IPL debut. Priyansh Arya boasts a mind- boggling strike rate of over 200.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120454763,imgsize-53878,width-400,resizemode-4/MS-Dhoni-and-Digvesh-Rathi-BCCI-Photos.jpg"

After a string of low scores and rising questions about his fitness and future, the 37-year-old let his bat do the talking in the most emphatic way possible.","Mumbai Indians beat Chennai Super Kings by nine wickets at Wankhede.

Poll Do you believe a mentor's role is crucial for a team's success? Not really, players can manage on their own. Yes, absolutely!

In the buildup to the much-anticipated Indian Premier League clash between Gujarat Titans and Delhi Capitals at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday, a light-hearted exchange between KL Rahul and Delhi Capitals mentor Kevin Pietersen stole the spotlight — and the internet’s heart.The Delhi Capitals' social media team posted a seemingly innocent video of GT skipper Shubman Gill greeting Pietersen during practice. The two exchanged pleasantries before Pietersen, with his trademark charm, posed a rhetorical question: “Bro, what’s a mentor? No one knows what a mentor is. Can you tell me what a mentor is?”Just as Gill chuckled, KL Rahul — who was nearby, gearing up for the session — chimed in with a zinger that had everyone in splits.“Mentor is someone who goes to Maldives for two weeks mid-season,” Rahul quipped, sending Pietersen into a smile as others around joined the laughter.The Capitals’ admin didn’t miss the opportunity to ride the wave, captioning the clip: “Thanks, KL, now we know what a mentor does.”After the video went viral, Pietersen replied to Rahul through a social media post explaining the role of a 'mentor' in a funny way.""Mentor - The wise and sagacious guide of a cricket team who, through a mysterious blend of tactical genius and holiday planning, ensures the team is as adept at swinging bats as they are at swinging in hammocks. Known for the rare ability to teach the art of the perfect switch-hit and the secret to finding the best vacation deals during mid-season breaks. Often spotted with a clipboard in one hand and a travel brochure in the other,"" Pietersen wrote.On the field, DC, under the captaincy of Axar Patel , will look to maintain their pole position on the points table, having won five of their six matches. Gujarat Titans, currently third with four wins from six, are hot on their heels and will hope to break DC’s winning momentum in front of a home crowd.","KL Rahul and Kevin Pietersen exchange light-hearted jibes during practice.

Shriniwas Rao on TimesofIndia.com's latest episode of Bombay Sport Exchange When asked to name his “next Fab Four,” Williamson chuckled and replied, ""The five players that come to mind would be Yashasvi Jaiswal (India), Shubman Gill (India), Rachin Ravindra (New Zealand), Harry Brook (England) and Cameron Green from Australia.""Also See: MI vs SRH Coming from a player who is himself part of the modern ""Fab Four"" alongside Virat Kohli Steve Smith , and Joe Root, this endorsement carries tremendous weight.With over 9,276 Test runs at an average of 54.9, including 33 centuries, Williamson’s words reflect not just respect but a keen eye for future legends.The young Indian opener is enjoying a meteoric rise in the longer format, having already scored 1,798 runs in 19 Tests at an average of 52.9, including 4 centuries.His calm temperament and aggressive shot-making have made him a force at the top of the order.He was also part of India’s T20 World Cup-winning team, showing his growing presence in white-ball cricket, although he is yet to make his ODI debut.Gill’s classical style and adaptability have seen him become a regular in all three formats.In Tests, he has scored 1,893 runs in 32 matches with 5 centuries, averaging 35.While he hasn't quite replicated his white-ball dominance in the Test arena, he is widely regarded as the future captain of India's white-ball sides, thanks to his maturity and consistency in ODIs and T20Is.One of the most consistent and dependable new faces in the New Zealand setup, Rachin has been a key figure across all formats.In Tests, he’s scored 1,057 runs in 15 matches, averaging 37.8, with 2 centuries, including a career-best 240.His ability to slot into any role and contribute with both bat and ball makes him an all-format asset for the Kiwis.Harry Brook has been a revelation in red-ball cricket for England.In just 24 Tests, he has amassed 2,281 runs at a stunning average of 58.5, with 8 centuries and a high score of 317.His explosive style and aggression align perfectly with England’s ""Bazball"" strategy.Recognizing his potential as a leader and limited-overs performer, Brook has now been appointed England’s white-ball captain, marking a new chapter in his career.Despite battling recent injuries, Cameron Green remains a crucial all-rounder for Australia, offering balance with both bat and ball.In Tests, he’s scored 1,377 runs in 28 matches at an average of 36.2, with 2 centuries and a top score of 174*.His 13 sixes and 152 fours reflect his ability to shift gears, and when fully fit, Green is a game-changer in all three formats.Williamson’s nod to these five reflects both current performance and future potential.As the ""Fab Four"" era edges toward its twilight, this ""Fab Five"" could well be the torchbearers of the next golden generation of Test cricket.","Kane Williamson names five players to watch out for in next generation of cricketers. Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, Rachin Ravindra, Harry Brook and Cameron Green. Williamson has over 9,276 Test runs at an average of 54.9, including 33 centuries.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120379462,imgsize-40288,width-400,resizemode-4/Kane-Williamson.jpg"

Gujarat Titans:

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals (DC) take on Shubman Gill’s Gujarat Titans (GT) in Match No. 35 of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday. The Capitals currently sit atop the points table with 10 points from six games, while Gujarat trail just behind with eight points from eight outings.DC will walk in high on confidence after their edge-of-the-seat Super Over victory against Rajasthan Royals -- a game where Mitchell Starc turned the tide with his ice-cold death-over brilliance. The Aussie speedster, known for his pinpoint yorkers and late swing, was the architect of that heist and continues to lead the pace attack with authority.But Starc and co. will be up against a GT top order that’s looked ominous. Shubman Gill’s fluent strokeplay, Sai Sudharsan’s consistency, and Jos Buttler’s explosiveness have powered Gujarat’s batting thus far. Between them, they’ve notched up at least one fifty in every match — and DC will know that cracking that code early could unravel the Titans.On the flip side, all eyes will be on Mohammed Siraj, who’s found his groove after a testing season of international cricket. Siraj, fresh and firing, has bagged 10 wickets with a miserly economy of 8.50 — especially potent in the Powerplay. His matchup against Delhi’s young openers Jake Fraser-McGurk and Abishek Porel will be one to watch. The duo has shown flashes of potential but faces a stern examination under the Ahmedabad sun.And should early wickets fall, the Capitals will lean on veterans KL Rahul and Karun Nair to anchor the innings. Local lad Axar Patel, who plies his domestic trade for Gujarat, will be keen to shine at his home ground — especially now that he’s back in form with both bat and ball.Spin could prove decisive on a dry Ahmedabad deck. GT will back their seasoned duo of Rashid Khan and R Sai Kishore to keep things tight in the middle overs, while DC’s Kuldeep Yadav — if fit — will be their X-factor. His wrist spin has been Delhi’s trump card, ably complemented by the promising Vipraj Nigam. But Kuldeep’s availability remains in question after a shoulder niggle saw him leave the field in their last outing.Traditionally a true surface with pace and bounce, the Ahmedabad pitch this season has played slower than expected in afternoon games. Batters who apply themselves early can reap rewards later, but spinners and cutters into the surface have found assistance. With the match scheduled for 3:30 PM, dew won't be a factor, but dryness might.Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, KL Rahul, Karun Nair, Axar Patel (c), Tristan Stubbs, Mitchell Starc, Mukesh Kumar, Mohit Sharma, Dushmantha Chameera, Kuldeep Yadav (if fit) / Vipraj NigamAshutosh SharmaShubman Gill (c), B Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler (wk), Shahrukh Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, R Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Kagiso Rabada, Washington SundarKarim JanatA dry and hot afternoon is expected in Ahmedabad, with temperatures hovering between 33°C and 41°C.

Jaipur: Sometimes a small contribution can make a big impact. Rajasthan Royals realised it the hard way against Lucknow Super Giants here on Saturday. Avesh Khan has been hogging the limelight with his last-over heroics for Lucknow, but many experts believe it was Abdul Samad ’s little cameo for them which made the pivotal difference.Opting to bat, LSG found themselves struggling at 153/5 with two overs to go. That’s when Samad stepped in and smacked four sixes in the last over to finish their innings on a high. An explosive 30 runs off just 10 balls swelled their total to 180 for 5.The flamboyant 23-year-old Jammu batter made the perfect use of Sandeep Sharma’s military pace to hammer him over the long-on and mid-wicket region to notch up 27 runs from the 20th over. Flaunting his power-hitting muscle and dispatching the ball into the SMS Stadium stands with clean strikes, his unbeaten 30 changed RR’s fortunes.As his onslaught unfolded, few would know that Samad had arrived in Jaipur only hours before the game as his mother was admitted to a New Delhi hospital because of back issues. Samad ’s father Mohammed Farooq praised his son for showing mental toughness in the hour of crisis. “I am really proud about my son’s performance.Hitting four sixes against an experienced bowler like Sandeep Sharma is not an easy thing. As my wife was not well, Samad was with her for a couple of days after getting permission from the team management. He flew to Jaipur just before the match. I hope Samad continues to play such knocks in the remaining matches,” Farooq, himself a national-level cricketer in his college days, said.Samad’s mate, Avesh also acknowledged the impact of those last over sixes, pointing out that had Samad hit only two, the score would have been much lower, making the target more achievable. “The last overs are crucial. The momentum shifts. With his four sixes, the momentum shifted to our side.If he had hit two sixes, we would have got 165-170. It was only a difference of 10 runs. In the last over, when a bowler (Sharma) gets hit for 20-25 runs, he hands momentum to the other team. Samad provided us with a cushion in the last over,” said Avesh.After playing for Sunrisers Hyderabad for three years, Samad arrived at LSG for Rs 4.2 crore this season, largely thanks to his awesome strike rate of more than 150. Samad’s close friend Prince Utkarsh admired the way he left behind the personal troubles. “He was worried about Aunty’s health as she was bed-ridden. But knowing the importance of the match, he came here as a thorough professional cricketer,” said Utkarsh.",Abdul Samad smacked four sixes in the last over to finish their innings on a high. An explosive 30 runs off just 10 balls swelled their total to 180 for 5. The flamboyant 23-year-old Jammu batter made the perfect use of Sandeep Sharma’s military pace.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120469403,imgsize-179524,width-400,resizemode-4/Lucknow-Super-Giants-Abdul-Samad.jpg"

Kolkata: Is the chink in Kolkata Knight Riders ’ armour becoming visible? The way they lost two of their last three games, it seems the purple brigade is missing out on a finisher. At the halfway stage of the tournament, KKR head coach Chandrakant Pandit would be a worried man as they gear up to play Gujarat Titans at the Eden Gardens here on Monday.Against Lucknow Super Giants and Punjab Kings, the defending champions were cruising smoothly before they crumbled. In a high-scoring match against LSG at the Eden, chasing 239 for victory, KKR smashed 90 in the Powerplay. Even in the middle overs, they stayed on course but lost the plot at the death, losing five wickets for 23 runs in the space of 20 balls to fall short by four runs.Against PBKS, very few expected KKR to come second while chasing a target as low as 112. At 62 for two in the eighth over, victory seemed to be a foregone conclusion before they endured a sensational collapse losing their last eight wickets for just 33 runs to lose by 16 runs.KKR’s success last season came much due to the flowing starts that they got upfront. But this time, their openers Sunil Narine and Quinton de Kock have failed to provide such blistering starts putting the onus on the middle order. Despite batting deep with Ramandeep Singh coming in at No. 8, KKR have managed to put up 200-run totals only twice so far.There’s no doubt that KKR have banked heavily on their ‘RRR’ by retaining Rinku Singh Andre Russell and Ramandeep before the last mega auction. But halfway through the season, the trio has failed to live up to expectations. Things will not get any easier against GT who perhaps have the most disciplined bowling attack in this IPL.Mohammad Siraj and Prasidh Krishna have combined so well that the side is not feeling the absence of Kagiso Rabada. At the same time spinner Sai Kishore has also stood up to fill in for a below-par Rashid Khan.Probable XIIs: Kolkata Knight Riders: Ajinkya Rahane (c), Sunil Narine, Quinton de Kock (wk), Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Varun Chakravarthy, Vaibhav Arora, Moeen Ali.Gujarat Titans: Shubman Gill (capt), B Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler (wk), Sherfane Rutherford, Shahrukh Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Arshad Khan, R Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar/Ishant Sharma.",Defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders have lost two of their last three games.

Jaipur: Executing yorkers with flair and precision is Avesh Khan ’s forte. The Lucknow Super Giants speedster displayed this rare skill in abundance to bowl his side to a thrilling two-run victory against Rajasthan Royals on Saturday.Thousands of RR faitfhful at the packed Sawai Mansingh Stadium could only watch helplessly as Avesh gave away just six runs in the final over when the home team needed nine for a win and halt their losing sequence. “I just focus on the execution,” said Avesh later, “I always back 100% whatever ball I have decided to bowl.“Mostly it is the yorker,” he revealed, “even if the situation is 15 required or 20 required, I back myself on the yorker, and that is very important in the IPL . When you focus completely on the match, you focus only where you want to bowl.”The 28-year-old pacer from Madhya Pradesh believed getting rid of Yashasvi Jaiswal was the turning point of the match. The RR opener was batting fluently on 74 when a rush of blood halted his advance. “It was like ‘you miss, I hit,’” said Avesh, “Yashasvi was batting quite well and has almost put his team on the verge of victory.I decided to bowl straight and, in the block-hole.. He tried to force me out in the covers region but misjudged the line of the ball and was castled. It was certainly the turning point of the match.” Avesh said he did not feel any pressure while bowling in the death overs.“I know I am good in the death overs. I only focus on the execution at the time. When we watch from the outside, even us, we feel the tension; but when I am playing, I never feel that tension that I will go for a six or a four,” he said, underlining the process behind the return of 3 for 37 from his 4-over spell to restrict RR to 178/5 while chasing 181.Although he bowled a match-winning spell, he admitted luck favoured him in the last over. Shardul Thakur, who was fielding at the short fineleg took a blinder to send Hetmyer back to the pavilion. Even Shubham Dubey’s powerful shot hit his body and deflected to cover for a solitary run with four runs needed on the last ball.“Not that you want to get the wicket this ball or you want to make the batter defend or you want to bowl a dot ball. The moment I saw him (Hetmyer) shuffle to off, I bowled the stump line, and luckily it went to hand because he was the only fielder there.If Shubham’s shot did not hit me on my hands, it could have resulted in 2-3 runs,” said Avesh, who could not celebrate the win because of the impact of the ball",Lucknow Super Giants bowled Rajasthan Royals to a thrilling two-run victory.

Mumbai: This wasn’t a chase; it was a massacre. Wielding his willow like a murderous axe, Suryakumar Yadav (68* off 30 balls, 6x4, 5x6) clobbered Matheesha Pathirana for two consecutive sixes over extra cover and long-off in the 16th over to make a powerful statement for the Mumbai Indians , who notched up their third straight win.Message delivered: Never underestimate the five-time IPL champions. Powered by scintillating half-centuries from India’s Test and ODI captain Rohit Sharma (76* off 45 balls, 4x4, 5x6) and India’s T20 skipper Surya, and their blazing 114-run partnership off just 54 balls for the second wicket, Mumbai Indians continued their resurgence in IPL 2025 , trouncing the beleaguered Chennai Super Kings by nine wickets with 26 balls to spare at a packed Wankhede. MI have now moved up to sixth on the points table, while CSK laguish at 10th.Chasing 177, MI were off to an electrifying start with a 63-run opening stand in 40 balls between Rohit and South African ’keeper-batter Ryan Rickelton (24 off 19 balls, 3x4, 1x6), before Rohit and Surya went berserk against a clueless CSK attack, making a mockery of the target.Rohit, turning back the clock, shrugged off his average form to bring up his maiden fifty of the season, treating the Wankhede faithful to vintage pull shots and elegant pick-ups. Surya, meanwhile, was in full flow, dismantling Noor Ahmad with savage sweeps to raise his half-century in just 26 balls.Earlier, 17-year-old Ayush Mhatre , making his T20 and IPL debut at his home ground, became the latest Indian youngster to make a mark in IPL 2025. The Mumbai boy smashed a strokefilled 32 off just 15 balls, including four fours and two sixes, before fifties from Ravindra Jadeja (53* off 35 balls, 4x4, 2x6) and Shivam Dube (50 off 32 balls, 2x4, 4x6) powered CSK to 176 for five after being asked to bat first.Walking in during the fourth over after Rachin Ravindra (5) was caught behind off Ashwani Kumar, Mhatre, the youngest-ever to debut for CSK at 17 years and 278 days, lit up Wankhede with three brutal hits in four balls — a sumptuous off-drive, a towering six over long-on, and a ferocious pull off the Punjab left-arm pacer.He dominated a 41-run stand off 22 balls with Shaik Rashid (19 off 20 balls), before he was out to Deepak Chahar. The youngster, who like Prithvi Shaw hails from Virar, has long travelled by early morning trains to train in the maidans of South Mumbai — a journey that paid off with a pat from Surya himself as he walked back.After Mhatre’s departure, CSK stuttered to 73 for three in 11 overs, with 26 dot balls in that stretch, before Dube and Jadeja powered a 79-run fourth-wicket stand in 50 balls, plundering 103 runs in the last nine overs.

NEW DELHI: Sunday proved to be a day of redemption and dominance in the IPL as Mumbai Indians (MI) and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) clinched emphatic victories over Chennai Super Kings (CSK) and Punjab Kings (PBKS), respectively.At the Wankhede Stadium, MI cruised to a commanding nine-wicket win over arch-rivals CSK. India stalwarts Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav stole the show with unbeaten half-centuries.Chasing 177, the duo stitched together a 114-run stand, with Rohit scoring an unbeaten 76 and Suryakumar hammering 68 off just 30 balls. The chase was completed with 26 balls to spare, marking MI’s third straight win.Earlier, CSK managed 176/5, thanks to Ravindra Jadeja’s unbeaten 53 and Shivam Dube’s 50. Young Ayush Mhatre impressed briefly with a 15-ball 32, while MI’s Jasprit Bumrah checked the scoring with figures of 2/25, dismissing Dube and MS Dhoni in a single over. However, CSK's effort was overshadowed by the brutal brilliance of MI's batting.Meanwhile, in the other match of the day, RCB avenged their earlier loss to PBKS with a clinical seven-wicket win.Chasing 158, Devdutt Padikkal (61 off 35) and Virat Kohli (73 not out off 54) led the charge with a century-plus stand. Padikkal, scoring his first IPL fifty in 22 innings, unleashed elegant strokes while Kohli played the anchor, finishing the job with a flourish.PBKS, batting first, were restricted to 157/6 despite a promising start by Priyansh Arya (22) and Prabhsimran Singh (33). RCB spinners Krunal Pandya (2/25) and Suyash Sharma (2/27) tightened the noose after the powerplay, triggering a collapse. Punjab lost key wickets rapidly and could not recover momentum.With these results, MI’s power-packed chase and RCB’s all-round dominance saw both teams climbing up the points table, while CSK and PBKS continued to struggle for consistency in this tightly contested IPL season.",Mumbai Indians beat Chennai Super Kings by nine wickets.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) turned their revenge win over Punjab Kings into a full-blown social media spectacle, roasting their opponents with a savage throwback post featuring none other than Bollywood superstar Salman Khan Moments after their seven-wicket win on Sunday, RCB dug up an old tweet from 2014 where Salman Khan had asked on Twitter, ""Zinta's team won kya?"" In a cheeky reply, RCB quote-posted it with: “Sorry bhai, not today.”And it was not their only dig of the night.Also Visit: MI vs CSK IPL Live Score The troll was followed up with another burn, posting a video of Virat Kohli and captioning it, “Every masterpiece has a copy.

Their seamless strokeplay dismantled Punjab’s bowling attack with ease, chasing the total down in just 18.5 overs.Padikkal, finally hitting form after a long drought, showed class with his effortless shot-making, while Kohli continued his fine run, showing composure and experience.Earlier, spinners Krunal Pandya and Suyash Sharma had stifled Punjab’s batters, restricting them to a modest 157. The collapse came swiftly after a promising start, as Punjab lost wickets in clumps and never fully recovered.While RCB climbed the points table with the win, they also walked away with the last laugh online.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) beat Punjab Kings by seven wickets on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan red-ball coach Jason Gillespie has taken a direct jab at the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), revealing that he’s still waiting to be paid for work he did during his brief tenure.In a candid interview with PakPassion, the Australian great said, “Yes, without going into details.

Trent Alexander-Arnold fired Liverpool to the brink of the Premier League title as his late strike sealed a 1-0 win that relegated Leicester after Arsenal's 4-0 rout of Ipswich delayed the leaders' coronation on Sunday.Arne Slot's side could have clinched a record-equalling 20th English title with a combination of an Arsenal loss and a victory at the King Power Stadium.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Liverpool fulfilled their half of the equation, but second-placed Arsenal were not so obliging earlier in the afternoon.The Gunners' stroll at Portman Road meant Liverpool kicked off still needing six points from their last six games to seal a first title since 2020.Thanks to Alexander-Arnold's match-winning contribution after coming off the bench, Liverpool are 13 points clear of Arsenal with five games left for both teams.The Reds will seal the title if Arsenal lose at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday or if they beat Tottenham at Anfield on April 27.It looked like being a frustrating day for Liverpool as second-bottom Leicester kept them at bay despite a host of chances for the visitors.Slot's men finally made the breakthrough in the 76th minute when Alexander-Arnold lashed home the rebound from close-range after Mohamed Salah and Diogo Jota both hit the crossbar.With speculation mounting that Alexander-Arnold will join Real Madrid when his contract expires at the end of the season, it was notable that the England right-back embarked on a wild celebration of his winner.Alexander-Arnold earned a booking for ripping off his shirt and planting it on the corner flag after he sprinted to 3,000 jubilant Liverpool fans in one corner of the King Power.""It took us a long time and, of course, a great moment for Trent after working so hard to come back. To score the goal that makes a lot of difference is very special,"" Slot said.""It's never hard to dream (of the title) but you see we are really focused on playing Tottenham.""Liverpool's title celebration is only a matter of time but Leicester will spend next season in the Championship after their woeful one-year stay in the top tier came to an end with a 23rd defeat in 33 league games.Fresh from a famous victory over Real Madrid on Wednesday to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time since 2009, Arsenal ensured Liverpool would not be able to start their party this weekend.Mikel Arteta made only three changes from the 2-1 win in the Spanish capital and was rewarded with a dominant display to kill the game off inside half an hour.""All we can do is delay that moment (Liverpool win the league) from our side to earn the right to finish as high as possible,"" Arteta said.Leandro Trossard was one of those recalled by Arteta and prodded in his eighth goal of the season to open the scoring.A flowing move saw Bukayo Saka's cross flicked by Mikel Merino into the path of Gabriel Martinelli to finish to double the Gunners lead.Moments later, Saka was chopped down by an awful challenge from Leif Davis that saw the Ipswich left-back shown a straight red card.Trossard fired in his second after a well-worked corner before Ethan Nwaneri's deflected effort rounded off the scoring.Defeat realistically ends third-bottom Ipswich's hope of maintaining their Premier League status as they are 15 points adrift of safety with five games remaining and have a significantly poorer goal difference than West Ham.Chelsea needed two late goals at Fulham to revive their chances of Champions League football next season with a dramatic 2-1 victory.Alex Iwobi opened the scoring on 20 minutes and Chelsea were meandering towards a damaging defeat until 19-year-old substitute Tyrique George fired in a snap shot from the edge of the box on 83 minutes.Pedro Neto then completed the comeback with a stunning strike in stoppage-time to secure Chelsea's sixth win in their last 17 league games.Fifth-placed Chelsea moved above Nottingham Forest, who travel to Tottenham on Monday.

Manchester City bolstered their bid to qualify for the Champions League with a dramatic 2-0 win at Everton , while Southampton 's last-gasp equaliser at West Ham ensured they will not have sole possession of the lowest points total in Premier League history.City were heading towards a damaging draw before Nico O'Reilly's 84th minute strike put them on course for a vital victory that was sealed by Mateo Kovacic's goal in the final seconds.Pep Guardiola's side climb to fourth place, four points ahead of sixth-placed Chelsea, who face Fulham on Sunday in their game in hand.Fifth-placed Nottingham Forest , who travel to Tottenham on Monday, are one point adrift of City.At a stage of the season when they are usually embroiled in a battle to win the title, City -- champions in six of the previous seven campaigns -- have been reduced to scrapping for a Champions League berth after a dismal season.They remain on course to achieve their bare minimum target after a hard-fought success on Merseyside.In the 84th minute, Matheus Nunes's low cross into the six-yard box was met by the 20-year-old O'Reilly, who got in front of Michael Keane to poke home from close range.O'Reilly has emerged as an unlikely hero for City after the Manchester-born midfielder scored last week in the win against Crystal Palace and netted twice against Plymouth in the FA Cup.Kovacic wrapped up City's victory on their last visit to Goodison Park before Everton move to a new stadium next season.The Croatian guided Ilkay Gundogan's pass into the bottom corner to give City a third win from their last four league games.""To win here at Goodison Park, where Liverpool and Arsenal couldn't, is massively important,"" Guardiola said.""Now it is in our hands. Three games at home, two away and hopefully we can achieve this big success to qualify for the Champions League.""Relegated Southampton rescued a 1-1 draw at West Ham to guarantee they won't have the indignity of being the lone club with the Premier League's worst ever points tally.Jarrod Bowen struck for the Hammers in the 47th minute, holding off Ryan Manning before lashing a fierce finish past Aaron Ramsdale.But Lesley Ugochukwu equalised three minutes into second half stoppage-time as he lashed past Alphonse Areola.Bottom of the table Southampton are now on 11 points -- the same number Derby managed in 2007-08 -- and have five games left to leave the Rams with the lowest total ever recorded in the Premier League.Brentford beat 10-man Brighton 4-2 to damage the Seagulls' prospects of qualifying for Europe with their first home win since December.Thomas Frank's side took a ninth minute lead when Lewis Keane-Potter's precise pass through the heart of the Brighton defence picked out Bryan Mbeumo and he confidently slotted homeDanny Welbeck hauled Brighton level in first half stoppage-time with a powerful header from Mats Wieffer's cross.Mbeumo restored Brentford's advantage three minutes after half-time, his strike taking a hefty deflection off Brighton defender Lewis Dunk on its way past Bart Verbruggen.Yoane Wissa bagged Brentford's third in the 58th minute, running onto Mbeumo's pass and finishing with the help of a deflection off Jan Paul van Hecke.Brighton striker Joao Pedro was sent off in the 61st minute for a needless kick at Nathan Collins.Japan forward Kaoru Mitoma reduced the deficit in the 81st minute, but Christian Norgaard headed home in stoppage-time to end Brighton's hopes of a late escape.Crystal Palace held on for a 0-0 draw against Bournemouth despite playing half the match with 10 men.Palace were reduced to 10 men just before half-time at Selhurst Park when Chris Richards was sent off for a second booking after the defender fouled Justin Kluivert.Third-placed Newcastle will look to step up their Champions League qualification surge when they travel to Aston Villa in Saturday's late game.",Manchester City beat Everton 2-0 in English Premier League.

Barcelona staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Celta Vigo 4-3 at home on Saturday, extending their La Liga lead to seven points over Real Madrid. After trailing 3-1 with less than 30 minutes remaining, Barcelona's Dani Olmo and Raphinha , who scored twice including a 98th-minute penalty, secured the crucial victory.Barcelona took an early lead through Ferran Torres in the 12th minute, who scored from the edge of the box after finding space in Celta's defence.Celta Vigo responded quickly, with Borja Iglesias equalising three minutes later. Pablo Duran's cross found Iglesias, who scored into an empty net after goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny failed to intercept.Barcelona's attempts to regain the lead saw Raphinha sending a free-kick over the bar and Robert Lewandowski missing the target. Szczesny made important saves from Ilaix Moriba and Iker Losada at the other end.Iglesias put Celta ahead early in the second half, capitalizing on Frenkie de Jong's error to score past Szczesny. He later completed his hat-trick after being set up by Sergio Carreira, taking advantage of Barcelona's high defensive line.""This is football, we really wanted to win, maybe we weren't at our best but the response from the team, and the fans pushed us on... we deserved it,"" Olmo told DAZN. ""These are three points that take us closer to our objective, they're important and we have to continue.""Barcelona coach Hansi Flick had initially rested 17-year-old Lamine Yamal for the first time in 2025 but brought him on after Iglesias' third goal.The comeback began when Raphinha assisted Olmo, who beat goalkeeper Vicente Guaita. Raphinha then scored himself, heading in Yamal's cross from the right.Celta missed a chance to secure the win when Oscar Mingueza headed wide from close range in the 90th minute.The decisive moment came in the 96th minute when VAR review led to a penalty after Yoel Lago fouled Olmo. With Lewandowski substituted, Raphinha converted the spot-kick into the top-right corner.""It's a bittersweet feeling... we scored three, which few teams can do here, but it feels bad,"" said Celta's Duran. ""We have to be proud of our team, we came here with personality, played well, had a good plan and carried it out -- but for small details it got away from us.""The victory maintains Barcelona's strong position in the title race, with Real Madrid set to face Athletic Bilbao on Sunday and a Clasico matchup scheduled for May.Celta Vigo, currently seventh in La Liga and competing for European qualification, showed attacking prowess throughout the match despite the eventual defeat.","Barcelona come from behind to defeat Celta Vigo 4-3 in La Liga.

Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti announced on Saturday that he will discuss his future with the club at the end of the season, following their UEFA Champions League exit after a 5-1 aggregate loss to Arsenal in the quarter-finals.Speculation about Ancelotti's dismissal has intensified since Wednesday's elimination from the Champions League, despite his contract running until 2026.""At the end of the season we will speak about my future with the club,"" Ancelotti said at a news conference, avoiding multiple questions about his position.The 65-year-old Italian coach emphasised the immediate focus on remaining competitions after meeting with players and club officials.""I have spoken with the players and the club, we all agree, we have to fight for the titles there are on the line,"" Ancelotti stated ahead of Sunday's La Liga match against Athletic Bilbao.Real Madrid currently sit four points behind Barcelona in La Liga and will face their rivals in the Copa del Rey final on April 26.""Obviously we are all hurt, and the fans, after going out of maybe the most important competition, or at least the one Madrid has had the most success in, in recent years,"" Ancelotti acknowledged.The coach highlighted his relationship with club president Florentino Perez .

Manchester, Apr 18, 2025 -Manchester United came from 4-2 down in extra-time to beat Lyon 5-4 in a remarkable Europa League quarter-final to progress 7-6 on aggregate on Thursday.United's season looked over when Lyon came from 2-0 down to lead by two goals with just six minutes remaining at Old Trafford despite having captain Corentin Tolisso sent off.However, a Bruno Fernandes ' penalty, Kobbie Mainoo's strike and Harry Maguire's header capped a stunning finale to set up a semi-final meeting with Athletic Bilbao.""I felt that here everything is possible,"" said United boss Ruben Amorim . ""After the 4-3, the penalty from Bruno, you feel that you can change the game.""The Red Devils sit 14th in the English top flight and defeat would have almost certainly meant missing out on European football entirely next season.Instead they are just three games away from a European trophy and the lifeline of direct access to the riches of the Champions League next season.""Everybody in this moment believes it is possible,"" added Amorim.""One moment can change a lot of things in the players' minds.""United's history is built on dramatic late fightbacks, but few have been more remarkable than this to leave Lyon shellshocked.The home side got off to a flying start thanks to a fine team goal as Fernandes released Alejandro Garnacho down the right and his cross picked out Ugarte to slot in just his second goal since joining the English giants from Paris Saint-Germain.Amorim's decision to restore Andre Onana in goal was under scrutiny.The Cameroonian had been dropped for Sunday's 4-1 thrashing at Newcastle after two costly errors that led to both Lyon's goals in last week's 2-2 first leg draw.Those mistakes came after a war of words with former United midfielder Nemanja Matic, who labelled him ""one of the worst goalkeepers in United's history"".The 29-year-old rewarded his manager's faith with a couple of important stops to prevent Lyon levelling through Paul Akouokou and Rayan Cherki.At the other end, a United side that have often looked laboured and lacking in ideas all season, suddenly clicked into gear in the first 45 minutes.United doubled their lead in first-half stoppage time when Maguire's long ball was expertly controlled by Diogo Dalot, who then fired in off the inside of the post.Garnacho should have killed the tie off within minutes of the restart for the second half when he shot straight at Lucas Perri with Fernandes begging for a pass for a tap in.But the defensive deficiencies and mental fragility of Amorim's side were exposed in a collapse that threatened to cap a miserable campaign.Alexandre Lacazette flicked on Moussa Niakhate's header and Corentin Tolisso swooped to head in and give the visitors a lifeline.Nicolas Tagliafico then prodded in at the back post despite Onana's attempt to scoop it off the line.Just as Lyon were in the ascendency Tolisso gave them a mountain to climb again with a soft second yellow for a trip on Casemiro.Yet, it did not initially matter as Cherki confirmed his status as one of Europe's rising stars with a powerful drive that left Onana motionless.Lyon's other prized asset, Malick Fofana, was then chopped down by Luke Shaw inside the area and Lacazette confidently dispatched the resulting spot-kick.Another penalty at the other end, though, kickstarted the fightback as Fernandes fired home after a VAR review for a foul on Casemiro.Substitute Mainoo showed why he had been thrust in an unfamiliar forward role with a composed finish to level on 120 minutes.Barely 60 seconds later Maguire completed the comeback with a towering header at the back post.""In this moment it is difficult to believe what has just happened,"" said Lyon coach Paulo Fonseca.It is the first time ever in European competition that five goals have been scored in extra-time.",Manchester United came from 4-2 down in extra-time to beat Lyon 5-4 in a remarkable Europa League quarter-final to progress 7-6 on aggregate.

NEW DELHI: Arsenal secured a historic 2-1 victory against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday, advancing to the Champions League semifinals for the first time since 2009 with a 5-1 aggregate score.The match featured crucial VAR interventions in two penalty decisions, with Arsenal maintaining their impressive first-leg advantage of 3-0 from London.Arsenal will now face Paris Saint-Germain in the semifinals, while Inter Milan, who defeated Bayern Munich, will meet Barcelona in the other semifinal matchup.Real Madrid, the defending champion and 15-time European winner, failed to produce one of their trademark comebacks at the Bernabeu, falling short of the last four for the first time since 2020.""There was a lot of talk coming here about (Real Madrid) coming back, because they've done it so many times before, but we had so much belief and confidence from that first game to come here and win the game,"" said Arsenal's Declan Rice, who had scored twice in the first leg through free kicks. ""We knew we were going to suffer, but we knew we were going to win. We had it in our minds and now we've done it in real life.""The match's momentum shifted early when VAR overturned a penalty for Real Madrid following a hold on Kylian Mbappé, after a five-minute review with the score at 0-0.Arsenal had earlier missed their own VAR-awarded penalty when Bukayo Saka failed to convert from the spot.Saka later redeemed himself by scoring in the 65th minute after receiving a pass from Mikel Merino, though Madrid quickly equalized through Vinícius Júnior following a defensive error by William Saliba.Gabriel Martinelli sealed Arsenal's victory with a stoppage-time goal, assisted by Merino.""This is one of the best nights in my football career, for sure,"" Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta said. ""It's a really special one against a team that has been an inspiration for a lot of us in this competition. To win this tie in the manner that we have, we can be very proud.""Mbappé's substitution in the 75th minute due to an apparent injury drew jeers from some Bernabeu supporters, marking another disappointing Champions League campaign for the French star.""It's a tough moment,"" Madrid's Lucas Vazquez said. ""We tried but in the end we couldn't achieve our goal. We'll come back stronger. Madrid always does.""Real Madrid's task was challenging from the outset, facing an Arsenal team that hadn't lost by a three-goal margin in nearly three years. Only four teams in Champions League history had overcome a three-goal first-leg deficit at home.The match began with early drama as Madrid had a goal disallowed after two minutes when Mbappé was caught offside.Arsenal maintained their unbeaten record against Real Madrid, extending it to four matches, including their previous Champions League knockout stage victory in 2005-06.The game featured significant VAR involvement, with Arsenal's penalty awarded after review showed Raúl Asencio holding Mikel Merino during a corner kick.Another VAR review led to the reversal of Madrid's penalty claim after initially being awarded for a hold on Mbappé by Rice.The victory marks Arsenal's return to the Champions League semifinals after a 15-year absence, with their last appearance ending in elimination by Manchester United in 2008-09.",Arsenal defeat Real Madrid 2-1 in Champions League quarterfinals.

""It was a house where, occasionally, a doctor would come to see him.""She described finding the house in deplorable conditions after her father's death, stating it was ""disgusting, and it smelled like urine.""Dalma also revealed she had attempted to visit her father days before his death but was denied entry by his lawyer and an assistant.Prosecutors allege Maradona endured a ""prolonged, agonizing period"" before his death, having battled cocaine and alcohol addiction for decades.The trial, which had faced delays, is expected to continue until July with nearly 120 witnesses scheduled to testify.The defendants are accused of abandoning their patient and pursuing a course of action despite knowing it could result in his death.","Dalma Maradona testified in court on Tuesday in San Isidro, Argentina, stating that her father's death in November 2020 could have been prevented if his medical team had provided proper care.

How Nico Mueller secured the top spot

Andretti driver Nico Mueller and his race engineer Bertrand Mermine have surged to the top of the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard following a dramatic Miami Grand Prix, where post-race penalties reshuffled the final standings in Mueller’s favour. Though he originally crossed the line in 10th, Mueller was promoted to 4th, thanks to a well-timed strategy and a dash of late-race chaos. His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace. The season concludes with an award for the top-ranked pairing.After Round 5 in Miami, the leaderboard has Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne and his race engineer Thibault Arnal on number 2. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries and race engineer Tom Bayles are in third position in the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard.The FIA Formula E Instagram account also shared the update, posting:“@nico.mueller51 overtaking his way up the rankings! With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued. Drivers including Norman Nato, Robin Frijns, Oliver Rowland, Sam Bird, and Taylor Barnard were penalized 10 seconds each for misuse of Attack Mode, while Nick Cassidy received a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits.Also Read: Formula E Miami E-Prix 2025: Jake Hughes crashes at chicane, here’s how the multi-car collision changed the outcome.

Formula E is now in its 11th season since its debut in 2014, and the electric motorsport has achieved impressive success, carving its own identity despite the dominance of Formula 1. One of the key indicators of this success is the growing grid of 11 teams and 22 drivers—one more than the 10 teams in F1. While drivers like Oliver Rowland and Pascal Wehrlein have previously tested their skills in F1, it seems they've found their true calling in the more sustainable and rapidly evolving Formula E.Oliver Rowland is currently leading the Formula E standings with 68 points, thanks to his victory at this season’s Mexico City E-Prix. Rowland had a brief stint with F1 team Williams in 2018 before transitioning to Formula E, where he raced for Mahindra Racing and then Nissan, ultimately making a name for himself with the Japanese team. Antonio Felix da Costa, driving for Porsche, is also a formidable force in the series. He currently sits in third place with 39 points this season, continuing to prove his prowess on the track.Maximilian Günther has made a strong impression after his move from Maserati MSG Racing to DS Penske. At the Jeddah E-Prix, Günther took pole position, posted the fastest lap, and ultimately clinched the victory. With this standout performance, he’s now eyeing an even higher position, currently sitting fourth in the driver standings.German driver Pascal Wehrlein, another former F1 racer, began his Formula E career with Mahindra Racing before joining Tag Heuer Porsche. After winning the Formula E World Championship last season, Wehrlein has maintained his strong form, registering the fastest lap in two races this season—at the São Paulo and Mexico City E-Prix. He’s currently in eighth place with 25 points but remains a serious contender with 7 career wins and 6 pole positions to his name.Mitch Evans, a consistent presence with Jaguar TCS Racing since 2016, continues to be among the best drivers in Formula E. He secured a win for Jaguar at the São Paulo E-Prix in December, propelling him to seventh in the standings with 25 points, keeping him in the mix for the championship.At just 20 years old, Taylor Barnard is quickly establishing himself as one of the brightest young talents in Formula E.

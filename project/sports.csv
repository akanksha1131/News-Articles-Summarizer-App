Women's World Cup: Greenstone Lobo predicts India's chances

WATCH:

NEW DELHI: The night India stormed into the ICC Women’s World Cup final will forever be remembered not just for Jemimah Rodrigues ’ record-breaking hundred, but for the emotional embrace that followed — a daughter’s tearful hug with her parents in the stands after conquering the world champions.As soon as India completed their historic chase of 339 against Australia, Jemimah dropped to her knees in relief. Followed by tears — and a long, heartfelt gaze toward the stands where her family sat. Minutes later, cameras captured the moment that melted a nation: Jemimah hugging her father and coach Ivan Rodrigues and her family members, all in tears, as the crowd roared around them.The broadcaster’s caption on social media summed it up perfectly: “Pure moments of joy! Tears, smiles, and family hugs. Jemimah’s match-winning knock says it all!”For Jemimah, it was not just about runs — it was redemption. “Towards the end, I was just quoting a scripture from the Bible — to just stand still and that God will fight for me,” she said, her voice trembling at the post-match presentation. “I have almost cried every day through this tour… not doing well mentally, going through anxiety.I knew I had to show up, and God took care of everything.”Her 127 not out off 134 balls, guided by faith and resolve, will go down as one of the greatest innings in World Cup history. “I just stood there and He fought for me… I want to thank Jesus, my mom, dad and coach. It feels like a dream and it still hasn’t sunk in.”Jemimah also revealed she didn’t even know she would bat at No. 3 until minutes before walking out. “Five minutes before, they told me I’m in at three. When Harry di came, it was all about one good partnership.”From prayers whispered between deliveries to tears flowing in her parents’ arms, Jemimah’s night in Navi Mumbai was more than cricket — it was faith, family, and fulfillment wrapped in one unforgettable embrace.","Jemimah Rodrigues' 127 not out off 134 balls will go down as one of the greatest innings in World Cup history.

Kolkata: Bengal's Mohammed Shami celebrates (PTI Photo/Swapan Mahapatra)

NEW DELHI: Mohammed Shami carries the air of a man who has endured one too many swings of misfortune in his life. At 35, he is certainly not getting younger. Ajit Agarkar, the chief selector, has in many words made it clear that they are looking beyond Shami.But the Bengal pacer is not done. There has been a war of words between Shami and Agarkar in the recent past. Now, Shami’s bowling is doing the talking. In two Ranji Trophy matches of the 2025-26 season, he has already taken 15 wickets and announced himself to be “fit” and “ready” for an India comeback.“He is taking wickets with the new ball, he is taking wickets with the old ball. He is bowling long spells. He has picked up 15 wickets in two matches. He has played all the domestic tournaments. What else do Ajit Agarkar and his team need to believe that he is 100 per cent fit?” Shami’s childhood coach Mohammed Badruddin tells TimesofIndia.com.“To question his fitness is just a sheer stupid reason. Agar aapko khilana hi nahi hai toh seedha mana kar do (If you don’t want him to play, just say no). It is disrespectful to a bowler of Shami’s calibre and what he has done for his country,” said Badruddin.This is not the first time Shami has battled all odds.In his teens, he was rejected by his home state Uttar Pradesh during a U-19 trial. While playing for India, he came back from the brink of retirement following his knee surgery. He survived a near-death road accident and later his personal life went for a toss. During an Instagram Live chat with Rohit Sharma during the lockdown, Shami admitted that he had contemplated suicide on three occasions while battling “severe stress and personal issues.” The pacer also faced brutal online trolling following India’s defeat to Pakistan in the 2021 T20 World Cup in Dubai.But he always bounces back.Apart from moving the ball both ways, Shami also has two ingrained ingredients in him — “zid” to prove everyone wrong and “junoon” to prove himself again and again. These have helped Shami rise above pain and rejection.Shreevats Goswami, Shami’s former Bengal teammate who was doing commentary during the Ranji Trophy match against Gujarat at the iconic Eden Gardens, calls him the “Rolls-Royce” of fast bowling.“Everything about Shami’s bowling -- right from the run-up, the wrist position, the seam presentation, the ability to hit the hard length, is sheer poetry. When his ball hits the wicketkeeper’s gloves, you can hear that thud sound,” says Goswami.Goswami, who has seen Shami’s rise from close quarters and has been his confidant for years, revealed what keeps the pacer going.“If there’s one thing he likes the most apart from his favourite biryani, it’s the sound of rattling stumps. He’s very passionate about his bowling,” Goswami says with a laugh.After a brief pause, Goswami also spoke about Shami’s “stubbornness.”“I think it’s just the will, man. He enjoys taking wickets. And then there’s his stubbornness -- that ‘I can do it.’ He has a very strong belief system,” says the former cricketer.“You’ll never see bowlers on billboards. Bowlers always go under the radar. Shami is the Virat Kohli of Indian bowling,” he adds.Shami, who last represented India in the Champions Trophy triumph and finished as the country’s top wicket-taker alongside Varun Chakravarthy, has battled recurring ankle and knee injuries that required surgery after the 2023 World Cup.The 35-year-old has not been part of the Indian Test side for a while, having last played in the World Test Championship final against Australia in June 2023.“I had a lengthy chat with him. He says he is ready, and it is up to the selectors.“He’s ready to play all three formats. He told me, ‘I played all the games of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy last year. I played all the games of the Vijay Hazare Trophy as well. I played the Champions Trophy too. So now it’s up to the selectors. If they pick me, I’m ready to play. If not, I’ll keep playing here and keep performing.’”Shami bowled 18 overs in the first innings and another 10 in the second, following up on nearly 40 overs in the opening game against Uttarakhand. If there were ever doubts about his fitness, those numbers alone crushed them. Shami’s engine is still running strong and the intensity is undiminished.“Gend abhi bhi uske haath se lehra rahi hai” (The ball is still leaving beautifully from his hands). “There are still three years of cricket left in him. For an ageing fast bowler, it’s not easy to find rhythm after a long injury layoff. But now he’s found it back,” says Badruddin.Badruddin feels that in the ODI series in Australia, where fast bowlers like Josh Hazlewood made life difficult for Indian batters, Shami could have been more than useful. But he believes India’s loss is Bengal’s blessing.“Bengal have two wins in two. If he plays the entire season, he might end up helping Bengal win the Ranji Trophy,” says a proud coach.After his heroics against Gujarat, the Bengal pacer emphasised that he is fully fit after recovering from ankle surgery and is available for all formats of the game.“A lot of hard work has gone in, and I believe luck too plays a part. Every person wants to play for the country. So I am ready for that (again),” Shami told reporters.Through every injury, setback, and storm, Shami has stood tall. The ball still moves like magic from his hand -- proof that class and courage never dwindle.And with his two friends, “zid” and “junoon,” by his side, there’s still plenty left in Shami’s tank -- and his story is far from over.",Mohammed Shami has taken 15 wickets in two Ranji Trophy matches. The 35-year-old has not been part of the Indian Test side for the last two years. Shami's childhood coach Mohammed Badruddin says he is 100 per cent fit.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124960369,imgsize-67334,width-400,resizemode-4/ranji-trophy-bengal-vs-gujarat-day-4.jpg"

Shubman Gill vs Jasprit Bumrah in the nets: Exciting contest between star players

NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill 's poised yet powerful batting display in the rain-marred first T20I against Australia in Canberra has reignited comparisons with Virat Kohli 's hallmark composure and efficiency. The Indian vice-captain looked in complete control at the top of the order, remaining unbeaten on 37 off just 20 balls before the skies opened up and play was eventually called off.Gill's innings, which featured crisp timing and effortless strokeplay, reflected a growing maturity that has become a defining feature of his batting. Even without taking undue risks, he maintained a strike rate of 185, underlining his ability to dominate bowlers without appearing aggressive.Former India wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik was among those left impressed, drawing a striking comparison between Gill's style and that of former skipper Virat Kohli. Speaking on Cricbuzz, Karthik said, “This is what Virat Kohli does in ODIs. You'll never know where he is till you look at the scorecard. You'll think he has only been around sometime and he'll be on 45.”The veteran cricketer noted that Gill's innings mirrored Kohli's signature ability to score freely while appearing unhurried.Karthik also touched on the intense competition within India's T20 setup, acknowledging that Gill's place at the top of the order is far from a given.“I am sure he is aware of the kind of players he is keeping out, starting from Sanju (Samson) opening, Yashasvi (Jaiswal) and the rest like Ruturaj and KL Rahul. It's not easy to be a T20 player right now — you need to be consistent, exceptionally skilled and almost play a match-winning knock every second or third game. That's the kind of depth India has,” Karthik added.Karthik believes Gill's growing leadership stature — as captain in Tests and ODIs and vice-captain in T20Is — has further boosted his self-belief.“The fact that he is the Indian captain and vice-captain will give him a lot of confidence. That helps you up to a point, but then you need to go out there and put out the runs, which he has done nicely today,” Karthik added.For India, Gill's evolving balance between flair and focus could be the key as they build toward next year's T20 World Cup.",Shubman Gill scores 37 off just 20 balls in first T20I against Australia.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings ’ young wicketkeeper-batter Urvil Patel gave fans a glimpse of the future this week with a brilliant display of skills behind the stumps — one that reminded many of legend Mahendra Singh Dhoni ’s magic.In a video shared on his Instagram, 27-year-old Urvil can be seen executing a lightning-fast stumping that left the batter stunned. As the ball zipped past the outside edge, the batter’s back foot lifted for just a split second — and that was enough. Urvil, in true Dhoni style, whipped off the bails in a flash before anyone could blink.Click here to watch Urvil Patel’s stunning stumping The clip, captioned, quickly went viral. Fans flooded the comments section praising the youngster’s reflexes, and even CSK’s official handle joined in, commenting,While speculation continues over whether MS Dhoni will return for another IPL season, CSK fans are already seeing hope in Urvil — a player who seems to be carrying the Dhoni legacy forward with confidence and composure.Urvil has also been in superb touch with the bat. Playing for Gujarat in the Ranji Trophy against Bengal at Eden Gardens, he produced a stunning counter-attack when his team was in deep trouble. Chasing a stiff target of 327, Gujarat were tottering at 50 for 3 when Urvil walked in at number three.With wickets tumbling around him, the young wicketkeeper held his nerve, mixing caution with calculated aggression.He went on to score a fighting 96-ball century, reaching the landmark with a crisp drive through the covers. Urvil’s innings of 109 off 124 balls, decorated with 14 fours and 2 sixes, injected belief into Gujarat’s dressing room. He also stitched together a vital 100-run stand with Jaymeet (34) that briefly raised hopes of an unlikely chase.Facing a strong Bengal bowling attack featuring Mohammed Shami, Akashdeep, Abhishek Porel, and Shahbaz Ahmed, Urvil looked unflustered, taking on the pacers with confidence and reading the spinners smartly. However, after he retired hurt due to cramps, Gujarat’s resistance fell apart, collapsing to 185 all out, handing Bengal a 141-run win.Despite the defeat, Urvil’s knock stood out as the highlight of the match. It was an innings that not only showcased his temperament and shot-making ability but also his ability to perform under pressure — a quality that will serve him well in bigger stages.The 26-year-old has already built a reputation in T20 cricket, holding the record for the fastest century by an Indian in T20s — off just 28 balls against Tripura in 2024.

Former World Champion and Russian Grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik has once again defended his conduct surrounding the tragic death of American GM Daniel Naroditsky, insisting that he “never accused Daniel of cheating” and that his comments were based on “serious material” rather than baseless allegations.Speaking to Saudi Arabian outlet Al Arabiya, Kramnik rejected claims that his suspicions toward Naroditsky's performances had fueled online hostility before the American's death earlier this month.“I never accused Daniel of cheating,” Kramnik said. “What I did, I collected very, very serious material and I will stand by it and prove it in any commission or whatever is needed. There are many strange things that need to be examined. Unfortunately, instead of examining it, I started being accused of misconduct.”The 50-year-old Russian reiterated that his remarks had been “argumentised suspicion” rather than public accusation.“It was not an accusation, not a baseless accusation as they pretend, and that would be the basis of my legal case,” Kramnik continued. “I said many times it's not an accusation and asked for it to be considered, but it didn't happen — and that's one of the main reasons this very sad tragedy occurred.”Kramnik maintained that he feels no guilt for what happened and claimed that a “dirty, orchestrated PR campaign” was being waged against him.“It's completely tragic what happened. It's heartbreaking for me also, but I have no guilt in it. This very dirty, very organised PR campaign against me will be a cause of many criminal and civil cases we are preparing,” he said.“We will meet in court, and I'm sure the court will see real facts, not PR.

Bombay Sport Exchange | 'The unconditional leader of Indian cricket'

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's mystery spinner Usman Tariq has revealed that his remarkable return to cricket was inspired by the MS Dhoni biopic, which reignited his passion for the sport after years away from the game.The 27-year-old, who has earned his maiden call-up to Pakistan's T20I squad for the ongoing three-match series against South Africa, said he left a stable job in Dubai to give his cricketing dream one last shot.“I left the game after I did not get selected, and was working as a salesman in a purchasing company in Dubai. There I watched MS Dhoni: The Untold Story and it inspired me a lot. I left the job and came back to Pakistan to pursue cricket again,” Tariq told Telecom Asia Sport.His gamble paid off. Tariq claimed 20 wickets in the 2025 Caribbean Premier League, finishing second only to veteran Imran Tahir . Now, he stands on the cusp of a potential international debut for Pakistan.Tariq's bowling action has attracted plenty of attention — and some controversy. He pauses dramatically in his delivery stride, almost coming to a complete halt before hurling the ball with a side-arm flick reminiscent of Ravichandran Ashwin Although his action was initially reported as illegal during the 2024 Pakistan Super League, he was later cleared after biomechanical testing in Lahore.The spinner explained that his action is partly due to a physical peculiarity:“I was born with a unique right elbow which has two corners,” Tariq said.Looking back, Tariq says his story is one of belief and resilience.“I just want to play for Pakistan and perform. It took a long time to reach here, but every setback has made me stronger,” he added.From a Dubai salesman to Pakistan's latest mystery spinner — Usman Tariq's journey proves that cinematic dreams can sometimes become reality.",Mystery spinner Usman Tariq has been called up to Pakistan's T20I squad.

Shubman Gill vs Jasprit Bumrah in the nets: Exciting contest between star players

Poll What position should Sanju Samson primarily bat in for T20 matches? Opening position Middle order (No. 3-5) Lower order (No. 6-8)

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Kris Srikkanth has launched a fiery defense of Sanju Samson , saying the wicketkeeper-batter has been unfairly treated despite proving his worth at the top of the order in T20 internationals.Srikkanth, never one to mince words, expressed his frustration over the constant shuffling of Samson's batting position, which he believes has disrupted the Kerala cricketer's rhythm and confidence.“The guy who's most unlucky is Sanju Samson,” Srikkanth said on his YouTube channel. “He was scoring centuries as an opener. But now they send him everywhere — from No. 3 to No. 8. If given an opportunity, they may send him at No. 11 also! A person like Sanju will naturally feel bad after doing so well at the top, but he has no option but to be tight-lipped and bat wherever the team asks him to.”Since India's 2024 T20 World Cup triumph, Samson has been one of their most explosive openers, smashing three centuries and averaging 37 at a strike rate of 183 in just 13 innings. His partnership with Abhishek Sharma at the top had been instrumental in India's new aggressive T20 template.However, with Shubman Gill 's return to the T20I setup during the Asia Cup , Samson was pushed down the order — batting at No. 5 thrice, once at No. 3, and even not getting to bat until No. 8 against Bangladesh.Despite the inconsistency, Samson played a crucial hand in the Asia Cup final, scoring a valuable 21-ball 24 in India's tense last-over win against Pakistan.Srikkanth, though critical of Samson's treatment, remains optimistic about his future. “The only good thing is he did well at No. 5 in the Asia Cup. It's a good sign because Sanju is now the automatic choice as the first wicketkeeper for the T20 World Cup,” he said.Looking ahead, the former India opener predicted that the XI which played the opening T20I against Australia in Canberra is “more or less the World Cup team,” with Hardik Pandya replacing Harshit Rana.“The team is almost set,” Srikkanth concluded. “Now it's just about getting match practice and rhythm before the World Cup.”",Former India cricketer Kris Srikkanth says Sanju Samson has been unfairly treated.

So, my wife was telling me, ‘Why are you being so mean? He is such a sweet guy.’”Rahul added that what fans saw online was only a small part of their constant back-and-forth. “Half the things that he does to me and tells me, that doesn’t come out,” he said.“This is three times that I have given out of the 100 times he is after my life.”He also recalled a funny moment from a dinner with Pietersen and his wife during a trip to England earlier this year. “I complained to his wife when we were in the UK. They invited me for dinner and I told her, ‘Tell your husband to go easy on me. He is very rude to me,’” Rahul laughed.Their friendly exchanges added charm to Delhi Capitals’ 2025 campaign, often giving fans entertaining moments on social media.

Shreyas Iyer injury: Greenstone Lobo says Iyer got lucky, predicts comeback

The horror moment

NEW DELHI: India cricketer Shreyas Iyer has spoken publicly for the first time since his life-threatening on-field injury in Sydney, posting a heartfelt message to fans on Thursday as he continues to recover from a spleen laceration suffered during the third ODI against Australia.The Indian ODI vice-captain, who was briefly in the ICU following the incident, thanked fans for their overwhelming support in a message shared on social media platforms.“I’m currently in the recovery process and getting better, every passing day. I’m deeply grateful to see all the kind wishes and support I’ve received — it truly means a lot.

ABC

A promising 17-year-old Australian cricketer has died after being struck by a ball during practice in Melbourne, leaving his local sporting community heartbroken.Ben Austin, 17, was reportedly training at the Wally Tew Reserve in Ferntree Gully on Tuesday afternoon when the freak accident occurred. According to reports, the teenager was facing deliveries from an automatic bowling machine in the nets while wearing a helmet when he was hit in the head and neck area.Paramedics rushed to the scene, and Austin was taken to Monash Medical Centre in a critical condition. Despite the best efforts of the doctors, he died on Wednesday.""We are utterly devastated by the passing of our beautiful Ben, who died earlier on Thursday morning,"" his father Jace Austin said in a statement.""This tragedy has taken Ben from us, but we find some comfort that he was doing something he did for so many summers -– going down to the nets with mates to play cricket.""We would also like to support his teammate who was bowling in the nets. This accident has impacted two young men and our thoughts are with he and his family as well.""The Ferntree Gully Cricket Club, where Ben played, confirmed his death in a statement on Thursday, saying the entire community was “absolutely devastated.”“We are absolutely devastated by the passing of Ben, and the impacts of his death will be felt by all in our cricket community,” the club wrote on social media. “Our thoughts and prayers are with his family – Jace, Tracey, Cooper, and Zach – his extended family, friends, and all who knew Ben and the joy that he brought.”Ben was described by his club as a “star cricketer, great leader, and an awesome young man.” He also represented Mulgrave and Eildon Park cricket clubs and played junior football for Waverley Park Hawks.Ferntree Gully and District Cricket Association president Arnie Walters called Austin “both talented and popular,” adding, “We will provide any and all support we can to our clubs and cricket family.”Victorian Education Minister Ben Carroll said grief support was being offered to students at Rowville Secondary College, where Ben studied. “We will wrap our arms around them and give them every support they need,” he said. “This is a tragedy that will last many years for that local community.”Austin’s death has drawn comparisons to the 2014 tragedy that claimed the life of Australian Test batter Phillip Hughes , who was struck in the neck during a Sheffield Shield game. Hughes’s death prompted sweeping safety reforms in cricket.Cricket Victoria chief Nick Cummins told broadcasterthere were similarities between the two tragedies.""The ball hit him (Austin) in the neck in a similar accident that Phil Hughes suffered 10 years ago,"" Cummins said.Cricket Australia chair Mike Baird said his heart ""was broken"" and lessons needed to be learned.""Clearly there are things we have to learn from this,"" Baird told reporters.

Jemimah Rodrigues after India reach Women's World Cup final: 'Was going through a lot of anxiety'

NEW DELHI: In a performance that instantly drew parallels with current Indian men's cricket team head coach Gautam Gambhir's iconic knock from the 2011 World Cup final, Jemimah Rodrigues produced an innings of pure grit and brilliance to guide India into the ICC Women's World Cup final in Navi Mumbai on Thursday.Wearing the same jersey number 5 and walking in at same number three, Jemimah anchored India's record-breaking chase with an unbeaten 127 off 134 balls — an effort that rekindled memories of Gambhir's 97 against Sri Lanka at the Wankhede fourteen years ago. Back then, Gambhir's innings formed the backbone of India's pursuit of 275 in the men's final; on Thursday, Jemimah's masterclass propelled India past Australia's daunting 338 — the highest successful chase in the history of women's ODIs.The Kolkata Knight Riders' social media team captured the sentiment perfectly, posting a split image of the two heroes with the caption: “No.3s being No.1s in the World Cups.” Both knocks had uncanny similarities — coming at one-down in a high-pressure chase, playing through early setbacks, and shouldering the responsibility with calm determination.Rodrigues became only the second batter to score a century in an ICC Women's World Cup knockout run chase after England's Nat Sciver-Brunt.But unlike Sciver-Brunt's ton in a losing cause in 2022, Jemimah's innings led India to glory.Chasing 339, India were in trouble at 59/2 before Jemimah joined forces with skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (89 off 88 balls). The duo stitched a record 167-run partnership — India's highest in World Cup knockout history — to dismantle Australia's hopes. Cameos from Richa Ghosh (26 off 16) and Amanjot Kaur (15 off 8) sealed a five-wicket win with nine balls to spare.Earlier, Phoebe Litchfield (119) and Ellyse Perry (77) powered Australia to 338, but India's bowlers, led by Shree Charani (2/49) and Deepti Sharma (2/73), ensured the total remained chaseable.Jemimah's calm celebration — hugging her family after the winning runs — summed up the emotion of the moment. Much like Gambhir in 2011, she had scripted a chapter of her own in India's World Cup folklore.",Jemimah Rodrigues produced an innings of pure grit and brilliance to guide India into the ICC Women's World Cup final in Navi Mumbai on Thursday.

Women's World Cup: Greenstone Lobo predicts India's chances

NEW DELHI: Australian captain Alyssa Healy cut an emotional figure as she admitted that this Women's World Cup semifinal was likely her last appearance in the 50-over format, moments after India stunned the defending champions with a record-breaking chase at the DY Patil Stadium on Thursday night.Speaking after the five-wicket defeat, Healy lauded her team's spirit and consistency throughout the tournament but conceded that they failed to seize the key moments that could have swung the match in their favour.“I think everyone contributed beautifully throughout this tournament. That's why it's probably really disappointing to be standing here right now,” Healy said. “We created enough. We created pressure. We created opportunities. We just weren't able to capitalise on them.”When asked about Australia's plans for the next ODI World Cup cycle, Healy's answer came with a bittersweet smile. “I won't be there! Oh, I think that's the beauty of this next cycle. We're going to see that unfold,” she said, confirming her intent to step away from the one-day format. “Obviously, there's a T20 World Cup in the middle of next year, which is going to be really exciting for our group as well.But I think our one-day cricket is probably going to shift a little bit again. ”Healy, one of Australia's modern greats, leaves behind an imposing legacy. In 123 ODIs, she has scored 3,563 runs at an average of 35.98 and a strike rate of 99.72, including seven centuries and 18 fifties. Her current World Cup campaign — 299 runs in five matches at an average of 74.75 with two hundreds — was a reminder of her enduring class.Healy's remarks came after India, powered by Jemimah Rodrigues ' unbeaten 127 and Harmanpreet Kaur 's 89, completed a record chase of 339 to knock out the seven-time champions. Phoebe Litchfield's 119 and Ellyse Perry's 77 had earlier lifted Australia to 338, but it wasn't enough on a night that marked the end of an era — and the beginning of a new one for Australian women's cricket.","Alyssa Healy says this Women's World Cup semifinal was likely her last appearance in the 50-over format.

Women's World Cup: Greenstone Lobo predicts India's chances

NEW DELHI: Former India opener Virender Sehwag could hardly contain his excitement as the Indian women's team pulled off a sensational five-wicket victory over seven-time champions Australia to storm into the Women's World Cup final at DY Patil Stadium on Thursday night.True to his trademark flair, Sehwag took to social media with a message that perfectly captured the nation's mood. “Australia soch rahi thi ek aur semi-final hai, aaram se jeeto aur pahuncho Final – hamari ladkiyon ne socha yeh to mauka hai asli dhamaka karne ka! Saare criticism ko dho daala. Kya khel dikhaya. Proud of our women in blue,” wrote Sehwag, alongside photos of the jubilant celebrations on the field.The “dho daala” moment he referred to summed up India's fearless chase of 339 — the highest successful run chase in Women's World Cup knockout history. Jemimah Rodrigues led the way with a sublime 127 not out off 134 balls, an innings of grace and grit that silenced doubters and ignited a stadium full of belief. Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur added a powerful 89 off 88 balls, the duo scripting a record 167-run stand for the third wicket that turned the tide India's way.Sehwag's words echoed the sentiment of millions who witnessed India's finest-ever World Cup performance. His line — “hamari ladkiyon ne socha yeh to mauka hai asli dhamaka karne ka” — became an instant viral quote, symbolising how the team had taken control of their destiny and smashed all criticism out of the park.Earlier, Phoebe Litchfield's 119 and Ellyse Perry's 77 had powered Australia to 338, but India's chase never lost momentum. Deepti Sharma's quick 24 and Amanjot Kaur's composed finish sealed the win with nine balls to spare.For Sehwag, who has often championed India's fearless brand of cricket, this was another “Sehwag-style” victory — bold, entertaining, and ruthless. Or as he put it simply — “Saare criticism ko dho daala.”",India beat Australia by five wickets to reach Women's World Cup final.

Women's World Cup: Greenstone Lobo predicts India's chances

NEW DELHI: It was a night of tears, faith, and redemption for India batter Jemimah Rodrigues . The 25-year-old batter broke down after her unbeaten 127 helped India script a record WODI chase of 339 against defending champions Australia in the ICC Women’s World Cup semi-final at the DY Patil Stadium on Thursday.“Firstly, I want to thank Jesus, because I couldn't do this on my own. I know he carried me through today,” an emotional Jemimah said after being named Player of the Match. “I want to thank my mom, my dad, my coach, and every single person who just believed in me throughout this time. It was really hard these last four months, but it just feels like a dream and it's not sunk in yet.”Rodrigues revealed that she got to know she would bat at No.3 only moments before walking out.“I actually did not bat at three. I was still at five while taking a shower. And when the discussion was happening, I just told them, let me know. So just before entering in, I got to know I'm batting at three,” she said. “But it was not for me to prove a point. It was just for me to win this match for India because we've always lost in certain situations.And I just wanted to be there to take us through.”Her unbeaten knock, in partnership with captain Harmanpreet Kaur (89), saw India recover from 59/2 to pull off the highest successful chase in Women’s World Cup history. Amanjot Kaur hit the winning boundary as India sealed victory with nine balls and five wickets to spare.“Today was not about my 50 or my 100. Today was about making India win,” Rodrigues said, her voice cracking. “I was not doing well mentally, going through a lot of anxiety. Then being dropped was rather a challenge for me. But I think all I had to do was show up and God just took care of everything.”Talking about the closing moments, she added, “I was very tired. I just kept quoting one scripture from the Bible that said, ‘Just stand still and God will fight for you’. And I just stood there, and He fought for me.”Rodrigues credited her teammates for carrying her through the final phase. “When Harman di came, all we spoke was about one partnership. Richa, Deepti, Amanjot — everyone was encouraging me when I felt I couldn’t carry on. I can’t take credit for anything of this. I know I have done nothing,” she said.As chants of “Jemimah, Jemimah” filled the DY Patil night, the Mumbai girl thanked the crowd for lifting her through every moment.“Navi Mumbai has always been special to me. I would like to thank each and every member who chanted, who shouted, who believed, who cheered. When I was down and out, every run they cheered for pumped me up,” she said.India will now face South Africa in Sunday’s final, a clash that will produce a new Women’s World Cup champion.",India beat Australia by nine wickets in ICC Women's World Cup semi-final.

PANT FACTOR

Brief scores:

BENGALURU: A strong-at-times breeze, moisture in the air and on the pitch and a green surface prompted India ‘A’ skipper Rishabh Pant to opt to bowl in their four-day match against South Africa ‘A’ on Thursday, but the obvious didn’t happen.Rather than the pacers exploiting what appeared to be ideal conditions, it was the spinners who eventually justified Pant’s decision.Barring an early breakthrough from Anshul Kamboj, who had opener Lesego Senokwane (0) caught at first slip by Ayush Mhatre, he and his new-ball partner Khaleel Ahmed toiled for no reward.Not that they were particularly incisive. Khaleel was wayward, banging it in short and helping the batters pick easy boundaries. Eventually, it was the spinners who turned on the heat at the BCCI Centre of Excellence here, with off-spinner Tanush Kotian finishing the day with figures of 4 for 83. The 27-year-old was the key factor in India ‘A’ fight back as the visiting side ended Day 1 of the first four-day game with 299 runs on the board for the loss of nine wickets.In the morning, it didn't take long for South African’s Jordhan Hermann (71) and Zubayr Hamza (66) to feel at ease in seaming conditions.Early in his innings, Jordan feasted on Khaleel’s short deliveries, finding the mid-on boundary with ease. Kamboj was far more difficult to deal with and was treated with respect. Gurnoor Brar, the first-change bowler also kept things tight.Spin was introduced in the 14th over with Manav Suthar coming in. Jordan and Hamza gauged the situation and then continued undeterred. Hamza tackled spin well, using his feet well to blunt sharp turn.After a few tight overs after lunch, Brar secured the much-needed breakthrough when Hamza's attempt at an uppercut was taken by Pant. The second wicket partnership between Jordan and Hamza yielded 130 runs.Visiting skipper Ackerman was done in by spin, with Kotian bowling over the wicket. The batter stepped out and miscued to Suthar at midfield. Jordan's brother Rubin Hermann (54), also helped himself to a half-century before the home team bowlers made the final session count with some quick wickets.Immediately after tea, Suthar struck with Rivaldo Moonswamy, offering an outside edge to Ayush Badoni at first slip.Returning to action after a three-month injury break, Pant showed no signs of discomfort as he kept wickets throughout the day. Looking leaner and fitter, he seemed as agile as always.Incidentally, Ishan Kishan was called up as cover for N Jagadeesan, who had a freak injury on the eve of the match, when a teammate wearing spikes accidentally stepped on his right hand during training.South Africa ‘A’: 299/9 in 85.2 overs (Jordan Hermann 71, Zubayr Hamza 66, Rubin Hermann 54, Tiaan van Subrayen 46; Manav Suthar 2-62, Tanush Kotian 4-83) vs India ‘A’",South Africa ‘A’ ended Day 1 of the first four-day game with 299 runs on the board for the loss of nine wickets.

By abusing their monopoly and preventing new initiatives they have caused substantial damages to numerous clubs, players and other stakeholders across Europe,"" said A22 CEO Bernd Reichart.The court's decision impact remains unclear as it addresses regulations that have been completely revised.""This ruling does not validate the abandoned 'super league' project announced in 2021, nor does it undermine UEFA's current authorisation rules, adopted in 2022 and updated in 2024, which remain fully in force. These rules ensure that any cross-border competitions are assessed on objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate criteria,"" UEFA responded in a statement.""The club announces that it will continue to work for the good of global football and fans, while claiming substantial damages from UEFA,"" Real Madrid declared in their statement, expressing satisfaction with the ruling that confirmed UEFA's serious infringement of European Union's free competition rules through abuse of its dominant position.",Real Madrid and Super League promoters are demanding over $4 billion in compensation from UEFA.

Poll Is Liverpool's season salvageable after the recent defeats? Yes, they can turn it around No, it's too late Maybe, depends on next few games

Liverpool’s season went from bad to worse on Wednesday night as they crashed out of the League Cup following a stunning 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Anfield — their sixth loss in the last seven matches across all competitions.Ismaila Sarr struck twice before halftime and Yeremy Pino added a late third, as Palace inflicted yet another humiliation on Arne Slot’s struggling side. The defeat compounds Liverpool’s growing crisis, coming just days after their 3-2 Premier League loss to Brentford, which further derailed their title defence.Slot’s decision to rest several key players — including Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz — backfired spectacularly. With one eye on crucial fixtures against Aston Villa, Real Madrid and Manchester City, the Dutchman fielded a largely second-string team featuring teenagers Kieran Morrison, Rio Ngumoha and Trey Nyoni.“It’s not Liverpool standards to lose six out of seven,” Slot admitted after the match. “But with the squad we have — maybe 15, 16 fit first-team players — this was the choice I had to make. The schedule is brutal, and next week will be even tougher.”The weakened lineup struggled to keep up with Palace’s intensity. Joe Gomez’s defensive lapse allowed Sarr to open the scoring in the 41st minute, before the Senegalese winger doubled the lead just moments before halftime from Pino’s assist. Substitute Amara Nallo’s late red card only deepened Liverpool’s woes, and Pino’s composed finish in the 88th minute sealed the emphatic win.The result means Palace have now beaten Liverpool three times in 80 days — following their Community Shield shootout win and a 2-1 Premier League victory.Liverpool’s latest defeat leaves Slot under increasing pressure as the club’s season threatens to unravel. With top players out of form, mounting injuries, and growing fan frustration, the next two weeks — featuring clashes against Villa, Madrid and City — could define the fate of his debut campaign.Meanwhile, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle all advanced to the quarter-finals after securing wins in their respective ties.","Liverpool crashed out of the League Cup following a 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace.

Brazilian forward Vinicius Junior has apologised to Real Madrid and its supporters following his angry reaction to being substituted during the side’s 2-1 win over Barcelona in the El Clasico on Sunday.The forward, who was replaced by Rodrygo in the 72nd minute, reacted visibly on the touchline and was seen heading straight down the tunnel after exchanging words with coach Xabi Alonso.

FIFA officially launched the second phase of ticket sales for the 2026 World Cup on Monday, putting another 1 million tickets up for grabs. This new phase marks the opening of a global ticket draw, which will run until 11 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday.A key feature of this round is the domestic exclusivity window for residents of the three host nations — the United States, Canada, and Mexico. During this period, local fans whose entries are selected in the draw will have the first chance to buy single-match tickets for games held in their respective countries.According to Heimo Schirgi, FIFA’s Chief Operating Officer for the tournament, interest in tickets has already been “massive” both globally and within the host nations. “This second phase, with its host country domestic exclusivity time slot, will allow us to say thank you to these local fans, while ensuring global opportunity as well,” Schirgi said.Fans from the three host nations can enter the draw until Friday. Winners will be randomly selected and granted a specific time slot between November 12 and 15 to make their ticket purchases. Notifications will be sent out at least 48 hours in advance.So far, residents of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico have led ticket purchases, followed by fans from England, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Argentina, and France. After the domestic phase ends, more slots will open globally from November 17, with further sales rounds to follow.Over 1 million tickets have already been sold, with fans from 212 countries purchasing seats. Twenty-eight of the 48 teams have qualified so far.Despite the buzz, logistical questions remain, especially around visa requirements for international visitors amid stricter U.S. immigration rules. Earlier this month, an Argentina friendly featuring Lionel Messi had to be shifted from Chicago to Fort Lauderdale due to slow ticket sales, which some linked to visa concerns.The 2026 World Cup, set across 16 venues in North America, will feature 104 matches and an estimated 7.1 million available seats. While FIFA hasn’t disclosed how many will be released to the public, base ticket prices started at $60 for select games, with premium seats — such as those for the U.S. opening match in Inglewood — priced between $560 and $2,735.In a first for the World Cup, FIFA will use, meaning ticket costs could rise or fall based on demand — a move that might push prices even higher on resale markets, where some listings have already crossed $60,000.","FIFA officially launched the second phase of ticket sales for the 2026 World Cup on Monday.

Lamine Yamal, returning from a groin injury, struggled to influence the game, sending a long-range effort well over the bar in the second half.Madrid maintained control in the closing stages, bringing on Rodrygo and Brahim Diaz, while Barcelona had few attacking options.Even a late effort from Ronald Araujo, pushed forward as a makeshift striker, failed to threaten Thibaut Courtois.Tensions boiled over in the final moments, with Pedri sent off for a second yellow card after a late foul on Aurelien Tchouameni.A brief sideline clash followed, with players from both sides involved after the final whistle.The win marks Madrid’s ninth victory in ten league games this season and highlighted their ability to perform in high-pressure matches, while Barcelona continue to manage squad limitations under Marcus Sorg, standing in for suspended coach Hansi Flick.",Real Madrid defeated Barcelona 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabéu on Sunday.

Scott Woodward’s exit follows political pressure and football turmoil



Verge Ausberry takes charge as LSU eyes stability



Scott Woodward has resigned as LSU’s athletic director — just four days after the university fired head football coach Brian Kelly . The power corridors of LSU are thus buzzing again, and this time it’s not about a big game or a national title. The announcement on Thursday night marks another major leadership shake-up for one of college sports’ most storied programs.Scott Woodward’s resignation did not come as a surprise to many within LSU circles. The university confirmed that Verge Ausberry, the executive deputy athletic director, will serve as the interim athletic director. “We thank Scott for the last six years of service as athletic director,” said Scott Ballard, LSU’s Board of Supervisors Chair. “He had a lot of success at LSU, and we wish him nothing but the best in the future. Our focus now is on moving the athletic department forward and best positioning LSU to achieve its full potential.”Woodward, a Baton Rouge native and LSU alumnus, took charge of the athletic department in 2019. His tenure brought national success, including a football championship and landmark hires such as Kim Mulkey for women’s basketball and Jay Johnson for baseball—both of whom delivered national titles.However, his decision to bring in Brian Kelly in 2021 turned controversial after LSU owed the coach an enormous $54 million buyout upon his firing last week.The fallout from that decision drew sharp criticism from Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, who said bluntly that Woodward would not be involved in hiring the next coach. “There’s a number of bad contracts that seem to have followed Scott Woodward,” Landry remarked on The Pat McAfee Show. He later added, “I can tell you right now, Scott Woodward is not selecting the next head coach. Hell, I’ll let Donald Trump select it before I let him do it. ”Landry’s repeated public criticism made Woodward’s exit seem inevitable. According to reports, he is expected to receive over $6 million owed on his contract.Stepping into the leadership vacuum, Verge Ausberry — a former LSU linebacker and lifelong Tiger — vowed to steer the department through this pivotal phase. “I’m honored for the Board of Supervisors and university leadership to put their trust in me to serve the university in this role,” Ausberry said. “It’s my responsibility to move this athletic department forward, including hiring the best football coach in America to lead our program. ”As LSU begins its search for both a new head football coach and a permanent athletic director, the university faces one of its biggest crossroads in recent memory. Scott Woodward’s departure marks the end of an era defined by ambition, achievement, and controversy — a combination that has left the LSU community both proud and divided.Also Read: “We would love to but..."": Tua Tagovailoa’s wife Annah opens up about her future family plans with Dolphins QB in heartfelt message","Scott Woodward resigns as LSU's athletic director.

This is where both of my kids were born, where we are going to raise my family, with me and Annah. This is the city that chose me to be their quarterback. I’m very grateful, honored for that.”While Tua has thrown for 1,518 yards and 15 touchdowns this season, his league-leading 10 interceptions have drawn criticism. Still, head coach Mike McDaniel reaffirmed his trust in him over rookie Quinn Ewers. Away from the spotlight, however, Tagovailoa’s world is defined by something much more stable — his marriage to Annah.The couple tied the knot in a private ceremony in July 2022 after years of keeping their relationship low-profile. A year later, Tua opened up in a rare public moment. “Never one to put my private life out there,” he shared in a since-deleted Instagram post, according to People. “But this one deserved a post. Happy 1 Year Anniversary to my beautiful wife. I love you.”Tua and Annah now share two children, a boy and a girl, though they’ve kept their family life away from social media. Fans caught a rare glimpse of them in a Dolphins post celebrating Tua’s massive four-year, $212 million contract extension in 2024.Also Read: ""I don’t love the term ‘replace’"": Shae Cornette reveals her true feelings about replacing Molly Qerim after the unexpected ‘First Take’ shake-up","Tua Tagovailoa and wife Annah have two children, a boy and a girl.

Shae Cornette opens up about replacing Molly Qerim



The pressure of leading ESPN’s biggest talk show



Molly Qerim's next move after her controversial First Take departure has fans waiting with bated breath. Even her minor appearances at her alma mater, UConn, are drawing attention. But all eyes are now on Shae Cornette, the woman stepping into one of ESPN’s most high-pressure roles. With First Take being a cornerstone of the network’s non-sports programming, expectations couldn’t be higher.Shae Cornette, 39, officially addressed her new role for the first time ahead of her debut as First Take’s permanent host next Monday. Speaking to the New York Post, the former SportsCenter anchor acknowledged the challenge before her. Cornette, who joined ESPN in 2020 after her husband, basketball analyst Jordan Cornette, encouraged the network to give her a chance, expressed genuine admiration for Qerim.She recalled their brief encounters warmly, noting that Qerim was “always so kind and so sweet.” Cornette also praised her predecessor’s professionalism and composure, saying Qerim handled the show with “grace.” But her most telling words came next.“There’s a reason this was a coveted job,” Cornette said. “And I think it’s because she made it look so eﬀortless. I applaud her for that. I don’t love the term ‘replace’ … This is kind of like a new generation of First Take. I’m just going to call it [that]. But that’s not because of anything with her. It’s just something for me. And I hope that her and I cross paths soon.”Despite Cornette’s modest framing, there’s no denying she is replacing Molly Qerim. Viewers and media analysts will scrutinize her every move in the coming weeks, especially given how publicly Qerim’s exit unfolded. ESPN’s president of content, Burke Magnus, didn’t exactly part ways with her on the friendliest terms, leaving the network eager for a fresh start.At the heart of First Take remains Stephen A. Smith — the $105 million personality who dominates the show’s orbit. For Cornette, success depends on building the kind of chemistry Smith and Qerim shared for nearly a decade. Everything else, as insiders say, will follow — including whatever “new generation” Cornette envisions for the show’s future.Also Read: Who is Mark Andrews’ girlfriend?

"Is Tyreek Hill’s season officially over? Inside the injury, surgery, and uncertain future with the Miami Dolphins",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-tyreek-hills-season-officially-over-inside-the-injury-surgery-and-uncertain-future-with-the-miami-dolphins/articleshow/124976459.cms,"Miami Dolphins' star receiver Tyreek Hill faces a season-ending knee injury, potentially sidelining him until 2026. Torn ligaments require surgery, casting doubt on his future with the team. League sources suggest Miami might release him due to his contract and ongoing domestic violence allegations. Hill's recovery and NFL standing are now uncertain.

Inside the injury: Multiple torn ligaments and a long road to recovery



Could this mark the end of Tyreek Hill’s time in Miami?

The Miami Dolphins have taken a massive hit to their offense after star wide receiver Tyreek Hill suffered what appears to be a season-ending injury. The electrifying playmaker, known for his speed and game-breaking ability, sustained a dislocated knee during the team’s Week 4 matchup against the New York Jets — an injury that could sideline him for much longer than initially feared.According to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport, Hill’s knee injury turned out to be far more severe than first expected. Alongside the dislocation, he reportedly tore multiple ligaments, requiring immediate surgery. That combination means Hill is now expected to miss the remainder of the 2025 NFL season, and his availability for the start of 2026 is also in doubt.Hill’s agent, Drew Rosenhaus, later confirmed that the wideout has undergone surgery and remains optimistic about recovery, explaining that “everything was done with one procedure” and emphasizing that the focus is now on getting him ready for 2026. Still, a full return to elite form after such a complex injury is no guarantee, especially for a player whose success depends heavily on speed and agility.Beyond his injury, Hill’s future with the Dolphins has become increasingly uncertain. CBS Sports’ Jonathan Jones reported that league sources expect Miami to release the five-time All-Pro before the start of the next league year in March 2026. Hill is currently in the second year of a three-year contract extension, but his massive cap hit and recovery timeline could make him a tough retention for Miami’s front office.Complicating matters further, the NFL is reportedly still investigating domestic violence allegations made by Hill’s estranged wife, Keeta Vaccaro. That ongoing inquiry could impact his standing with the league and any potential suitors in free agency.For now, the Dolphins will have to adjust without one of their most dangerous weapons, while Hill faces an uphill battle, both on the road to physical recovery and in proving his place in the NFL once again.Also Read: Did Erika Kirk really turn down Taylor Swift’s $60 million offer to join Super Bowl’s rival All-American Halftime Show?","Tyreek Hill suffered a dislocated knee during the Miami Dolphins' game against the New York Jets.

Before becoming one of the NBA’s most beloved power couples, Ayesha and Stephen Curry shared an innocent beginning that could’ve easily remained a friendship. In a candid reflection, Ayesha revealed that when the two reconnected as teenagers, she wasn’t sure if Stephen saw her as more than a friend. What began as a casual chat on Facebook soon turned into their very first date. Ayesha still remembers her romance story vividly.Ayesha Curry grew up in Markham, Ontario, Canada, before moving to North Carolina at 14, where she first met a young Stephen Curry through church. “He’s one of the first people that I met in the States, but we were just friends,” she recalled in her appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast. They attended the same church and shared mutual friends, but romance wasn’t on her radar. “Obviously, we were 14, right?” she laughed, describing how their connection began in the most ordinary way.Years later, when Ayesha had moved to Los Angeles, Stephen reached out unexpectedly via Facebook. “It was a private message, but he was like, ‘Hey, do you still live in LA?’” she shared. Before that, he had messaged her after seeing her appear in a music video. “He was like, ‘Hey, who is that in the picture you’re in?’ And I’m like, ‘Oh, it’s Young Berg.’And he goes, ‘Oh, I should have known. He always has all the sexy ladies. ’ And I was like, ‘What is happening right now?’”At the time, Stephen was in LA for a basketball camp and asked if she wanted to hang out. Though she declined at first because of work and tight finances, he didn’t give up. “He hit me up two weeks later. We hung out, and we’ve literally been together since that day,” Ayesha said.Ayesha described their first date as something straight out of a coming-of-age movie. “It was like my first real date, so I was just nervous,” she admitted. “It was years of having a crush and then years like I just never thought that he would like someone like me. I thought friends. Just friends.”Their date took them through Hollywood Boulevard, where they placed their hands in Marilyn Monroe’s handprints, grabbed chai lattes, wandered The Grove, and even joked about checking police cars for donuts. “It was one of the best days of my life,” Ayesha recalled. “Honestly, it was so innocent and young, and I wish I could relive that or at least watch it from like a bird’s-eye view. It was so cute.”The pair got married in July 30, 2011 and has been an NBA power couple since. They share four children, daughters Riley and Ryan, and sons Canon and Caius.Also Read: ""He called me crying"": Stephen Curry's wife Ayesha Curry opens up about a heartbreaking moment in their lives amid her recent controversial remarks","Ayesha Curry recalled how Stephen Curry reentered her life after years apart.

Is Giannis Antetokounmpo alright? Milwaukee Bucks forced to rest their star player,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/is-giannis-antetokounmpo-alright-milwaukee-bucks-forced-to-rest-their-star-player/articleshow/124980408.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Giannis Antetokounmpo’s knee trouble began during Milwaukee Bucks’ win over New York Knicks

Milwaukee Bucks stay careful as Doc Rivers addresses Giannis Antetokounmpo’s injury status

Giannis Antetokounmpo’s absence forces the Milwaukee Bucks to rethink spacing and defense

Giannis Antetokounmpo seemed unbeatable against the Knicks until an awkward landing changed everything. In the fourth quarter, he reached for his knee, and the celebration quickly turned into concern. It was a minor gesture, but serious enough to raise some eyebrows. Ever since, the lack of information about his status has been louder than any updates from the Milwaukee Bucks.The knee problem goes back to the Bucks' last game against the New York Knicks on Tuesday, October 28, 2025, at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee. In the final minutes of the fourth quarter, while the Bucks were clinching a tough win, Antetokounmpo bumped into a Knicks defender close to the basket. He was spotted holding his left knee in clear pain as he tried to rise, which is unusual for the 6-foot-11 forward famous for his nonstop energy.This strain occurred in the last moments of the game as Milwaukee clinched the win. Antetokounmpo ended that game with his standard stat line, but the tweak was enough to raise a flag for the team. The Bucks' official injury report for the Warriors game, released on Wednesday, October 29, indicated he was probable with left knee soreness.He even joined in on the pre-game warmups on Thursday, checking out the knee before the final decision was made.The Milwaukee Bucks' communications team announced the update through their official X (formerly Twitter) account: ""Injury Report - Oct. 30 vs. Golden State: Probable: Giannis Antetokounmpo (Left Knee Soreness)."" However, about an hour before the 8 p.m. ET start, they downgraded him to out, highlighting the need for caution.Head coach Doc Rivers talked about Antetokounmpo's situation earlier today during a media session in Milwaukee. While chatting with reporters before the Warriors game, Rivers mentioned, ""I think he's going but I really don't know yet."" He had earlier told the same group that Antetokounmpo would go with the team to the arena, but he stressed that it was unclear if he would actually play.Rivers' remarks showed he had been monitoring the situation all day, as the Bucks tried to balance Antetokounmpo's health with the crucial game against a Warriors team that was strengthened by Stephen Curry's return from injury.With Antetokounmpo out, the Bucks relied on Damian Lillard and Khris Middleton to step up against Golden State. The Warriors, who were already without De'Anthony Melton recovering from an ACL injury, still had a dangerous edge thanks to Curry's shooting skills. Milwaukee's bench was put to the test, as players like Bobby Portis and Taurean Prince got more playing time—something fantasy basketball experts pointed out could benefit those role players.The Bucks came into the game with a 3-0 record, riding high on Antetokounmpo's impressive performance. His absence threw a wrench in that flow, making the team rethink their offensive spacing and defensive strategies. In the long run, this might put a strain on the team's early-season momentum in the competitive Eastern Conference, where every victory is crucial for playoff positioning.With 78 games remaining, Milwaukee's bench should keep things steady while their star recovers. Make sure to watch for official updates from the team; Antetokounmpo's comeback is eagerly awaited by a squad looking for another deep playoff journey.Also Read: “If you can play, play” — Carmelo Anthony sides with Michael Jordan and calls out modern NBA stars for hiding behind load management","Giannis Antetokounmpo's knee trouble began during Milwaukee Bucks’ win over New York Knicks on October 28, 2025.

What is LaMelo Ball’s net worth in 2025?

LaMelo Ball’s endorsement deals and other income



LaMelo Ball’s rise from a teenage sensation to one of the NBA’s most marketable stars is remarkable. As of 2025, the Charlotte Hornets guard has built a financial empire that stretches far beyond the court. From his record-setting rookie contract and massive endorsement deals to a growing portfolio of assets, Ball has turned his early fame into lasting wealth while continuing to prove himself as a franchise standout.As of 2025, LaMelo Ball’s estimated net worth stands at $40 million, according to multiple Celebrity Net Worth. The bulk of his wealth stems from his lucrative NBA contracts, especially his five-year, $260 million rookie max extension with the Charlotte Hornets signed in July 2023. The deal confirmed Ball’s status as one of the league’s premier young guards and a long-term investment for the Hornets’ future.Ball’s journey to the NBA was as unconventional as it was fascinating. Born in Chino Hills, California, on August 22, 2001, he captured national attention as a freshman at Chino Hills High School, helping his team to a perfect 35–0 record.Ball’s scoring flair earned him the MaxPreps National Freshman of the Year honor.After high school, Ball bypassed the traditional college route, opting instead to play professionally overseas in Lithuania and later in Australia’s NBL with the Illawarra Hawks, where he averaged 17.0 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game. His strong international showing led the Charlotte Hornets to select him with the third overall pick in the 2020 NBA Draft.Ball quickly lived up to the hype, earning Rookie of the Year honors in 2021. Despite dealing with injuries in subsequent seasons, his production continued to climb, including a career-best 29.7 points per game in 2024–25, reinforcing his value to Charlotte’s rebuilding project.Off the court, LaMelo Ball’s endorsement portfolio has played a major role in his wealth. Before even stepping onto an NBA floor, Ball signed a $100 million long-term shoe deal with Puma, making him the only rookie from his 2020 draft class to land such a major sneaker contract before the season began. The partnership produced his signature “MB.01” line, which became one of the best-selling performance shoes among young fans.Earlier in his career, Ball was also associated with his father’s Big Baller Brand, releasing the “MB1” sneaker during his teenage years. In addition to Puma, Ball has collaborated with several lifestyle brands and continues to invest in personal ventures and real estate.Also Read: LeBron James teases thrilling new venture that blends nostalgia, imagination, and a hint of Halloween mystery","As of 2025, LaMelo Ball’s estimated net worth stands at $40 million, according to multiple Celebrity Net Worth.

LaMelo Ball Injury Report vs Orlando Magic (October 30, 2025)

Why LaMelo Ball’s Presence Matters for the Charlotte Hornets

LaMelo Ball's Recent Incident and Continued Focus

Charlotte Hornets Supporting Cast and Team Outlook

is officially set to play tonight for the Charlotte Hornets as they take on the Orlando Magic on October 30, 2025, at the Spectrum Center. The star guard has been cleared to return to action and is expected to lead Charlotte’s offense in what promises to be an important matchup for the team. Despite recently being fined for an on-court gesture, Ball remains the Hornets’ driving force and centerpiece this season.According to the latest injury report, LaMelo Ball is fully available for tonight’s contest against the Magic, showing no lingering effects from the mild knee contusion that kept him out during the preseason. Since returning, he has been in excellent form, averaging roughly 26 points, 8 rebounds, and 9 assists per game while maintaining elite playmaking efficiency. His recent triple-double performance underscored his all-around brilliance and leadership on the floor.The Hornets, however, are dealing with several notable absences that will test their depth. Rising star Brandon Miller remains sidelined with a left shoulder subluxation and is expected to miss several more weeks. Josh Green continues to recover from left shoulder surgery, while Grant Williams is still rehabbing from right knee surgery.These injuries put even more responsibility on Ball to carry the offensive load and set the tempo for Charlotte’s attack.Ball’s presence couldn’t come at a better time. The Charlotte Hornets are looking to bounce back from a tough loss to the Miami Heat and need their star guard to orchestrate the offense effectively. His creativity, court vision, and dynamic ball-handling have been crucial to Charlotte’s improvement this season. The team’s offensive efficiency has risen notably compared to last year, largely because of Ball’s ability to create scoring opportunities for himself and his teammates.The matchup against Orlando holds added importance, as the Magic have struggled to find consistency this season. With several players on their own injury list, the Magic present an opportunity for Charlotte to secure a home win. Ball’s ability to control the pace and impact every area of the game - scoring, rebounding, and facilitating - will be vital to the Hornets’ chances tonight.Earlier this week, LaMelo Ball was fined $35,000 by the NBA for making an obscene gesture during a game against the Heat. The incident reflected his fiery competitiveness, though it has done little to distract him from his on-court performance. Ball has remained composed and focused, continuing to put up impressive numbers and displaying leadership qualities that anchor the young Hornets roster.Despite the fine, Ball’s commitment to winning is clear. He remains the emotional and tactical leader of the team, consistently energizing his teammates and fans alike.

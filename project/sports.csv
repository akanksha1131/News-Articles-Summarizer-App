NEW DELHI: The wait is finally over. India men's senior selection committee chaired by Ajit Agarkar will pick India's provisional squad for the upcoming Champions Trophy tomorrow (January 18) in Mumbai and they are set to face a happy headache while doing the same. While top-order is more or less clear, they need to find the right pieces for the middle-order puzzle. There are plenty of players in the mix for those 3-4 positions but Shreyas Iyer remains a no-brainer for the middle-overs period.With the right mix of caution and aggression, he has aced the 50-over game in the past and had a stellar 2023 ODI World Cup where he amassed 530 runs in 11 innings. The runs came at a healthy strike-rate and he hit two hundreds and three half-centuries during India's campaign. The right-hander had a turbulent little period where he lost out on an annual contract but bounced back in emphatic fashion during the IPL where he led KKR to the title.There were three ordinary outings against Sri Lanka in the ODIs but he rediscovered the touch during the domestic season where he made substantial contributions, across formats, for Mumbai. 452 runs in five First Class innings were followed by 345 runs in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and 325 runs in five List A fixtures. He has the weight of runs behind him but more importantly has the game suited for the surfaces in Dubai. With spin expected to play a major role in the tournament, Iyer has what it takes to control the middle period of the game like he did during the 2023 ODI World Cup.He has time and again reiterated that he is not fussy about batting positions and that flexibility will certainly come good. The England ODIs will definitely help coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma to finalise composition of their middle-order, and it will make a lot of sense if it revolves around Iyer.Yes, there are plenty of right-handers in the middle-order mix at the moment but India do have some flexible left-handers in the lower-order who they can seamlessly move around as per the match situation. Those movements were on display during the three ODIs vs Sri Lanka and it could well continue in the upcoming ODI assignments.Axar Patel or Ravindra Jadeja? Or both?India picked both the left-arm spin all-rounders for the T20 World Cup but only Axar played the Sri Lanka ODIs as Jadeja was rested. The selectors now need to take that tough call because Axar did exceedingly well in the T20 World Cup and looked good in the ODIs vs Sri Lanka too. Jadeja, on the other hand, last played an ODI back in November 2023.It now remains to be seen whether the management moves on from Jadeja or carries both. It will be very difficult to ignore Axar because he lends a lot of balance to the Playing XI with his all-round abilities.All the questions will be answered in a few hours' time as the men who matter will get in a huddle to pick the squad for the multi-nation tournament.",India men's senior selection committee will pick provisional squad for Champions Trophy.

Numbers elicit praise from likes of Sachin

NAGPUR: Ironic as it may sound, the buzzword in Indian cricket over the past weeks has been a non-cricketing term - PR. Fan wars on social media, ignited by the debacle in Australia, sparked debates on 'paid news' versus authenticity.With the debate still raging, a post on X went viral on social media on Thursday evening."" Karun Nair has a serious shot at making it to the Indian team if he can afford hiring a PR agency for a while,"" said the post.The witty remark struck a chord, highlighting the one element missing in Nair's arsenal - a robust social media presence. But in the Vijay Hazare Trophy , it wasn't PR that spoke for him; it was his bat, loud and clear.A total of 752 runs, at an unbelievable average of 752 was enough for Nair to trend on X. Social media has been abuzz, with many urging Indian selectors to draft Nair into the Indian squad for the forthcoming England ODI series and the Champions Trophy scheduled in Pakistan and Dubai.With an unstoppable 88* off just 44 balls on Thursday, Nair, who had been knocking on the selectors' door, almost broke it in the semifinal. Coming in to bat in the 35th over, the Vidarbha skipper unleashed his magic in the final 15 balls he played in the match, stacking up 55* runs. His ball-by-ball figures read 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 6, 6, 1, 6, 4, 0, 6, 4, 4, 6. He hit boundaries for fun and toyed with the field at will.Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar lauded Nair's run on Friday. ""Scoring 752 runs in 7 innings with 5 centuries is nothing short of extraordinary, @karun126. Performances like these don't just happen, they come from immense focus and hard work. Keep going strong and make every opportunity count,"" he posted on X.Former Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh too was vocal on his Youtube channel, questioning the double standards of selectors. ""Different rules for different people… that shouldn't be the way. When Nair is scoring runs, you need to play him, right? He doesn't have tattoos, doesn't wear fancy clothes, is that the reason you're not picking him? Does he not work hard,"" he said.Some also drew comparisons of Nair's purple patch with that of VVS Laxman before the stylish batsman was re-drafted in the Indian squad. ""When Laxman made a comeback into the Indian team, he made a big statement with 1,400-odd runs. Nair's stupendous show should be enough for him to launch his comeback,"" a post read.Nair's super show has rewritten history books too. He now tops the list of most runs as a captain in the Vijay Hazare trophy. He is also set to finish as batsman with highest average in Vijay Hazare history.Prior to being dismissed for 112 against Uttar Pradesh, Nair had set a new List A record of scoring 542 runs without being dismissed, going past former New Zealand allrounder James Franklin","Vidarbha batsman Karun Nair scores 752 runs at an average of 752 in Vijay Hazare Trophy.

NEW DELHI: The Sunrisers Eastern Cape secured a commanding 58-run bonus point win against Durban's Super Giants at Kingsmead, marking their return to form.Following three consecutive losses, the defending champions were keen to revive their Season 3 campaign.After winning the toss, captain Aiden Markram 's decision to bat first proved successful as his team delivered an enhanced batting display.Zak Crawley from England set the initial pace with 34 runs from 29 balls, while his compatriot Tom Abell contributed a vital 57 runs from 39 deliveries, including five boundaries.Marco Jansen continued his good form, scoring an unbeaten 36 from 26 balls. He formed an effective partnership with Tristan Stubbs, who scored 15 not out from eight balls, helping the Sunrisers reach 165/5.Noor Ahmad emerged as the Super Giants' best bowler, securing impressive figures of 4/24.The Super Giants began well, with openers Bryce Parsons and Matthew Breetzke establishing a 40-run opening partnership.Their progress was halted when a poor communication led to Parsons being run out for 23 runs from 21 balls.This proved to be a turning point, as left-arm spinner Liam Dawson effectively exploited the spin-friendly Kingsmead pitch.Dawson demonstrated his skill by dismissing Kane Williamson (3) and Breetzke (21), finishing with figures of 2/18 in his four-over spell.Simon Harmer supported well, claiming the crucial wicket of Season MVP Heinrich Klaasen for just one run.Despite some dropped catches, the Sunrisers' bowling unit performed excellently, with Richard Gleeson and Ottneil Baartman each taking 2/17, restricting the Super Giants to 107.The teams will meet again at St George's Park on Sunday.","The Sunrisers Eastern Cape secured a commanding 58-run bonus point win against Durban's Super Giants at Kingsmead.

NEW DELHI: With the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) rolling out guidelines for players to bring discipline and unity in Team India on the back of a horrid Test season, it is carefully navigating around the restriction of personal chefs on long tours.TOI understands the board has offered to send two personal chefs for the entire team on tours. However, it is deliberated if that will suffice for the players who have varied diets charted out for them.""The team has been given an option where the board will arrange two chefs for the players' needs. However, there will be discussions around the specific needs of the players and what more can be done,"" a BCCI source told TOI.Over the last six-seven years, more players have started to pay for personal chefs who provide food on tours according to the diet charted out by their nutritionists. Players have become more conscious about their diet to maintain optimum fitness levels.Usually, these chefs don't stay in team hotels. The players arrange their accommodation with kitchen facilities along with their travel. The food is delivered to the players at the team hotel. One of the objections raised with the board is that the chefs are often present in the dining area where no one except the players and coaching staff are allowed. ""The issue is whether two chefs can cook personalised meals for so many players. The players have their favourite food and recipes that complement each other according to the suggested diet. Some may miss home-cooked food on long tours and the chefs design the menu accordingly,"" the source said.""Certain players have to be extra careful with their diet, especially if they have overcome serious injuries which command watching their weight and other vitals. These chefs are very particular about the quality of ingredients used in cooking the meals. BCCI is trying to work around it to ensure premium food quality for its players,"" the source added.While releasing the list of guidelines, the BCCI has also offered a provision where an exception can be made if the player acquires necessary approvals from the coach, captain and board.One of the options mooted is that a personal chef can deliver the food a t the team hotel concierge services and the concerned player can pick it up and get it served by the hotel staff itself.It will be interesting how much the BCCI is willing to bend to cater to the players' nutritional needs.Certain players have to be extra careful with their diet, especially if they have overcome serious injuries which command watching their weight and other vitals.

NEW DELHI: Avishka Fernando lit up the Sharjah Cricket Stadium with an astonishing knock, steering the Sharjah Warriorz to a record-breaking chase in ILT20 history. Pursuing a daunting 202-run target set by the Dubai Capitals , Fernando smashed a breathtaking 81 off just 27 balls, reaching his fifty in a tournament-record 16 balls.Fernando’s explosive innings, studded with eight towering sixes and six boundaries, powered the Warriorz to victory in 18.1 overs with five wickets to spare. Earlier, Shai Hope played a pivotal role for the Capitals, anchoring their innings with a commanding 83 to help post 201/5.Chasing the steep target, Johnson Charles gave the Warriorz a flying start. Partnering with Jason Roy, Charles hammered 37 off 19 balls, including three sixes and three fours. His blitz ended in the powerplay’s final over, falling to Olly Stone as the Warriorz reached 56/1.Jason Roy followed soon after, dismissed for 26 in the seventh over by Dushmantha Chameera. Avishka Fernando then entered the fray, taking charge in the ninth over with a flurry of boundaries off Gulbadin Naib .

The wicket was great to bat on, and when they scored 200, I knew I had to play positively. It came naturally, and I'm grateful for that. I didn’t realize I had broken the record for the fastest fifty, but I’m happy with the performance.""Dubai Capitals captain, Sikandar Raza, commented: ""I thought it was a very good total. You don’t usually see 202 in Sharjah, so I was pretty confident it was a strong score, and we should have been able to win the game. Shai has been a fantastic addition to the team, and hopefully, the other players around him step up as well. The wicket got better later, and the dew made it tougher.

NEW DELHI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) on Thursday introduced strict new norms for players aimed at fostering discipline, unity and a positive team environment, while upholding professional standards and ensuring operational efficiency during tours and series.By promoting unity and enhancing operational efficiency, the BCCI aims to cultivate an environment that enables players to excel and reach their full potential.The decision comes on the back of Team India ’s dismal show in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia and a 3-0 series whitewash at home against New Zealand.Participation in Domestic Matches is mandatory for players to remain eligible for selection in the national team and for central contracts, as per BCCI guidelines. This policy ensures that players remain connected to the domestic cricket ecosystem, fostering talent development, maintaining match fitness, and strengthening the overall domestic structure. It also inspires emerging players by providing them opportunities to compete alongside top cricketers, ensuring continuity in talent progression. Any exceptions to this mandate will be considered only under extraordinary circumstances and will require formal notification and approval from the Chairman of the Selection Committee, ensuring fairness and transparency in the process.Players Traveling Separately with Families All players are expected to travel with the team to and from matches and practice sessions. Separate travel arrangements with families are discouraged to maintain discipline and team cohesion. Exceptions, if any, must be pre-approved by the Head Coach and Chairman of the Selection Committee.Excess Baggage Limit Players are required to adhere to the specified baggage limits shared with the team. Any excess baggage costs will need to be borne by the individual player. This policy helps streamline logistics and avoid unnecessary expenses.Players - 5 pieces (3 suitcases + 2 kit bags) OR upto 150 kgs. Support staff - 2 pieces (2 big + 1 small suitcases) OR upto 80 kgs.Players - 4 pieces (2 suitcases + 2 kit bags) OR upto 120 kgs. Support staff - 2 pieces (2 suitcases) OR upto 60 kgs.Players - 4 pieces (2 suitcases + 2 kit bags) OR upto 120 kgs. Support staff - 2 pieces (2 suitcases) OR upto 60 kgs.Restriction on Individual Staff on Tour/Series Personal staff (e.g., personal managers, chefs, assistants and security) are to be restricted on tours or series unless explicitly approved by the BCCI. This ensures that the focus remains on team operations and minimizes logistical challenges. – this has to be done away with.Sending Bags Separately to the Centre of Excellence Players must coordinate with team management regarding equipment and personal items being sent to the Centre of Excellence, Bengaluru. Any additional costs incurred due to separate arrangements will be the player’s responsibility.Leaving Practice Sessions Early All players are required to stay for the entire duration of scheduled practice sessions and travel together to and from the venue. This rule ensures commitment and fosters a strong work ethic within the team.Personal Shoots During Series/Tour Players are not permitted to engage in personal shoots or endorsements during an ongoing series or tour. This avoids distractions and ensures that the players’ focus remains on cricket and team responsibilities.Family Travel Policy The family travel policy ensures a balance between players’ personal well-being and team commitments:Players absent from India for more than 45 days during overseas tours can be joined by their partners and children (under 18) for one visit per series (format-wise) of up to a two-week period.The BCCI will cover shared accommodation with the player for the Visitors’ Period. All other expenses are to be borne by the player.Visits must be scheduled at a single time during dates agreed upon by the Coach, Captain, and GM Operations.Any deviation from this policy must be pre-approved by the Coach, Captain and GM Operations. Additional expenses outside the visitors’ period will not be covered by the BCCI.Participation in BCCI’s Official Shoots and Functions Players are required to be available for BCCI’s official shoots, promotional activities, and functions. These engagements are essential for maintaining the BCCI’s commitments to stakeholders and promoting the game effectively.Players Returning Home if Matches End Early Players are required to stay with the team until the scheduled end of the match series or tour, regardless of whether matches conclude earlier than planned. This ensures unity, fosters team bonding, and avoids disruption to team dynamics.3All players are expected to adhere strictly to the above guidelines. Any exceptions or deviations must be pre-approved by the Chairman of the Selection Committee and Head Coach. Non-compliance may lead to disciplinary action as deemed appropriate by the BCCI.Additionally, the BCCI reserves the right to take disciplinary action against a player which may include (i) sanction against the concerned player from participating in all BCCI conducted tournaments including the Indian Premier League; and (ii) deduction from retainer amount / match fees under the BCCI Player contract. This measure ensures accountability and reinforces the importance of adhering to established policies and prioritising Indian cricket.",The Board of Control for Cricket in India introduced strict new norms for players.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian football star Neymar jr recently shared his perspective on the dynamics within the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) team during his time there.In a podcast hosted by Romário, a Brazilian World Cup winner, Neymar discussed the impact of Lionel Messi's arrival at the club in August 2021.According to Neymar, his former teammate Kylian Mbappé became ""a little jealous"" after Messi joined the team. Neymar suggested that Mbappé, who has since joined Real Madrid, didn't want to share the spotlight with anyone else, leading to some conflicts and a change in behaviour.“No, he is not. I have my things with him, we had a little fight, but he was fundamental for us when he arrived. I used to call him golden boy. I always played with him, said he was going to be one of the best. I always helped, talked to him, he came to my place, we had dinner together,” Neymar said.Neymar acknowledged that he had a good partnership with Mbappé initially, referring to him as the ""golden boy"" and praising his potential to become one of the best players.“We had some good years of partnership, but after Messi came he was a little jealous. He didn't want to split me with anyone. And then there were some fights, a change in behavior,” the Brazilian further added.While Neymar didn't explicitly name individuals, he mentioned that big egos within the team often hindered their performances in crucial matches.“It is good to have egos, but you have to know that you don't play alone. There needs to be another guy by your side. (Big) egos were almost everywhere, it can't work,” Neymar said. “If nobody runs and nobody helps, it is impossible to win anything.”Neymar also reflected on the possibility of returning to Brazil after his contract with Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia expires later this year.It's worth noting that neither Mbappé nor Messi has responded to Neymar's comments as of now.","Neymar discussed the impact of Lionel Messi's arrival at Paris Saint-Germain.

NEW DELHI: Former Team India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh backed Indian head coach Gautam Gambhir and skipper Rohit Sharma 's leadership skills, despite recent setbacks.Yuvraj expressed his support on Thursday for Rohit's captaincy, emphasising the need to evaluate his overall performance rather than focusing solely on recent series losses.The left-handed batter highlighted Rohit's achievements, including leading India to victories in the T20 World Cup and guiding Mumbai Indians to five IPL titles .""Gautam Gambhir needs to be given more time as he has just come into the system. Rohit won us the T20 World Cup and he was the captain when India reached the World Cup (ODI) final. Mumbai Indians won 5 IPLs under Rohit's captaincy. He stepped down in the last Test (of BGT) to give someone else the chance, how many captains have done that in the past? I look at what he has done in the last 3-5 years, one tournament can't decide. For me, the series defeat at home was more disappointing as India losing 3-0 against New Zealand was tougher,"" Yuvraj told reporters during an event.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy Rohit Sharma's captaincy tenure has been a mix of notable successes and disappointing lows.

NEW DELHI: A couple of days before the national selectors meet to pick the ODI team for the three-match series against England and the ICC Champions Trophy , the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) is planning to probe why Sanju Samson did not participate in the Vijay Hazare Trophy.BCCI top brass and selectors are not happy with Samson's decision to skip the event since they have tried to ensure domestic cricket remains relevant, TOI has learnt.The Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) didn't pick the wicketkeeper after Samson expressed his unavailability for a preparatory camp ahead of the tournament. KCA secretary Vinod S Kumar had stated that the association didn't want a youngster to lose his place due to the uncertainty over Samson's availability.BCCI sources say the matter needs to be discussed before the selectors get down to picking the Champions Trophy squad on Jan 19.""The selectors and the board have been very clear on the importance of domestic cricket. Last year, Ishan Kishan and Shreyas Iyer lost central contracts for missing domestic matches without seeking permission. Even in Samson's case, the board and selectors were not given any reason why he missed the tournament. All that is known so far is that he spends much of his time in Dubai,"" BCCI sources said.Also See: Champions Trophy Fixtures 2025 Samson has been picked for the T20I series at home against England starting next week. However, since the Vijay Hazare Trophy is played in a 50-over format, it becomes a crucial tournament going into the Champions Trophy.""The selectors would want a valid reason. Otherwise, it will be difficult to consider him for the ODI season. Samson has had a bitter history with the KCA, but that needs to be sorted out for him to play in domestic cricket. It can't be that the state association and him have a misunderstanding, and he misses out on game time. He did play in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy preceding the Vijay Hazare Trophy,"" the source said.Samson is considered to be contender for one of the two wicketkeepers' spots along with Rishabh Pant KL Rahul and Dhruv Jurel.

NEW DELHI: Astrologer Greenstone Lobo has predicted a challenging period ahead for Prithvi Shaw , the young Indian cricketer who has been struggling to find consistency in his career.In his special series, 'StarPlay: Cricket & Astrology' for TOI Sports, Lobo shared a detailed picture of Shaw's astrological analysis and what it could mean for the out-of-form cricketer.According to Lobo, Shaw’s planetary alignment indicates hurdles that could test his resolve both on and off the field. Despite his immense talent, the astrologer suggests that Shaw must navigate these turbulent phases with patience, determination, and discipline to rediscover his form.Lobo further explained, ""Shaw was born in the GREY LIZARD patch which was between 1997 to 1999 and he has a decent horoscope with planet Pluto in the GREY LIZARD avatar. Planet X is in exaltation and Planet Y is strongly placed. It's a good chart. He's a Scorpio so the passion and the intensity is definitely intact,"" Lobo explained.""He within his limited capacity on the planet has done very well for himself. In a very short time, you know sometimes what it takes for some people to earn a lifetime's income, he has earned within a very short period of time,"" Lobo added.On the pertinent question of whether he is going to see some kind of a resurrection in his career? Lobo stated, ""It doesn't look like he is going to make a huge comeback, if at all he has any kind of chance to make a comeback, I would say that the possibilities are there in 2026 when Planet Y will become stronger, so in 2026, if he does something interestingly well in the domestic cricket, then probably he may get some sort of a comeback in domestic circuit, but if you're going to talk about the international cricket, I would say that probably the chances are very very low because he will definitely be completely replaced. There is really really no place for him.""Shaw is set to be sidelined for Mumbai's upcoming Ranji Trophy matches, further extending his absence from competitive cricket. The 25-year-old last played in December during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT) but was left out of the Vijay Hazare Trophy squad.Once touted as India’s next big star, Shaw’s career has faced setbacks due to fitness concerns and discipline issues. He last represented India in 2021 and has played five Tests, six ODIs, and one T20I.

Retirement is a personal decision—how long you want to play or how much more you want to contribute is up to the player. Ultimately, though, it’s also up to the selectors—in this case, Mr. Ajit Agarkar and his team,"" said Manjrekar on an episode of 'Deep Point' podcast by Star Sports.Manjrekar also suggested that Virat Kohli should consider playing a season of County cricket in England to improve his Test game ahead of the five-match series in June. He cited Cheteshwar Pujara's example, who benefitted from the the experience of playing in Country cricket.Although the County season clashes with the Indian Premier League (IPL), Kohli could still play red-ball cricket in England, joining the India 'A' squad for the shadow series before the main Test series.Kohli had a disappointing tour of Australia, where he was often dismissed while chasing deliveries outside the off-stump.“Kohli needs to play a lot of red-ball cricket. The first Test in England is in June, while the County Championship begins in April. He could join a County team, like Pujara did, and gain valuable match practice. India can then evaluate his performances in the initial Test matches.”“If there are positive signs, he can continue. But the last thing you want is Kohli going there and struggling, as we’ve seen before. That wouldn’t be good for Indian cricket. Playing County cricket could be a very sensible move for him,” he added.Former RCB head coach and ex-India batting coach Sanjay Bangar too was optimistic about Kohli's future. He believes that Kohli's excellent fitness levels will allow him to play for several more years.“I’m still backing him. Even at 36 (years old), he’s as fit as ever.

NEW DELHI: Saud Shakeel and Mohammad Rizwan staged a crucial recovery for Pakistan on the opening day of the first Test against the West Indies in Multan, guiding their team to 143-4 after a shaky start.The day, curtailed by fog and poor air quality, saw only 41.3 overs bowled, with Pakistan fighting back from 46-4 when the duo came together.Shakeel remained unbeaten on 56, registering his ninth Test half-century, while Rizwan scored 51 not out, marking his 11th fifty in the format. The pair added a vital 97-run partnership to stabilize Pakistan’s innings after early damage inflicted by West Indies pacer Jayden Seales .The home side, aware of the dry and grassless nature of the Multan pitch that promises a tough batting challenge in the later stages, chose to bat first after winning the toss. However, their decision backfired early as Seales exploited the conditions to return impressive figures of 3-21 from 10 overs.Seales struck in the sixth over, inducing an edge from debutant Muhammad Hurraira (6) to wicketkeeper Tevin Imlach. Left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie then removed Shan Masood for 11, courtesy of another catch behind the stumps. Seales continued to trouble the hosts, trapping Kamran Ghulam leg-before for 5 and dismissing Babar Azam (8) with an edge, leaving Pakistan reeling at 46-4.Shakeel and Rizwan, showcasing composure and excellent shot selection, countered the three-spinner attack fielded by the West Indies. Shakeel struck four boundaries in his knock, while Rizwan hit seven. Their left-right combination provided much-needed stability to Pakistan's innings.Earlier, poor visibility caused by fog and low air quality delayed the start of play and wiped out the first session. Both teams opted for spin-heavy bowling lineups, with three spinners each and a solitary frontline pacer.The match is part of the ICC World Test Championship 's third cycle (2023-2025), with Pakistan ranked eighth and the West Indies ninth.

MUMBAI: Battling poor form, senior batsman Rohit Sharma , who led Team India to the final of the 2023 ODI World Cup, is set to continue as India’s ODI captain.This was confirmed when the BCCI announced on Friday that, at 12.30pm on Saturday, Rohit will address a press conference along with chief selector Ajit Agarkar at the BCCI headquarters at the Wankhede Stadium here where the Indian team for the 2025 Champions Trophy in Dubai and Pakistan, which starts from Feb 19 and ends on March 9, and the three-match ODI series at home against England preceding that, will be picked by the national selectors.There was much speculation about Rohit's future in international cricket after he stood down from India's XI in the fifth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy earlier this month in Sydney. However, in an interview to official telecaster, the 37-year-old clarified that the decision shouldn't be misconstrued as a retirement.In the three-Test series at home against New Zealand, all Rohit managed to score was 91 runs in six innings at an abysmal average of 15.16. His slump worsened in the BGT in Australia after that, as all he put together in three Tests (in five innings) was 31 runs@ 6.20. In a bid to rediscover his form, Rohit has even trained at the Wankhede Stadium with the Mumbai team, leading up to the second leg of the Ranji Trophy, even though he hasn’t decided to yet on his participation in Mumbai’s next Ranji match against J&K at the Mumbai Cricket Association’s ground in BKC from Jan 23.Meanwhile, afflicted by a back injury which prevented him from bowling for a major part in the fifth and final Test at Sydney, ace fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah is unlikely to be a part of the 15-man squad for the global tournament, unless the selectors decide to take a chance with him to see if he can indeed recover before the knockouts of the event.Playing all their matches in the eight-team Champions Trophy under a hybrid model in Dubai, launch their campaign against Bangladesh on Feb 20, before taking on arch-rivals Pakistan on Feb 23, and then New Zealand in their final league match on March 2.The ODIs against England are scheduled for Feb 6, 9 and 12.It will be interesting to see if the selectors pick veteran batsman Karun Nair , who has been in sensational form in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, where he has scored 752 runs in just seven innings at an incredible average of 752, with five hundreds-four on the trot, to steer Vidarbha into the VHT final for the first time will be picked for the global tournament.The BCCI and the selectors have emphasized on the importance of domestic cricket in recent times, but it won’t be easy to make space in the ODI team for Nair.“Whom do you drop if you have to pick Karun in the 15? You can't drop someone like Shreyas Iyer, who smashed a century in the 2023 ODI World Cup semifinal at the Wankhede Stadium and has been in fabulous form across formats in domestic cricket. However, there is set to be a deep discussion on Karun,” a source in the BCCI told TOI.India have played just six ODIs since their heart-breaking loss in the ODI World Cup final to Australia in Ahmedabad in Nov 2023, and lost an ODI series 2-1 in Sri Lanka in July last year.","Rohit Sharma set to continue as India’s ODI captain. Sharma stood down from India's XI in the fifth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy earlier this month in Sydney. The BCCI announced on Friday that, at 12.30pm on Saturday, Rohit will address a press conference.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117336311,imgsize-31118,width-400,resizemode-4/117336311.jpg"

David Miller lauds Lhuan-dre Pretorius after Paarl Royals beat MI Cape Town

Dinesh Karthik on Lhuan-dre Pretorius, start for Paarl Royals in SA20

Jasprit Bumrah injury: Where things stand with BOOM!

Lhuan-dre Pretorius may be living life in the fast lane at the Paarl Royals in the SA20 , but the teenager’s dad Abe is still picking up traffic fines.Pretorius has burst on the global cricket scene in spectacular fashion with the former South Africa U-19 star smashing two half-centuries in three matches to top the SA20 run-scorers list.He has surprised many with the maturity he’s shown at the crease.Unfazed at the prospect of facing up to the likes of Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, Marco Jansen and Ottniel Baartman.But Abe Pretorius - Lhuan-dre’s father - claims his son is still just a normal teen finding his way in the world.“I remember when Anrich Nortje bowled to him. He told me an interesting story: ‘Dad, I wasn’t scared of the ball. I was more scared of me running into him because I saw it on TV.’ He was never afraid. Pace never bothered him,” said the senior Pretorius.“But he’s still a baby. He’s only 18. He has a mustache. But his beard is soft. He's still a kid and sometimes I forget.“But he's also not a kid getting all the speed fines. The car is still in my name. It's crazy!”The Pretorius family have certainly been there to support Lhuan-dre and fellow South African schools prodigy Vihan - ‘he’s my baby and can do no wrong’ - cricket aspirations since they first picked up a cricket bat.Abe installed a training net at their home in Potchefstroom early on and since they stayed close to Senwes Park - home of the North West Dragons - would regularly take his sons there to train.Lhuan-dre, therefore, had the privilege of spending time with the likes of SA20 stars Bjorn Fortuin and Rassie van der Dussen from a very young age.“He always wanted to play the game. He was brought up next to the field at Senwes Park. So, I was privileged to have a hospitality suite there. And that’s where he met Bjorn and Rassie.“He always played with them or next to the field to see them playing. And that's what's so nice. He plays now with Bjorn. There's a bit of banter going on between them.”At this critical age parents can often become over-indulged with their children’s sporting careers, forcing them to train when they may no longer enjoy it.Abe was never confronted with this issue.“He lives for cricket. He YouTubes cricket every night. I don’t think he’s watched a cartoon ever in his life. From a young age, before any big game, he would wake me up at five.“And we had a net in our yard at the back. So I needed to throw to him before school. And when he gets picked up and then he's ready in the afternoon.“I think more waking him up for academics. He never wanted to study. That was a headache and we had to get a tutor to assist him.”Whilst it was almost the perfect childhood growing up in Potchefstroom, the major cricket-playing high schools are based in Johannesburg. That’s close to 120 kilometres away.It is common practice for young South African boys to leave their family homes at 12-13 years old after being afforded scholarships to attend these ivy-league schools as hostel boarders.But Abe was having none of it. Instead, he packed up and relocated the entire family to “The Big Smoke” - as Johannesburg is colloquially referred to - for Lhuan-dre to attend the prestigious St Stithians College - alma mater of Kagiso Rabada, Grant Elliot and a certain Kwena Maphaka.The latter is, of course, the same age as Lhuan-dre with their cricket journeys following an almost identical path. They played together at school, youth provincial Lions teams, SA U19, and now at the Royals.And according to Abe, it's Lhuan-dre, who kept wicket for most of this period, that knows how to inspire the tearaway rookie fast bowler.“Lhuan-dre knew just how to switch Kwena on. He would always go up to Kwena and whisper something in his ear, and Kwena would get spitting mad,” he said.“After that, Kwena would run through the teams. There are a lot of video clips of when they were at school together, especially when Lhuan-dre was keeping. They were a mean team.”With Lhuan-dre being a left-handed opening batter that keeps wicket, has Gunn & Moore as his bat sponsor, and also having an aversion to a prospective academic career, the comparisons with Proteas and Durban's Super Giants star Quinton de Kock were inevitable.But according to Abe, Lhuan-dre would not want it any other way, and is looking forward to the Royals’ first clash against the Super Giants at Kingsmead on Thursday, January 23.“He’s had a photo up of Quinny since he was very young. He’s still Quinny’s biggest fan. He simply loved Quinny.“Everything about him is Quinny. Yeah, I think you're going to see when they're going to play each other. It's going to be a challenge. I think he's going to be a star-struck!""Everything is happening at the speed of light for Pretorius right now. If he maintains this early season momentum through SA20 Season 3, it would not be far too to suggest that the powerful left-hander could come into the reckoning as a potential replacement at the Indian Premier League (IPL) in the near future.So, how does a father keep a teenager in check when the whole world suddenly wants to give him everything his heart has always desired?“I'm Afrikaans! That's all. He knows me. I don’t play.“I'm a mining oak and I'm Afrikaans. So, he'll know his way.“That's a cultural thing. He knows how it works. You stay humble.”",Lhuan-dre Pretorius has scored two half-centuries in three matches for the Paarl Royals in the SA20. The 18-year-old has surprised many with the maturity he’s shown at the crease. Abe Pretorius says his son is still a normal teen finding his way in the world.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117332449,imgsize-38972,width-400,resizemode-4/117332449.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Manchester City star Erling Haaland on Friday signed a new contract with the Premier League champions that will keep him at the club until 2034.City announced the nine and a half year extension for the 24-year-old striker, who has netted an impressive 111 goals in 126 matches since his arrival from Borussia Dortmund in 2022.The extension marks the longest contract in the league's history, surpassing the nine-year agreement Cole Palmer signed with Chelsea last year. Haaland’s salary is reportedly set at £500,000 ($610,000) per week.Haaland, who joined City in 2022, made an immediate impact by scoring 52 goals across all competitions in his debut season. His stellar performances helped the club secure a historic treble, winning the Champions League, Premier League, and FA Cup. He continued his remarkable form last season, netting 38 goals and contributing to the team’s fourth consecutive league title.""I am really happy to have signed my new contract and to be able to look forward to spending even more time at this great club,"" said a joyous Haaland.""Manchester City is a special club, full of fantastic people with amazing supporters, and it's the type of environment that helps bring the best out of everybody.""I also want to thank Pep (Guardiola), his coaching staff, my team-mates and everyone at the club as they have all helped me so much in the past couple of years.

NEW DELHI: Amad Diallo's remarkable 12-minute hat-trick rescued Manchester United from a potentially embarrassing defeat against struggling Southampton at Old Trafford on Thursday.The visitors, who are battling to avoid finishing the season as the worst team in Premier League history, took a deserved lead through Manuel Ugarte's own goal late in the first half.Southampton had numerous opportunities to extend their advantage, with Ivan Juric's side playing with confidence and intensity.However, Diallo's introduction in the second half proved to be a game-changer for the hosts.The young forward equalised in the 82nd minute, capitalising on a defensive lapse to score his first goal. Eight minutes later, he latched onto a clever pass from Christian Eriksen to put United ahead.Deep into stoppage time, Diallo completed his hat-trick, taking advantage of another defensive mistake from the visitors.The 3-1 victory provided a much-needed boost for Manchester United, who had endured three consecutive Premier League defeats prior to this match.It also lifted them to 12th in the table, while Southampton remained 10 points adrift of safety.Despite the eventual scoreline, Southampton's performance was commendable, as they caused numerous problems for United's defence throughout the match.Kamaldeen Sulemana was particularly impressive, tormenting the home side's right-back with his pace and trickery.Ruben Amorim's decision to introduce Diallo and make other attacking substitutions proved to be a masterstroke, as the forward's clinical finishing ultimately secured all three points for Manchester United in a match that appeared to be slipping away from them.","Manchester United beat Southampton 3-1 at Old Trafford on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Real Madrid overcame a challenging match against Celta Vigo , initially squandering a two-goal lead but ultimately securing a 5-2 victory after extra time in the Copa del Rey quarter-finals on Thursday.Despite a recent defeat to Barcelona in the Supercopa de España final, Madrid's performance, highlighted by two goals from promising talent Endrick , saw them through after a tense match that extended beyond regular time due to Celta Vigo's late equalizer. Kylian Mbappe 's notable performance included a controversial opening goal, followed by Vinicius contributing to Madrid's lead.However, Celta Vigo's persistence paid off with Jonathan Bamba's late goal and Marcos Alonso 's penalty in stoppage time, pushing the game into extra time.In the additional period, Madrid displayed their offensive strength with Endrick scoring his second, Fede Valverde adding another, and Endrick sealing the win with a backheel goal.""This is Madrid, you fight until the end to win,"" said Endrick. ""We never go down, we're always fighting... it was a tough game, but we got the goals and we won.

""These goals are very important for me, I liked this game, this stadium, these fans, and now we have to train, there's more ahead.""Other Copa del Rey results saw Osasuna and Real Sociedad advancing past Athletic Bilbao and Rayo Vallecano, respectively, while Barcelona and Atletico Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals on Wednesday.","Real Madrid beat Celta Vigo 5-2 after extra time in Copa del Rey quarter-finals.

Barcelona advanced to the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey with a resounding 5-1 victory over Real Betis on Wednesday. The star of the show was 17-year-old Lamine Yamal , who put on a dazzling display at the Olympic Stadium.Gavi opened the scoring for Barcelona early in the match, and the Catalans continued to dominate with goals from Jules Kounde, Raphinha, Ferran Torres, and Yamal himself. The young winger's performance was particularly impressive, as he scored and helped create two more goals.Barcelona's confidence was high coming into the match, having recently won the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia by thrashing Real Madrid. Despite resting key players like Robert Lewandowski, the team's attacking prowess was on full display.Pau Cubarsi, a 17-year-old defender who came through Barcelona's youth academy alongside Yamal, praised his teammate's performance.""I've been enjoying watching him for many years, now the whole world is, and he deserves it all.""Barcelona's dominance was evident from the start, with Dani Olmo, who recently obtained a temporary playing license, starting as a false nine in place of Lewandowski. Olmo was involved in the opening goal and had several chances of his own, hitting the post and firing over.Kounde scored Barcelona's second goal after a sublime pass from Yamal, exploiting the right side of Betis' defense. Although Kounde had a second goal disallowed for a marginal offside, Barcelona continued to create chances.In the second half, Yamal had a goal of his own disallowed for an offside in the build-up, but it didn't matter as Raphinha scored minutes later after another surging run from the young winger. Ferran Torres added a fourth goal, and Yamal finally got on the scoresheet himself with a near-post finish.Betis managed to pull one back from the penalty spot through Vitor Roque, who is on loan from Barcelona, after Kounde fouled Jesus Rodriguez in the area.After the game, Gavi praised Yamal as the best player in the world after Lionel Messi, and coach Hansi Flick also commended the winger's talent.""Gavi's very emotional, so I say also yes (he's the best),"" joked Flick.""You can see it, in great matches you see big talent and he showed it many many times, he's on a good (path).""Yamal, who shone for Spain during their Euro 2024 victory last summer, has an impressive tally of nine goals and 13 assists across all competitions for Barcelona this season.In other Copa del Rey action, Atletico Madrid joined Barcelona in the last eight with a comfortable 4-0 win over second division Elche. This marked Atletico's 15th consecutive victory across all competitions.Atletico coach Diego Simeone rested some of his regular starters, but the team still managed to secure a commanding win. Alexander Sorloth scored twice in the first half, and Elche's chances of a comeback were further diminished when Nico Fernandez was sent off early in the second half.Rodrigo Riquelme and Julian Alvarez added to Atletico's lead, sealing an emphatic victory for the Rojiblancos.The Copa del Rey action continues on Thursday, with defending league champions Real Madrid hosting Celta Vigo and cup holders Athletic Bilbao welcoming Osasuna.","Barcelona defeated Real Betis 5-1 in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday.

London: Arsenal reignited their Premier League title challenge with a 2-1 victory over Tottenham on Wednesday, while Newcastle secured a spot in the top four thanks to a brace from Alexander Isak.In other matches, David Moyes had a disappointing return to the Everton dugout as his team lost 1-0 to Aston Villa at Goodison Park.The win at the Emirates lifts Arsenal to within four points of league leaders Liverpool, who drew 1-1 with Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, and ended a three-match winless run for the Gunners across all competitions.Tottenham took the lead through Son Heung-min in the 25th minute, but Arsenal equalised 15 minutes later when Gabriel's header from a corner deflected off Dominic Solanke for an own goal.Arsenal completed the turnaround just before halftime, with Leandro Trossard blasting a shot past new Spurs goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky.Despite numerous chances to extend their lead, Arsenal failed to do so and had a nervous moment when Pedro Porro hit the post in stoppage time.Arsenal now sits on 43 points after 21 matches, four points behind Liverpool, who have a game in hand.Mikel Arteta, the Arsenal manager, praised his team's performance, calling it ""outstanding.""""We had some big chances and big situations. At the end we had to suffer more than we wanted,"" he told the BBC.""When you have opportunities (to close the gap) you have to take them. We are on a really consistent run in the Premier League. It's about recovery tomorrow and Aston Villa on Saturday, going and going.""The defeat is another setback for injury-plagued Tottenham, who have taken only five points from their last nine Premier League games and have fallen to 13th in the table.Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou was critical of his team's performance, saying, ""Nowhere near good enough, especially in the first half. We were too passive.""Newcastle moved into fourth place, ahead of struggling Chelsea, with a 3-0 victory over Wolves, thanks to a record-chasing performance from Isak, who scored for the eighth consecutive league match.Isak's deflected shot off Wolves defender Rayan Ait-Nouri put Newcastle ahead in the 34th minute, and he doubled the lead before the hour mark with his 15th league goal of the season.Anthony Gordon added a third goal for Newcastle.""I feel amazing,"" said Isak, who has Jamie Vardy's record of scoring in 11 straight Premier League games in his sights.""Individually I feel free and confident but looking at the team we are doing so well as well, defending and with threats going forward. It is a team and I have to keep contributing with goals.""At Goodison Park, Ollie Watkins scored the only goal for Aston Villa in the 51st minute, slotting past England teammate Jordan Pickford after being sent through by Morgan Rogers.Despite their efforts, Everton lacked creativity, which is unsurprising for a team that has scored only 15 league goals in 20 matches this season.The result lifts Aston Villa to seventh in the table, while Everton remain in deep trouble, just one point above the relegation zone in 16th place.Everton, who have been in the top flight since 1954, have struggled against relegation for the past three seasons and are once again in a perilous position.David Moyes, who enjoyed success during his 11-year stint at Goodison Park from 2002 to 2013, was brought back by Everton's new American owners, the Friedkin Group, after they sacked Sean Dyche last week.""Obviously it's been a bit of a whirlwind,"" Moyes said. ""Sean Dyche left a group of players that have great character and a great attitude.""I'm really pleased to take over that. What I need to do is add quality and find a way of getting results but you can't change the whole thing around straight away.""In another match, Leicester suffered their sixth consecutive league defeat, losing 2-0 to Crystal Palace, which leaves them second from bottom in the table.Jean-Philippe Mateta scored for Palace early in the second half, and Marc Guehi secured the points with a late second goal.","Arsenal beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 to move within four points of Premier League leaders Liverpool.

NEW DELHI: As they say, there is no dull day in Indian football. The latest drama is taking place at Mohammedan SC . Reports emerged on Tuesday from Kolkata's Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan claiming that Mohammedan players boycotted training ahead of their Indian Super League ( ISL ) home game against Chennaiyin FC , scheduled for January 15. The players were allegedly protesting against three-month unpaid wages.It was further suggested that while the club management had committed to clearing the dues by January 15, players reportedly decided to abstain from training due to a lack of concrete steps from the administration.This news surfaced amid Mohammedan’s resurgence in the ISL, riding on a three-match unbeaten streak. As the team stands second-last on the table, with Hyderabad FC below them, coach Andrey Chernyshov has been working tirelessly to turn their season around.Amid the cub's resurrection, the report of players boycotting training sessions over unpaid dues has raised eyebrows. However, Mohammedan SC have dismissed the rumours.In an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com, Mohammedan SC General Secretary Ishtiaque Ahmed, famously known as Raju around the Maidan region, categorically refuted the claims.""The reports that have come out are all fake and baseless, and they are being fabricated and posted on Facebook. There is no such issue as players not receiving their payments; all players are being paid. If players were not being paid, how would we be signing new players?"" said Ahmed.Despite challenges on the pitch, the Kolkata-based club has been actively reinforcing their squad in recent times. During the current transfer window, MDSC have secured several promising talents, including domestic standouts like Manvir Singh, Mahitosh Roy, Santosh Trophy winner Robi Hansda, and Juwel Ahmed Mazumder.Additionally, foreign signings such as Florent Ogier and Marc Andre Schmerböck have also been added to their ranks. TimesofIndia.com understands that the club is still in pursuit of another striker before the window shuts.Ahmed further clarified the status of training sessions: ""Training is ongoing, and it is happening as usual. All the players are attending the training sessions.""However, addressing the speculation about finances, Ahmed explained recent changes in the club’s payment structure: ""Our payment structure has been changed. Previously, we used to make advance payments to the players before the month ended. But now, we need results. It’s not feasible that the investors keep making payments without getting results in return.""The shift in approach extends to the incentive system as well. Ahmed elaborated, ""By structure, we mean the incentive system we had. Previously, we provided incentives to all the players. Now, it has been decided that only players who perform well will receive incentives. The players have also been informed that if they do not perform well, their incentives will be cut.""Not all squad members have been actively participating in the ISL, with some sidelined due to injuries or suspensions. This has naturally influenced the club’s approach toward incentive payments.""Last month, advance payments were not made, but the payments for the previous month have been cleared this month. Previously, we used to make advance payments, but now that is no longer happening.""Perhaps the decision to pay players at the end of the month might serve as a motivating factor to inspire better performance, believes the club secretary.On the other hand, refuting the rumours about players boycotting training, Ahmed clarified, ""All the players are attending training. The reports that are circulating are speculating that players didn’t show up due to financial reasons, but that’s not true. Some players were given rest, and some were dealing with injuries, which is why the coach didn’t include them in practice sessions.""Ahmed also confirmed that there were no hidden financial issues grappling the club: ""There are no financial difficulties. If there were any, we would definitely address them openly. Why wouldn’t we say it?""",Mohammedan SC deny reports of players boycotting training over unpaid wages. Club secretary Ishtiaque Ahmed says all players are being paid. Mohammedan are currently second-last in the Indian Super League ( ISL) They face Chennaiyin FC in their next match on January 15.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117262167,imgsize-84278,width-400,resizemode-4/117262167.jpg"

KOLKATA: Describing them as a casualty of continuous poor refereeing calls and highlighting a “step-motherly treatment” in the Indian Super League , East Bengal club has decided to take their grievance to the doorstep of Union sports minister.The club is understood to have sent a missive to Mansukh L Mandaviya on Tuesday night, seeking intervention from him for Indian football ’s sorry state of affairs.East Bengal’s move came close on the heels of their latest loss to Mohun Bagan SG in the ISL during which the club claimed that referee Venkatest R ignored “a genuine” penalty call and gave an “unnecessary” booking to midfielder Souvik Chakrabarti, who had eventually received a marching order.“Throughout the last 10-12 years we had to bear the brunt of biased refereeing, be it in the ILeague or more so in the ISL,” club secretary Rupak Saha said in a statement.“The step-motherly treatment in ISL has made us wonder whether the ISL is still being run in the spirit of one-city-one-club with which it was envisaged originally,” he further noted.Meanwhile, the AIFF chief refereeing officer Trevor Kettle has backed Venkatesh’s decision, saying East Bengal were not denied a penalty in the derby in Guwahati, which Mohun Bagan SG won 1-0, their ninth win in 10 meetings against the city rivals in ISL.“These people (like Kettle) have made Indian football a laughing stock and forced us to reach the minister’s office for his intervention,” senior East Bengal official Debabrata Sarkar said.",East Bengal have taken their grievance to the doorstep of Union sports minister.

Liverpool 's charge towards the Premier League title was halted by stubborn Nottingham Forest in a 1-1 draw between the top two on Tuesday as Manchester City 's resurgence came undone in a 2-2 draw at Brentford.Chris Wood fired Forest in front early on at a raucous City Ground, but Liverpool dominated almost the entire 97 minutes and got back on level terms thanks to substitute Diogo Jota's goal with his first touch.Only a brilliant goalkeeping performance from Matz Sels denied the leaders victory, but the point maintained a six-point cushion over Forest for Arne Slot's men, who also have a game in hand.Forest had won their last seven games in all competitions to raise the possibility of matching Leicester's incredible title win of 2015/16.The in-form Wood had the home fans believing after just eight minutes when he slotted in Anthony Elanga's pass.Liverpool enjoyed over 70 percent possession and had 23 shots on goal but only posed a serious threat in front of goal after the break.Jota had only been on the field a matter of seconds when he nodded in Kostas Tsimikas' corner.Sels then made incredible saves to deny Jota, Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo a winner, while Salah also had a goalbound effort cleared off the line.""I could not have asked for more,"" said Slot. ""Second half was outstanding.""There are not many teams that can create so many chances against an opponent so defensively strong. Unfortunately we couldn't get a second.""Liverpool's second consecutive league draw opens the door for Arsenal to cut the gap at the top to four points when they host Tottenham in the north London derby on Wednesday.Any suggestion City could get themselves back in the title race was ended in a late collapse in west London as Brentford struck twice in the final 10 minutes for a deserved point.Phil Foden's double had City on course for a fourth consecutive win after a run of just one victory in 13 games.However, the English champions' defending was not convincing all night and they were punished as Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard netted for the Bees.Foden's return to the form that saw him crowned Premier League player of the year last season was the one positive for City.But Pep Guardiola will reflect on a missed opportunity to make up ground on the top four as City remain down in sixth, 12 points off the top.Foden produced a brilliant deft touch from Kevin De Bruyne's inviting delivery and then smashed in a rebound for his fourth goal in five league games.Brentford wasted a host of chances before conceding but finally got some reward for their attacking endeavour when Wissa slotted in from Mads Roerslev's cross to become the club's all-time leading goalscorer in the Premier League.They completed the comeback in stoppage time when Norgaard's header had too much power for Stefan Ortega.""We are not (at our best) and we didn't take the right decisions,"" said Guardiola. ""It's fine, it's not a good place to come. Unfortunately, we couldn't win.""Fourth-placed Chelsea's miserable run extended to five league games without a win but they were grateful for captain Reece James' stoppage-time equaliser salvaging a point in a 2-2 draw at home to Bournemouth.Cole Palmer's cool finish from Nicolas Jackson's through ball had given Chelsea the perfect start.But Bournemouth hit back through Justin Kluivert's penalty, before Antoine Semenyo's blistering near-post effort put the visitors in front.James has endured another injury-hit season but showed his quality by curling home a free-kick at the death.West Ham boss Graham Potter enjoyed a winning home debut as Fulham were beaten 3-2 at the London Stadium.Carlos Soler, Tomas Soucek and Lucas Paqueta were on target for the Hammers to take Potter's men above Manchester United and Tottenham into 12th.",Liverpool held to 1-1 draw by Nottingham Forest at the City Ground.

In a fortnight where new names and fresh faces have taken over the conversation -- Joao Fonseca, Jakub Mensik and Learner Tien -- to name a few, 21-year-old Carlos Alcaraz reminded the tennis world he was only a couple of years older than the ‘next generation’ of talents everyone is talking about.Alcaraz, the third-seeded Spaniard, playing on Rod Laver Arena for the first time in this edition of the tournament, flaunted staggering range as he moved past Nuno Borges 6-2, 6-4, 6-7 (3), 6-2 to claim a spot in the fourth-round of the Australian Open .Alcaraz -- bidding to become the youngest player to complete the career Grand Slam in men's singles history – said he had watched all of the games’ young talents, including 19-year-old left-hander Tien, who put out Daniil Medvedev late on Thursday.“I have seen those players, I have seen the level that they have. I didn't watch too much of Tien for example, but I watched a little bit last night and it was incredible. I don't know which ranking they are going to reach, but they have a lot of potential,” he said.“I'm talking like I'm 30 years old,” he said, smiling before adding, “I mean, I'm just two years older than them!”“They are getting experience in every tournament they play. On Thursday night we saw Tien beating Medvedev here and Fonseca playing his first five-set match as well,” Alcaraz said. “They're going to become even more dangerous.

Belinda Bencic scripts classic comeback tale at Melbourne Park,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/australian-open/belinda-bencic-scripts-classic-comeback-tale-at-melbourne-park/articleshow/117332782.cms,"Belinda Bencic. (Pic Credit - X)

If there’s a copybook style, a five-step rubric of how to return to the professional Tour after a maternity break, Belinda Bencic must have her name on it.The 27-year-old Swiss, an Olympic gold medallist in the singles, ranked in the game’s top-five some five years ago, gave birth to daughter Bella in April last year.On a windy Friday evening at Melbourne Park, when the air current played havoc with the ball toss, whipped up skirts and sent balls stray, Bencic, looking like she might’ve never really left the game, reached the Australian Open fourth-round in only her sixth tournament back after giving birth to daughter Bella eight months ago.Bencic, who climbed to No. 156 in the WTA Live rankings after starting at 1000-plus last November, did well to survive the Naomi Osaka onslaught until the Japanese retired from the contest with a strained abdominal muscle, after the opening set of their third-round clash, billed the meeting of 27-year-old moms.Osaka, whose daughter Shai will be two in July, hit through the court, and took a 5-3 lead, but threw in the towel at the end of the first set which she lost in the tie-break. The world No 51 picked up the abdominal injury during her run into the final in Auckland, ahead of the Australian Open.After the two women exchanged hugs, Bencic wrote on the camera, ‘get well soon moma’.Bencic, who led the head-to-head 3-2, coming into Friday’s third-round clash, was asked about the message in her post match press conference. Was she addressing her own mother or Osaka? Bencic pointed at the former No.1.Earlier, ahead of their clash, when Osaka was asked if she had been in touch with the Olympic gold medallist, she produced a classic verbal shrug. ‘I haven't caught up with her because I actually haven't seen her,’ she said.When Osaka had protested against the press conference format in the summer of 2021, refusing to go through the routine at the French Open, Bencic was sceptical.“I respect Naomi’s decision, but media is part of the job and it contributes to a worldwide publicity we have and we get paid very well,” she said. “Naomi does a lot of good things. On the other hand, I feel like sometimes it’s just about to remain in the talk.”Osaka hadn’t forgotten, but Bencic clearly had moved past it.Bencic and her 42-year-old boyfriend Martin Hromkovic , a Slovak footballer, who is now her strength and conditioning coach, have proven to be a team.The fourth-round of the Australian Open was not on Bencic’s mind when she arrived here, in fact she wondered if she should even be playing at this level so soon after the birth of her daughter.“Before I would always have more expectations, if I would have bigger results, but it's not the case now,” she said. “I don't even have to remind myself, I think like my body just tells me. If I see Bella, I just see her being only eight-and-a-half months now.”“Really happy with how the comeback is going. I'm just happy with every match I get to play,” she said. “It's not really about winning right now, it's about improving myself and getting back there to be able to play the biggest tournaments again and be up there ranking-wise.”Next up for Bencic is the Tour’s hottest player World no.3 Coco Gauff .“Coco obviously is one of the best players in the world right now,” she said. “I was able to watch her a little bit when I was just lying on the couch for the last nine months.”On Sunday, Bencic will stand across the court from the 20-year-old American, who is yet to drop a set this year.","Belinda Bencic reached the Australian Open fourth-round in only her sixth tournament back after giving birth to daughter Bella eight months ago.

NEW DELHI: A determined Novak Djokovic stormed into the last 16 of the Australian Open on Friday, delivering a commanding performance that underlined his status as a 10-time Melbourne champion. However, the 37-year-old required a medical timeout and used an inhaler during the match.After dropping a set in each of his first two matches, Djokovic came out with renewed purpose against the dangerous 26th-seeded Czech, Tomas Machac . The Serb dismantled his 24-year-old opponent in straight sets, winning 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 in 2 hours and 22 minutes.This victory marked Djokovic’s 66th appearance in the last 16 of a Grand Slam , putting him just three behind Roger Federer’s record of 69 and well ahead of Rafael Nadal’s 54.Next, Djokovic will face another Czech, Jiri Lehecka , who advanced after defeating France’s Benjamin Bonzi in straight sets. A potential blockbuster quarterfinal against Carlos Alcaraz looms if Djokovic progresses further.""I think I played really well, honestly. Very happy with my game,"" said the seventh seed. ""I was slightly surprised to beat him in straight sets. He was a break up in the second, and I struggled physically, but I managed to turn it around. In the third set, I felt fresh, moved well, and was very pleased with my performance. There's always room for improvement, but this was definitely my best match of the tournament.""With his new coach Andy Murray providing support from the stands, Djokovic began with a focused intensity. The match stayed on serve until the fourth game, where Djokovic broke Machac to move ahead 3-1. The veteran then went on a tear, winning three consecutive games to seal the first set.In the second set, Djokovic was broken early but responded immediately with a break of his own. Leading 2-1, he called for medical treatment and used an inhaler before resuming play. He broke Machac again for a 3-2 lead and maintained his composure to close out the set, celebrating with a fist pump and a roar to the crowd.""I was trying to catch my breath,"" he said afterward. ""I'm not 19 anymore — more like 19 times two, almost.""Djokovic left the court between sets, and upon his return, a Machac double fault gifted him an early advantage in the third. The Serb never looked back, cruising to victory with a commanding performance.Last year, Djokovic was stopped in the Melbourne semifinals by eventual champion Jannik Sinner, ending a streak of winning at least one major every year since 2017. His dominant display against Machac serves as a reminder that he remains a force to be reckoned with as he pursues a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title.","Novak Djokovic beats Tomas Machac 6-1, 6-4,6-4 to reach last 16 of Australian Open.

NEW DELHI: Carlos Alcaraz lost a set before muscling into the Australian Open round of 16 on Friday, bringing him one step closer to becoming the youngest person in history to win a career Grand Slam.The Portuguese world number 33 Nuno Borges was eliminated from the event 6-2, 6-4, 6-7 (3/7), 6-2 on Rod Laver Arena by the 21-year-old third seed, who was a class above.After spending his first two games of the season in the nearby Margaret Court Arena, it was Alcaraz's first time on center court.He dominated from the baseline, banging out 54 winners and nine aces while enjoying the atmosphere as the sun shone.""The last time I played here I lost, I really wanted to play here and get another win on Rod Laver,"" said the Spaniard, a four-time Grand Slam winner who is gunning for a first title in Australia.""It's a privilege to feel the love here in Australia. I'm trying to play different tennis, that's what makes me enjoy playing tennis, what makes me smile on court.""And to entertain the people as well, making them happy.""Alcaraz is attempting to become the youngest person in the Open Era to win all four majors and complete a career Grand Slam.

Borges lost the set after being broken again in game seven.When the Spanish player hit a forehand winner for the break and served out with his fifth ace of the day to secure a two-set lead, the 27-year-old gamely held on to a 4-4 lead in the second set.In the third set, Borges was on defense. In an exciting 16-point seventh game, he fought off two break points from Alcaraz to keep the set on serve.However, he wouldn't back down, and after a tie break, he shocked the world number three by decisively winning.Set four began with Alcaraz holding serve to love, but he was so fired up that he unleashed a stunning forehand winner for a break and ran to the end.",Carlos Alcaraz beats Nuno Borges in straight sets to reach Australian Open quarterfinals.

He gained the break after an eight-stroke rally after a Fearnley double fault gave him a chance. This was sufficient to take the set.In the second set, they traded early breaks before Zverev was allowed in again by a double fault by the Briton, and a badly played backhand at the net gave the German an insurmountable 5-4 advantage.In the third set, Zverev once again lost up an early break, but he immediately recovered to put pressure on Fearnley's service, move 4-2 clear, and then cruise to the finish line.Although Zverev had one of his best seasons in 2020, his best Grand Slams to date are still his runner-up results at the 2020 US Open and French Open","Second seed Alexander Zverev defeated Briton Jacob Fearnley in straight sets.

Poll Do you believe Yuzvendra Chahal's dismissal of dating rumors with RJ Mahvash? Yes, I believe him No, I think there's something going on I’m not sure I don’t follow their personal lives

Indian cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal has addressed the swirling rumours about his personal life, particularly those linking him to RJ Mahvash following his divorce from Dhanashree Verma.In a candid chat on Raj Shamani’s podcast, the cricketer spoke about heartbreak, healing, and how public speculation made things worse for everyone involved.Chahal firmly dismissed the dating buzz. “No, there’s nothing. People can think whatever they want to think,” he said, clarifying that he isn’t seeing anyone.On whether he’s open to love again, he admitted, “It will take time to process. I need to gather myself. I’m not afraid to fall in love again, but I’m scared of losing the person because I get attached with all my heart.”Rumours linking him to Mahvash intensified after they were spotted together during a Champions Trophy game, but Chahal said things were taken out of context.“We had a Christmas dinner with five people, but the photo was cropped to make it look like just the two of us were on a dinner date,” added Chahal.He also recalled a video recorded while she dropped him to the airport: “I was just fixing my hair, and people started saying all sorts of cheap things...That really hurt me.”Mahvash, he said, stood by him during a dark period, but the trolling got intense. “Even she clarified it, but it was very hard for her. She was called a homewrecker… people said really nasty things.”He even joked about online speculation: ""I saw on Twitter (now 'X') that Yuzi Chahal is getting married on 31st June. And people actually believed it in the comments; I was just watching it all unfold.""Chahal also spoke about wearing the viral “Be Your Own Sugar Daddy” tee.“I didn’t abuse anyone, didn’t say anything; I just wanted to give that message,” he said.","Indian cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal has addressed the swirling rumours about his personal life, particularly those linking him to RJ Mahvash.

TimesofIndia.com in London: Gus Atkinson made an immediate impact on his return to the England XI but admitted the team was concerned about Chris Woakes ’ injury after a stop-start first day at The Oval.“I don’t know too much, but it doesn’t look too great,” Atkinson said at the press conference. “It’s the last game of the series, so it’s a big shame.”Woakes left the field late in the day with a shoulder injury sustained while fielding. England were already a bowler short after a wayward performance from Jamie Overton and Josh Tongue.Atkinson, though, had a good outing with two wickets and a direct-hit run-out of Shubman Gill . “If we can keep them to 230-240, we’re still in a good position,” he said.India ended the day on 204 for 6, with Karun Nair producing a gutsy unbeaten 52 in testing conditions. It was Nair’s first Test fifty in 3,148 days, the last being his triple century in 2016. He walked in with India wobbling and put together a crucial 51-run stand with Washington Sundar (19*).Nair’s knock, which included seven boundaries, was a rare moment of calm on a day when the ball constantly beat the bat. He brought up his half-century with a couple off Jacob Bethell.With just 64 overs possible due to rain, India will be the happier side after fighting back from 153 for 6. England, meanwhile, will hope Woakes can recover in time to bowl again.","Gus Atkinson made an immediate impact on his return to the England XI.

Poll Do you think Shubman Gill will break more records as captain of the Indian Test team? Yes, definitely No, this is his peak He'll break records in other formats

In what has been a stunning series for Shubman Gill as India’s Test captain, the batter has etched his name into the record books by breaking a 47-year-old milestone.Heading into the fifth and final Test against England at The Oval, India trailed the series 2-1 and needed a win to draw level. But while the team’s position remains challenging, Gill’s individual form has stood out throughout. Leading from the front, he has now scored 737* runs in the series — the most ever by an Indian captain in a single Test series.The previous record was held by the legendary Sunil Gavaskar, who had amassed 732 runs against the West Indies in the 1978/79 series. Gill’s record-breaking moment came during his ongoing knock in the first innings of the final Test, continuing a consistent run of performances that includes four centuries with the highest being a stunning 269.His dominance with the bat has been a central highlight for India in a hard-fought series, as the young skipper continues to grow into the leadership role. While his efforts may not be enough to seal the series unless India win at The Oval, they have certainly marked a new chapter in Indian cricket.Interestingly, while Gill now tops the chart for most Test runs in a series by an Indian captain, Virat Kohli still holds the record in both white-ball formats — 558 runs in an ODI series against South Africa in 2018, and 231 in a T20I series against England in 2021.As captaincy transitions continue across formats, Gill’s red-ball credentials are now firmly established.With Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul gone, the captain will once again need to take matters into his own hands to help India to a formidable first innings total.","Shubman Gill has now scored 737* runs in the series.

Poll How impressed are you with Karun Nair's performance in the fifth Test at The Oval? Very Impressed Somewhat Impressed It's too late

Karun Nair made the most of his opportunity in the fifth and final Test at The Oval, scoring a vital half-century under pressure to keep India afloat after a shaky start. Returning to the playing XI after being dropped for the fourth Test in Manchester, Nair showed grit and calm in challenging conditions.India were in trouble at 83/3 when Nair walked in, and the team needed someone to steady the innings. The 33-year-old did just that, reaching his fifty in 89 balls with a clip off the pads for two runs off Jacob Bethell. It was a quiet celebration, with a raise of the bat towards the dressing room, acknowledging an important knock not just for the match, but for his own career.This was Nair’s second-highest Test score, only behind his iconic unbeaten 303 against England in Chennai back in 2016. That triple century had set high expectations, but this latest knock was his first Test fifty in nearly nine years. To be exact, it was his first fifty in 3,148 days to put things into context. This in itself is a milestone that may revive his red-ball journey.At stumps on Day 1, Nair stood at 52 unbeaten and was part of a 51-run partnership with Washington Sundar, taking India to 204/6. With the series on the line and India trailing 2-1, Nair’s effort was a timely reminder of his potential and perseverance.In a heartwarming moment, England's Joe Root was seen patting the India batter on his back, appreciating his efforts.With the painful wicket of captain Shubman Gill from a run out to both Sai Sudharsan and Raivndra Jadeja dismissed by two unplayable Josh Tongue balls, India were in trouble. The visitors have Karun Nair and Washington Sundar to thank for crossing the 200-run mark at the end of day's play.",Karun Nair scored a vital half-century for India against England at The Oval.

Bombay Sport Exchange: FanCode's Yannick Colaco on toxic fan wars, India's sports ecosystem

NEW DELHI: India leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal has opened up about his divorce from influencer and choreographer Dhanashree Verma, revealing the emotional turmoil and mental health struggles he endured during the difficult phase of his life.In a deeply personal conversation on Raj Shamani’s podcast, Chahal admitted that the separation was not sudden but had been a long, private process. The couple kept their struggles off social media, projecting normalcy until they were certain about ending their marriage.“It was going on for a long while,” Chahal said. “We decided we do not want to show the people... We were like, until we reach the point of the end, we are not going to say anything. We will be like a normal couple on social media. Yes, I was faking it.”Reflecting on their incompatibility, Chahal spoke about how both he and Dhanashree were deeply invested in their careers and struggled to find common ground. “A relationship is like a compromise. If one gets angry, the other has to listen… Two ambitious people can stay together, but everyone has their own lives, their own goals.”The most disturbing aspect, he shared, was the vicious rumours surrounding the breakup.“When I was going through the divorce thing, people labeled me as a cheater. I have never cheated. You won’t get a more loyal person than me,” he said. “Just because you're seen with someone, people link you up and write for views. I have two sisters, I know how to respect women.”Chahal also admitted that the mental strain pushed him to the edge. “For one month, I used to sleep for only two hours. I had suicidal thoughts, I shared them with my friends,” he revealed. “I needed a break from cricket. Even on the field, my mind wasn’t there.”On his viral T-shirt that read ""Be your own sugar daddy"", which he wore to court, Chahal cryptically added, “Something happened from the other side, so I wanted to give this message.”Despite the turmoil, Chahal says the separation was peaceful and mutual. “If things are happening between two people, they can still happen with peace,” he said.",India leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal has opened up about his divorce from influencer and choreographer Dhanashree Verma.

Anshul Kamboj Joins India Nets After Nitish’s Injury | Debut Incoming at Manchester?

Poll How many Tests should be fair to judge a young pacer like Anshul Kamboj? 5 Tests 10 Tests 1 Test is enough

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has thrown his weight behind young pacer Anshul Kamboj, urging critics not to judge him based on a single performance. Kamboj had a forgettable debut in the fourth Test against England in Manchester, but Ganguly believes the 24-year-old deserves a longer rope.""Don't judge Anshul on one Test. He is a young kid, and he has picked wickets in domestic cricket. Give him five to eight Tests before passing a judgment on him on how good he is,"" Ganguly said during a press conference on Thursday, as quoted by ANI.Kamboj was drafted into the squad midway through the series after India’s injury crisis deepened. Akash Deep was dealing with a groin niggle, Arshdeep Singh took a hit on his hand, and Nitish Kumar Reddy had already been ruled out. Just days after flying in, Kamboj was thrown into the playing XI and handed the new ball ahead of Mohammed Siraj.However, the Haryana pacer struggled to find rhythm. He frequently missed his lines and lengths, allowing England openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett to dominate. He eventually picked up his maiden Test wicket by dismissing Duckett for 94, finishing with figures of 1/89.Providing further context, Ganguly expressed surprise at the exclusion of Mukesh Kumar from the England tour, especially given his impressive red-ball record.""I was surprised not to see Mukesh Kumar in the squad. His red-ball numbers in domestic cricket are phenomenal. These conditions would have been suitable for him. Hopefully, in future, he will get his chance,"" he said.Mukesh was part of the India A side that played the England Lions before the series, taking three wickets in his only outing.

At first glance, 22-year-old Harshika Jain’s football ing roots don’t scream ‘history maker’. A girl from a business family in Mumbai’s plush Altamount Road, she was just another sports-loving kid who dabbled in everything from basketball to handball to hockey. But by the time she turned 11, football had kicked everything else aside.Two days ago, Harshika became the first Indian footballer to sign with a Romanian firstdivision club, joining Atletic Olimpia Gherla. No Indian has ever featured in Romania’s top two leagues before.Moving from India to play professional football at the European stage, Harshika is following in the footsteps of Bala Devi, Manisha Kalyan and Aditi Chauhan. Her signing isn’t just about international firsts; it’s also one of persistence, late-night training sessions, lockdown drills, and a young girl breaking into all-boys’ teams.Harshika’s football journey began at school, where she could always be found on the football ground. And she could be spotted quite easily, too, as she would be the only girl training with boys. It was the same in her locality, where she would always have to play with the other boys as no girls joined it.The move to Romania came through trial at Olimpia Gherla, where she impressed legendary coach Mirel Albon, the man behind Romania’s rise in women’s football.After 20 days of trial, the club offered her a contract.“It feels like family here,” Harshika told TOI. “And that’s important to me. I’m close to my family, and the club environment reflects that. They’ve welcomed me with open arms.” Despite going global, her dream remains rooted in national colours. “Wearing India’s jersey, that’s the dream. Always has been.”","Harshika Jain became the first Indian footballer to sign with a Romanian firstdivision club, joining Atletic Olimpia Gherla.

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has confirmed that the much-hyped coaching application from Spanish legend Xavi Hernandez was fake. The AIFF also revealed that it had received a similar application from someone pretending to be Pep Guardiola.In an official statement released after a key technical committee meeting, the federation said it could not verify the authenticity of emails that claimed to include applications from both Xavi and Guardiola. It later turned out they were not genuine.""Additionally, the AIFF received an email furnishing the applications from Spanish coaches Pep Guardiola and Xavi Hernandez. The authenticity of their applications could not be confirmed, and it has since emerged that the email applications were not genuine,"" the statement read.There had been a buzz in Indian football circles when reports suggested that Xavi, the former Barcelona captain and recent manager, was interested in the India job. That buzz has now been put to rest, with the federation focused on practical choices moving forward.After going through 170 coaching applications, the AIFF’s technical committee has shortlisted three names for the head coach role: Stephen Constantine, Stefan Tarkovic, and Khalid Jamil.Constantine is well known in Indian football, Tarkovic brings experience from Europe, while Jamil has a strong connection with the domestic scene.Subrata Paul, Director of National Teams, said the AIFF wants someone who understands Indian and Asian football deeply. “It is a very important moment for Indian football. We want a coach who brings technical expertise but also understands our unique culture, style, and players,” he said.India’s recent drop in performance and a current FIFA ranking of 133 has added pressure on the federation.

Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba of Inter Miami have been suspended by Major League Soccer for missing Wednesday's All-Star game, making them ineligible for Saturday's match against FC Cincinnati. The league announced the suspension on Friday, enforcing its policy that requires selected players to participate in the All-Star game unless they have valid reasons for absence.The duo withdrew from the showcase event early Wednesday without revealing their reasons.

I don't think there's a player -- or anyone -- who has done more for Major League Soccer than Messi.I fully understand, respect, and admire his commitment to Inter Miami, and I respect his decision.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

His strong performance at the ExCeL Arena helped Mahindra finish fourth in the Formula E Teams’ Championship and fifth in the Manufacturers’ Championship. He was joined on the podium on Sunday by Envision Racing’s Sébastien Buemi.Nyck de Vries’ double podium in London brought his season tally to three, having also finished second in Monaco. Reflecting on his second consecutive podium, de Vries said, “It was certainly a very challenging race. Obviously, Nick [Cassidy] didn’t want to get too low on energy compared to everyone behind, so he was making sure he stayed on the same energy level as us. That resulted in a bit of a concertina effect behind us. ”He added, “I’m very pleased to bring home another podium and secure P4 for our team, because they’ve done an incredible job. To think that last year we qualified last on merit, and now we’ve come such a long way to finish fourth in the championship — this is a great effort.I’m very proud of everyone at Mahindra.”Envision Racing’s Sebastien Buemi also earned his third podium of the season in London, finishing third behind Nick Cassidy and Nyck de Vries in Sunday’s Round 16.

I think I was lucky enough to avoid them well. I saved quite a bit of energy at the beginning, and that basically allowed me to take Attack Mode properly. So, in the end, I’m very happy with that.

N ick Cassidy seems to have all the luck on his side as he went on to win his third race of the season, just days after announcing his exit from Jaguar TCS Racing at the end of this season. The New Zealander won the London E-Prix Round 15 race at the ExCeL Arena on Saturday. He himself called the win “unbelievable,” which was also witnessed by his grandmother at the circuit. Not only that, he also secured a front-row start for the Round 16 race on Sunday.Nick Cassidy himself was in disbelief over his third win and said, “It’s unbelievable! To win here at home for Jaguar and our team, in front of a lot of our friends, family, and partners who are here today, is incredible.”Talking about their strategy and the car, he said, “I wasn’t the happiest guy this morning, but that was for a reason, and I knew we had good potential in the car. In that race, I was able to show that, which is pretty cool.To be honest, it was a little bit fluid — a huge shoutout to my strategy team. I was really scared about not coming out of the pits after Pit Boost in the lead of that second group, and it was tight, but I was able to hang on there, and that’s what made the race.It meant that we could do the Attack Modes later, which was really powerful.”Nick Cassidy also shared a video montage of his podium celebration, where he sprayed champagne and celebrated with his team and family. He wrote, “Parked it in Victory Lane in London! That was incredibly special and will take a while to sink in. One more race today to finish off the season @jaguarracing.”The official social media pages of Formula E also shared a video featuring Cassidy’s grandmother, who witnessed his victory at the London E-Prix.

Kush Maini is a pro when it comes to cricket knowledge

Who is Kush Maini?

Mahindra Racing’s Indian Formula 2 champion Kush Maini is not just an impressive presence on the track but also well-versed in his country’s favourite sport — cricket. The racer from Bengaluru recently took a cricket quiz and nearly scored a perfect 10/10, answering almost every question with precision. He is the only Indian to have won a Formula 2 race in Monaco and recently delivered an impressive performance at the Berlin Rookie Test, finishing among the top three in both sessions.A video of Kush Maini’s cricket quiz shows him getting momentarily confused with the first question, though he gave the correct answer initially. When asked about the number of players in a cricket team, he initially said “eleven” but changed it to “twelve” after counting the number of openers and following players.After that brief hiccup, Maini breezed through the quiz like a pro. He correctly answered questions about the criteria for a four and a six, and explained terms like LBW, duck, and clean bowled. He also knew the number of overs bowled in T20, One-Day, and Test matches.When asked which team Virat Kohli represents in the IPL, Maini confidently replied, “RCB… that’s me, can’t get that wrong.” He also tackled a question about the British singer who joked about not understanding cricket despite coming from the country that invented it.Maini answered “Ed Sheeran” — and was pleasantly surprised to learn he was right. He also knew that David Beckham was the English footballer who once played a friendly match with Sachin Tendulkar.Watch Kush Maini’s candid video here Kush Maini moved to England at the age of 13–14 to pursue racing. Originally from Bengaluru, he now spends more time abroad than in India. He became the first Indian to win the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix in Formula 2 earlier this year.He recently showcased his racing talent during the Berlin Rookie Test, representing Mahindra Racing. He finished second in the morning session and third in the afternoon. Speaking after the test, he said, “In the morning, we focused on 350kW runs, and in the afternoon, more on race runs. Whatever the run, we were always in the top three and really fast, so a good step was made. Whenever I get into this car, I leave with a smile on my face. ”Also Read: Berlin Rookie Test standouts Gabriele Minì and Kush Maini share insights after impressive runs Maini continues to shine on the track and, following his impressive performance in Berlin, may even join Formula E one day.","Kush Maini is the only Indian to have won a Formula 2 race in Monaco.

FIA and Formula E comment on agreement extension



In good news for Formula E, a multi-year agreement extension has secured the rights to the FIA Formula E World Championship for an additional 10 years from 2038, when the current agreement ends. This ensures a long and thrilling future for the FIA Formula E World Championship. The long-term extension will enable Formula E to grow further, build strategic long-range partnerships, and drive greater fan engagement.At present, Formula E continues to focus on its phased development strategy for its racing cars — delivering faster top speeds, greater acceleration, enhanced aerodynamics, and improved tyre performance. These developments highlight the series' increased relevance to consumers and the wider EV market, with greater “race to road” technology transfer.With electric vehicle sales projected to rise to over 40% of global vehicle sales by 2030, and global lithium-ion battery production expected to triple by 2030, the relevance of Formula E and its technological advancements is more critical than ever. The Formula E GEN3 Evo already represents a step-change in performance: 0–60 mph in just 1.82 seconds (30% faster than a current Formula 1 car), a 200 mph top speed, and nearly 50% of the energy needed to complete a race regenerated during the event.It is designed with sustainability at its core and includes tyres made with 35% recycled materials and bodywork incorporating recycled carbon fibre and natural fibres.Formula E sees the participation of major automotive manufacturers including Porsche, Jaguar, Nissan, Maserati, Stellantis, Mahindra, and Lola-Yamaha. Since its first race in Beijing in 2014, Formula E has grown by 20% year-on-year, reaching around 400 million fans globally and attracting a television audience of approximately half a billion.The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the global governing body for motorsport and mobility organisations, has announced a multi-year extension to its agreement with Formula E Holdings Limited (majority-owned by Liberty Global).Mohammed Ben Sulayem, President at the FIA, said, “The extension of the agreement governing the FIA Formula E World Championship is a fantastic outcome for the sport and a clear reflection of our ongoing strategy at the FIA to foster long-term stability, innovation, and growth across all areas of motorsport.”He further said, “This milestone reaffirms our commitment to innovation, sustainability, and technological progress, which are all central to the Championship’s unique identity and purpose. It also aligns with our broader goal of increasing global participation and driving more accessible motorsport for all. We are delighted to be continuing this journey with Formula E, and I look forward to seeing it grow even further, both on and off the track, in the years to come. ”FIA Chief Commercial Officer Craig Edmondson, said, “Formula E has not only demonstrated impressive growth since its inception, but has also led the way on sustainable innovation in our industry. This is a landmark agreement for the FIA and Formula E, and we are excited to be working with the Championship in the years to come.”Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries said, “We’ve believed in Formula E since day one, and this extension reaffirms our confidence in where it’s headed. This is the motorsport of the future - a championship that combines the very latest technology, close-combat racing, and a mission that really matters.“With the FIA’s continued backing, we can now take the next big steps - scaling the sport, growing its global fanbase, and continuing to push the boundaries of what electric racing can achieve. With this new agreement in place, Formula E is now positioned better than ever to define the future of motorsport - more innovative, more inclusive, more sustainable - and to inspire the next generation of fans, drivers, and partners around the world. ""Also Read: Formula E London E-Prix 2025: Pascal Wehrlein tops FP1, Jake Dennis finishes second Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds also added, “Formula E’s growth since its inception has been nothing short of extraordinary, with hundreds of millions of fans and world-class teams and drivers deciding to choose highly competitive electric racing. This long-term extension of the partnership enables us to continue building the brand, investing in the product and delivering some of the most captivating racing that has made us famous.

Toronto:

Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek cruised, Naomi Osaka battled through and Canadian Eugenie Bouchard called time on her WTA career with a gutsy second-round loss in Montreal on Wednesday.Switzerland's Belinda Bencic sent Bouchard into retirement with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 victory -- but not before the Canadian thrilled her hometown fans by seizing an early break in the third set.Spectators were on their feet, trying to will Bouchard to another victory on the heels of her first-round triumph on Monday -- her first WTA win since 2023.But Bencic won five of the last six games to vanquish Bouchard, who had announced earlier in July she would retire after a final appearance in her home tournament.""I think it's so special to play my last match here in Montreal on this court in front of you guys,"" a teary Bouchard said as she was honoured on court after the match.""I remember being a little kid sitting in these stands, hoping and dreaming that I would play on this court one day.""I grew up playing on these courts, and courts all around Montreal and near here, so it feels like such a full circle moment to finish my career here.""Bouchard, who rose as high as fifth in the world rankings, shot to prominence in 2014 when she reached the Wimbledon final and made semi-final runs at the Australian and French Opens.But her career was hindered by injuries, including a concussion suffered in a locker room slip at the 2015 US Open and a shoulder injury that required surgery in 2021.There was no drama for Poland's Swiatek, who breezed past Chinese qualifier Guo Hanyu 6-3, 6-1 in her first match since her crushing victory over Amanda Anisimova in the Wimbledon final.Swiatek, seeded second, broke Guo's serve six times to book her spot in the third round.It was much harder going for Japan's four-time Grand Slam champion Osaka, who saved two match points in a 4-6, 7-6 (8/6) 6-3 triumph over Liudmila Samsonova.Osaka, now working with Tomasz Wiktorowski after announcing on Monday she had split with coach Patrick Mouratoglou, surrendered early breaks in each of the first two sets.Wimbledon quarter-finalist Samsonova served for the match at 5-4 in the second and led 40-15. The Russian fired a forehand long on her first match point and on her second a lackluster drop shot effort gave Osaka an opening and the Japanese star pounced.Samsonova's double fault on break point allowed Osaka to level the set, and after storming back from 5-2 down in the tiebreaker to force a third set Osaka took control early, breaking Samsonova twice on the way to a 4-1 lead.""She definitely came out really hard and, for me, I was definitely overwhelmed and I didn't know if I should also be hitting winners,"" Osaka said. ""After a while I just tried to keep the ball in court.""Jessica Pegula, the two-time defending champion and third seed, saved five set points in the opening set on the way to a 7-5, 6-4 victory over Maria Sakkari of Greece.Australian Open champion Madison Keys, the sixth seed, opened her campaign with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Laura Siegemund, avenging a third-round loss to the German at Wimbledon.Second-seeded Taylor Fritz struggled with three rain delays and a stubborn Spanish opponent on Wednesday, pulling out a tight 7-5, 7-6 (7/1) win over Roberto Carballes Baena at the ATP Toronto Masters.The second-round match was halted repeatedly by light rain, with the final 18-minute pause coming just as the second-set tiebreaker was about to start.But Fritz, winner of Stuttgart and Eastbourne titles this season, quickly sprinted to victory before heavier rains were expected to set in.The American was far from pleased with a win which was marred by 45 unforced errors and confessed that he has not yet felt on his game in Canada.""Even in practice I'm having a hard time putting the ball into the court,"" he said. ""But I'm happy to get through this one.""Everything is not feeling great, it's tough to control the ball.""Since I've been here it's been absolutely brutal. But I have another match to figure it out and hopefully I can play myself into the tournament.""Fritz's fourth-seeded compatriot Ben Shelton had no complaints after earning his first career win over gritty Frenchman Adrian Mannarino 6-2, 6-3.Shelton had dropped two prior meetings with 37-year-old qualifier Mannarino but said he was able to vary his serve to get over the line this time.""This win was huge for me. He's a shotmaker, he can take the racquet out of your hands,"" Shelton said. ""I've played well against him in the past and come up short, he can make things really difficult.""- Tiafoe hangs on -American Frances Tiafoe squeezed out a win after more than two and a quarter hours against Japan's Yosuke Watanuki, hailing his opponent's fighting spirit after a 1-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7/5) triumph.""He can hit a winner on any shot,"" Tiafoe said. ""I needed some luck in those last two sets to win.""Tiafoe managed just 19 winners to the 45 of his 158th-ranked foe, but now lines up against Australian Alexsandar Vukic, who defeated Briton Cam Norrie 6-3, 6-7 (2/7), 6-3.Andrey Rublev, runner-up in Canada a year ago to Alexei Popyrin, won his 250th career match on hardcourt as he beat France's Hugo Gaston 6-2, 6-3.The sixth seed needed four match points to advance after 86 minutes and now plays Italian Lorenzo Sonego, a 6-1, 6-4 winner over China's Bu Yunchaokete.Wimbledon quarter-finalist Flavio Cobolli of Italy delivered four aces in the final game of a rain-interrupted match to clinch a 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 victory over Canadian Alexis Galarneau.But Canadian Gabriel Diallo came out on top against his Italian opponent, beating Matteo Gigante 6-3, 7-6 (7/5) to next face Fritz.Montreal's Felix Auger-Aliassime suffered another early disappointment, losing his opening match in his home Masters for a third straight year as he fell to Fabian Marozsan 6-4, 6-4.Former top 10 ranking regular Stefanos Tsitsipas, now 30th in the world, continued a downward slide with a 6-4. 4-6, 6-2 loss to Australian Christopher O'Connell.Alex de Minaur, winner in Washington on Sunday, defeated Francisco Comesana 6-4, 6-2.""It was not pretty by any means,"" Australia's de Minaur said. ""The wind and rain made it quite tough. I'm happy I was engaged and focused from the first point to the last.""Backing up a good week is the toughest ask in tennis. You don't have a lot of time to enjoy the moment after a week of emotional highs.""You have to find a way to re-set and do it all over again.""","Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek cruised, Naomi Osaka battled through.

Former World No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas has ended his brief coaching partnership with Goran Ivanisevic after just two tournaments. The Greek tennis star, now ranked 29th globally, is returning to work with his father Apostolos following poor results and public criticism from the Croatian about his fitness levels.Tsitsipas confirmed the split through a statement, saying, ""Working with Goran Ivanišević was a brief but intense experience and a truly valuable chapter in my journey.""Ivanišević, who previously coached Novak Djokovic, toldthat the split was amicable. He supported Tsitsipas's decision to return to his father, noting, ""He had his best results with his father, his father knows him the best so I agree that is the right decision.""Their partnership started during the French Open but quickly soured. Under Ivanišević, Tsitsipas won only one match at the Halle Open before losing to Luciano Darderi. He then retired with a back injury in the first round of Wimbledon against Valentin Royer.The relationship became strained when Ivanišević publicly criticised Tsitsipas's fitness. ""I was shocked. I have never seen a more unprepared player in my life. With this knee, I am three times more fit than him. This is really bad,"" the Croatian coach toldTsitsipas later hinted at his dissatisfaction, telling, ""It is very difficult to have dictators and people who speak negatively and you don't feel like they are close to you like family.""The 26-year-old has struggled to maintain his form over the past year. He removed his father from his coaching team last August after losing to Kei Nishikori, then ranked 576th. He's also made equipment changes and tried new tactics but continues to struggle against the evolving playing styles of younger stars like Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz.Tsitsipas's ranking has dropped out of the top 20 for the first time since 2018.","Stefanos Tsitsipas has ended his brief coaching partnership with Goran Ivanisevic.

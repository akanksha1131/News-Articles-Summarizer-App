Rishabh Pant-led Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) will lock horns against Axar Patel 's Delhi Capitals (DC) in match No 40 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow.With five wins in seven games, DC are placed at the second place on the points table, whereas LSG are at fifth position with 10 points in eight games.For Lucknow the poor form of their captain Rishabh Pant is a big worry. He has merely 106 runs from eight games and 63 of those came in a single match. His strike-rate of 98 is also a tad worrisome.On the other hand, Axar too will have some concerns about their skipper -- Axar Patel. Axar has led well and made 140 runs at a strike-rate of 159, but those improvements have masked his diminishing returns as a bowler -- just a solitary wicket from seven matches at an economy of 9.36.This season, LSG have played four matches at home, two each on black and red soil surfaces, respectively. The black soil pitches have favoured the team’s strengths and brought two victories, while the team has lost both matches played on the red soil pitch, which will be used for Tuesday’s game. Rishabh Pant and Co. will be keeping their fingers crossed heading into this one.LSG predicted XI: Aiden Markram, Mitchell Marsh, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh Pant (c & wk), Ayush Badoni, David Miller, Abdul Samad, Shardul Thakur, Avesh Khan, Ravi Bishnoi, Prince YadavDigvesh RathiAbhishek Porel, KL Rahul (wk), Karun Nair, Axar Patel (c), Tristan Stubbs, Ashutosh Sharma, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Mukesh KumarDonovan FerreiraAccuWeather forecasts a temperature drop from 36°C at the start of the match to 29°C by the end, with no rain expected.Catch the match between LSG vs DC on the Star Sports Network on TV, with livestreaming available on JioHotstar from 7:30 PM IST onwards.Rishabh Pant (wk/captain), Aiden Markram, Mitchell Marsh, Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, Abdul Samad, David Miller, Shardul Thakur, Avesh Khan, Akash Deep, Digvesh Singh Rathi, Ravi Bishnoi, Prince Yadav, Shahbaz Ahmed, Matthew Breetzke, Himmat Singh, Shamar Joseph, Manimaran Siddharth, Aryan Juyal, RS Hangargekar, Yuvraj Chaudhary, Akash Maharaj Singh, Mayank Yadav, Arshin Kulkarni.Axar Patel (c), Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, Karun Nair, KL Rahul(w), Tristan Stubbs, Ashutosh Sharma, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Mukesh Kumar, Sameer Rizvi, Darshan Nalkande, Donovan Ferreira, Tripurana Vijay, Dushmantha Chameera, Faf du Plessis, T Natarajan, Ajay Jadav Mandal, Manvanth Kumar L, Madhav Tiwari.","Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) take on Delhi Capitals (DC) in match No 40 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

NEW DELHI: A commanding 114-run opening stand between skipper Shubman Gill and Sai Sudharsan on a sluggish Eden Gardens surface proved decisive as Gujarat Titans outclassed Kolkata Knight Riders by 39 runs in their IPL clash on Monday.Sent in to bat on a pitch described as “really slow” by both captains, Gill and Sudharsan played with patience and precision, blunting any early advantage KKR hoped to gain after opting to bowl. The Titans posted a competitive 198/3, hitting just five sixes in their innings but making smart use of gaps and strike rotation.Gill, who looked set for his first hundred of the season, fell for a sublime 90 off 55 balls (10 fours, 3 sixes), while Sudharsan continued his consistent form with 52 off 36. Jos Buttler, fresh from his last match heroics, remained unbeaten on 41 from 23 balls, surprisingly not hitting a single six but crunching eight boundaries.The target of 199 proved well beyond KKR’s reach as they were restricted to 159/8. The loss was their fifth in eight matches, leaving them languishing in seventh place. Titans, meanwhile, stayed at the top with 12 points from eight games. Ajinkya Rahane , leading KKR, top-scored with 50 off 36 but lacked support. Rahmanullah Gurbaz fell in the opening over to Mohammed Siraj, and the hosts never recovered. GT’s spinners then tightened the screws — Rashid Khan (2/25), Sai Kishore (1/19), and Washington Sundar (1/36) all struck at key intervals.Post-match, Rahane acknowledged the Titans’ strong start. “I thought 199 was chaseable. We came back into the game well with the ball, but our batting let us down again. We’ve struggled to get solid starts, and that’s something we need to improve quickly,” he said.He added, “The pitch was slow, but 200 was still gettable. It’s about being brave with the bat — you can’t think about getting out. We need to back ourselves, especially in the middle overs.”Purple Cap holder Prasidh Krishna (2/25) and veteran Ishant Sharma (1/18) ensured KKR had no late surge, sealing another clinical win for the Titans.","Gujarat Titans beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 39 runs in IPL clash.

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

Poll Should Rohit Sharma continue as captain of the Indian cricket team? No, it's time for a change. Yes, he should continue.

IND vs AUS: Rohit Sharma has had a terrible time with the bat in whites

Australian cricket legend Steve Waugh has advised Indian captain Rohit Sharma to reflect on his future in cricket, particularly regarding his leadership role ahead of India's upcoming Test series against England in June. Waugh emphasised that Rohit, who turns 38 this month, must make his own decision about continuing as captain while also expressing concerns about protecting Test cricket amid the growing popularity of T20 leagues .Waugh believes the decision about leading India must come from Rohit himself, especially considering his recent performance struggles.""It is totally up to him. He is the only one who can solve that problem. He has got to look himself in the mirror and say, do I still want to be captain or play for India? Am I committed?"" Waugh, a member of the Laureus World Sports Academy , said.""Am I putting enough time and effort into it? It is a privilege and an honour to play for your country. You can't be complacent or relax,"" he added.Rohit's recent form has been concerning, with poor performances in Test series against Bangladesh, New Zealand, and Australia. He notably opted out of the Sydney Test due to poor form during India's 1-3 series loss earlier this year in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Waugh also addressed the future of Test cricket, stressing on its importance despite T20's rising popularity.""There is stress on Test cricket, whether it will survive because we need it as a sport. T20 cricket is amazing, great for players and spectators and great for sponsors but I still think Test cricket is the very essence of cricket. The players I believe still want to play Tests to see how good they can actually be. It's the ultimate contest. Making sure that it survives and thrives and is healthy is really important,"" Waugh explained.Regarding criticism about South Africa's World Test Championship qualification despite playing fewer matches, Waugh defended the current system.""There's always complaints. In Champions Trophy, India played a neutral ground in Dubai and people complained about that. You have to do what you can to make things happen. It's not a perfect situation. Some countries play a lot of Test matches, some don't play many. South Africa probably didn't play as many as other countries. They were pretty successful in what they did. I believe the two best Test playing countries are lining up in the final,"" he stated.Waugh opposed the proposed two-tier system for Test cricket.""I don't like two tier, It weakens whoever's in the second tier not playing vs strong sides, they're not going to be able to improve and get better. The top sides will keep getting better and stronger and it'll just separate world cricket into teams that are top level and other teams that are okay and we want to develop the other teams right now,"" he remarked.""Test cricket is pretty strong actually, it's probably seven or eight sides capable of beating each other and that hasn't been the case for few years so I actually think Test cricket is going okay right now,"" Waugh said.On the suggestion of bonus points for away wins in the 2025-27 WTC cycle, Waugh disagreed.""That's all subjective. How do you say who's a stronger team? I think the current system is pretty good. At end of the day, you've got to be consistent, you've got to win both away and at home,"" he commented.","Australian cricket legend Steve Waugh has advised Indian captain Rohit Sharma to reflect on his future in cricket.

IPL Points Table after KKR vs GT at Eden Gardens.

Gujarat Titans bolstered their chances of qualifying for the IPL 2025 playoffs following their convincing 39-run win against Kolkata Knight Riders at the Eden Gardens on Monday night. The win maintained GT's foothold at the top of the IPL points table with 12 points from eight matches - winning six and losing two.Delhi Capitals, Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Punjab Kings occupy the remain three playoff spots.KKR, meanwhile, remain seventh as they picked up their second straight loss in the season. They are on six points after eight matches - winning three and losing five. They are still in contention for playoffs but will have to pull up their socks if they are to go through without a hiccup considering the table is tight above them with four teams on 10 points and Mumbai Indians on eight points.Captain Ajinkya Rahane emerged as KKR's primary fight, scoring a determined 50 off 36 balls with five boundaries and a six as they chased 199 runs. His innings concluded when Washington Sundar had him stumped in the 13th over.The middle order's collapse followed quickly as Venkatesh Iyer and Rahane followed in quick succession followed by the same episode with the wickets of Andre Russell and Ramandeep Singh.Prasidh Krishna delivered a double strike in the 17th over, removing both Ramandeep Singh and Moeen Ali, further diminishing KKR's chances of victory.In the first innings, GT skipper Shubman Gill led the scoring with a brilliant 90 runs off 55 balls, helping GT set a challenging total of 198/3 in 20 overs.On a slow surface, GT struggled initially, managing only 45 runs in the powerplay, but they accelerated their scoring afterward. Gill and B Sai Sudharsan, who scored 52, formed a formidable opening partnership of 114 runs.Jos Buttler added a quick 41 not out from just 23 deliveries, capitalising on some fielding mistakes by KKR. However, it raised questions about GT's risk management, as they could only muster 59 runs in the last five overs.","Gujarat Titans remain top of the IPL 2025 points table following their win against Kolkata Knight Riders at the Eden Gardens on April 21.

How has MS Dhoni performed as IPL's oldest uncapped player?

NEW DELHI: As the Indian Premier League 2025 crosses its halfway mark, it's not just the superstars who have made headlines.This season has witnessed an exciting surge of uncapped players stepping into the spotlight, proving their mettle in high-pressure situations.While legends like MS Dhoni, who entered the league as an uncapped player due to a rule change, continue to draw crowds, it's the lesser-known names: Digvesh Rathi, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, and Ashwani Kumar, among others, who’ve turned heads and started carving their own legacy.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Among the uncapped bowlers, Digvesh Rathi of Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) has arguably been the most consistent.In eight matches so far, the leggie has picked up nine wickets at an economy of 7.43, a commendable rate in today’s batting-dominant format.His best of 2/30 might not be headline-grabbing, but Rathi’s control and temperament under pressure, powered by his unorthodox bowling action, have added real depth to LSG’s bowling arsenal.Close on his heels is Kolkata Knight Riders ' Vaibhav Arora, whose eight wickets in just six matches have come at a strike rate of 16.12.QUIZ: Who's that IPL player? While his economy (9.11) suggests a bit of leakage, Arora’s knack for breakthroughs has made him invaluable.Mumbai Indians' Vignesh Puthur has been a revelation in fewer opportunities: six wickets in four matches at a superb average of 15.66.However, it’s Ashwani Kumar who provided one of the most eye-catching performances of the season. He notched a four-wicket haul in his maiden league appearance, becoming the first Indian to take four wickets on IPL debut.If MI use him smartly in the latter half, he could turn into a late-season X-factor.Meanwhile, some uncapped bowlers have struggled to adapt. Simarjeet Singh, Prince Yadav, and Yash Thakur have all gone for 10-plus runs an over, with high bowling averages and minimal impact.While these young guns show promise, the pressure of the IPL spotlight is clearly a tough crucible.Another name making waves is Punjab's Priyansh Arya, who smacked a blistering 103 against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in his fourth IPL start. Currently, he boasts a mind-boggling strike rate of over 200.With 254 runs, he’s played the aggressor’s role to perfection.Teammates Nehal Wadhera and Prabhsimran Singh have added substance to Punjab’s batting, with both showing improved shot selection and situational awareness.Abishek Porel (DC) and Amanjot Raghuvanshi (KKR) have been steady performers in the middle order, while Aniket Verma (SRH), with a strike rate of 187.05, has delivered explosive cameos that have turned matches.Asutosh Sharma has emerged as Delhi’s clutch finisher, striking at 178.94 with a cool head and a fearless blade in the death overs.However, not all uncapped batters have flourished.Naman Dhir, Ramandeep Singh, and Sameer Rizvi have had underwhelming runs, showing flashes of brilliance but lacking consistency.Even as these youngsters make their mark, MS Dhoni’s presence continues to be magnetic. Albeit, considering the 43-year-old -- who played over 500 matches for India -- qualifies as an uncapped player by a rule change, the comparisons are hardly like-for-like.On the face of it, the numbers paint a rosy picture. Batting precariously down the order, the former Indian skipper has scored 134 runs in 8 matches with a stunning strike rate of 152.27.Again, considering he's no ordinary 'uncapped' player, these are paltry returns for someone of his experience.As some of these names, such as Rathi, bring their names into a conversation for national team selection, if there's one certainty in IPL, it's that heroes can emerge from the unlikeliest corners, and maybe we can find a new one today?",Digvesh Rathi leads the pack of uncapped bowlers in IPL 2025. Ashwani Kumar is the first Indian to take four wickets on IPL debut. Priyansh Arya boasts a mind- boggling strike rate of over 200.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120454763,imgsize-53878,width-400,resizemode-4/MS-Dhoni-and-Digvesh-Rathi-BCCI-Photos.jpg"

Kolkata: It was another case of meek surrender by Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), who suffered back-to-back defeats as they went down to Gujarat Titans by 39 runs at the Eden Gardens here on Monday. This was the Knights’ third loss in four home matches.Table-toppers GT’s top-three batters continued to make merry as Shubman Gill, Sai Sudharsan and Jos Buttler once again got the runs to help them put up 198/3 after KKR skipper Ajinkya Rahane won the toss and elected to field.KKR’s chase never got going as they lost openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz, coming in for Quinton de Kock, and Sunil Narine early, and managed only 45/2 in the Powerplay. Both Rahane and Venkatesh Iyer found it difficult to keep the scoreboard moving.They failed to find a single boundary in 34 balls between the fifth and 11th overs. As Iyer and Rahane (50 off 36 balls) departed in quick succession, it was left to Rinku Singh and Andre Russell to find a way. However, the duo struggled against some tight bowling as KKR ended up at 159/8.Earlier, Gill and Sudharsan got off to a sedate start. With the ball not coming on to the bat in the early stages of the match, the duo concentrated on singles and converting the ones into twos. Former Knight Gill cherished his return to the Eden with a well-paced innings, accelerating after settling down.Gill missed out on what would have been a welldeserved century, falling for 90 (55 balls; 10x4, 3x6). Russell finally got the breakthrough in the 13th over by having Sudharsan caught behind by Gurbaz for 52 (36b, 4x6, 1x6). But Jos Buttler (41 not out off 23b; 8x4), who had two tons and a fifty from seven innings at the Eden, picked up from where he left in the last match against Delhi Capitals, in which he had scored an unbeaten 97, hitting Russell for three consecutive boundaries.The Englishman was dropped on 17 by Vaibhav Arora, who failed to latch on to a skier running backward at mid-off. But with the platform well set to go for big shots, Buttler continued to play his strokes, including his signature reverse sweep, hitting Rana for two boundaries as GT reached 150 in 15.5 overs.With none of the KKR bowlers succeeding in creating an impression, GT batters stepped on the gas, getting 81 runs in the seven overs between 7th and 13th. The Buttler-Gill duo raced to 50 runs off 31 balls before Gill perished to a well-judged catch by Rinku Singh at mid-wicket off Arora. Buttler’s love affair with the Eden continued as he helped GT score 59 runs off the last five overs.","Gujarat Titans beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 39 runs at the Eden Gardens.

Poll What do you think about the pitch conditions at Eden Gardens for KKR? Favours the opposition Balanced for both teams Not suitable for spinners

The Cricket Association of Bengal has requested BCCI to remove commentators Harsha Bhogle and Simon Doull from Kolkata Knight Riders' home matches after they publicly criticised the Eden Gardens curator. The controversy emerged when Doull suggested KKR should relocate if they don't get spin-friendly tracks, while Bhogle supported the team's right to home advantage during a panel discussion following KKR's losses in two of their first three home games.CAB secretary Naresh Ojha sent a formal complaint to BCCI about ten days ago seeking their removal from the commentary panel for home games.Neither Bhogle nor Doull were present for commentary during Monday's KKR versus Gujarat Titans match, though sources close to Bhogle claimed he wasn't scheduled for any KKR games.""Bhogle and Doull are no longer part of the IPL commentary team for KKR's home matches. However, the situation might change when Eden hosts the Qualifier 2 and the Final on May 23 and 25,"" a CAB official told PTI.The controversy intensified after KKR's team management expressed disappointment over pitch conditions. Both captain Ajinkya Rahane and head coach Chandrakant Pandit were unhappy about not getting spin-friendly tracks.After KKR's loss to Lucknow Super Giants in a high-scoring game, Rahane expressed his frustration at the post-match press conference, stating, ""There was no help for the spinners, let me make that clear,"" and suggested further comments could create controversy.During the expert panel discussion, Doull had strongly criticised the curator's stance: ""If he (the curator) is not taking heed of what the home team wants... they are paying the stadium fees, they are paying for what's going on in the IPL. If he's still not listening, then just move the franchise away. His job is not to pass an opinion on the game. That's not what he's paid for.""Bhogle supported this view, saying: ""If they are playing at home, they should get the kind of tracks that suit their bowlers. I saw something about what the KKR curator has said.""The KKR management had reportedly requested surfaces favouring their spin bowlers Varun Chakravarthy, Sunil Narine, and Moeen Ali.CAB has defended their curator Sujan Mukherjee, stating he has followed BCCI guidelines which prohibit franchises from influencing pitch preparation.In the match against LSG that sparked the controversy, LSG posted 238/3 while KKR managed 234/7 in response.CAB president Snehasish Ganguly and secretary Naresh Ojha were unavailable for comments on the matter.",CAB has requested BCCI to remove commentators Harsha Bhogle and Simon Doull from Kolkata Knight Riders' home matches.

Vaibhav Suryavanshi , at 14 years and 23 days old, became the youngest IPL debutant when Rajasthan Royals introduced him as an impact player during their chase against Lucknow Super Giants in Jaipur last Saturday.Despite his impressive 34 runs off 20 balls, including a first-ball six off Shardul Thakur, the Royals faced a narrow two-run defeat.The young talent was acquired by Rajasthan Royals for Rs 1.1 crore during last year's mega auction in Saudi Arabia. He had previously performed well for the Indian U-19 team, scoring 176 runs at an average of 44 in the U-19 Asia Cup last year.Suryavanshi broke the previous record held by Prayas Ray Barman, who debuted at 16 years and 157 days for Royal Challengers Bengaluru against Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2022.Former Pakistani player Basit Ali praised Suryavanshi's bold approach: ""The 14-year-old kid, Vaibhav Suryavanshi.

We need to be more proactive all the way through: Stephen Fleming

Poll What do you think about Ayush Mhatre's potential as a cricketer? He will be a future star It's too early to tell He needs more experience He has great potential

There is an old video of Mumbai and Chennai Super Kings ' new wonderkid, Ayush Mhatre , doing the rounds. In the video, which has gone viral now, Ayush, a toddler back then, is asked about his age: ""Six,"" he replies. Where do you stay, the interviewer asks him. ""Virar,"" he responds in a squeaky voice. “Isn’t it far from here (Churchgate). How do you commute?” he is asked. ""Train,"" he replies, before asserting: ""I want to be a batsman.""Subsequently, Ayush's grandfather (maternal) Laxmikant Anand Naik is asked why he has brought a six-year-old kid for learning cricket lessons at the Dilip Vengsarkar Cricket Academy: ""I wanted to bring him here as I saw his talent. Whether he becomes something is up to his luck, it's my duty to provide him with an opportunity. The whole world knows about Vengsarkar. I thought that he will learn cricket under his tutelage.""Indeed, there are similarities that Mhatre, the latest Mumbai cricket sensation, shares with the city's last two explosive batting talents: Prithvi Shaw-like Prithvi he belongs to Mumbai's furthest -suburb called Virar (it’s the last station on the western line), and Yashasvi Jaiswal (he too has trained at Vengsarkar's academy at the Oval maidan at Churchgate).Astonishing people about his cricketing skills from a young age is something that Ayush began doing almost a decade earlier. ""He was actually just five when that video was shot. As a five-year-old, he played a match with the leather cricket ball with kids who were at least 12-years old. Vengsarkar sir gave him a lot of exposure at such a young age. Eventually, he had to leave Vengsarkar sir's academy after three years as there was too much travelling involved, getting up at 5am and going from Virar to Churchgate. At the age of 10, he joined the MIG Cricket Club, where he trains under Prashant Shetty and Sachin Koli. Both Vengsarkar and MIG CC didn’t charge him a rupee for coaching. At the age of 13, he played for Sainath Sports Club (in Virar), who boldly played him in 'A' division tournaments in Mumbai. After the exposure that he got there, he didn't look back. Even today, he plays for Sainath SC. This journey hasn’t been easy. So many people have supported him,"" Ayush's father Yogesh Mhahtre a banker, told TOI, still pinching himself that his son, playing for a team captained by the iconic MS Dhoni, blasted an eye-catching 15-ball 32, which included four sixes and two fours against Mumbai Indians to win the hearts of the packed crowd at the Wankhede Stadium, millions watching on telly and former cricketing greats like Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri in the commentary.""I don't have words to describe my emotions. He's always been a fearless batsman. He just looks to enjoy himself in the middle, doesn't think too much, or takes pressure. As a parent, I was a bit nervous about his IPL debut yesterday..there’s is so much noise, crowd, music..he has never played in such an atmosphere before. However, he seemed to be cool and clear about what he needed and wanted to do! He's someone who'll play for the team, not himself. Even on his first-class debut (in the Irani Cup clash against Rest of India at Lucknow in Oct last year), he charged on the front foot and smashed Mukesh Kumar for a four, despite Mumbai having been reduced to six for two on Day One. He's not someone who will play for his place in the side. He doesn't play for milestones like 50s or 100s.I've also told him: 'If you get out on 90, then also I'll feel proud about you. making a century is in God's hands, don't run after milestones. Just follow your passion,' I've told him,"" Mhatre senior said.""I'm so proud that he is playing for CSK under a legend like MS Dhoni, who has achieved everything in the game. He can learn so much from him. He's really enjoying the environment at CSK. They have made him feel so relaxed, and not someone playing in his debut IPL season. I hope he continues this approach, provides happiness to everyone and goes on to play for India eventually. This is just the start, an important step,"" the proud father added.Mhatre's childhood hero is Indian captain Rohit Sharma , who smashed 76 not out off 45 balls to seal MI's nine-wicket win on Sunday night, in the process taking the young man the value of finishing the job after the initial assault. ""He started playing cricket after watching Rohit bat. You can see in his batting style that he idolises Rohit. When I spoke to him last night, Ayush was more happy and proud about chatting with Rohit yesterday than his own smashing IPL, CSK and T20 debut,"" Yogesh said.A solid supporter of Mhatre till now has been India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav , not surprising since in recent times, quite a few youngsters, including Abhishek Sharma, have credited SKY for the role he has played in encouraging them. ""Surya has always supported him at every point. He keeps talking to Ayush, sends him encouraging messages boosting his morale. Even yesterday, Surya gifted him a bat, something which he keeps doing,"" Yogesh revealed. ""I think that Ayush has more bats of Surya than Surya himself,"" he said in jest.Showering praise on Mhatre, Mumbai chief selector Sanjay Patil told TOI: ""His improvisation and timing were superb last night. He has tremendous talent. The best thing about him is that his temperament is very good. This was his IPL debut, but he had no nerves. He doesn’t take stress, and I saw that during his debut at the Irani Cup also last year. He needs to improve his conversation rate, but I can understand since it was just his first match. He will only get better with great players like Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav around to guide him. I saw how quickly he learnt a few things from Mumbai captain Ajinkya Rahane and Shreyas Iyer during the Ranji Trophy.""""I think he definitely has the potential to go and play for India. I only regret that I couldn't play him against Jammu & Kashmir in a Ranji Trophy match last season, because all our senior India players were available for that match,"" he added.After he scored 176 against Maharashtra at BKC in the Ranji Trophy, Mhatre was signed up by SG, who sponsor his cricketing kit and provide him with bats. if he keeps smashing the ball like that, expect more such deals to come the Virat lad's way.","Ayush Mhatre made his IPL debut for Chennai Super Kings against Mumbai Indians on Sunday. He hit 32 runs in 15 balls, including four sixes and two fours. He has been training at Dilip Vengsarkar's academy since he was five-years-old.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120491625,imgsize-146508,width-400,resizemode-4/Mumbai-Apr-20-ANI-Chennai-Super-Kings-Ayush-Mhatre-plays-a-shot-during-the-.jpg"

Trent Alexander-Arnold fired Liverpool to the brink of the Premier League title as his late strike sealed a 1-0 win that relegated Leicester after Arsenal's 4-0 rout of Ipswich delayed the leaders' coronation on Sunday.Arne Slot's side could have clinched a record-equalling 20th English title with a combination of an Arsenal loss and a victory at the King Power Stadium.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Liverpool fulfilled their half of the equation, but second-placed Arsenal were not so obliging earlier in the afternoon.The Gunners' stroll at Portman Road meant Liverpool kicked off still needing six points from their last six games to seal a first title since 2020.Thanks to Alexander-Arnold's match-winning contribution after coming off the bench, Liverpool are 13 points clear of Arsenal with five games left for both teams.The Reds will seal the title if Arsenal lose at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday or if they beat Tottenham at Anfield on April 27.It looked like being a frustrating day for Liverpool as second-bottom Leicester kept them at bay despite a host of chances for the visitors.Slot's men finally made the breakthrough in the 76th minute when Alexander-Arnold lashed home the rebound from close-range after Mohamed Salah and Diogo Jota both hit the crossbar.With speculation mounting that Alexander-Arnold will join Real Madrid when his contract expires at the end of the season, it was notable that the England right-back embarked on a wild celebration of his winner.Alexander-Arnold earned a booking for ripping off his shirt and planting it on the corner flag after he sprinted to 3,000 jubilant Liverpool fans in one corner of the King Power.""It took us a long time and, of course, a great moment for Trent after working so hard to come back. To score the goal that makes a lot of difference is very special,"" Slot said.""It's never hard to dream (of the title) but you see we are really focused on playing Tottenham.""Liverpool's title celebration is only a matter of time but Leicester will spend next season in the Championship after their woeful one-year stay in the top tier came to an end with a 23rd defeat in 33 league games.Fresh from a famous victory over Real Madrid on Wednesday to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time since 2009, Arsenal ensured Liverpool would not be able to start their party this weekend.Mikel Arteta made only three changes from the 2-1 win in the Spanish capital and was rewarded with a dominant display to kill the game off inside half an hour.""All we can do is delay that moment (Liverpool win the league) from our side to earn the right to finish as high as possible,"" Arteta said.Leandro Trossard was one of those recalled by Arteta and prodded in his eighth goal of the season to open the scoring.A flowing move saw Bukayo Saka's cross flicked by Mikel Merino into the path of Gabriel Martinelli to finish to double the Gunners lead.Moments later, Saka was chopped down by an awful challenge from Leif Davis that saw the Ipswich left-back shown a straight red card.Trossard fired in his second after a well-worked corner before Ethan Nwaneri's deflected effort rounded off the scoring.Defeat realistically ends third-bottom Ipswich's hope of maintaining their Premier League status as they are 15 points adrift of safety with five games remaining and have a significantly poorer goal difference than West Ham.Chelsea needed two late goals at Fulham to revive their chances of Champions League football next season with a dramatic 2-1 victory.Alex Iwobi opened the scoring on 20 minutes and Chelsea were meandering towards a damaging defeat until 19-year-old substitute Tyrique George fired in a snap shot from the edge of the box on 83 minutes.Pedro Neto then completed the comeback with a stunning strike in stoppage-time to secure Chelsea's sixth win in their last 17 league games.Fifth-placed Chelsea moved above Nottingham Forest, who travel to Tottenham on Monday.

Manchester City bolstered their bid to qualify for the Champions League with a dramatic 2-0 win at Everton , while Southampton 's last-gasp equaliser at West Ham ensured they will not have sole possession of the lowest points total in Premier League history.City were heading towards a damaging draw before Nico O'Reilly's 84th minute strike put them on course for a vital victory that was sealed by Mateo Kovacic's goal in the final seconds.Pep Guardiola's side climb to fourth place, four points ahead of sixth-placed Chelsea, who face Fulham on Sunday in their game in hand.Fifth-placed Nottingham Forest , who travel to Tottenham on Monday, are one point adrift of City.At a stage of the season when they are usually embroiled in a battle to win the title, City -- champions in six of the previous seven campaigns -- have been reduced to scrapping for a Champions League berth after a dismal season.They remain on course to achieve their bare minimum target after a hard-fought success on Merseyside.In the 84th minute, Matheus Nunes's low cross into the six-yard box was met by the 20-year-old O'Reilly, who got in front of Michael Keane to poke home from close range.O'Reilly has emerged as an unlikely hero for City after the Manchester-born midfielder scored last week in the win against Crystal Palace and netted twice against Plymouth in the FA Cup.Kovacic wrapped up City's victory on their last visit to Goodison Park before Everton move to a new stadium next season.The Croatian guided Ilkay Gundogan's pass into the bottom corner to give City a third win from their last four league games.""To win here at Goodison Park, where Liverpool and Arsenal couldn't, is massively important,"" Guardiola said.""Now it is in our hands. Three games at home, two away and hopefully we can achieve this big success to qualify for the Champions League.""Relegated Southampton rescued a 1-1 draw at West Ham to guarantee they won't have the indignity of being the lone club with the Premier League's worst ever points tally.Jarrod Bowen struck for the Hammers in the 47th minute, holding off Ryan Manning before lashing a fierce finish past Aaron Ramsdale.But Lesley Ugochukwu equalised three minutes into second half stoppage-time as he lashed past Alphonse Areola.Bottom of the table Southampton are now on 11 points -- the same number Derby managed in 2007-08 -- and have five games left to leave the Rams with the lowest total ever recorded in the Premier League.Brentford beat 10-man Brighton 4-2 to damage the Seagulls' prospects of qualifying for Europe with their first home win since December.Thomas Frank's side took a ninth minute lead when Lewis Keane-Potter's precise pass through the heart of the Brighton defence picked out Bryan Mbeumo and he confidently slotted homeDanny Welbeck hauled Brighton level in first half stoppage-time with a powerful header from Mats Wieffer's cross.Mbeumo restored Brentford's advantage three minutes after half-time, his strike taking a hefty deflection off Brighton defender Lewis Dunk on its way past Bart Verbruggen.Yoane Wissa bagged Brentford's third in the 58th minute, running onto Mbeumo's pass and finishing with the help of a deflection off Jan Paul van Hecke.Brighton striker Joao Pedro was sent off in the 61st minute for a needless kick at Nathan Collins.Japan forward Kaoru Mitoma reduced the deficit in the 81st minute, but Christian Norgaard headed home in stoppage-time to end Brighton's hopes of a late escape.Crystal Palace held on for a 0-0 draw against Bournemouth despite playing half the match with 10 men.Palace were reduced to 10 men just before half-time at Selhurst Park when Chris Richards was sent off for a second booking after the defender fouled Justin Kluivert.Third-placed Newcastle will look to step up their Champions League qualification surge when they travel to Aston Villa in Saturday's late game.",Manchester City beat Everton 2-0 in English Premier League.

Barcelona staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Celta Vigo 4-3 at home on Saturday, extending their La Liga lead to seven points over Real Madrid. After trailing 3-1 with less than 30 minutes remaining, Barcelona's Dani Olmo and Raphinha , who scored twice including a 98th-minute penalty, secured the crucial victory.Barcelona took an early lead through Ferran Torres in the 12th minute, who scored from the edge of the box after finding space in Celta's defence.Celta Vigo responded quickly, with Borja Iglesias equalising three minutes later. Pablo Duran's cross found Iglesias, who scored into an empty net after goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny failed to intercept.Barcelona's attempts to regain the lead saw Raphinha sending a free-kick over the bar and Robert Lewandowski missing the target. Szczesny made important saves from Ilaix Moriba and Iker Losada at the other end.Iglesias put Celta ahead early in the second half, capitalizing on Frenkie de Jong's error to score past Szczesny. He later completed his hat-trick after being set up by Sergio Carreira, taking advantage of Barcelona's high defensive line.""This is football, we really wanted to win, maybe we weren't at our best but the response from the team, and the fans pushed us on... we deserved it,"" Olmo told DAZN. ""These are three points that take us closer to our objective, they're important and we have to continue.""Barcelona coach Hansi Flick had initially rested 17-year-old Lamine Yamal for the first time in 2025 but brought him on after Iglesias' third goal.The comeback began when Raphinha assisted Olmo, who beat goalkeeper Vicente Guaita. Raphinha then scored himself, heading in Yamal's cross from the right.Celta missed a chance to secure the win when Oscar Mingueza headed wide from close range in the 90th minute.The decisive moment came in the 96th minute when VAR review led to a penalty after Yoel Lago fouled Olmo. With Lewandowski substituted, Raphinha converted the spot-kick into the top-right corner.""It's a bittersweet feeling... we scored three, which few teams can do here, but it feels bad,"" said Celta's Duran. ""We have to be proud of our team, we came here with personality, played well, had a good plan and carried it out -- but for small details it got away from us.""The victory maintains Barcelona's strong position in the title race, with Real Madrid set to face Athletic Bilbao on Sunday and a Clasico matchup scheduled for May.Celta Vigo, currently seventh in La Liga and competing for European qualification, showed attacking prowess throughout the match despite the eventual defeat.","Barcelona come from behind to defeat Celta Vigo 4-3 in La Liga.

Manchester, Apr 18, 2025 -Manchester United came from 4-2 down in extra-time to beat Lyon 5-4 in a remarkable Europa League quarter-final to progress 7-6 on aggregate on Thursday.United's season looked over when Lyon came from 2-0 down to lead by two goals with just six minutes remaining at Old Trafford despite having captain Corentin Tolisso sent off.However, a Bruno Fernandes ' penalty, Kobbie Mainoo's strike and Harry Maguire's header capped a stunning finale to set up a semi-final meeting with Athletic Bilbao.""I felt that here everything is possible,"" said United boss Ruben Amorim . ""After the 4-3, the penalty from Bruno, you feel that you can change the game.""The Red Devils sit 14th in the English top flight and defeat would have almost certainly meant missing out on European football entirely next season.Instead they are just three games away from a European trophy and the lifeline of direct access to the riches of the Champions League next season.""Everybody in this moment believes it is possible,"" added Amorim.""One moment can change a lot of things in the players' minds.""United's history is built on dramatic late fightbacks, but few have been more remarkable than this to leave Lyon shellshocked.The home side got off to a flying start thanks to a fine team goal as Fernandes released Alejandro Garnacho down the right and his cross picked out Ugarte to slot in just his second goal since joining the English giants from Paris Saint-Germain.Amorim's decision to restore Andre Onana in goal was under scrutiny.The Cameroonian had been dropped for Sunday's 4-1 thrashing at Newcastle after two costly errors that led to both Lyon's goals in last week's 2-2 first leg draw.Those mistakes came after a war of words with former United midfielder Nemanja Matic, who labelled him ""one of the worst goalkeepers in United's history"".The 29-year-old rewarded his manager's faith with a couple of important stops to prevent Lyon levelling through Paul Akouokou and Rayan Cherki.At the other end, a United side that have often looked laboured and lacking in ideas all season, suddenly clicked into gear in the first 45 minutes.United doubled their lead in first-half stoppage time when Maguire's long ball was expertly controlled by Diogo Dalot, who then fired in off the inside of the post.Garnacho should have killed the tie off within minutes of the restart for the second half when he shot straight at Lucas Perri with Fernandes begging for a pass for a tap in.But the defensive deficiencies and mental fragility of Amorim's side were exposed in a collapse that threatened to cap a miserable campaign.Alexandre Lacazette flicked on Moussa Niakhate's header and Corentin Tolisso swooped to head in and give the visitors a lifeline.Nicolas Tagliafico then prodded in at the back post despite Onana's attempt to scoop it off the line.Just as Lyon were in the ascendency Tolisso gave them a mountain to climb again with a soft second yellow for a trip on Casemiro.Yet, it did not initially matter as Cherki confirmed his status as one of Europe's rising stars with a powerful drive that left Onana motionless.Lyon's other prized asset, Malick Fofana, was then chopped down by Luke Shaw inside the area and Lacazette confidently dispatched the resulting spot-kick.Another penalty at the other end, though, kickstarted the fightback as Fernandes fired home after a VAR review for a foul on Casemiro.Substitute Mainoo showed why he had been thrust in an unfamiliar forward role with a composed finish to level on 120 minutes.Barely 60 seconds later Maguire completed the comeback with a towering header at the back post.""In this moment it is difficult to believe what has just happened,"" said Lyon coach Paulo Fonseca.It is the first time ever in European competition that five goals have been scored in extra-time.",Manchester United came from 4-2 down in extra-time to beat Lyon 5-4 in a remarkable Europa League quarter-final to progress 7-6 on aggregate.

""We knew we were going to suffer, but we knew we were going to win. We had it in our minds and now we've done it in real life.""The match's momentum shifted early when VAR overturned a penalty for Real Madrid following a hold on Kylian Mbappé, after a five-minute review with the score at 0-0.Arsenal had earlier missed their own VAR-awarded penalty when Bukayo Saka failed to convert from the spot.Saka later redeemed himself by scoring in the 65th minute after receiving a pass from Mikel Merino, though Madrid quickly equalized through Vinícius Júnior following a defensive error by William Saliba.Gabriel Martinelli sealed Arsenal's victory with a stoppage-time goal, assisted by Merino.""This is one of the best nights in my football career, for sure,"" Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta said. ""It's a really special one against a team that has been an inspiration for a lot of us in this competition. To win this tie in the manner that we have, we can be very proud.""Mbappé's substitution in the 75th minute due to an apparent injury drew jeers from some Bernabeu supporters, marking another disappointing Champions League campaign for the French star.""It's a tough moment,"" Madrid's Lucas Vazquez said. ""We tried but in the end we couldn't achieve our goal. We'll come back stronger. Madrid always does.""Real Madrid's task was challenging from the outset, facing an Arsenal team that hadn't lost by a three-goal margin in nearly three years. Only four teams in Champions League history had overcome a three-goal first-leg deficit at home.The match began with early drama as Madrid had a goal disallowed after two minutes when Mbappé was caught offside.Arsenal maintained their unbeaten record against Real Madrid, extending it to four matches, including their previous Champions League knockout stage victory in 2005-06.The game featured significant VAR involvement, with Arsenal's penalty awarded after review showed Raúl Asencio holding Mikel Merino during a corner kick.Another VAR review led to the reversal of Madrid's penalty claim after initially being awarded for a hold on Mbappé by Rice.The victory marks Arsenal's return to the Champions League semifinals after a 15-year absence, with their last appearance ending in elimination by Manchester United in 2008-09.",Arsenal defeat Real Madrid 2-1 in Champions League quarterfinals.

The seven-person medical team faces up to 25 years in prison for alleged negligence in the football legend's final days.Maradona passed away at age 60 while recovering at home from surgery to remove a blood clot in his brain.

How Norman Nato, Nyck De Vries fared in

Miami E-Prix

Formula E drivers Norman Nato and Nyck De Vries are currently in Italy for the second round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC). They participated in the 6 Hours of Imola Qualifying on Saturday, moving a step closer to the main race. Nato finished 9th, while De Vries secured 5th place in the session.Norman Nato, who races for Nissan in the Formula E Championship, represents Cadillac Racing in collaboration with Hertz Team Jota in the Hypercar category of the Endurance Championship. Nyck De Vries, from Mahindra Racing’s Formula E team, finished 5th in the Imola qualifying. He competes for Toyota Gazoo Racing in the WEC, alongside teammate Ryo Hirakawa, who placed 4th in qualifying.Calling it his best effort on track, De Vries told Toyota Europe Newsroom: “As a team, I think we can be fairly satisfied with qualifying fourth and fifth here. We maximised our package, as you can see from the tiny gap between the two cars. I don’t think we could have done much better than that; we did a strong job to execute a clean qualifying. The gap to the front cars looks quite big over one lap, but we will do our best with race pace, tyre management, and strategy to challenge for the podium.”Both drivers are now set to compete in the final race of the 6 Hours of Imola on Sunday, scheduled from 1 PM to 7 PM local time.In their last Formula E outing at the Homestead-Miami Speedway, Nato faced heartbreak after losing what looked like a sure win due to post-race penalties. Although he clinched pole and crossed the line first at the Miami E-Prix, he was relegated to 6th place in the revised results.De Vries had qualified 5th in Miami but ultimately dropped to 11th in the final standings after penalties were applied.Following this, they’ll shift focus to Round 6 of the Formula E World Championship—the highly anticipated Monaco double-header on May 3 and 4. With momentum building, fans of both electric and endurance racing will be keeping a close eye on their performances.Also Read: Following Miami E-Prix setback, Formula E driver Norman Nato gears up for Endurance race in Italy, greets fans with ""Buongiorno""","Formula E drivers Norman Nato and Nyck De Vries are currently in Italy for the second round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) They participated in the 6 Hours of Imola Qualifying on Saturday, moving a step closer to the main race.

Overwhelmed with emotion, Di Grassi was heard screaming with excitement in the car as it crossed the finish line and headed to the paddock. His family also joined him on the podium to share the special moment.Lucas Di Grassi opens up on his long journey to podiumLucas Di Grassi had not scored a podium in the last two years with Lola Yamaha ABT, and he expressed the frustration that had been building up during that time, as his hard work wasn’t translating into results. His last podium came in Season 9, when he was part of Mahindra Racing.The 40-year-old shared his journey to the podium after the win. He said, “It’s very hard to start the project from zero so in the four races, I had four critical problems that pretty much didn’t allow me to finish the race. So I was like, it’s extremely (tough), you need to have a lot of discipline to be able to continue the work and continue to push when you have bad results.”“When you have good results, it’s very easy. But when you have bad results, to go back home, keep the focus, keep the head down and keep doing the work that you do that at one point it’s going to pay off. It’s hard because you work, it doesn’t. Then you work again, it doesn’t pay off again. And then you keep working until it pays off. And today was a day it paid off. So I am very happy.”It was also emotional to see Di Grassi’s wife, Bianca Diniz Caloi, and their young children standing alongside him on the podium as they popped the champagne. Buzzing with confidence, the driver is now aiming to keep the momentum going at the next race in Monaco. The double-header is scheduled for May 3 and 4.Di Grassi was promoted to second place after a series of post-race penalties altered the fate of several drivers who had finished ahead of him, including the original winner, Norman Nato.

How Nico Mueller secured the top spot

Andretti driver Nico Mueller and his race engineer Bertrand Mermine have surged to the top of the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard following a dramatic Miami Grand Prix, where post-race penalties reshuffled the final standings in Mueller’s favour. Though he originally crossed the line in 10th, Mueller was promoted to 4th, thanks to a well-timed strategy and a dash of late-race chaos. His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace. The season concludes with an award for the top-ranked pairing.After Round 5 in Miami, the leaderboard has Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne and his race engineer Thibault Arnal on number 2. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries and race engineer Tom Bayles are in third position in the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard.The FIA Formula E Instagram account also shared the update, posting:“@nico.mueller51 overtaking his way up the rankings! With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued. Drivers including Norman Nato, Robin Frijns, Oliver Rowland, Sam Bird, and Taylor Barnard were penalized 10 seconds each for misuse of Attack Mode, while Nick Cassidy received a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits.Also Read: Formula E Miami E-Prix 2025: Jake Hughes crashes at chicane, here’s how the multi-car collision changed the outcome.

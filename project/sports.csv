Fans throw objects, vandalise stadium after Messi leaves early | Hyderabad next

Former India cricketer Manoj Tiwari launched a scathing attack on the organisers and authorities after chaos marred Lionel Messi’s much-hyped appearance at Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday, saying a global icon like the Argentine superstar “deserved better”.“I am speechless of what happened today in my city! This is shambolic! Me, being an international sportsperson can feel how embarrassing it was for Messi today. We all love him and the craze was well anticipated! Organizer Satadru has already been arrested and I thank the police department for the prompt action. The way Satadru played with the hard-earned money and emotion of the football-loving people of Bengal today at the Salt Lake Stadium, deserves an alarming punishment. .. Another case of False promise and complete mismanagement by Satadru! Thankfully I was not present today... I always had doubt if he had the credibility of pulling off an event like this in Kolkata. A legend like Leo Messi deserved better. I am sure the Government will take strict action against Satadru and management.. Kolkata didn't deserve this!” Tiwari wrote on X.Messi’s much-anticipated visit lasted just 22 minutes, enough to turn what was billed as a historic celebration into a spectacle of mismanagement.More than 50,000 fans, many of whom paid between Rs 4,000 and Rs 12,000, and even higher in the black market, were left frustrated after failing to get a clear glimpse of the World Cup winner.The situation deteriorated rapidly as Messi was surrounded by politicians, VVIPs and security personnel, effectively blocking the view of the paying public.Despite repeated appeals from promoter Satadru Dutta over the public address system to clear the ground, the crowding worsened, forcing Messi’s early exit.Angry fans reacted by throwing bottles and chairs, vandalising canopies and damaging stadium property, prompting police intervention.The unrest lasted over an hour, though police largely showed restraint to prevent a stampede.Messi’s second visit to Kolkata, part of his India tour, was meant to inspire football lovers. Instead, it exposed glaring gaps in planning and crowd control, leaving behind disappointment, damage and serious questions about governance and accountability.","Messi’s second visit to Kolkata, part of his India tour, was meant to inspire football lovers.

Poll Is the trading strategy of including Jadeja and Curran a good move for Rajasthan Royals? Absolutely, it strengthens the team Partially, depends on their form Not at all, they should have kept Samson

Probable XI:

Impact player:

NEW DELHI: The Rajasthan Royals arrive at the IPL Auction 2026 carrying more context than most teams at the table. Few franchises have experienced such sharp swings in direction within a single year. The Royals’ journey into this mini-auction has been anything but linear, spanning a third-place finish in 2024 to a disastrous season this year, Rahul Dravid replacing Kumar Sangakkara as head coach and then exiting, and then Sangakkara returning once again.And yet, beneath the noise, there is a sense that Rajasthan may finally have addressed their most fundamental cricketing problem.The trade window told that story clearly. Trading away Sanju Samson - their captain, most capped player, highest run scorer, and long-time face of the franchise - was a seismic move. But in terms of squad construction, it was also deeply calculated. Rajasthan did not just trade Samson to Chennai Super Kings. They converted one INR 18 crore player into two genuine all rounders. Ravindra Jadeja arrived at INR 14 crore, four less than his previous valuation, while Sam Curran came in at a remarkable INR 2.4 crore. Two players, both capable of influencing games in multiple phases, acquired for less than the cost of Samson alone.This matters because for the last cycle, despite their strong finishes, Rajasthan were structurally incomplete. They played most seasons with six specialist batters and five specialist bowlers. There was no glue in between. That imbalance repeatedly showed itself in pressure situations. The management often had to push R Ashwin up the order, not as a tactical weapon, but as a necessity to stretch batting depth. Even their attempt to fix this at the mega auction through Wanindu Hasaranga only partially worked. Hasaranga delivered wickets, but his inability to contribute with the bat left the core issue unresolved.The Samson-Jadeja-Curran deal changes that entirely. Rajasthan now have genuine batting till eight without compromising bowling quality. It is the single most important correction they have made in years.Their top order remains the strongest and most exciting part of the squad. Yashasvi Jaiswal continues to be the cornerstone, combining volume with aggression. Alongside him, Vaibhav Suryavanshi was the breakout story of IPL 2025. Thrust into the XI due to Samson’s injury, the 14-year-old did not just survive, he dominated. His 252 runs in seven matches, highlighted by a breathtaking 35-ball hundred against Gujarat Titans, powered Rajasthan to the best powerplay strike rate in the league. No team matched their intent in the first six overs.However, this is also where risk creeps in. Suryavanshi is still a teenager. Second-season pressure, opposition planning, and the grind of a full IPL campaign can be unforgiving. With Nitish Rana traded away and Lhuan-dre Pretorius the only specialist back-up, Rajasthan are one injury or loss of form away from being stretched thin at the top. Expect them to quietly look for a domestic top-order option who can step in without disrupting the balance. Players like Prithvi Shaw, Mayank Agarwal, Rahul Tripathi, Deepak Hooda, or even Venkatesh Iyer offer varying combinations of experience, versatility, and short-term cover without forcing a structural rethink.The middle order, long a source of frustration, looks more settled on paper. Riyan Parag has grown into his role as a spin hitter and stabiliser. Dhruv Jurel provides calmness and game awareness and, with Samson’s departure, is likely to bat slightly higher, a role that suits his temperament and shot selection. The finishing, however, remains a mixed bag. Shimron Hetmyer endured an underwhelming season, both in output and impact, especially in the final five overs where Rajasthan ranked among the worst teams for runs, strike rate, and boundary percentage. The addition of Donovan Ferreira gives them a second finishing option, but the lack of proven Indian power hitters means the depth is still fragile in high-pressure chases. Abhinav Manohar, available at the auction, could be a smart target here. His ability to bat anywhere between four and seven and clear the ropes against pace makes him a practical, budget-friendly solution to a long-standing issue.Bowling is where the auction will truly define Rajasthan’s season.Releasing Wanindu Hasaranga and Maheesh Theekshana has left a glaring hole in the spin department. At present, Jadeja and Riyan Parag are the only spin options. Last season’s experiment of playing two overseas spinners backfired badly, both tactically and structurally. The Royals are determined not to repeat that mistake. Securing a frontline Indian spinner is now non-negotiable.Ravi Bishnoi sits at the top of their wishlist. Despite two ordinary seasons at Lucknow Super Giants, his age, skill set, and experience make him a long-term asset. Rahul Chahar is another profile that fits Rajasthan’s needs. Either would allow the Royals to control the middle overs, reduce pressure on the seamers, and free up their overseas combinations. The challenge, of course, is budget. With only INR 16.05 crore, the fourth-lowest purse at the auction, Rajasthan will need discipline and timing to win that battle.The pace attack has its own concerns. Jofra Archer remains a match winner, but his fitness record offers no guarantees. Sandeep Sharma brings control, but not pace. Tushar Deshpande and Yudhvir Singh provide depth, but lack a proven death overs skill set. Rajasthan had the worst economy in both powerplay and death overs last season, a stat that underlines their need for a specialist who can execute yorkers and variations under pressure. Someone like Mustafizur Rahman, with past experience at the franchise, could be a pragmatic solution. Matheesha Pathirana is another tempting option, but given Rajasthan’s limited budget and his likely price, securing him appears highly unlikely.Rajasthan also have two exciting overseas fast-bowling prospects in Nandre Burger and Kwena Maphaka. Both offer pace and wicket-taking potential, but playing either would mean compromising on an overseas slot elsewhere, a trade-off the Royals will have to consider carefully given their already tight overseas balance.As they stand, Rajasthan Royals are closer to a balanced XI than they have been in a long time.Yashasvi Jaiswal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel, Shimron Hetmyer, Donovan Ferreira, Ravindra Jadeja, Sam Curran, Jofra Archer, Sandeep Sharma, Indian spinnerTushar DeshpandeThe Royals may not dominate the auction headlines, but if they secure a quality Indian spinner and one smart pace bowling addition, they could quietly walk away as one of the most improved sides. For a franchise that has chased balance for nearly a decade, this auction is not about ambition. It is about finally completing the puzzle.","Rajasthan Royals have made a number of changes to their squad for the IPL Auction 2026. Trading Sanju Samson to Chennai Super Kings was a seismic move.

'Will get international matches back to Chinnaswamy' | Venkatesh Prasad EXCLUSIVE

BENGALURU: The past week has been a beehive of activity for the newly elected Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) regime led by former India pacer Venkatesh Prasad . After Sunday’s elections and assuming office on Monday, Prasad and his team got down to work immediately, with their foremost priority being the resumption of competitive cricket at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium — with spectators in attendance.With the state government giving its nod for hosting the 2026 Indian Premier League season at the venue, contingent on implementing the recommendations of the Justice John Michael D’Cunha Commission, Prasad told TOI on Friday that the association has already begun acting on those directives.“The safety of spectators is paramount for us, and we will do everything to ensure that,” Prasad said. “During the election campaign, we promised to bring matches back and restore the image of our stadium and association. We will live up to that.”Prasad added that the KSCA has already met the chief minister and deputy chief minister, in addition to holding discussions with key stakeholders. “We have had positive meetings with senior officials from the police and fire departments. We’ve sought their guidance in ensuring we meet all norms. We are not waiting for anyone to reach out to us; we are taking the initiative,” he said.While some items on the police checklist issued on August 19 have already been addressed, Prasad said the rest will be implemented in phases.Given the scale of the recommendations, especially the civil works, the upgrades are likely to take time. Widening entry gates to a minimum of six feet, installing baggage scanners at all points of entry (even though spectators are not permitted to carry bags), upgrading focused CCTV coverage, and modifying entry and exit pathways are among the more complex tasks.“While the recommendations are our top priority, we must follow due process. We will need to invite tenders for various works, get approvals from the managing committee, and coordinate with multiple government agencies,” Prasad noted.With deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar stating on Friday that home minister G. Parameshwara has been asked to meet KSCA officials, Prasad confirmed that the association will meet him soon for further discussions.Although the Cunha report stated that the “design and structure” of the stadium were “unsuitable and unsafe” for mass gatherings, the Chinnaswamy Stadium has not witnessed any major mishaps inside the premises before the stampede outside the stadium on June 4. Still, given that the venue is over 50 years old, the need to re-evaluate safety and fire management systems is pressing.One of the biggest challenges in implementing the commission’s recommendations lies in the first two directives, which point to chronic congestion and parking issues during major matches. The report suggests creating pickup and drop-off points, as well as parking spaces for cars and two-wheelers, within the stadium. This directive is impractical, considering that most city-based stadiums across the country lack such capacity. The idea of a holding area for spectators also presents logistical hurdles.With the IPL scheduled to begin on March 21, Prasad and his team are in a race against time to put their house in order — especially since, traditionally, the defending champions (in this case, Royal Challengers Bengaluru) host the season opener.","Venkatesh Prasad is the new chairman of the Karnataka State Cricket Association.

Former Indian cricket player Robin Uthappa criticized India's batting approach during their 51-run defeat against South Africa in the second T20I at Mullanpur on Thursday, highlighting concerns about role clarity and excessive batting flexibility in the early innings while chasing a target of 214 runs.India was bowled out for 162 in 19.1 overs, failing to reach the challenging target set by South Africa.Uthappa specifically pointed out the strategic decision after Shubman Gill 's dismissal, when Axar Patel came in to bat despite having several batting options available.""When Shubman Gill got out, Axar Patel walked in with plenty of batting still to come. At that stage, he had to play the role of a pinch-hitter -- someone you are willing to risk early to get quick runs and take pressure off Abhishek Sharma,"" Uthappa said on Jio Hotstar.According to Uthappa, Axar's cautious approach of scoring 21 runs at a run-a-ball rate increased pressure on the team and affected the chase negatively.""At the international level, batters need clear roles and a clear idea of how they're going to construct an innings,"" he said.""Flexibility with match-ups after the first six to eight overs is fine, but you still need a solid foundation before you can chase a big score -- you can't build a skyscraper without a base.""The 2007 T20 World Cup winner emphasized the importance of having defined roles early in the innings.""Asking players to prepare for multiple roles in the same game makes run-scoring more complicated, and that's where India are missing a trick.

Ryan ten Doeschate backs under-fire Suryakumar Yadav, Shubman Gill to regain form

India’s T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav is facing scrutiny over a prolonged dip in form, having gone 20 innings without a fifty. Since November, the middle-order batter has scored just 227 runs at an average of 13.35, with his struggles continuing in the ongoing home series against South Africa, where he managed scores of 12 and 5 in the first two matches.The extended lean patch has prompted former India batter Aakash Chopra to weigh in on Yadav’s form and his responsibilities as captain.""You are the team's captain, but a captain's job is not just to toss and manage the bowlers. It's not just about making the strategy.

If you have an average of 14 in 17 innings and the strike rate is also not very good, you don't have a single fifty, and have crossed 25 just twice, it's been a problem on either side of the IPL,"" he added.While raising concerns, Chopra was careful to clarify his position on Yadav’s leadership role ahead of the T20 World Cup 2026, scheduled to be held in India and Sri Lanka in February–March.""I am not saying there is any doubt over Suryakumar Yadav's captaincy, or that he won't be India's captain in the World Cup.I am not suggesting that at all, but the truth is that he needs to score runs,"" Chopra explained.The former India cricketer underlined the importance of strong performances from both the captain and vice-captain going into the global event.""If you are playing at No. 3 or No. 4 and are not scoring runs, and they aren't being scored consistently and over a long period of time, you won't be that confident when you start the World Cup. So, Suryakumar Yadav, the captain, and Shubman Gill , the vice-captain, scoring runs is absolutely imperative,"" he concluded.",Suryakumar Yadav has gone 20 innings without a fifty. The India captain has scored just 227 runs at an average of 13.35 since November. Former India batter Aakash Chopra has questioned Yadav's captaincy. Chopra was careful to clarify his position on Yadav’s leadership role.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125944116,imgsize-21844,width-400,resizemode-4/suryakumar-1312-afp.jpg"

NEW CHANDIGARH:

Ryan ten Doeschate backs under-fire Suryakumar Yadav, Shubman Gill to regain form

The Indian team came into this T20I series against South Africa with the clear objective of identifying the chinks in the T20 team, with just another five games remaining at home against New Zealand leading up to the T20 World Cup in Feb-March.Instead, a new problem has emerged — the leadership group in the team is woefully short of runs and there seems to be no clear way out.The question needs to be asked: Are captain Suryakumar Yadav and vice-captain Shubman Gill becoming misfits in the playing XI because of their prolonged slump? Gill’s return to the T20I playing XI at the expense of Sanju Samson at the top of the order is unending. The bigger worry, however, is Surya’s prolonged run of poor form since assuming full time T20I captaincy after displacing Hardik Pandya.Since Gautam Gambhir took charge as head coach, there have been many changes in the T20I outfit, especially the emergence of Abhishek Sharma and Tilak Varma and the resurgence of Varun Chakravarthy. The shift happened when most of the country's top resources — which includes the likes of Shubman Gill, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah and Yashasvi Jaiswal — were assigned Test cricket duties.Consumed by the euphoria of this new-look T20I team’s fresh and aggressive brand of cricket, symptoms of Surya’s declining returns went largely unnoticed. That he came out to bat at No. 4 after Axar Patel against a potent South African seam attack on Thursday was a giveaway that the team management is now unsure about Surya’s capability to deliver when it matters.Since November 2024, Surya’s average has been 13.35 at a strike rate of 120 in 20 outings. Those numbers don’t fit the team’s bill. From being dismissive about his form in the Asia Cup a couple of months back, Surya has gone to conceding that he and Gill will have to take more responsibility and not just depend on Abhishek.India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate hinted that both Surya and Gill were perhaps not playing with the mindset that the team expects of them. “If you’re going to be India’s No. 3, there’s pressure on you to score runs. There’s been a fairly long run of form now where he hasn’t got the scores we would like.“Batting at No. 3, the job we want for him is to go out there and attack. He’s been a fantastic leader of this group,” Doeschate said after the defeat in the second T20I here on Thursday night.As for Gill, his T20I approach has been a bit concerning. The sudden promotion to a prominent leadership role may have burdened him with many new responsibilities.“With Shubman, taking up the captaincy the way he did in England, seeing how well he led and how much pride he took in that performance, I think an element of that carried over into what he wanted to do in the T20I side. If anything, he was too caring and maybe a little bit too tight,” Doeschate said.“Towards the back end of the Australia tour, the talk was about freeing up a little bit more, try to relinquish that responsibility, certainly in that capacity where you feel like it’s all about you and you really need to justify your place in the team. We don’t want him to do that. We want him to play as freely as he does during IPL seasons,” he added.Just after the high of the T20 World Cup win in 2024, Indian cricket rushed towards an inevitable transition. Some tough calls were taken, especially in assigning leadership roles across formats.Both Gill and Surya were catapulted to the captaincy ahead of men in queue. As Doeschate said, it may have started to play on their minds, leading to constant anxiety to prove their worth as leaders.“About the leadership roles, we’re quite far down the road now with our planning and you know how we have set the team up,” Doeschate said. However, the team management, in its rush to prove its flexible approach, has often made whimsical moves, like Axar Patel’s promotion on Thursday night to No. 3, which meant two left handers were at the crease, which goes against most T20 match-up theories.“We’ve got eight games now before the World cup. Frankly, we found ourselves being 35/3 more times than we would have liked in the last couple of months. It’s just a exploration into how we can extend the batting,” Doeschate explained. But it also leaves one wondering if the team management has enough faith in proper batters to do the job at the top. Shielding the captain may not be the best idea.The Indian team management took harsh calls in 2024 hoping things would stabilise by the 2026 T20 World Cup. It’s just the men they put behind the wheels to steer the team out of choppy waters are in turmoil. With two months and eight games to go, the best the team management could do is define roles and bring stability.","Ryan ten Doeschate backs under-fire Suryakumar Yadav, Shubman Gill to regain form.

Fans expressed anger through vandalism, blaming poor event management and VIPs for monopolising Messi's time.""I think it's very unfortunate. I think the organisers did their best, but sometimes it gets out of control, especially VIP culture - it becomes very difficult even to the organisers to stop a lot of VIPs who are not supposed to be there as well, I think they entered and crowded.

So, I think that was where the fans were very upset,"" Bhaichung Bhutia told ANI.Bhutia emphasised Messi's massive following in Kolkata and across India, suggesting the need to prevent unwanted VIP presence at such events.""Hopefully, I think these kinds of mistakes don't happen...I heard 80,000 people came in to see Messi. Knowing that Messi is worshipped in Kolkata and in India, when they get disappointed paying such a high-price and coming from such faraway places, I think it's very disappointing.I think the Govt has taken some steps and action...My only suggestion is that I think in future this has to be really well-organised and at the same time, lot of unwanted VIPs surrounding should be avoided,"" Bhutia added.West Bengal Sports Minister Aroop Biswas announced a government investigation into the incident.Governor Ananda Bose confirmed the event organiser's arrest, stating, ""The organiser has been arrested, and an investigation has been done...""Additional Director General Law and Order Jawed Shamim assured that the situation was under control.""There is normalcy now.

Crowd surge derails programme



Prime organiser detained



NEW DELHI: Kolkata has a tradition of celebrating football icons. On Saturday afternoon, that expectation turned into anger as Lionel Messi ’s scheduled appearance ended amid disorder at the Salt Lake Stadium.The city’s long wait to see the Argentine star did not last long. Messi, who is in India as part of his GOAT Tour, was forced to end his lap of honour at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan after the crowd surged towards the field. Bottles were thrown from the stands, and security staff escorted him off the ground within minutes.What was meant to be a memorable day for football fans in the City of Joy turned into confusion, with “less of Messi” and more of what several spectators described as a “royal mess”, as order inside the stadium broke down.Many fans, including those who bought high-priced tickets, said they did not get to see Messi at all, either in person or on the giant screens, even after waiting for hours. A tight security setup and the presence of politicians and other dignitaries in key seating areas further limited visibility, adding to the anger among spectators.The World Cup-winning captain reached the stadium around 11.30 am along with long-time strike partner Luis Suárez and Argentina teammate Rodrigo De Paul.His vehicle was parked close to the touchline. When he stepped onto the ground, he was surrounded by VIPs, organisers, celebrities and security staff, leaving fans in the stands struggling to see him.Messi walked only a short distance on the field and waved briefly at the crowd as chants of ""Messi, Messi"" rang out across the stadium.Soon, spectators realised that the footballer remained enclosed by security and invited guests, making him difficult to see from many parts of the galleries. Several fans said even the giant screens did not show him clearly.Anger grew as it became clear that the Argentine star would not complete the planned lap of the stadium. Chants of ""We want Messi"" became louder.Messi then turned back midway and was taken off the field well before the scheduled end of his appearance.Once news spread that he had left early, tempers flared.Bottles were thrown from the stands onto the field, followed by plastic chairs. Sponsor banners and hoardings were pulled down, fibreglass seats were broken, and some spectators tried to tear down barricades to enter the ground.Repeated announcements over the public address system asking unauthorised people to leave the ground were largely ignored, as fans continued shouting slogans against the organisers and the state sports department.Within minutes, hundreds of spectators spilled onto the pitch, pulling down temporary tents and damaging equipment placed near the boundary.Police struggled to control the crowd, leading to the deployment of the Rapid Action Force (RAF) inside the stadium.Ticket prices ranged from Rs 4,500 to Rs 10,000, with many fans arriving early in the morning hoping to see the footballer closely.The disorder also led to the early end of the programme, leaving several invited guests, including Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, former India cricket captain Sourav Ganguly and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, unable to take part as planned.“Here, a glass of cold drink costs Rs 150–200, yet we couldn’t even catch a glimpse of Messi. People have spent a month’s salary to see him. I paid Rs 5,000 for the ticket and came with my son to watch Messi not politicians. The police and military personnel were taking selfies, and the management is to blame. There wasn’t even drinking water available,” an angry fan, Ajay Shah, told news agency PTI.Police on Saturday detained Satadru Datta, the main organiser of the Lionel Messi football event at the Salt Lake Stadium, after the chaos forced the World Cup-winning captain to leave the field early.Datta was detained over alleged mismanagement of the event from Kolkata airport, where he had gone to see off Messi and his entourage as they departed for Hyderabad.""We are looking into whether there was any mismanagement from the organiser's side, which led to the chaos at the stadium. He has been detained, and the police have now brought the situation under control,"" West Bengal DGP Rajeev Kumar said.Kumar added that the organiser had given a written assurance that ticket money would be refunded to spectators who were disappointed.Earlier in the day, actor Shah Rukh Khan met Lionel Messi in Kolkata during the GOAT India Tour 2025. Messi arrived in India with long-time strike partner Luis Suárez and Argentina teammate Rodrigo De Paul.Messi had earlier visited India in 2011, when he led the Argentina national team in a match against Venezuela at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata.","Messi forced to end lap of honour at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan after the crowd surged towards the field.

Gisele Bündchen and Joaquim Valente choose movement, family, and privacy

Gisele Bündchen and Joaquim Valente are spending the holidays nowhere near a fireplace, and that feels perfectly on brand for them. While much of the world leans into winter routines, the couple chose movement, sunlight, and open water near their Surfside, Florida home. Their recent jet ski outing was not staged or showy. It felt relaxed, intimate, and deeply familiar, like two people fully at ease with the life they are building together.The scene captured something quieter than celebrity spectacle. Life jackets secured, sunglasses on, they stayed close as they cut through calm blue water. Bündchen looked strong and confident, the result of years of discipline and the jiu jitsu training she has openly embraced alongside Valente. This was not a photo about fashion or fame. It was about rhythm, balance, and shared momentum at a time when their personal world has expanded in meaningful ways.For Bündchen and Valente, the jet skis were less about thrill and more about connection. Since welcoming their first child together in February, the couple has kept their family life intentionally private. Their son’s name and face remain out of the spotlight, a decision that reflects Bündchen’s growing focus on grounding moments over public noise.Time on the water fits that pattern. It offers space to breathe, reset, and simply be present.Bündchen’s comfort in the ocean is no surprise. Just days before, she wrapped up a demanding photoshoot that highlighted her athletic frame in a one piece swimsuit. Yet even then, the energy felt less performative and more reflective of who she is now. A woman who values strength, health, and freedom over spectacle. Jet skiing, something she has done for years, seems to mirror that mindset better than any posed shot ever could.Her past chapter with Tom Brady remains part of her story, especially as they share two children together. Brady, meanwhile, made news of his own this week by addressing speculation about a possible NFL return. Speaking with Colin Cowherd, the 48 year old was candid about why that door is closed.""I certainly could... I would say the answer for me would be yes,"" Brady answered. ""I'm not allowed to anymore, because I'm an owner, a minority owner of the Raiders. So I can't un-retire. But I'm very excited to watch Philip play.""Since becoming a limited partner of the Las Vegas Raiders in October 2024, league rules make a comeback impossible. That clarity mirrors what Bündchen appears to have found herself. Different paths, steady footing, and a life shaped more by intention than expectation.Also Read: Who is Fernando Mendoza?

Fernando Mendoza: The Heisman Trophy 2025 winner



Fernando Mendoza and the Heisman Trophy finally met on a stage that once felt unreachable for Indiana football. On a December night in New York City, the spotlight found a quarterback who reshaped expectations through precision, patience, and belief.This was not just a personal triumph. The journey was built on calm leadership, relentless preparation, and a refusal to be boxed in by recruiting labels. Indiana did not simply arrive. It announced itself. Here’s what you need to know the 2025 Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza.Fernando Mendoza was named the recipient of the 2025 Heisman Trophy on Dec. 13 during an awards ceremony in New York City, becoming the first player in Indiana history to win college football’s most prestigious individual honor. He earned 2,392 points from voters, including 643 first-place votes, and won by a commanding 957-point margin. The result reflected dominance, not debate.The numbers explain part of the story. Mendoza threw for 2,980 yards and a national-best 33 touchdown passes while leading Indiana to a perfect 13-0 season and a Big Ten championship. His command of the offense turned close games into statements and pressure moments into opportunities.Indiana also secured a first-round bye in the College Football Playoff, a reward that speaks to consistency as much as talent.The field of finalists underscored the scale of the achievement. Vanderbilt’s Diego Pavia, Ohio State’s Julian Sayin, and Notre Dame’s Jeremiyah Love all had seasons worthy of attention. Yet Mendoza separated himself through efficiency, decision-making, and poise. He had already collected the Associated Press Player of the Year honor, along with the Maxwell and Davey O’Brien awards, before stepping onto the Heisman stage.His path adds weight to the accomplishment. A redshirt junior and once lightly recruited prospect, Mendoza is only the second Heisman finalist in Indiana history, joining Anthony Thompson from 1989. This win also marked another program milestone, following last year’s top-10 finish by quarterback Kurtis Rourke. Momentum now feels real, not theoretical.Raised in Miami and shaped by early years in California football, Mendoza transferred to Indiana seeking growth rather than comfort. That decision paid off. Scouts point to his strong arm, sharp reads, and mobility, but teammates speak just as often about his calm presence. Draft boards already place him among the top prospects for 2026, yet his focus remains on what comes next with the Hoosiers.Mendoza closed his Heisman speech with words that captured the spirit of his rise.“I was you. I was that kid, too. I was in your shoes. The truth is, you don’t need the most stars, hype or rankings. You just need discipline, heart, and people who believe in you. ... I hope this moment shows you that chasing your dreams is worth it, no matter how big or impossible they might seem.”Also Read: ESPN influencer Katie Feeney steals the spotlight posing with the Heisman Trophy in eye-catching knee-high boots","Fernando Mendoza is the first player in Indiana history to win college football's most prestigious individual honor.

NFL Injury Report: 49ers’ game plan in limbo after Christian McCaffrey unexpectedly lands on injury report before Titans game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-injury-report-49ers-game-plan-in-limbo-after-christian-mccaffrey-unexpectedly-lands-on-injury-report-before-titans-game/articleshow/125956508.cms,"Christian McCaffrey injury update (Imagn Images)

Christian McCaffrey injury update brings cautious optimism



San Francisco’s week has carried a familiar tension. The practice field brought relief, then caution followed close behind. Christian McCaffrey moved freely on Friday, completing a full session that seemed to quiet worries about his recent illness. For a moment, it felt like business as usual for an offense that leans heavily on his presence. Yet with the 49ers, reassurance rarely lasts long when it comes to their most valuable weapon.By nightfall, a new layer of concern had emerged. McCaffrey’s name landed on the injury report with a questionable tag for Sunday’s home matchup against the Tennessee Titans. ESPN’s Adam Schefter cited a back issue, a development that instantly sharpened focus across the fan base. In a season shaped by setbacks, even minor uncertainty around the star running back carries weight.Details remain scarce, which is often what fuels anxiety most. Still, the early tone suggests this is not a situation spiraling toward long-term absence. Schefter reported McCaffrey is expected to be “good to go,” a phrase that offered a collective exhale inside the organization. The 49ers are fighting to hold their ground at 9-4, clinging to an NFC Wild Card spot despite weeks of attrition.Losing their offensive centerpiece now would threaten that fragile footing.San Francisco’s approach hints at restraint rather than panic. The coaching staff understands the stakes, but it also recognizes McCaffrey’s history. At 29, he has already endured four seasons in which injuries cost him more than half the schedule. That context shapes every decision. Playing through discomfort is part of football, especially in December, yet recklessness serves no one when January remains the goal.When healthy, McCaffrey changes the geometry of the field. His production tells that story clearly. He has piled up 1,655 scrimmage yards and found the end zone 13 times, acting as the steady pulse of an offense missing key contributors throughout the year. Defenses still key on him, even as his rushing average sits at 3.6 yards per carry. The attention he commands opens lanes and possibilities that statistics alone cannot capture.Sunday’s opponent adds another layer of opportunity. The Titans arrive at 2-11, struggling to contain versatile attacks. If McCaffrey suits up as expected, this game presents a chance to build momentum and perhaps nudge that rushing average upward. More importantly, it offers San Francisco a path to stability.For now, concern has softened into watchful patience. The message is clear. Breathe, but stay alert. With Christian McCaffrey, optimism and caution often walk side by side.Also Read: Christian McCaffrey injury update: Will the 49ers star push through illness to play Titans in Week 15?","San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey is questionable for Sunday's game against the Tennessee Titans.

Was a pizza named after Paige Shiver?

The ""Paige Shiver's Cauliflower Pizza,"" reportedly influenced by Moore, drew sharp criticism and online speculation, highlighting how off-field scandals can quickly impact public spaces and local traditions.

Sherrone Moore pizza controversy fuels questions about Paige Shiver menu item

The fallout from Sherrone Moore’s abrupt exit at Michigan has taken an unexpected and oddly public turn. As the former Wolverines head coach faces scrutiny over an alleged inappropriate relationship, a seemingly harmless college-town tradition has ignited fresh debate. A popular Ann Arbor eatery found itself pulled into the spotlight after fans noticed menu items bearing the names of both Moore and Paige Shiver, the staffer reportedly linked to the controversy.What might have once passed as a playful nod to campus personalities now reads very differently. In the charged atmosphere surrounding Moore’s firing, the viral menu discovery has fueled speculation, jokes, and sharp criticism online. It also highlights how quickly off-field drama can spill into public spaces, blurring the line between local culture and national scandal.The Brown Jug, a long-standing Ann Arbor bar near campus, briefly featured two items that caught social media’s attention. One was a Sherrone Moore Sampler Basket. The other, more controversial option, was a cauliflower gluten-free pizza named after Paige Shiver. While athlete-themed menu items are common in college towns, critics quickly noted that Shiver was not a public-facing sports figure.The controversy escalated after Michigan-based podcaster Justin Spirro alleged Moore played a role in arranging the pizza’s name. In a post that went viral, Spirro wrote, “I’m told Sherrone Moore helped arrange the naming of this menu item in honor of his mistress. As of now, you can still order Paige Shiver’s Cauliflower Pizza.”That claim has not been independently confirmed. Still, the optics were enough to trigger backlash. The New York Post also pointed out that Shiver’s pizza stood out as one of the few items not tied to a famous Michigan athlete or coach.Within hours, fans flooded social media with disbelief and sarcasm. One joked about a missed chance to rename it the “Paige Shiver Side Pizza.” Others noticed the item quietly disappearing from the menu, suggesting the restaurant moved quickly to limit further damage.For Michigan, the episode underscores a larger truth. In high-profile programs, even pizza menus are no longer safe from scandal.Also Read: What is Paige Shiver’s net worth?

Tom Brady can never actually play professionally in the NFL unless some things change

The Indianapolis Colts just brought 44-year-old Philip Rivers to their practice squad, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers re-signed 36-year-old veteran outside linebacker Jason Pierre-Paul. With older players returning to the foray this Super Bowl season, naturally, fans are curious to know if the GOAT Tom Brady can also possibly be back, considering his love of ‘unretiring.’However, it’s virtually impossible, thanks to an NFL rule. Recently, Tom Brady weighed in on whether he could still play at 48. Brady believes that, even at his age, he can still play football professionally.""Yes, I certainly could,"" Brady said when he spoke to FOX Sports. ""I think the answer for me would be yes. I’m not allowed to anymore because I’m a minority owner of the Raiders, so I can’t unretire.""Brady had retired from football in February 2022. He ended his run as a part of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers but announced his return 40 days later. He went on to play the entire 2022 season with Tampa Bay before finally retiring once again.Brady is not wrong at all! He currently holds a minority ownership stake in the Las Vegas Raiders, and under NFL rules, that makes his return impossible.League regulations do not allow active players to also be team owners, even if they are minority ones. It’s because ownership is viewed as a business or investment role, which clashes with being a player. Once Brady bought into the Raiders, he effectively made himself ineligible to play again. Unless Brady wanted to give up his stake in the Raiders, chances are he will have to be content on the sidelines.Tom Brady retired at 45 after the 2022 season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers who finished 8–9. It also closed the book on Brady’s 23rd and final NFL season. However, Brady’s stint as a broadcaster has been particularly well-received.Tom Brady became the lead analyst for Fox Sports' NFL coverage and works alongside Kevin Burkhardt.

49ers’ Christian McCaffrey added to injury report might not be expecting to play vs. Titans



The 49ers received a concerning update midweek as running back Christian McCaffrey was added to the team’s injury report due to a back issue. Listed as questionable for Sunday’s Week 15 matchup against the Tennessee Titans, the veteran star has already shaken off an illness this week but now faces uncertainty leading into the 4:25 p.m. ET kickoff.According to sources, McCaffrey’s back injury puts his availability in doubt, and the official game status will not be known until the 49ers release their inactive list roughly 90 minutes before kickoff. This comes after McCaffrey had already battled an illness during Week 15 preparations, making this the second health concern of the week.Should McCaffrey be sidelined, the 49ers’ backfield depth chart suggests that Brian Robinson would likely step in as the lead back. Supporting carries would come from Isaac Guerendo and Jordan James, but none of them offer the same versatility or playmaking ability that McCaffrey provides both in rushing and receiving situations. His potential absence could significantly affect San Francisco’s offensive scheme and limit quarterback Brock Purdy’s options.McCaffrey has been the 49ers’ most dynamic offensive weapon this season, leading the team in rushing and receiving production out of the backfield.His ability to contribute both on the ground and through the air makes him critical to San Francisco’s offensive success, and missing him could shift the Titans’ defensive game plan significantly.While Christian McCaffrey was added to the 49ers’ injury report and briefly listed as questionable, full practice on Friday confirmed he is ready to play against the Titans but this new twist now puts Christian McCaffrey’s status for Sunday’s game against the Titans uncertain, with the back injury adding to earlier illness concerns. The 49ers and their fans will wait until the official inactive list is announced shortly before kickoff, but if sidelined, San Francisco will rely heavily on Brian Robinson and the rest of the backfield to carry the offense.Also read - Trevon Diggs’ relationship with Cowboys hits breaking point as he’s sidelined since Week 6",Christian McCaffrey was added to the 49ers’ injury report and briefly listed as questionable for Sunday’s game against the Tennessee Titans.

Trevon Diggs sidelined, Cowboys standoff sparks debate among fans and NFL insiders



Dallas Cowboys fans have been left wondering about the status of cornerback Trevon Diggs as reports indicate that his relationship with the team has reportedly “soured” and may even be “severed. ” Diggs hasn’t played since Week 6 due to knee and concussion issues, and recent developments suggest tension between the star cornerback and the organization.Diggs entered the 2025 season as a cornerstone of the Cowboys’ secondary but was sidelined after Week 6 due to a combination of a knee injury and lingering concussion concerns. Despite progress in rehab and practicing with the team, he has not been activated to the 53-man roster. Before his absence, Diggs recorded 3 interceptions and 22 tackles, showcasing the impact he had on Dallas’ defense. His absence has left a noticeable void in the secondary, forcing the Cowboys to adjust their defensive schemes.According to an NFL insider, the relationship between Diggs and the Cowboys has “soured” and been “severed.” The tension reportedly stems from differences over playing status and team expectations, with Diggs feeling ready to return while the team has opted to keep him on injured reserve.The stalemate has left fans questioning whether this is a temporary holdout issue or a longer-term rift.Cowboys executives have stated that they hope Diggs can contribute this season, but coaches emphasize that he must meet all readiness standards before returning to the field. Analysts point out that this standoff could impact the team’s defensive performance, especially in upcoming games where the Cowboys face high-powered offenses. Sources suggest that while both sides are frustrated, there’s still a possibility for reconciliation if Diggs returns to full fitness and aligns with the team’s expectations.Diggs is under contract long-term, but the ongoing tension raises questions about his future with the team. If the standoff continues, the Cowboys may explore trade options or roster adjustments in the offseason. Historically, similar situations between star players and franchises have led to early exits or renegotiated contracts, adding to the uncertainty surrounding Diggs’ career trajectory.The Trevon Diggs saga is far from over. His absence, combined with reports of a fractured relationship with the Cowboys, has created uncertainty for both the team and its fans. As the season progresses, all eyes will be on whether Diggs can return to the field, repair ties with the organization, and help stabilize Dallas’ secondary.

New Orleans Pelicans upside:

New Orleans Pelicans risks:

The Los Angeles Lakers are off to a blistering 15-5 start in the 2025–26 season, and league insiders believe the front office is already hunting for a move that could turn a hot start into a full-blown title push. With Luka Dončić now the engine of the franchise and LeBron James still anchoring the win-now window, the Lakers are reportedly open to reshaping the edges of the roster.At the center of the latest trade chatter is Maxi Kleber, the 33-year-old big man acquired as part of the blockbuster February 2025 deal that sent Anthony Davis to Dallas. Once viewed as a useful connector, Kleber has increasingly been framed around the league as movable salary. Recent reports link the Lakers to a bold proposal involving the New Orleans Pelicans that would bring elite defender Herb Jones to Los Angeles in exchange for Kleber, rookie Dalton Knecht, and a 2031 first-round pick.Maxi Kleber arrived in Los Angeles largely as salary ballast in the Dončić-Anthony Davis megadeal, and his Lakers tenure has never fully taken off. Injuries have played a major role, with oblique and back issues limiting his availability and rhythm.Through nine appearances this season, he has been confined to short bench stints and has struggled to carve out a consistent role.His $11 million expiring contract, however, is precisely what makes him valuable now. For a team like New Orleans that may be pivoting toward a retool or partial reset, Kleber represents clean, flexible money that can either be flipped again or allowed to expire without long-term risk.The rumored structure is straightforward and cap-savvy, built around balancing present value with future upside.• Herb Jones• Maxi Kleber• Dalton Knecht• 2031 first-round pick (lottery protected)Jones is in the first season of a three-year, $68 million extension, carrying a $22.7 million annual cap hit. Kleber’s expiring deal helps bridge the salary gap, while Knecht and the distant first-rounder add youth and future value. From the Lakers’ side, the outgoing package trims about $1.1 million in salary, keeping future flexibility intact.Herb Jones has built a reputation as one of the league’s most disruptive wing defenders, earning All-Defense recognition and routinely drawing the toughest perimeter assignments. For a Lakers team built around Dončić’s offensive brilliance and LeBron’s all-around control, Jones would slide in as a natural complement.He would immediately upgrade Los Angeles’ wing defense, allowing JJ Redick to deploy more aggressive schemes without overtaxing Dončić or James. Jones does not need the ball to impact games, thrives in transition, and consistently creates extra possessions with deflections, steals, and blocks.On a struggling Pelicans team hovering below .500, Jones’ value may never be higher. In Los Angeles, his skill set would be amplified by a clear role and postseason stakes.For the Pelicans, this deal leans into long-term thinking rather than short-term wins.• Dalton Knecht brings instant scoring juice and shooting upside, with lottery pedigree and the ability to grow into a larger offensive role.• Maxi Kleber offers veteran frontcourt minutes or a clean contract that can be rerouted.• The 2031 first-round pick gives New Orleans a valuable future asset at a time when the Lakers’ long-term outlook is impossible to predict.The biggest cost is obvious: moving on from arguably the team’s best perimeter defender. But if the Pelicans are serious about resetting their timeline, this package supplies flexibility, youth, and draft capital.Jones’ raw numbers undersell his impact. Game logs frequently show spikes of four or more combined steals and blocks, reinforcing his reputation as a defensive tone-setter rather than a box-score star.• Immediate defensive upgrade on the wing• Cleaner playoff rotations around Dončić and LeBron• Converts Kleber’s stalled role into a high-impact piece• Giving up Dalton Knecht’s scoring potential• Surrendering a valuable long-term first-round pick• Youth, shooting, and draft capital to fuel a reset• Financial flexibility with Kleber’s expiring deal• Losing a rare, elite wing defender who is difficult to replaceFrom a purely competitive standpoint, the Lakers come out ahead. Adding Herb Jones would push an already dangerous 15–5 team closer to true juggernaut status, particularly in the Western Conference playoff grind. His ability to erase perimeter threats while Luka Dončić orchestrates the offense is a clean, logical upgrade.For New Orleans, the move signals a willingness to prioritize future assets over clinging to a stalled core. It may hurt in the short term, but the return aligns with a longer-range vision.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Miami Heat could sign $186 million Milwaukee Bucks in a bold Bucks trade; Tyler Herro key trade asset?

San Antonio Spurs Injury Report vs the Oklahoma City Thunder (December 13, 2025)

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is set to take the floor for the Oklahoma City Thunder in their NBA Cup semifinal showdown against the San Antonio Spurs on December 13, 2025, with his name absent from the latest injury report. After a brief, precautionary absence earlier this month, the reigning MVP has quickly reasserted himself as one of the league’s most unstoppable forces, putting Thunder fans firmly at ease ahead of this high-pressure matchup in Las Vegas.The timing could not be better for Oklahoma City. With a spot in the NBA Cup final on the line, the Thunder enter the semifinals healthy, confident, and firing on all cylinders. Gilgeous-Alexander’s return to peak form has coincided with OKC’s dominance, reinforcing their status as the West’s top seed and a legitimate favorite to lift another trophy.Saturday’s clash tips off at 8 p.m. CT and features two teams trending upward. Oklahoma City Thunder arrive fresh off a staggering 138-89 blowout win over the Phoenix Suns, a game so lopsided that Shai Gilgeous-Alexander never touched the floor in the fourth quarter.

Since returning, he has posted dominant performances, including a recent 35-point, nine-rebound outing that underscored his rhythm and confidence.No current reports list him as questionable or limited for the Spurs matchup. Averaging 32.6 points per game on an elite 56.2 percent shooting clip, SGA is enjoying the most efficient season of his career. Oklahoma City has been proactive with load management, often resting him during blowouts rather than due to injury concerns.Oklahoma City enters the semifinal with its core rotation healthy and available.Cason Wallace is listed as questionable with an undisclosed issue, but the expected starting lineup, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Chet Holmgren, and Jalen Williams, remains intact.San Antonio Spurs counter with optimism of its own, as Victor Wembanyama is listed as probable after working his way back from a month-long calf strain. His availability sets the stage for a marquee SGA vs. Wembanyama duel.

A former national-level tennis player, Radhika Yadav , was shot dead by her father Deepak Yadav in Gurugram on July 10. The accused confessed to killing his daughter because he was mocked by villagers for living off her earnings from her tennis academy, which hurt his dignity.The incident occurred around 10:30 am when Radhika's uncle Kuldeep heard a loud bang from the first floor of their house. Upon investigation, he found Radhika lying in the kitchen and a revolver in the drawing room. Kuldeep and his son Piyush rushed Radhika to Asia Moringo Hospital in Sector 56, Gurugram, where doctors declared her dead.During interrogation, Deepak admitted that Radhika was a successful tennis player who had competed at the national level. She had recently opened her academy to coach children after suffering a shoulder injury.""When I used to go to Wazirabad village to get milk, people used to taunt me, saying that I live off my daughter's earnings. This troubled me a lot. Some people even questioned my daughter's character. I told my daughter to close her tennis academy, but she refused. This situation kept bothering me as it hurt my dignity. I was very troubled and stressed.Because of this tension, I took out my licensed revolver, and when my daughter Radhika was cooking in the kitchen, I shot her three times from behind, hitting her waist. I have killed my daughter,"" Deepak confessed.Manju Yadav, Radhika's mother, declined to provide a written statement but verbally informed police that she was in her room with fever during the incident. She expressed confusion about her husband's actions, stating that Radhika had good character.India's tennis professionals Sowjanya Bavisetti and Sharmada Balu shared their reactions to the tragic incident.""This is heart wrenching. I only met her once at a tournament. She had the prettiest smile. I can't believe her own father could think of committing such a heinous crime. A whole life ahead of her has been taken away because of a stupid 'log kya kehenge' [what would people say]. Rest in peace, girl! May you get a better family in next life,"" wrote Bavisetti on Instagram.Balu, a former national champion, wrote, ""This is so heartbreaking and disturbing,"" on Instagram.Describing the incident, Kuldeep said, ""Today, I was at my house when around 10:30 am I suddenly heard a loud bang. Hearing the noise, I went to the first floor where my brother lives and upon entering the house, I saw my niece, Radhika Yadav, lying in the kitchen and a revolver lying in the drawing room.""""After that, my son Piyush Yadav and I went upstairs. We both lifted Radhika and took her in our car to the Asia Moringo Hospital, Sector 56, Gurugram, for treatment. After examination, the doctor declared my niece dead,"" he added.Kuldeep confirmed that only Deepak, his wife Manju Yadav, and Radhika were present at the time of the incident. The murder weapon was identified as Deepak's licensed 32-bore revolver.Police investigators collected fingerprints from the revolver and found five cartridges, one of which was live. They secured the revolver, live cartridge, blood samples, and swabs as evidence.The police have established that the accused has committed offences under sections 103(1) and 27(3) of the relevant law based on statements, crime scene inspection, physical evidence, and the accused's confession.""My niece had been shot. Radhika was a prominent tennis player who had won many trophies. I am shocked by her death and cannot understand why she was murdered. When I went to the first floor, only my brother Deepak, my sister-in-law Manju Yadav, and the deceased Radhika were present. My nephew Dheeraj Yadav was not there at the time; only these three were upstairs. The revolver found there was a licensed 32-bore revolver belonging to my brother Deepak,"" Kuldeep stated.","Former national-level tennis player, Radhika Yadav, was shot dead by her father Deepak Yadav in Gurugram on July 10.

Australian fast bowler Mitchell Starc is set to reach a significant milestone as he prepares to play his 100th Test match against West Indies in Kingston on Sunday, becoming only the second Australian pace bowler after Glenn McGrath to achieve this feat. Starc's journey to this milestone has been marked by his resilience through injuries and his commitment to managing his workload, including choosing to skip IPL opportunities.In his 99 Tests so far, he has claimed 395 wickets, including 15 five-wicket hauls and 20 four-wicket hauls, often turning games with devastating spells.The left-arm fast bowler has established himself as a crucial member of the Australian bowling attack, forming a formidable partnership with Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood . His achievements include winning two 50-over World Cups and being part of the Australian squad that secured the World Test Championship in 2023.""I've looked after or tried to look after my body and be able to find ways through pain barriers to make an impact for the team,"" Starc told cricket.com.au. ""I've been a player that's been injured and left them a man down before, and I never wanted to do that again. So to find ways when things weren't going well, or things were sore, or if I was carrying something, to still be able to push through and finish games and still be impactful, was part of it.But I've also had a lot of help along the way, with trainers and physios and my best mates being teammates, all helped me to keep playing and wanting to compete and still be a part of the group.""Starting his cricket journey as a wicketkeeper in age-group cricket, Starc's transformation into one of Australia's premier fast bowlers has been remarkable. His dedication to the game and ability to maintain his performance levels despite physical challenges has been a defining aspect of his career.""I didn't think I'd play one (Test),"" said Starc. ""(It's) pretty humbling to play that much. A huge honour, probably something more to reflect on when I'm finished.

What Sachin Tendulkar said on not having a century at Lord's

Enhanced security measures have been enforced at Lord's Cricket Ground for the third Test between England and India, which began on Thursday. The protocols include random spot checks on spectators and the deployment of undercover personnel, following disruptions during the previous Ashes series and concerns about potential protests at this marquee clash.The match is expected to draw the biggest crowd at Lord’s since the 2023 Ashes, with tickets sold out for the first four days and approximately 16,000 already purchased for Day 5.As part of the tightened security, flags and banners are prohibited, and additional safeguards have been introduced for players in the pavilion. These steps follow incidents of verbal abuse targeted at Australian players during last year’s Ashes Test.One of the most alarming breaches came during the second Ashes Test in 2023, when a Just Stop Oil protester ran onto the field and threw orange paint on the pitch. The protester was swiftly removed by England wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow.On the field, Joe Root’s unbeaten 99 anchored England’s innings on a slow, grinding first day at Lord’s. The hosts ended Thursday on 251 for 4 after opting to bat first.Root walked in with England in trouble at 44 for 2, after India’s Nitish Kumar Reddy made a sensational start by removing both openers—Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley—in his very first over.In a departure from England’s usual ‘Bazball’ approach, Root curbed his aggression and led the resistance with a measured knock in his 156th Test appearance, scoring at a run rate just above three an over.Captain Ben Stokes, who won the toss under sunny skies at Lord’s, was unbeaten on 39 at stumps. He and Root have so far added an unbroken 79-run stand for the fifth wicket, giving England a foothold after early damage.","England and India begin third Test at Lord's on Thursday.

EXCLUSIVE: Shubman Gill-led Team India had a fun evening in London

India all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy, who impressed with a spirited spell on Day 1 of the third Test at Lord’s, said he was satisfied with his performance and remained hopeful about vice-captain Rishabh Pant’s fitness after the wicketkeeper suffered a blow to his finger.England, opting to bat for just the second time in the Bazball era, finished at 251 for 4 at stumps, with Joe Root unbeaten on 99 off 191 deliveries and Ben Stokes on 39*. The duo has added 79 runs so far for the unbroken fifth wicket, navigating a slow, testing pitch with a more traditional approach than England’s typical aggressive style.Reddy, who returned figures of 2 for 46 in 14 probing overs, dismissed both openers - Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley - in the morning session to give India an early edge.Speaking after the day’s play, Nitish said: ""Very happy with the way I bowled. Coming back from injury - it was not easy, I felt pain in the body because it was a side strain. But I am bowling well now. I am happy with the way I am bowling. I am doing what the team is asking me to do.""He credited Jasprit Bumrah’s leadership at the heart of India’s bowling plans: ""Just with [Jasprit] Bumrah leading the attack, we just follow what Bumrah says.""Reddy, when asked about potentially joining the prestigious Lord’s Honours Board with a five-wicket haul, said: ""I am not thinking about those things, but any player would like to be there.""Rishabh Pant, meanwhile, left the field during the second session after injuring his left index finger while attempting to stop a leg-side delivery. Dhruv Jurel replaced him behind the stumps.Providing an update, Reddy said: ""Don't have an update on Rishabh Pant yet. It is understood that team management will get clarity on Day 2 morning.""The BCCI earlier confirmed Pant is under medical supervision, stating: ""Team India vice-captain Rishabh Pant got hit on his left index finger. He is receiving treatment and under the supervision of the medical team.

Mulder eventually declared with his score on 367*, falling just 33 runs short of Lara’s iconic 400 not out, achieved against England in 2004.The conversation between Mulder and Lara took place after South Africa's victory in Bulawayo, where Mulder recorded the fifth-highest individual score in Test history.""I've chatted a little bit to Brian Lara. He said to me I'm creating my own legacy and I should have gone for it. He said records are there to be broken and he wishes if I'm ever in that position again I go and score more than what he had,"" Mulder told SuperSport.Mulder’s innings powered South Africa to a massive 626/5 and now stands as both the highest individual score by a South African and the best by any batter in an away Test match.Captaining the side for the first time in the absence of regular leaders Temba Bavuma and Keshav Maharaj, Mulder made the call to declare after discussions with head coach Shukri Conrad.""Brian Lara keeping that record is exactly the way it should be,"" Mulder said at the time of the declaration.Despite Lara’s encouragement, Mulder stood by his decision.""It's super special and not something I would have dreamt of. That was an interesting point of view from his side, but I still believe I did the right thing and respecting the game is the most important part for me.""Lara famously set the record for the highest individual Test score twice—first scoring 375 against England in 1994, which was later surpassed by Australia’s Matthew Hayden (380 against Zimbabwe in 2003), before reclaiming it with his unbeaten 400 a year later.The fourth-highest Test score belongs to Sri Lanka’s Mahela Jayawardene, who made 374 against South Africa in 2006.Mulder’s triple century was only the second in South African history, after Hashim Amla’s unbeaten 311 against England at The Oval in 2012.

The third Test between India and England at Lord’s has already delivered plenty of action on Day 1, with a mix of sharp bowling, injury concerns and on-field banter adding to the drama. India’s Nitish Kumar Reddy struck early to stun the English top order, removing Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett in the same over. The double blow slowed down England’s scoring rate and shifted the momentum towards the visitors.However, while the game on Thursday avoided any rain delays, an unexpected interruption brought play to a brief halt — a swarm of ladybugs invaded the pitch.India pacer Jasprit Bumrah appeared visibly irritated as the flying insects hovered around him, forcing a pause in play. The umpires came together for a discussion as England captain Ben Stokes was seen speaking to the umpire as well. Stokes looked perplexed by the unusual delay and seemed visibly uncomfortable.Commentators speculated about the type of insect before cameras revealed that ladybugs were behind the interruption. Adding to England's concerns, Stokes called for the physio, appearing to struggle with a groin issue, and received medical attention.After a few minutes, play resumed. By then, India had already picked up four wickets, and Joe Root was moving steadily towards what could be his 37th Test century. Despite the unusual break in play, the Test remains finely balanced heading into the final session of Day 1.At stumps on Day 1, England were 251/4 from 83 overs. Joe Root ended the day on 99* runs, while his partner at the crease and England skipper Ben Stokes added 39 from 102 balls on a day where 'Bazball' was muted.","The third Test between India and England at Lord's has already delivered plenty of action on Day 1, with a mix of sharp bowling, injury concerns and on-field banter.

Poll What do you think about India's bowling performance on Day 1 of the 3rd Test? Outstanding discipline Decent but could improve Struggled significantly Unfair to judge yet

What Sachin Tendulkar said on not having a century at Lord's

Brief Scores:

England:

You knew India were in their heads when Ben Stokes won the toss and elected to bat for the third Test at Lord's. It's something which has rarely happened in the Bazball era and something which was a shift from the side's template of ""we will chase anything"" template. They persisted with it in the first two games of the series but were challenged in Leeds and outplayed in Birmingham, and were left with no option but to move to Plan B. And B was anything but Bazball.Shubman Gill & Co. forced the hosts to hit snooze on the original B word and made them work hard for every run in front of the capacity crowd at the Home of Cricket. It was unusual, even for the thousands braving the harsh sun, and the tricky surface further helped India maintain that firm stranglehold over the day's play.The more the pitch baked under the sun, the more it became two paced. The odd one was keeping lower than usual and Ravindra Jadeja got some grip from the surface in the final session of day's play. It was another sub-continentish strip but with the ball not coming nicely on to the bat, run-scoring was hard work and disciplined bowling didn't allow the hosts to cut loose. Rubbing more salt to their approach, the Indian camp was very chirpy and the sledges of ""welcome to boring Test cricket"", ""Bazball, come on I want to see"" were heard loud and clear on the stump mic.Scoring rate remained just a shade over 3 for majority of the day and England's 70/0 in 24 overs bowled during the post Lunch session was their slowest session in the last three years. Even when they weren't picking wickets, India bowlers continued to keep the stumps in play and very sharp field placements didn't allow the opposition to dominate with a free-flowing approach.Except Akash Deep, who clearly struggled to adjust to the slope and never found the ideal rhythm, every Indian bowler maintained control and there were no freebies on offer. The questions were constantly asked with their discipline in lines and lengths and it was not Bumrah, not Siraj, not Akash Deep but Nitish Kumar Reddy who made an instant impact when he scalped both England openers in the same over. While he was lucky to get Ben Duckett with that long hop on the leg-side, the same can't be said for Zak Crawley, and the rest of his spell.The first Test at Lord's wasn't a problem for the youngster as he looked in no trouble with the slope and in fact used it to his advantage. Under the sun, Nitish's reduced pace (compared to other Indian bowlers) allowed more air time to the ball which was following a nice curve from the hand to the wicketkeeper's gloves. Credit to them, the hosts recovered well with Ollie Pope and Joe Root stand post Lunch as they didn't lose a wicket in the afternoon session.The runs weren't coming at Bazball pace but they weren't losing wickets. India toiled hard, very hard but picking wickets was hard work as nothing was happening off the pitch or in the air for the quicks. The ball, even without crashing into the digital boards behind the boundary ropes, had softened up a bit and a little bit of magic was the need of the hour in the last session.Ravindra Jadeja with the ball, first ball after Tea and India finally tasted success as the left-armer found Pope's edge to break the frustrating stand. The success lifted India's spirits after what had been a very tiring day and it was then over to that man Bumrah again to wake the crowd up when he went through Harry Brook's defence to pick another England wicket. From 2/152, the hosts were reduced to 4/172 and no madness with the bat meant the run-rate was always under check.It will not be fair to comment on pitch without seeing how both teams bat in their first essay but most of the day's play suggested batting will be hard work and reiterated that bowlers can't afford to miss their mark. Joe Root put on an exhibition with the bat as he operated with a lot of patience, discipline and composure to grind out a terrific unbeaten hand. There was nothing silly on display from the classy right-hander who stamped his class even when the odd one turned sharply, some kept low and batting overall wasn't the breeze we saw in the first two fixtures.England needed their experienced pro to dig deep in these conditions and he did just that with a masterful hundred. A repair job with Pope and then a solid stand with Ben Stokes meant the hosts ended the day in a position they wouldn't complain about. Pitch aside, India would consider the first day as a moral victory because a young and inexperienced unit forced the Bazballers to explore different ways of scoring, and surviving in the middle. And for a change, it wasn't hitting your way out of trouble.251 for 4 in 83 overs at stumps on Day 1 (Joe Root batting 99, Ben Stokes batting 39, Ollie Pope 44; Nitish Kumar Reddy 2/46).",Jasprit Bumrah and Nitish Kumar Reddy take two wickets in same over.

NEW DELHI: India allrounder Ravindra Jadeja appeared to remember every moment of the dominant 336-run win at Edgbaston, including a missed opportunity off his bowling when KL Rahul dropped a catch. On Day 5 of the second Test, England needed an improbable 536 runs to win, but India’s bowlers gave them no breathing room. However, with just two wickets remaining, Jadeja was denied the scalp of Brydon Carse due to Rahul's lapse in the slip cordon.The incident occurred on the third ball of the 57th over when Jadeja bowled a delivery that sharply spun from outside leg stump. Carse edged the ball thickly, but Rahul—fielding at first slip—couldn’t hold on to the chance. Replays revealed that Rahul was still adjusting the field and wasn’t ready when the ball came his way.On the opening day of the third Test at Lord’s, Jadeja cheekily reminded Rahul to stay alert.While bowling, he was caught on the stump mic saying:""KL dekh le fir bolega dhyaan nahi tha"" (“KL, watch it now or else later you'll say you weren’t paying attention.”)At stumps on Day 1, England were 251 for 4, with Joe Root unbeaten on 99 and Ben Stokes on 39.

What Sachin Tendulkar said on not having a century at Lord's

NEW DELHI: A cricketer from Suffolk has etched his name into the record books by claiming two hat-tricks in back-to-back overs. Kishor Kumar Sadhak, a spin bowler representing Ipswich and Colchester Cricket Club, pulled off this extraordinary feat during a match in the Two Counties Championship Division Six.Reflecting on the final wicket of his six-wicket haul, the 37-year-old told BBC Essex: ""When I saw that the person was bowled out, I was flying in the sky. It was amazing.""Sadhak wrapped up with impressive figures of 6 for 21 in his side’s victory over Kesgrave.Securing two hat-tricks in a single match is extremely rare in cricket. Mitchell Starc achieved it in 2017 while playing a Sheffield Shield game for New South Wales. Another notable instance dates back 113 years at Old Trafford, where Australia's Jimmy Matthews picked up two hat-tricks against South Africa — though both previous instances were split across two innings.Sadhak, who hails from Ipswich, shared that the team was in a jubilant mood after his memorable performance.""After the match I got plenty of phone calls,"" he said. ""We went to a restaurant and we enjoyed drinks and food. We spent almost two and a half hours there. It was a very lovely moment.""Out of his six wickets, five batters were clean bowled and one caught, with five players getting out for zero in IpsCol’s seven-wicket win.As for whether his spot in the team is now guaranteed, Sadhak remains modest.""There are lots of other players who play really well. So, I wouldn't say I'm the first person on the teamsheet but I will be in a priority position!""",Kishor Kumar Sadhak claims two hat-tricks in back-to-back overs.

As England and India battled on Day 1 of the Lord's Test, a key moment unfolded when India’s wicketkeeper-batter and vice-captain Rishabh Pant injured his finger while behind the stumps. The 27-year-old, who has been in fine form with the bat in the series, received medical attention after chipping his finger.Although it was later confirmed there was no major concern, Pant was replaced by Dhruv Jurel behind the stumps.Jurel was called into action immediately after tea, when Ravindra Jadeja dismissed Ollie Pope with a sharp delivery that was safely caught by the substitute keeper. Former India batter and wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik broke down the dismissal and pointed out a key technical difference between Pant and Jurel.“Dhruv Jurel's a lot more lower and closer to the keeping pads, and the height of it as compared to Rishabh Pant,” Karthik noted. He also highlighted the foot positioning: “The position of the right leg determines in many ways how well your head position is in relation with the glove.” According to him, Pant’s right foot is much closer to his body, while Jurel plants his foot well outside off stump, giving him better balance.The analysis, shared on Sky Sports Cricket’s X handle, showed Pant losing his footing on a similar delivery, while Jurel maintained balance and completed the catch with ease.While Pant played a role in both early dismissals of England’s openers, he has also missed multiple chances in the series, with a few notable drops in the first and second Tests.",Rishabh Pant injured his finger while behind the stumps on Day 1.

Legendary Indian batter Sunil Gavaskar has drawn a unique parallel between Rishabh Pant and Spanish tennis star Carlos Alcaraz, comparing the two for bringing unpredictability and excitement to their respective sports. While visiting the All England Lawn Tennis Club during the ongoing Wimbledon Championships , Gavaskar noted striking similarities between the two athletes.“Alcaraz is moving around so well, and he’s got all the shots in the book. He can be a bit of a showman sometimes, trying those drop shots when you think he should be finishing the point,"" Gavaskar told Star Sports.""But that’s what people come to watch, it’s like watching Rishabh Pant. With Pant, you have to expect the unexpected. Similarly, with Alcaraz, you have got to expect the unexpected. That’s what makes him so exciting,” he added.With Wimbledon coinciding with India's five-Test series in England, several former and current cricketers have been spotted enjoying tennis at the iconic venue.Gavaskar also revealed he prefers attending Wimbledon over visiting Lord’s—unless India are playing at the historic cricket ground.“Every time I am in England around this time, I go to Wimbledon, but I hardly go to Lord’s if India isn’t playing there. So yes, one could say that I come here more often than I go to Lord’s,"" he told Indian tennis legend Vijay Amritraj.Speaking about his pick for the title, Gavaskar added, “I would like Djokovic to win because it would be his 25th Grand Slam title. Nobody has ever won 25 majors, so that would be fantastic. My heart says Djokovic, but I guess my mind says Alcaraz.""Recently-retired Indian cricket icon Virat Kohli also expressed his admiration for Novak Djokovic and hoped to see him win the Wimbledon crown.""We have exchanged notes and he has been gracious and kind to stay in touch,"" Kohli said about Djokovic.""So, I'd say I want Novak and Carlos to be in the final, and ideally for Novak to win this one, because that would be a tremendous achievement for him at this stage of his career.""In the conversation about being the greatest of all time, he'd be right up there with anyone else, if not number one, with the maximum number of Grand Slam titles.

India’s vice-captain Rishabh Pant was forced to leave the field during the third Test against England at Lord’s on Thursday after sustaining a finger injury while keeping wickets. The injury occurred in the second session when a delivery from Jasprit Bumrah struck Pant’s left hand, prompting his replacement by substitute wicketkeeper Dhruv Jurel.The incident took place in the 34th over as Pant dived to stop a Bumrah delivery bowled down the leg side to Ollie Pope.Pant grimaced in pain while receiving treatment from physio Kamlesh Jain and had his fingers heavily taped. Though he remained on the field for the remainder of the over, Pant left for further medical attention immediately afterward.Jurel has previously kept wickets in three Tests against England during the 2024 home series and in India A’s matches against England Lions prior to the current five-match series.He also deputised for Pant when the latter sustained a knee injury during the Test against New Zealand in Bengaluru in October 2024.Later, footage showed head coach Gautam Gambhir and batting coach Sitanshu Kotak rising from their seats in the dressing room balcony to check on Pant as he was escorted inside by Jain.So far on this tour, Pant has scored 342 runs in two matches at an average of 85.50, including two centuries in the series opener at Headingley.Also See: Ind vs Eng Live Score","India's vice-captain Rishabh Pant forced to leave the field during the third Test against England at Lord's on Thursday.

Poll How do you view the criticism Henderson received for joining Al-Ettifaq? Justified, he prioritized money. Unjustified, players have to earn a living.

Jordan Henderson will leave Dutch club Ajax a year before his contract ends, the club announced on Thursday. The 35-year-old joined Ajax in January 2024, just six months after his move from Liverpool to Saudi club Al-Ettifaq, which drew criticism over gay rights concerns.An outspoken advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, Henderson was accused of prioritising money over principles. However, he soon turned the page on the controversy as Ajax named him club captain. He went on to make 57 appearances for the Amsterdam-based side, whose shirt has been worn by legends like Johan Cruyff and Dennis Bergkamp.Henderson played a pivotal role in Ajax’s revival following one of their worst seasons. Under his leadership, the team mounted a serious Eredivisie title challenge. However, despite holding a nine-point lead with five games remaining, Ajax surrendered the advantage and lost the title to rivals PSV Eindhoven.Ajax Technical Director Alex Kroes praised the veteran midfielder, saying, “Jordan was a true captain for us, both on and off the pitch. Through his mentality and leadership qualities, he made a significant contribution to our qualification for the UEFA Champions League.”Henderson’s performances also earned him a surprise recall to Thomas Tuchel’s first England squad in March. Reflecting on his stint in Amsterdam, Henderson said, “To play for this club was an honour in itself. To have the privilege of captaining it was even more so.”He added that he would not be making further comments due to the “tragic events of last week, and the devastating loss of my former teammate Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva,” as quoted by AFP.","Jordan Henderson will leave Dutch club Ajax in January 2024.

WATCH:

Real Madrid held off a late Borussia Dortmund surge to clinch a 3-2 win and book their place in the semi-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup, where they will face European champions Paris Saint-Germain. The match, played under sweltering heat at the MetLife Stadium near New York City, saw Gonzalo Garcia and Kylian Mbappe steal the show for the Spanish giants.Gonzalo Garcia, 21, opened the scoring in the 10th minute, slotting home his fourth goal of the tournament after an inch-perfect cross from Arda Guler. Ten minutes later, full-back Fran Garcia doubled the lead, finishing off a flowing move that included a cutback from Trent Alexander-Arnold. Real Madrid dominated the opening stages, stifling Dortmund’s rhythm and forcing them to chase shadows.Coach Xabi Alonso praised his team’s display but acknowledged the chaotic finish: “Everything was going under control… but the last 10 minutes were kind of crazy. Overall, a good 80 minutes and the last 10 minutes to improve.”Indeed, Dortmund mounted a dramatic late comeback.Maximilian Beier fired in from a loose clearance in the 93rd minute to make it 2-1. But Real’s response was emphatic — Mbappe, who came off the bench in the second half, produced a sensational overhead kick to restore the two-goal cushion.Mbappe, still yet to start in the tournament due to recent illness, now has his first goal of the Club World Cup and 44th of the season. ""It will be a great challenge for us to face PSG, but let's take positives from today and move on for the next one,"" said Alonso ahead of the semi-final showdown.There was still more drama to come, as Dean Huijsen was sent off for bringing down Serhou Guirassy, who converted the resulting penalty to bring Dortmund back within a goal.Despite the scare, Real held on, much to the delight of the 76,611 fans in attendance — a repeat of the 2024 Champions League final, but with far more twists.Dortmund coach Niko Kovac reflected, “It is a deserved win for Real Madrid. We showed our qualities and it is not a failure if you go home after a defeat against them.”","Real Madrid beat Borussia Dortmund 3-2 to reach the FIFA Club World Cup semi- finals.

Work and commitment

A late own-goal by goalkeeper Weverton took Chelsea through to the Club World Cup semi-finals on Friday as the Premier League side edged Palmeiras of Brazil 2-1 in a last-eight tie that had been lit up by a moment of magic from young star Estevao Willian.The teenage Brazil forward, who will join Chelsea after the tournament, was eager to impress his future employers and his brilliant 53rd-minute finish cancelled out Cole Palmer's opener in Philadelphia.But a deflected Malo Gusto cross went in off Palmeiras 'keeper Weverton in the 83rd minute to take Chelsea through to a semi-final showdown with another Brazilian side in Fluminense.""In the first half we were in control of the game and could have scored more than one goal,"" said Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca, dismissing suggestions his team had been fortunate.""They started the second half better than us and the dynamic of the game changed, but then in the last 25 minutes we were in control again and I think we deserved to win without being lucky.""The scoreline was a repeat of Chelsea's victory when the teams met in the final of the Club World Cup under the tournament's old guise in 2022.""Overall Chelsea was better. They have better players and a better coach,"" admitted Palmeiras coach Abel Ferreira.""They were lucky with the way they scored the second goal but it can happen in football and we need to accept it and move on.""Chelsea will now be fancied to go on and reach the final, with Fluminense standing in their way in the last four at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Tuesday.If not everyone has yet been won over by the tournament, the intensity levels on the pitch are rising as it reaches the business end and there was a big-game atmosphere in Philadelphia.Lincoln Financial Field was almost sold out, with 65,782 fans in attendance despite much of the city having emptied out for the July 4 holiday and long weekend.This game played out to a backdrop of Independence Day fireworks lighting up the sky over the nearby Delaware River, but there were fireworks on the pitch too.Chelsea lit the spark first, going ahead in the 16th minute thanks to a moment of class from England international Palmer.After drifting into a pocket of space just outside the Palmeiras box, Palmer controlled a Trevoh Chalobah pass on the half-turn, carried on into the area and dispatched a low shot past Weverton.It was the ideal start for Chelsea, who lost to Flamengo when they last faced Brazilian opposition in the same stadium during the group stage.Maresca added extra Brazilian flavour to the occasion by handing a first start to young midfielder Andrey Santos.With Moises Caicedo suspended, Santos occupied the holding midfield role for Chelsea while Pedro Neto lined up on the right wing, choosing to play despite having to come to terms with the tragic death of his Portugal teammate Diogo Jota on Thursday.Playing on the right wing for Palmeiras was Estevao, the 18-year-old Brazil prodigy set to join Chelsea in a big-money transfer agreed over a year ago.He knew this could be his last game for the Sao Paulo side, and Chelsea probably should have been two ahead before the interval only for Christopher Nkunku to blaze over after being teed up by Palmer.Instead Palmeiras equalised eight minutes into the second half, with Estevao the inevitable scorer.Positioned inside the Chelsea box to the right, Estevao controlled a pass by Richard Rios and took a touch to get in front of Levi Colwill, another to steady himself, and then surprised goalkeeper Robert Sanchez with an early shot that went in off the bar.Chelsea responded by sending on new signing Joao Pedro for his debut, the Brazilian becoming the 27th player used by Maresca during the tournament.The Blues pushed in search of a second goal but extra time was looking likely when the Premier League side grabbed a scrappy winner with seven minutes of the 90 to play.Following a corner played short, Enzo Fernandez found Malo Gusto and his attempted low centre from the left side of the box deflected off the toe of Agustin Giay to surprise Weverton, with the ball striking him on its way in.Substitute Hercules struck a 70th-minute winner as Brazil's Fluminense defeated Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal 2-1 on Friday to reach the semi-finals of the Club World Cup.A fine left-foot finish from Matheus Martinelli had put the Rio club ahead in the 40th minute but Al Hilal's Brazilian forward Marcos Leonardo levelled six minutes into the second half before Hercules stole the show to the delight of the vast majority of the 43,091 crowd.Al Hilal had pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament, beating Manchester City 4-3, to reach the last eight and Simone Inzaghi's side fought hard until the end to keep their adventure alive.They bow out of the tournament having been unbeaten through the group stage, including holding Real Madrid to a draw, and having truly made their mark on the world stage.There was a moment's silence before the kick-off in memory of Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota and his younger brother Andre Silva, who died in the early hours of Thursday after their car veered off a motorway in Spain and burst into flames.Al Hilal's line-up featured two of Jota's Portugal team-mates in Ruben Neves and Joao Cancelo.The first half was a tight and tactical affair with few chances until Martinelli opened the scoring when he picked the ball up from Gabriel Fuentes inside the box and span out to give himself space for a left-foot shot that rocketed past Yassine Bounou.Al Hilal went close to a quick response when Kalidou Koulibaly's header forced Fluminense's 44-year-old goalkeeper Fabio into a fine save.The Saudi side were awarded a penalty when Samuel Xavier was ruled to have brought down Marcos Leonardo in the box but Dutch referee Danny Makkelie was eventually sent to the monitor where he overturned his own decision after seeing there had been no contact between the two players.After going in at the break trailing by a goal, Al Hilal came out strongly for the second half and drew level when Koulibaly headed a Neves corner down to Marcos Leonardo who poked home.Al Hilal's Brazilian full back Renan Lodi had a let off when his poor backpass fell straight at the feet of German Cano but the Fluminense striker's attempt to round Bounou was denied by the smart work of the Moroccan keeper.But the outcome was settled with 20 minutes remaining when half-time sub Hercules saw a shot from distance blocked but from the loose ball Samuel headed the ball back to the forward who raced into the box and fired past Bounou to make it 2-1.Al Hilal produced a flurry of corners and some intense pressure in the final minutes as they desperately sought a way to keep their dream alive but the Brazilians were good value for their victory.""We didn’t have many chances but we made the most of them, the entire group worked and were committed,"" said Fluminense coach Renato Gaucho.""Our fans here in the USA and those in Brazil, they can be proud and I ask them to wear a jersey, in the mall, street, beach, wherever, wear that shirt – they should all be proud to wear that jersey,"" he said.The Fluminense coach was full of praise for the performance of his 40-year-old central defender Thiago Silva who ensured the Brazilians were able to withstand the second half pressure from Al Hilal.""Thiago Silva is huge for us, I worked with him 15 years ago, he is a coach on the pitch, very helpful and conveys calm and experience to the others. He is our captain and a leader and in hard matches like these against big clubs, its important to have people like him. He is key and fundamental,"" he said.Al Hilal coach Inzaghi said his side had been unfortunate to end on the losing side.""It has been a good World Cup for us but clearly we leave with a little bit of a bitter taste in our mouth because after what happened in that second half, we deserved much more,"" he said.""It was a tight match, decided by episodes, as happens in football. Fluminense are very well organised team that are having an excellent tournament,"" he added.",Chelsea beat Palmeiras 2-1 to reach the Club World Cup semi-finals in Philadelphia.

Neves and Jota also played together at Wolves in the Premier League before Jota's transfer to Liverpool in 2020.Al-Hilal's head coach Simone Inzaghi addressed the emotional impact of the situation on his players, stating: ""We all know it's a very sad day because of what happened to Diogo and André.These things should never happen. We're all aware of the tragedy. We have two Portugal players Rúben Neves and João Cancelo who were friends to them. Today has been a very difficult day for all of us. We tried to work in the same way but the atmosphere was different. It's a very, very sad tragedy.""Neves shared his feelings through an emotional Instagram post: ""Wherever you are, I know you'll read this. We've never been that stupid and maybe now I regret it a little, but you know what you mean to me as much as I know what I mean to you… Life brought us together and now it can't separate us. We've achieved beautiful things together, we still have a lot to achieve, I know we'll make it. Starting today, you'll enter the field with me, and we'll follow our path together, on the stage where we met.

How the technology works

Can the visually impaired also enjoy the fun and thrill of a Formula E race? Yes, it’s now possible — thanks to a new initiative by Formula E and Google Cloud: an AI-powered audio race report. This initiative promotes inclusivity and makes motorsport more accessible for blind and visually impaired fans. Google Cloud will work with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) to conduct focus groups and user testing during upcoming race weekends in Berlin and London, with a full rollout planned for Formula E season 12.The project was unveiled by Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds at the Google Cloud Summit in London. It uses Google Cloud’s generative AI technology to create rich, descriptive audio summaries of every E-Prix race. These reports will offer fans a dynamic recap that captures the excitement and key moments of each race, available on demand shortly after the chequered flag.The initiative originated from a Google Cloud Hackathon held during the 2024 London E-Prix. It is being developed in close partnership with RNIB to ensure the final product meets the needs of visually impaired users.Sharing his enthusiasm about the collaboration, Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds said, “At Formula E, we believe the thrill of electric racing should be accessible to everyone. This innovative collaboration with Google Cloud is a fantastic example of how technology can be used for good—creating a brand-new way for blind and visually impaired fans to experience the drama and emotion of our sport. By working closely with the RNIB, we are ensuring this innovation is truly inclusive and fit for purpose, so that no fan is left behind. ”John Abel, Managing Director of Specialised Software at Google Cloud, added, “For too long, the visual nature of racing has been a barrier for fans who are blind or visually impaired. Google Cloud's AI technology will act as a digital storyteller, creating a vivid audio narrative that brings the speed, strategy, and excitement of Formula E to life. We are proud to work alongside a partner like Formula E that shares our passion for using innovation to break down barriers and connect people through shared experiences. ”Sonali Rai, RNIB’s Media, Culture and Immersive Technology Lead, also said, “Audio description transforms how blind and partially sighted motorsport fans can fully engage in enjoying the full racing spectacle—taking in the visceral sounds of cars on the track while feeling the passion of the crowd.”She continued, “RNIB has been working with Formula E and Google Cloud on this AI-powered podcast, which promises to give a full picture of the race in an accessible and engaging way for blind and partially sighted fans. Formula E’s commitment to working directly with the community to develop this technology is exactly the right approach. It sets a fantastic standard in inclusivity for other sports to follow and stay on track with new advances in innovation. ”The audio report is generated through a multi-stage process powered by Google Cloud's AI platform, Vertex AI. Google’s Chirp model accurately transcribes live race commentary. Google’s Gemini models analyze the transcribed commentary along with live timing data and other official race information. The AI identifies key events such as overtakes, incidents, and strategic pit stops and generates an engaging, fact-based race summary.Also Read: Berlin E-Prix: From Oliver Rowland’s World Championship win to Felipe Drugovich’s debut, there’s a lot to look forward to The text is then converted into natural, expressive speech using advanced text-to-speech technology, resulting in a polished audio report ready for distribution.

Sebastien Buemi wins third spot on the podium in Jakarta



Sebastien Buemi’s performance in 2025 Formula E season

Coming as major good news for Envision Racing driver Sebastien Buemi, the removal of a time penalty from the last Jakarta race has landed him on the podium. Buemi is now officially promoted to third place, while Nico Mueller, who had originally celebrated a podium alongside Dan Ticktum and Edoardo Mortara at the Jakarta E-Prix, has been moved to fourth.The five-second penalty initially handed to Sebastien Buemi at the Jakarta E-Prix for contact with Mahindra Racing’s Edoardo Mortara was recently overturned following a FIA hearing. Due to the penalty, Buemi had finished eighth in Round 12 of the Jakarta race in June. However, the reversal has now reshaped the podium — much to Mueller’s disappointment.According to FormulaE.com, additional footage from Envision Racing's roll hoop camera, which was not available at the time the penalty was applied, was reviewed in detail. Buemi had received the penalty for an on-track collision with Mortara.The FIA stated: “The driver of Car 16 (Buemi) argued that the new element shows his overtaking manoeuvre was legitimate, that he was always in control of his car, and that when the slight contact occurred, he was fully alongside Car 48 (Mortara).”They further added: “The driver of Car 48 agreed with the assessment and mentioned he barely felt the contact.Upon careful consideration of the circumstances, the Stewards find that no single party bears whole or predominant responsibility for the collision. Therefore, the Stewards decide to reverse Decision 12. As a result, the penalty (i.e., five-second time penalty and one penalty point) on Car 16 is removed, and no further action will be taken in relation to this collision. ”With this update, Buemi moved to 10th in the Formula E Driver Standings with 63 points. In addition to his newly awarded Jakarta podium, he also has one win this season, in the Monaco E-Prix during Round 7.Also Read: Nico Mueller happy with Jakarta podium but adds, “It could have been even better with Jake” Buemi will now head to Berlin for Rounds 13 and 14 of the Formula E season.

IPL 2026 Mini Auction: CSK Go Big on Uncapped Talent | Stephen Fleming & Shashwat Goenka

NEW DELHI: The IPL 2026 auction delivered many big-money headlines, but few stories matched the emotional weight of Prithvi Shaw and Sarfaraz Khan scripting their return to the league after early rejection. Once touted as India’s next batting stars, both were initially left unsold, only to find new life in the accelerated round — a reminder of how quickly fortunes can change at the IPL auction table.Shaw’s journey was the most dramatic. After going unsold twice at his base price of Rs 75 lakh, the former India opener briefly took to social media, posting a heartbreak emoji with the words “It’s OK.”Within minutes, the script flipped. Delhi Capitals, the franchise he represented from 2018 to 2024, revived his name late in the auction and brought him back for Rs 75 lakh. Shaw swiftly deleted his earlier post and shared DC’s welcome graphic instead, captioning it “Back to my family,” sealing a full-circle moment.The 26-year-old has been in strong domestic form and recently made headlines by scoring the second-fastest double century in Ranji Trophy history.Having shifted from Mumbai to Maharashtra this season, Shaw now gets another chance to revive his IPL and international ambitions with a familiar franchise.Sarfaraz Khan’s wait ended in similar fashion. After going unsold in the main round despite a prolific domestic record — including a blistering 22-ball 73 in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy just an hour before the auction started — Chennai Super Kings snapped him up for Rs 75 lakh. For Sarfaraz, the move represents an opportunity to showcase his power-hitting under MS Dhoni’s watchful eye.While Shaw and Sarfaraz embodied redemption, the auction also saw fireworks elsewhere. Kolkata Knight Riders shattered records by signing Australia all-rounder Cameron Green for Rs 25.20 crore, making him the most expensive overseas player in IPL history. KKR also landed Sri Lanka pacer Matheesha Pathirana for Rs 18 crore, while uncapped Indians continued to cash in big.Yet amid the crores and bidding wars, it was the quiet, late picks of Shaw and Sarfaraz that stood out — proof that in the IPL, a comeback is never more than one bid away.","Prithvi Shaw and Sarfaraz Khan return to IPL after early rejection.

Poll Do you think Tejasvi Dahiya's hard training approach will help him succeed in the IPL? Yes, hard work pays off. No, talent is more important.

Tejasvi Dahiya

Tejasvi Singh Dahiya was shattered after his name came up twice at the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction last year, only to find no bidders.A disappointed Dahiya then received a call from his coach Sanjay Bharadwaj — a hard taskmaster and one of the doyens of the domestic circuit, who has coached the likes of Gautam Gambhir, Amit Mishra, Joginder Sharma, Unmukt Chand, Nitish Rana and Priyansh Arya. Bharadwaj asked him to book a train ticket to Bhopal, where the Dronacharya Awardee runs a ‘gurukul’-style coaching setup in the middle of a forest.“I was unhappy after going unsold. When my name came up in the accelerated round, I was hopeful. But when no one lifted the paddle for me, I was shattered from inside,” Dahiya tells TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.Moving to Bhopal, where he had lived in the recent past, was not easy.“Bharadwaj sir even takes away our phones. There is only one hour of entertainment, during which we get our mobiles to talk to our parents,” he says.The 23-year-old turns philosophical and adds, “If you want to achieve something, you have to sacrifice a lot. This is what I believe in.”Dahiya, who shot to fame with his exploits in the Delhi Premier League (DPL), was sold to Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) for Rs3 crore — ten times his base price of Rs30 lakh.Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals (RR) were involved in a bidding battle for the Delhi wicketkeeper-batter.“What Gauti (Gautam Gambhir) bhai did with KKR, I want to repeat that,” says Dahiya.Dahiya was the leading six-hitter in the DPL, smashing 29 sixes and amassing 339 runs at a strike rate of 190.44.“He has that attacking mindset. He has always been like this. He and Priyansh (Arya) used to get into six-hitting competitions at the LB Shastri Academy,” says Bharadwaj.“When I saw him bat for the first time, I imagined the entire picture.(I realised I had found a diamond). At 16, I made him the captain of LB Shastri. He has a mature head on his shoulders. Since he keeps wickets as well, he understands and reads the game really well,” adds the coach.But the journey wasn’t easy for Dahiya. He comes from a family of teachers. His father, Ravindra Singh Dahiya, is a maths teacher, while his mother, Babita Dahiya, is an economics teacher in a Delhi government school.(Neither my parents nor I can believe it),” says Dahiya.“Barring Gujarat Titans, Punjab Kings and Lucknow Super Giants, I went for trials with all the other teams. But I wasn’t sure because of what happened last year,” he adds.Growing up, Dahiya looked up to Virender Sehwag, MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli.“I loved the attacking intent of Viru sir, the six-hitting and keeping of MS, and the discipline of Virat bhai,” he says.Dahiya says he is eager to play in the IPL and show the world what he can do.(I am from Delhi, and we play with full intensity),” says Dahiya.Meanwhile, coach Bharadwaj says he is excited for his ward but cautions him against reckless shot-making early on.“Kids these days go for a first-ball six — there’s a bravado I don’t like. I think he can have a good season and might end up playing all the matches, but he needs to make it count,” says Bharadwaj.",Tejasvi Singh Dahiya was the leading six-hitter in the Delhi Premier League (DPL) The 23-year-old was sold to Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) for Rs3 crore — ten times his base price of Rs30 lakh. He was rejected at last year's IPL auction but rebuilt himself under a gurukul-style training regime in Bhopal.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126009496,imgsize-77864,width-400,resizemode-4/126009496.jpg"

The hefty price tag came after an intense bidding battle between Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings, with KKR eventually prevailing.KKR also showed interest in retaining India all-rounder Venkatesh Iyer but pulled out of the contest as Royal Challengers Bengaluru stepped in to acquire the former KKR star for Rs 7 crore.The three-time champions later re-entered the spotlight during the bidding for Pathirana.

Full squad:

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru entered the IPL 2026 auction with a relatively modest purse of Rs 16.40 crore and eight slots to fill, including two overseas positions, as the defending champions looked to reinforce an already settled squad. RCB are coming off a historic campaign, having won the IPL 2025 title — their maiden championship — after defeating Punjab Kings in the final, and the focus this time was clearly on adding depth rather than overhauling the core.The franchise has retained a strong group of players that forms the backbone of their title-winning side. The batting unit continues to revolve around Virat Kohli, supported by the likes of Phil Salt, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar and Tim David.The presence of wicketkeeper-batter Jitesh Sharma adds flexibility in the middle order, while all-round options such as Krunal Pandya and Romario Shepherd provide balance across departments. In the bowling attack, experience and variety come through Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal and Nuwan Thushara, complemented by young Indian talent.While RCB kept their spending measured, the mini auction itself was dominated by blockbuster deals elsewhere.Australian all-rounder Cameron Green stole the headlines after being snapped up by Kolkata Knight Riders for a staggering Rs 25.20 crore, making him the third most expensive player in IPL history. Chennai Super Kings went all out for uncapped Indian talent, with Prashant Veer and Kartik Sharma becoming the highest-priced uncapped players in IPL history. KKR further made waves by securing Matheesha Pathirana for Rs 18 crore, the highest fee ever paid for a Sri Lankan player at an IPL auction.Overall, all 10 franchises managed to fill the 77 available slots, spending a combined Rs 215.45 crore in a frenetic auction that once again underlined the league’s growing financial muscle.RCB made some valuable additions, headlined by the signing of India all-rounder Venkatesh Iyer for Rs 7 crore, adding proven all-round quality to the squad. They also brought in New Zealand pacer Jacob Duffy for Rs 2 crore and uncapped left-arm fast bowler Mangesh Yadav for Rs 5.20 crore. Young Indian prospects Satvik Deswal, Kanishk Chouhan, Vihaan Malhotra and Vicky Ostwal were secured at their base prices, while England batter Jordan Cox was picked up for Rs 75 lakh.With a championship-winning core intact and smart reinforcements added, Royal Challengers Bengaluru will head into IPL 2026 aiming to defend their crown and build on the momentum of a landmark season.Virat Kohli, Phil Salt, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar, Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Romario Shepherd, Jitesh Sharma, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Yash Dayal, Josh Hazlewood, Suyash Sharma, Abhinandan Singh, Jacob Bethell, Nuwan Thushara, Rasikh Dar, Swapnil SinghVenkatesh Iyer (Rs 7 crore), Jacob Duffy (Rs 2 crore), Mangesh Yadav (Rs 5.20 crore), Satvik Deswal (Rs 30 lakh), Kanishk Chouhan (Rs 30 lakh), Vihaan Malhotra (Rs 30 lakh), Vicky Ostwal (Rs 30 lakh), Jordan Cox (Rs 75 lakh)Rajat Patidar (c), Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Phil Salt, Jitesh Sharma, Krunal Pandya, Swapnil Singh, Tim David, Romario Shepherd, Jacob Bethell, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Nuwan Thushara, Rasikh Salam, Abhinandan Singh, Suyash Sharma, Venkatesh Iyer, Jacob Duffy, Satvik Deswal, Mangesh Yadav, Jordan Cox, Vicky Ostwal, Vihaan Malhotra, Kanishk Chouhan.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru entered the IPL 2026 auction with a relatively modest purse of Rs 16.40 crore.

JAIPUR:

Abhishek Sharma's sister is very proud of her brother, and India win

Almost 15 years ago, Manoj Sharma had resolved to put everything at his disposal into making his son a cricketer. The father was channeling his own unfulfilled dream that had stalled at district-level cricket. On Tuesday, that dedication paid off.Son Kartik Sharma’s unbridled, free-flowing batting attracted a lot of franchises ahead of the mini-auction, but ultimately it was Chennai Super Kings who splurged a mind-boggling Rs 14.20 crore to secure the services of the 19-year-old in Abu Dhabi.Kartik was obviously very happy, but the one thought constantly on his mind was that he could now help his father pay off his debts. According to a local cricket administrator in the know, the family is under a debt of around Rs 27-28 lakh, incurred while shaping Kartik.On Tuesday, he was snapped up by CSK for an amount more than 47 times his base price of Rs 30 lakh.“To play for CSK is a dream come true. I am both excited and nervous. I want to thank my father, for he gave up his job and trained me day in and day out to make me the player I am today,” Kartik told TOI, “My father would be by my side while I practiced. Every day he and I would go to the academy for training, where he bowled to me for hours,” the wicketkeeper-batter added.Manoj Sharma said, “We are thankful to Bharatpur DCA secretary and Lokandersingh Chahar (father of India seamer Deepak) for their support. Yes, we are under debt, but hopefully we will soon be in a position to pay it off.”EARLY START: A young Kartik during his academy days Bharatpur District Cricket Association secretary Shatrudhan Tiwari, who has backed Kartik since the day he arrived at his academy 12 years ago, shared that the youngster’s father was a school teacher who also gave tuitions.“But he gave up his work to train his son, which also led to a rise in debts. The family is under considerable debt. Almost four years ago, Kartik’s mother started working at an Anganwadi, but her earnings were not sufficient,” he added.Kartik’s first visit to an academy was as a five-year-old, when his father took him to India seamer Deepak Chahar’s father’s academy in Agra, 56 km away from Bharatpur.“I remember the father-son duo coming to my academy after they learned about Deepak being trained by me. Manoj told me that he wanted his son to hit big sixes. The father was not being unreasonable — Kartik had this talent from the start,” said Chahar’s father, Lokandersingh.Kartik came into notice with his performances in the under-19 circuit in 2024-25, where he stood out in the Vinoo Mankad and Cooch Behar Trophy.As captain of the U-19 Rajasthan side, he top-scored with 492 runs in the one dayers, including a double-century. He made the cut into the senior side after Kunal Rathore failed to perform and was dropped.","Kartik Sharma's unbridled, free-flowing batting attracted a lot of franchises ahead of the mini-auction.

IPL 2026 Mini Auction: CSK Go Big on Uncapped Talent | Stephen Fleming & Shashwat Goenka

Modest returns for Rajasthan pacer Ashok Sharma

Australian allrounder Cameron Green was expected to fetch the highest price at the IPL mini auction on Tuesday, and he did, going for Rs 25.2 crore to Kolkata Knight Riders. That made him the third-most expensive player ever sold at an IPL auction, and the most expensive overseas player ever.But Green wasn’t the biggest story to come out of the auction, held at Abu Dhabi.Lord Byron, the 19th century English poet, wrote: “I awoke one morning and found myself famous.” Prashant Veer, Kartik Sharma, Auqib Nabi and a bunch of other cricketers found themselves in a similar serendipitous state on Tuesday.Before the bidding began, they were journeymen making a modest living in domestic cricket and local T20 leagues.Now they are IPL’s latest million-dollar babies. The 2026 auction will be remembered as the one where the uncapped, even the unheard, stole the show.The huge sums fetched by uncapped players represent a collective leap of faith by the IPL franchises. Prashant Veer has played just 9 domestic T20 games; Kartik Sharma only 12.Amethi-born Veer, a 20-year-old left-arm spinner-cum-big hitter in the mould of Ravindra Jadeja, was snapped up by Chennai Super Kings for a record Rs 14.2 crore.The highest-ever sum for an uncapped player was equalled by Kartik Sharma, a teenage gloveman from Rajasthan with a penchant for six hitting. He will play for CSK, a team generally conservative in its bidding and often reliant on aging maestros.Unlike the two, Auqib Nabi, a 29-year old medium pacer and handy batter from the restive Baramulla district of Kashmir, has done the hard miles in domestic cricket.The English teacher’s son, who modelled his action on South Africa’s Dale Steyn, was snapped up by Delhi Capitals for Rs 8.4 crore. Several other uncapped young guns also raked in the moolah: left-arm pacer Mangesh Yadav (RCB, Rs 5.2 crore), keeper-hitter Tejasvi Dahiya (KKR, Rs 3 crore), keeper-hitter Mukul Choudhary (LSG, Rs 2.6 crore) and shotmaker Akshat Raghuvanshi (LSG, Rs 2.2 crore), to name just four.The day had other surprises too. Ashok Sharma, whose raw pace had batters in disarray this season and spotters calling attention, went for an unexpectedly modest Rs 90 lakh to Gujarat Titans.","Australian allrounder Cameron Green was expected to fetch the highest price at the IPL mini auction on Tuesday.

Breaking the bank while looking to rebuild from scratch, Kolkata Knight Riders splurged a record-breaking Rs 25.20 crore to rope in Australian allrounder Cameron Green and Rs 18 crore to buy Sri Lankan pacer Matheesha Pathirana at the IPL mini-auction in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday. Overall, the auction saw the 10 teams spend Rs 215.45 crore to buy 77 players, with 369 players going under the hammer.Surpassing compatriot Mitchell Starc (Rs 24.75 crore in 2023), Green became the most expensive overseas player at an IPL auction after KKR prevailed over Chennai Super Kings in a bidding war. However, Green’s salary for the season will be capped at Rs 18 crore, with the excess amount going to the BCCI’s player development programme, as per auction rules for overseas players.Despite a modest IPL record — 707 runs and 16 wickets in 29 matches for Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bengaluru — the intense bidding for Green lived up to its pre-auction billing. KKR managing director Venky Mysore said the franchise was ""happy"" with the price. KKR also bought Tejasvi Dahiya (Rs 3 crore), Finn Allen (Rs 2 crore), Tim Seifert (Rs 1.50 crore), Akash Deep (Rs 1 crore) and Rahul Tripathi (Rs 75 lakh).The 2026 auction turned into a gold rush for uncapped Indian players. In a major shift from their traditional approach, CSK splurged Rs 28.4 crore on Prashant Veer (UP) and Kartik Sharma (Rajasthan), paying Rs 14.2 crore each. Starting at a base price of Rs 30 lakh, the duo became the highest-paid uncapped players in IPL auction history. CSK also bought Rahul Chahar (Rs 5.2 crore), Matt Henry (Rs 2 crore), Akeal Hosein (Rs 2 crore) and Matthew Short (Rs 1.5 crore).Sarfaraz Khan, initially unsold, was picked up for Rs75 lakh after smashing a 22-ball 73 for Mumbai in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy just before the auction. CSK also added Aman Khan (Rs 40 lakh) and Mukesh Choudhary (Rs 30 lakh).Continuing their big-hitter philosophy, Sunrisers Hyderabad bought Liam Livingstone for Rs 13 crore and Salil Arora for Rs 1.5 crore. They also snapped up Jack Edwards (Rs 3 crore), Shivam Mavi (Rs 75 lakh) and Krains Fuletra (Rs 30 lakh).Delhi Capitals paid Rs 8.40 crore for Jammu and Kashmir pacer Auqib Nabi, one of the stories of the auction. Prithvi Shaw returned to DC for Rs 75 lakh after going unsold initially. DC also made smart buys, landing David Miller (Rs 2 crore), Pathum Nissanka (Rs 4 crore), Ben Duckett (Rs 2 crore), Kyle Jamieson (Rs 2 crore) and Lungi Ngidi (Rs 2 crore).Released by LSG, Ravi Bishnoi was snapped up by Rajasthan Royals for Rs 7.2 crore. Along with Ravindra Jadeja and Vignesh Puthur (Rs 30 lakh), RR now boast a strong spin attack. They also bought Adam Milne (Rs 2.4 crore).After missing out previously, RCB landed Venkatesh Iyer for Rs 7 crore, a 70.5% pay cut from the Rs 23.75 crore KKR paid last year for him. RCB also paid Rs 5.2 crore for uncapped pacer Mangesh Yadav and roped in New Zealand quick Jacob Duffy for Rs 2 crore.LSG shelled out Rs 8.6 crore for Australian ’keeper-batter Josh Inglis, while also investing in uncapped Indians Mukul Choudhary (Rs 2.6 crore), Akshat Raghuwanshi (Rs 2.2 crore) and Naman Tiwary (Rs 1 crore). They also bought Anrich Nortje (Rs 2 crore) and Wanindu Hasaranga (Rs 2 crore).Titans snapped up Jason Holder (Rs 7 crore), Rajasthan’s rookie pacer Ashok Sharma (Rs 90 lakh), Tom Banton (Rs 2 crore) and Luke Wood (Rs 1 crore). Ashok was the leading wicket taker in the SMAT league stage.PKBS bought Ben Dwarshuis (Rs 4.4 crore) and Cooper Connolly (Rs 3 crore), along with Vishal Nishad and Praveen Dubey (Rs 30 lakh each).With the smallest purse (Rs 2.75 crore), Mumbai Indians brought back Quinton de Kock for Rs 1 crore and added Danish Malewar and Atharva Ankolekar for Rs 30 lakh each.Prithvi Shaw (DC) Rs 75 lakhSarfaraz Khan (CSK) Rs 75 lakhTom Banton (GT) Rs 2 croreAdam Milne (RR) Rs 2.4 croreCooper Connolly (PBKS) Rs 3 croreJack Edwards (SRH) Rs 2 croreDavid Miller (DC) Rs 2 croreKyle Jamieson (DC) Rs 2 croreAnrich Nortje (LSG) Rs 2 croreLungi Ngidi (DC) Rs 2 croreDevon Conway, Spencer JohnsonMost expensive overseas player: Cameron Green (Rs 25.2 crore)Most expensive uncapped players: Prashant Veer & Kartik Sharma (Rs 14.2 crore each)CAMERON GREEN (KKR) 25.2crore (base price Rs 2crore)LIAM LIVINGSTONE (SRH) 13crore (BP Rs 2crore)MATHEESHA PATHIRANA (KKR) 18crore (BP Rs 2crore)MUSTAFIZUR RAHMAN (KKR) 9.2crore (BP Rs 2crore)JOSH INGLIS (LSG) 8.6crore (BP 2crore)There were some big surprises as some of the costliest Indian buys were also uncapped players.PRASHANT RAMENDRA VEER(20 yrs; CSK): Rs 14.2 crore (base price Rs 30 lakh)An allrounder from Amethi in UP, Veer made an impact in the UP T20 this year, scoring 320 runs at a brisk strike rate of 155.34 for Noida Kings. He was also good with the ball, claiming eight wickets in 10 games. A left-hand batter and left-arm spinner, CSK expects him to fill the void left by Ravindra Jadeja.KARTIK SHARMA(19 yrs; CSK): Rs 14.2 crore (BP Rs 30 lakh)A wicketkeeper batter from Rajasthan, Kartik scored a century on Ranji Trophy debut. But it is his exploits in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament that has grabbed eyeballs. With a strike rate of 163 in the T20 format, CSK would be hoping that Kartik will give their innings the right impetus.AUQIB NABI(29 yrs; DC): Rs 8.4 crore (BP Rs 30 lakh)The pacer from Baramulla in Jammu and Kashmir has been one of the consistent performers in domestic cricket across formats. With his ability to swing the ball both ways, Nabi can be dangerous with the new ball and DC would be hoping to make early inroads by having him in their ranks.RAVI BISHNOI (25 yrs; RR) Rs 7.2 crore (BP Rs 2 crore)VENKATESH IYER (30 yrs; RCB) Rs 7 crore (BP Rs 2 crore)MANGESH YADAV (23 yrs; RCB) Rs 5.2 crore (BP Rs 30 lakh)RAHUL CHAHAR (26 yrs; CSK) Rs 5.2 crore (BP Rs 1 crore)TEJASVI SINGH (23 yrs; KKR) Rs 3 crore (BP Rs 30 lakh)MUKUL CHOUDHARY (21 yrs; LSG): Rs 2.6 crore (BP Rs 30 lakh)SALIL ARORA (23 yrs; SRH)): Rs 1.5 crore (BP Rs 30 lakh)NAMAN TIWARI (20 yrs; LSG); Rs 1 crore (BP Rs 30 lakh)ASHOK SHARMA (23 yrs; GT); Rs 90 lakh (BP Rs 30 lakh)After going unsold in the initial round of auctions, both Sarfaraz Khan and Prithvi Shaw were sold in the accelerated round.

Lionel Messi India tour: Inside story of what went wrong in Kolkata

NEW DELHI: Football legend Lionel Messi on Tuesday departed Jamnagar after visiting Vantara, the wildlife rescue and conservation centre, bringing the curtain down on his much-celebrated GOAT India Tour 2025. Hosted by Anant Ambani at Vantara, the visit marked Messi's final stop before his exit from the country, capping a tour that drew massive crowds and unprecedented attention across four major Indian cities.Jamnagar followed a whirlwind itinerary that took the Argentine icon to Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Delhi, with each stop offering fans a rare glimpse of the World Cup-winning superstar. The national capital hosted the grand finale of the tour, where an on-field programme at Arun Jaitley Stadium served as a fitting conclusion amid huge fan enthusiasm.Messi arrived in Delhi on December 15 along with former Barcelona teammates Luis Suarez and Rodrigo De Paul after completing engagements in Mumbai. The highlight of the Delhi leg was a celebrity football match between the Minerva Messi All Stars and the Celebrity Messi All Stars.Messi later stepped onto the field for a brief interaction with players from both teams and spent time with young footballers, exchanging passes with Suarez and De Paul in moments that left aspiring talents awestruck.The Delhi event concluded with a stage ceremony attended by Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta and several prominent dignitaries, including ICC chairman Jay Shah, DDCA president Rohan Jaitley and former India football captain Bhaichung Bhutia. Jay Shah presented specially curated Indian cricket jerseys to Messi, Suarez and De Paul, while Messi also received a commemorative cricket bat signed by legendary Indian cricketers.Earlier in the tour, Messi graced Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium, where he met Indian football great Sunil Chhetri and cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar. In Hyderabad, he took part in a 7-on-7 exhibition match at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, interacted with Chief Minister Revanth Reddy and met Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi.The tour began in Kolkata but ended amid controversy, with fans expressing frustration over pitch-side overcrowding that limited their view of the football icon. Despite that rocky start, Messi's GOAT India Tour 2025 concluded as a landmark moment for Indian football fandom, leaving behind memories few will forget.","Messi leaves Jamnagar after visiting Vantara, the wildlife rescue and conservation centre.

(Image: AP/Jon Super)

Manchester United and Bournemouth played out a thrilling 4-4 draw at Old Trafford, with United squandering the lead three times and missing the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League. Despite United's strong attacking display under Ruben Amorim's management, their defensive vulnerabilities were exposed as Bournemouth repeatedly fought back to secure a point.Amad Diallo opened the scoring for United in the 13th minute, nodding into an empty net after Petrovic failed to properly handle Cunha's header. The hosts displayed their best attacking form of the season but struggled defensively without injured defenders Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt.Antoine Semenyo equalized for Bournemouth against the run of play in the 40th minute, taking advantage of Luke Shaw's weakness to score his first goal since October 3. United regained the lead before halftime through Casemiro's header from a Fernandes corner, aided by a goalkeeping error from Petrovic.The second half saw Bournemouth score twice in seven minutes through Evanilson and Marcus Tavernier. Evanilson struck just 37 seconds after the restart, while Tavernier converted a free-kick from the edge of the area.United maintained their record of not losing a home league game when leading at half-time since May 1984, as Bruno Fernandes scored from a brilliant free-kick and Matheus Cunha capitalized on Adam Smith's defensive error to make it 4-3.Eli Junior Kroupi leveled the score for Bournemouth with six minutes remaining. The visitors nearly claimed victory in stoppage time, but United goalkeeper Senne Lammens denied David Brooks twice.""It was a fun game for everyone at home,"" said Amorim. ""When you win away you should win at home. The performance today was different from the last two at home. The result is the same, it is frustrating but the performance is different.""""It's very difficult to explain because so much happened,"" said Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola. ""I suppose it was entertaining for everyone. Two teams that attacked much better than we defended.""The result extends Bournemouth's winless run to seven games but moves them up to 13th place. United climb to sixth place, ahead of Liverpool on goal difference.This draw continues United's recent struggles at home, following their failure to defeat 10-man Everton and West Ham in previous matches.The match highlighted United's improving attack under Amorim's leadership, with their expensive forward line showing promising signs despite defensive shortcomings.Mbeumo missed a clear opportunity from close range during the second half, while Petrovic made an uncertain save from Cunha's powerful shot as both teams continued to create chances throughout the match.",Manchester United and Bournemouth played out a thrilling 4-4 draw at Old Trafford.

NEW DELHI:

Fans throw objects, vandalise stadium after Messi leaves early | Hyderabad next

It’s time for reels, memes and thrills. Finally, Lionel Messi graced the Capital with his friends, Luis Suarez and Rodrigo de Paul, and entertained a 30,000 odd gathering of the city’s elite fans at the sun-soaked Arun Jaitley Stadium on Monday.The next most-popular word the city is breathing these days, AQI, hovered around 451 which is marked severe. Braving the unhealthy air, parents escorted their children to catch a glimpse of the Argentinian superstar, who glided into the stadium at half past four in the afternoon, wrapped in a cloud of security personnel. Thankfully, they weren’t over bearing. They allowed the three musketeers from Inter Miami, the MLS Cup winners in football in the US, to take a lap of honour, kick around two dozen footballs into the crowd that went delirious, and enjoy a kickabout with kids. Perhaps, no one alerted them about the Delhi air.Divyansh and Manik travelled all the way from Ludhiana and managed to catch one of the balls that landed in the terraces. They walked out clutching it like a baby. “Cannot frame words to how happy we are,” breathless, they could barely blurt.Academy boys and girls, who got the opportunity to pass the ball to Messi, would remember forever the late afternoon of delight. Something they will share with their grandchildren some 60 years on.The delegates and the fortunate ones who managed a close look at the football legend in a pink tee, were starstruck. Messi, too, regaled them with his boyish grin. Never for a moment, since he landed in Kolkata on Saturday, did the smile leave his face.The unseemly Kolkata incident seemed a distant memory. On Saturday, irate fans ripped up seats and invaded the Salt Lake Stadium pitch after feeling duped by poor organisation where they could barely get a glimpse of the eight-times Ballon d’Or winner despite paying a bomb for tickets. Events in Hyderabad and Mumbai followed without any sore points and the Capital proved no different.However, two serious Messi fans did point out, “The organisers could have arranged something for the kids on the ground rather than keep them waiting for two hours.”Messi’s arrival was delayed by an hour, but one can guess that the children won’t complain.What followed was a photo session with the Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta and chairman of the International Cricket Council (ICC) Jay Shah. Shah presented Messi, Suarez and de Paul with T20 World Cup tickets, a cricket bat, and Indian team jerseys.Former India captain Bhaichung Bhutia also shared the stage with the trio and former India goalkeeper, Aditi Chauhan, got her jersey signed by Inter Miami mates.Ranked 142, India’s struggles on and off the football pitch were a constant source of comparison as Messi walked the stadium waving at the fans. Does he know the dark state of Indian football where the leagues cannot start because there is no one willing to sponsor it? Unlikely. A score or more miles away, across town, the Football House wears a desolate look, frustrated by court hearings and paucity of funds.Dusk descended gently on the stadium. Messi took over the microphone and served the parting shot. “It was beautiful to receive all the love and support. I knew it was there, but to receive it first hand was, well, amazing,” Messi told the crowd, in Spanish. “I will definitely be back.” The crowd cheered, grasping the essence of the words even though the language was alien.Messi spoke the language of football. Everyone present understood it — one and all.","Lionel Messi entertained a 30,000 odd gathering of the city's elite fans at the sun-soaked Arun Jaitley Stadium on Monday.

Delhi’s worsening air quality cast a shadow over Lionel Messi ’s farewell appearance in India, as a section of the crowd at the Arun Jaitley Stadium voiced its anger at the political leadership even while welcoming the global football icon.As Chief Minister Rekha Gupta stepped onto the stage on Monday to receive Messi during the final leg of the GOAT India Tour, chants of “AQI, AQI” rang out from parts of the stands. The reaction came amid hazardous pollution levels in the national capital, with the Air Quality Index touching 498 in the morning before easing slightly to 427 by evening, remaining in the ‘severe’ category for the third consecutive day. Visibility across the city dropped sharply, with a thick haze obscuring the skyline.The chants contrasted sharply with the celebratory atmosphere inside the stadium, where nearly 25,000 fans had gathered to catch a glimpse of Messi. The Delhi leg marked the conclusion of a tour that had begun chaotically in Kolkata but ended on a more organised note in the capital. Spectators packed the stands, many wearing Argentina’s blue and white jersey with the iconic No. 10, while celebrities and dignitaries watched from inside the ground.Messi, speaking briefly in Spanish, thanked the crowd for the affection shown throughout his India visit. He described the experience as intense but unforgettable, saying the love he received exceeded expectations and promising that he would return to India someday, possibly to play a match.After arriving at the stadium, Messi walked around the field smiling, watched the 7x7 celebrity match conclude, and waved repeatedly to the crowd. Alongside Inter Miami teammates Luis Suarez and Rodrigo De Paul, he kicked footballs into the stands during a lap of honour and later felicitated the Minerva Academy football team. The reception was notably freer than in Kolkata, where heavy security and political entourages had limited fan interaction.The tightly scripted 30-minute programme revolved largely around Messi. He was joined on stage by Rekha Gupta, ICC chairman Jay Shah , DDCA president Rohan Jaitley and former India football captain Bhaichung Bhutia towards the end of the event.While Messi mania dominated the evening, the chants inside the stadium underlined a growing public frustration over Delhi’s air crisis, turning a celebratory sporting moment into a pointed reminder of the capital’s ongoing environmental emergency.",Delhi's worsening air quality cast a shadow over Lionel Messi’s farewell appearance in India.

Lionel Messi India tour: Inside story of what went wrong in Kolkata

NEW DELHI: The footballing god descended upon the city, and the Lionel Messi GOAT India Tour, which had begun in disorder, found its finish in Delhi at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, where fans gathered to see a player whose actions on the field often defy explanation. What mattered most was that the tour ended the way it was meant to, after a chaotic opening in Kolkata on Saturday.The stands at the stadium were filled with spectators, while a small group of Indian celebrities and dignitaries watched from inside the ground, as the city played host to one of the world’s most recognisable athletes. For many, it was the chance to be close to a figure who has shaped the sport over the last two decades.Messi spoke briefly in Spanish, a language unfamiliar to most in the crowd, saying, ""Gracias Delhi! Hasta pronto"", a moment that drew a loud cheer from the stands.Addressing the crowd in Spanish, Messi said, ""Thank you for all the affection you have shown us here in India over these days. Truly, it was a unique experience for us to be able to share this. Although it was intense and very short, it was wonderful to receive all this love, which I already knew was there, but experiencing it firsthand was incredible.""He added, ""Everything you did for us over these days was astonishing, pure madness. So thank you all for the love, and we will surely return someday — perhaps to play a match or on some other occasion — but we will definitely visit again. Thank you very much, thank you.""After arriving at the stadium, Messi walked around the ground smiling and watched the 7x7 celebrity match conclude, as spectators — many wearing Argentina’s blue and white jersey with No. 10 — chanted his name. He stood waving to the crowd, something he could not do in Kolkata, where he had been surrounded by politicians and their aides at the Salt Lake Stadium.Messi was later seen kicking the ball towards the stands along with Inter Miami teammates Luis Suarez and Rodrigo De Paul while taking a round of the stadium, which recorded an attendance of around 25,000. He also felicitated the Minerva Academy football team.The programme appeared designed around Messi, and he moved through it smoothly. Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta, ICC Chairman Jay Shah, DDCA president Rohan Jaitley and former India football captain Bhaichung Bhutia were present with him towards the end of the 30-minute event.Earlier in the day, Messi arrived in Delhi for the final leg of the GOAT India Tour after his flight from Mumbai was delayed due to weather conditions. He was scheduled to land around 10:45am, but fog delayed his charter flight. He eventually landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport at around 2:30pm and proceeded to the Leela Palace Hotel for a meet-and-greet with a select group of people.","Messi arrived in Delhi for the final leg of the GOAT India Tour after his flight from Mumbai was delayed due to weather conditions.

'Are we building sport or just celebrating stars?'

Fans throw objects, vandalise stadium after Messi leaves early | Hyderabad next

Indian shooting great Abhinav Bindra struck a thoughtful note on Sunday as the country continued to be swept by what many have described as “Messi mania”. With Lionel Messi currently on a four-city tour of India, set to conclude on Monday in New Delhi with a football clinic at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, Bindra used the moment to raise a broader question about India’s sporting priorities.Bindra was careful to make it clear that his comments were not aimed at criticising Messi. Instead, the Olympic gold medallist asked whether India is truly investing in building a sporting culture or simply celebrating global superstars from a distance.Messi’s India visit began last Saturday with a largely underwhelming stop in Kolkata, before moving more smoothly through Hyderabad and Mumbai. Across cities, the tour has attracted massive crowds, exclusive VIP interactions and intense media coverage. While the enthusiasm highlighted India’s fascination with global sporting icons, the spotlight often extended to politicians and Bollywood celebrities, something that appeared to trouble Bindra.In a detailed post on X, Bindra said he holds deep respect and admiration for Messi, calling him a rare athlete whose journey goes beyond sport. He acknowledged Messi’s rise from a child overcoming physical challenges to a footballer who redefined excellence, and said he fully understands the commercial realities, branding power and appeal of modern sporting icons.However, Bindra admitted that the scale and nature of the celebrations left him uneasy. He expressed concern about the amount of money and energy spent on the four-city tour at a time when India’s grassroots sporting ecosystem continues to struggle for attention and funding.He pointed to the lack of accessible playgrounds, trained coaches and structured development pathways for young athletes, wondering what could have been achieved if even a small portion of the resources spent on high-profile events had been redirected towards these foundations. While he acknowledged that people are free to spend their money as they choose, Bindra said the contrast made him reflect on missed opportunities for long-term impact.According to Bindra, great sporting nations are not built through isolated spectacles but through systems that nurture talent patiently over time. He stressed that inspiration alone is not enough, even when it comes from icons like Messi. What matters, he said, is pairing inspiration with intent and sustained commitment.Bindra concluded by saying that the most meaningful way to honour legends is not through grand gestures or fleeting moments of access, but by ensuring that young children across India have fields to play on, coaches to guide them and a genuine chance to dream. That, he argued, is how sporting cultures take root and how lasting legacies are created.",Lionel Messi is currently on a four-city tour of India.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce prioritize love amid demanding schedules



It has been a very tight scheduled year for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. While their engagement grabbed headlines, much of their relationship unfolded away from flashing cameras. The couple made a deliberate decision to step back from constant visibility, choosing privacy over spectacle while balancing two careers that rarely slow down. That restraint has become the foundation of how they move forward together.Behind the scenes, both stars faced relentless schedules that demanded focus and sacrifice. Swift closed one era only to step straight into another, while Kelce pushed through the physical grind of an NFL season.Yet even as professional pressure mounted, their personal commitment remained steady, guided by intention rather than convenience.Swift entered 2025 carrying the weight of a historic run. New music, major visual projects, and documentaries filled her calendar almost immediately after the Eras Tour curtain closed. The pace left little room to pause, yet it never pushed her relationship aside. According to an insider, “Taylor’s had an incredibly full, demanding year and she’s really proud of everything she’s accomplished,” adding, “She’s worked extremely hard and her schedule has been nonstop, but even with everything going on, she and Travis still put a lot into their relationship.” (Via PEOPLE)Kelce’s year mirrored that intensity in a different arena. Training camps, recovery cycles, and high stakes games kept him locked into football mode through mid December. Even so, the relationship did not slip into autopilot. The same source noted that the pair “really support each other’s careers and understand the demands that come with what they each do,” while emphasizing, “Whenever they can, they make time to be together and really value that alone time. ”That balance has shaped how they approach the next chapter. With professional obligations finally easing, wedding planning is beginning to take focus. Another source previously shared, ""[Taylor’s] been super focused on work commitments and hasn't seen Travis much. She's not kidding when she says she's exhausted. She's ready for a professional break so she can focus on the wedding. She's very excited about planning the wedding. ""Their story continues without spectacle. No constant updates. No overexposure. Just two people who understand what it costs to stay present while building something lasting. In an industry built on excess, that restraint may be the most meaningful statement they make.Also Read: “My favorite teammate”: Josh Allen’s loving words for Hailee Steinfeld reveal why family matters most beyond the football field","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce prioritize love amid demanding schedules.

Philip Rivers appears to have outsmarted the NFL with a Colts return that unlocked huge insurance money,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/philip-rivers-appears-to-have-outsmarted-the-nfl-with-a-colts-return-that-unlocked-huge-insurance-money/articleshow/126028285.cms,"Philip Rivers' NFL Return and 10 more years of health insurance (Getty Images)

Philip Rivers NFL insurance and the business logic behind the comeback



By the time Philip Rivers jogged back onto an NFL field, the surprise had already rippled across the league. At 44, after nearly five years away, his sudden return felt less like a comeback tour and more like a crisis response. The Indianapolis Colts needed stability. Rivers answered the call on short notice, stepping into a fractured quarterback room with calm familiarity and a quiet sense of purpose.What followed was not a fairy-tale ending, but it was far from a spectacle gone wrong. Rivers looked composed, efficient, and comfortable in chaos. More importantly, he sounded grounded afterward, framing the moment not around ego or legacy, but around connection and shared responsibility.“I’m excited to be a teammate again,” he said. “There’s some teammates in their locker room that were here in 2020 — last time we were in the postseason. So, for an opportunity to join arm-in-arm with them and go after it again — I’m not here to be a hero by any means. I’m here to be one of the guys and we know all it’s going to take. It’s tough to win here, but we’re going to give it our best shot.”Beyond the emotional pull of competition, Rivers’ return also reset a clock that matters long after the final whistle.Under NFL and NFLPA agreements, vested players receive five years of league-provided health and dental coverage after retirement. Rivers retired in early 2021, which meant those benefits were nearing expiration. By suiting up again, even briefly, he restarted that five-year window from the date of his last game.This is where context changes the conversation. Rivers is not just planning for himself. He and his wife, Tiffany, are raising 10 children, with ages spanning from toddlers to young adults. His oldest, Halle, is 23 and still qualifies for coverage for several more years. Health insurance, especially for a family of that size, is not a trivial detail, even for someone who earned roughly $244 million during his career.On the field, Rivers showed he could still manage a game, throwing for 120 yards with a touchdown and an interception in a narrow loss to Seattle. Off the field, the decision reflected foresight rather than desperation. It also delayed his Hall of Fame eligibility by five years, another quiet trade-off that suggests calculation, not impulse.Rivers has spent recent years coaching high school football in Alabama, mentoring his son and shaping young players. This return did not erase that chapter. It simply added another layer. As Venus Williams once put it during her own late-career resurgence, “I had to come back for the insurance.” In Rivers’ case, love for the game and smart planning seem to have met at exactly the right moment.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes ACL injury: Tom Brady shares brutally honest rehab advice after facing the same ninth-season setback","Philip Rivers' sudden return to the NFL felt less like a comeback tour and more like a crisis response.

Unverified social media screenshots sparked rumors of a friendship, intensifying perceptions of betrayal. No evidence confirms direct interaction, and officials have remained silent, leaving speculation to shape public perception amid ongoing scrutiny.

Questions grow over Paige Shiver and Kelli Moore as the Sherrone Moore controversy deepens

The fallout surrounding former Michigan football coach Sherrone Moore has shifted beyond playbooks and contracts into deeply personal territory. As investigators and fans continue to dissect what went wrong, attention has increasingly focused on the people closest to Moore, particularly his executive assistant, Paige Shiver, and his wife, Kelli Moore.Online speculation has raised one central question: did the two women have any kind of personal connection before the scandal erupted? While no verified evidence confirms a friendship, the rumors themselves have added emotional weight to a controversy already marked by allegations of workplace misconduct, blurred boundaries, and trust broken on multiple levels.Much of the speculation stems from unverified screenshots suggesting Paige Shiver and Kelli Moore may have followed each other on Instagram.Those images, which surfaced shortly after Moore was arrested on December 10, 2025, have not been authenticated, and neither woman has addressed them publicly. Still, in the court of public opinion, even perceived proximity carries consequences.As Moore’s executive assistant, Shiver occupied a role that sits uncomfortably close to both professional authority and personal access. In high-profile college football programs, assistants often manage more than calendars and emails.They may coordinate travel, field personal requests, and operate in environments where spouses and children are present at team events. Even without direct interaction, the appearance of familiarity can feel unsettling when allegations of an inappropriate relationship surface.University officials have avoided naming Shiver while confirming Moore was fired “with cause” following an internal investigation. That silence has left room for online narratives to flourish, some framing the situation as a “betrayal of mutual confidence” rather than simply a workplace violation.Comparisons to the Ime Udoka scandal continue to circulate, reinforcing how administrative roles tied to family logistics can intensify public backlash when boundaries collapse.What remains clear is what has not been proven. No photos, messages, or statements establish a friendship between Shiver and Kelli Moore. As accounts go private and sources stay quiet, the rumors underscore a larger issue: in modern sports scandals, digital breadcrumbs often shape perception faster than facts.Also Read: Was Paige Shiver forced into an abortion?

Candace Owens is no stranger to controversy, but her latest book has once again placed her at the center of a cultural firestorm, this time for comments aimed squarely at Taylor Swift . In Make Him a Sandwich: Why Real Women Don’t Need Fake Feminism, Owens reportedly devotes a section to dissecting Swift’s past relationships, framing the pop star’s breakups as part of a broader pattern she finds troubling.The remarks have quickly drawn attention online, not only because of Swift’s global fanbase, but because they reopen long-settled chapters from the singer’s personal life. By revisiting old disputes, Owens has reignited debates many believed were firmly in the past.According to reports, Owens focuses heavily on the aftermath of Swift’s split from DJ Calvin Harris, particularly the revelation that Swift helped write Harris’ 2016 hit “This Is What You Came For” under a pseudonym.When the news became public, Harris reacted strongly on social media, writing, “Hurtful to me at this point that [Swift] and her team would go so far out of their way to try and make ME look bad at this stage,” before adding, “Won’t allow it.” Owens interprets that moment as significant, claiming it was the “closest that any man had come to calling out Taylor’s pattern of abuse.”Owens goes further by accusing Swift of weaponizing her fanbase during breakups, writing that the singer “enters relationship after relationship, and then, on the way out, she attempts to utilize an ill-informed army of teens to settle the score.”She also revives a long-quoted criticism from another pop star, noting that Katy Perry once described Swift as “Regina George in sheep’s clothing,” a line Owens includes to bolster her argument about Swift’s public persona.The criticism fits a familiar pattern for Owens, who has built a reputation for challenging high-profile celebrities and cultural figures. In the same book, she reportedly takes shots at Madonna, questioning the icon’s approach to aging. Still, the Swift commentary has drawn the most attention, largely because it revisits personal moments the singer has long moved beyond.For Swift’s fans, the renewed scrutiny feels outdated. For Owens, it appears to be a deliberate attempt to provoke debate by reframing old pop culture conflicts through a modern ideological lens. Either way, the passage has ensured that Swift, once again, finds herself at the center of a conversation she didn’t start.Also Read: Taylor Swift just got the worst birthday gift from her fiancé Travis Kelce as the Chiefs’ Super Bowl dream collapses early","Candace Owens' new book, ""Make Him a Sandwich,"" reignites controversy by dissecting Taylor Swift's past relationships and breakups.

Gisele Bündchen opened up about feeling “so blessed” while embracing life after divorce from Tom Brady,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/gisele-bndchen-opened-up-about-feeling-so-blessed-while-embracing-life-after-divorce-from-tom-brady/articleshow/126005012.cms,"Gisele Bündchen, two years post-divorce from Tom Brady, shared her journey of transformation with Robin Roberts. She described the split as a painful ending but embraced it as a new beginning, focusing on growth and gratitude. Bündchen also discussed co-parenting challenges and her open, yet cautious, outlook on future romance, emphasizing her active role in building her next chapter.

Calling the divorce a painful ending while embracing a new beginning

Nearly two years after her highly publicized divorce from NFL icon Tom Brady, Gisele Bündchen has continued to approach the topic with caution, choosing reflection over spectacle. While the split in 2022 marked the end of one of sports and fashion’s most recognizable marriages, Bündchen has largely kept her most vulnerable emotions private.Occasional magazine profiles and carefully chosen interviews have offered glimpses into her mindset, but not the full picture. That changed in early 2024, when Bündchen sat down with ABC News’ Robin Roberts at her Miami-area ranch. The conversation, now part of the public record, revealed a woman still processing loss but also one firmly grounded in growth, gratitude, and self-renewal.Early in the interview, Roberts revisited a moment when Bündchen described her divorce as the “death of my dream,” prompting an emotional response. Overcome with feeling, Bündchen paused the conversation, saying, “Sorry, guys, I didn’t know … Can I have a little moment?” After collecting herself, she framed her journey not as defeat, but as transformation.“I don’t think you wish for that,” she explained, referring to the end of her marriage, before adding, “I feel so blessed.I had incredible experiences, I learned so much, I had my children … and now I get to create a new season.”That sense of perspective has shaped how Bündchen approaches co-parenting as well. She acknowledged that raising children with Brady comes with challenges, especially given their different parenting styles.“There’s easier days than others,” she admitted, noting that they have “different rules” for their kids. Still, she emphasized accountability and acceptance, stating simply, “I can only control what I do.” The comment underscored her focus on stability rather than conflict.As for her romantic future, Bündchen remained intentionally elusive despite persistent rumors linking her to her jujitsu instructor. When asked if she could open her heart again, she responded, “I think life is full of surprises and I don’t have a crystal ball.” What she does have, however, is clarity and, as she joked, a purple belt in jujitsu.Looking back, the interview now reads less like a moment of heartbreak and more like a milestone. It captured Bündchen standing at the edge of reinvention, no longer defined by the marriage she lost, but by the life she is actively choosing to build next.Also Read: “A much bigger puzzle”: Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady’s divorce followed years of shifting priorities and emotional growth","Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady divorced in 2022.

Jim Harbaugh confirms he’s been texting Sherrone Moore since arrest

""It's a tragedy, I mean, it's the worst days of his life. Keep it together and take care of your family.

That's the message. And getting spiritual guidance is really critical.""

Jim Harbaugh, now leading the Los Angeles Chargers, has broken his silence on one of college football’s wildest off-field stories, he admitted that he has been in contact with Sherrone Moore via text messages since Moore’s arrest and firing from Michigan. It’s not every day you see a high-profile coach acknowledge keeping in touch with a former assistant in the middle of a legal storm, and fans immediately noticed.While Harbaugh didn’t spill the content of those messages, the very fact that he’s communicating with Moore has sparked conversation across the sports world. The timing couldn’t be more dramatic, Moore’s firing and arrest rocked Michigan football and left players, staff, and fans reeling.Even for someone with decades of coaching experience, Harbaugh admitted he’s “still processing” the situation.Harbaugh’s comments came on ""Dan Patrick Show"", his first substantial public remarks on Moore since the scandal broke. He confirmed the texts took place after Moore was fired “for cause” and arrested, signaling that even in the midst of chaos, he felt some personal responsibility to reach out.He didn’t comment on the contents of the messages or weigh in on Moore’s legal situation, but the acknowledgment alone sent a clear message: Harbaugh hasn’t cut ties entirely. In a world where coaches usually stay silent in situations like this, even a small gesture of communication is newsworthy.Moore was fired by the University of Michigan after an investigation revealed he had an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Hours later, Moore was arrested on felony home invasion and misdemeanor stalking and breaking and entering charges, related to an alleged incident at the woman’s home following the end of their relationship.According to prosecutors, Moore entered the woman’s residence, grabbed knives and scissors, and made threatening statements. He pleaded not guilty in court and was released on bond with conditions including a GPS tether and no contact with the alleged victim. The story unfolded rapidly, dominating national headlines and creating an immediate ripple effect throughout the Michigan football program.The scandal hasn’t just affected Moore and Harbaugh. Michigan’s players reportedly feel “very betrayed” by the events surrounding Moore’s firing and arrest, and interim coach Biff Poggi has been tasked with keeping the team together through the turmoil. Meanwhile, the university is actively searching for a permanent replacement, trying to stabilize the program before the bowl games.Also read - Kayla Nicole was seen thirsting over George Kittle’s wife Claire in her latest Instagram post","Jim Harbaugh confirms he’s been texting Sherrone Moore since arrest.

The NBA Cup Finals are on December 16, 2025, between the San Antonio Spurs and the New York Knicks. While fans are excited about the game, not everyone within the league circuit shares the same opinion on Adam Silver’s in-season initiative. Former legend and NBA sports analyst Charles Barkley is quite dismissive of the in-season tournament. He even used words like “embarrassing” and ""ridiculous"" while expressing his honest opinions on the format.The NBA Cup was first announced in 2023 and instantly became a part of that season itself. Commissioner Adam Silver launched the format to keep the interest of both the players and the fans intact during the course of the regular season.Each player from the winning team receives a cash prize. The tournament is divided into stages, with the first one being group play. These performances add to the standing of both the regular season and the NBA Cup tournament. The next stage is the single-elimination knockout rounds.While winning teams and players are earning from the tournament, Charles Barkley is not very supportive of the format. During a recent episode of the Tom Tolbert Show, the NBA analyst decided to open up brutally on his thoughts on the ongoing tournament.He stated, “I think the Cup thing is somewhat embarrassing. I’m disappointed that we have to make an in-season tournament to make these guys more money, so they won’t do load management. ”The former NBA legend made it clear that he had nothing against the players making more money. Adding to his comment, Barkley further stated, “To have to pay these guys extra money to make them play other games – they should play basketball because they’re well-compensated to play basketball. To do an in-season tournament to make them extra money, come on, man. That’s a little bit ridiculous.”Announced on July 8, 2023, the NBA Cup is an in-season tournament. It is a multi-stage one. The first stage is the group play, where there are 6 groups across both conferences. Each group will have five teams. The teams will play four group stage games and then the winner of each group proceeds to the next stage. The next stage is the single-elimination knockout round.

Megan Thee Stallion turns into Klay Thompson’s fashion guide



Klay Thompson and Megan Thee Stallion silence rumors without saying a word



Klay Thompson has always carried a calm presence. This week, fans saw a softer, playful side of the Dallas Mavericks guard through a short video that quickly took over social media. Shot inside a walk-in closet, the clip offered a heartfelt moment with his sweetheart, Megan Thee Stallion , as he was seen receiving fashion advice.The moment arrived during a stretch when public attention around Thompson has leaned heavily toward speculation. Instead of addressing rumors directly, the video spoke for itself. They have comfort, trust, and an easy rhythm between two people enjoying each other’s space.The video, shared on Megan Thee Stallion’s Instagram on December 13, opens with Michael Jackson’s “You Rock My World” playing as Thompson dances through the closet.Megan hands him outfit options with playful insistence, starting with a tan long-sleeve shirt and moving to a matching camouflage tracksuit. Thompson pretends to resist before giving in, smiling throughout.The scene shifts to him wearing the full look she selected, camo pants paired with chains, moving with confidence as Megan dances beside him in a simple white T-shirt and matching shorts. The caption captured the mood perfectly: “Pleaseeeee put that sh*t on baby #stylingmyman.”In recent weeks, online chatter hinted at trouble, fueled by parody accounts and speculation. The video erased that narrative without statements or interviews. It showed their strong connection.Their relationship has grown steadily since summer, from subtle background appearances to red carpet moments at the Pete & Thomas Foundation Gala. Megan once described Thompson as the “nicest person I’ve ever met in my life,” adding, “Oh, we met and it was such a meet cute it was like a f---ing movie. I won’t tell you how and I won’t tell you when, but it was a movie.”Away from social media, the couple has blended lives quietly. Megan cooked Thanksgiving dinner for Thompson’s family and even hinted at shared living space through a photo featuring a house key. Thompson, meanwhile, has continued navigating a demanding season with Dallas.The fashion video was essential for fans to end the aggressive speculation about their split, as it acted as a shield, showing that they are a power couple with nothing to prove.Also Read: Klay Thompson and Megan Thee Stallion's combined net worth in 2025: Earnings, assets, investments, and more","Dallas Mavericks guard Klay Thompson and Megan Thee Stallion shared a short video this week.

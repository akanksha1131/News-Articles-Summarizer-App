India need EIGHT wickets, England 324 runs: Who will come out on top at The Oval?

NEW DELHI: Congress MP and renowned public figure Shashi Tharoor has once again sparked debate around Virat Kohli’s retirement from Test cricket, calling it “premature” and urging the Indian stalwart to return to the longest format. Tharoor’s latest remarks came after India’s spirited 2-2 series draw in England, under new skipper Shubman Gill , who led a young side admirably in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.Despite India fighting back from a 1-2 deficit with a draw in Manchester and a nail-biting win at The Oval, Tharoor couldn’t help but reflect on what might have been with Kohli in the lineup.“I was just admiring Joe @root66’s consistent excellence as England’s hardy perennial at age 35, while @imVkohli, just two years older, languishes in premature retirement,” Tharoor posted on social media, in reply to a debate on Kohli’s potential return.Earlier during the fifth Test, Tharoor had already voiced his emotions, posting: “I’ve been missing @imVkohli a few times during this series, but never as much as in this Test match. His grit and intensity, his inspirational presence in the field, not to mention his abundant batting skills, might have led to a different outcome. Is it too late to call him out of retirement? Virat, the nation needs you!”Kohli, 36, announced his Test retirement in May 2025, ending a stellar 14-year red-ball career with 123 Tests, 9,230 runs, 30 hundreds, and a top score of 254*. He remains India's most successful Test captain in England, with three wins, and was central to several near-misses — including the closely contested 2018 series and the COVID-delayed 2021-22 finale.As Team India embraces a new era, Tharoor’s impassioned appeal may reignite calls from fans and pundits alike for King Kohli’s red-ball encore.","Congress MP and renowned public figure Shashi Tharoor has once again sparked debate around Virat Kohli’s retirement from Test cricket.

Poll What do you think about Mohammed Siraj's performance in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy? Outstanding Good Average

NEW DELHI: India pacer Mohammed Siraj returned to the country on Wednesday, landing in Mumbai after a heroic performance in the recently concluded Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, where India drew 2-2 against England. The 31-year-old fast bowler was the leading wicket-taker in the five-match Test series, finishing with 23 scalps at an average of 32.43.A video of Siraj’s arrival at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport quickly went viral on social media, showing him walking out in crisp black casuals and acknowledging a small group of fans who had gathered to welcome him. Though there were enthusiastic requests for selfies and autographs, Siraj, ever low-key off the field, made a quick exit.Siraj’s performances in England, especially in the absence of Jasprit Bumrah for two Tests due to workload management, elevated his status from support act to spearhead. He produced a six-wicket haul at Birmingham, where his 6/70 helped India gain a 180-run lead, and followed it up with a stunning five-wicket spell at The Oval, triggering England’s collapse from 301/4 to 367 all out.Dubbed ‘Miyan Magic’, Siraj silenced critics who once pointed to his erratic spells, emerging as a dependable and tireless workhorse in overseas conditions. Since his Test debut in 2020, Siraj has bowled 1069.5 overs, taking 123 wickets in 41 Tests—only behind Bumrah in terms of workload among Indian pacers.With his passion, relentless energy, and emotional intensity, Siraj has not just delivered results but has become a symbol of India's evolving pace identity.",Mohammed Siraj returned to India on Wednesday after England series.

Poll Was Harry Brook's shot a turning point in the match? Absolutely, it cost the game No, the team had other chances Maybe, but other factors played a role

R Ashwin didn’t mince his words while talking about the recently-concluded Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy and criticised England cricketers for disrespecting the ""cricketing gods. ""Ashwin slammed England captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum for encouraging what he called reckless cricket.“As a captain, as a coach, you can proclaim to the world that this is your brand of cricket,” Ashwin said on his Hindi YouTube show Ash Ki Baat.“They can say that Brook played the way we wanted him to play, that he embraced our beliefs.“All of this is easier said than done, but Test cricket needs a certain amount of balance. Yes, I agree that this approach got you runs in the first innings, but in the fourth innings, when you're batting on 100 and the finish line is in sight, it becomes your responsibility to see your team through.”Ashwin pointed out Harry Brook’s reckless shot after scoring a fantastic century, which gave India an opening at The Oval.“When he (Brook) walked in at 100/3, England were not in the game at all. He took chances against Akash Deep when England were staring down the barrel, and a big defeat was looming.But when he got out, it was a moment he could have cherished.“He could have walked out of The Oval with his bat held high alongside Joe Root, who was breaking record after record, and could have won the series 3-1 for England. But he played a reckless shot, and that punishment is why England lost the match and ended up drawing the series.“Brook definitely missed that opportunity. Everything fell on Root’s shoulders. And, fortunately for India, the conditions changed. Such things happen when the cricketing gods are disrespected.“The way England disrespected the cricketing gods — even the clouds came together, cried on the pitch, and allowed the ball to move a lot,” Ashwin said.","R Ashwin slams England captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum for encouraging what he called reckless cricket.

Poll Who do you think had a bigger impact on India's performance in the Test series against England? Jasprit Bumrah Mohammed Siraj Both had an equal impact

Former Australia cricketer Brad Haddin has made a bold remark about India’s pace duo Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj Haddin said that Bumrah didn’t win any Test matches for India during the England tour.“India can take a lot out of this — that they can still play without Bumrah,” Haddin said on the YouTube channel LiSTNR Sport.“Life goes on if the other bowlers find a way. They have so much talent over there in India. But he didn’t win a Test match.“I think Siraj likes being the leader of the attack. He’s one of those guys who wants the ball in big situations.Yes, he makes mistakes, but he doesn’t shy away from the occasion. If you have players like that — who aren’t afraid to make mistakes, who can get under the skin of the opposition because of how much they want to be involved — those are the guys you want.”Jasprit Bumrah was released from India’s squad after not being included in the playing XI for the fifth Test against England at The Oval, owing to workload management.Before the five-match series began, chief selector Ajit Agarkar and head coach Gautam Gambhir had stated that Bumrah wouldn’t feature in more than three Tests on the tour due to workload considerations. Bumrah played in the first Test at Headingley, Leeds, followed by the third and fourth games at Lord’s and Old Trafford, Manchester, respectively.In those three games, Bumrah picked up 14 wickets — including two five-wicket hauls — bowling 119.4 overs at an average of 26, making him India’s leading wicket-taker before the fifth Test.Meanwhile, Siraj featured in all five Tests, ending as the highest wicket-taker in the series with 22 scalps, helping India level the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy 2-2.“Mohammed Siraj wanted the ball in that last hour of play. There’s no way in the world he didn’t want to bowl every over to win the game. Yes, he dropped a catch — that was a bad miss.

India's fast bowler Mohammed Siraj delivered a match-winning five-wicket haul on Monday at The Oval, leading India to a thrilling six-run victory over England and leveling the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy 2-2. England, starting as favourites on the final day needing just 35 runs with four wickets in hand, fell short as India's bowlers orchestrated a stunning turnaround in the morning session.Siraj played a pivotal role in dismantling England's batting lineup, first dismissing Jamie Smith with a caught-behind after UltraEdge confirmed a faint edge. He then trapped Jamie Overton lbw with a sharp inswinger, a decision that remained unchanged even after England reviewed it.Prasidh Krishna also played his part in England’s collapse by bowling Josh Tongue with a pinpoint 141 kph yorker, reducing England from 347/6 to 354/9.""I have a wallpaper on my phone that says 'Belief.' And I always believe in myself. I was just focusing on bowling in the right areas. I wasn’t too concerned about conceding boundaries—I just wanted to stick to the plan and take wickets,"" Siraj said after the match.Following Siraj’s heroics, Google India paid tribute to him, taking a cue from his now-viral quote: “I only believe in Jassi bhai,” which he had said about Jasprit Bumrah after India’s 2024 T20 World Cup win.In a clever twist, Google turned that phrase into a tribute to Siraj himself.“Congratulations Team India,” Google India wrote on X, along with an image showing a search for ""I only believe in S,"" where ""Siraj bhai"" amusingly appears as the top suggestion.Earlier, Google India had also tweeted about Siraj downloading an image of the word “Believe” from Google. ""There are Google Searches and then there’s this,"" the tweet read.It was a moment of redemption for Mohammed Siraj in more ways than one. Not only did he make up for the dropped catch of Harry Brook — who went on to score 92 after the reprieve — but he also bounced back from the disappointment of Manchester, where he was the last man out, bowled by Shoaib Bashir while trying to defend.Reflecting on the missed opportunity, Siraj said, “Honestly, I didn’t think I had stepped on the boundary cushion after holding onto the catch. It was a match-changing moment. Harry Brook went into T20 mode after that, and we were behind in that phase. Thanks to the almighty.”He added, “I always have the belief that I can deliver for the team in any situation.”","India's fast bowler Mohammed Siraj took five wickets to lead India to a thrilling six-run victory over England. England, starting as favourites on the final day needing just 35 runs with four wickets in hand, fell short as India's bowlers orchestrated a stunning turnaround in the morning session. Siraj played a pivotal role in dismantling England's batting lineup, first dismissing Jamie Smith with a caught-behind. He then trapped Jamie Overton lbw with a sharp inswinger, a decision that remained unchanged even after England reviewed it.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123109064,imgsize-36572,width-400,resizemode-4/123109064.jpg"

Former England captain Nasser Hussain said it would have been a travesty if England had won the Test series 3-1 and added that Mohammed Siraj taking the final wicket was a fitting end to an exhilarating series.“The final scoreline was well and truly deserved by India, and it was very fitting for Siraj to get the final wicket,” Hussain told Sky Cricket.“It would have been a travesty had England won the series 3-1. India deserved to make it 2-2 for the amount of good cricket they’ve played in this series.”The tireless Mohammed Siraj’s warrior spirit steered India to a series-levelling six-run victory over England in the fifth and final Test on Monday, bringing a fitting end to one of the most intensely fought and drama-filled contests in recent memory.With four wickets in hand and just 35 runs to get, England held the edge at the start of the final day. But the gladiator in Siraj made life miserable for the opposition batters from the very first ball.In the end, his fiery effort—well supported by Prasidh Krishna at the other end—left England short by the narrowest of margins and allowed India to sign off with a 2-2 draw in the high-pressure five-match series.The decision to call off play early on Day 4, following a brief spell of rain, drew criticism from the likes of Stuart Broad and Michael Vaughan.However, it seemed fitting that the decider extended into the final day, with both teams battling tooth and nail until the very end.With all five Tests going into the final day, Hussain also highlighted why the “Big Three” — India, Australia, and England — must safeguard the future of Test cricket.“Why do people knock this format? It’s just so wonderful. But I’m afraid other countries don’t have the luxuries that England, India, and Australia enjoy,” Hussain said.“The crowds throughout the whole series were incredible — pretty much sold out every day. Even today, there was a sell-out crowd for just 40 minutes of play.“Not every country has that privilege, so England, India, and Australia must keep an eye on the future of Test match cricket. If we let this go, we’re doing the game a disservice. We need to keep pushing it forward,” he added.","Former England captain Nasser Hussain says it would have been a travesty if England had won the Test series 3-1.

Former England captain Graham Gooch believes the intense five-match Test series between India and England is crucial for the future of Test cricket, while expressing concerns about the format's sustainability if it remains dominated by just the ""big three"" nations - India, England, and Australia. Speaking on the sidelines of the fifth Test in London, the 72-year-old cricket legend emphasized the need for the ICC to support financially weaker cricket nations to ensure Test cricket's survival beyond the major powers.The current trend shows most Test cricket being played between India, England, and Australia in five-match series, while financially weaker nations like West Indies, South Africa, and New Zealand typically participate in shorter two or three-match series.""I think the ICC needs to look at Test cricket and need to look at how they can support the less financially well-off countries. I won't say smaller countries, but less financially (well off),"" Gooch told PTI.""Because you've got to preserve Test cricket. You can't just play three teams. If other teams, like New Zealand, West Indies, South Africa, play less and less Test cricket, no one will have anyone to play against.So they've got to support the game on a whole,"" said Gooch, who scored 8900 Test runs for England.Gooch praised the quality of cricket displayed in the current India-England series, noting its importance for the Test format."" It's been an amazing series and really, really good for Test Cricket. Because we know that franchise cricket is all over the place in the world and Test cricket is under pressure,"" Gooch stated.Despite the retirements of veteran players Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli , Gooch expressed confidence in India's new generation of cricketers.""Look, one door closes, another one opens. You can't expect, great players or any players to play on forever. There is a time when they decide that they've had enough or come to retirement or whatever. Those two players you mentioned, have been wonderful servants for India and for our great game. It's time for other people to step in. I think the young Indian players have done brilliantly,"" he remarked.Gooch particularly praised Indian captain Shubman Gill , who has scored 754 runs in the series, approaching Sunil Gavaskar's all-time Indian record.""The captain's an outstanding player. I think his technique is superb. His concentration and his temperament over this series has been brilliant. You've got to remember that your job, or his job, is to score runs. He's not put in the team just to be captain. He's in the team to score runs,"" Gooch commented.The former England captain addressed England's dependence on Ben Stokes , whose absence in the final Test affected the team's bowling capabilities.""Stokes, to me, has been a phenomenon this season. I mean, he's a key player for England because he balances the side. If he doesn't play, England have to go a batsman down. And if they go a batsman down, we're not good enough to have four bowlers. We need five bowlers. To have a four-bowler bowling attack, in my opinion, you need two world-class bowlers. And England don't have that at the moment,"" he explained.Gooch drew parallels between Stokes and India's Mohammed Siraj for their dedicated bowling performances.""Siraj, I've got a lot of time for him. Very passionate, puts it in every time. And Ben Stokes is a similar sort of character. When he walks across the white line, he empties the tank. You understand what I mean by that. He doesn't leave anything behind. He gives it everything,"" Gooch said.Regarding the on-field tensions during the series, Gooch viewed them as natural outcomes of competitive cricket.""There's a lot of passion in international cricket when you're playing against a country, when the series is very competitive and very tight. And sometimes, tempers flare a little bit and things are said that maybe you regret. But, it all happens in the spur of the moment. And I think it's two teams going very hard at each other and trying to win the game. I don't think it's carried on afterwards,"" he concluded.","Former England captain Graham Gooch believes India-England Test series is crucial for Test cricket's future.

shakeup

Once all the media formalities were completed, the Indian team whizzed out of the Oval fast on Monday afternoon. They reached the team hotel and had a short customary celebration before dispersing. If one went out for a stroll in the evening on the stretch from Oxford Street to Piccadilly Circus, one could have casually bumped into a few members of the Indian team.Prasidh Krishna was there with his family. Kuldeep Yadav hopped stores with former India leg-spinner Piyush Chawla. Arshdeep Singh too had his family with him. Head coach Gautam Gambhir checked out of the team hotel by evening. Captain Shubman Gill had his friends and family over to celebrate a memorable tour that has placed him at the centre of Indian cricket ’s power centre. The coach-captain duo has come out of their first assignment with flying colours, having drawn the five-Test series, including the dramatic six-run win in the fifth Test on Monday.Bigger milestones now beckon. Before this tour, there had been discussions around the future of the coach-captain combination. Having settled all the doubts, now it’s time for the two to set concrete plans for the future.Gill landed in England with an Indian team in the first week of June with questions being raised about his inexperience.Now he deserves to go off the constant high-performance routine of an India cricketer for a few days.Meanwhile, Gambhir’s tenure as India’s head coach has revolved around his strong people-over-individuals philosophy. He is also a coach who came into the Indian dressing room to wipe out the superstar culture.Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravichandran Ashwin retired from Test cricket before the selectors could get down to planning for the English summer. Jasprit Bumrah, the biggest name after Kohli and Rohit, declared he was available for only three of the five Tests.India boarded the flight from Mumbai to London after a disastrous first six months in Test cricket under Gambhir. The ICC Champions Trophy triumph in March aside, Gambhir knew he had to deliver. Not that there was any immediate threat to his position, but a drubbing with a fresh team here would have been detrimental to his reputation. The first thing he did was to instill enough conviction in Gill and the team.“Before the start of the series, Gauti bhai (Gambhir) said that we are a young team, but we don’t want to be looked at as a young team. We want to be looked at as a gun team’. The way we played today showed why we are a gun team,” Gill said. This has also been Gambhir’s line of thinking. After India pulled off a draw in the fourth Test in Manchester, having trailed almost throughout the match, a typically combative Gambhir decided to front up to the media. “I don’t like to call this a team in transition. I will say they are inexperienced,” he had said.There is this unmistakable aversion to the word ‘transition’. “Even if there was no transition or if we had the old players, everything would have looked good if batters and bowlers performed,” Gill said. Then he went on to highlight his batting lineup’s stellar performance in the series.“Almost every batter in the series has performed. They have scored hundreds. They have scored runs in crucial and crunch situations,” he mentioned, offering enough hints that this team management had moved on long before the world could.Gill’s confidence in his batting lineup is backed up by numbers. Gill himself scored 754 runs while KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja finished with more than 500 runs. Rishabh Pant scored 479 runs in the seven innings he batted before suffering a broken foot. Yashasvi Jaiswal finished with 412 runs.On the topic of transition or inexperience, Gill has been bullish about the potential of his team. He believed the scoreline before the fifth Test wasn’t a true reflection of the cricket India have played. He maintained that even after the win on Monday. For him, even if India had lost the last Test, the scoreline wouldn’t have been a fair one.The plans will be taking shape soon. There is a certain assertion in Gill’s speech now which suggests he is a man who is firmly in charge. He is already looking ahead.Handling BumrahThat India managed to win two Tests on the tour without Bumrah playing must have settled a lot of nerves. TOI understands that Bumrah will either play an entire Test series or sit out of it in future. So, it could come down to picking either the two-Test series against West Indies at home in Oct before South Africa come in Dec for another two Tests. India don’t have another five-Test series in two years. With the team expected to play on spin-friendly pitches in India, there won’t be much load on the pacers. The selectors and Bumrah can comfortably plan his availability for white-ball tournaments like the T20 World Cup at home in Feb-March next year.With Gill and Gambhir striking a cord, there could be a temptation to revisit the ODI leadership group going forward. Gill is already the designated vice-captain in the ODI format. His consistency with the bat makes him indispensable.With incumbent Rohit Sharma not being a certainty for the 2027 ODI World Cup in South Africa, there are murmurs in the board that if a new captain had to take charge, he should get a fair time to shape the ODI team according to his philosophies. India don’t play much ODI cricket in the build-up to the 2027 World Cup.",India captain Shubman Gill had his friends and family over to celebrate a memorable tour that has placed him at the centre of Indian cricket’s power centre.

The 2025 edition of The Hundred kicked off at Lord’s on Tuesday with a wave of nostalgia, especially for fans of the Indian Premier League franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH).In a moment that melted hearts, two modern-day greats and former SRH stalwarts David Warner and Kane Williamson were seen walking out to bat together for London Spirit, evoking memories of their time as batting partners in Hyderabad’s orange.The official social media handle of Lord’s Cricket Ground shared the heartwarming video, capturing the duo emerging through the iconic Lord’s long room and stepping onto the field. The caption read: “A video @SunRisers fans will enjoy!”Between them, Warner and Williamson have represented SRH for over a decade — Warner for seven seasons and Williamson for eight. Their chemistry and calm aggression were a cornerstone of SRH’s success in the IPL, including their 2016 title win.However, the fairytale reunion didn’t translate into success for London Spirit on the night. Defending champions Oval Invincibles outclassed the Spirit, bundling them out for a paltry 80 in 94 balls, with Rashid Khan (3/11) and Sam Curran (3/18) leading the charge. The Invincibles chased down the target in just 69 balls, winning by six wickets.Post-match, Rashid reflected on his performance and preparations: “It was nice to get off to a winning start... There was spin on offer. I mixed things up and it worked well.”Adding to the spectacle, play was briefly halted by an unexpected intruder — a fox that darted across the ground, drawing laughter and cheers from the Lord’s crowd.","The 2025 edition of The Hundred kicked off at Lord’s on Tuesday.

Poll Do you agree with Dinesh Karthik's critique of the Indian cricket team's management? Yes, I fully agree. No, I disagree.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Dinesh Karthik has delivered a pointed critique of the team management under head coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Shubman Gill , saying the duo took an overly defensive approach during the recently concluded Test series in England, which ended in a 2-2 draw.While India’s young side showed commendable fight to bounce back after trailing 1-2, Karthik suggested the team’s composition reflected a fear of losing rather than a hunger to win.“You could almost argue they picked a team not to lose,” Karthik said on Cricbuzz. “He [Gambhir] is now getting his way, so he will be responsible for everything that happens in the Indian team. If it does well, credit to him. If it doesn’t do well, he should put his hands up and say, ‘we made a mistake’.”Karthik stopped short of blaming captain Shubman Gill, indicating that Gambhir appears to be the primary force behind team decisions.“He [Gambhir] has taken control of the team I feel. He is the driving force of this team with Shubman,” he remarked. “The one thing that I feel he can do is almost look at being serious about picking 20 wickets as much as he feels depth in batting is important.”He added that while Gambhir has a strong track record in white-ball formats, he is still finding his feet in the red-ball arena.“He’s a terrific white-ball coach and the results have been there for us to see. But, in Test cricket, he is also learning on the job.”Under Gambhir's tenure so far, India have suffered a 0-3 whitewash at home to New Zealand — the first in their Test history — and a 1-3 loss in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia. They also failed to reach the World Test Championship final for the first time.Karthik also weighed in on Jasprit Bumrah ’s workload management and dismissed narratives suggesting India win more without him.“You have to look at it from Jasprit Bumrah’s point of view. I think, these kind of wins, the way the series has panned out, the way the young team has fought, it will actually help him in his career. I believe Jasprit Bumrah will be very proud of this young bowling attack,” he said.“The stat of India winning when he doesn’t play is not his mistake. He is so impactful that others pale in comparison. I hope he will have a longer career, knowing he can pick and choose matches. Two back injuries, one nasty ACL that he had — it’s not easy.”","Former India cricketer Dinesh Karthik has delivered a pointed critique of the team management under head coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Shubman Gill.

WATCH the wild visitor here:

In one of the rarest interruptions seen in cricket, a fox stole the spotlight during the season opener of The Hundred 2025, halting play momentarily and delighting a packed Lord’s Cricket Ground in London.The bizarre moment occurred during the high-octane clash between London Spirit and defending champions Oval Invincibles, when the game was suddenly interrupted — not by rain or an injury — but by a small, swift fox darting across the field.The fox appeared just as London Spirit pacer Daniel Worrall was about to deliver a ball. With the Invincibles needing 72 runs more to win, the animal sprinted across the playing surface, seemingly unaware of the chaos it caused. The sight of the furry intruder triggered loud cheers and laughter from the Lord’s crowd, and even the usually composed commentators Stuart Broad and Eoin Morgan couldn’t contain their amusement as the cameras followed the fox’s every move.Sky Sports Cricket captured the moment, sharing the clip online — where it quickly went viral.The fox eventually scampered across the boundary rope, bringing an end to the surprise interlude.Play resumed minutes later, but not before the moment etched itself as one of the quirkiest starts to a cricket season.On the cricketing front, the Oval Invincibles cruised to a six-wicket win, chasing down London Spirit’s modest total of 80 in just 69 balls. Rashid Khan and Sam Curran were the standout performers with the ball, both claiming three wickets each to dismantle a Spirit lineup that featured stars like David Warner, Kane Williamson, and Ashton Turner.Rashid, who took 3 for 11 and was named Player of the Match, said after the game: “It was nice to get off to a winning start… I haven’t bowled in the last couple of months but the amount of cricket I have played in the last ten years, that really helps.”While the Invincibles made a dominant start to their title defense, it was the fox at Lord’s that truly captured hearts.","A fox interrupted a cricket match between London Spirit and the Oval Invincibles at Lord’s.

NEW DELHI: India captain Shubman Gill showed remarkable consistency in his approach and demonstrated respect for “good balls” en route to a record-breaking 754-run tally in the Test series against England, cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar said on Tuesday.While Gill narrowly missed surpassing Sunil Gavaskar’s record of most runs by an Indian in a bilateral Test series (774), he did eclipse Gavaskar’s mark of most runs by an Indian captain in a series (732). With 754 runs, Gill now sits second on the all-time captains' list, behind only Sir Don Bradman, who scored 810.""Shubman batted brilliantly throughout the series. He looked calm, composed and organised,” Tendulkar said in a series of videos posted on Reddit.“When it comes to quality batting, you got to have a clear head and a game plan -- how you're going to build your innings -- and he was extremely consistent as far as his thought process was concerned, because it reflects on your footwork.""""If you're not clear in your head, your body doesn't respond accordingly. His body was responding brilliantly. He looked so much in control. He had so much time to play the ball and there was precision to his footwork,” he added.Tendulkar highlighted Gill’s ability to deal with quality deliveries as a key strength.""The most important thing that I noticed was the respect to a good ball, where the tendency sometimes is to push the ball on the front foot, even if it's not close to your foot,"" he said.""He was able to defend there and consistently defend well on front foot. If you look at how he batted throughout the series, I felt that his front foot defence was solid. His ability to leave the ball was very good. Overall, shot selection was very, very good and precise.”Tendulkar was also full of praise for pacer Mohammed Siraj , who led India’s bowling attack during the five-match series and picked up 23 wickets, including a match-winning spell at The Oval in the final Test.""Unbelievable. Superb approach. I like his attitude,” Tendulkar said.""I love the spring in his legs. If you don't look at the scoreboard and you just look at his body language, you will not be able to make out whether it is on a day Siraj has taken five wickets or has got nothing – the body language is the same.""""(Siraj's) attitude and approach are the same. If a fast bowler is constantly in your face like that, no batsman likes that,” he said.The batting maestro noted that while India were slightly off the mark during England’s strong partnership between Joe Root and Harry Brook on Day Four, the team responded impressively the following day.""The team played like a solid unit. From the time they walked out on the field (on Day Five), everyone looked charged up and focused. As we say, planning-wise, there was a definite plan. There was much more discipline in their approach, especially the bowlers,” he said.""If you notice, on the fourth (day) evening, I think they were lacking a bit of discipline and that invariably happens when there is a partnership (and) two batters are playing an attacking game,"" he added.Tendulkar spoke about wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant, saying that while he has figured out his game, he should not be overly scrutinised for his shot selection.""He has developed a good habit of playing impactful innings. He's figured out his game. There were occasions where people felt that he didn't need to play a certain shot, but someone like Rishabh should be left alone,"" Tendulkar said.""I'm not saying that (he should attack) when you're looking to save a match -- then obviously he has to have a different approach. But if it's the first innings, or the second innings, or the third innings, or even for that matter, if he's playing in the fourth innings, in which situation (allows), that he's figured out.""Tendulkar called senior all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja an ""underrated player"" who doesn't always get the credit he deserves.""I would say, an underrated player. The way he contributes, he doesn't get that much credit. As a batter, he has been remarkable in this series. Not only in this series, but if you notice many times, he'll come and he'll rattle the opposition,"" he said.He also lauded Yashasvi Jaiswal ’s fearless approach and maturity at the crease.""He (Jaiswal) has impressed me because of his mindset. Because he is a fearless batsman and he knows when to accelerate, when to play and (take a) run, (and) when to go to the non-striker end. I think a batter needs to understand that,"" he said.Tendulkar was equally impressed by KL Rahul ’s composed and disciplined batting.""It's possibly one of the best that I've seen him (Rahul) bat. The way he was defending, close to the body and the way he was leaving the ball, I thought he was completely organised,"" he said.""He knew where his off stump was and where to leave the ball. I almost got this feeling that sometimes he was able to frustrate the bowler,"" he added.","India captain Shubman Gill showed remarkable consistency in his approach, says Sachin Tendulkar. Gill scored a record-breaking 754 runs in the five-match Test series against England. Gill narrowly missed surpassing Sunil Gavaskar’s record of most runs by an Indian in a bilateral Test series.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123124128,imgsize-50056,width-400,resizemode-4/123124128.jpg"

The future and well-being of our players, staff, and their families is of utmost importance to us, and we are in touch with them as we wait for a resolution.”While this suspension applies to first-team operations, the club has assured that its youth development programmes and grassroots operations remain unaffected: “The Club remains committed to growing and developing the sport and our operations with our youth teams – men and women – and BFC Soccer Schools remain unaffected by this decision.

On July 16, he wrote on X: “It began with worrying about how I am on borrowed time with what I have left in the tank. But speaking with players from across clubs, I’ve realised that my selfish problem isn’t as important.“Everybody in the Indian football ecosystem is worried, hurt, scared about the uncertainty we are faced with.”The AIFF is expected to meet with club CEOs soon in an attempt to find common ground and salvage what remains of the season.",Bengaluru FC have announced the indefinite suspension of salaries for its first- team players and staff.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins. He was pushed from second place to third, with Cassidy in second. Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor. Massive congratulations. You are the future of this sport.”Recalling Barnard’s maiden pole, a fan also wrote, “Fantastic season, Taylor, we'll never forget that Monaco pole.”Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Barnard claimed five podiums in his first full season in Formula E.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

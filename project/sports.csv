Poll How impressed are you with Nikhil Chaudhary's debut performance in the BBL? Very impressed Somewhat impressed Neutral Not impressed at all

In 2024, during the Big Bash League (BBL), Nikhil Chaudhary caught everyone’s attention against Glenn Maxwell’s Melbourne Stars when he smashed 32 off 16 balls, including a six off Pakistan speedster Haris Rauf.Former Indian state cricketer Nikhil Chaudhary is turning heads in Australian domestic cricket for Tasmania in the 2025-26 season.He became only the second Indian cricketer after Unmukt Chand to play in the BBL and emerged as one of the x-factors for Hobart Hurricanes in his debut season.Nikhil Chaudhary is now set to embark on another chapter of his career with a potential debut in Australia’s premier red-ball competition, the Sheffield Shield, this weekend.If selected, it would mark his first-ever first-class appearance, having played List A cricket for Punjab in India but never featuring in the Ranji Trophy.When Nikhil represented Punjab, he shared the dressing room with some of India’s superstars, including current Test captain Shubman Gill, T20 star Abhishek Sharma, pacer Arshdeep Singh, seasoned quick Siddharth Kaul, and legends like Yuvraj Singh and Harbhajan Singh.Earlier in September, Chaudhary made his List A debut for Tasmania in the One-Day Cup opener against New South Wales at Cricket Central in Sydney, where he took 2-39. He followed it up with 67 off 49 in his second game against Victoria.His journey to this point has been anything but conventional. After moving to Australia, Chaudhary rebuilt his career from the ground up, starting with club cricket and weekend tournaments. His persistence paid off with a Big Bash League debut for the Hobart Hurricanes and eventually a state contract with Tasmania.“This debut is very close to my heart,” Chaudhary said. “When I left India, I never thought I’d get another chance to grab a state contract. Starting again from local club matches here in Australia, and now walking out in a state jersey, it feels like a dream come true.”Cricket Tasmania High Performance General Manager Salliann Beams praised Chaudhary’s determination:“Nikhil’s story is one of perseverance. Many players struggle to adapt after moving countries, but he kept pushing, kept scoring runs, and showed resilience to not only make his debut for the Hurricanes, but now for the Tigers ODC side. His experience in India and his hunger to prove himself make him a great asset to our squad.”Indian players featuring in Australian domestic cricket remains a rarity. Back in the 1960s, former India cricketer Rusi Surti made history by playing for Queensland after representing Gujarat in the Ranji Trophy. Chaudhary’s journey now adds a modern chapter to that legacy.“From Punjab to Tasmania, it has been a long road,” Chaudhary reflected. “I hope my story shows that no dream is too far if you keep working for it.”Alongside Chaudhary, the Tigers squad features Australian international Nathan Ellis and all-rounders Mitch Owen and Beau Webster.","Former Indian state cricketer Nikhil Chaudhary is turning heads in Australian domestic cricket for Tasmania in the 2025-26 season.

Poll Should commentators focus solely on sports and avoid mentioning political regions? Yes, keep it neutral No, context matters

Sana Mir's post

The ICC Women’s World Cup 2025 was marred by controversy on Thursday after former Pakistan captain and commentator Sana Mir came under heavy criticism for an on-air remark referring to “Azad Kashmir”.The incident occurred during Pakistan’s opening clash against Bangladesh, when Mir, while describing batter Natalia’s cricketing background, said: “…captaining a very young side. Yes, they have won the qualifiers, but a lot of these players are new. Natalia who comes from Kashmir Azad Kashmir , plays in Lahore a lot of cricket. She has to come to Lahore to play most of her cricket there.”The remark immediately drew reactions across social media, with Indian fans tagging the ICC and BCCI , demanding her removal for allegedly politicising the broadcast.With the ICC known for its strict stance on neutrality, the debate over whether Mir’s words crossed a line quickly escalated.In response to the backlash, Mir posted a three-paragraph clarification on X, stressing that her words were taken out of context.“It’s unfortunate how things are being blown out of proportion and people in sports are being subjected to unnecessary pressure. It is sad that this requires an explanation at public level,” she wrote.Sharing a screenshot of a popular cricket website, where her birthplace is mentioned as ""Azad Kashmir"", she clarified that her intention was only to highlight a player’s background and resilience: “My comment about a Pakistan player's hometown was only meant to highlight the challenges she faced of coming from a certain region in Pakistan and her incredible journey. It is part of the story telling we do as commentators as where the players come from. I did that today for two other players coming from other regions, too. Please don’t politicise it. As a commentator on the World Feed, we are meant to focus on the sport, teams, and players, highlighting inspiring stories of grit and perseverance. There is no malice in my heart or any intention to hurt sentiments.”She further attached a screenshot of her research sources, noting: “I realise that they have changed it by now, but this is what I was referring to.”Meanwhile, on the field, Bangladesh cruised to a dominant seven-wicket victory over Pakistan.Chasing 130, they reached 131 for 3 in 31.1 overs, with opener Rubya Haider anchoring the innings with an unbeaten 54 off 77 balls, supported by Sobhana Mostary’s 24 not out. Earlier, Pakistan were bundled out for 129 in 38.3 overs, with Rameen Shamim (23) and Fatima Sana (22) offering brief resistance.Bangladesh’s bowlers Shorna Akter (3 wickets), along with Marufa Akter and Nahida Akter (two each), ensured a comprehensive win that overshadowed Pakistan’s shaky batting display.","Former Pakistan captain and commentator Sana Mir came under heavy criticism for an on-air remark referring to “Azad Kashmir” The incident occurred during Pakistan’s opening clash against Bangladesh.

Poll Do you think Tilak Varma's performance was crucial in winning the Asia Cup? Yes No

NEW DELHI: Winning the Asia Cup was the ""best reply"" to an aggressive opposition, middle-order batter Tilak Varma said on Tuesday, revealing how he handled initial pressure and verbal volleys from Pakistan players en route to his match-winning half-century in the final. Tilak scored an unbeaten 69 to guide India to a five-wicket victory over their arch-rivals at Dubai last Sunday.""There was some pressure and nerves initially. But I have placed my country ahead of everything else and I wanted to win the match for the country. I knew if I succumbed to the pressure at that time I would be letting down myself and 140 crore people of the country,"" Tilak said after arriving from Dubai.""I believed in the basics that I learned as a young cricketer from my coaches and executed it. The best reply to them was to win the match and that's what we did,"" he added.Tilak admitted that the Pakistan players indulged in intense sledging during the match, but he chose to remain silent while chasing 147.""After Operation Sindoor, they came hard on us. We have replied in a good way to them by playing sports the way it should be played. We lost three wickets quickly and things were a bit heated up then.""I came to bat a bit earlier than normal. But I did not say anything or play a rash shot, as it would have let the team and country down then,"" he said.However, the Hyderabadi revealed that he spoke his mind to the Pakistan players only after India surpassed the target.""During the match, I was just focusing on my basics, I was not ready to answer them. Whatever I want to tell them I told them after the match and not when the game was going on.""There were a lot of things happening in the middle but I can't reveal all of them. Those things happen in India vs Pakistan matches and they are part of the game. But our focus was on winning the match,"" he said.India needed 10 runs off the final over bowled by pacer Haris Rauf, and Tilak said he was able to stay calm under pressure.""I was calm under pressure (in the last over). I knew that I will win the game. I was just thinking about my country and was focussing on one ball at a time. I backed myself to deliver for the country and I am so proud of it,"" he added.Unsurprisingly, Tilak described the innings as one of the best of his young career.""I would rate this as one of the best innings. (Along) with this, I could also rate one more innings which I played earlier in Chennai against England (an unbeaten 72 that steered India to a two-wicket win).""Of course, playing in the Asia Cup, that too against Pakistan under pressure, is one of the greatest feelings. So, I would rate this as my one of the best innings compared to my two hundreds. This is the best feeling ever I experienced,"" he gushed.Tilak credited India’s win to partnerships on a tricky batting pitch.""I agree with Surya bhai's statement of 'no rivalry' but this is sports and we knew that they will come prepared for the final.""We were expecting that and we were prepared when they took the pace off the ball and the pitch was also not easy to bat on. We made some good partnerships and won the match and are proud of that,” he noted.After managing a tense chase successfully, Tilak was compared to Virat Kohli, the original 'chase master', but the 22-year-old remained grounded.""It is always a matter of pride when you get spoken in the same breath as a legend like Virat bhai. But my focus is just winning the matches for the country,"" he said.Tilak now has his sights set on next year's T20 World Cup at home.""I am happy that I could make India win the Asia Cup. I started playing cricket after the 2011 World Cup. The (T20) World Cup is going to take place soon. That is my real aim. I will get sleep only after I win the World Cup,"" he added.He also expressed gratitude to his childhood coaches who shaped his early career.""Everyone knows my name now, everyone knows who Tilak Varma is. But when nobody knew me, my coaches were with me, backed me big time, and have helped me build and shape my career since I was a child.""Ups and downs are a part of the game. I started at Legala Cricket Academy, and whenever I practice here, I gain confidence. I know if I'm on this soil, I'll get confidence.""My coaches, Salam (Bayash) sir and Prithvi sir, are everything to me, and they've done a lot for me. Special thanks to the Hyderabad Cricket Association and the BCCI for giving me this opportunity,"" he signed off.After the Asia Cup final, Mohsin Naqvi, ignoring protocol and common sense, insisted on presenting the trophy himself. When India refused, he arrogantly ordered the trophy and medals removed from the stadium and stormed out, leaving players and fans in confusion and spoiling what should have been a celebratory moment.","Tilak Varma says winning the Asia Cup was the ""best reply"" to an aggressive opposition.

The Asia Cup 2025 concluded with controversy as India refused to receive their winners' trophy from PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi. Following India's boycott of the presentation ceremony, Naqvi reportedly departed with the trophy, leaving India to celebrate without it.Former Pakistani cricketer Basit Ali has expressed support for the PCB Chairman's actions while criticising India's decision to boycott the presentation.The situation unfolded when Team India chose not to participate in the trophy presentation, where Mohsin Naqvi, the Chairman of the Asian Cricket Council, was scheduled to present the awards.""They are the No. 1-ranked team, but their actions are third-rate. Mohsin Naqvi will present the trophy -- if they refuse to accept, they would be disgraced in the eyes of the world. The trophy should not be handed over,"" Ali told Pakistan's Arynews TV.The presentation ceremony was delayed by over an hour, and ultimately Team India did not receive the trophy. The team continued their celebrations without the trophy, appearing undeterred by the incident.India's captain addressed the situation during a post-match press conference, noting it was unprecedented for a winning team to be denied their trophy.He emphasized that being the deserving champions meant more to the team than the physical trophy.""You're the No.1 team, you played well and won, but what is this stubbornness? Mohsin Naqvi is the head of the Asian Cricket Council.

India to play their first home Test without Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma | A new era begins!

Poll Do you agree with Shubman Gill's approach to move away from spin-dominated pitches in Test matches? Yes, it's a great idea No, spin-friendly wickets are essential Unsure, need to see results

WORKLOAD MANAGEMENT QUESTIONS RAISED AGAIN

American businessman and the founder of Amazon once said, “If you’re not stubborn, you’ll give up on experiments too soon. And if you’re not flexible, you’ll pound your head against the wall and you won’t see a different solution to a problem you’re trying to solve. ”Indian Test captain Shubman Gill seems to be a believer in that philosophy. Without saying it in as many words, he gave enough indications that India decided to move away from their preference for rank turners, a nonnegotiable under previous captains like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , while playing Test matches at home.Playing on Bunsen burners like Indore, Pune and Mumbai resulted in ego-shattering losses and dwindling batting averages of star players, though it also helped the team conjure home wins to make two WTC finals.Speaking to the media before the first Test against West Indies, Gill, while admitting the team is juggling between the thoughts of playing a third seamer due to the grassy surface or sticking to the quality and potency that the four spinners in the fifteen offer, said, “I can’t really speak about what were the conversations before I came in as captain, but yes, we would be looking to play on wickets that offer help to both batters and bowlers.In short, what he meant was the team would like to play on truer surfaces that saw them compete marvellously in England in a famous 2-2 draw and a series in which Gill amassed 754 runs in five Tests, all of them lasting five days.Gill, though, feels that overseas teams should still be tested by spin and reverse swing, two attributes that are a given in red-ball cricket in India. But he wants the Tests to be more of an oldfashioned long read and not a quick story or reel posted on Instagram.“We are looking to play hard, grinding cricket. Over the past few years, Test matches in India haven’t really lasted for five days. What we are looking to do is to play some good hard cricket. All the Test matches that we played in England went pretty deep. We wouldn’t be looking for any easy options,” Gill stressed, his words echoing clarity, just like his plans while batting.That clarity seemed to have gone missing when he batted in the nets on Tuesday as he either edged or played and missed. His stint on Wednesday though was more serene and unhurried. His flow was better, the rhythm was there, and the defence was tight.What did he hope to achieve in the two net sessions to help him switch back to Test mode? “I was just looking to work on defence and trying to get in the zone. Switching formats is more mental than about technique.”Gill stressed, though, that adjusting from the longer formats to the shorter one is an easier switch.So, how does he do it? “I just try to get in the zone. That zone is nothing for me. Just watching the ball well and being able to decide the areas where I can defend and attack and showing the requisite patience to be able to stick to that process,” Gill said.India’s workload management policy surrounding Jasprit Bumrah sparked debate during the five-match Test series in England, where Bumrah had stated beforehand that he would only be able to play in three of the five games. Some even criticised the move.For a player who skipped Test matches and then played in the T20 Asia Cup, which many consider a low-hanging fruit, Bumrah’s management has triggered even more intrigue.Indian skipper Shubman Gill was asked if Bumrah would play both Tests against the West Indies. Gill’s answer was unspecific. “We’re going to take a call on a match-tomatch basis depending on how long a Test match goes on and how many overs our fast bowlers bowl,” he said.","Shubman Gill wants India to play 'hard, grinding cricket' in Test matches.

Former Pakistan cricket captain Shahid Afridi has urged Mohsin Naqvi to step down from one of his two positions - either as Pakistan Cricket Board chairman or as Minister of Interior.Afridi believes Pakistan cricket requires full attention, which Naqvi cannot provide while managing both roles simultaneously.Naqvi's tenure as PCB chairman since 2024 has been marked by challenges. Under his leadership, Pakistan has struggled in home Test matches, the 2025 Champions Trophy, and now in the Asia Cup.Despite improved performance under new coach Mike Hesson, the team's showing in the 2025 Asia Cup was mixed, with victories overshadowed by three losses against India.""My request or advice to Naqvi Saheb is that these are two very important posts, and they are big jobs that need time. PCB is totally different from the Interior Ministry, so it must be kept separate,"" Afridi told Telecom Asia Sport.""It would be a big decision and should be taken as soon as possible. Pakistan cricket needs special attention and time… Naqvi cannot rely totally on advisers. These advisers are taking him nowhere and he himself says that he doesn't know much about cricket. He needs to appoint good and competent advisers who know about the game.""Naqvi's responsibilities have expanded further with his appointment as chairman of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC). His leadership during the 2025 Asia Cup was marked by controversy, particularly regarding his interactions with India.The tournament's conclusion was notable for an incident during the trophy presentation. When India emerged victorious, they expressed reluctance to receive the trophy from Naqvi, citing his previous anti-India positions.In response, Naqvi left the stadium with the winners' trophy.“Indian media thrives on lies, not facts. Let me make it absolutely clear: I have done nothing wrong and I have never apologised to the BCCI nor will I ever do so,” Naqvi recently wrote in a post on X.“This fabricated nonsense is nothing but cheap propaganda, aimed only at misleading their own people. Unfortunately, India continues to drag politics into cricket, damaging the very spirit of the game.”These events have added to the growing pressure on Naqvi, who continues to balance his multiple roles in Pakistani cricket administration and government.

India’s Handshake Snub at Asia Cup Leaves Pakistan in Full Meltdown, ICC Dragged Into Drama

Poll Who do you think will win the upcoming match between India and Pakistan in the Women's ODI World Cup? India Pakistan

The upcoming Women's ODI World Cup 2025 will feature a match between India and Pakistan on Sunday in Colombo. This follows recent events at the Asia Cup 2025, where three India-Pakistan matches generated significant attention.The Indian men's cricket team declined handshakes with Pakistani players and refused to accept the trophy from Asian Cricket Council chief Mohsin Naqvi after winning the final.Indian men's team captain Suryakumar Yadav set this precedent, and now attention turns to how Indian women's team captain Harmanpreet Kaur will handle the situation.BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia addressed questions about whether the Indian women's team would follow the men's team's approach.""I cannot forecast anything, but our relationship with that particular hostile country is the same; there is no change in the last week,"" Saikia told BBC Stumped.""India will play that match against Pakistan in Colombo, and all cricket protocols will be followed. I can only assure that whatever is in the MCC regulations of cricket, that will be done. Whether there will be handshakes, whether there will be hugging, I cannot assure you of anything at this moment.""In recent Women's World Cup action, Bangladesh defeated Pakistan by seven wickets with 18.5 overs remaining in Colombo. Bangladesh successfully chased Pakistan's total of 129.Rubya Haider, making her WODI debut, scored an unbeaten half-century to guide Bangladesh to victory. The Bangladesh bowling attack, led by Marufa Akter, set the tone with early wickets.""We are thrilled to get a win under our belt in our first outing,"" said Marufa. ""There was lot of support from my team-mates. Special credit to our team analyst who fed me with some valuable input leading into the game. We showed lot of energy on the field and we take lot of positives from this game.""Bangladesh's spin bowlers dominated the match. Nahida Akter claimed two quick wickets, reducing Pakistan to 47-4 in 14 overs. Shorna Akter then took three wickets for just five runs in 3.3 overs.Rubya Haider's batting performance featured precise cut shots between point and cover. She maintained control throughout the innings without needing to play aerial shots.Pakistan's batting performance was underwhelming, with only two players scoring more than 20 runs. They face the challenge of adapting to Colombo's slow pitch conditions for their upcoming matches.Diana Baig, who represents Pakistan in both cricket and football, showed promise with her bowling. However, the low target meant her efforts couldn't change the match outcome.""We just lost too many wickets early on and never recovered,"" Pakistan captain Fatima Sana said.

Scorecard:

Poll Which player do you think was the standout performer for Bangladesh? Rubya Haider Marufa Akter Nahida Akter

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh produced a commanding performance to hand Pakistan a crushing seven-wicket defeat in their ICC Women’s World Cup 2025 opener on Thursday. A composed half-century from Rubya Haider, combined with her match-winning partnership with skipper Nigar Sultana , powered the visitors to an emphatic victory at Colombo.Chasing a below-par 130, Bangladesh initially struggled, losing early wickets as Fargana Hoque and Sharmin Akhter fell cheaply. At 23 for 1 after 10 overs, the chase appeared tricky.However, Rubya Haider, 28, played with measured caution before launching into a flurry of boundaries to take control. Her 77-ball unbeaten 54, featuring eight fours, was complemented by a patient 62-run stand with Nigar Sultana (23 off 44 balls) for the third wicket, taking Bangladesh to 131 for 3 in just 31.1 overs with 113 balls to spare.Bangladesh’s victory was built on disciplined bowling, with teenage pacer Marufa Akter leading the charge. The 20-year-old right-arm pacer dismantled Pakistan’s top order, dismissing Omaima Sohail and Sidra Amin for first-ball ducks in the opening over, reducing Pakistan to 2/2.Veteran spinner Nahida Akter (2/19) compounded the damage, sending back Muneeba Ali (17) and Rameen Shamim (23) shortly after the powerplay, leaving Pakistan reeling at 47/4.The lower order offered little resistance, with Shorna Akter (3/5) finishing the innings as Pakistan were bowled out for 129 in 38.3 overs, unable to maintain a run rate above four. Pakistan’s innings featured just 14 boundaries, reflecting the disciplined line and length executed by Bangladesh bowlers throughout.Rubya’s counter-attacking innings, combined with Bangladesh’s clinical bowling and smart field placements, ensured that Pakistan never recovered from the early shocks. The win sets a dominant tone for Bangladesh in the tournament, highlighting their depth in both batting and bowling against a fragile Pakistan side.","Bangladesh beat Pakistan by seven wickets in their ICC Women's World Cup 2025 opener on Thursday.

IND vs ENG: Mohammed Siraj reflects on memorable win at The Oval

Poll What do you think is the key to Siraj’s impressive bowling performance? Wicket Conditions Personal Skill and Hard Work Team Strategy

NEW DELHI: Star India pacer Mohammed Siraj once again underlined his growing stature in Test cricket with a devastating spell that left the West Indies reeling on the opening day of the first Test on Thursday. Siraj’s four-wicket haul (4/40) dismantled the hosts for 162 in just 44.1 overs, before India replied strongly to close at 121 for 2, trailing by just 41 runs.The day belonged to Siraj, who admitted that the chance to bowl on a green-top surface brought out the best in him. “I was very excited to bowl on this green-top wicket, something we don’t get very often in India. The last time we had such a wicket was against New Zealand in Bengaluru,” he said after stumps.Siraj set the tone early, striking thrice in the morning session with his trademark wobble seam deliveries. The standout dismissal came when he sent Brandon King ’s middle stump flying after the batter shouldered arms. “I was able to execute it the way I had planned. Two balls before, he was hit on the pads, and I thought about bowling in the line of the stumps. It worked exactly as I wanted,” Siraj explained.He also removed West Indies skipper Roston Chase with an angled ball that surprised even him. “With the wobble seam, the ball either comes in or cuts out.But that delivery kept straightening from the shiny side while I had bowled it with wobble seam,” Siraj said with a smile.Reflecting on his performance, the Hyderabad pacer highlighted how confidence from India’s hard-fought 2-2 series draw in England earlier this year carried over into this match. “It was a very competitive series in England, and I got a lot of confidence from it. To perform against a strong side gives a different kind of confidence and I felt it today as well,” he said.Siraj admitted the wickets didn’t come easy. “I had to work hard for these four wickets as well. Even in England, I had to work hard. It’s not the case that you can get wickets just like that. No one gave me the fifth wicket (today), I had to take all four with hard work,” he declared, summing up his relentless effort.","Mohammed Siraj takes four wickets on opening day of first Test.

Women's World Cup prediction: Greenstone Lobo explains which team has best chance to win

WATCH:

NEW DELHI: The Women’s World Cup 2025 was rocked by controversy on Thursday after former Pakistan captain Sana Mir, part of the commentary panel, sparked outrage with an on-air remark referencing “Azad Kashmir. ” The comment, made during Pakistan’s opening match against Bangladesh, has triggered a massive backlash on social media and drawn attention from cricket fans and authorities alike.In a widely circulated clip, Mir was heard saying: “... captaining a very young side. Yes, they have won the qualifiers, but a lot of these players are new. Natalia who comes from Kashmir, Azad Kashmir, plays in Lahore a lot of cricket. She has to come to Lahore to play most of her cricket there.”Indian fans quickly reacted, tagging the ICC and BCCI , demanding action and calling for her removal from the commentary panel for mixing politics with sport. The ICC has strict rules against politicising cricket, and the incident has reignited debates about commentators maintaining neutrality on international broadcasts.The controversy overshadowed Pakistan’s performance on the field, where they struggled against Bangladesh’s disciplined bowling attack.Bangladesh restricted Pakistan to a below-par 129 all out in 38.3 overs on a docile track.Bangladesh pacer Marufa Akter, 20, delivered a stunning opening spell, dismissing opener Omaima Sohail and stalwart Sidra Amin for first-ball ducks, leaving Pakistan reeling at 2/2. Slow left-arm spinner Nahida Akter added to the pressure, removing Muneeba Ali (17) and Rameen Shamim (23) shortly after the powerplay, ensuring Pakistan’s innings never gained momentum.Pakistan’s run rate rarely crossed four runs per over, and the team crossed 100 only in the 30th over, managing just 14 boundaries in total. Their batters struggled to adapt to Bangladesh’s smart rotation of bowlers, and wickets fell at regular intervals.","Former Pakistan captain Sana Mir sparked outrage with an on-air remark referencing “Azad Kashmir. ” The comment, made during Pakistan’s opening match against Bangladesh, has triggered a massive backlash on social media and drawn attention from cricket fans and authorities alike.

ADKR Squad:

The ILT20 Season 4 player auction in Dubai on October 1, 2025, was full of drama, surprises and record-breaking deals as franchises shaped their squads for the six-team tournament, which will run from December 2, 2025, to January 4, 2026. Among them, Abu Dhabi Knight Riders (ADKR) — who are still chasing their maiden title — made several interesting signings as they look to bounce back from another disappointing season.Since the league’s inception, Abu Dhabi Knight Riders have struggled for consistency. They finished bottom of the table in 2023 and 2025, while their best result came in 2024 when they reached the playoffs. Determined to change their fortunes in 2026, the franchise has built a strong blend of global superstars, experienced campaigners, and exciting new talent.ADKR’s batting unit promises fireworks this season.English stars Alex Hales and Liam Livingstone will headline the top order with their explosive strokeplay, while Caribbean power-hitter Andre Russell adds immense firepower in the middle overs. Phil Salt, known for his attacking starts in T20 cricket, and Sherfane Rutherford, another hard-hitter, will offer depth.The addition of Scotland’s Brandon McMullen (USD 110,000) is a key signing — his all-round ability and recent form have made him one of the most sought-after associate players.Domestic talents like Unmukt Chand and Michael Pepper will provide stability and flexibility to the batting line-up.The experienced Sunil Narine will continue to be the backbone of ADKR’s spin attack while also contributing as a pinch-hitting opener if required. Pace options include Olly Stone and George Garton, who bring pace and control, while Khary Pierre and Ibrar Ahmed bolster the spin department. Emerging players like Ajay Kumar, Adnan Idrees, and Alishan Sharafu add valuable bench strength.With a well-rounded squad featuring match-winners across departments, Abu Dhabi Knight Riders will aim to turn potential into performance and challenge for their first ILT20 title this season.Brandon McMullen, Michael Pepper, Unmukt Chand, Ibrar Ahmed, Ajay Kumar, Adnan Idrees, Abdul Manan Ali, Mayank Chowdary, Khary Pierre, Shadley Van Schalkwyk, George Garton, Liam Livingstone, Alex Hales, Sherfane Rutherford, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Phil Salt, Olly Stone, Alishan Sharafu.","The ILT20 Season 4 player auction in Dubai on October 1, 2025, was full of drama, surprises and record-breaking deals.

WATCH:

Poll Is the performance of the Bangladesh bowlers a sign of their future potential in women's cricket? Absolutely, they showed great skill. Not necessarily, they had a good day.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan batter Nashra Sandhu became just the second player in Women's World Cup history to be dismissed hit wicket, in a bizarre turn of events during their opening match against Bangladesh on Thursday. The first instance occurred 52 years ago when Lynette Smith, playing for International XI Women, fell victim to the unusual mode of dismissal.Sandhu managed just 1 run before her unusual exit off the bowling of Shorna Akter in the 35th over, with video clips of the incident quickly going viral across social media.The dismissal was part of a disciplined bowling display by Bangladesh, led by young pacer Marufa Akter and veteran spinner Nahida Akter, which restricted Pakistan to a below-par 129 all out in 38.3 overs on a docile batting track at the ICC Women’s World Cup.Bangladesh’s 20-year-old pacer Marufa Akter provided the early jolt, dismissing opener Omaima Sohail and experienced batter Sidra Amin for first-ball ducks, leaving Pakistan reeling at 2/2.

The team never managed to accelerate, touching 100 only in the 30th over, and ended with just 14 boundaries, only four of which came during the powerplay. Bangladesh’s tactical bowling rotation kept Pakistan guessing throughout the innings, highlighting both the skill of the bowlers and the batting side’s struggle to adapt.","Pakistan batter Nashra Sandhu becomes just the second player in Women's World Cup history to be dismissed hit wicket.

SIRAJ AND BUMRAH'S BOWLING MASTERCLASS

RAHUL STANDS FIRM

INDIA ON TOP

NEW DELHI: India took firm control of the opening day of the first Test against West Indies on Thursday, thanks to a brilliant bowling display led by Mohammed Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah followed by a composed half-century from KL Rahul After bowling out the visitors for just 162, India finished the day at 121/2, trailing by 41 runs with eight wickets in hand.The day began with West Indies opting to bat first, but their decision quickly backfired as Siraj and Bumrah tore through the batting line-up. Siraj (4/40) was the pick of the bowlers, striking three times in a fiery first spell and adding another wicket after lunch. Bumrah (3/32) complemented him perfectly, using his pace and precision to dismantle the middle order.The Caribbean side never found momentum. Justin Greaves (32), Shai Hope (26), and Roston Chase (24) offered brief resistance, but none could build a substantial innings. Kuldeep Yadav (2/25) and Washington Sundar (1/9) chipped in with crucial wickets as West Indies were bundled out in just 44.1 overs.In response, Indian openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul gave the hosts a steady start. Jaiswal initially took a patient approach, scoring just 4 off his first 36 balls before unleashing a flurry of boundaries.He raced to 36 off 54 balls but fell trying to cut a ball too close to his body, edging behind off Jayden Seales.Sai Sudharsan’s stay was short-lived. After narrowly avoiding a run-out mix-up with Rahul, he misjudged a pull shot against Roston Chase and was trapped lbw for 7.Rahul, however, remained calm and composed throughout. Battling through some early movement with the new ball, he reached his 20th Test fifty, finishing the day unbeaten on 53 off 114 deliveries with six boundaries. Skipper Shubman Gill supported him with a cautious 18 not out as India maintained control.The West Indies bowlers showed glimpses of promise, especially Seales, who troubled the Indian top order with bounce and movement. But debutant Johann Layne struggled with his line and length, easing pressure on the batters.With just 41 runs separating them from West Indies’ total and eight wickets still in hand, India are well-placed to seize a significant first-innings lead on Day 2. If Rahul and Gill can extend their partnership and the middle order fires, the hosts will aim to bat West Indies out of the contest early in this two-Test series.","Mohammed Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah took four wickets each.

India to play their first home Test without Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma | A new era begins!

Poll Do you think Shubman Gill made the right choice in sticking with an extra all-rounder for the home Tests? Yes, it adds depth to the team No, they should play more specialist bowlers Unsure, depends on the match conditions

India lost another toss, made short work of the West Indies batting order, Mohammed Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah were amongst the wickets but all that was of little significance in Ahmedabad on Thursday. Shubman Gill walked out wearing the captain's blazer for the first time on home soil and carried the A4 sized sheet - mentioning the Playing XI and reserves - which carried a lot of significance to the toss. The flip didn't go India's way again but again, that didn't really matter.All that mattered were the names in the XI. For a side which was on a hunt for an ideal XI during the five Tests in England, the upcoming home season presented an opportunity to persist after regular movements in search of the right balance. Extra bowler? Extra batter? or extra all-rounder? The three questions kept popping up every time India took the field in England but the management chose batting depth over a specialist bowler. It made England a long summer on the bench for Kuldeep Yadav but the think tank was convinced that they needed depth, and trusted the likes of Washington Sundar and Nitish Kumar Reddy to do the job with the ball.The calls for Kuldeep's inclusion kept getting louder after every session of ""what could have been"" but captain Shubman Gill and coach Gautam Gambhir had devised a strategy, and stuck to it. The interest around an India Playing XI returned for the home Tests vs West Indies and it wasn't for the individuals who could make/miss the cut but for the direction they were looking in for the home season.The four Tests - two vs West Indies and two vs South Africa - have crucial World Test Championship cycle points up for grabs but more than those additions to the tally, it was about finding a template which works, with minute touches here and there, both home and away, and then sticking to it. Gill has time and again repeated about creating a secure environment and a confused approach only feeds insecurity.So quite naturally, there was a lot of interest when Gill was asked about the playing combination. ""We have two seamers - Bumrah and Siraj, three spinners - Jaddu Bhai, Washington and Kuldeep, and allrounder Nitish Reddy,"" came his crisp response. The template in England - all-rounders who contribute with both bat and ball - was persisted with and the minute change here was the extra seamer making way for Kuldeep because of the home conditions.There would have been the temptation to play the extra quick on the greenish surface but refreshingly, there was no confusion, no complication. Straight message that the days of playing five specialist bowlers and backing your top five to do bulk of the scoring are behind us and a reminder that Gill's XI will continue to enjoy depth, and have six bowling options. Even if they are four specialists and two all-rounders, it's something which they were not comfortable doing away with, and look set to give a fair run at home.There are no doubts about the superiority India are going to enjoy over West Indies in Ahmedabad and Delhi, but again, it was never about the results, runs, wickets or who steals the spotlight on a day, but how Gill and Gambhir were going to shape the Test XI.",India lost the toss in the second Test against West Indies in Ahmedabad. Captain Shubman Gill chose to stick with an extra all-rounder for the home Tests.

A new chapter in football history is unfolding as Luca Zidane, son of French legend Zinedine Zidane , received his first call-up to the Algerian national team on Thursday. The 27-year-old goalkeeper, who previously represented France at youth levels, is now eligible to play for Algeria through his father’s family heritage, marking a significant “change of an era” in the Zidane legacy.FIFA officially approved Zidane’s switch in national allegiance just two weeks ago, clearing the way for him to represent the North African nation. Currently playing for Spanish second-division side Granada, Luca’s call-up comes at a critical juncture, with Algeria on the cusp of qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America.Algeria coach Vladimir Petkovic included Zidane in his 26-player squad for upcoming qualifying fixtures against Somalia on October 9 and Uganda on October 14. The Desert Foxes lead their group by four points, and a victory in either match would secure their spot in the tournament co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico.The Zidane name is already etched in World Cup history. Zinedine Zidane played in three editions for France, lifting the trophy in 1998 and experiencing heartbreak in 2006 after his infamous headbutt in the final against Italy. Now, Luca has the opportunity to make his mark on the international stage and continue his father’s storied legacy — this time with Algeria.With the 2026 World Cup approaching, Luca Zidane’s debut signals not just a personal milestone but a symbolic shift in football heritage.",Luca Zidane received his first call-up to the Algerian national team on Thursday.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything.

You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

Why Rohit Sharma got really emotional at a promotional event

JAIPUR: Call it the sport’s multiplier effect. Following Rohit Sharma ’s entertaining batting display against Sikkim on Wednesday, the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) officials are bracing themselves for another surge, this time greater, of fans when the star studded Mumbai play their second Vijay Hazare Trophy match at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium here on Friday.It will be Blockbuster Friday should Rohit continue his magical batting show against Uttarakhand.On Wednesday, around 20,000 spectators showed up and enjoyed the match as Rohit unleashed his wide range of strokes to hammer a 94-ball 155 runs as Mumbai cruised to an eight-wicket win over the minnows.With Christmas holidays on, the organisers are expecting more spectators Friday.“We are opening two more stands in the north block as we are expecting more cricket lovers on Friday. There were at least two-three thousand fans waiting outside on Wednesday as the stands we opened were absolutely packed. We will make all possible efforts so that more people can watch the Mumbai match tomorrow. It will be free entry for all the spectators,” RCA ad-hoc committee convener DD Kumawat told TOI on Thursday.Uttarakhand, who lost to Himachal Pradesh in their opening match on Wednesday, also had a practice session on Thursday.The Mumbai team, meanwhile, had an optional practice session on Thursday and only eight players turned up at the RCA Academy ground in the afternoon session.Most of the senior players including Rohit and captain Shardul Thakur opted to rest.The Khan brothers — Sarfaraz and Musheer — had a long batting session in the nets. Upcoming batter Suryansh Shedge and experienced left-arm spinner Shams Mulani sweated it out in the nets. Those players who did not get a chance to play against Sikkim showed up at the optional practice along with the support staff. After nets, all of them went through fielding drills and catching sessions.Some of the die-hard fans also turned up at the RCA Academy ground hoping to get a glimpse of Rohit but they were disappointed as the star did not come to the venue. “We are obviously disappointed not to see him today at the practice but we will be surely coming to see the match tomorrow and hoping to get full entertainment from Rohit’s batting display,” said some of the fans on Thursday.","Mumbai play second Vijay Hazare Trophy match at Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Friday.

On the eve of the World Rapid & Blitz Chess Championships, top-ranked Magnus Carlsen and world classical chess champion Gukesh Dommaraju had a face off of a slightly different nature in Doha, Qatar, on Thursday.Mind games prevailed when both Carlsen and Gukesh addressed a joint media conference, ahead of the tournament where a total of 254 players in the open and 142 women participants, will vie for honours over five days. Four world titles will be on offer.With reigning Women’s World Champ Ju Wenjun, FIDE boss Arkady Dvorkovich, and president of Qatar Chess Mohd Al-Mudahka for company on the dias, Gukesh was modesty personified when he said he “doesn’t have much expectation and his aim is to have some fun while experimenting with various tricks.” In reply, Carlsen thundered, “I am here to win.”Replying to a query on his sense of responsibility to perform across all formats, Gukesh said, “For me, playing well in any format is quite important. I took rapid and blitz a bit more seriously this year. Although the shorter formats have less priority than classical events for me. So in this event, I don’t have a lot of expectations. I am here to play, just experiment, enjoy playing chess.”Carlsen will be playing for the world title after becoming a first-time parent. On his approach, the world No.1 Carlsen across all formats said, “I love being a husband and a father. It’s been a fantastic experience this year. As for now, neither my wife nor my son are too much of a help, unfortunately, in terms of chess advice yet. So, it really hasn’t changed much, and I’m here to win, as always.”When both champions were asked how kids could be a threat to them in Doha, Gukesh said, “Youngsters are capable of playing at a high level,” and Carlsen feels Gukesh is ‘still a youngster.’Carlsen said, “It’s not only the generation between 22 and 16 years old, it’s even younger players who have developed tremendously in a short time.”","World No.1 Magnus Carlsen and world classical chess champion Gukesh Dommaraju had a face off in Doha, Qatar, on Thursday.

MUMBAI: India’s ODI vice-captain Shreyas Iyer had his first batting session on Wednesday and is now headed to the BCCI Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru, where he will “undergo further sessions in the nets,” TOI has learnt.Iyer last featured in the ODI series against Australia in Oct, where he suffered a severe spleen injury to his abdomen during the third and final match in Sydney, which resulted in his hospitalisation. The injury forced the 31-year-old batter to miss the home ODI series against South Africa, followed by the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and the Vijay Hazare Trophy tournaments for Mumbai.“He has resumed batting in the nets as per the CoE guidelines. He will undergo further sessions,” a source saidThere is now a touch-and-go chance that Iyer may return to action for Mumbai in the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy, and subsequently in the three-match home ODI series against New Zealand, which begins on January 11 in Vadodara.Meanwhile, it is learnt that India’s Test and ODI opener Yashasvi Jaiswal will join the Mumbai team in Jaipur for the Vijay Hazare Trophy on December 29.","India’s ODI vice-captain Shreyas Iyer had his first batting session on Wednesday.

BENGALURU:

Virat Kohli's childhood coach makes a big statement on 2027 ODI World Cup

Before Wednesday, Virat Kohli ’s last appearance in the Vijay Hazare Trophy dated back to Feb 2010. Fifteen years on, as Delhi prepare for their second outing here, the question that lingers is: Could this be Kohli’s final brush with the domestic 50-over tournament?Kohli’s presence in domestic cricket has become a rarity, almost an event in itself. With the former India captain having already stepped away from Tests and T20Is, the prospect of him returning for another Vijay Hazare season seems distant. That rarity has lent the ongoing edition an air of anticipation, with star power drawing attention across centres hosting the league fixtures.In Bengaluru, the anticipation was palpable. Fans had hoped to catch Kohli at the familiar confines of the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. Instead, seven Group D matches were shifted to the BCCI Centre of Excellence on the city’s outskirts after the stadium was denied permission. Devoid of spectator facilities, the venue was hardly designed for a Kohli appearance — yet that did little to dull the frenzy.On a crisp winter afternoon against Andhra, the match unfolded like an open-air spectacle. With no stands to sit in, fans climbed atop carrier trucks, perched on trees and leaned over compound walls, united by a single pursuit: a glimpse of Kohli in action.Nearby, U-19 players undergoing match simulation paused often, drawn by the magnetism unfolding next door.Kohli, in turn, made the wait worthwhile. He spent most of Andhra’s innings patrolling the field, stepping away only briefly, before settling in for a long stay at the crease. For nearly 33 overs, he stitched together a fluent 131 off 101 balls — a knock that blended authority with effortlessness, and purpose with poise.The frenzy shows no signs of easing. On Friday, when Delhi take on a Chintan Gaja-led Gujarat, Kohli will once again be the axis around which the contest will revolve. Among the few subplots, his duel with leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi stands out. The 25-year-old, still seeking to carve a longer white-ball career after a solitary ODI appearance in Oct 2022, is looking to make a statement.","Virat Kohli's last appearance in the Vijay Hazare Trophy dated back to Feb 2010.

India received some positive news ahead of the third T20I against Sri Lanka, with off-spin all-rounder Deepti Sharma declared fit and available for selection. India head coach Amol Muzumdar confirmed the update on the eve of the match on Thursday.Deepti had missed the second T20I in Visakhapatnam after suffering from a mild fever. The Indian team management decided not to take any risk, and the BCCI medical team closely monitored her recovery. India went on to win that match by seven wickets and now lead the five-match series 2-0.Speaking at the pre-match press conference, Muzumdar assured that Deepti is fully fit and ready to play. “Deepti is absolutely fine. She's available and fit,” he said.Muzumdar also spoke about pacer Renuka Singh Thakur, who has not played in the first two matches of the series. He explained that her absence was due to the team trying out different combinations and not because of any injury concerns. “For Renuka, again, we were looking at a different combination. Also trying out a few things, and she's an integral part of this team, as you've known in the last two years.It's just about trying out a few things within the group,” Muzumdar said.The coach also shared an update on Jemimah Rodrigues, who has been in good form in the series so far. Jemimah scored an unbeaten 69 in the first T20I and followed it up with a 26 in the second match at Visakhapatnam. However, she did not take part in the practice session ahead of the third T20I.Muzumdar clarified that Jemimah missed practice only as a precaution. He said she had a small issue but is doing well and was given rest to avoid any risk. “Jemimah had a little bit of an issue, but I think she's fine. She's just resting today. The doctors and the physios are having a close look at her, monitoring her consistently. She should be fine. It's just a mandatory rest that she wants,” he explained.When asked about the team combination for the third T20I, Muzumdar said the final decision on the playing XI will be taken on match day. “We'll decide the playing XI on the morning of the game,” he said.With key players fit and available, India will look to continue their strong run in the series and aim to seal an unassailable lead against Sri Lanka.",Deepti Sharma declared fit and available for selection for third T20I against Sri Lanka.

In fact, there is a fourth one now, which is fitness. Nothing in particular about one facet of the game.""We are a progressive side, constantly we are trying to improve day by day,"" he said.The coach said his wards are currently basking in the afterglow of the ODI World Cup win.""I haven't seen any changes in the last 45 days. Whatever it is, it's a pleasant change. They seemed to be more happy on the ground. It's a good place to be in.""The tag they will always carry that now and they are well equipped to carry that tag. Whatever I saw in the first two games it was a fantastic effort,"" Muzumdar said.He, however, warned his team never to underestimate Sri Lanka.""Sri Lanka is a very good side, there is no doubt about it. Every opponent we look at it as a challenge. We have got some fantastic players but every opponent we do treat them with equal respect.""Muzumdar said he hasn't decided the playing XI as yet and will take a call on Friday morning.""It's not about challenges, it's about identifying and knowing the conditions.

India T20 World Cup squad: In search of ideal combination, Agarkar & Co. drop Shubman Gill

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Two matches, two emphatic statements. India have launched the T20I series against Sri Lanka in ruthless fashion, underlining a gulf that currently appears wider than the Palk Strait. Dominant with bat and ball, sharp in the field and unwavering in intent, the hosts have dictated terms from the very first over.Early wickets from a disciplined bowling attack have consistently derailed Sri Lanka’s innings, forcing the visitors into damage-control mode rather than allowing them to attack. Those incisive strikes have set up modest targets, which India’s batters have chased with a near-zen calm.India will take the field at the Greenfield Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram on Friday with a familiar objective and a growing sense of authority: to close out the five-match series. The fact that this is the first time that the venue will be hosting an international women’s fixture adds an extra layer of intrigue.Yet, this contest is about more than immediate results.At the pre-match press conference, head coach Amol Muzumdar made it clear that the larger picture remains firmly in focus, with the 2026 Women’s T20 World Cup shaping every decision.“Six months down the line, we have a T20 World Cup, so we are well aware of the areas we need to improve and the direction we need to take this side,” he asserted.He noted that maintaining consistency after being crowned ODI world champions earlier this year has been encouraging. With two more series scheduled before the global event, this phase is being used to identify areas that need fine-tuning.Muzumdar also warned against complacency despite India’s early dominance. “Although we’ve won the first two matches, Sri Lanka cannot be taken lightly,” he argued.India have begun rotating their squad and testing bench strength, giving younger players opportunities while keeping the core intact. One such player, Vaishnavi Sharma, has already made an impression, returning figures of 2/32 in the second match.“She did exactly what was asked of her. Credit to her that her exploits in the U-19 games were rewarded,” Muzumdar said.He credited the depth and competitiveness of domestic cricket for easing selection calls and highlighted the team’s daily push to improve across all aspects of the game.All-rounder Deepti Sharma , who missed the second game in Visakhapatnam due to fever, is poised to return, while Jemimah Rodrigues was eased out of training on Thursday due to minor health concerns.For Sri Lanka, the challenge remains steep. A faltering middle order has failed to build on starts, and below-par totals have left their bowlers with little margin for error.For India, Thiruvananthapuram offers more than a chance to seal a 5–0 sweep. It is another opportunity to further refine a well-oiled T20 unit that continues to set the benchmark at home.",India take on Sri Lanka in the fifth and final T20 in Thiruvananthapuram on Friday.

He smashed a brilliant 63 runs from only 25 balls and reached his half-century in just 16 deliveries.This became the second-fastest T20I fifty by an Indian, behind only Yuvraj Singh’s famous effort in 2007.His explosive batting helped India score 231 for 5 and seal a convincing 3-1 series victory.","Hardik Pandya was leaving a restaurant after celebrating Christmas with his girlfriend, Maheika Sharma.

As Christmas celebrations wind down, cricket ignites at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. England’s Ashes dream may be over, but the visitors are playing for pride and redemption. With a commanding 3–0 lead, Australia look to further tighten their grip on the series in the 4th Test.With the match falling on December 26, attention turns to Boxing Day — a date steeped in history, tradition and sporting significance in Australia.Boxing Day is observed on December 26, the day after Christmas, in the United Kingdom and several Commonwealth nations including Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa.The origins of the name are debated. One widely accepted explanation links it to alms boxes kept in churches, which were opened after Christmas to distribute donations to the poor. Another theory traces it to the Victorian-era tradition of employers giving servants and workers “Christmas boxes” — gifts, bonuses or leftover food — on the day after Christmas, along with a day off.Boxing Day also coincides with the Feast of St Stephen, the first Christian martyr, a day traditionally associated with charity and giving.Over time, the day has evolved into a mix of extended Christmas celebrations, charity, shopping sales and, crucially for sports fans, major sporting events.In the Southern Hemisphere, December falls in the middle of summer, making it ideal for outdoor sport. Australia embraced Boxing Day as a marquee sporting occasion, and cricket became its centrepiece.The Boxing Day Test is played annually at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, one of the largest and most historic stadiums in world sport. The tradition began in 1950, when Australia hosted England in a Test match starting on December 26. Since then, the fixture has become a permanent feature of the international cricket calendar.Crowds exceeding 60,000 on this day are common, and the match has produced some of Test cricket’s most memorable moments.India, too, has featured regularly in Boxing Day Tests in Australia, playing at the MCG on multiple tours since the 1980s. Over the years, the ground has witnessed historic performances, including debutant breakthroughs, marathon innings and series-defining spells.While Australia is most closely associated with the Boxing Day Test, similar matches are also played in South Africa and New Zealand when touring schedules allow, though none carry the scale or tradition of Melbourne’s showpiece.Globally, Boxing Day is now marked by:Yet in Australia, nothing quite matches the sight of the MCG packed to the rafters on December 26.","Boxing Day is observed on December 26, the day after Christmas, in the United Kingdom and several Commonwealth nations including Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa.

RABAT: Organisers at the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco are allowing supporters in for free after kick-off in matches where stadiums are not full, a Confederation of African Football source told AFP.The Group F game between Cameroon and Gabon on Wednesday in Agadir kicked off in front of almost empty stands but the ground filled up significantly over the course of the first half despite incessant rain.The official attendance was later announced as 35,200 inside a venue which can hold over 45,000.There have been similar scenes at numerous matches across the opening days of the competition, even leading to confusion over the attendance figures themselves.The crowd at Tuesday's Group D encounter between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Benin at Rabat's Al Medina Stadium -- which filled up considerably over the course of the game -- was initially announced as 6,703 before later being corrected to 13,073.The CAF source indicated that organisers, in agreement with African football's governing body, were opening stands around 20 minutes into games to allow fans gathered outside to enter without paying.Filling stadiums is an important issue for Cup of Nations organisers in Morocco, for which a successful hosting of the tournament is key as it builds towards the 2030 World Cup to be jointly held in the North African country, Spain and Portugal.CAF's official ticketing platform on Thursday showed seats available for almost all remaining group matches for prices starting at 100 dirhams ($10.96).The only matches shown as sell-outs were hosts Morocco's games against Mali on Friday and Zambia on Monday, as well as Algeria against Burkina Faso on Sunday and Algeria versus Equatorial Guinea next Wednesday.","Africa Cup of Nations organisers are allowing supporters in for free after kick- off in matches where stadiums are not full.

Where did it all go wrong for Indian football?

FC Goa players made a strong statement during their AFC Champions League 2 match against FC Istiklol by staging a silent protest before kick-off on Wednesday at the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium.As the referee blew the whistle for kick-off, the FC Goa players staged the pre-planned protest and did not play for a few seconds.The protest was aimed at highlighting the “deepening uncertainty” that is affecting the Indian football ecosystem.Issues related to administration and commercial matters have caused major delays around top-tier domestic football competitions like the Indian Super League and the I-League.Players, coaches, and staff across clubs are feeling the impact of this situation.Soon after the incident, FC Goa released a statement on social media to explain their action.“This action was solely intended to draw attention to the broader challenges facing the domestic football ecosystem,” the club said in an official statement.FC Goa also made it clear that the protest was not against their opponents or the Asian Football Confederation.Instead, it was meant to show the frustration and concern felt by those involved in Indian football, who are unsure about the future of the game in the country.On the field, FC Goa started well despite the tense backdrop. The home team took the lead in the eighth minute when Dejan Drazic found space inside the box and scored with a fine curling shot into the top corner.In the second half, Istiklol made a strong comeback.

Lionel Messi India trip: Mumbai out in numbers for the superstar





No takers for game





Court hearings, President's appeal, sports ministry intervention





Women and juniors shine

NEW DELHI: Indian football remained in a state of terminal decline after experiencing arguably its darkest phase in a year marked by severe administrative crisis, court hearings, financial issues, absence of domestic leagues, and a steep decline in performance of the senior men's team.As the year drew to a close, the high-profile Lionel Messi GOAT India Tour generated some interest and forced a conversation around the sport.The much-publicised event did what it was meant to, and was not supposed to serve as a catalyst for real improvement in Indian football.If its own problems were not enough, the chaos and absolute disorder at Salt Lake Stadium on the first day of the Messi tour added to the embarrassment.While the breakdown of law and order in the 'Mecca of Indian football' was not good advertisement, the remaining three legs in Hyderabad, Mumbai and Delhi were well organised.Of the many disappointments, one on-field moment that still stings came when little-known Bangladeshi midfielder Sheikh Morsalin darted into the box and slipped the ball between the legs of Gurpreet Singh Sandhu with a delicate touch, completing another round of humiliation.The 11th minute strike, in an inconsequential 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifying match on a November evening in Dhaka, meant the Indian senior men's team suffered its first defeat to Bangladesh in 22 years, after having struggled through the last 12 months to produce a result of any significance.While several factors contribute to a country's overall football ecosystem, globally the senior team's performance is often the most visible metric, and India was found severely wanting on that front.Unlike in 2024, when the team drew a blank in international matches, the Indian senior men's side did manage to churn out a few wins occasionally this year, including a bronze medal finish at the CAFA Nations Cup in the central Asian countries of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in September.But, in the matches that mattered the most, India failed to deliver and could not qualify for the Asian Cup for the first time since the 2011 edition, following which the team plummeted further in the FIFA rankings.Besides Bangladesh, the team also suffered defeats to other lower-ranked opponents such as Hong Kong and Singapore, a 1-2 loss to whom dashed its hopes of entering the Asian Cup following a disappointing campaign in the Qualifications.While the men's team struggled on the field, especially when it came to scoring goals, the administrators grappled with issues off it.The game remained in the middle of a crisis due to the All India Football Federation's failure to secure a new commercial partner for the Indian Super League after its previous contract with the Reliance-owned Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) expired on December 8.On expected lines, the lack of a commercial partner has had a crippling effect on the game. The ISL, which would have been into its third month now under normal circumstances, remains on hold.The sponsors are pulling out, clubs have put their operations on hold, players are staring at an uncertain future, after having implored each and every stakeholder to resolve the issue, and serious doubts hover over the domestic leagues' future.The ongoing crisis has highlighted a systemic failure in the country's football ecosystem brought about by poor governance, lack of long-term vision and the absence of proper youth development programmes.The year was also marked by frequent hearings at the Supreme Court and intervention from the union sports ministry to resolve the crisis. Even President Droupadi Murmu asked the stakeholders of Indian football to work together for the upliftment of the game in the country, reflecting the severity of the situation.When the Supreme Court approved the draft Constitution of the AIFF, prepared by former apex court judge L Nageswara Rao, in September, it was believed that a solution amenable to all concerned parties would finally be arrived at.However, no such thing happened in the ensuing months.Amid the gloom surrounding the sport, the women's national teams and the junior squads have impressed with their performances, raising hopes of a better future. In Chiang Mai, Thailand in July, the women's team scripted history by qualifying directly for the AFC Women's Asian Cup 2026, a feat never achieved before.Up against regional heavyweights and hosts Thailand in the final, the Indian women rode on Sangita Basfore's brilliant brace to emerge winners and make a statement of sorts. The achievement reminded one of former AIFF president Praful Patel's old statement that chances of the Indian women's team playing in a FIFA World Cup before their male counterparts are higher.While the girls still have a long way to go, they are definitely moving in the right direction.In another milestone, Indian Women's League reigning champions East Bengal FC became the first team from the country to win a main-draw match in the AFC Women's Champions League, helping the side earn a direct spot in the league stages of the next edition.As far as the junior teams were concerned, the India squad lifted its seventh SAFF U-17 Championship title in Sri Lanka, edging out Bangladesh in a dramatic final that went to penalties after a 2-2 stalemate.Under the guidance of Bibiano Fernandes, India then shocked continental giants Iran 2-1 to qualify for their 10th U-17 Asian Cup finals, even as the struggle to monetise the sport continued without a solution in sight.",Indian football remained in a state of terminal decline after experiencing arguably its darkest phase in a year marked by severe administrative crisis.

The return of war

A story that lives on

On Christmas morning in 1914, something happened that no military plan could have predicted and no weapon could have forced. In the middle of World War I , one of the bloodiest conflicts in human history, soldiers laid down their guns and stepped out of their trenches. And what did they do? They ended up playing football.For a few precious hours, war made way for humanity. This moment, now known as the Christmas Truce, remains one of the most powerful stories ever told about football and peace.Fought between the Allied Powers, backed by France, Britain, Russia, later joined by the US, Italy, and Japan, and the Central Powers, led by Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria, World War I had erupted in the summer of 1914.Europe was torn apart as nations rushed into battle with confidence and somewhat misplaced optimism.Many soldiers believed the war would be short.“Home by Christmas,” they said.Instead, by December, the war had stalled into a brutal deadlock. Soldiers on both sides were trapped in muddy trenches across Belgium and northern France.Life there was unbearable. Freezing cold, constant shelling, disease, hunger, and fear became daily companions.Young men, many of whom were barely out of school, faced death every hour.Christmas was approaching, but joy felt impossible.On the night of December 24, something strange happened along parts of the Western Front. British soldiers heard singing coming from the German trenches.At first, they suspected a trick. But the tune was unmistakable. The Germans were singing Christmas carols.“Stille Nacht”, which translates to Silent Night in English, floated gently through the cold air. British troops replied with their own songs.Soon, laughter replaced gunfire. Shouts of “Merry Christmas!” crossed no man’s land, the deadly strip of ground that usually meant instant death.Against all logic, the blazing sounds of gunfire went silent.As dawn broke on Christmas Day, soldiers cautiously climbed out of their trenches. Hands raised. No weapons. No orders. No one fired.British and German soldiers met in the middle. They shook hands. They smiled awkwardly. They exchanged cigarettes, chocolate, buttons, badges, and even small gifts sent from home.Photographs of loved ones were shown. Stories were shared. For the first time, soldiers saw the faces of the men they had been told to hate. They discovered something shocking. The enemy looked just like them.Then came the football. In some places, it was a proper leather football. In others, it was a bundle of rags tied together. It didn’t matter. There were no goalposts, no referee, no rules. Hwever, soldiers marked goals with caps or coats. Their boots were heavy, and the ground was frozen and uneven. But they couldn't care less.British soldiers kicked the ball with German soldiers. Scores were kept loosely, if at all.Some accounts claim the Germans won one match 3–2. Others say the result didn’t matter, because the real victory was simply playing.Soldiers used the calm to recover bodies that had been lying in no man’s land for weeks. Joint burial services were held. Prayers were said together.Men who would soon be ordered to kill each other stood side by side in silence.Many later wrote letters home describing how surreal it felt.One British soldier wrote that it seemed “too wonderful to be real.” Another admitted he struggled afterwards to fire at men he had just shared laughter with.The Christmas Truce was never officially approved. High-ranking officers were furious when they learned what had happened. To them, the truce threatened discipline and the will to fight.Orders were quickly sent down the line. By December 26, the guns roared again. The war resumed its brutal course. Many of the men who played football that day would be killed in the months that followed.For years, the Christmas Truce was pushed aside. Military leaders feared it showed too much humanity in war. Some reports were censored. Others were ignored. But stories have a way of surviving.Letters were found in attics. Diaries were published. Veterans spoke quietly of that day when the war stopped making sense. Slowly, the truth emerged.Football already belonged to everyone in 1914. It was played in England, Germany, France, and beyond. It needed no shared language. No explanation. You just kicked the ball.That simplicity made football powerful. It reminded soldiers of home. Of weekends. Of joy. Of life before the trenches.Football did not end the war. But it proved that hatred was learned, and humanity was natural.Today, more than a century later, the Christmas Truce is remembered across the football world. Memorial matches are held. Statues stand near former battlefields. Clubs and fans share the story every December.Because on Christmas Day in 1914, football did something extraordinary. It reminded the world that before we are soldiers, enemies, or nations, we are human beings. And sometimes, a simple game is enough to make us remember that.","In the middle of World War I, soldiers laid down their guns and stepped out of their trenches.

KALYANI: Captain Dangmei Grace struck a brace as Sreebhumi FC registered a resounding 4-0 win over Gokulam Kerala FC in an Indian Women's League match here on Wednesday.Grace was the standout performer, scoring in the fourth and 59th minutes, while midfielder Rimpa Haldar added the third goal in the 66th minute before Anju Chanu rounded off the scoreline in the 77th minute.The contest was effectively set in motion within the opening minutes, with Sreebhumi wasting no time in asserting themselves. Barely four minutes had elapsed when Grace opened the scoring, capitalising on a swift move down the right flank. Sibani Devi swung in an inviting cross, and the Sreebhumi captain rose above defender Kritina Devi to power a header into the net.Stung by the early setback, Gokulam Kerala attempted to respond with greater urgency, but found space and time hard to come by.Sreebhumi continued to look threatening, with Sibani Devi and Rimpa Haldar dictating proceedings from midfield.The confidence gained from a strong first half translated seamlessly into the second. Sreebhumi resumed with renewed intensity and doubled their advantage in the 59th minute. Haldar slipped a precise through ball into the penalty area, and Grace timed her run perfectly to guide the ball home.Gokulam's resistance faded further seven minutes later when Rimpa Haldar added a third.Picking up possession at the edge of the box, she showed composure to round goalkeeper Sowmiya N before rolling the ball into an empty net.The rout was completed in the 77th minute. A cross from the left caused chaos inside the Gokulam box, with Sowmiya initially saving Sibani Devi's effort and Anju Tamang clearing off the line. The danger was not fully averted, however, as Anju Chanu reacted quickly to loft the ball over the goalkeeper into the net.Garhwal United pip Kickstart==================In Kolkata, Garhwal United earned their second win in as many matches, defeating Kickstart FC Karnataka 1-0.Lhingdeikim (79th) scored the only goal of the match as newly promoted Garhwal United provisionally moved to the top of the table with six points from two matches -- two ahead of second-placed Nita Football Academy.","Sreebhumi FC registered a resounding 4-0 win over Gokulam Kerala FC in IWL.

Poll Do you think Aston Villa can win the Premier League this season? Yes, they have a strong chance No, they will fall short Not sure yet They need to improve further

Aston Villa continued their stunning Premier League title charge on Sunday as Morgan Rogers’ brilliant brace sealed a 2-1 victory over Manchester United at a raucous Villa Park, extending Unai Emery’s side’s extraordinary winning run.Rogers put Villa ahead late in the first half with a moment of individual brilliance before restoring the lead after the break, his goals securing a 10th consecutive victory in all competitions and keeping the Midlands club firmly in the title conversation.Third-placed Villa now sit just three points behind leaders Arsenal and one adrift of Manchester City, chasing what would be their first English league title since 1981. Their current run is their best in all competitions since 1914, while seven straight top-flight wins marks their strongest league streak since the 1989-90 season.Villa’s rise has been remarkable given their dismal start to the campaign, when they collected just two points and scored a single goal from their opening five matches — their worst beginning for 28 years. Under Emery, however, Villa Park has become a fortress, with only one Premier League home defeat in 2025, fewer than any other side.Even Manchester United, who had lost just once in their previous 26 visits to Villa, could not halt Emery’s momentum. United briefly responded after Villa’s opener, Matheus Cunha finishing clinically after Matty Cash gifted possession on the stroke of half-time.But the loss of captain Bruno Fernandes to an apparent hamstring injury at the interval proved decisive. Already depleted by injuries, suspension and Africa Cup of Nations absences, Ruben Amorim’s side lacked control after the break.Villa regained the lead in the 57th minute when Rogers showed greater hunger than Leny Yoro, pouncing on a loose ball in the box and finishing confidently for his sixth goal in as many league appearances. Emery celebrated wildly on the touchline, tossing his jacket skywards as Villa closed in on another statement win.United had chances to respond, with Emiliano Martinez producing key saves and Cunha wasting a gilt-edged header, but Villa held firm. Amorim handed a debut to teenager Jack Fletcher late on, yet the evening belonged to the hosts.",Aston Villa beat Manchester United 2-1 at Villa Park on Sunday.

Fans throw objects, vandalise stadium after Messi leaves early | Hyderabad next

NEW DELHI: Former India football captain Bhaichung Bhutia has strongly criticised the chaos that took place during Lionel Messi ’s public event at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata.Speaking on Sunday, Bhutia called the incident unfortunate and said sports events should always be treated with importance, without unnecessary delays caused by politics or formalities.He said fans come to stadiums to enjoy the sport and watch their favourite players, not to sit through long speeches or wait for VIPs to arrive.“I think when there is a sports event, sports should get priority,” he said.He also pointed out that this problem is seen often across India. According to Bhutia, many sporting events are delayed because organisers wait for politicians or chief guests. He said such practices only harm the experience for fans and players.“Many times across India, we see sporting events getting delayed because of political speeches, chief guest handshakes and all that. That is not necessary. Fans and players are coming to watch the sport, and the sport should begin rather than waiting for VIPs.”Talking about Lionel Messi’s recent G.O.A.T. Tour of India, Bhutia said the response from fans clearly showed what people really want. He said fans in Kolkata and other cities only wanted to see Messi and enjoy the sport, without any extra drama.“It was good to see not just in Kolkata, but across different cities, fans just wanted to see the sporting event, who just wanted to see Messi and nothing else.”Bhutia hopes that what happened in Kolkata will act as a wake-up call for organisers and authorities in the future.“I hope this is a lesson we will learn and that this trend will change,” he added.The promotional event featuring Lionel Messi turned chaotic due to poor planning and crowd control.Thousands of fans were disappointed as politicians, celebrities and officials surrounded Messi, limiting his interaction with the public.His time on the field was also cut short.

Erling Haaland continues to motor along at better than a goal a game for Manchester City in the Premier League His latest victim was West Ham on Saturday.The Norway striker scored in each half to move to 19 goals in 17 matches in this campaign and also set up Tijjani Reijnders' goal in a 3-0 win at Etihad Stadium on Saturday.The victory lifted City into first place, a point ahead of Arsenal before the deposed leader's match at Everton later Saturday.Haaland has 38 goals in a combined 28 games for club and country in what is shaping up to be the most prolific season of his career. Injury permitting, the season will end in him going to his first World Cup with Norway.His double gave him 104 in the Premier League, one more than Cristiano Ronaldo having played 122 games fewer.Haaland scored at the second attempt from Phil Foden's cross to give City a fifth-minute lead and took advantage of a defensive mix-up to make it 3-0 in the 69th. In between, Haaland slipped a short pass to Reijnders, who took a touch and rifled a shot into the roof of the net in the 38th.Woltemade's week What a difference a week made for Nick Woltemade.Last weekend, he scored an own-goal to consign Newcastle to a derby loss at fierce rival Sunderland.Six days later, he netted twice in the opening 20 minutes to give his team a fast start against Chelsea.Chelsea recovered, though, to draw 2-2 with Joao Pedro's equalizer coming off a rare assist from a goalkeeper.Robert Sanchez smashed a long clearance up to Pedro, who headed the ball forward and ended up collecting it himself after Fabian Schar slipped. Pedro slotted a finish underneath Newcastle goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale to earn Chelsea a point in the 66th.""I wanted to give a good performance today and I think I did,"" Woltemade said. ""I just want to say thank you to the fans for still being good with me.""Reece James launched Chelsea's fightback by curling a free kick in off the post after halftime.Chelsea stayed in fourth place and has won only one of its last five games in the league.

Armando Broja grabbed Burnley's equalizer in the 90th.Sunderland is doing much better since promotion. A 0-0 draw at Brighton put the north-east team in fifth place.Remaining games There are three more games to be played on Saturday: Tottenham vs. Liverpool, followed by Everton vs. Arsenal and Leeds vs. Crystal Palace.",Erling Haaland scores twice in Manchester City's 3-0 win over West Ham.

Lionel Messi India tour: Inside story of what went wrong in Kolkata

NEW DELHI: Satadru Dutta, the main organiser of Lionel Messi’s event held on December 13 and now under arrest, has told investigators that the footballer was unhappy with physical contact during his appearance at the Salt Lake Stadium and left the venue before completing the scheduled programme, news agency PTI reported on Saturday, quoting a source in the Special Investigation Team (SIT).During questioning, Dutta told SIT officers that Messi ""did not like being touched on the back or being hugged"" and that this concern had been communicated in advance by foreign security officials assigned to protect the footballer, the source said.""Despite repeated public announcements to restrain the crowd, there was no impact. The manner in which Messi was surrounded and embraced was completely unacceptable to the World Cup-winning footballer,"" Dutta told investigators during his grilling on Friday, the source added, as cited by the PTI.West Bengal sports minister Aroop Biswas was seen close to Messi during the programme, with visuals showing him holding the footballer around the waist while posing for photographs. Biswas has been accused of using his influence to allow relatives and personal acquaintances access to Messi. Amid criticism, he resigned from his post as sports minister pending completion of the investigation.Investigators are examining how a large number of people were allowed to access the ground area.Dutta claimed that initially only 150 ground passes were issued, but the number was tripled after a ""very influential person"" arrived at the stadium and ""overpowered him"". Police are checking whether the increase in access led to the crowd control failure.""The arrested accused also claimed that once that particular influential person reached the stadium, all the flow-chart for the Messi programme got disturbed and he could not control it,"" the official told PTI.Dutta also shared financial details related to Messi’s India visit. ""Lionel Messi was paid Rs 89 crore for the tour, while Rs 11 crore was paid as tax to the Indian government,"" he told investigators, putting the total cost at Rs 100 crore. Sources said 30 per cent of the amount came from sponsors and another 30 per cent from ticket sales.SIT officers also found more than Rs 20 crore in Dutta’s frozen bank accounts. On Friday, they seized several documents during raids at his residence.""Dutta claimed that the amount in his bank account was the money which he got from selling the tickets for the Messi event in Kolkata and Hyderabad and also from the sponsors. We are verifying his claims,"" the officer said.What was supposed to be a marquee football spectacle turned into widespread violence and disorder at the stadium last week after Messi’s brief and tightly ring-fenced appearance, his first at the venue since 2011, left large sections of the crowd frustrated.They failed to catch a glimpse of their superstar despite having travelled from far and wide, paying hefty sums for tickets.The West Bengal government has formed an SIT comprising senior IPS officers Piyush Pandey, Javed Shamim, Supratim Sarkar and Muralidhar to investigate the vandalism, security lapses, access violations and the role of organisers and officials in the incident, the officer added.","Satadru Dutta, the main organiser of Lionel Messi’s event held on December 13 and now under arrest, has told investigators that the footballer was unhappy with physical contact.

A trophy with a meaning

The hollow in a million hearts

A new trophy, a new start

A forgotten memory

NEW DELHI: Looking back today, it feels almost unreal that the original FIFA World Cup trophy no longer exists.In an era where constant digital tracking and tight security were absent, football lost one of its most treasured symbols quietly and permanently. The Jules Rimet Trophy, which crowned the world champions of football for four decades, was stolen in 1983 and never recovered.The Jules Rimet Trophy was the first official World Cup prize. It was awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup from 1930 to 1970. Named after Jules Rimet, the former FIFA president who played a key role in starting the World Cup, the trophy carried enormous historical value.It was made of solid gold and featured a sculpted figure holding a cup, making it instantly recognisable to fans across the world.For Brazil, the trophy had special meaning.The country first won the World Cup in 1958 and defended the title in 1962. Brazil won the tournament in 1970 for the third time, completing a remarkable journey.At the time, it was under FIFA rules that any country that won the World Cup three times was allowed to keep the Jules Rimet Trophy permanently.Led by football legend Pelé, Brazil’s victory in 1970 gave the nation permanent ownership of the trophy.After the celebrations ended, the Jules Rimet Trophy was placed at the headquarters of the Brazilian Football Confederation in Rio de Janeiro.It was displayed in a glass case and treated as a symbol of Brazil’s football greatness. Security arrangements were modest, reflecting a time when the idea of stealing such an object seemed unlikely.That sense of safety did not last.In December 1983, the Jules Rimet Trophy was stolen. It all happened under the night skies when thieves broke into the CBF building. They damaged the display case and took the trophy.When officials arrived later, they found that the most famous prize in football history was gone.News of the theft reached the ears of the general public soon across Brazil and beyond. In a country where football makes people fanatics, the loss was deeply felt.The trophy was not only the representation of their success on the pitch, but it also stood for generations of players and moments that shaped the sport.Brazilian police launched an investigation immediately. Over time, several suspects were arrested, including a jeweller. Investigators worked to trace the trophy and understand the motive behind the theft. Their findings pointed to a simple but devastating conclusion. The Jules Rimet Trophy was made of solid gold, and gold could be melted.According to the investigation, the trophy was melted down and sold as gold. This conclusion was based on police evidence and statements from those involved.Once melted, the trophy lost its identity completely. No markings, shapes or features remained. Not a single piece of the original Jules Rimet Trophy has ever been recovered.This was not the first time the trophy had been stolen. In 1966, ahead of the World Cup in England, the Jules Rimet Trophy disappeared from an exhibition in London.In an interesting end to the saga, the trophy was found wrapped in newspaper under a hedge by a dog named Pickles.It was soon returned safely, and the incident became part of football folklore.The 1983 theft in Brazil had no such ending.With no hope of recovery, Brazil later commissioned a replica of the Jules Rimet Trophy. The replica was placed on display to preserve the memory of Brazil’s achievement.However, it could not replace the historical value of the original trophy that had been lifted by champions from 1930 onwards.The disappearance of the Jules Rimet Trophy also influenced how football treated its prizes.After Brazil’s third World Cup win, FIFA introduced a new trophy, first awarded in 1974. The current FIFA World Cup Trophy is not permanently awarded to any nation. Winners lift the original trophy during celebrations but are later given a replica to keep. The original remains under FIFA’s control.The loss of the Jules Rimet Trophy forced FIFA to look at this rule with a strict eye.For Brazil, the theft was especially painful.The 1970 team is widely considered one of the greatest sides in football history. Players like Pelé, Jairzinho, Rivelino and others created moments that will forever be in the memories of the fans.The trophy they earned through skill and success on the field was lost through negligence and crime.The story continues to be remembered even after decades.Authorities believe they know what happened to the trophy. Yet, the sense of loss remains because the outcome cannot be reversed.Football history was erased in physical form.Today, fans can only see photographs and replicas of the Jules Rimet Trophy. Museums display its likeness, and books recount its journey. But the original, which once travelled across continents and crowned the first world champions, no longer exists.The stolen World Cup trophy stands as a reminder of a different era. It shows how even the most valuable symbols can be lost if they are not protected. It also highlights how fragile history can be.Football has moved forward since then. New trophies have been lifted, new legends have emerged, and new memories have been created. Yet the story of the Jules Rimet Trophy remains one of the sport’s most sobering chapters.It is a throwback to a time when the World Cup could disappear. And never return.","The Jules Rimet Trophy was the first official World Cup prize. It was awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup from 1930 to 1970. For Brazil, the trophy had special meaning.

Kansas City Chiefs locker room culture starts with Mahomes and Kelce



Kansas City Chiefs offensive lineman Creed Humphrey is not talking about trophies or playoff runs right now. Instead, he is focused on the people who shape the heart of the locker room and the culture that keeps the team grounded even in disappointment. For the first time in a decade, Kansas City is watching the postseason from home. Yet inside the building, the standard has not shifted, and Humphrey’s words reveal why the foundation remains strong.At 26, Humphrey has already seen enough NFL seasons to know that talent alone does not sustain a franchise. What stands out to him is the daily energy that surrounds Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce . The wins may pause, but the mindset does not. That consistency, he believes, keeps the Chiefs connected and motivated, even when the season ends earlier than expected.Humphrey does not hesitate when describing his superstar teammates. “They're awesome. As good of football players as they are, they're just as good human beings,” says Humphrey while promoting his partnership with Dairy Queen. The respect goes beyond game day performance. He points to how approachable and genuine they are, qualities that quietly set the tone for everyone else.“Being able to be around them and become close with them, it's been awesome,” he adds.According to Humphrey, Mahomes and Kelce “are always bringing great energy” and “great vibes throughout the day” to the team. That presence matters. “You can tell they love what they do, and that's infectious throughout the locker room, so it's awesome to be around.”That same spirit showed up when Kelce shared personal news during training camp. When the tight end announced his engagement to Taylor Swift , the reaction inside the facility was pure support. “Big congrats to him, that's awesome,” says Kelce's teammate, reflecting the unity that defines the group.Humphrey also credits head coach Andy Reid for nurturing that environment. He calls Reid “one of the best, if not the best to ever do it.” “[Coach Reid] is an offensive lineman himself, so he understands it and shows a lot of love to the big guys,” says Humphrey. “It's a lot of fun just being around him and seeing the plays he's cooking up and all the crazy things we do out there.”Off the field, those bonds stay strong. Humphrey recently teamed up with fellow linemen for a Dairy Queen shoot at his Kansas City home. “We had a lot of fun,” Humphrey says. “It was a blast. You know, it's a bunch of big guys hanging around, doing a shoot and eating a lot of food.” Offensive tackle Kingsley Suamataia, he notes, “put away at least 30 chicken strips that day on the shoot.” Even Kelce chimed in online, commenting, “Dancin for DQ?!? I’m in on that!!!”In a season without a playoff chase, the Kansas City Chiefs are still leaning on something just as powerful. They are leaning on people who make the grind worth it.Also Read: Detroit Lions knocked out of NFL playoff picture as Vikings defense puts on statement performance in must-win showdown","Creed Humphrey calls Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce good human beings and leaders.

Detroit Lions playoff elimination exposes collapse driven by turnovers



Detroit Lions playoff elimination became reality on Christmas Day, a phrase few imagined repeating after the promise of last season. Detroit’s season officially unraveled in Minneapolis, where every remaining sliver of hope slipped away inside a noisy U.S. Bank Stadium. What entered the day as a mathematical possibility ended as a hard stop, with the Lions no longer controlling anything except the lessons they carry into the offseason.The timing made it sting more. Christmas football usually brings memories, not finality. Yet a 23-10 loss to the Minnesota Vikings sealed Detroit’s fate, dropping the Lions to 8-8 and erasing any path to January football. A year removed from owning the NFC’s top seed, the fall felt sudden and severe, especially for a team once viewed as a Super Bowl favorite.The Lions knew the math. Win out, get help from Green Bay’s collapse, and sneak back into the postseason picture. None of it mattered once the ball kept finding purple jerseys. Detroit turned the football over six times, an almost unthinkable number for a team that had coughed it up only eight times across its first 15 games. On this day, control vanished snap by snap.Quarterback Jared Goff endured one of the roughest outings of his season.He threw two interceptions and lost three fumbles, often under relentless pressure. Jahmyr Gibbs added another lost fumble, turning a manageable game into a defensive feast for Minnesota. Harrison Smith and Byron Murphy intercepted passes in the third quarter, while Andrew Van Ginkel recovered two fumbles. Jalen Redmond and Murphy added one each, closing the door firmly.Minnesota’s defense dictated everything. Brian Flores’ unit arrived with momentum and played like it, extending a remarkable streak of weeks without allowing a passing touchdown. The Vikings smothered Detroit’s run game and forced hurried decisions, leaving Goff visibly unsettled. This was not about one mistake. It was about sustained disruption.The result reshaped the NFC North standings. Minnesota climbed out of the cellar into third place, owning the tiebreaker after sweeping the season series. Detroit slipped behind, eliminated despite matching the Vikings’ record.Elsewhere, Green Bay benefited quietly. The Packers clinched their playoff spot without lifting a finger, their path cleared by Detroit’s defeat. For the Lions, the contrast with last season could not be sharper. Twelve months ago, they ruled the conference. Now, Christmas marked the end.Detroit leaves 2025 with questions, not excuses. Talent remains. Belief can return. But the margin between contender and outsider is thin, and on this day, the Lions crossed it.Also Read: Why a rare rule exception sidelined a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader during the team’s highly anticipated Christmas game","Detroit Lions eliminated from playoff race after 23-10 loss to Minnesota Vikings.

"NFL’s cryptic Stranger Things crossover post leaves fans amused, confused, and asking serious questions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfls-cryptic-stranger-things-crossover-post-leaves-fans-amused-confused-and-asking-serious-questions/articleshow/126180997.cms,"The NFL sparked online speculation with a cryptic video featuring individuals in pink, reminiscent of Netflix's Stranger Things. This eerie, context-free post, captioned with a question about concern, leveraged internet humor and ambiguity to drive engagement. The league's subtle approach blurred marketing and pop culture, effectively reaching younger audiences by participating in broader entertainment conversations.

Why the NFL’s Stranger Things tease worked so well online

The NFL rarely breaks the internet with subtlety, but a single post sent fans into speculation mode this week. A short video shared by the league featuring a group dressed in matching pink outfits, unmistakably tied to Netflix’s Stranger Things, quickly gained traction, not for football reasons, but for its eerie tone.Captioned with the line, “uhhhh should we be concerned @Stranger_Things,” the post blurred the line between sports marketing and pop culture storytelling, leaving fans debating whether the league was joking, teasing, or hinting at something bigger.At first glance, the clip feels deliberately unsettling: rows of people in coordinated pink attire, standing in formation, waving in unison. There’s no football action, no players, and no obvious context, which is exactly why it worked. The NFL leaned into internet humor, tapping into the same unease and curiosity that made Stranger Things a global phenomenon.By asking, “uhhhh should we be concerned 🤨,” the league essentially invited fans to write their own narrative. Some joked about mind control at stadiums. Others wondered if the video hinted at a halftime show, a Super Bowl crossover, or a deeper Netflix partnership. The ambiguity fueled engagement, pushing the post well past typical league content metrics.This moment also reflects how the NFL has evolved its digital strategy. Instead of relying solely on highlights and scores, the league increasingly positions itself inside broader entertainment conversations. Collaborations with streaming giants allow the NFL to reach younger, pop-culture-savvy audiences who may not tune in every Sunday but live online.What made the post especially effective is that it didn’t overexplain itself. No press release followed. No clarification was offered. The silence allowed curiosity to do the work, proving that sometimes the smartest marketing move is restraint.Also Read: Is Taylor Swift at the Chiefs’ Christmas game tonight with rumors growing that it could be Travis Kelce’s final game","The NFL sparked online speculation with a cryptic video featuring individuals in pink, reminiscent of Netflix's Stranger Things.

Who Is Jared Goff's Wife? (Getty Images)

Jared Goff and his wife, Christen Harper Goff, have quietly built a relationship that blends ambition, timing, and mutual trust. Their story did not unfold under stadium lights or red carpets. The couple’s bond has matured alongside Goff’s career, evolving through relocations, career risks, and life changing milestones.They met before being famous and stayed grounded through professional shifts. Marriage, parenthood, and public attention followed, but the foundation was already set. What stands out is not spectacle but intention. Each step forward was chosen, not rushed, and that patience continues to define how they move through life together.Christen Harper Goff is far more than a familiar face on the sidelines. Raised in Valencia, California, she built her own path early, stepping into acting as a child and later earning recognition as both a model and performer. Her early credits include a short film debut in 2004 and later appearances in projects such as Auggie and The Obituary of Tunde Johnson. Modeling followed with equal momentum. After reaching the final rounds of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Swim Search in 2021, she became co-Rookie of the Year in 2022, a milestone that reshaped her career.Her relationship with Goff began in a refreshingly candid way. In a 2022 Sports Illustrated video, she shared, “I was truly not looking for anything at the time. I had just gotten out of a long relationship and I was trying to stay single for a year. Then I met him and the rest is history.” Their connection also appears in Netflix’s Quarterback, where she recalls, “Jared was playing for the Rams. We just hit it off right away. They won a million games.” With humor, she added, “I was a good luck charm, obviously.”Marriage followed in 2024, and soon after, the couple announced they were expecting a daughter. Goff later said, “I can’t wait to watch her be a mom.” That sense of admiration runs both ways, especially during challenging transitions. When Goff was traded to Detroit, Harper Goff spoke openly about the cost of starting over. “That was really hard and it really affected just kind of like my identity and who I was,” she said. “I had a hard time at first because that was such a big sacrifice.”Beyond career shifts, she uses her platform to advocate self love and body confidence. Reflecting on industry pressure, she once said, “Instead of shrinking myself down into an unrealistic standard for my own body, I chose to have faith that I was enough.” That belief now defines her public voice and private life. In July 2025, the couple welcomed their daughter, Romy Isabelle, marking a new chapter built on the same steady values that brought them together.Also Read: Who is Ash Kaashh?

Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders experience a rare Christmas rotation moment



Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders know better than most that football does not pause for the holidays, even when Christmas lights are glowing and families gather around the table. For many inside the franchise, December 25 can feel like just another workday. Practices continue, routines are tightened, and appearances are expected. Yet some seasons unfold differently, creating rare moments when tradition bends. One such moment came quietly during a year that broke the usual mold, offering an unexpected Christmas memory that still stands out years later.Behind the glamour and precision of game day lies a schedule that demands sacrifice. When the Cowboys host a holiday matchup, the cheerleaders are expected to be there, no exceptions. Every step on the field is planned weeks in advance. Time with family often waits until the final whistle. But in 2022, an unusual roster decision changed the rhythm of that season in ways few anticipated.That year, the squad carried an extra dancer, bringing the total to 37 instead of the customary 36. According to Marissa Phillips, the decision was far from routine. “It's happened before, but it's pretty rare that they take extra,” Phillips tells PEOPLE three years later.Rather than reworking every formation, leadership chose a rotation system. Each cheerleader would sit out one game.Phillips’ turn landed on Christmas Eve. She still reported with the team, still followed game-day protocols, but her role shifted. From the press box, she watched the performance unfold with a new perspective. “So I didn't dance that game, but the cool thing about sitting out was you got to sit in the press box, and you got to eat all the food you wanted,” Phillips recalls. “I was watching the game, I was watching the girls dance, and I had a whole plate of Christmas Eve food. ”The night did not end at the stadium. Normally, the squad returns together to headquarters in Frisco. That evening, flexibility won out. “They allowed people to get straight in the car with their families. Some girls would get on Christmas Eve flights to go straight home, which was really sweet,” she shares.For Phillips, the drive back to Austin became its own holiday story. “We were driving back and it was midnight,” she remembers with a laugh. “We were like, 'At least we're going to make it before Santa does.'” In a season built on discipline and duty, that small break created a memory far more lasting than any routine on the field.Also Read: Inside Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s most intimate moments in Disney+ docuseries The End of an Era","Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders experience a rare Christmas rotation moment in 2022.

Christmas at Arrowhead Stadium has become synonymous with speculation about Taylor Swift’s whereabouts, but this year’s holiday matchup carries a very different tone. Fans tuning in for the Chiefs’ Christmas game against the Denver Broncos are searching for more than just a win, they’re watching closely to see if Swift, Travis Kelce’s fiancée, is in the stands.With Kansas City eliminated from playoff contention and facing one of its most turbulent seasons in years, Swift’s presence has taken on symbolic weight, representing comfort, closure, and possibly an era coming to an end.As of kickoff, Taylor Swift has not been officially confirmed to be at the Chiefs’ Christmas Day game. Her lower public profile during the 2025 season marks a noticeable shift from the media frenzy of prior years, when her appearances at Arrowhead often dominated headlines.While Swift has continued to attend select home games, she has largely skipped road contests, reinforcing uncertainty about her holiday plans.The intrigue is amplified by context. The Chiefs’ season unraveled earlier than expected after a devastating loss to the Chargers on Dec. 14, compounded by Patrick Mahomes’ season-ending ACL injury. For the first time in years, Kansas City will spend January watching the playoffs from home, casting doubt over the team’s immediate future, including Kelce’s.Statistically, Swift’s presence has coincided with stronger team success in past seasons, particularly in 2023 and 2024, when the Chiefs posted dominant records with her in attendance. That trend has faded in 2025, where Kansas City has struggled regardless of who’s in the stands, going just 3-3 in games Swift attended and 3-6 without her confirmed presence.If Swift does appear on Christmas, it could represent more than festive support. With retirement rumors swirling around Kelce and his engagement marking a major life transition, tonight may carry emotional significance, not just for fans hoping for a Swift sighting, but for a franchise quietly confronting the end of a defining chapter.Also Read: Taylor Swift is reportedly choosing a wedding dress that mirrors her relationship with Travis Kelce","Taylor Swift’s attendance at the Chiefs’ Christmas game against the Broncos is uncertain.

Travis Kelce NFL punishment: Chiefs veteran forces NFL into uncomfortable late-season decision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-kelce-nfl-punishment-chiefs-veteran-forces-nfl-into-uncomfortable-late-season-decision/articleshow/126180707.cms,"Travis Kelce's unusual media silence amid retirement rumors and the Chiefs' struggles has placed the NFL in an awkward position. While league rules mandate player availability, enforcement is inconsistent. This situation highlights Kelce's immense stature and raises questions about his future, marking a potential transition for both the player and the league.

Travis Kelce’s silence puts the NFL in an awkward spot as retirement rumors swirl

Travis Kelce has never been a player who hid from attention, which is exactly why his recent silence feels so loud. As the Kansas City Chiefs limp toward the end of a disappointing season, Kelce’s decision to avoid postgame media has quietly become one of the league’s most uncomfortable storylines.With retirement rumors growing louder and the Chiefs facing a rare down year, the NFL finds itself balancing protocol, optics, and the reality that one of its biggest stars may be nearing the end of an era. The situation has sparked debate well beyond Kansas City.NFL rules require players to be available to the media, particularly after games, but enforcement has always been inconsistent. Kelce’s absence from interviews over multiple weeks technically crosses into violation territory, yet the league has chosen restraint.That decision says as much about Kelce’s stature as it does about timing. Fining a future Hall of Famer amid retirement speculation would invite backlash, especially with the Chiefs already dealing with injuries, losses, and uncertainty at quarterback.Still, the criticism hasn’t gone away. Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk reminded fans that, “Players have been fined in the past, if/when the failure to comply with media obligations becomes chronic, and if the media covering the team complains about it.Sometimes, the media doesn’t make waves.” Some have made waves anyway, questioning whether Kelce’s silence reflects frustration, exhaustion, or a quiet emotional goodbye.Chiefs reporter Pete Mundo captured the mood with a pointed jab after a recent loss: “WILL TRAVIS KELCE TALK TO THE MEDIA AFTER THIS LOSS? -200 odds he passes, per usual, after a loss. Hope I’m wrong.”Beyond media drama, the larger story is legacy. At 36, with his contract expiring and the Chiefs facing roster changes, Kelce’s future feels genuinely open-ended. Engagement to Taylor Swift, life after football, and the physical toll of 11 seasons all factor into what comes next.Whether Kelce speaks again this season may not change outcomes on the field, but it underscores a transition moment, not just for the Chiefs, but for the NFL itself, preparing to move on from one of its most recognizable faces.Also Read: “Didn’t get her emotional”: Fans share mixed reactions after Travis Kelce’s letter to Taylor Swift is shown on screen","Travis Kelce's silence puts the NFL in an awkward spot as retirement rumors swirl.

Gisele Bündchen stepped back into the spotlight in a gold gown that quietly stole the show

Gisele Bündchen’s recent appearance in São Paulo marked more than a fashion moment, it signaled a calm, confident return to the spotlight on her own terms. Attending a Vivara jewelry event, the supermodel embraced a look that balanced strength and restraint, proving that statement dressing doesn’t have to feel theatrical.At a time when her personal life continues to draw attention, Bündchen let design, fit, and presence do the talking. The result was a masterclass in how intentional styling can feel powerful, wearable, and timeless rather than intimidating.The gold gown Bündchen wore worked because every element was deliberate. The knit fabric followed her silhouette closely without appearing rigid, allowing the dress to move naturally while maintaining structure. A vertical button-front detail created length and visual flow, subtly elongating the frame from neckline to hem. Long sleeves with extended cuffs added balance, grounding the bold color and keeping the overall look refined.Equally important was what she chose not to do. Her hair fell in relaxed waves, makeup stayed soft and natural, and accessories were minimal. Gold bangles layered over the sleeves echoed the gown’s tone without competing for attention.The effect was cohesive rather than styled-for-effect, reinforcing the idea that confidence often comes from simplicity.Beyond aesthetics, the appearance aligned seamlessly with Bündchen’s role as the face of Vivara’s Palace Collection. The look emphasized craftsmanship and thoughtful design, mirroring the brand’s focus on refined details rather than fleeting trends. Instead of leaning into spectacle, the styling highlighted restraint, a quality that often gives fashion its longevity.For everyday wearers, the takeaway is practical. Recreating this look isn’t about copying a luxury gown but understanding the formula: clean lines, stretch fabrics, vertical details, and a fit that feels comfortable. When those elements come together, even a bold color like gold can feel approachable.Bündchen’s appearance served as a reminder that true style doesn’t shout. Sometimes, it simply fits perfectly.Also Read: “Giselle gave him 1000 chances”: Tom Brady allegedly learned about Gisele Bündchen’s new marriage through his children","Gisele Bündchen stepped back into the spotlight in a gold gown that quietly stole the show at a Vivara jewelry event in São Paulo.

Patrick Mahomes’ mother Randi responds to Brittany’s holiday surprise with a message that struck a chord

As the NFL calendar barrels toward its most intense stretch, moments of quiet warmth can feel rare, especially inside households tied to championship expectations. That’s why a recent holiday exchange involving Patrick Mahomes ’ family resonated far beyond gift boxes and festive wrapping.Just days before Christmas, Mahomes’ mother, Randi, publicly reacted to a thoughtful surprise from her daughter-in-law, Brittany Mahomes, offering fans a rare glimpse into the personal relationships that help anchor one of football’s most scrutinized families. The moment stood out not for extravagance, but for its sincerity, timing, and unmistakable sense of gratitude.Randi Mahomes took to social media after receiving a carefully curated holiday package from Brittany that leaned into comfort and self-care rather than flash. The gift included Cozy Earth pajamas and Divi haircare products, items chosen with intention rather than obligation. Reacting to a video showcasing the gifts, Randi wrote, “Thank you, Brittany Lynne, this is so wonderful. I can’t wait to wear these Cozy Earth pjs and use my Divi. ”What elevated the moment was the handwritten note Brittany included, which framed the package as a pause button during a hectic season. “Happy holidays from Brittany and Divi.Wanted you to have some of my favorites for a cozy night of self-care during all the festivities. Enjoy,” the note read.While Brittany Mahomes does have a formal partnership with Divi, her inclusion of Cozy Earth reflected personal preference rather than sponsorship. That distinction mattered to fans, many of whom viewed the gesture as genuine rather than transactional. The exchange landed at a time when the Chiefs are navigating pressure, expectations, and an unforgiving schedule, making the reminder of family support feel especially grounding.In a league defined by results and narratives, this small holiday moment highlighted something steadier: the off-field bonds that quietly sustain elite athletes when the spotlight never dims.Also Read: Randi Mahomes steps up with a holiday giveaway to support families raising young athletes amid Patrick Mahomes' devastating injury","Patrick Mahomes' mother, Randi, expressed heartfelt gratitude for a thoughtful holiday surprise from daughter-in-law Brittany.

Josh Allen and Travis Kelce are two of the most well-known and respected players in the NFL right now. They both play vital roles in current times, yet they play different positions and affect the course of games in various ways. It's impossible not to compare their achievements, and long-term legacies as their careers carry on.In his 13th NFL season, Travis Kelce has changed what it takes to be a top tight end. Kelce has been a big part of the Kansas City Chiefs' dynasty, exhibiting strength, consistency, and brilliance in the playoffs. He and Patrick Mahomes have worked together really well, which has produced record-breaking touchdown passes and some of the best postseason performances in a long time.Josh Allen, on the other hand, is the perfect example of a franchise quarterback right now. Since joining the league in 2018, the Buffalo Bills star has used his arm strength, athleticism, and leadership to get his team out of a long postseason slump. It's hard to defend Allen since he can accomplish two things at once. He is also a big part of Buffalo's chances of winning the Super Bowl.Kelce's resume is full of awards for consistent achievement.He has been picked for the Pro Bowl every year since 2015 and has received many First-Team and Second-Team All-Pro honors. He possesses almost every major receiving record for tight ends, including postseason receptions and yards. He is also already on the NFL's All-Decade Team for the 2010s.Allen's awards show that he is becoming a top quarterback. He has been chosen for the Pro Bowl many times, finished high in MVP voting, and keeps setting records for the Bills franchise. Even though he hasn't won a Super Bowl ring yet, his playoff efforts, especially in high-stakes games versus Kansas City, have made him more well-known.Championships have already made Kelce's legacy shine. He has won three Super Bowls, and his postseason stats are on par with those of famous wide receivers, not just tight ends. His ability to perform better in January and February has been a big part of Kansas City's continued success.The story of Allen is a little different. There have been amazing playoff games and games that people will remember, but the ultimate championship moment is still absent. But at 29, his greatest years are still ahead of him, and many people say that if he wins the Super Bowl, he will immediately become one of the best quarterbacks of all time.When it comes to the Kelce vs. Allen discussion, context is important. Kelce's legacy is one of total greatness: he has records, rings, and is always there for his team. Allen's is still being written, and it is based on promise, power, and pursuit. One has already changed the history of his position, and the other is looking for the defining victory that could do the same for quarterbacks of his time.","Travis Kelce and Josh Allen are two of the most well-known and respected players in the NFL.

Anthony Davis' injury raises long-term Dallas Mavericks concerns



Cooper Flagg emergence sparks rebuild talk after Warriors loss



The Dallas Mavericks have received another blow. On a national stage against the Golden State Warriors, Dallas showed flashes of promise. However, it was not the best of times for the team as the night went on, Anthony Davis had to exit early with a groin issue. The 126-116 loss was painful.Considering the recent history of AD’s injury, at least since being traded from the Los Angeles Lakers, the conversation around the Mavericks is on the rise. Charles Barkley did not sugarcoat what he saw. The Hall of Famer rips AD’s consistency amid growing concern about Dallas’ direction as injuries once again defined a season that already feels fragile.The moment Davis left the floor, the tone of the game changed, and the Mavs went on to the direction of the crushing defeat despite Cooper Flagg’s game-high score.Anthony Davis’ night ended in the second quarter after he slowed while chasing a lead pass and grabbed at his groin. He limped to the bench, headed to the locker room, and was ruled out for the remainder of the game. The Mavericks offered no immediate timetable, but the reaction was swift.During ESPN’s coverage, Charles Barkley gave his thoughts without hesitation. “What are the Mavs gonna do? They’re in trouble now,” he said.“Because it’s clear to me that Anthony Davis, as much as we like him and love him as a player, he’s never gonna be healthy. … They’ve got to make a decision.”Davis has already missed significant time this season and carries a long injury history. Dallas acquired him, hoping for stability after seismic roster changes, but availability has again become the defining issue. Even coach Jason Kidd acknowledged the blow, saying, “Losing AD definitely hurt when one of our best players goes out.”The loss added to Dallas’ fifth straight road defeat and dropped the team to 12-20, a record that mirrors the uncertainty surrounding its core.While frustration hovered over Davis’ exit, Cooper Flagg delivered a standout performance. The 19-year-old rookie poured in 27 points on 13-of-21 shooting, adding six rebounds and five assists in his first NBA Christmas Day game. He attacked mismatches, absorbed contact, and showed poise beyond his age.Barkley did not hesitate to connect the dots. “I think I might move on,” he said. “If I was running the team, I’d say, ‘You know what? It’s Cooper’s team now.’”“I would move on ... this experiment is over,” Barkley said. “It’s time to do a full rebuild in Dallas. Build around Cooper Flagg.”Flagg’s performance placed him in rare company, becoming the first rookie since Pete Maravich to post a 25-5-5 line on Christmas Day.Also Read: Why did Charles Barkley lose cool on air?

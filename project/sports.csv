Abhishek Sharma press conference: On tough Australian conditions, Harshit Rana's fight

Poll Do you think Bumrah's performance was affected by trying too hard to take wickets? Yes, definitely No, it was just an off day

NEW DELHI: Former India batter Robin Uthappa offered a candid assessment of Jasprit Bumrah ’s rare off day, suggesting that the pacer tends to lose rhythm when he tries too hard to take wickets.Speaking on Star Sports after India’s four-wicket loss to Australia in the second T20I at the MCG, Uthappa said the team’s eagerness to force breakthroughs backfired early in the innings.“When we were bowling after scoring 125, the start was very important. If we had picked up two or three wickets in the first three or four overs, the game could have been closer because we have quality spinners in the middle overs,” Uthappa said. “I felt we were probably trying too hard to pick up wickets. So we got a little wayward.”Defending a modest total of 125, India needed early strikes from Bumrah, but the Australian openers, Mitchell Marsh and Travis Head, counterattacked brilliantly. Their 51-run opening stand set the tone for a dominant chase that was completed in just 13.2 overs. Varun Chakaravarthy dismissed Head and later added another scalp, emerging as India’s best bowler on the night.Uthappa singled out Bumrah’s performance for closer analysis, pointing to a recurring tendency. “I have observed that whenever Bumrah gets desperate to pick up wickets, he becomes slightly wayward. When he is disciplined and hits a good line and length, he mostly picks up wickets,” he explained. “Australia took full advantage of that waywardness at the start.”While Bumrah struck twice in his final over, the damage was already done. India’s lack of discipline in the powerplay allowed Australia to dominate early, leaving their bowlers chasing the game.",Robin Uthappa says Jasprit Bumrah loses rhythm when he tries too hard to take wickets.

NEW DELHI: Former India opener Shikhar Dhawan has shared a heartfelt message following the death of 17-year-old Australian cricketer Ben Austin, who succumbed to injuries sustained during a training session in Melbourne.Austin was hit in the neck while facing balls in the nets at Ferntree Gully ahead of a local T20 match. Despite being rushed to hospital and placed on life support, he passed away on Thursday — a tragedy that has left the cricket world in shock.“No words can ease the pain of losing someone so young. Ben Austin was only 17, with dreams yet to take flight. Thinking of his loved ones and the entire cricket family in this difficult time. Rest in peace, Ben,” Dhawan wrote on X.His message resonated deeply with fans across both nations, as players and officials offered condolences and tributes to the young cricketer.The tragedy has revived painful memories of Phillip Hughes, who died in 2014 after being struck in a similar manner. It has also reignited discussions about safety measures in the sport, particularly the use of neck and stem guards at the grassroots level.Across Australia, clubs and fans paid tribute through the “Bats Out for Benny” campaign — placing bats outside homes and clubhouses. Flowers, bats, and jerseys were also left at the Ferntree Gully Cricket Club nets, where Austin trained.The WACA team wore black armbands during their Sheffield Shield clash, while Australia and India’s women’s teams also sported armbands during their World Cup semifinal.A moving minute’s silence was observed before the India–Australia T20I at the MCG, where a packed crowd of 100,000 stood in mourning — united in grief for a young cricketer whose life and dreams were cut heartbreakingly short.","Ben Austin, 17, died after being hit in the neck during a training session in Melbourne.

Pakistan legend Wasim Akram has thrown his full support behind Babar Azam , saying the star batter still has “plenty of cricket left in him” and can achieve much more for the country.Babar has endured a lean run in recent months, struggling to find consistency across formats.

Babar, at the other end, remained unbeaten on 11, breaking Sharma’s record of 4,231 runs in the process.Earlier, Salman Mirza and Faheem Ashraf combined brilliantly with the ball, sharing seven wickets as South Africa were bundled out for just 110.Wasim Akram, speaking to, urged fans and critics alike to rally behind Babar, insisting that one bad patch doesn’t define a player of his calibre. “Babar still has a lot of cricket left in him and can achieve much for Pakistan.We all need to support him,” Akram said.Before the T20I series, Babar had a modest outing in the two Tests against South Africa, scoring 131 runs at an average of 32.75.With 4,234 runs in 130 T20s, including 36 fifties and three centuries, Babar continues to be one of Pakistan’s most prolific modern-day batters.

Now that you've retired from cricket, many people believe that, since you were one of the top performers from Jammu and Kashmir, you could have played more. Did you take retirement a bit early?







You're from a very small Bijbehara town in Anantnag, and you became the first cricketer to represent India from Jammu and Kashmir. How difficult was it for you to make it to the top level?





Parvez Rasool is the first cricketer to represent India from Jammu and Kashmir

All this travel to reach your academy?





Your father and brother also played cricket. Did it help?





You are being credited for making cricket a household name in Kashmir and making youngsters dare to dream and believe that if they put in the hard yards, they can also make it big. We've seen that so many cricketers like Abdul Samad, Aqib Nabi, Umran Malik, and many more are now coming from J&K and making an impact. How do you look at it?





You've traveled all over India, all over the world. How is the ecosystem in Kashmir for coaching, scouting, basic infrastructure different from the rest of the country, even now, with so much improvement and interest?





Abdul Samad was once projected as the next big thing in Indian cricket. However, he couldn't live up to the hype that was created around him 3-4 years ago. Do you talk to him? What didn't work in his favour?





How real is the fear among domestic players that no matter how well they perform, the system won’t notice unless they’re from a strong board or big team?







Can you tell us one thing about domestic cricket that you feel outsiders, especially common people, don't understand? Something in domestic cricket that common people don't know about, no one talks about?





BCCI is the richest cricketing board. But still, domestic matches aren't telecast or live-streamed, so common people don't have exposure to domestic cricket. Do you feel BCCI should live-stream all the matches?





You played for so many IPL teams, played for India, but didn't get a long run anywhere. Do you think about it, or do you have any regret? Do you think it was unfair?





Parvez Rasool in action in the IPL

As Rohit Sharma and Kohli both have retired from Test, T20Is, and are playing only ODI cricket, and in the Australia tour, we saw their bodies were a bit rusty initially. In the first 2 matches, it showed in their batting, when they came into rhythm then they performed in the last match. So, do you think earlier, when they were playing all formats, there was a very busy schedule, but now they also should play domestic cricket to stay match fit and stay in rhythm?





Bishan Singh Bedi became J&K's coach in 2011. He hailed you as a ""brilliant all-round cricketer"". How did he contribute to your and Jammu and Kashmir cricket's growth?





Kashmir willow bats have long travelled across India and overseas. What never travelled was Jammu & Kashmir cricket or its players. Then Parvez Rasool showed up. He made his Ranji Trophy debut in 2008 and built a career that spanned 95 First-Class matches, 352 wickets and 5,648 runs. But numbers tell only part of the story. Rasool became the first player from J&K to earn an IPL contract, the first to play for India, and the first to make people look at J&K cricket as more than just a supplier of bats. From Bijbehara’s bus rides to the India cap, his story is about a door that finally opened — and others who walked through because he did.In an exclusive conversation with TimesofIndia.com, Rasool explains why he retired despite being J&K’s highest wicket-taker last season, why domestic performers from smaller states still struggle for recognition and opportunities, and how IPL performances overshadow domestic ones. Edited excerpts:No, I feel this was the right time to say thank you and work with the younger boys and junior cricketers at grassroots levels. We're happy that Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) cricket, which was little known earlier, has now been recognized. Players from J&K are now being recognized, and people have now started taking our cricket seriously. That's the very positive thing, and what makes me very happy is that I also contributed a bit, served J&K cricket a bit, I was captain for 6 years, and in between, I got the Lala Amarnath award twice (2013-14 and 2017-18).So, I thank god that I played with good performances by my side, played with respect, knowing when to leave. Even in the last Ranji [Trophy] season, I was the highest wicket-taker from J&K. But sometimes you feel that things aren't the same as they used to. So, when the time comes, one should say thank you meaningfully. I felt it's part of life, everyone has to say thank you, and I felt this was the right time for me.Difficult, definitely. Now in my area, we're contributing a bit to facilities for younger lads. I connect with my people because I know how much we've struggled. When we were young, we used to travel by bus, and as you know, I'm not from Srinagar, so we had to travel 50 km, carrying kit bags.Sometimes, bus drivers wouldn't even let us board because the kit bag was big, it was difficult for other people too.No, for trials. There was no academy in our area, and even now there isn't any. There was only 1 ground, in Srinagar, where there was a turf wicket. When trials happened, we would travel to Srinagar for 1 month, because in our area, all cricket happened on mat.There was a lot of support for me at home, and because of them, it became a bit easier. For other youngsters, it's not so easy to convince parents to play cricket in Kashmir, and especially for children from villages, because there's no opportunity, no facility and no one to look up to. We in J&K didn't have any role model in cricket, looking up to whom children could aspire.My parents, especially my father, always supported me. I always say that I was very lucky, because in villages, children don't get much encouragement to pursue cricket due to a lack of infrastructure or other facilities.Thereafter, I played Under-14, Under-19, and Under-23 for J&K, and thank God I performed at every level. Due to my performance in Under-23, I got included in the Jammu Kashmir Ranji Trophy team. I played my first game against Himachal, our team got all out around 110, in which I scored 40. When I was at my peak, I even got offers from big teams to play for them, but I always wanted our (J&K) cricket to rise, so I stayed here.It gives me immense happiness. Earlier, no one cared for our (J&K) cricket, but now, looking at all those cricketers coming from J&K makes me very happy.So do you see any cultural change, as in now parents encourage their children to pursue cricket, compared to when you started playing?Yes, a lot. There's a lot of cricket in the valley; you'll see so much cricket. I don't think in any part of India there's so much local cricket as there is here in Kashmir. In local cricket, there's so much passion, people have so much interest, they come in thousands to watch the game.Earlier, the path wasn't visible to youngsters. But when someone opens the doors, then a path is made. People feel like if they work hard, there's a chance they can play at a higher level.The structure doesn't exist at all. The infrastructure is the same as it was when I was playing or even before that. There's the same one ground, the Sher-e-Kashmir stadium in Srinagar; no ground has been built apart from it. There's one ground in Jammu. Apart from these 2 grounds, there's no other place.However, the Jammu Kashmir Sports Council (government body) has made some grounds. Some nets have been prepared, but they also need improvement. But Cricket association (JKCA) has the same 2 grounds. How will you make players without facilities?My belief is. Although you can defer. My belief is that players are made when you provide them with good facilities and infrastructure. Coaching is secondary. If you keep coaching, and won't give facilities to players, then things won't work out.I think Abdul Samad played well last year. Not just IPL but overal. He's a talented boy and right now performing too; last year also he scored 2 hundreds in the Ranji Trophy. Unfortunately, he was dropped in the quarter-final, I don't know why, what was the reason. It is understandable if you drop a player who has not performed but Samad had scored 2 hundreds in the Ranji Trophy and was dropped. When such things happen, the player also gets demotivated. But he has talent, I believe that in the coming time he'll do better.Yes, it's very important to have people speaking for you. Very important to back our players who are performing.Nowadays, our boy Aqib Nabi is performing exceptionally. Recently, in the Duleep Trophy, he bagged a five-wicket haul, which included four wickets in four balls. In the last Ranji Trophy match against Rajasthan, he took 7-wicket haul. But he is nowhere to be seen, not even included in the India A team. In small states, this problem remains; your performance doesn't get as much recognition as it deserves.Since IPL came, people have started taking domestic cricket very lightly. In entire [domestic] season if one player scores 600 runs or takes 30-40 wickets, but another player performs even once in IPL, then that player gets fast-tracked into the team.Feels a bit bad to think that some players work hard all year, for two seasons, but players who only perform in IPL get fast-tracked after one performance. So yeah, IPL overshadows domestic cricket performances a bit.Absolutely, to telecast all the matches is difficult, but they could be streamed on YouTube. People's perception will change a bit towards domestic cricket too if they get to see the matches. Because matches are very interesting.I believe that I didn't get as many opportunities as I should have. When I got into Pune Warriors [in 2013], that year I was the top all-rounder in the domestic season, after that I went to Pune. I thought I'd get to play, but I didn't. When they were out of the tournament then I got a match, and in the first game, I got Jack Kallis bowled for 23-24 runs. In the second game, I bowled one over and gave 5 runs, after that I didn't get any match.The way I was performing in first class, I also thought I would get a chance in Test cricket. The kind of wickets we made in India would have suited me as well.I debuted for India in Bangladesh and got two wickets on a very flat wicket, but I was dropped after one match. Then in 2017, I made my T20 debut in Kanpur against England but was again dropped after one game. I don't think that from one match anyone's performance can be judged.So definitely there'll be regret that I performed at the domestic level consistently, but I did not get enough chances. But thanks to Almighty for whatever chance I got to play for India.I feel these 2 players have played so much international cricket, and when Virat goes to the ground, because I've been with him in RCB and the Indian team, he does practice very seriously. If Virat Kohli gets out even in practice, or if he has done bad batting in the nets, he gets very angry with himself.So I think there's always an individual's call at this level, they (Virat and Rohit) know their body. They'll know if they need some practice or not. Like I play cricket, I know my body, I would know if I'm a bit rusty or not before the match, whether I need more match practice or not. So, to play domestic cricket or not should be Virat and Rohit's individual call.I always say that I learned my cricket from Bedi sir. He would not always tell you about action, or grip, or any other coaching-related thing. But he always motivated us and always talked about positive things.The most important breakthrough season was when Bishan Singh Bedi sir became our coach [in 2011]. He changed our mindset. Earlier, whenever J&K played, the thinking was that we were going only to participate. But Bedi sir taught us that 'you go and compete'. He taught us that we have to fight, not just participate. He brought the spark in me and Jammu & Kashmir cricket.He used to tell me that 'you have the ability, you can play'. Not only I, but J&K cricket also benefited from him.The J&K cricket team was absolutely nowhere when he became our coach; we used to lose 5 out of 5 matches. But when Bedi sir came, he changed our mindset. Bedi sir always encouraged players, 'go and express and back yourself and go boys play, that's it', he would say. That I'll always remember. He was a great person.",Parvez Rasool is the first cricketer to represent India from Jammu and Kashmir. Rasool became the first player from J&K to earn an IPL contract.

His current contract runs until December, after which he is expected to begin a three-year extension with Inter Miami.Messi, who recently wrapped up another sensational campaign as the top scorer of the regular MLS season with 29 goals in 28 matches, remains the favourite to claim the league’s Most Valuable Player award once again.Newcomer Son Heung-min ranks second with an $11.1 million annual salary, following his record-breaking $26 million transfer from Tottenham Hotspur to LAFC in August.The South Korean captain has made an instant impact, scoring nine goals in his first ten matches as LAFC head into the playoffs.Rounding out the top five are Sergio Busquets ($8.7 million), who plans to retire at season’s end, Miguel Almirón ($7.8 million) of Atlanta United, and Hirving “Chucky” Lozano ($7.6 million) of San Diego FC — all headline names underscoring MLS’s growing financial muscle and global appeal.","Lionel Messi is the top earner in Major League Soccer.

Poll Is Liverpool's season salvageable after the recent defeats? Yes, they can turn it around No, it's too late Maybe, depends on next few games

Liverpool’s season went from bad to worse on Wednesday night as they crashed out of the League Cup following a stunning 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Anfield — their sixth loss in the last seven matches across all competitions.Ismaila Sarr struck twice before halftime and Yeremy Pino added a late third, as Palace inflicted yet another humiliation on Arne Slot’s struggling side. The defeat compounds Liverpool’s growing crisis, coming just days after their 3-2 Premier League loss to Brentford, which further derailed their title defence.Slot’s decision to rest several key players — including Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz — backfired spectacularly. With one eye on crucial fixtures against Aston Villa, Real Madrid and Manchester City, the Dutchman fielded a largely second-string team featuring teenagers Kieran Morrison, Rio Ngumoha and Trey Nyoni.“It’s not Liverpool standards to lose six out of seven,” Slot admitted after the match. “But with the squad we have — maybe 15, 16 fit first-team players — this was the choice I had to make. The schedule is brutal, and next week will be even tougher.”The weakened lineup struggled to keep up with Palace’s intensity. Joe Gomez’s defensive lapse allowed Sarr to open the scoring in the 41st minute, before the Senegalese winger doubled the lead just moments before halftime from Pino’s assist. Substitute Amara Nallo’s late red card only deepened Liverpool’s woes, and Pino’s composed finish in the 88th minute sealed the emphatic win.The result means Palace have now beaten Liverpool three times in 80 days — following their Community Shield shootout win and a 2-1 Premier League victory.Liverpool’s latest defeat leaves Slot under increasing pressure as the club’s season threatens to unravel. With top players out of form, mounting injuries, and growing fan frustration, the next two weeks — featuring clashes against Villa, Madrid and City — could define the fate of his debut campaign.Meanwhile, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle all advanced to the quarter-finals after securing wins in their respective ties.","Liverpool crashed out of the League Cup following a 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace.

FIFA officially launched the second phase of ticket sales for the 2026 World Cup on Monday, putting another 1 million tickets up for grabs. This new phase marks the opening of a global ticket draw, which will run until 11 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday.A key feature of this round is the domestic exclusivity window for residents of the three host nations — the United States, Canada, and Mexico. During this period, local fans whose entries are selected in the draw will have the first chance to buy single-match tickets for games held in their respective countries.According to Heimo Schirgi, FIFA’s Chief Operating Officer for the tournament, interest in tickets has already been “massive” both globally and within the host nations. “This second phase, with its host country domestic exclusivity time slot, will allow us to say thank you to these local fans, while ensuring global opportunity as well,” Schirgi said.Fans from the three host nations can enter the draw until Friday. Winners will be randomly selected and granted a specific time slot between November 12 and 15 to make their ticket purchases. Notifications will be sent out at least 48 hours in advance.So far, residents of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico have led ticket purchases, followed by fans from England, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Argentina, and France. After the domestic phase ends, more slots will open globally from November 17, with further sales rounds to follow.Over 1 million tickets have already been sold, with fans from 212 countries purchasing seats. Twenty-eight of the 48 teams have qualified so far.Despite the buzz, logistical questions remain, especially around visa requirements for international visitors amid stricter U.S. immigration rules. Earlier this month, an Argentina friendly featuring Lionel Messi had to be shifted from Chicago to Fort Lauderdale due to slow ticket sales, which some linked to visa concerns.The 2026 World Cup, set across 16 venues in North America, will feature 104 matches and an estimated 7.1 million available seats. While FIFA hasn’t disclosed how many will be released to the public, base ticket prices started at $60 for select games, with premium seats — such as those for the U.S. opening match in Inglewood — priced between $560 and $2,735.In a first for the World Cup, FIFA will use, meaning ticket costs could rise or fall based on demand — a move that might push prices even higher on resale markets, where some listings have already crossed $60,000.","FIFA officially launched the second phase of ticket sales for the 2026 World Cup on Monday.

While all eyes remain on Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift ’s high-profile romance, the Kansas City Chiefs star’s ex-girlfriend Kayla Nicole reminded everyone she’s still very much a scene-stealer. On Halloween, the 33-year-old model and influencer turned heads with a stunning throwback tribute to Toni Braxton’s iconic He Wasn’t Man Enough music video from 2000 — and fans couldn’t stop talking about it.Kayla Nicole has been in the spotlight for years, but lately, she’s been embracing her independence with unapologetic confidence. The media personality, who dated Kelce on and off from 2017 to 2022, has spoken openly about how difficult their breakup was. Yet, she’s turned that heartbreak into empowerment, continuously showing the world her resilience — from acing her workouts during Super Bowl week to celebrating victories that have nothing to do with her ex.Earlier this year, Nicole proved her strength once again by surviving Special Forces: The World’s Toughest Test, where she was one of only two contestants out of sixteen to complete every grueling military-style challenge. And now, she’s conquered Halloween in style. Dressed in a sheer outfit mirroring Toni Braxton’s look from He Wasn’t Man Enough, Nicole delivered a spot-on recreation of the legendary R&B video.Her attention to detail was flawless — and her song choice didn’t go unnoticed. Braxton’s lyrics, “He wasn’t man enough for me,” had fans buzzing about whether the nod was intentional. One follower commented, “TMZ is about to have a time with this post. Theeee perfect costume + song! YOU ARE HER!”Even Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Bozoma Saint John couldn’t resist praising the look, writing, “YOU CLEARED THE ROOM!!!!! Omg. The level of petty, slayage and pure decimation needs to be studied.”The timing of Kayla’s costume comes amid growing speculation that Taylor Swift’s new song Opalite throws shade at Nicole. The track, rumored to be about Kelce, includes lines like, “You couldn’t understand it, why you felt alone / You were in it for real, she was in her phone,” which some fans linked to an old clip of Kelce scolding Nicole at dinner: “Oh my God. Get off your phone… You’re not even drinking your wine anymore, can we go?”While Kayla hasn’t directly addressed any of the chatter, her Halloween tribute spoke volumes. More than a costume, it was a statement — one that blended humor, confidence, and a touch of poetic irony.Having made it clear she’s moved on from dating athletes, Nicole recently said she’s now more interested in “an executive of a record label or a movie producer.” After her bold Halloween moment, one thing’s certain: Kayla Nicole knows how to turn any spotlight into her own stage.Also Read: “We would love to but..."": Tua Tagovailoa’s wife Annah opens up about her future family plans with Dolphins QB in heartfelt message",Kayla Nicole channeled Toni Braxton for Halloween.

The team has been fined $100,000 after officials determined that Baltimore misreported quarterback Lamar Jackson ’s injury designation ahead of their Week 8 clash with the Chicago Bears.The league found that Jackson was incorrectly listed as a “full participant” in practice despite dealing with a lingering hamstring injury. The procedural error has renewed questions about the NFL’s standards for injury transparency, as well as how teams handle communication regarding player availability, especially when star athletes like Jackson are involved.Head coach John Harbaugh defended the organization, calling the violation an “unintentional oversight.” According to Harbaugh, the confusion stemmed from Jackson’s involvement with the scout team instead of the starting offense, a situation that, under NFL rules, should have resulted in a “limited” practice designation. “Nobody’s trying to hide anything. There’s no advantage to be gained with that,” Harbaugh explained, insisting that the mislabeling was not meant to gain a competitive edge.Despite the explanation, the NFL proceeded with the fine, emphasizing the need for accurate reporting to maintain competitive integrity.While the penalty is minimal compared to the Ravens’ $621 million in 2024 revenue, the incident highlights the league’s growing scrutiny over medical reporting practices.Following the controversy, Lamar Jackson silenced critics with a commanding comeback performance, leading the Ravens to a 28–6 victory over the Miami Dolphins. The two-time MVP completed 18 of 23 passes for 204 yards and four touchdowns. “He’s a two-time MVP for a reason,” tight end Mark Andrews said. “With [number] 8 leading the charge, we’re a dangerous team.”Jackson’s chemistry with Andrews and receivers Charlie Kolar and Rashod Bateman proved crucial, while running back Derrick Henry’s 119-yard rushing night added balance to Baltimore’s offense. With back-to-back wins, the Ravens are determined to rewrite their early-season struggles and fight their way back into playoff contention.Also Read: Is Tyreek Hill’s season officially over?

Kylie Kelce claps back with humor while redefining her “real” signature look

Jason and Kylie Kelce are proving once again that laughter might just be the secret to their strong marriage. The beloved couple, who have become one of the most relatable duos in sports and entertainment, shared another candid moment on Kylie’s Not Gonna Lie podcast.During a Halloween-themed episode, the retired Philadelphia Eagles legend joined his wife to discuss viral costume ideas inspired by the Kelce family and one particular comment about Kylie’s supposed “signature look” had Jason joking in the most Jason Kelce way possible. Their lighthearted banter perfectly captured what fans adore about them: genuine humor, mutual respect, and unfiltered honesty.When Kylie read a TikTok suggesting fans could dress as “Philly’s Princess Kylie”, complete with a tiara, a Kelce jersey, and a miniskirt, she couldn’t help but laugh in disbelief. “A miniskirt?!” she reacted. Jason, never one to miss a beat, replied, “You are a miniskirt person.” Kylie challenged him immediately, to which Jason admitted, “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you wear a miniskirt. I wouldn’t mind it, though. ”The exchange quickly turned into a hilarious back-and-forth, with Kylie responding, “F------ asshole,” before bursting into laughter. It was a quintessential Kelce moment, playful, teasing, and refreshingly unscripted.Once the laughter died down, the couple decided to describe what a real “Kylie costume” would look like and the result was far more relatable. “Leggings or sweatpants, some type of hoodie,” Jason described. Kylie immediately agreed, saying, “Perfect. Look like a slob. Maybe wear glasses, and then you’re good.”The pair also joked about Jason’s own costume, with Kylie noting that fans could easily recreate his look with “a beard, a jersey, and flip-flops.”Later in the episode, the couple even touched on a fun family topic, whether Travis Kelce could babysit their four kids. Kylie admitted she’d trust him for “an hour, maybe two,” adding another glimpse of the Kelce family’s humor-filled dynamic.From teasing miniskirts to family chaos, Jason and Kylie Kelce once again proved that their unfiltered chemistry and down-to-earth love story make them one of America’s favorite celebrity couples.Also Read: “She grew up with Patrick”: Randi Mahomes reveals how Brittany became the heart of Patrick Mahomes’ world","Jason and Kylie Kelce shared a humorous moment on Kylie's Not Gonna Lie podcast.

“I don’t have any interest…”: Joe Alwyn’s old comments about Taylor Swift resurfaces and fans claim Travis Kelce is the total opposite,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/i-dont-have-any-interest-joe-alwyns-old-comments-about-taylor-swift-resurfaces-and-fans-claim-travis-kelce-is-the-total-opposite/articleshow/124992561.cms,"Taylor Swift's love life has shifted from a private romance with Joe Alwyn to a public spectacle with Travis Kelce. While Alwyn offered quiet devotion, Kelce brings an open, expressive joy. Friends say Swift is glowing, embracing this new chapter with confidence and living her love story out loud, on her own terms.

Joe Alwyn once called being Taylor Swift’s muse “flattering”

From Joe Alwyn’s quiet loyalty to Travis Kelce’s bold devotion





Before Taylor Swift ’s high-profile romance with NFL star Travis Kelce captured the world’s attention, the singer experienced a very different kind of love with British actor Joe Alwyn . Their six-year relationship was built on privacy, calm, and quiet devotion, a stark contrast to the spotlight-fueled excitement surrounding her current relationship.Alwyn’s composed attitude toward fame and his ability to protect their bond from media noise once defined Swift’s most peaceful chapter. Now, years later, Swift appears to have found joy in a more open and expressive love with Kelce. From game-day appearances to public displays of affection, she seems more confident and carefree than ever, embracing happiness on her own terms while rewriting what love looks like in her world.In a 2019 interview with The Sunday Times, Joe Alwyn was asked about the experience of having some of Taylor Swift’s biggest love songs inspired by him. His response was characteristically grounded and gentle. “No, not at all. No. It’s flattering,” he said with a calm smile.At the time, Swift had just released Lover, an album filled with romantic anthems like “London Boy” and “Cornelia Street”, both widely believed to be about Alwyn.Even on her previous record Reputation, songs such as “Call It What You Want” and “King of My Heart” hinted at their growing bond. Swift once described that era as one of emotional safety, telling fans she had found “stability” away from chaos.What made Alwyn stand out during their six-year relationship was his ability to tune out the noise. He told The Times he simply ignored media speculation: “I don’t have any interest in tabloids. I know what I want to do, and that’s this, and that’s what I am doing.”Swift echoed that sentiment in an interview with The Guardian, explaining, “I’ve learned that if I do [discuss my relationship], people think it’s up for discussion, and our relationship isn’t up for discussion.”Today, as Swift navigates a far more public love story with Travis Kelce, one often unfolding under stadium lights and social media frenzy, some fans can’t help but look back at her time with Alwyn as the quiet before the storm.However, Taylor Swift has never looked happier than she does with Travis Kelce. Friends close to the couple say she’s “glowing” and genuinely enjoying a new sense of freedom she didn’t always have in past relationships. Unlike her quieter years with Joe Alwyn, Swift seems to thrive in this more public love story, cheering from VIP boxes, holding hands after games, and embracing the spotlight with confidence.Those close to her note that Kelce’s openness and playful energy have brought out her fun, carefree side, describing their bond as “easy, supportive, and real.” For Swift, this chapter feels less like hiding from fame and more like finally living out loud, on her own terms.Also Read: Plans for kids already in motion as Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce plan their 2026 nuptials","Taylor Swift's six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn was built on privacy, calm, and quiet devotion.

Amy Trask on Lamar Jackson’s injury-report error

Lamar Jackson injury report timeline and what led to the Ravens’ fine

“limited”

“full.”

When Lamar Jackson’s practice status was changed days before a game for the Baltimore Ravens, the league took notice. On October 31, 2025, the NFL fined the Ravens $100,000 for misreporting Jackson’s Friday practice participation ahead of their game against the Chicago Bears.Former Las Vegas Raiders CEO Amy Trask weighed in. “The moment I heard about this issue, my immediate thought was they made a mistake,” she wrote on social media. Her comment came amid scrutiny of Jackson’s status: the Ravens originally listed him as a full participant in practice, then changed to limited participation and ruled him out of the Sunday game in Chicago after he struggled with a hamstring injury.Amy Trask, who led the Raiders as CEO from 1987 to 2013, has been outspoken about league compliance over the years.In her X (formerly Twitter) post, Trask said the situation looked like a simple error rather than a calculated rule-break.She wrote: “They made a mistake.” The Ravens’ violation stemmed from listing Jackson as fully participating when in fact he was limited to scout-team reps during Friday practice.Trask’s perspective reflects her belief that transparency in reporting matters hugely for trust in the league. The Ravens admitted the mistake and accepted the fine without appeal.Here’s what unfolded: On Friday, October 24, 2025, Jackson was listed as a full participant in the Ravens’ practice.The next day, October 25, Baltimore retroactively changed the listing to “limited” and then ruled Jackson out of the game vs. the Bears due to a hamstring injury.The league flagged the discrepancy because NFL rules state that even if a player is present but only running scout-team reps due to injury, the team must list him asnotThe Ravens’ initial reporting triggered an investigation.Also Read: Travis Kelce Vs Jason Kelce Net Worth In 2025: Who Is Richer, NFL Career Endorsements And More After reviewing, the NFL determined the violation was due to negligence, not an attempt to gain a competitive edge.

D’Andre Swift’s chronic groin injury sidelines Bears star before Bengals game

Kyle Monangai steps in as rookie running back to lead Bears offense against Bengals

D’Andre Swift has been fighting a groin injury since the start of this season. But now, he just can’t push through it anymore. The Chicago Bears have ruled him out for Sunday’s game against the Cincinnati Bengals. Head coach Ben Johnson called Swift’s injury “chronic,” saying it started even before Week 6. The team decided to rest him to make sure he can return stronger later.This is a big loss for the Bears. Swift has been their fastest and most reliable running back so far. His quick moves and burst speed helped the team get big gains out of the backfield. Without him, the Bears lose a major weapon. The hope is to have Swift back in two weeks when they face the New York Giants at Soldier Field.Chicago has already dealt with other groin injuries this year, cornerbacks Jaylon Johnson and Kyler Gordon both missed time earlier. Coach Johnson said they’re being careful with Swift to make sure he fully heals. “We’re just doing our best to get the best version of Swift for this team,” he said.With D’Andre Swift out, rookie Kyle Monangai will start his first NFL game. The seventh-round pick has done well in short bursts this season.He has 186 rushing yards on 42 carries and six catches for 61 yards, according to Sports Illustrated.His best game came against the New Orleans Saints, when he ran 13 times for a career-high 81 yards.Now, Monangai will get the ball a lot more. But he has one weakness, pass blocking. Pro Football Focus gave him the lowest pass-blocking grade on the Bears this season at 29.4. Monangai admitted he’s still learning that skill. “Things got better. I’m still improving at that every day,” he said.Also Read: Kayla Nicole’s Halloween Look As Toni Braxton Sends Fans Into Frenzy Over Hidden Message To Travis Kelce And Taylor Swift Running backs coach Eric Bieniemy has been working closely with him during practice. Monangai said he takes coaching seriously and always studies the playbook to prepare. “The playbook was my first priority when I came here,” he said.With backup Roschon Johnson also out because of a back injury, Monangai will carry most of the load against the Bengals. If needed, Travis Homer and Brittain Brown could also take some snaps. But for now, it’s Kyle Monangai’s big moment to shine.","D’Andre Swift has been fighting a groin injury since the start of the season.

His absence looms large as the Celtics navigate the early stages of the 2025-26 season, trying to maintain momentum against one of the league’s toughest opponents.Theis a marquee NBA Cup opener, but Boston’s lineup will look noticeably different without Jayson Tatum’s leadership and offensive presence. The 27-year-old suffered a torn Achilles tendon during last season’s Eastern Conference Semifinals against the New York Knicks, abruptly ending his playoff run and significantly altering Boston’s postseason hopes.

His disciplined approach to rehab reflects not only his physical recovery but also his mental resilience. While a comeback this season remains a personal goal, the Celtics’ medical staff and coaching team are managing expectations carefully, emphasizing long-term health over short-term returns.The Boston Celtics enter tonight’s matchup with a relatively healthy roster aside from Tatum’s ongoing absence. However, his missing presence on the floor has created a significant void in both scoring and leadership. To compensate, teammates Jaylen Brown and Derrick White have been tasked with taking on larger offensive roles, shouldering the responsibility of maintaining the team’s rhythm and intensity.Boston’s offensive identity - typically anchored by Tatum’s versatility and shot creation - has required recalibration. Coach Joe Mazzulla has emphasized a team-oriented approach, encouraging ball movement and defensive pressure to offset the loss of their All-NBA forward. While the Celtics remain competitive, Jayson Tatum’s absence is deeply felt, especially in high-stakes matchups like tonight’s against a red-hot 76ers squad led by Joel Embiid.As of now, there is no official timetable for Jayson Tatum’s return to the court. The Celtics have prioritized a cautious approach, ensuring that their superstar fully recovers before making any comeback attempts. Though Tatum’s return this season hasn’t been ruled out, the organization remains realistic about the challenges of Achilles recovery - a process that demands patience and precision.Also read: Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers regular season injury report: Who's playing, who's out, and more (October 31, 2025) In summary, Jayson Tatum will definitely not suit up for the Celtics tonight against the Philadelphia 76ers.

While Joel Embiid’s return headlines the roster, Philadelphia continues to deal with notable absences.

How the Lakers will Adjust in LeBron James' Absence?

Grizzlies Aiming to Capitalize on Lakers’ Short-Handed Roster

Thecontinue to navigate the early weeks of the 2025-26 NBA season without their, who remains sidelined due to a right-side sciatica injury. The condition, which affects the sciatic nerve running from the lower back down through the leg, has prevented the 40-year-old forward from making his season debut. As the Lakers prepare to face the Memphis Grizzlies at FedExForum on October 31, 2025, all eyes are on how the team adapts without its most experienced leader.This setback has raised broader concerns about the Lakers’ start to the season, as they’ve had to rely heavily on their supporting cast in the absence of their two biggest names - LeBron James and Luka Doncic. While the Lakers remain a strong and deep roster under new head coach JJ Redick, the lack of continuity among the starters has presented challenges in both offensive flow and defensive chemistry. With the NBA Cup group stage already underway, LeBron’s continued absence has shifted the spotlight toward the team’s younger talents. LeBron James has been ruled out of tonight’s game against the Memphis Grizzlies due to persistent irritation on the right side of his sciatic nerve.This issue, which causes pain radiating from the lower back through the glute and leg, has sidelined him since the preseason. The Lakers initially announced on October 9 that LeBron would miss at least three to four weeks while managing the nerve irritation in his glute area.According to head coach JJ Redick, sciatica is “a tricky condition” with no definitive recovery timeline, but team doctors are cautiously optimistic that LeBron could return by the second or third week of November. This marks the first time in his illustrious 23-year NBA career that LeBron is missing the season opener, an indication of both the seriousness of the injury and the team’s focus on long-term preservation.LeBron’s absence has created a leadership gap both on and off the court. In response, players like Austin Reaves have stepped up, taking on more responsibility as primary playmakers and scorers. Reaves has been instrumental in maintaining offensive rhythm, while also helping guide a younger locker room through the early stretch of the season. The Lakers ’ offensive structure has undergone adjustments, with Redick emphasizing more ball movement and spacing to compensate for LeBron’s missing playmaking presence. Defensively, the team has turned to Rui Hachimura and Jarred Vanderbilt to help fill the void, though neither can replicate LeBron’s on-court impact or game IQ.Sciatica occurs when the sciatic nerve becomes compressed or irritated, leading to pain that travels from the lower spine through the hip and leg. For an athlete like LeBron, this type of injury can affect mobility, balance, and explosiveness - all crucial aspects of his game. Considering his age and mileage, the Lakers are opting for a cautious recovery plan, prioritizing long-term health over short-term gains.Medical experts have noted that recovery can vary greatly depending on the severity of the nerve irritation. While some cases resolve within weeks, others can persist longer, requiring ongoing therapy and rest. The Lakers’ medical staff continues to monitor LeBron’s progress daily, with updates expected in early November.Tonight’s matchup against the Memphis Grizzlies offers another test for the Lakers’ depth. With LeBron unavailable and Luka Doncic listed as questionable due to multiple injuries - including a left finger sprain and lower leg contusion - the team will once again depend on its role players to deliver. Reaves, D’Angelo Russell, and Anthony Davis are expected to shoulder most of the offensive responsibilities.This game would have been LeBron’s 52nd regular-season meeting with the Grizzlies, a team he has historically dominated, averaging close to 26 points, 8 assists, and 8 rebounds per game against them. His absence not only alters the Lakers’ offensive dynamic but also gives Memphis an opportunity to exploit mismatches in transition and perimeter defense.The Memphis Grizzlies enter this game with their own injury concerns but will likely look to take advantage of the Lakers’ missing superstars. Expect the Grizzlies to push the pace and apply defensive pressure early to disrupt the Lakers’ ball handlers.For Los Angeles, this matchup is not just about winning - it’s about maintaining competitiveness and chemistry during a tough injury stretch. The absence of LeBron James underscores the importance of depth and adaptability, two elements the Lakers have emphasized since Redick took over as head coach.LeBron James’ recovery timeline remains fluid, though optimism within the organization suggests a return by mid-November. However, the Lakers are unlikely to rush him back given the nature of sciatica and its potential for recurrence.As the team continues to balance immediate results with long-term goals, the next few weeks will serve as a critical test of their resilience. Whether or not LeBron returns within the projected window, the Lakers’ ability to stay afloat in the standings will determine how competitive they remain once their stars are back on the court.Also read: Is Luka Doncic playing tonight vs the Memphis Grizzlies? Latest update on the Los Angeles Lakers star’s injury status (October 31, 2025) In summary, LeBron James remains out for the Los Angeles Lakers due to right-side sciatica, an injury that has delayed his season debut and raised questions about long-term management. The Lakers will face the Memphis Grizzlies without their veteran leader, relying instead on players like Austin Reaves and Anthony Davis to carry the load. With a tentative return expected in mid-November, the team continues to adopt a cautious approach while focusing on maintaining momentum through the early season.","LeBron James has been ruled out of tonight’s game against the Memphis Grizzlies due to persistent irritation on the right side of his sciatic nerve.

How Jannik Sinner can reclaim the World No. 1 ranking

In a stunning upset at the Paris Masters on Tuesday, World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz lost to unseeded Cameron Norrie 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. The defeat opens the door for second-ranked Jannik Sinner to claim the top spot. The defeat to Norrie ended Alcaraz's impressive 17-match winning streak in Masters 1000 events.Alcaraz struggled throughout the match, making 54 unforced errors and winning only 64% of his first-serve points. The Spanish star's frustration was visible as he had an animated discussion with his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero after dropping the second set.""I'm really disappointed about my level,"" Alcaraz admitted after the match. ""I didn't feel well today. A lot of mistakes.""For Norrie, the victory marked his first career win against a top-ranked player. He sealed the match on his second match point when Alcaraz returned his powerful first serve long. This was their first indoor meeting, with Norrie now leading their head-to-head record 3-5.The loss comes as a surprise given Alcaraz's impressive 2025 season, during which he claimed eight titles, including three Masters tournaments and two Grand Slams - the French Open and US Open.Sinner now has a clear path to the number one ranking. He needs to win the Paris Masters to overtake Alcaraz's 11,250 points.Currently at 10,510 points, Sinner will gain points with each win - reaching 11,500 if he claims the title.The Italian star enters the tournament in good form, riding a 21-match winning streak on indoor hard courts. His last indoor defeat came against Novak Djokovic in the 2023 ATP Finals final. However, his past performance at the Paris Masters has been modest, with just one match win in three previous appearances.The battle for the top spot will continue beyond Paris, with both players facing different challenges at the upcoming ATP Finals, where Sinner defends 1,500 points compared to Alcaraz's 200 points.",World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz loses to Cameron Norrie at the Paris Masters.

World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz suffered a shock early exit at the Paris Masters on Tuesday, crashing out 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 to Britain’s Cameron Norrie after admitting he had “no feeling at all” for the ball during the match. The defeat not only extended Alcaraz’s barren run in Paris — where he has never won the title in five attempts — but also jeopardised his top ranking, with Jannik Sinner now poised to overtake him if he wins the tournament.Returning to competition after a three-week injury layoff, Alcaraz looked rusty and out of rhythm despite a promising start. “I had a lot of good practices here and felt great,” the 22-year-old said after the match. “But today, even in the first set that I won, I felt like I could do much more. I tried to be better in the second set, but it was the opposite. I just felt worse. I had no feeling at all.”Norrie, ranked 31st, capitalised on Alcaraz’s erratic form with a composed and clinical display. The Briton kept his nerve during crucial moments, breaking at 3-3 in the final set before sealing the biggest win of his season. “Such a special win to beat probably the most confident player in the world right now,” Norrie said.“I told myself before the match, even if I get into a winning scenario, I’m not going to be afraid to win. I stayed true to that.”Norrie’s dazzling shot-making drew gasps from the crowd at the La Défense Arena, with Alcaraz even pausing to applaud his opponent’s artistry at times. A perfectly placed lob and a breathtaking passing shot in the opening games summed up Norrie’s fearless approach.For Alcaraz, it was another night of frustration in Paris, reminiscent of his mid-match dips during this year’s Roland Garros before he managed to recover — except this time, there was no comeback. “I’m really disappointed about my level today,” he admitted. “It is what it is.”The loss leaves Alcaraz searching for answers ahead of the ATP Finals, while Norrie moves on to face the winner of the all-family affair between Valentin Vacherot and Arthur Rinderknech. The Briton’s upset has blown the Paris Masters wide open — and left the men’s No. 1 spot hanging by a thread.",Carlos Alcaraz beaten by Cameron Norrie in second round of Paris Masters.

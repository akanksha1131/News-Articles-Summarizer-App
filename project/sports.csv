NEW DELHI: A gritty partnership of over 50 runs for the final wicket between Nathan Lyon and Scott Boland left India exasperated as Australia extended their lead to over 300 runs on day four of the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.In a day packed with enthralling Test cricket, India bowlers had removed Marnus Labuschagne , Mitchell Starc, and Pat Cummins during the final session, raising hopes of starting their chase before stumps.However, Lyon and Boland stood firm, frustrating the Indian bowlers with a resilient stand at the iconic MCG. Their partnership not only defied India but also turned the tide of the match.This marked just the second instance in Test history where a 10th-wicket pair batted for over 50 balls in both innings.The first instance occurred in 1961, when Pakistan’s Afaq Hussain and Haseeb Ahsan faced England in Lahore, lasting 9.2 overs in the first innings and 18.1 overs in the second.Lyon and Boland batted for 8.3 overs in the first innings and a pivotal 17.4 overs in the second.Drama unfolded late in the day when Lyon was caught in the slip cordon by Jasprit Bumrah during the last over. However, replays confirmed it was a no-ball, keeping the partnership intact.Earlier, India seemed on the verge of wrapping up the innings when Ravindra Jadeja bowled a superb delivery, pitching on off stump and turning away to edge Pat Cummins’s bat, dismissing him for a determined 41 off 90 balls. But with the bowlers tiring and the ball softening, Lyon and Boland capitalized on the opportunity to mount a defiant stand.India’s desperation showed as Siraj dropped a caught-and-bowled chance off Lyon and later lost their final review on an unsuccessful lbw appeal. Boland’s cut off Siraj brought up Australia’s 300, while Lyon showcased an array of strokes, including sweeps, lofted shots, and edges that kept the scoreboard ticking.In the day’s final moments, KL Rahul’s tumbling leg-assisted catch off Lyon was overturned due to Bumrah overstepping. Lyon then edged the last ball for a boundary, bringing up the 50-run partnership and closing out a remarkable day of Test cricket on a high for Australia.",Australia extend lead to over 300 runs on day four of the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Sunil Gavaskar clarifies context of 'stupid' remark for Rishabh Pant,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/sunil-gavaskar-clarifies-context-of-stupid-remark-for-rishabh-pant/articleshow/116772617.cms,"Sunil Gavaskar (X Photo)

NEW DELHI: Legendary Sunil Gavaskar on Saturday angrily expressed his disapproval of Rishabh Pant 's shot selection during a critical moment on the third day of the Boxing Day Test .A fuming Gavaskar had slammed Pant for his ramp shot that got him out, labelling it as 'stupid'.For Gavaskar the Pant shot was driven by ego rather than strategic thinking.""When I see somebody as talented as Rishabh Pant play that shot, I had no problem with the first shot he played and missed. The reason I got upset was that ego took over for the next ball,"" Gavaskar told ABC Sport.Gavaskar elaborated on why he found Pant's shot selection particularly frustrating, suggesting Pant was trying to assert dominance rather than playing to the situation.""I've just been hit in the midriff for attempting a similar shot. I'm going to show the bowler who's the boss. Test cricket is not easy. When he got out, they had two fielders in the deep, and this is a big ground. It's not easy to hit sixes. You've got the fielders in catching positions over there—deep square leg and deep fine leg. But he got caught at third man with the edge.""Gavaskar acknowledged Pant's talent and past performances but questioned the need for such a risky shot at that stage of the game.""I've seen him play some fabulous innings. But here in Australia, I get the impression that he thinks that's the only way he's going to score runs. Here he's stepping down the pitch, lofting the ball, and getting a boundary. That's not the way he has scored runs in the past. He has played those shots which have been outrageously good,"" Gavaskar said.Gavaskar highlighted Pant's ability to score runs through conventional cricketing shots, suggesting he should rely on his established strengths rather than attempting high-risk strokes.""I've seen him play the cover drive along the ground very well, the square pull shot he plays so well, the flick off the pads—everything he's got. So, to take a little bit of a risk at that stage was a bit much,"" said Gavaskar.",Sunil Gavaskar criticises Rishabh Pant's shot selection on third day of Boxing Day Test.

NEW DELHI: India opener Yashasvi Jaiswal had a terrible day on the field on Sunday as he dropped three crucial catches of the Australian batters, prompting angered reactions from his skipper Rohit Sharma After having dropped Usman Khawaja on 2 at leg-gully in the morning session, Jaiswal dropped Marnus Labuschagn on 46 at third slip in the second session off Akash Deep.At the stroke of Tea, the 21-year-old then dropped a catch of Pat Cummins off Ravindra Jadeja at silly-point.Of all the three chances, the second dropped catch in particular, saw emotions getting better of Rohit with the skipper seen shouting and throwing his arms around angrily.The animated Rohit reactions to the dropped chances didn't go down well with the commentators with the likes of Mike Hussey suggesting that such things aren't expected from skipper.“I've got to be honest, I don't like that reaction from the Indian skipper. I appreciate he's emotional, and he desperately wants wickets, but you're the one who has to send the message of calm and support. No one means to drop a catch.“He's gonna feel bad enough as it is for putting a catch down, especially someone like Marnus Labuschagne; it happens quickly, it's in, it's out. You don't need to see that as a young player,” Hussey said on Fox Cricket.Australia's women's skipper Alyssa Healy also said that the team needs to be gentle with Jaiswal as he will be key in India's fourth innings chase.“Particularly when you need him to walk out and open the batting alongside you, to make some runs and try and win a Test match for your country,"" she said.Former Australia coach Darren Lehmann also wasn't impressed with Rohit and Virat Kohli's reaction to dropped catches. He however liked Rishabh Pant's gesture which saw him putting arm around Jaiswal, lifting his spirits.""Rishabh Pant did well. He actually gave him a pat on the back and said 'just hang in there, we all drop them'. What he doesn't need is the captain Rohit Sharma and (Virat) Kohli throwing their arms about.

Atalanta kept hold of top spot in Serie A on Saturday after escaping Lazio with a 1-1 draw which kept Inter Milan at bay but ended their club-record league winning streak at 11 matches.Marco Brescianini tapped home into an open goal with two minutes remaining to snatch a point from the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, where a passionate crowd thought a big win was coming their way.Instead Atalanta will end a historic year a point ahead of Inter, who have a game in hand, after the champions briefly drew level on points with a 3-0 win earlier at Cagliari .Europa League holders Atalanta will lead the league even if Napoli beat Venezia on Sunday and draw level on 41 points with Gian Piero Gasperini 's side who have a significantly better goal difference than the 2023 champions.Should two teams finish level at the top of Serie A come the end of the season they will face off in a single match to decide the destination of the Scudetto, which Atalanta have never won.""We struggled for long periods in the first half, but we were much better in the second,"" said Atalanta coach Gasperini.""This year has been the best year in Atalanta's history, let's hope we can make 2025 the same.""Atalanta showed great character to battle back from Fisayo Dele-Bashiru's 27th-minute goal which came in an intense opening period from Lazio.The away side were initially blitzed by Lazio, with Marco Carnesecchi making two sensational stops before Matteo Guendouzi curled a great strike off the post in the 11th minute.But as the match wore on, Atalanta, who were without injured star striker Mateo Retegui, grew into the game and deservedly drew level in front of a boisterous and hostile crowd in the Italian capital.Brescianini netted his third goal of the season thanks largely to Ademola Lookman, who made up for earlier missing from yards out by beating Lazio's offside trap, meeting Nicolo Zaniolo's hooked pass and rolling across to his teammate to salvage a precious point.Next up, Atalanta travel to play the Italian Super Cup in Saudi Arabia, where they will face Inter on Thursday.Lautaro Martinez ended an eight-match scoring drought at Cagliari, netting the second in an engaging contest in Sardinia which Inter won with second-half goals from the Argentina striker, Alessandro Bastoni and Hakan Calhanoglu.Inter have won their last five in Italy's top flight, scoring 19 and conceding just once, a burst in form which has re-established Inter as favourites to retain the Scudetto.The only thing missing for Inter were goals from captain Martinez, who hadn't scored since November 3 before he prodded home Nicolo Barella's cross in the 71st minute on Saturday.""The most important thing is that Inter win. If I get a goal too, then that's a bonus,"" said Martinez.""We work hard every day to win trophies and anyone who sets foot on the pitch will give their all for the team. We've just got to keep going and make 2025 like this year.""Inter could have won by an even more convincing margin had captain Martinez not wasted great chances in each half and Cagliari goalkeeper Simone Scuffet not pulled off superb saves to deny Marcus Thuram and Barella.But Martinez did net his seventh goal this season in all competitions and seven minutes later Calhanoglu made absolutely sure of the points from the penalty spot.Cagliari are just inside the relegation zone after a fourth consecutive defeat for Davide Nicola's side, a point behind Verona and Como who both play on Monday.",Atalanta draw 1-1 with Lazio at Stadio Olimpico in Rome. Marco Brescianini scores late equaliser for Atalanta. Inter Milan beat Cagliari 3-0 to draw level on points.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116757496,imgsize-257872,width-400,resizemode-4/116757496.jpg"

NEW DELHI: 22-year-old Ivory Coast forward Amad Diallo has expressed his determination to ""make history"" with Manchester United despite the club's recent struggles under new manager Ruben Amorim .United have lost five out of Amorim's first 10 games in charge across all competitions, with recent defeats to Wolves, Bournemouth, and Tottenham increasing the pressure on the Portuguese manager ahead of Newcastle's visit to Old Trafford.Despite the team's dismal form, which has seen them languish in 14th place in the Premier League , just eight points above the relegation zone , Diallo has been one of United's few bright spots.He scored a late winner in the recent derby against Manchester City and has contributed two goals and six assists in the league this season.Diallo, along with other young players like Alejandro Garnacho, Kobbie Mainoo, Joshua Zirkzee, and Rasmus Hojlund, has set his sights on taking United back to the top.""We are part of the project, we have so many young players for this club, especially Garna (Alejandro Garnacho), Kobbie (Mainoo), Joshua (Zirkzee), Rasmus (Hojlund), me, we are young players who want to make history for this club,"" Diallo told MUTV.""We want to do our best every game. Sometimes it cannot work, but you can see in the pitch we are very focused to do our best for this club, because we want to bring back this club to the level it was before.""So, for the young lads, we just have to keep going, work hard and the most important thing is to listen to the old men, the old players, learn every day.""We have now a new manager, he likes to work with young players, and he brings a new system, so we just have to follow it and try to do our best every game.""""In football this can happen,"" he added. ""Don't be focused in only one position. Sometimes you can play as a defender, sometimes as a striker. Wherever the manager puts me I'm ready to fight for the team.""I just want to play, right wing, number 10, anywhere. I say to the manager if you need me as a 'keeper I'm ready to do my best, I will fight for the team and for my team-mates.

NEW DELHI: Pep Guardiola has affirmed his commitment to Manchester City , dismissing speculation about his departure amidst the club's recent struggles.Guardiola recently extended his contract for two more years.Despite City's current poor form, Guardiola is determined to remain at the Etihad Stadium. The team has experienced a significant dip in performance, losing nine out of their last thirteen matches.The slump has led to questions about Guardiola's future with the club. Some have suggested he might leave if he can't reverse the team's fortunes.However, Guardiola, who has guided City to six Premier League titles in seven seasons, insisted he remains motivated to turn things around.""I will try, I will keep going. Sometimes you think the bad run will be ended earlier or it would be easier to fix it, but it takes more time,"" he said.""I will not give up. I want to be here. I want to do it and, with the situation that we have, we have to do it.""Of course I want it, everyone wants it. I don't want to disappoint my people in terms of the club, the fans, the people who love this club.""I think all of us in our job want to do it well and please the people. That is undeniable, not a question mark.""The biggest test is to come back again, but we have done that before.""Injuries have significantly hampered City's performance, contributing to their current seventh-place standing in the Premier League. Key players have been sidelined due to various injuries.Rodri, the Ballon d'Or winner, is recovering from a long-term knee injury. Other key players, including Ruben Dias, John Stones, Ederson, Kyle Walker, Jack Grealish, and Matheus Nunes, missed the recent draw against Everton.Even Erling Haaland, typically a prolific goal scorer, has struggled recently. He missed a penalty in the Everton match, extending his recent goal drought.Haaland has scored only once in his last seven games, but Guardiola refused to single him out for criticism. He emphasized his philosophy of not assigning blame to individual players.""I don't have it in my education to start complaining, to point at people. It's happened, it's life, it's football, so let's try it again,"" he said.""That's why we have had success, because always it is never enough, we will try it again and again and again. That's why we won a lot of titles.""Every three days it was a game and win, win, win for many, many months and years. Now we have to do the same when results are not good.""As City prepares to face Leicester City, several players are still recovering from injuries. Guardiola acknowledged the impact of injuries on the team's performance.""Sometimes you have injuries,"" Guardiola said. ""For how many years we were incredibly consistent but now, yes, we're a little bit down and the main reason is having so many important players injured.""But I saw the team spirit, how we trained this week, how focused they are, how they try to practise.""","Guardiola recently extended his contract for two more years.

The strike from Kai Havertz proved decisive as Arsenal secured a 1-0 victory against Ipswich , advancing to second position in the Premier League standings, while Bukayo Saka remained absent after his hamstring injury in the match against Crystal Palace last weekend.Arsenal's win reduced Premier League leaders Liverpool 's advantage to six points on Friday, as they capitalised on Chelsea's unexpected 2-1 loss to Fulham on Thursday to emerge as Liverpool's nearest rivalSaka, meanwhile, might not return until March due.Arsenal's manager opted to position Gabriel Martinelli on the right flank, typically occupied by Saka, whilst maintaining Gabriel Jesus as the central striker following his impressive tally of five goals in the previous two matches.Despite controlling much of the ball, the hosts struggled to create significant opportunities until the last 15 minutes of the contest.Arsenal experienced relief when Havertz scored at 23 minutes, following their previous frustrating 0-0 draw against Everton at the Emirates.Havertz netted his 12th goal of the season by directing Leandro Trossard's low cross into the upper part of the goal. But Jesus's strike with a clever shot through Arijanet Muric's legs from a difficult position was ruled as offside.Despite their well-known effectiveness from set-pieces, Arsenal failed to capitalise on their corner opportunities.Gabriel Magalhaes missed a straightforward chance when his header struck the outside of the post from close range.Ipswich displayed increasing ambition in the latter half, which also provided Arsenal more opportunities to counter-attack.Havertz squandered an excellent opportunity to score his second goal, whilst Muric produced another save from Mikel Merino's effort, ensuring a tense conclusion.Ipswich continue to occupy the penultimate position in the table, with a three-point gap separating them from safety.","Arsenal defeated Ipswich 1-0 in their Premier League clash. Kai Havertz scored the only goal of the game in the 23rd minute. The result moves Arsenal to second in the table, six points behind Liverpool.

Manuel Akanji suggests that the 1-1 stalemate with Everton could potentially initiate a turnaround for the struggling Premier League title holders Manchester City .The outcome on Thursday resulted in City securing just a single victory in their past 13 fixtures across all competitions since October, leaving them trailing league leaders Liverpool by 14 points, with the latter holding an additional match to play.The Swiss defender reflected, ""It felt like a frustrating afternoon but, when you compare it to the other matches, we played really well from the first minute to the last.""""We tried to score a goal, we tried to play offensive football, but they (Everton) basically scored out of nowhere.

Tough Start for Ruud

NEW DELHI: Germany made a strong start on Sunday in defending their United Cup title, with world number two Alexander Zverev and Laura Siegemund securing victory over Brazil, eliminating the South Americans from the mixed-team tournament.Zverev sealed the win with a commanding 6-4, 6-4 performance against Thiago Monteiro, following Siegemund’s gritty 6-3, 1-6, 6-4 triumph over Beatriz Haddad Maia, who is ranked 17th, 63 places above her.The result in Perth knocked Brazil out of group play after an earlier defeat to China.Germany now faces China on Monday, with the winner advancing to the quarter-finals.In Sydney, women’s world number four Jasmine Paolini cruised past Belinda Bencic 6-1, 6-1 in just 57 minutes, ensuring Italy’s victory over Switzerland.Meanwhile, men’s world number six Casper Ruud endured a tough battle against Tomas Machac but couldn’t prevent Norway’s loss to the Czech Republic.Zverev set the tone against Monteiro by breaking serve in the opening game of each set, wrapping up the 80-minute contest without facing significant pressure. It marked an unusual position for Germany, who often relied on deciding mixed doubles matches in last year’s tournament.""This is the first time we've ever been up 2-0,"" Zverev said. ""Last year, I played deciding (mixed doubles) matches every time.""It's nice to have this (tie) in the bag. I'm very happy to be playing for Germany again.""Siegemund battled for over two and a half hours to outlast Haddad Maia.After a dominant first set, the German faltered in the second but regained composure in a tense final set, winning after three consecutive service breaks and sealing the match on her first match point.Paolini’s strong form carried over from her stellar 2024 season, which included runner-up finishes at Roland Garros and Wimbledon. She overpowered Bencic, who is making a comeback after maternity leave.""I played a really good match. Today everything worked really well,"" said Paolini.""I was serving and returning well, and I think that was the key.""Earlier, Flavio Cobolli defeated Dominic Stricker 6-3, 7-6 (6/2), giving Italy an initial lead.Meanwhile, Ruud, the highest-ranked Norwegian in history, faced a grueling match against Machac.

Machac and Muchova capitalized, defeating Viktor Durasovic and Ulrikke Eikeri 6-4, 6-4 to secure the Czech Republic’s win.""You kind of hope that it won't be that tough, but what a way to start the new season,"" said Ruud, who banked 2024 tournament wins at Geneva and Barcelona.""If every match is going to be this tough, it's going to be a tough (season).""Ruud’s concern may grow as he faced nine break points during the match, despite his early control in the third set.","World number two Alexander Zverev and Laura Siegemund secure victory over Brazil.

Naomi Osaka , a four-time Grand Slam champion , has stated that she won't remain in professional tennis if her performance doesn't meet her expectations. The 27-year-old Japanese player is scheduled to compete in the ASB Classic in Auckland on Monday. This marks her return to competition since a back injury forced her out of the China Open in October.During a pre-tournament press conference in Auckland on Sunday, Osaka discussed her 2024 season. She described feeling ""humbled"" by her performance after returning to professional tennis following a nearly 15-month break for the birth of her child. She finished the year ranked 58th.“I don't think I'm the type of player that would hang around.”Osaka addressed her future in the sport. She expressed respect for her fellow players but indicated she wouldn't continue playing if she couldn't maintain a certain ranking.“I have a lot of respect for all the players on tour, but the point of my life that I'm at right now, if I'm not above a certain ranking, I don't see myself playing for a while.”She explained that she would prioritize spending time with her daughter if she couldn't achieve her desired level of performance.“I'd rather spend time with my daughter if I'm not where I think I should be and where I feel like I can be.”Osaka's 2024 season saw a 22-17 win-loss record in singles matches. She reached the quarterfinals in Doha and s-Hertogenbosch.“I think 2024 humbled me, but I also feel like I grew a lot.”Osaka reflected on the challenges and growth she experienced during the 2024 season. She acknowledged the difficulty of not achieving her desired results despite her increased efforts.“I worked way harder than I've ever worked before. So in that, I guess it was very painful to not get the results I wanted, but I feel like I'm growing and learning and I am really excited for this year (2025).”She highlighted some positive moments from the past year, including a memorable match against Iga Swiatek at the French Open , which she lost 7-6, 1-6, 7-5.“I played really good matches. People still talk to me about my Iga (Swiatek) match at the French Open (lost 7-6 1-6 7-5). So I'm glad that I was able to give people memories as well.”Osaka also expressed optimism about her performance before her injury in Beijing, her last tournament of 2024, where she was playing against Coco Gauff . She anticipates playing on hard courts again.“Even though I got injured in Beijing, which was my last tournament, I feel pretty optimistic about how that match would have turned out (against Coco Gauff) and I am excited to play on hardcourt again.”Osaka has won the Australian Open twice (2019 and 2021) and the US Open twice (2018 and 2020). She affirmed her continued passion for tennis despite recent setbacks due to injuries.“I've been playing tennis since I was three, and a huge part of that I owe to my parents, but I never really saw my life doing anything else.”Osaka spoke about her lifelong involvement with tennis, attributing much of it to her parents' influence. She realized her deep love for the sport after exploring other possibilities.“Then, when I sat there and had the opportunity to do other things, I realized that I'd rather be playing tennis.”This realization reinforced her commitment to tennis.“So it was kind of one of those realization moments where you feel like you thought you were forced to do something, but in actuality you very much truly loved it.”Osaka's first-round opponent at the ASB Classic will be Lina Glushko of Israel.",Naomi Osaka is scheduled to compete in the ASB Classic in Auckland on Monday.

NEW DELHI: Tennis star Nick Kyrgios has expressed his strong disapproval of the doping-related charges against top players Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek.As he prepares for his return to the court at the Brisbane International, Kyrgios has not held back in his criticism, labeling the breaches of the sport's anti-doping program as ""disgusting for our sport"".The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) has levelled charges against world No.1 Sinner and former world No.1 Swiatek.Sinner tested positive twice for an anabolic steroid in March but avoided a ban due to the ITIA's determination that he was not at fault. Swiatek, on the other hand, accepted a one-month suspension in November after testing positive for a banned substance.Kyrgios, known for his outspoken nature, has questioned the integrity of the sport, stating that the situation is a ""horrible look"" for tennis.“Two world No.1s both getting done for doping is disgusting for our sport. It’s a horrible look,” Kyrgios said. “Tennis integrity right now, and everyone knows it but no one wants to speak about it, it’s awful.”The Australian has also raised concerns about the handling of Sinner's case, questioning why his team waited several months before taking action after the alleged accidental contamination occurred.“I (pay) my team hundreds and thousands of dollars to be the professionals they are, to make sure that doesn’t happen,” Kyrgios said. “So they knew it happened. Why did they wait five to six months to do anything about it? He kept his team for five months … that doesn’t make sense.""“Someone like me … I would never even in my entire life ever try and dope in this sport,” he said. “Especially going through an injury like I went through, obviously there are things out there that could speed up healing, help me get back to prime level, help my recovery.“There’s so many things out there that are prohibited in our sport that I could have been doing to get me back quicker … (but) that’s just not who I am. I’m always against that.""As Kyrgios prepares for his first tour-level appearance since June 2023, he will face 21-year-old Giovanni Perricard of France in the first round in Brisbane. His return to the court will be closely watched, as he aims to make a successful comeback after being sidelined by career-threatening wrist and knee injuries.","Tennis star Nick Kyrgios has expressed his strong disapproval of the doping- related charges against top players Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek.

Djokovic needs one more Grand Slam trophy for an unprecedented 25th crown, surpassing Margaret Court's 24, and the legend from Serbia is optimistic about achieving it in 2025, beginning his quest with the Australian Open in January.He will begin the season with the Brisbane International starting this week, which will also feature world number one Aryna Sabalenka leading the women' field.This season marks a significant shift as it's the first time in 37-year-old Djokovic's career where none of his traditional 'Big Four' rivals will compete, following the departures of Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray this year. Roger Federer announced his retirement in 2022.Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner decided to skip preparatory tournaments before the year's first major championship, the Australian Open, which starts on January 12.Based on the standards Djokovic sets, 2024 proved difficult, with no Grand Slam victories and only securing the Olympic gold in Paris, before concluding his season in October.The Brisbane tournament features strong competitors including an in-form Grigor Dimitrov, Holger Rune and Frances Tiafoe. Australian Nick Kyrgios joins the lineup after a lengthy absence, having played just one ATP Tour singles match in two years due to injuries.Djokovic will also be seen in men's doubles, partnering Kyrgios.On the women's side of the competition, there are American stars Jessica Pegula and Emma Navarro, ranked seventh and eighth respectively. The field also features former world number two Ons Jabeur and the experienced Victoria Azarenka.World No. 1 Sabalenka, who defeated China's rising star Zheng Qinwen in this year's Melbourne final, experienced an outstanding 2024, culminating in her recognition as WTA Player of the Year this month.The accomplished tennis player, aged 26, demonstrated remarkable success by reaching seven finals and securing four championships, including a successful defence of her Australian Open title, clinching her maiden US Open victory, and winning WTA 1000 tournaments in Cincinnati and Wuhan.She managed to regain the top world ranking from Swiatek, the five-time Grand Slam winner, whose standing faced scrutiny in November when reports emerged about her positive test for prohibited cardiac medication in August.The International Tennis Integrity Agency determined that the breach was unintentional, resulting in a minimal one-month penalty for the Polish athlete.The situation mirrors that of Australian Open champion Sinner, who awaits the World Anti-Doping Agency's verdict regarding his earlier clearance after two positive tests for clostebol traces in March.","Novak Djokovic needs one more Grand Slam trophy for an unprecedented 25th crown, surpassing Margaret Court's 24.

""Earlier, there were just government centres with a huge number of kids. But private centres are smaller and more focused,"" said Malik.With the Haryana youngsters impressing at various levels, their progress will be closely monitored. The likes of Anmol, 17, and Unnati amongst others will be in focus as India look to carry on the legacy of Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu ""If these girls can continue with the kind of passion they have now, they can be the next Sindhu and Saina (Nehwal).

Of the six Indian men ranked inside the top 50 in the BWF rankings, only Satish Kumar Karunakaran, ranked 45, is competing, while Anupama Upadhyaya (ranked 46) and Aakarshi Kashyap (47) are the top-ranked women players in fray.As a result, Badminton Association of India (BAI) secretary general Sanjay Mishra recently said the federation in future could make the premier domestic event mandatory.India head coach Pullela Gopichand remarked, ""It’s always a challenge when you want (top) athletes to play two circuits, international and national, or national and state. Ideally, there should be only one calendar,"" he said here Sunday.""…the importance of the national championship has gone down. How do we revive it?"" he questioned.Scheduling is one of the key reasons for top players not featuring in the nationals. With the competition played at the year’s end, it is internationally offseason and an ideal resting period for the players. It is also the phase during which many of them begin preparations for the next season, which starts in early January.With star players focusing on major international events, which offer bigger prize money and ranking points, how can a player be convinced to play in the nationals?""You must give them benefits. Making it mandatory is one way, but they could just come, walk the first day, lose a match and walk off. That’s not the purpose. So, you want them to come here prepared and perform. So, either the prize money needs to be at a point where it is motivating or certain things such as an honour or a facility should be there,"" said Gopi.He also suggested the duration of the competition be reduced to three days.","Head coach feels lucrative prize money & better scheduling could draw top stars. Of the six Indian men ranked inside the top 50 in the BWF rankings, only Satish Kumar Karunakaran is competing. Anupama Upadhyaya (ranked 46) and Aakarshi Kashyap (47) are the top-ranked women players in fray.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116583270,imgsize-27360,width-400,resizemode-4/116583270.jpg"

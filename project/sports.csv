Poll Do you think motherhood has positively impacted Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce's athletic career? Yes, absolutely No, it hasn't

Fraser-Pryce’s career highlights

Three-time Olympic gold medallist

Ten-time world champion

First athlete to win five world titles in a single individual running event

At 35 years, her 2022 win in Eugene made her the oldest woman to be crowned 100m world champion

Her personal best (10.60s) ranks third in the women’s 100m all-time list

Japan is where it all began for Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, and fittingly enough, Japan is where it’s all set to end for the Jamaican, whom many regard as the greatest female sprinter of all time.The upcoming world championships in Tokyo will be Fraser-Pryce’s ninth and final appearance at the biennial showpiece event before she heads into retirement.To get a good measure of how long she’s been around, consider this — Fraser-Pryce, now 38, is just four months younger than Usain Bolt, that other charismatic Jamaican sprint legend, and it’s already eight years since Bolt made his final competitive appearance at the 2017 world championships in London.In fact, around the same time the sporting world was celebrating Bolt’s extraordinary career, there was cause for celebration in the Pryce household too, as Shelly-Ann gave birth to her son Zyon.Motherhood, many thought, meant she was never going to return to elite track competition. The three-time Olympic champion, however, never harboured any doubt that she would. “For me, I ultimately knew that I was coming back.It wasn’t if or maybe. I knew that, and I think resilience is also knowing your power and owning that power,” Fraser-Pryce told reporters during a call this week.“Honestly, I think being a mom has really fuelled me,” she would add.It’s hard to argue against the evidence. After giving birth, Fraser-Pryce has racked up a staggering haul of two Olympic medals, including a gold, and seven world championship medals, including three gold. “I don’t think I’m special, but I definitely think that God is good. And I also think that it’s a mindset.“I’ve never been one to focus on opinions of others, or what people think can happen, or what’s possible or what the norm is. Sometimes greatness happens outside of the norm.“My son is my biggest motivation. I think competing after I’ve had my son, for women, it teaches us that our dreams don’t end when we become mothers. If anything, they add value to our dreams and our goals, what we’re chasing.”And so, a ‘chase’ which began at the 2007 world championships in Osaka, when she was just 20, and only a reserve in Jamaica's 4×100m relay team, is now approaching the finish line in Tokyo. For the 10-time world champion, after the agonising end to her final Olympic Games in Paris last year, this is about settling “unfinished business”.“I think what made it even worse was, I was able to kind of dig myself out of a hole going into Paris. And I felt like that moment was just taken from me,” said Fraser-Pryce who was forced to withdraw from her 100m semifinal after suffering an injury in the warm-up. “I believe I didn’t get the opportunity to really just do what I know I could have done in that moment. And it was hurtful.“It was the first time in my entire career that I’ve never been able to step to a line to compete. And if anyone knows me, it doesn’t matter what’s happening, I’m going to be at the line. And not being able to be at that line to compete was heartbreaking for me. I think it’s the first time in my entire career I’ve had a panic attack.“And that’s really what unfinished business is. Having the opportunity to really end things on my terms, having the opportunity to walk away knowing that I gave everything. That’s what I’m looking forward to.”From leaving her mark in a golden era of sprinting, Fraser-Pryce is already inspiring the next generation of sprinters. Take 15-year-old Italian Kelly Ann Doualla, who recently clocked the fastest under-18 European time ever recorded in the women’s 100m (11.21s), and whose middle name reveals just who the source of inspiration was. “I thought it was only Beyonce people named people after,” Fraser-Pryce quipped when asked if she had heard of Doualla. “It felt inspiring. But I’m like, ‘man, like, that’s definitely showing my age’.“But seeing a young athlete saying that her mom named her after me, it's what it's all about, you know. That's the impact that I want. It's understanding that a young girl who is named after me will always understand what the name carries. And I'm hoping that it continues to show her what's possible.”Elite track and field is bound to miss the colourful presence of the ‘Pocket Rocket’, quite literally thanks to the signature vibrant hairstyles she has sported over the years, but even in retirement, Fraser-Pryce has no plans of easing up. Not even when she goes up against the other moms at her son’s school sports day ‘fun’ sprint races.“Never, I would never do that. It’s not in my DNA to do it,” she laughed heartily when TOI asked her about it. “They know I’m an elite sprinter, but what amazes me is the fact that they actually think they stood a chance.“So, yes, they’re having fun, but I don’t think they understand exactly who I am because I’m like, ‘I’m taking no prisoners’. I do not care if it’s for fun.”",Jamaica's Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce is set to retire after the 2022 world championships in Tokyo. The 38-year-old is the oldest woman to be crowned 100m world champion. She is also the first athlete to win five world titles in a single individual running event. The three-time Olympic champion has won seven world championship medals.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123610494,imgsize-35568,width-400,resizemode-4/shelly-ann-fraser-pryce.jpg"

Sports memorabilia carry immense emotional, cultural, and historical value, often transcending sport itself. Cricket, with its rich heritage, has produced some of the most treasured artefacts ever auctioned. From iconic bats to legendary baggy greens, these prized possessions not only capture unforgettable moments on the field but also command staggering sums under the hammer.In 2020, Shane Warne stunned the cricketing world by auctioning his treasured Baggy Green cap to raise funds for the Australian bushfire appeal. The cap eventually fetched an extraordinary A$1,007,500, bought by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The bank ensured it wasn't locked away but displayed nationwide to raise more money for the cause. Today, the cap rests at the Bradman Museum in Bowral, immortalising Warne's generosity as much as his unmatched spin wizardry.Bradman's first Test cap, worn in the 1928-29 series against England, remains one of the most significant items in cricket history.Symbolising the humble beginning of a career that would later define cricketing greatness, this rare artefact was auctioned in 2020 for nearly A$450,000. Collectors see it as the genesis of “The Don's” incredible journey, from a young debutant to the greatest batsman the sport has ever seen, with an immortal average of 99.94.The National Museum of Australia recently secured a piece of cricket's greatest legacy — Sir Donald Bradman's Baggy Green worn during the 1946–47 Ashes series. The Don amassed 680 runs in that series, averaging a staggering 97.14. Auctioned for A$438,500, this cap is among just 11 Bradman baggy greens known to exist. It represents not only his cricketing genius but also Australia's post-war revival, making it a national treasure beyond monetary value.Bradman's Baggy Green from his farewell tour of England in 1948 — famously known as the “Invincibles” tour — is another priceless relic. It was during this tour that he needed just four runs to secure a Test average of 100 but was bowled for a duck in his final innings. The cap sold in 2003 for £170,000 to a UK-based collector. More than memorabilia, it is a poignant reminder of cricket's most human moment.Few sporting memories stir as much emotion as MS Dhoni's six that sealed India's 2011 World Cup triumph after 28 years. The bat used in that iconic moment was auctioned for £100,000, bought by R K Global Shares & Securities Ltd. At the time, it became the most expensive cricket bat ever sold. Beyond its price, the willow represents national pride, Dhoni's legendary calmness under pressure, and a generation's most cherished sporting memory.Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack is often called the “Bible of Cricket,” and a complete set covering its first 144 editions (1864–2007) was sold for a whopping £84,000 in 2008. The collection included rare index issues, making it highly desirable for cricket historians and collectors alike. Beyond its market value, the Almanack is a time capsule of cricketing history — chronicling the evolution of the game from its early days to the modern professional era.In 1968, Sir Garfield Sobers etched his name into cricket folklore by hitting six consecutive sixes in an over against Glamorgan's Malcolm Nash in a first-class match. The bat that delivered those historic blows was auctioned in 2000, fetching £54,257. For fans, it symbolises the audacity and power of Sobers, arguably cricket's greatest all-rounder. The sale not only honoured the record itself but also preserved the spirit of attacking cricket Sobers embodied.Before Brian Lara broke it decades later, Sobers' monumental 365 against Pakistan in 1958 stood as the highest individual Test score for 36 years. The bat with which he achieved this feat was auctioned in 2000 for £47,475. More than just wood and leather, this willow embodies the brilliance of Sobers' strokeplay and his ability to dominate bowling attacks. For collectors, it remains one of the purest connections to Test cricket's golden records.These jaw-dropping auction figures prove that cricketing history isn't just about numbers on a scorecard. From Bradman to Dhoni to Warne, these artefacts are priceless bridges between generations — symbols of sporting greatness preserved forever.","Sports memorabilia carry immense emotional, cultural, and historical value.

India cricketers eye Test berths with Duleep Trophy | All eyes on Mohammed Shami and other pacers

MUMBAI: Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar 's annual party, postponed after being initially planned in May because of a war-like situation between India and neighbours Pakistan, finally happened at the Mumbai Cricket Association's Bandra-Kurla Complex Recreation Club on Sunday night. Incidentally, it turned out to be the same day when India's Test batting stalwart Cheteshwar Pujara announced his retirement from cricket.Just a day earlier (on August 23), Gavaskar and former ICC, BCCI , and MCA president Sharad Pawar had unveiled a statue of himself at the entrance of the MCA's Sharad Pawar Cricket Museum.Gavaskar's fierce patriotism came to the fore when the invitation card for the party itself mentioned that the event was being held to ""celebrate the success of Operation Sindoor and the performance of the Indian cricket team in England, which has won the hearts of all Indians."" Operation Sindoor was India's substantial response to Pakistan in the wake of the Pahalgam attacks on April 22. While led by a young, debutant captain in Shubman Gill, India, against all expectations, drew a hard-fought series against England 2-2 while playing some thoroughly entertaining and magnificent cricket.On the occasion, Gavaskar didn't forget to remember his old childhood friends who had departed and were a regular feature at his annual event.At the entrance of the hall, Gavaskar remembered all his childhood friends and former Mumbai teammates Milind Rege, Ehsan Hakim, Vijay Karkhanis, Padmakar Shivalkar, Abdul Ismail and his India teammate Dilip Doshi, with their names inscribed on miniature bats.Present on the occasion was former India captain Nari Contractor, who is 91 now. However, three other cricketers of yesteryear who are all in their 90s — ex-India allrounder Chandu Borde, ex-India ‘keeper Chandu Patankar, and former Rajasthan leg-spinner Chandu Joshi — couldn’t make it due to health reasons. Apparently, Joshi started off from Pune for the party, but had to return from Lonavala as he wasn’t feeling well.The guests at the do included Dilip Vengsarkar, India's 1983 World Cup heroes Sandeep Patil and Balwinder Singh Sandhu, former India wicketkeeper and ex-Kolkata Knight Riders and current Madhya Pradesh head coach Chandrakant Pandit, ex-India players Pravin Amre, Raju Kulkarni, Yajurvindra Singh Bilkha and Jatin Paranjape. Ex-India seamer-turned-commentator Irfan Pathan's presence attracted eyeballs too.In a video message, Gavaskar said, “What a wonderful last 10 days it has been! On August 15, which was our 78th Independence Day, it also happened to be my mother's 100th birth anniversary. Our family got together, it was such a fun evening. I'm pretty certain that my parents, my mother, looking from the heavens above, would have also had fun seeing practically the whole family get together to celebrate her 100th birthday. ”“And then a few days later, my statue was unveiled at the Wankhede Stadium, something which I had not even dreamt of when I started playing cricket in the Bhagirathi buildings. And the day after that, we got together to celebrate Operation Sindoor and the young Indian team's performance in England. It was the annual get-together that I generally have for all those whom I have played with right from school, college, club, and Ranji Trophy level, so it was also such a wonderful evening. I can't be thankful enough to God almighty to have the opportunity to have a get-together and celebrate all three occasions with all my family and friends. Normally, it is Milind and Anil Joshi (Gavaskar’s old friend) who organise everything, but this time I’m thankful to Anil for organising the party. We missed Milind Rege, Abdul bhai Ismail, my skipper ‘Papa’ Karkhanis, ‘Paddy’ Shivalkar, and Dilip Doshi. We also missed some others who couldn’t make it.”As usual, Gavaskar's party didn't have any speeches or loud music, just some precious anecdotes that went perfectly with the alcohol and some highly delicious food that was served right through the evening.",Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar held his annual party on Sunday night.

A piece of Australian sporting history has found a permanent home, after a cricket cap worn by Sir Donald Bradman during the 1946-47 Ashes series was bought by the National Museum of Australia in Canberra for AU$438,500 (approx. US$286,700).The federal government covered half the purchase cost, with Arts Minister Tony Burke hailing the acquisition as vital for safeguarding a national treasure.“You’d be hard-pressed to meet an Australian that hasn’t heard of the great Donald Bradman, arguably the greatest cricketer of all time,” Burke said. “Now to have one of his iconic baggy greens in the National Museum of Australia means visitors will have the opportunity to get up close and connect with our sporting and cultural history.”Bradman wore the cap as captain in the 1946-47 Ashes series – the first Test contest between Australia and England after World War II – scoring 680 runs at a staggering average of 97.14 to lead his team to a 3-0 victory. That triumph lit the spark for the 1948 ‘Invincibles’ tour, when Australia went unbeaten in England.The baggy green is one of only 11 of Bradman’s known to exist. Another is housed in the Australian Sports Museum, while the rest remain in private collections.National Museum director Katherine McMahon said the acquisition honours both Bradman’s brilliance and the spirit of resilience he symbolised.“Sir Donald’s baggy green marks the life of Australia’s most celebrated batsman and reflects a time when sporting heroes gave Australians hope, following the heartbreak and hardship of the Second World War,” she said.The cap will now feature in the museum’s Landmarks gallery, joining other national treasures that shaped Australia’s identity.",Bradman wore the cap as captain in the 1946-47 Ashes series.

Paris Olympics 2024: Neeraj Chopra Wins Silver, Pak's Arshad Nadeem Breaks Record | 'Also Our Son'

Two-time Olympic medallist Neeraj Chopra had to settle for a runner-up finish in the Diamond League Final for the third year in a row as Germany’s Julian Weber produced a commanding performance to win his maiden title with two massive 90m-plus throws in Zurich on Thursday.Weber lit up the event with a season world-leading 91.57m effort, also his personal best, coming in the second round. He had already set the tone with 91.37m in his opening attempt, and from there it was a one-man show. None of his rivals came close to the German, whose five legal throws all went beyond 83m, underlining his dominance in the seven-man field.Chopra, meanwhile, had an uncharacteristically modest series. The 27-year-old Indian began with 84.35m and then slipped with efforts of 82m and a foul. At the halfway stage, he was placed third behind Trinidad and Tobago’s Keshorn Walcott. Two more fouls followed before he salvaged his night with a final-round 85.01m to snatch back second place, edging Walcott by just six centimeters. Defending champion Anderson Peters of Grenada finished fourth with 82.06m.“This was not too bad,” Chopra reflected after the event. “We are getting close to the world championships, so I still need to throw a little further.A few things went well, a few things did not. But I am very happy for Julian – he managed to throw really far. Showing 91m was really good.”The modest return was a rare off-day for Chopra, who has made a habit of breaching the 88m mark in recent seasons and famously crossed the 90m barrier earlier this year in Doha. He acknowledged that the focus now shifts to Tokyo, where he will defend his world title next month. “At major championships, the gold is more important than the far throws. So I will try my best to win the medal,” he said.For Weber, it was another breakthrough in a season where he has already thrown over 90m three times, including his 91.06m effort in Doha in May. Thursday’s win also gave him a 3-1 edge over Chopra in head-to-head contests this season, although the Indian still holds a dominant 15-5 overall record.Chopra has not finished outside the top two in any competition since June 2021. But on the biggest Diamond League stage, Weber’s night of brilliance ensured the Indian star had to settle for second best yet again.",Two-time Olympic medallist Neeraj Chopra had to settle for a runner-up finish in the Diamond League Final for the third year in a row.

(Instagram)

Tourism Australia has launched a new version of its ""Come and Say G'day"" campaign specifically targeting the Indian audiences. The new campaign features Sara Tendulkar , daughter of cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar , alongside Ruby the Souvenir Kangaroo, an animated character. It is a $130 million initiative aiming to increase Indian tourists' visit to Australia, capitalising on the market's impressive growth with visitor arrivals exceeding 450,000 and spending reaching $2.7 billion.The new tourism campaign's success builds on strong momentum in the Indian market. Nishant Kashikar, Tourism Australia's country manager for India and the Gulf, reports that Indian visitor numbers are up 8% from last year. Even more impressive is the 21% increase in overnight stays, totalling 29 million nights, and a 14% jump in spending by Indian tourists.Sara Tendulkar's selection as brand ambassador wasn't random. She has a long-standing connection with Australia, having visited the country since childhood. ""Sara has been visiting Australia ever since she was a kid, over the past couple of decades, and therefore, as a result of the trip, she's developed that natural affinity and an emotional connect with Australia,"" explains Kashikar.The 27-year-old Sara Tendulkar brings more than just star power to the role. ""For me, the 'Come and Say G'day' campaign goes beyond tourism. It's about sharing stories of the places that shape you,"" she told NDTV. Her Instagram posts showcase various Australian experiences, including a nostalgic visit to the Melbourne Cricket Ground.Sara's engagement with the campaign reflects her personal philosophy about travel. ""Travel is about discovery, culture, food, and the interesting people you meet along the way,"" she shared.""That's the kind of work I want to keep doing - something that connects people and creates lasting impressions that stay with you long after the holiday.""Tourism Australia sees huge potential in the Indian market. They aim to attract 500,000 Indian visitors by next year. This goal seems achievable given India's position as one of the world's fastest-growing economies and expanding aviation connections between the two countries.","Tourism Australia has launched a new version of its ""Come and Say G'day"" campaign specifically targeting the Indian audiences.

Poll Is it more important for a fast bowler to focus on speed or accuracy? Speed Accuracy Both are equally important

Bengaluru: Mohammed Shami is barely a week away from his 35th birthday and much slower than he once was, but the fire within hasn’t dimmed. Neither has the tenacity to fight. With several of his illustrious teammates having called it a day in recent times, Shami has received many not-so-subtle hints to walk off into the sunset.But the premier fast bowler isn’t throwing in the towel just yet, and as he reiterated just a couple of days ago, “The day I get bored, I will leave. You don’t pick me, don’t play me, I don’t care. But I will keep working hard.”Arguably one of India’s finest pace-bowling exponents, Shami has his focus set on the 2027 50-over World Cup. Mentally, he is all there. The question is, will his body hold up? His last appearance in the ODI format, after all, was in the Champions Trophy final in Dubai in March earlier this year.Playing in his first competitive red-ball game since Nov 2024, the Bengal pacer was slow but not rusty in the Duleep Trophy tie between East and North Zone at the BCCI Centre of Excellence here on Thursday. He bowled 17 overs spread over four spells, focusing more on accuracy rather than speed, on a surface that offered considerable bounce but little seam movement.He was effective but not incisive, looking primarily to test his injury-ravaged body.In his first spell of five overs, his inswingers from good length troubled the right-handers — openers Shubham Khajuria and Ankit Kumar, in particular — while his next spell of three overs was rather uneventful, barring a few edges towards fine leg.Post lunch, Shami switched ends and gears. He appeared to have assessed the conditions to his satisfaction, and his third spell of 4-2-9-0 was his best of the day. Shami was more probing, as he tempted Ayush Badoni and Yash Dhull in the corridor outside off. He finally struck late in the day with a delivery that sent back Sahil Lotra.Shami continued the probing line and in the 70th over, Lotra offered a thick edge to wicketkeeper Kumar Kushagra. The catch was redemption for Kushagra, who had earlier dropped Kanhaiya Wadhwan off Shami. With rain ensuring an early end, it will be interesting to see how Shami and his new-ball partner Mukesh Kumar , who went out for nine overs due to a niggle, fare on a moist surface.","Mohammed Shami played in his first competitive red-ball game since Nov 2024.

What is the Bronco Test?

Former India cricketer Manoj Tiwary has made a striking claim about the introduction of the Bronco Test in Indian cricket, suggesting it could be aimed at keeping Rohit Sharma out of the team. The new fitness benchmark, implemented under India’s strength and conditioning coach Adrian Le Roux, adds to the existing Yo-Yo and 2-kilometre time trial tests that players must meet.Speaking to Crictracker, Tiwary raised questions about the timing and purpose of the test, particularly as India prepares for a transitional phase ahead of the 2027 World Cup. ""I think it will be very difficult to keep Virat Kohli out of the plans for the 2027 World Cup, but I have doubts about Rohit Sharma. I believe the Bronco Test has been introduced for players like him. It seems designed to make it difficult for some senior players to stay in the team,"" Tiwary said.Tiwary also highlighted that Rohit could struggle to re-enter the ODI setup if his fitness standards are not up to the mark. He questioned why the test was introduced at this particular time rather than at the start of the new head coach’s tenure. ""Why now? Who decided to bring in the Bronco Test? It is hard to say, but the observation is that players like Rohit will find it challenging if they do not work hard on their fitness,"" he added.Drawing parallels with past phases in Indian cricket, Tiwary said similar fitness benchmarks have previously sidelined senior players. ""When legends like Gambhir, Sehwag, and Yuvraj were performing well, the Yo-Yo Test was introduced after the 2011 World Cup. Fitness standards have often been used to shape team selection,"" he explained.The Bronco Test is an endurance-focused fitness challenge commonly used in sports like rugby. Unlike the Yo-Yo Test, which allows short recovery breaks, the Bronco Test requires players to complete continuous shuttle runs of 20 metres, 40 metres, and 60 metres, repeated five times without a pause, covering a total of 1,200 metres. Top-level Indian cricketers are expected to complete it in around six minutes.For context, the Yo-Yo Test is a 20-metre shuttle run with increasing speed and ten-second recovery intervals, with a minimum pass mark of 17.1. The 2-kilometre time trial requires fast bowlers to finish in 8 minutes 15 seconds and batters, spinners, and wicketkeepers in 8 minutes 30 seconds.The decision to implement the Bronco Test reportedly followed concerns over endurance levels during India’s recent five-Test tour of England. Among the fast bowlers, only Mohammed Siraj managed to play all five matches, highlighting potential gaps in fitness.",Former India cricketer Manoj Tiwary questions the purpose of the Bronco Test.

NEW DELHI: Former India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has revealed that he has already registered for one of the overseas franchise leagues, days after calling time on his storied Indian Premier League IPL ) career.Ashwin, who announced his IPL retirement through social media earlier this week, ended with 187 wickets in 221 matches across 16 seasons, finishing as the fifth-highest wicket-taker in the tournament’s history. The veteran, who also won the IPL twice with Chennai Super Kings , said his next cricketing chapter will involve playing abroad.“Of course I won’t be playing anywhere and everywhere for 10 months,” Ashwin clarified on his YouTube channel. “Whatever each team’s requirements are and the ones I satisfy, I’ll play in those leagues.

I want to play on the global stage the way I played street cricket,” he said.Beyond cricket, Ashwin emphasised living life on his terms. “My thing is I want to live my life on my terms for my happiness.

Shai Hope's dismissal in the Guyana Amazon Warriors versus Trinbago Knight Riders clash in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) will go down in history as one of the most bizarre dismissals in cricket.Guyana Amazon Warriors' Shai Hope was batting beautifully on 39 off 28 balls, with three crisp boundaries and one six, but then came the brain fade moment for Hope.Trinbago Knight Riders bowler Terrance Hinds bowled a ball well outside the off stump.

Terrance Hinds (2/35) also picked up two crucial wickets, while Mohammad Amir, Andre Russell and Sunil Narine chipped in with a wicket apiece.In the chase, riding on an explosive 116-run opening partnership between Alex Hales (74) and Colin Munro (52), the Knight Riders were on their way to chasing down the total.Warriors' captain Imran Tahir bowled a magical spell of 4 for 27 to bring his team back into the match, but it may be too late as Knight Riders won the match comprehensively by six wickets.","Shai Hope's dismissal in the Guyana Amazon Warriors versus Trinbago Knight Riders clash in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) will go down in history as one of the most bizarre dismissals in cricket.

Poll Should India boycott the Asia Cup match against Pakistan? Yes, I support the boycott No, we should play Undecided

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Manoj Tiwary has sparked a heated debate after calling for India to boycott their highly-anticipated Asia Cup fixture against arch-rivals Pakistan, scheduled for September 14 in Dubai. Tiwary’s comments come in the wake of the April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, where 26 people lost their lives to Pakistan-backed terrorism.Expressing his anger, Tiwary said that he has decided to personally boycott the tournament and urged the Indian team to take a stand as well.“Look, first of all, I am boycotting the Asia Cup personally. I don’t like to see it. And I don’t know who the squad is. And I don’t want to go into that much detail. As I mentioned earlier, I am personally boycotting it. I don’t like to see it because of the kind of environment it has been in, and where people have died in attacks in Pahalgam, we have seen a lot before,” Tiwary told ANI.The former India batter drew parallels with the Pulwama terror attack of 2019, in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. “It happened in Pulwama as well.So when this happens, how can we enjoy the game? This is beyond my understanding. That’s why I am boycotting it personally,” he added.Tiwary also questioned the rationale behind playing Pakistan, pointing out that the ties bring little more than television ratings. “What is the benefit? You have to get TRP; you need revenue? If the ICC people cannot get rid of them, then you get rid of that game. In the other games, you do well. See what happens. This will be a statement from our country,” he asserted.He further underlined the emotional trauma families of martyrs endure when such fixtures are staged. “When we know that these terrorists are coming from our neighbouring country, Pakistan… What is the point of playing with Pakistan? Families who lost their members — in what mindset will they be? When a soldier sacrifices his life, it is not for us to play against the same country from which terrorists come. This should not happen,” Tiwary said.Tiwary’s strong words have once again placed the spotlight on the uneasy intersection of cricket , politics, and national sentiment ahead of the Asia Cup.","Former India cricketer Manoj Tiwary has sparked a heated debate after calling for India to boycott their highly-anticipated Asia Cup fixture against Pakistan.

KOCHI: Batters often talk of being ""in the zone"". It is the state where time seems to slow down, every ball hits the sweet spot of the bat, the pitch appears benign, and bowlers are reduced to mute spectators. Salman Nizar , the 28-year-old from Thalassery was in that ""zone"" during the Kerala Cricket League (KCL) game in Thiruvananthapuram on Saturday.In an electrifying display of brute power and sublime timing, Nizar turned the cricket field into a launch pad, smashing 11 sixes from 14 deliveries that left fans gobsmacked. It wasn’t just hitting, but a masterclass in controlled aggression. The bat sang, the ball soared, and the scoreboard ticked along at a frenetic pace.Coming into bat with Calicut Globstars struggling at 115/6 after 18 overs, Nizar smashed Trivandrum Royals bowler Basil Thampi for five consecutive sixes and kept the strike with a single on the last delivery. What followed was unprecedented.Nizar hammered sixes off every delivery off Abhijith Praveen’s final over, aided by no-balls and wides, to plunder 40 runs. With 71 runs from the last two overs, Calicut raced to 186, with Nizar finishing unbeaten on 86 from just 26 deliveries.The 40 runs Nizar looted off the final over is a new record. He eclipsed the 39 runs Hardik Pandya hit off Akash Sudan in a Baroda vs Delhi Syed Mushtaq T20 game in 2016.Nizar's fireworks were instrumental in Calicut storming to the second spot in this KCL season, notching up a 13-run win over Trivandrum.Incidentally, this was his final KCL game of the season. He leaves for Bengaluru on Sunday for Duleep Trophy.Not surprisingly, he came with a definite game plan.""I had always dreamt of scoring six sixes in an over. I have been working hard at my game ahead of the KCL season. Thankfully, everything just fell in place for me today. I always play to my strengths. Always happy to contribute to the team's win,"" Nizar told reporters after the win.Calicut captain Rohan Kunnummal jokingly remarked: ""We might just lock Nizar up in a room and not allow him to go for Duleep Trophy matches.""His Kerala teammates agree that his ice-cool temperament and the ability to not be overawed by the match situation are his trump cards. Hailing from Thalassery, Nizar loves his biriyani. On Saturday evening, he feasted on Trivandum's bowling.Despite being invited for trials by the Chennai Super Kings ahead of IPL 2025, Nizar was overlooked. Perhaps, this knock may just earn him that plum IPL contract.",Salman Nizar smashed 11 sixes from 14 deliveries in a Kerala Cricket League game.

BENGALURU: Before Thursday, Arshdeep Singh ’s last competitive match was the final of the Indian Premier League, for Punjab Kings against Royal Challengers Bengaluru on June 3. During the recent England series, the left-arm pacer must have fancied his chances of a Test debut, but a left thumb injury sustained during a practice session in Beckenham ahead of the fourth Test in Manchester ruled him out of the series.Turning up for North Zone against East Zone in the Duleep Trophy quarterfinal, the 26-year-old didn't take time to get into match mode. He mixed his lengths well, varied pace, and his deliveries in the corridor outside kept probing the batters.He looked match-ready from the opening delivery; why wouldn't he?Although he warmed the bench in England, where he had a county stint with Kent in 2023, the left-arm pacer used that time judiciously as he topped up his skills.Outlining his routine in England, he explained, ""During the last couple of months with the [Test] team, I trained and bowled a lot and also worked on strength and conditioning.”Arshdeep, who has been waiting for an elusive Test cap, remains focused on achieving it. About staying in the zone and keeping frustration at bay while waiting for his opportunity, he said, ""The training is almost the same. You just put in more work when you are not playing.More overs, strength work and training, so that whenever you get the chance, you are ready and fully fit to go. So, when you are not playing, you try to push the limit. ""It's that mindset which will keep Arshdeep going as he switches formats and turns up for the country in next month's T20 Asia Cup ""During the last Test [Oval], I started training with a white ball. The workload was properly managed. I don't know how many thousands of balls I set down in practice. There was no lack of bowling. At the end of the day, white or red ball, you just play and enjoy it. I got a chance to play here [Duleep] and will next play with a white ball. The aim is to have a lot of overs under the belt,"" remarked Arshdeep, India’s leading wicket-taker in T20Is with 99 scalps.The tour of England has been a huge learning curve for Arshdeep, and he revealed senior pacer Mohammad Siraj's mantra to beat boredom that he learnt during the series.""Mentally, in the last two months, I have learnt how to enjoy the boring time. In red-ball cricket, there is a time when the work gets boring. Like the session after lunch, the ball doesn't do anything... How can you enjoy that? I spoke to Siraj, and he told me that when nothing is happening, how you enjoy that phase will tell you how successful you can be in red-ball cricket. I really liked that tip.""","Arshdeep Singh played for North Zone against East Zone in the Duleep Trophy quarterfinal. The left-arm pacer has been waiting for an elusive Test cap.

During a veterans’ match in Pakistan, a fan created a dramatic moment by breaching security, jumping the barrier, and chasing Babar onto the field. The former captain tried to evade him but was eventually caught. The overzealous supporter hugged Babar before going a step further and planting a forced kiss on him.Security officials rushed in immediately, intervening to separate the fan from the cricketer and escort him away from the ground.The incident highlighted the adoration Babar continues to enjoy, despite his omission from the national squad for the continental tournament in the UAE.Pakistan selectors have excluded both Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan from the T20 squad. While the pair have been consistent performers in the shortest format, neither has featured for Pakistan since December. Head coach Mike Hesson justified their absence by pointing to the good form of other players currently in contention.In their place, all-rounder Salman Agha has been entrusted with the captaincy.

Poll Which departure will be felt the most in IPL 2026? Rahul Dravid Ravichandran Ashwin

The IPL 2026 season is already shaping up to be one of transition, with several high-profile exits and reshuffles across franchises. From coaching changes to player retirements, the off-season has seen some of the league’s biggest names move on. Rajasthan Royals created headlines on Saturday when they confirmed that head coach Rahul Dravid will conclude his tenure ahead of IPL 2026.The announcement marks the end of a relationship that stretches back more than a decade.Dravid first joined the Royals in 2011, captained the side until 2013, and later mentored the franchise in 2014 and 2015. After guiding India to a T20 World Cup win in 2024, he returned as RR’s head coach in 2025 in what was seen as a full-circle moment.In their farewell message, RR noted: “Rahul has been central to the Royals’ journey for many years. His leadership has influenced a generation of players, instilled strong values within the squad, and left an indelible mark on the culture of the franchise.”Meanwhile, Kolkata Knight Riders have also undergone sweeping changes.Head coach Chandrakant Pandit and bowling coach Bharat Arun parted ways with the franchise after a disappointing 2025 campaign that saw KKR finish eighth under Ajinkya Rahane’s captaincy.KKR thanked Pandit for “leading KKR to the IPL Championship in 2024 and helping build a strong, resilient squad.”Former India all-rounder Abhishek Nayar has since been reappointed as assistant coach.Adding to the list of major developments, veteran off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin also announced his retirement from the IPL.The 38-year-old, who was last seen with Chennai Super Kings, confirmed he will now focus on playing in overseas leagues.“Special day and hence a special beginning,” Ashwin wrote on X. “They say every ending will have a new start, my time as an IPL cricketer comes to a close today, but my time as an explorer of the game around various leagues begins today. Would like to thank all the franchisees for all the wonderful memories and relationships over the years and most importantly the @IPL and the @BCCI for what they have given me until now. Look forward to enjoying and making the most of what’s ahead of me. ”With Dravid stepping away from Rajasthan Royals, Pandit and Arun moving on from KKR, and Ashwin bidding farewell to the IPL, the league is undergoing one of its most significant phases of change since its inception.The 2026 season will see not just new faces in the dugouts but also fresh opportunities for emerging players and coaches to define the next chapter of IPL.",IPL 2026 is already shaping up to be one of transition with several high-profile exits and reshuffles across franchises.

MANCHESTER: Manchester United secured a much-needed first win of the season for under-fire manager Ruben Amorim but needed a 97th minute Bruno Fernandes penalty to beat newly-promoted Burnley 3-2. After exiting the League Cup to fourth-tier Grimsby on Wednesday, the Red Devils twice blew the lead at Old Trafford on Saturday.But they were saved in stoppage time when Fernandes, who missed a penalty in last weekend's 1-1 draw at Fulham, scored from the spot after a VAR review for a pull on Amad Diallo.Victory takes United onto four points from their opening three Premier League games and eases the pressure on Amorim ahead of a two-week international break.""I'm not thinking about turning points,"" said Amorim after securing just his eighth win in 30 Premier League games in charge.""I had this conversation with you guys (the media) like 10 times, so it's day by day...we have a lot to do, but we returned a little bit to our level today.""The 20-time English champions had suffered the latest and biggest embarrassment of Amorim's reign in losing to League Two opposition for the first time in the club's history in midweek.The Portuguese coach cast doubt on his future in the aftermath, saying ""something has to change"" and that he would ""think things through"".Amorim dropped goalkeeper Andre Onana after his role in both Grimsby goals, but his replacement Altay Bayindir endured another difficult afternoon.United have been linked with a move for Antwerp's Senne Lammens as a solution to their goalkeeping issues before Monday's transfer deadline.""It's hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment.

Chelsea secured a 2-0 victory over Fulham at Stamford Bridge on Saturday in a match marked by controversial VAR decisions.Fulham faced disappointment when Josh King's potential opening goal was disallowed after VAR review determined Rodrigo Muniz's accidental collision with Trevoh Chalobah constituted a foul.The situation became more frustrating for Fulham manager Marco Silva when Joao Pedro scored for Chelsea after the designated eight minutes of first-half stoppage time had elapsed.Chelsea's second goal came through a VAR-reviewed penalty, awarded when Ryan Sessegnon was deemed to have handled a cross, allowing Enzo Fernandez to score from the spot.""Unbelievable the goal was disallowed. VAR found something unbelievable like a stamp from Rodrigo. For their second goal our players went with the referee to the screen and they were laughing. A stamp on Alex Iwobi, handball from Joao Pedro and the pushing on Joachim (Andersen). Then after the second corner it was already nine minutes of extra-time. The game didn't stop during the eight minutes, so the game should be stopped after the first corner,"" Silva said.Chelsea maintained their unbeaten start to three games following their draw with Crystal Palace and 5-1 victory over West Ham.Argentine winger Alejandro Garnacho attended the match at Stamford Bridge after visiting Chelsea's training ground on Friday to complete his transfer from Manchester United.Chelsea striker Liam Delap left the game within 15 minutes due to a hamstring injury sustained while pursuing a long pass.This injury added to Chelsea's concerns, as Cole Palmer was already sidelined with a groin injury, ruling him out of England's upcoming World Cup qualifiers.Delap's expected absence of six to eight weeks may affect Chelsea's plans to loan Nicolas Jackson to Bayern Munich.The club had already permitted Christopher Nkunku's transfer to AC Milan earlier in the week.""Liam's injury doesn't look good. He was full speed, hamstring, so that requires weeks. When you have two strikers, it's enough. When one of them is injured for weeks, probably it's not enough,"" Maresca added.King appeared to score his first professional goal in the 21st minute after breaking through Chelsea's defence.The 18-year-old forward managed to evade the Chelsea defence and calmly placed the ball past Robert Sanchez.During the build-up, Muniz made contact with Chalobah's foot while turning away from his tackle at the halfway line.Though play continued initially after Chalobah fell, referee Rob Jones reviewed the incident on the pitchside monitor and disallowed the goal for a ""careless challenge.""Silva responded with visible anger, directing his frustration at the fourth official.Substitute Tyrique George, who replaced the injured Delap, nearly scored just before halftime, but Bernd Leno saved his close-range attempt.Chelsea took the lead from the subsequent corner in the ninth minute of stoppage time, as Fernandez's delivery found Pedro, who headed in his second goal of the season.Silva attempted to confront referee Jones at halftime while Fulham supporters expressed their displeasure with chants.The controversy continued in the 56th minute when VAR awarded Chelsea a penalty after Sessegnon blocked Chalobah's cross with his arm away from his body.The decision stood despite reviews of potential fouls by Pedro on Joachim Anderson and a possible handball in the build-up.Fernandez successfully converted the penalty, further intensifying Silva's frustration with the officials.",Chelsea defeated Fulham 2-0 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.

I know we defended deep at times but we are still rusty but we need to build on this win. We need to show more character against Iran,"" Jhingan said in a snap interview.Despite struggling in attack, India's center-backs Anwar and Jhingan stepped up to end India's three-game scoring drought within the first 15 minutes.The team's formation reflected Jamil's tactical approach, with fullbacks Rahul Bheke and Muhammed Uvais Moyikkal initially providing attacking support before adopting a more defensive role.Anwar Ali opened the scoring with a header following Uvais's long throw-in from the left. The goal was awarded to Anwar after a Tajik defender's attempted clearance rebounded off another player into the net.Jhingan doubled India's lead when he capitalized on a rebound after goalkeeper Muhriddin Hasanov partially saved Bheke's powerful header from Anwar's left-footed cross.India's shift to a defensive approach allowed the hosts to gain momentum.

Jamil responded with three substitutions, bringing on Naorem Mahesh Singh, Nikhil Prabhu, and Danish Farooq.India's forwards Vikram Partap Singh and Irfan Yadawad had limited involvement due to the midfield's focus on defensive duties and lack of service.Tajikistan earned a penalty when Vikram Partap Singh fouled Rustam Soirov in the box.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

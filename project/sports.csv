Tempers flared once again at Lord’s on Day 4 of the third Test as Ben Stokes took a pointed dig at KL Rahul , offering him a slow, sarcastic clap late in the final session. It was a direct response to Indian skipper Shubman Gill ’s similar gesture towards Zak Crawley on Saturday, when England appeared to deliberately delay the final over of Day 3. This time, India were on the clock, and it was their turn to eat up time.As Akash Deep was receiving strapping on his right leg with only a couple of overs left in the day, England players appeared visibly frustrated. Sensing déjà vu, Stokes walked over to Rahul and clapped mockingly, making it clear he hadn’t forgotten what happened the previous evening. Back then, Gill had shouted angrily at Crawley for time-wasting and sarcastically applauded him in full view of the umpires.This brewing needle between the sides has added an extra layer to what is already a gripping Test match. At stumps on Day 4, India were 58 for 4 chasing 193. They had just lost Akash Deep, who was cleaned up by Stokes on the last ball of the day, bringing the crowd to its feet and England firmly back in charge.Earlier in the day, India had bowled England out for 192, with Washington Sundar taking 4 for 22 in a terrific spell. Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj also made the most of a spicy surface.With 135 runs needed by India and England requiring six wickets, Day 5 is set up beautifully. But beyond the runs and dismissals, this Test has also become a fierce emotional battle — and it’s far from over.","Ben Stokes took a pointed dig at KL Rahul on Day 4 of the third Test.

Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain in style on Sunday as the 32-team edition of the Club World Cup came to a close. Two goals from main man Cole Palmer and another from their summer signing João Pedro meant that Enzo Maresca's side prevailed in the final.Coming up against a formidable PSG side that were fresh off a thrilling UEFA Champions League final win and a 4-0 demolition of Real Madrid in the Club World Cup semis, the odds were not in favour of the English side.However, an ingenious ploy in midfield and some tactical tweaks saw Chelsea outplay their opponents in the final and comfortably land a 3-0 win at the MetLife Stadium in the United States. While Palmer took center stage for his stunning brace in the first half and the threaded pass to Pedro to make it 3-0, he also made headlines for sporting a rather confused look when his side lifted the trophy.Several clips on social media show the 23-year-old visibly confused as his team celebrated the title on stage. Viral videos showed the player looking puzzled as captain Reece James prepared to lift the trophy.Held as a precursor to the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the United States, several top names were in attendance for the final on Sunday. US President Donald Trump was among the spectators and came up on stage as the victors prepared to lift the cup.However, fans noticed that Palmer did not appear at ease and looked on, bewildered, at the President. He was also seen gesturing to Reece James, as if posing a question about why the official was sharing the stage with them.Clarifying the incident afterwards, Palmer said: “No, I knew he was going to be there, but I didn’t know he was going to be on the stand where we lift the trophy. So, I was a bit confused.”With his crucial brace and assist in the final, Palmer was named Player of the Match.",Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the Club World Cup final.

Palmer, Pedro and Maresca make all the difference

PSG had the ball, but not the goals

A defining moment for Maresca’s Chelsea

“We won the game in the first few minutes,” said Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca after his side beat PSG in the final. Few could disagree. The Blues stunned Paris Saint-Germain with a blistering start and held firm to claim the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup title in dramatic fashion. Enzo Maresca’s men raced to a 3-0 lead well within the first half, with Cole Palmer and João Pedro combining to dismantle the European champions, who had no answer to Chelsea’s attacking football.PSG came into the final on the back of a near-flawless campaign, but it was Chelsea who brought intent and ingenuity to the final.Cole Palmer, who had already played a key role in Chelsea’s Conference League and Premier League campaigns, delivered another performance to remember. The 23-year-old scored twice and assisted once, becoming only the third Chelsea player this century, after Didier Drogba and Eden Hazard, to score multiple goals in a final.His first and second goals were near identical: released down the right, cut inside, placed shot. Both times, PSG keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma could only watch. Both goals saw the PSG high line punished. Palmer also turned creator for João Pedro, threading a perfect through ball that the Brazilian casually dinked over the keeper.Pedro, Chelsea’s summer signing, has now scored in the semifinal and the final, forcing the discussion about whether the Blues have finally found the centre-forward they’ve been searching for since Diego Costa. Excitingly, Pedro—who was brought in to potentially start on the right, drift into the middle, and create space for Palmer—did just that in the final. To say that Chelsea supporters will be on cloud nine following that performance would be an understatement.Enzo Maresca, meanwhile, made decisive tactical changes. He pushed Palmer wider, bolstered midfield control by bringing back club captain Reece James and playing him alongside Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez, which allowed Malo Gusto to push forward. In the end, it was their two goals in ten minutes and three in under half an hour that were the undoing of a PSG side that went through Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Inter Miami to reach the final.Despite enjoying nearly 66% of the ball possession, PSG never truly recovered from the opening blitz. Ousmane Dembélé and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia had flashes of promise but were repeatedly forced wide or backwards. Chelsea’s defensive shape, which at times saw Pedro Neto drop into a back five, frustrated Luis Enrique’s side for long periods.Midway through the second half, PSG did regain some control, but the damage was already done. Chelsea sat deeper, soaked up pressure, and closed out the game with a kind of efficiency rarely seen from such a young side.For PSG, the defeat ends a near-perfect season on a bitter note. Having stormed past Inter Miami and Real Madrid in earlier rounds and lifted both Ligue 1 and the UEFA Champions League, this final was seen as the last title in the bag. But Maresca's men stood firm, thoroughly spoiling PSG’s party and making their midfield play despite being severely inferior in the middle of the park—at least on paper.Chelsea’s run to the final included a shock loss to Flamengo and a tough semifinal against Fluminense. But in the final, there was nothing second-best about their intent. Maresca’s tactics worked flawlessly, his key players delivered, and the Blues have now won their second Club World Cup in four years.With Palmer, João Pedro, and a side that is beginning to show promise and evolve tactically, the Club World Cup might just be the first big step in a new era at Stamford Bridge.","Chelsea beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup final.

But the momentum shifted late in the day when England picked up three wickets in the space of 30 minutes, tilting the balance slightly in their favour.India, however, still have first-innings centurion KL Rahul at the crease, unbeaten on 33.

With the third Test between India and England hanging in the balance at Lord’s, England assistant coach Marcus Trescothick issued a bold warning: “Hopefully we will get six wickets in the first hour tomorrow. ”Chasing a modest but tricky target of 193, India ended a dramatic Day 4 at 58 for 4, still 135 runs away from victory, with just six wickets in hand. KL Rahul held firm on 33 not out, but the late dismissal of nightwatchman Akash Deep by Ben Stokes off the last ball of the day gave England the final word in a day full of twists.Trescothick, addressing the media at stumps, emphasised the momentum shift: “That last hour made it amazing. Everyone was invested, the crowd was behind the team. The buzz around the ground gave the boys a lift.”He stressed the importance of the morning session on Day 5, saying, “It will revolve around the first hour tomorrow. How positive India are, how dominant India will be.” But it was his clear statement of intent that raised eyebrows: “Hopefully we will get six wickets in the first hour tomorrow.”Earlier, England were bowled out for 192 in their second innings, thanks to a brilliant spell from Washington Sundar, who finished with figures of 4/22.Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj chipped in with two wickets apiece, while Akash Deep took one.India’s chase began on a shaky note.

NEW DELHI: India’s chase of 193 for victory took a dramatic turn late on Day 4 at Lord’s as England captain Ben Stokes dismissed nightwatchman Akash Deep off the final ball of the day, leaving the visitors wobbling at 58/4 - still needing 135 runs to win with six wickets in hand.India’s innings began on the back foot after Jofra Archer removed Yashasvi Jaiswal for a seven-ball duck in just the second over. The early breakthrough brought Karun Nair to the crease to join KL Rahul, and the pair cautiously rebuilt under rising pressure.Nair and Rahul added 36 for the second wicket before Brydon Carse injected life into England’s fightback with two big wickets in back-to-back overs. First, he trapped Nair LBW for 14, ending a 33-ball stay. Then he produced a near-perfect delivery to dismiss India captain Shubman Gill, also LBW, for just 6.Rahul, India’s first-innings centurion, remained unbeaten on 33 off 47 balls, holding the innings together with a composed knock that included six boundaries.However, the day belonged to Stokes in the end, as the England skipper struck with the final delivery — castling Akash Deep to put the hosts firmly back in the contest.Earlier, Washington Sundar produced a superb spell of off-spin to claim 4/22 and dismantle England’s middle and lower order. After England had recovered to 154/4 through a 67-run stand between Joe Root (40) and Stokes (33), Sundar dismissed both set batters within 20 runs of each other.Root was bowled behind his legs while attempting a sweep, and Stokes fell attempting an ugly slog that shattered his stumps — prompting a frustrated reaction from the captain. Jamie Smith and Shoaib Bashir also fell to Sundar, while Jasprit Bumrah chipped in with two late wickets, including a searing yorker to dismiss Brydon Carse and a peach to knock over Chris Woakes.England’s second innings folded for 192, setting India 193 to win the Test and take a 2-1 lead in the five-match series.The tense closing stages of Day 4, capped by Stokes’ late strike, have now left the Test hanging on a knife’s edge, setting up a blockbuster Day 5 at the Home of Cricket.","England captain Ben Stokes dismisses nightwatchman Akash Deep off the final ball of the day, leaving the visitors wobbling at 58/4.

Poll Should umpires impose stricter penalties for slow over rates? Definitely Maybe No way

Former England captain Nasser Hussain has lashed out at the alarming slow over rate during the third Test between England and India at Lord’s, calling the delays 'diabolical' and urging umpires to crack down harder on time-wasting.Speaking on Sky Sports, Hussain said: ""They are supposed to bowl those overs by 6 p.m., but we are giving them an extra half an hour and they are still not getting through them. You can still have the pace and interesting cricket we are having, and still come down tough on time wasting. Some of the delays this week, and in general, are diabolical, and I think umpires need to come down strongly on players.""The criticism came after it was revealed that 32 overs were lost over the first three days of play at Lord’s, despite extended playing time. The lack of urgency in the field and frequent stoppages - for drinks, ball changes, and lengthy DRS reviews - have added up, frustrating fans and broadcasters alike.nullStuart Broad, former England pacer, echoed the concern but pointed fingers at cricket’s authorities and umpires for failing to address the problem adequately.""For the players, I don’t think it is a conversation. For umpires, I don’t think it is a conversation; they want strong relationships with the players. The ICC are not pushing the umpires to force it either — but it is a problem for broadcasters, and it’s a problem for the fans. The fans are missing out on overs.""He added, ""If I had bought a day-one ticket for £150 and missed out on Joe Root ’s hundred moment, I’d be slightly annoyed by that.""However, Kumar Sangakkara offered a nuanced take, prioritising the quality of cricket over the quantity of overs.""I stand firmly in the camp that the cricket has been more entertaining than it has ever been… I don’t watch Test cricket thinking it has got to be 90 overs. But yes, it’s ugly when people just meander around.

Jasprit Bumrah and Joe Root react to the Dukes ball drama at Lord's | IND vs ENG

WATCH:

Cricket fans witnessed one of the most dramatic finishes in recent memory as Marple CC lost five wickets in the final over, needing just one run to win, and ended up tying the match against Bramhall CC in the Cheshire County Cricket League on Saturday, July 12.In a gripping 2nd XI clash at the Michael Hibbert Cricket Ground, Marple were cruising towards a comfortable win, chasing Bramhall’s total of 201. With the score at 201/5 in the final over, the equation was simple: one run to win, five wickets in hand. But what followed was nothing short of extraordinary.Josh Patel turned hero for Bramhall, taking four wickets in four balls — a stunning hat-trick followed by an lbw — to suddenly reduce Marple to 201/9. His victims included Andrew Wild, Joel Greasley, Edward Skelton, and Ben Bailey.With two balls remaining, Marple captain James Hirst walked in as the last batter. He tapped his first ball into the off-side and went for the winning run. But Andy Tatton fielded sharply and threw it to wicketkeeper Ed Gray, who completed a clean run-out of non-striker Greg Marsland to tie the game in unbelievable fashion.Only four of the five wickets were captured on video — but the footage, which has since gone viral, captures the chaotic, thrilling nature of grassroots cricket at its best.Earlier, Bramhall’s 201 was built around a gritty 57 from skipper Rishi Kannah. Marple looked in control during their chase thanks to a 119-run stand between Will Darby (73) and James Crisall (54), but Patel’s final over heroics turned the game on its head.The tie earned both teams eight points, along with additional batting and bowling bonus points.","Cricket fans witnessed one of the most dramatic finishes in recent memory.

Poll Do you think Siraj's tactics of riling up the batters were effective? Absolutely effective Somewhat effective Not effective

Another India player was in the opposition opener's face for an animated send-off; there was a little graze of the shoulders, and the fielders converged towards the pitch to celebrate the first wicket of the morning. It seemed like an extension of the last seven minutes on Day 3, only the protagonist had changed.Mohammed Siraj, who was merely a supporting cast to captain Shubman Gill last evening, was in the leading role on a cooler Day 4 morning, where the sun stayed behind the clouds to make conditions pleasant for the visitors. India's bowling pair of Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah were in no mood for pleasantries as they unleashed fury and operated with a lot of fire in the first hour of the day's play. From the Pavilion End, Siraj instantly hit rhythm and found the right length to keep England openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett guessing. The inconsistent bounce, coupled with sharp movement in the air and off the surface, made batting extremely difficult.To start with, Siraj was a bit wide of the batters, but the moment he got the stumps into play, he made them dance to his tunes.He had his tail up, and once he found rhythm, the right-armer became a different beast. To India's delight, it took him just one delivery to shift gears. After that, the skill took over, and the pitch’s variable nature allowed him to dominate the proceedings.The initial couple of overs were enough for England to start exploring unconventional ways of scoring runs. And when Duckett played that scoop off Siraj, it was clear they were anything but comfortable. Siraj was all fired up, didn’t miss an opportunity to rile up the batter, and got his man when the left-hander miscued a pull to Bumrah in the ring.Early success and early momentum meant the intensity increased from both ends. Bumrah kept troubling Crawley and Ollie Pope and was unlucky to return wicketless during his five-over burst. He looked in top rhythm from the Nursery End and was extracting some mean bounce from awkward spots. The odd one would crash into the right-handers, but they survived, despite the false shot percentage being so high.Clueless against Bumrah and rattled by Siraj, it was hard work being an English batter during that period. Siraj picked another one at the stroke of drinks when he trapped Pope in front. There was a discussion before taking the review, but Siraj was “100%” convinced it was crashing into the stumps. Replays confirmed it, and India headed into the first break of the day with momentum on their side.Crawley survived last evening, survived the first hour on Day 4, but fell to the military-medium pace of Nitish Reddy as he couldn’t keep the expansive drive down. Yashasvi Jaiswal, patrolling at gully, completed a sharp catch. It was Reddy’s chance to be in the batter’s face now, as India had thoroughly dominated the session with some aggressive bowling and a lot of assistance from the pitch.Second change, but similar impact. Akash Deep was introduced late but, even after getting tonked by Harry Brook in the previous over, he roared back by disturbing the woodwork. An absolutely shocking attempt to play the sweep off the pacer led to the downfall of the World No. 1 batter. India weren’t complaining, as their plan of keeping Brook rooted to the crease by having wicketkeeper Dhruv Jurel up paid rich dividends.The match continues to be delicately poised, but those sixty minutes of hell at Lord’s will haunt England’s batters for a very long time. As far as India are concerned, they would have surely discussed how much worse it could have been for the hosts in that fiery morning session.","Mohammed Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah were in no mood for pleasantries as they unleashed fury and operated with a lot of fire in the first hour of the day's play.

Poll Should PSG reconsider their strategy after this loss? Yes, major changes needed No, they just had a bad game Only minor adjustments required

Chelsea secured a decisive 3-0 victory against Paris Saint-Germain in the expanded Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey on Sunday, with Cole Palmer scoring twice and assisting João Pedro for another goal in a dominant first-half performance.Palmer netted two similar left-footed goals from inside the penalty area in the 22nd and 30th minutes, showcasing his impressive form this season with 18 goals total. He then provided a precise through pass to João Pedro, who chipped the ball over goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma in the 43rd minute.The match drew a tournament-high crowd of 81,188, including U.S. President Donald Trump, who faced boos during the postgame awards ceremony before presenting the trophy alongside FIFA president Gianni Infantino to Chelsea captain Reece James.The victory marked Chelsea's second Club World Cup title, following their 2021 triumph when the tournament featured seven teams. The Blues earned between $128,435,000 and $153,815,000 in prize money, with the final amount depending on FIFA's undisclosed participation fee.PSG's hopes for a quadruple were dashed, having previously won Ligue 1, the Coupe de France, and their first Champions League title. The defeat marked their worst loss since a 4-1 Champions League setback against Newcastle in October 2023.The game's turning point came in the 22nd minute when goalkeeper Robert Sánchez's long kick was mishandled by Nuno Mendes. Malo Gusto's subsequent shot was blocked by Lucas Beraldo before Palmer capitalized on the rebound.Tensions escalated late in the match when João Neves received a red card in the 84th minute for pulling Marc Cucurella's hair. The game concluded with a confrontation involving PSG coach Luis Enrique and Donnarumma pushing João Pedro near the center circle.""It's a great feeling. Even better because obviously everyone doubted us before the game. The gaffer put a great gameplan out and obviously, he knew where the space was going to be,"" Palmer said after the match.PSG coach Luis Enrique acknowledged Chelsea's superiority through a translator: ""They had a lot of energy. I believe they were actually better than we were.""Chelsea, who finished fourth in the Premier League and won the UEFA Conference League, demonstrated superior energy throughout the match, benefiting from an extra day of rest following their semifinal compared to PSG.PSG entered the match as heavy favorites, having outscored opponents 16-1 in previous matches, but struggled to maintain their defensive record, which had included 436 minutes without conceding before Palmer's opening goal.Palmer, who joined Chelsea from Manchester City two years ago at age 23, continued his exceptional season with another stellar performance. His second goal came from a well-timed run onto Levi Colwill's long ball, followed by a skillful cut inside before finishing.The match featured six yellow cards in addition to the red card, reflecting the intense nature of the competition between these European powerhouses.","Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the Club World Cup final on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: A day after the Indian Super League (ISL) announced it was putting the 2025–26 season on hold due to uncertainty over the renewal of the Master Rights Agreement (MRA), the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Saturday acknowledged the ISL’s importance in the country’s football ecosystem but stressed that it must also abide by the law of the land.The existing MRA between the AIFF and Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), which runs the ISL, is set to expire on December 8 this year—by which time the league would be well into its third month.On Friday, FSDL stated that without a confirmed contractual framework beyond December, it was unable to ""effectively plan, organise, or commercialise the 2025-26 ISL season"" and had decided to put the season on hold.In response, the AIFF issued a statement saying it would make every effort to ensure the league’s continuity, in line with legal obligations.""The AIFF is conscious of the importance of the ISL not only to the football structure in the country, but also to all the clubs, players, support staff, officials and fans, and also recognises the challenges and difficulties posed due to its disruption. At the same time, AIFF respects the law of the land and the direction of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India,"" the federation said in a statement.Acting on a directive from the Supreme Court, the AIFF has been instructed not to finalise any new terms of the MRA with FSDL until the Court delivers its verdict in the case related to the AIFF’s draft constitution.The AIFF clarified that discussions with FSDL had begun in a timely manner and proposals had been exchanged, but further negotiations were paused following the Court’s order.""As per the Master Rights Agreement, the All India Football Federation had, in a timely manner, first initiated the process of requesting negotiations on the terms of a potential renewal with FSDL on November 21, 2024. Thereafter, senior representatives of the AIFF and FSDL convened meetings on February 5, 2025, in New Delhi and subsequently on March 5, 2025, in Mumbai, to discuss the terms of potential renewal of the Master Rights Agreement.""Following these deliberations, a proposal was submitted by FSDL on March 5, 2025, to which, AIFF responded with a counter-proposal on April 21, 2025. Soon after, the AIFF was advised by its legal counsel that during a hearing on April 26, 2025, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India made an observation that the renewal of the Master Rights Agreement should not be done until its order.""""Consequently, based on legal advice, discussions between the AIFF and FSDL, renewal discussions have been in abeyance pending further directions from the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.""Despite the current impasse, the AIFF assured all stakeholders that their interests would be safeguarded and Indian football would remain unaffected.""The AIFF and its stakeholders will take all possible steps, and do all things within their power, to ensure continuity of the ISL in the best interests of Indian football. We request the understanding of all stakeholders in the interim,"" the statement added.FSDL, AIFF’s commercial partner, had signed a 15-year MRA in 2010. Under this agreement, FSDL pays the AIFF Rs 50 crore annually in exchange for broadcasting, managing, and commercialising Indian football, including the national team.This funding has been vital to AIFF’s operational and developmental efforts.FSDL had earlier informed ISL club owners verbally that the next season would not begin until the MRA situation was resolved.According to previous PTI reports, FSDL is also considering the formation of a new holding company to manage the ISL, with ownership divided among participating clubs (60 per cent), FSDL (26 per cent), and AIFF (14 per cent).","The Indian Super League (ISL) announced it was putting the 2025–26 season on hold due to uncertainty over the renewal of the Master Rights Agreement.

A recherché region in India — where cricket has failed to stamp its authority, where it’s commonplace to find a Barcelona or Arsenal motif than one endorsing one of our cricketing stars and where people disregard altitude hindrances to spend the increasingly climate change-affected summers to indulge in the game of football — has finally found its representation on the national stage.The 134th edition of Durand Cup will see participation from the first club from the Himalayan region of Ladakh in 1 Ladakh FC.""It’s a massive opportunity, not just for 1 Ladakh FC but also for the UT of Ladakh to be playing at Durand Cup for the first time ever. A huge thanks to the organisers,"" 1 Ladakh FC co-founder and general secretary of Ladakh Football Association (LFA), Tsering Angmo, told TOI.""We are the team from topmost part of India and Durand Cup is an opportunity for us to bring Ladakh on the Indian football map and use this opportunity to spread the message of awareness on climate change.""""And you will see we will be very unique in how we play football and carry our message to the people of the country,"" she added.Its uniqueness, in fact, is what has made this club – a brainchild of Tsering and former Real Kashmir co-owner Shamim Meraj — a pop-culture phenomenon abroad intertwining Ladakh’s culture, the black-necked crane on the crest, traditional motifs on the jerseys, and Buddhist principles of compassion, with bold social action.Their eco-friendly jerseys, unveiled by the Dalai Lama, have already sold in thousands outside India, especially in Europe.But the opportunity to bring their football from an altitude of 11,500ft-high to the mainland national stage is one that the two-year-old club has cherished since its inception.""Our expectations are very grounded. We like to dream, too, but for now we just want to compete well and give a good show at Durand Cup and then hope for some magic and miracles!"" was how Tsering explained their upcoming sojourn.However, 1 Ladakh FC are not leaving stones unturned in their endeavour to compete with some of the best clubs in the country. The dearth of professionals from the region has led them to recruit 10 footballers from around the country to guide their challenge, along with the Ladakhi players.Former Chennaiyin FC assistant coach, Rajan Mani, will be at the helm of the club with his experience in youth setup, having been a youth coach at Bengaluru FC as well as the ex-head of youth development with the U16 Indian team.""Playing on the mainland, with the huge difference in weather conditions from Ladakh, can be a deterrent to the players’ performance. So, we are taking steps to nullify those effects,"" Tsering explained.Hence, the team will be travelling to Delhi on Friday and undergo a 10-day conditioning camp at IMT Ghaziabad. They will then avoid unnecessary air travel emissions and travel by train to Jamshedpur, the destination of their Group C clashes, and hold a five-day camp in collaboration with Jamshedpur FC , ahead of their Durand Cup opener against Foreign Services Team at JRD Tata Sports Complex on Aug 2.But the very existence of the club, touted ""the greenest club in South Asia"" with its mission to hit net-zero carbon in four years, challenges the status quo. Apart from their goal of eventually playing in the I-League and becoming the first club from Ladakh in India’s top-tiers, it’s their environmental message that makes them the club to watch out for at Durand Cup.""It’s the perfect opportunity for us to amplify our message, and some plans are being worked out on that,"" Tsering agreed.""We will be the team using minimum plastic and have a carbon footprint calculator to measure our carbon footprint. Then we will offset that with measures both back home in Ladakh as well as through our fans all over the country contributing towards offsetting our emissions.""In a world where performance and profits dictate a football club’s trajectory, 1 Ladakh FC is a testimony that sports and sustainability can merge in hopes of a cleaner future.",1 Ladakh FC are the first club from the Himalayan region of Ladakh. The two- year-old club will take part in the 134th edition of Durand Cup.

Jordan Henderson will leave Dutch club Ajax a year before his contract ends, the club announced on Thursday. The 35-year-old joined Ajax in January 2024, just six months after his move from Liverpool to Saudi club Al-Ettifaq, which drew criticism over gay rights concerns.An outspoken advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, Henderson was accused of prioritising money over principles. However, he soon turned the page on the controversy as Ajax named him club captain. He went on to make 57 appearances for the Amsterdam-based side, whose shirt has been worn by legends like Johan Cruyff and Dennis Bergkamp.Henderson played a pivotal role in Ajax’s revival following one of their worst seasons. Under his leadership, the team mounted a serious Eredivisie title challenge. However, despite holding a nine-point lead with five games remaining, Ajax surrendered the advantage and lost the title to rivals PSV Eindhoven.Ajax Technical Director Alex Kroes praised the veteran midfielder, saying, “Jordan was a true captain for us, both on and off the pitch. Through his mentality and leadership qualities, he made a significant contribution to our qualification for the UEFA Champions League.”Henderson’s performances also earned him a surprise recall to Thomas Tuchel’s first England squad in March. Reflecting on his stint in Amsterdam, Henderson said, “To play for this club was an honour in itself. To have the privilege of captaining it was even more so.”He added that he would not be making further comments due to the “tragic events of last week, and the devastating loss of my former teammate Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva,” as quoted by AFP.","Jordan Henderson will leave Dutch club Ajax in January 2024.

The Indian men’s football team dropped to its lowest FIFA ranking in nine years, slipping six places to 133rd in the latest chart released on Thursday. The fall follows back-to-back defeats in June, including a 0-2 loss to Thailand in a friendly on June 4, followed by a 0-1 defeat to lower-ranked Hong Kong in an Asian Cup qualifying match. The disappointing run also saw head coach Manolo Marquez part ways with the All India Football Federation (AIFF).India last had a worse ranking in December 2016, when it was placed 135th. The country's best-ever position in the FIFA rankings was 94, achieved in February 1996.India now holds 1113.22 rating points, down from 1132.03 previously. Among the 46 Asian nations, India sits 24th, with Japan leading the continental standings at 17th in the world.With the loss to Hong Kong seriously denting their hopes of qualifying for the 2027 Asian Cup, nothing seems to be going right for the Indian men’s team . Under Marquez’s brief tenure, the team managed just one win in eight matches , with a solitary victory over the Maldives in March.In 2024 so far, India have played four matches: winning one, drawing one, and losing two. The team’s poor form even prompted the return of former captain and veteran striker Sunil Chhetri, but his inclusion has yet to turn the tide.India’s next international fixture is scheduled for October, when they face Singapore away in the third round of Asian Cup qualifiers.At the top of the FIFA rankings, world champions Argentina lead the 210-nation table, followed by Spain, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and Croatia.","The Indian men’s football team dropped to its lowest FIFA ranking in nine years, slipping six places to 133rd in the latest chart released on Thursday.

How the technology works

Can the visually impaired also enjoy the fun and thrill of a Formula E race? Yes, it’s now possible — thanks to a new initiative by Formula E and Google Cloud: an AI-powered audio race report. This initiative promotes inclusivity and makes motorsport more accessible for blind and visually impaired fans. Google Cloud will work with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) to conduct focus groups and user testing during upcoming race weekends in Berlin and London, with a full rollout planned for Formula E season 12.The project was unveiled by Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds at the Google Cloud Summit in London. It uses Google Cloud’s generative AI technology to create rich, descriptive audio summaries of every E-Prix race. These reports will offer fans a dynamic recap that captures the excitement and key moments of each race, available on demand shortly after the chequered flag.The initiative originated from a Google Cloud Hackathon held during the 2024 London E-Prix. It is being developed in close partnership with RNIB to ensure the final product meets the needs of visually impaired users.Sharing his enthusiasm about the collaboration, Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds said, “At Formula E, we believe the thrill of electric racing should be accessible to everyone. This innovative collaboration with Google Cloud is a fantastic example of how technology can be used for good—creating a brand-new way for blind and visually impaired fans to experience the drama and emotion of our sport. By working closely with the RNIB, we are ensuring this innovation is truly inclusive and fit for purpose, so that no fan is left behind. ”John Abel, Managing Director of Specialised Software at Google Cloud, added, “For too long, the visual nature of racing has been a barrier for fans who are blind or visually impaired. Google Cloud's AI technology will act as a digital storyteller, creating a vivid audio narrative that brings the speed, strategy, and excitement of Formula E to life. We are proud to work alongside a partner like Formula E that shares our passion for using innovation to break down barriers and connect people through shared experiences. ”Sonali Rai, RNIB’s Media, Culture and Immersive Technology Lead, also said, “Audio description transforms how blind and partially sighted motorsport fans can fully engage in enjoying the full racing spectacle—taking in the visceral sounds of cars on the track while feeling the passion of the crowd.”She continued, “RNIB has been working with Formula E and Google Cloud on this AI-powered podcast, which promises to give a full picture of the race in an accessible and engaging way for blind and partially sighted fans. Formula E’s commitment to working directly with the community to develop this technology is exactly the right approach. It sets a fantastic standard in inclusivity for other sports to follow and stay on track with new advances in innovation. ”The audio report is generated through a multi-stage process powered by Google Cloud's AI platform, Vertex AI. Google’s Chirp model accurately transcribes live race commentary. Google’s Gemini models analyze the transcribed commentary along with live timing data and other official race information. The AI identifies key events such as overtakes, incidents, and strategic pit stops and generates an engaging, fact-based race summary.Also Read: Berlin E-Prix: From Oliver Rowland’s World Championship win to Felipe Drugovich’s debut, there’s a lot to look forward to The text is then converted into natural, expressive speech using advanced text-to-speech technology, resulting in a polished audio report ready for distribution.

Sebastien Buemi wins third spot on the podium in Jakarta



Sebastien Buemi’s performance in 2025 Formula E season

Coming as major good news for Envision Racing driver Sebastien Buemi, the removal of a time penalty from the last Jakarta race has landed him on the podium. Buemi is now officially promoted to third place, while Nico Mueller, who had originally celebrated a podium alongside Dan Ticktum and Edoardo Mortara at the Jakarta E-Prix, has been moved to fourth.The five-second penalty initially handed to Sebastien Buemi at the Jakarta E-Prix for contact with Mahindra Racing’s Edoardo Mortara was recently overturned following a FIA hearing. Due to the penalty, Buemi had finished eighth in Round 12 of the Jakarta race in June. However, the reversal has now reshaped the podium — much to Mueller’s disappointment.According to FormulaE.com, additional footage from Envision Racing's roll hoop camera, which was not available at the time the penalty was applied, was reviewed in detail. Buemi had received the penalty for an on-track collision with Mortara.The FIA stated: “The driver of Car 16 (Buemi) argued that the new element shows his overtaking manoeuvre was legitimate, that he was always in control of his car, and that when the slight contact occurred, he was fully alongside Car 48 (Mortara).”They further added: “The driver of Car 48 agreed with the assessment and mentioned he barely felt the contact.Upon careful consideration of the circumstances, the Stewards find that no single party bears whole or predominant responsibility for the collision. Therefore, the Stewards decide to reverse Decision 12. As a result, the penalty (i.e., five-second time penalty and one penalty point) on Car 16 is removed, and no further action will be taken in relation to this collision. ”With this update, Buemi moved to 10th in the Formula E Driver Standings with 63 points. In addition to his newly awarded Jakarta podium, he also has one win this season, in the Monaco E-Prix during Round 7.Also Read: Nico Mueller happy with Jakarta podium but adds, “It could have been even better with Jake” Buemi will now head to Berlin for Rounds 13 and 14 of the Formula E season.

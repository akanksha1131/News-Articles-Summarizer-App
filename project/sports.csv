If it ain’t broke, don’t Gill it

NEW DELHI: Before Shubman Gill took flight to England for the recently concluded Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, there were some doubts, rather apprehensions: whether Gill would be successful as a Test batter in English conditions or if he would prove to be a good captain.Gill answered them - perfectly. He scored 754 runs in five Tests, putting on an exhibition while also proving that he is more than capable of leading the team -- his composure during The Oval Test serves as a fitting example.With the Asia Cup and T20 World Cup the next big events, both to be played in the shortest format of the sport, there have been talks about not only bringing Gill back in the T20 side but also giving him the role of vice captain, as a precursor to succeed Suryakumar Yadav at some point.It is argued, in favour of Gill, that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has always had a tradition of all-format captains and not the split captaincy, as is the case now.Also related is the rationale of brand value and commerce. After the retirement of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, two superstars of Indian cricket over the last decade and a half, there is an urge to build the next-gen ""brand"" of Indian Cricket.That Gill has become a major brand and favourite for broadcasters is a fact that not many would deny.While there is no question of Gill's place in One Day Internationals (ODIs), and he could even be the heir to Rohit as the leader of the side; to bring him into the T20 side, currently, however, would appear to be a forced decision rather than a natural one.By any measure, Shubman Gill is a decent T20 player. In 21 T20Is, Gill has scored 578 runs at an average of 30.42. He has also scored them at a strike rate of 139.27.While Gill is a generational batter with a sound technique, he is not a ""hitter"". A batter is someone who tries to score runs with less risk and build their innings. While the hitter is someone who tries to score as many runs on every ball as possible, playing high-risk shots.In T20s, where the value of runs scored quickly is more valuable than preserving wickets, teams across the world have been prioritising ""hitters"" over ""batters"".The Indian team took a long time to adopt this approach, but after the 2024 T20 World Cup, they are the ones spearheading it. The role of anchors - a category appropriate for Gill - has become redundant in modern T20s.In 2021 the percentage of balls attacked by Indian batters was 28.82 per innings, it almost doubled and went up to 43.84 per innings in 2024. Moreover, the number of attacking runs per innings also increased to 138.85 in 2024 from 98.64 in 2021.Gill's scoring rate of 139.27 is by no means bad. However, the current Indian top-order scores sit at a much higher strike rate.Playing what coach Gautam Gambhir described as ""high-risk, high-reward cricket"", Abhishek Sharma scores at an unreal strike rate of 193.84, his partner-in-crime Sanju Samson strikes at 152.38. While the new number three Tilak Varma scores at 155.07, Surya thrashes opposition bowling at 167.07.After the 2024 T20 World Cup, India’s top three batters have scored at a combined strike rate of 173.1. If Gill’s seven innings at 129.2 are removed from that period, the figure rises to 181.3.Moreover, in the eight innings where he faced 15 or more balls in all T20Is, only thrice has Shubman Gill scored the runs at or over the strike rate of 160. In comparison, Abhishek Sharma has faced more than 15 balls in six innings so far and in five of them, he has struck at 200 or above.While Tilak Varma scored at over 160 strike rate in six out of 15 innings in which he faced 15 or more balls, Suryakumar Yadav hit the ball at over 160 strike rate in 24 out of 40 such innings. Only Sanju Samson falls behind a bit in this context, but even he has scored at an above 160 strike rate in three out of five occasions where he faced 15 or more balls since the start of 2024.The current Indian T20 side is well settled and is reaping results, having won 14 of the 17 matches after the 2024 World Cup. Much of that success comes from an all-out attacking approach by the top-order that matches the demands of modern T20 cricket. Gill’s style of play does not match this template.Since the 2024 World Cup, the new group of hitters and the team management have taken the attacking game to another level. In this short period, India have scored three of their fastest T20I hundreds.If the team management wants a backup opener for Abhishek and Sanju, the right option could be Yashasvi Jaiswal, who has scored at 170.00 in the six matches he has played after the 2024 World Cup.ALSO READ: Devil lies in action: What makes Jasprit Bumrah injury-prone - why his workload management is crucial Indian cricket took far too long to realise that T20 is a game of ""hitters"". It took too long to realise and implement the theory that in T20 games, a specialist T20 batter is far better than an all-format batter who plays an anchor role.That change has finally created a team that can truly represent a country with the world’s most competitive T20 league. Forcing Gill into the T20 side at this moment would be less about cricketing needs and more about fitting a ""star"" into a system that is already firing without him.","Gill scored 754 runs in five Tests, putting on an exhibition while also proving that he is more than capable of leading the team.

Poll What do you think was Bob Simpson's greatest achievement as a cricketer? Leading Australia to the 1987 World Cup Returning from retirement at age 41 Scoring nearly 5,000 Test runs Transforming the team as a full-time coach

Australian cricket has lost one of its great figures with the passing of former captain and coach Bob Simpson at the age of 89. Cricket Australia confirmed the news on Saturday.Simpson was a central figure in the game for decades. He played 62 Tests for Australia between 1957 and 1978, scoring 4,869 runs at an impressive average of 46.81 while also taking 71 wickets. As captain, he led his country in 39 Tests and guided them to 12 victories.In one of the most remarkable chapters of his career, Simpson returned from retirement at the age of 41 to captain a depleted Australian side during the challenging years of World Series Cricket.After hanging up his boots, Simpson went on to become Australia’s first full-time coach. He took charge of a struggling team that had gone four years without a Test series win and turned them into a dominant force.Under his leadership, Australia lifted the 1987 World Cup, won four Ashes series and finally claimed the Frank Worrell Trophy in 1995, ending a 17-year wait for success against the West Indies.Simpson stepped down after the 1996 World Cup but continued to serve Australian cricket as a national selector. His contributions were formally recognised in 2013 when he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.Bob Simpson’s impact went far beyond numbers. He was a leader, a teacher and a pioneer who helped shape the modern Australian team into the powerhouse it became.","Bob Simpson has passed away at the age of 89.

Poll Is Harry Brook the best batter England has ever produced? Yes, absolutely! No, they've produced better players.

Former England fast bowler Stuart Broad has lavished praise on Harry Brook after the batter produced an audacious six in The Hundred. Brook, playing for Northern Superchargers, stunned Headingley with a remarkable shot off his very first ball, prompting Broad to call him potentially “the best batter we’ve ever produced. ”“He might just be the best batter we’ve ever produced you know, Harry Brook. Big shout so I don’t say it lightly,” Broad wrote in a post on X, reacting to the moment that has since gone viral.The incident unfolded right after Michael Pepper’s dismissal when Brook walked in to face Tim Southee. The New Zealand pacer delivered a slower ball on a length outside off, and Brook initially shaped for a reverse hit. At the last moment, though, he changed plans, crouched low, and scooped the ball over wicketkeeper Joe Clarke for six. The shot not only cleared the boundary with surprising ease but also sent Brook tumbling to the ground after connecting.Fans on social media described the strike as “outrageous,” in disbelief at how Brook managed to generate such power while improvising mid-shot. The unconventional stroke added to the growing list of unconventional yet effective shots from the England batter, who has built a reputation for the same.Brook’s innings (an unbeaten 31 from 14 balls) helped the Northern Superchargers post 193 for 5, a total that proved too steep for Birmingham Phoenix as they secured a comfortable 36-run win. The 25-year-old’s ability to conjure unthinkable shots under pressure has already been on display in international cricket, including a viral acrobatic six during the Test series against India.Broad’s post on Brook adds another layer to Brook’s growing stature and the praise he's received, highlighting the excitement around the batter.","Former England fast bowler Stuart Broad has lavished praise on Harry Brook after the batter produced an audacious six in The Hundred.

The Premier League’s first game of the season was marred by an incident of racist abuse directed at Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo during the match against Liverpool at Anfield. Play was halted in the 28th minute after Semenyo reported the abuse, with referee Anthony Taylor speaking to both managers, Arne Slot and Andoni Iraola, before the game resumed.Merseyside Police confirmed that a 47-year-old man was identified and ejected from the stadium following the allegation. “Police said an investigation is underway after the man's identity was confirmed and he was removed from the ground,” the force stated.The reaction on the pitch and in the dugout was one of disappointment and frustration. Bournemouth captain Adam Smith called the incident “unacceptable,” while head coach Iraola said, “It’s a big shame, most of the news will be about this thing. Obviously, it is something that is still a big problem, not just in football. From the Liverpool side, they have identified this person,” as quoted by Sky Sports.The Premier League confirmed the case will be taken further under its anti-discrimination protocol.“Tonight’s match between Liverpool Football Club and AFC Bournemouth was temporarily paused during the first half after a report of discriminatory abuse from the crowd, directed at Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo,” it said in a statement.“The incident at Anfield will now be fully investigated. We offer our full support to the player and both clubs. Racism has no place in our game, or anywhere in society.”Liverpool are expected to impose strict sanctions once investigations are complete. Clubs in the past have banned offenders for racial abuse, and a similar punishment could be enforced in this case.Clips on social media show a fan in a wheelchair engaged in a heated conversation with Semenyo as he came towards the touchline to take a throw-in.

World number one Jannik Sinner continued his dominant hardcourt run by defeating Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-0, 6-2 in the ATP-WTA Cincinnati Open quarter-finals on Thursday, marking his 25th consecutive hardcourt match victory. The Italian champion, who turns 24 on Saturday, dispatched his opponent in just 71 minutes to secure his eighth straight win at this event and 30th victory of the season.Sinner, competing in his first tournament since winning Wimbledon, will face either French qualifier Terence Atmane or Danish seventh seed Holger Rune in the semifinals.""I felt great on the court today, you could see that,"" Sinner said. ""But every day can be different. Let's see what I can do in the semis.""""I served well today, that was the key for me,"" Sinner added. ""I had a small drop in the second set and I'm happy that I broke back. He moves and serves well, he's difficult to play.""Auger-Aliassime struggled throughout the match, losing the first set in under 30 minutes with three double-faults in the final game. Despite breaking Sinner's serve early in the second set, he ultimately succumbed with his eighth double fault on match point.Fifth-seeded Ben Shelton advanced to the quarter-finals by defeating Jiri Lehecka 6-4, 6-4, securing the victory with back-to-back aces.""I'm hungry, I'm in a good rhythm and the body feels good,"" said Shelton, who will next face third-seeded Alexander Zverev, who has won all three of their previous encounters.In women's action, second-seeded Coco Gauff progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over Lucia Bronzetti.""I could have maybe made some more first serves in that second set, but overall, I had a lot of aces and unreturnables,"" said Gauff, the 2023 Cincinnati and US Open champion. ""I'm happy considering where (my serve) was last week. I'm always trying to get better, but also just trying to take the little wins along the way.""""I'm just trying to be happy with where I'm at now, but still doing the things I need to do to improve,"" Gauff added.The American star secured her quarter-final spot by breaking Bronzetti's serve in the final game, as the 61st-ranked Italian hit long after 79 minutes of play.Gauff will face seventh seed Jasmine Paolini, who defeated 2024 Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova 6-1, 6-2. Krejcikova received treatment for a left foot issue during the second set, which visibly affected her movement.""She's a great player and can do anything she wants with the ball,"" Paolini said. ""But I don't think she was at 100% today.""Paolini, who reached both the Roland Garros and Wimbledon finals in 2024, dominated the match by winning seven consecutive games to build a 4-0 lead in the second set.

Former Indian cricketer S Sreesanth has shared his views on Virat Kohli 's aggressive playing style and reflected on his own career experiences during a conversation with sports commentator Padamjeet Sehrawat on his YouTube channel. Sreesanth , who was part of India's 2011 World Cup-winning team alongside Kohli , emphasized that Kohli's aggressive demeanor is essential to his success as a player.Sreesanth expressed his perspective on Kohli's on-field behavior, distinguishing between aggression and passion.""Nothing (on whether he would change anything). What others call aggression, I call it passion. Is Virat Kohli aggressive? No. I think he is obsessed. Virat's aggression, people say, is a lot. I would say if he reduces that aggression, he won't be the same player.""The careers of both cricketers took different paths following the 2011 World Cup victory. Kohli made his Test debut in the West Indies series, while Sreesanth did not participate in that tour.Sreesanth's final Test appearance for India came during the fourth Test against England in 2011, while Kohli's career continued to flourish.During the interview, Sreesanth also addressed the 2008 incident involving himself and Harbhajan Singh , where the latter slapped him after an IPL game in Mohali.The former pacer revealed how this incident affected his family, particularly his daughter's perception of Harbhajan Singh.""When I told my daughter, 'This is Bhajji pa, he's played with me', she straight away said, 'No, no, I won't say hi'. I couldn't understand why. In school, there may have been the odd conversation about it.""Sreesanth elaborated on his attempts to explain the situation to his daughter and his current perspective on the incident.""There are different stories doing the rounds. Then we tried explaining, but she said she still won't talk to him. The next day, when the legends tournament was going on, we explained that he was like our elder brother. I don't think Bhajji pa did that deliberately. It happened in the spur of the moment. It was just a learning experience for both of us.""The incident has since become a significant talking point in Indian cricket history, with Harbhajan Singh previously expressing his desire to erase that moment from his life during an episode of ""Kutti Stories with Ash.""Both Sreesanth and Harbhajan Singh were prominent figures in Indian cricket during their active playing days, contributing to various successes for the national team, including the 2011 World Cup victory.The 42-year-old Sreesanth's international career came to an end shortly after the 2011 World Cup, with his last ODI being the World Cup final and his final Test match coming against England later that year.Throughout the interview, Sreesanth maintained a reflective stance on his career and experiences, indicating that he wouldn't change anything about his journey in cricket, despite the various challenges and controversies he faced.The conversation highlighted the complex dynamics of professional cricket, from on-field aggression to personal relationships between players, and how these aspects continue to influence their lives even after their playing careers.",Former Indian cricketer S Sreesanth has shared his views on Virat Kohli's aggressive playing style.

On Independence Day Gautam Gambhir kept it simple but powerful. Posting a picture with the tricolour, he wrote, “My country, my identity, my life! Jai Hind!🇮🇳” — a message that resonated with fans across India. It was more than a patriotic caption; it was a reflection of a man whose cricketing journey has always been intertwined with the nation’s pride.Now serving as India’s head coach, Gambhir carries the same passion he once showed as an opener. His tenure, which began in July 2024, has already been full of highs, lows and intense scrutiny. In Test cricket, results have been mixed. India has played 15 Tests under him, winning five, losing eight and drawing two.The most recent Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy in England was a thrilling battle — India lost the first and third Tests, bounced back to win the second and final matches, with a high-scoring draw in Manchester sealing a 2-2 series result. It was a contest filled with tense finishes, resilient comebacks and moments that reminded fans of India’s fighting spirit.In white-ball cricket, Gambhir’s impact has been more immediate.India has dominated in T20Is, winning 13 out of 15 games, remaining unbeaten in series. ODIs saw an early stumble with a home series loss to Sri Lanka, but the team rebounded strongly, winning eight consecutive matches and lifting the 2025 Champions Trophy.Gambhir’s leadership style has sometimes drawn criticism for too much chopping and changing, but he remains steadfast in taking responsibility, famously saying, “We lose together, we win together.” For a man who scored 97 in the 2011 World Cup final and 75 in the 2007 T20 World Cup final, that sense of accountability and love for the country is nothing new. His Independence Day post was a reminder that, for him, cricket and patriotism have always gone hand in hand.","Gautam Gambhir's tenure as India's head coach has been full of highs, lows and intense scrutiny. India has played 15 Tests under him, winning five, losing eight and drawing two. In white-ball cricket, India has dominated in T20Is, winning 13 out of 15 games, remaining unbeaten in series.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123314896,imgsize-123194,width-400,resizemode-4/123314896.jpg"

Poll Should Sanju Samson be traded from Rajasthan Royals? Yes, he should be traded No, he should stay

On a night when cricket and Independence Day celebrations came together, Sanju Samson gave fans plenty to cheer. The Kerala star scored a fluent half-century in an exhibition match organised by the Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) at the Greenfield Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram. The timing could not have been better, coming just weeks before India’s squad for the Asia Cup 2025 is announced.The Greenfield lit up on Friday with its brand-new LED floodlights, which were inaugurated through a dazzling laser and music show. The exhibition clash, a curtain-raiser for the Kerala Cricket League Season 2, brought together two local sides. KCA President’s XI, led by Sachin Baby, faced off against KCA Secretary’s XI, which featured Samson.President’s XI posted 184 for 8, built on Rohan Kunnummal’s 29-ball 60 and Abhijith Praveen’s quick 47. Sharafudden was the pick of the bowlers, returning 3 for 25.Chasing, Secretary’s XI got off to a flying start with Vishnu Vinod hammering 69 off just 29 balls. After the early fireworks, Samson anchored the innings with a composed 54 off 36 deliveries. His dismissal with 13 runs still needed created late drama, but Basil Thampi cleared the ropes to secure a thrilling one-wicket win with two balls to spare.While the night was about cricketing joy, off-field developments continue to swirl around Samson. According to a Cricbuzz report, the Rajasthan Royals captain has asked to be traded or released ahead of IPL 2026. Multiple franchises are believed to be in discussions, with RR co-owner Manoj Badale personally leading talks. Although Chennai Super Kings were linked, their reluctance to part with big names like Ravindra Jadeja or Ruturaj Gaikwad has made such a deal unlikely.Shivam Dube’s name has been floated too, but CSK have no plans to release him. This leaves the door open for other franchises who are showing strong interest. There also remains the chance that Samson stays with the Royals if no trade materialises, despite reported differences with the management.For now, Samson’s future remains uncertain, but on the field he continues to remind everyone of his value with knocks like the one at Greenfield.",Sanju Samson scored a fluent half-century in an exhibition match.

Who is Jacob Bethell?

England batter Jacob Bethell is set to create history by becoming England men's cricket team's youngest skipper at age 21, surpassing a record that has remained intact for 136 years.He will captain England's T20 squad in three matches against Ireland in Dublin.The record for England's youngest captain was previously held by Monty Bowden, who led the team at 23 in 1889 during a test match in South Africa, when the appointed captain Aubrey Smith was indisposed due to fever.The Ireland series will not feature several key players, including designated white-ball captain Harry Brook , who will be leading the ODI and T20 matches against South Africa in early September.""Jacob Bethell has impressed with his leadership qualities ever since he has been with the England squads, and the series against Ireland will provide him with the opportunity to further develop those skills on the international stage,"" England men's selector Luke Wright said in a statement on Friday.This captaincy appointment marks swift progress for Bethell, who only made his international debut across all formats last year.The series in Ireland commences on September 17.Jacob Bethell is a talented England cricketer, born in Barbados in 2003, who moved to England as a teenager and rose quickly through the ranks with Warwickshire.A left-handed batting all-rounder known for his aggressive stroke play and useful left-arm spin, he first made waves at the 2022 ICC Under-19 World Cup and debuted for England’s senior side in 2024.Now, at just 21, Bethell is set to captain England’s T20I team against Ireland, putting him on the cusp of breaking a 136-year-old record as the youngest men’s captain in the country’s history.","Jacob Bethell will captain England's T20 squad in three matches against Ireland in Dublin.

NEW DELHI: In 2025, Indian cricket entered a new leadership phase, with three different captains across formats. Ahead of the five-Test series in England, Rohit Sharma announced his retirement from Test cricket, paving the way for Shubman Gill to take over as India’s red-ball skipper. Gill’s first assignment as Test captain came in the high-profile England tour. While Rohit continues to lead the ODI side, Suryakumar Yadav has been entrusted with the T20I captaincy.But has India ever had one captain leading all three formats?The answer is yes — on multiple occasions.Mahendra Singh Dhoni became India’s all-format leader after Anil Kumble retired from Tests in 2008. He captained the team in Tests, ODIs, and T20Is until stepping away from Test cricket on December 30, 2014, after the Boxing Day Test against Australia in Melbourne. Dhoni relinquished the ODI and T20I captaincy on January 4, 2017.Between 2007 and 2018, Dhoni led India in 332 international matches. His record included 178 wins, 120 losses, 6 ties, 15 draws, and 13 no-results. That translated to a win–loss ratio of 1.48 and a win percentage of 53.61%. Overall, factoring in draws and ties, his teams avoided defeat in 59.53% of matches.Virat Kohli became India’s full-time captain in all formats in early 2017 after Dhoni stepped down from limited-overs leadership.He led until the end of the 2021 T20 World Cup in the UAE, where he stepped down from the T20 role. In 2022, the BCCI removed him as ODI captain, and soon after, Kohli resigned from Test captaincy following a 2-1 series defeat to South Africa.From 2013 to 2022, Kohli captained India in 213 matches across formats, securing 135 wins against 60 defeats, along with 3 ties, 4 no-results, and 11 Test draws. His win–loss ratio of 2.25 reflected India’s dominance under his watch, with a win percentage of 63.38% and an overall success rate of 68.93% — one of the highest in Indian cricket history.Rohit Sharma first took over the T20I captaincy after the 2021 T20 World Cup, before also being appointed ODI skipper in January 2022. When Kohli stepped down from the Test role later that year, Rohit became the all-format leader. His tenure saw notable triumphs, including the 2024 T20 World Cup and the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy.Rohit retired from T20Is after the 2024 World Cup victory and stepped away from Test cricket ahead of the 2025 England series.Between 2017 and 2025, he led India in 142 matches, winning 103, losing 33, tying 2, drawing 3, and with just 1 no-result. His win–loss ratio of 3.12 and win percentage of 72.53% make him one of India’s most successful captains, with his teams avoiding defeat in 75.36% of matches.","Mahendra Singh Dhoni became India’s all-format leader after Anil Kumble retired from Tests in 2008.

South Africa captain Aiden Markram confirmed he will continue opening in the T20I team to accommodate more middle-order batters. With the three-match series against Australia tied 1-1, the decider will be played in Cairns on Saturday.Markram enjoyed a strong IPL 2025 as an opener for Lucknow Super Giants, scoring five half-centuries in 13 innings at a strike rate of 148.82. However, he has not crossed fifty in T20Is since October 2022.""Going through our squads and the players that we've got around, we think probably that (opening) is the best fit. We've got some guys in the middle order that are a lot more destructive than I am, and we feel probably it's better off for me and Ricks ( Ryan Rickelton ) to be up top.”“I did it a bit at the IPL and am starting to do it now again at international cricket. It's an exciting role. It's always nice to bat in the powerplay, and the focus is to get the team off to good starts,"" Markram told reporters on Friday.His opening stands with Rickelton in the series have been 12 and 34. While number three Lhuan-dre Pretorius is yet to find form, Dewald Brevis provided a boost with an unbeaten 125 in the second T20I.Markram also provides an off-spin option and has occasionally taken the new ball, including dismissing Travis Head in the second match in Darwin. ""It's very much a feel thing. It's quite a daunting task. You just see the ball flying nowadays, and I'm not so sure I really want to be a bowler.""But there'll be occasions where you feel like the wicket might be on the slower side or might offer something, and you sort of take that punt. The way I try to operate is just go on my gut feel, whatever my gut's telling me in the moment, run with that and back that and reflect on what could have been and what should have been possibly after the game,"" he said.With South Africa having won only one of their last nine bilateral T20I series, including losing the tri-series final to New Zealand, Markram is eager to turn the tide. ""It feels like we are moving in the right direction. The series so far has been good. The bowlers have been pretty good for us.“The previous game made our batters look good, but it was very much an individual performance (Brevis hit an unbeaten 125). So a nice challenge for our batters tomorrow to hopefully click and for them to put on a good score.""","South Africa captain Aiden Markram confirms he will continue opening in the T20I team to accommodate more middle-order batters.

I felt like it was okay at times today – not where I exactly want it to be – but can improve next game,"" Alyssa was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au.During the match, Healy kept wickets for 42 overs and made subtle adjustments to her stance to reduce strain on her joints.""It actually feels really good.

His ban is backdated to 13 September 2023, the date he was provisionally suspended, meaning he has already served two years of his sentence.The 39-year-old, who played 101 first-class matches and 77 List A games, faced charges relating to the 2021 Abu Dhabi T10 Cricket League and attempts to corrupt matches in that tournament.

Cazaly’s Stadium in Cairns will host the high-stakes decider on Saturday as Australia and South Africa head into the 3rd T20I locked at 1-1. After Australia’s dominant win in the opener, the Proteas roared back in style in Darwin, inspired by a record-breaking innings from Dewald Brevis.The 22-year-old smashed an unbeaten 125 off just 56 balls – the highest individual T20I score by a South African – to set up a convincing 53-run win in the second match.Brevis’s blistering knock, featuring 12 fours and eight sixes, rescued his side from a shaky 57 for three and propelled them to 218 for seven. Tristan Stubbs chipped in with 31, while the Proteas’ bowlers, led by teenage pacer Kwena Maphaka (3/57), dismantled Australia for 165 in 17.4 overs.For Australia, the defeat ended a nine-match winning streak in the format and exposed some middle-order fragility. Tim David’s 50 kept them in the chase, but regular wickets derailed momentum.Glenn Maxwell impressed early with the ball, removing South African captain Aiden Markram and Lhuan-dre Pretorius, but his batting dismissal in the middle overs proved a turning point.Heading into the decider, both sides have plenty to play for. Australia will rely on the experience of captain Mitchell Marsh, Travis Head, and Josh Hazlewood, along with the firepower of David and Maxwell, to reclaim control.South Africa, buoyed by Brevis’s heroics, will look to Markram’s leadership and the pace threat of Rabada, Ngidi, and the young Maphaka to seal a rare T20I series win on Australian soil.The tropical Cairns conditions could make batting trickier than in Darwin, putting a premium on disciplined bowling and sharp fielding. With the series in the balance, expect a fierce contest where one individual performance could once again decide the outcome.The Australia vs South Africa 3rd T20I match will be played on Saturday.T he Australia vs South Africa 3rd T20I match will be played at Cazaly's Stadium in Cairns.The Australia vs South Africa 3rd T20I match will begin at 2:45 PM IST.The toss for the Australia vs South Africa 3rd T20I match will take place at 2:15 PM IST.The Australia vs South Africa 3rd T20I match will be telecast on the Star Sports Network.The Australia vs South Africa 3rd T20I match will be streamed live on the JioHotstar app and website.Mitchell Marsh (c), Alex Carey (wk), Travis Head, Cameron Green, Tim David, Glenn Maxwell, Aaron Hardie, Ben Dwarshuis, Sean Abbott, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood, Josh Inglis, Nathan Ellis, Matthew KuhnemannAiden Markram (c), Ryan Rickelton (wk), Rassie van der Dussen, Lhuan-dre Pretorius, Dewald Brevis, Tristan Stubbs, Corbin Bosch, Kagiso Rabada, Nqabayomzi Peter, Kwena Maphaka, Lungi Ngidi, George Linde, Nandre Burger, Senuran Muthusamy, Prenelan Subrayen",Cazaly's Stadium in Cairns will host the high-stakes decider on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: The feeling of winning the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 still hasn’t sunk in. India defeated New Zealand by four wickets in the final to clinch their second ICC Champions Trophy title under Rohit Sharma ’s captaincy, having previously won the tournament in 2013 under MS Dhoni.The celebrations were electric after India sealed the win.On Friday, Independence Day, star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant shared a video on social media capturing the jubilant scenes — from dressing-room banter to a light-hearted exchange with skipper Rohit that caught fans’ attention.In the clip, Pant went around recording reactions from Ravindra Jadeja, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli , Shreyas Iyer, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, and Axar Patel. When he finally reached Rohit, Pant asked, “Bhaiya, ye stump leke kahaan jaa rahe ho?”Rohit, who had announced his retirement from T20Is after leading India to the 2024 T20 World Cup title, replied with a grin: “Kya? Retirement le lu? Har baar jeetenge to har baar thodi retirement leta rahunga?”To this, Pant laughed and said, “Hum to chahte hain khelo.”The 2025 Champions Trophy was Rohit’s second ICC title as captain, following the T20 World Cup triumph in 2024.Rohit and Virat Kohli will next be seen in action during the ODI series against Australia in October, with both stalwarts already preparing for their ODI comebacks.","India beat New Zealand by four wickets to win the ICC Champions Trophy 2025.

Poll What do you admire most about Dhoni? His captaincy and leadership skills His batting and finishing prowess

NEW DELHI: Five years ago, on this day, India’s legendary captain and wicketkeeper MS Dhoni bid farewell to international cricket, drawing the curtains on a career that transformed the landscape of Indian cricket. At exactly 7:29 pm on August 15, 2020, Dhoni stunned the cricketing world with a brief Instagram post: ""Thanks a lot for your support throughout. From 1929 hrs consider me as Retired."" Minutes later, his long-time teammate and friend Suresh Raina joined him in announcing his own retirement, making it a double blow for fans.‘Thala’, skipper, icon, legend, ICC Hall of Famer — Dhoni’s career was a glittering showcase of trophies and milestones. Respected across the globe for his calm demeanour and sharp cricketing mind, he rose from Ranchi’s dusty grounds to become ‘Captain Cool’, redefining leadership in world cricket.In his very first assignment as captain, Dhoni led India to the inaugural T20 World Cup title in 2007. Four years later, he guided the team to the 2011 ICC ODI World Cup triumph, ending a 28-year wait. In 2013, under intense scrutiny, he silenced critics by clinching the Champions Trophy — making him the only captain to win all three major ICC white-ball trophies.Across formats, Dhoni’s numbers underline his greatness: 17,266 international runs, 829 dismissals, and 538 matches for India.His Test career ended quietly after the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne in 2014, having scored 4,876 runs in 90 matches at 38.09, with six centuries and a highest score of 224.His most prolific arena remained ODIs — 10,773 runs in 350 matches at an average of 50.57, including 10 centuries, 73 fifties, and a career-best 183*. In T20Is, he featured in 98 matches, scoring 1,617 runs at 37.60 and a strike rate of 126.13, with two fifties.Five years on, Dhoni’s international career may be over, but his legacy continues. Still turning out for Chennai Super Kings in the IPL, the 44-year-old has aged like fine wine — a leader, a finisher, and an icon whose impact on Indian cricket remains unmatched.","Five years ago, India’s legendary captain and wicketkeeper MS Dhoni bid farewell to international cricket.

Anfield was filled with emotion on Friday night as Liverpool paid a heartfelt tribute to Diogo Jota and his brother, Andre Silva, before their Premier League opener against Bournemouth. It was the first competitive game at the stadium since the two Portuguese footballers tragically lost their lives in a car accident last month.Before kick-off, the entire stadium stood in silence. Fans held up placards to form “DJ20” and “AS30” in two stands, while both sets of players stood arm-in-arm in the centre circle. A large banner in The Kop sent a message of comfort to Jota’s wife, Rute Cardoso, and their three children: “Rute, Dinis, Duarte, Mafalda – Anfield will always be your home. You’ll Never Walk Alone.”Liverpool manager Arne Slot, his staff, and all players wore black armbands. A picture of Jota and Silva appeared on the big screen, while “You’ll Never Walk Alone” rang out with scarves, flags, and banners waving in their memory.The match itself was a rollercoaster. Liverpool took the lead through Hugo Ekitike and Cody Gakpo, but Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo struck twice to level, despite earlier reporting racial abuse from a spectator. Federico Chiesa’s late goal and a stoppage-time strike from Mohamed Salah sealed a 4-2 win for the Reds.The emotion peaked after the final whistle. Salah, who had mimicked one of Jota’s celebrations after scoring, stood in front of The Kop in tears as supporters sang Jota’s name. Slot later described the tribute as “impressive and powerful.”Jota spent five seasons at Liverpool, winning the Premier League , FA Cup, and League Cup.

Liverpool’s Premier League opener against Bournemouth at Anfield had its share of drama on and off the pitch. The match was briefly halted in the first half when Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo reported racial abuse from a spectator.The incident happened in the 28th minute, prompting referee Anthony Taylor to consult both managers, Arne Slot and Andoni Iraola, as well as the captains. After a short pause, play resumed. The Premier League later confirmed the stoppage was due to Semenyo’s complaint.Semenyo, who received strong support from his teammates, stayed on the field and scored both of Bournemouth’s goals in an emotional night. An anti-discrimination message was broadcast at Anfield after the break. The FA described the matter as deeply concerning and pledged to work with officials and authorities to investigate. Police removed a supporter from the stands at half-time.Liverpool eventually won 4-2, with late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah sealing the victory. Semenyo had earlier levelled the score with a stunning solo run after Liverpool’s Hugo Ekitike and Cody Gakpo had put the hosts ahead.The game was played in an atmosphere heavy with emotion as Anfield paid tribute to forward Diogo Jota , who tragically died last month in a car accident alongside his brother, Andre Silva.A giant mosaic with their initials and shirt numbers was displayed, and a banner was unfurled for Jota’s wife and children.Liverpool boss Arne Slot called the tribute “impressive and powerful”.

W hile Barcelona thrilled on their way to winning La Liga last season, scoring 102 goals in the process, coach Hansi Flick accepts this season his team need to improve defensively.With teenager Lamine Yamal and Raphinha shining in attack, the Catalan giants proved an irresistible force as they claimed a domestic treble.However the German coach's high-pressing defensive line sometimes left Barcelona high and dry at the back, even as it made for frequently gripping, end-to-end matches.The team's 7-6 Champions League semi-final aggregate defeat by Inter Milan was a prime example of the risks inherent in their set-up.""For me, it's not always fun, sometimes I really suffer a lot,"" admitted Flick in May after Barca beat rivals Real Madrid 4-3 in a wild Clasico battle to move to the brink of the title.""I'm really happy with what we are doing (in general), and of course, football is a game of making mistakes. Hopefully, we can make things better and make fewer mistakes.""The coach made a pledge before the summer break.""I know that we have to improve (defensively) and we will do it next season,"" vowed Flick.Whether Barca can maintain the same verve in attack is up for debate even before any defensive considerations.Raphinha, 28, had the best season of his career, which will be hard to repeat, while striker Robert Lewandowski turns 37 later in August.Yamal, who has taken former Barca great Lionel Messi's hallowed number 10 shirt, turned 18 in July and is his team's greatest hope in the months and years ahead.While Real Madrid have been able to spend over 172 million euros ($200 million) on new arrivals Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dean Huijsen, Alvaro Carreras and Franco Mastantuono, as well as hiring Xabi Alonso as coach, Barcelona's poor financial state means their activity in the transfer market has been limited.The Catalans believe their youngsters like Yamal, centre-back Pau Cubarsi, 18, and midfielder Pedri, still only 22 despite his experience, will continue to grow and improve.They brought in Marcus Rashford on a season-long loan from Manchester United to try and revive the English attacker's career and reap the benefits of his huge potential, giving Flick more quality to rotate with.Barcelona did make one important permanent signing this summer in Espanyol goalkeeper Joan Garcia, improving arguably the weakest area of their team.Wojciech Szczesny filled in admirably after coming out of retirement to replace the injured veteran Marc-Andre ter Stegen last season, but is expected to take a reserve role behind the new arrival from Barca's city rivals.Garcia is in line to start as Barca kick off their campaign at Mallorca on August 16.Another hope for the champions is that the return to the Spotify Camp Nou strengthens them.While the Olympic Stadium on the city's Montjuic hill has proven a pleasant stand-in for the past two seasons, it lacks the atmosphere and grandeur of Barcelona's traditional home.The Catalans plan to return there for the fourth league game of the season after the first three are on the road, against Valencia on September 13 or 14.However Barca's entry date has been pushed back numerous times, initially planned for November 2024, and there could be further disruption.Regardless, barring disaster Barca will be back there by the time they host Real Madrid in May 2026, with that game potentially decisive in the title race.Given Flick's side started last season as underdogs to Madrid, that they are favourites to retain the title this time around cannot be taken too seriously.The key may be whether Flick is able to set the team up in a sturdier way without losing any of their attacking edge.","Barcelona coach Hansi Flick admits his team need to improve defensively.

Poll Who do you think will win La Liga this season? Barcelona Real Madrid Atletico Madrid Another team

With Real Madrid aiming to wrestle the Spanish title back from champions Barcelona, here's a look at five talking points as the La Liga season begins on Friday.Carlo Ancelotti's Real Madrid were dismantled on a regular basis by rivals Barcelona last season, who triumphed in all four meetings between the sides as well as winning La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the Spanish Super Cup.The Italian departed, to be replaced by former Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso, who has work on his hands to help revive them despite a squad boasting numerous star names including Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior.Madrid were thrashed 4-0 by Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup semi-finals and it remains to be seen how playing in the competition will impact squad fatigue and preparation for the new season.Defenders Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen give Alonso more options than Ancelotti had last season, along with Dani Carvajal's return from a long-term knee injury.However Madrid could be short in midfield after Luka Modric's departure and with Jude Bellingham set to be out until October after shoulder surgery.Barcelona excelled in attack last season and much of that was down to skilful teenage star Lamine Yamal.The Spain international turned 18 in July and has already made over 100 appearances for the club, becoming the Catalans' key player going forward.If Flick's side are to defend their title and push on for more in the Champions League, as they prepare to return to their rebuilt Camp Nou stadium, the winger maintaining his world-class level is essential.Yamal took former Barca all-time great Lionel Messi's number 10 shirt in July and insists he is forging his own path at the club.After helping his country triumph at Euro 2024, Yamal will also have his eye on the 2026 World Cup next summer.If new arrival Marcus Rashford hits the ground running coach Hansi Flick may be able to give Yamal the occasional rest, moving Raphinha over to the right.After a poor end to the previous campaign and a surprise group stage Club World Cup elimination, Diego Simeone's Atletico took action this summer.They brought in playmaker Alex Baena from Villarreal and Real Betis' Johnny Cardoso to provide new midfield impetus, as well as several other new recruits.Long-time Atletico players Angel Correa, Rodrigo De Paul, Saul Niguez depart, among others.Despite the strength of their squad and Simeone's reputation as one of the best coaches in the world -- and the highest paid in Europe -- Atletico have won just three trophies in the last decade, La Liga in 2021 and both the Europa League and the UEFA Super Cup in 2018.Questions over whether Simeone has taken them as far as he can will quickly rear up if things start to go wrong.Spanish midfield maestro Santi Cazorla penned a new one-year deal with Real Oviedo for their return to Spain's top flight after a 24-year absence.It is a miraculous finale for the 40-year-old -- a member of the Spain side that won the 2008 and 2012 Euro titles -- who came close to losing his right leg due to his ankle bone going soft when he was at Arsenal.Former Arsenal playmaker Cazorla had a key role in the team's rise to La Liga, when he re-joined them he initially offered to play for nothing but was obliged under the rules to accept the minimum wage, and in their first match they take on his former side Villarreal.Whether he will be able to have as much of an impact this season is debatable but Cazorla will get a fine send-off at grounds around the country when Oviedo hit the road.Real Sociedad and Sevilla have made new managerial appointments as they try to bounce back from poor 2024-25 campaigns.After seven years at the helm Real's Imanol Alguacil stepped down and has been replaced by reserve team coach Sergio Francisco.Meanwhile Matias Almeyda takes over at a Sevilla side which finished 17th last season and sacked coach Francesco Garcia Pimienta in April.Both clubs have been among the strongest in Spain over the past decade but have fallen from grace.Real Sociedad in particular will have to find a way to move forward after the departure of key midfielder Martin Zubimendi to Arsenal.",Lamine Yamal will be key for Barcelona if they are to defend their title.

Poll Who do you think will win the Premier League title this season? Liverpool Arsenal Manchester City Chelsea

The Premier League is back in action on Friday, with champions Liverpool beginning their title defence at Anfield against Bournemouth. Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea, who finished in the top four last season once again look like the most viable contenders for the title of league champions.Liverpool, coming on the back of a dominant campaign under Arne Slot, have had a busy summer to say the least. Big-money arrivals Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike are expected to spearhead the attack, while Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez bolster the full-back positions.Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez have departed, with Mohamed Salah now surrounded by a very different forward line. The Egyptian's record-breaking season that featured 29 goals and 18 assists will be hard to replicate. But surrounded by younger, more clinical players, his role may evolve. Defensively, they're still on the lookout. Moves for Marc Guéhi and Giovanni Leoni are all but finalised.Arsenal, after painstakingly coming close to the title, have addressed depth and injuries by bringing in Martin Zubimendi, Viktor Gyokeres and Noni Madueke. With several important players missing large parts of last season, Mikel Arteta will hope for a fitter, more consistent campaign.With Gyokeres home, Arteta's men will look to banish the demons of last season, where they made several chances, but failed to convert them into goals.Manchester City, despite the disastrous start to their campaign last season, finished 13 points behind Liverpool in third place. They need to answer questions over their defence despite new signings Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Aït-Nouri and Rayan Cherki.With Rodri facing another setback during the FIFA Club World Cup, City will face the exact same problem that hounded them last season - the link that connects their defence to midfield. With Mateo Kovacic and Phil Foden also sidelined for the immediate future, Pep Guardiola has a gargantuan task at hand - to ensure that they don't stumble in similar fashion this time around.Chelsea, like every other summer in recent memory, has been extremely active in the transfer market. Their fourth place finish last season was made better when they schooled Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final.Their rapid squad overhaul, adding eight major signings including João Pedro and Jamie Gittens are positive signs. Cole Palmer’s sensational year and Moisés Caicedo’s evolving influence in midfield give reason for optimism, yet the constant changes in squad composition may make things difficult.The Londoners lifted the Conference League title last year, but it's high time that they stamp their authority domestically as well. Can they answer the question of success without stability? Only time will tell.While the title may not be their realistic goal, as the new season begins, a bunch of Premier League clubs find themselves in the middle. They're not quite title contenders, but a change in fortune or a headstart may see them compete with the best for European slots. Some are looking for identity, others for a leap forward, and a few for stability.Manchester United have rebuilt their forward line with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha after a goal-starved campaign. But their midfield depth remains thin, with Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro the only senior options. This remains the same set of options that they had in a disappointing campaign. Ruben Amorim's time in charge saw them endure their 'worst' season ever as they finished 15th. With Amorim set to begin his first full season, fans can only hope that they start behaving like a big club - something they've found difficult to do in a few years.Newcastle United begin with uncertainty, given that their star striker Alexander Isak’s future remains in the balance. He scored over a third of their league goals last season, and replacing him mid-window would be a difficult task. Eddie Howe’s side ended last season in strong form and lifted the EFL Cup. New signing Anthony Elanga adds blistering pace, boasting 36.1 km/h last season, but their attacking set-up may not be clear until the window closes. Isak has been linked to Liverpool and a big-money move to the Saudi Pro League as well.Aston Villa have kept changes minimal, adding striker Evann Guessand from Nice. With Morgan Rogers and Youri Tielemans at their best in the middle of the park, Guessand’s presence could sharpen the attack if he slots in at his new club. However, the squad is largely the same as last year’s sixth-place finishers, leaving questions about whether they’ve done enough to push on. Unai Emery will have to make do as his team will also be playing European football for the third season in a row after their sixth place finish last season. While they have a solid team capable of progressing to the knockouts, can they manage to do it without Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio is the question.Tottenham Hotspur have parted ways with Ange Postecoglou and are banking on Thomas Frank to steer them upwards after a season that saw them barely avoid relegation. Frank has powered up the defence with new centre-backs and João Palhinha on loan. Yet with Son Heung-Min gone and James Maddison sidelined, the attack rests on Mohammed Kudus and young prospect Mathys Tel. Can Spurs avoid embarrassment this time around and force a top-half finish? The answer will heavily rest on how well the new boss gets his players to play his game.","Premier League back in action on Friday, with champions Liverpool beginning their title defence at Anfield against Bournemouth.

Poll Do you think the Supreme Court will resolve the ISL crisis effectively? Yes, they will find a solution No, it will take longer

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) will raise the ongoing Indian Super League (ISL) crisis before the Supreme Court when it convenes on Monday, amid growing concern for players, clubs and staff affected by the impasse.The apex court, which has reserved its verdict on the draft AIFF constitution, will hear the matter that day. The deadlock arises from the pending renewal of the Master Rights Agreement (MRA) between Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) and the AIFF, forcing ISL organisers to place the 2025-26 season “on hold” since July 11. Several clubs have since halted operations or stopped paying salaries to players and support staff.“A discussion was held between the legal representatives of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) and the Indian Super League (ISL) clubs, on Thursday, August 14, 2025,” the AIFF said in a statement on X. “It has been agreed by all parties that the concerns of the ISL clubs… and the hardship being felt by the players and other stakeholders will be conveyed to the Hon’ble Supreme Court next week, for its kind consideration.An AIFF source told PTI that they were ready to file a written application if the judges sought one. “Yes, we will be attempting to mention but since judgement is reserved we have to see how the judges take it. If they feel there is merit… they may ask for an application to be filed. The plight of the players, clubs and football need to be brought to their notice,” a club representative told PTI.The move follows a joint appeal last week by all 11 ISL clubs urging the AIFF to present the situation in front of the court, stating that they would take legal action on their own if no steps were taken. Earlier, the AIFF had proposed holding the Super Cup in September to provide competitive matches in the absence of the league.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) will raise the ongoing Indian Super League (ISL) crisis before the Supreme Court when it convenes on Monday.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

McLaren team principal Ian James pens open letter to fans

What’s next in Formula E?

Team Principal Ian James of the departing Formula E team NEOM McLaren has penned an open letter to the fans of the team, marking their departure from the electric motorsport format. Addressing the Papaya Army, James thanked them for their trust and support as the team went on to win two Drivers’ World Championships and two Teams’ World Championships over 103 races in seven seasons.Ian James began the letter saying that he wrote it with “a huge amount of pride, as well as with more than a hint of sadness,” as the team closed the final chapter after seven years of competing in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship.Thanking the fans for their love on social media and at the track, he said, “The team was always blown away by the amount of papaya we saw at circuits across the world, race-in, race-out, right from our very first round as the NEOM McLaren Formula E team. Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

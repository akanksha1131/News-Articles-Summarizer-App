IPL 2025 suspended: What happens next?

‘Bombs Are Coming’: India-Pak Aerial Clash Sparks Panic During IPL; Chilling Video from Dharamsala

The Board of Control for Cricket in India has suspended the Indian Premier League , with 16 games remaining, due to escalating conflict between India and Pakistan, and England has emerged as a potential host for the final stages of the tournament. The BCCI will prioritise hosting the remaining matches in India if security concerns are resolved, but the England and Wales Cricket Board is open to discussions about hosting if approached.ECB chief executive Richard Gould confirmed England would be willing to step in if needed.“We will help our counterparts at the BCCI where we can,” he was quoted as saying by English media outlet Mail Online.The initial postponement is for a week , following consultations with the 10 franchises who expressed concerns about player safety, broadcaster views, and fan sentiments.Former England captain Michael Vaughan suggested completing the IPL in the UK before India's Test series against England begins on June 20.""I wonder if it's possible to finish the IPL in the UK,"" Vaughan wrote on X. ""We have all the venues and the Indian players can then stay on for the Test series… Just a thought?""The timing of the remaining matches presents a significant challenge. Hosting the tournament before India's Test tour would require quick agreements between the BCCI, ECB, and English venues, complicated by ongoing domestic cricket schedules.Another possibility is rescheduling IPL games for September during the Asia Cup window , which is unlikely to proceed.England's schedule includes South Africa white-ball series from September 2 to 14, suggesting the IPL could potentially resume in England afterward, utilising grounds not needed for the County Championship.A potential clash with England's three-match T20 tour of Ireland from September 17-21 is considered less problematic.Devajit Saikia, the BCCI's honorary secretary, confirmed the decision to suspended the league was made after consultation with franchises who ""conveyed the concern and sentiments of their players, and also the views of the broadcaster, sponsors and fans.""The BCCI released a strong statement of national solidarity: ""At this critical juncture, the BCCI stands firmly with the nation. We express our solidarity with the government of India, the armed forces and the people of our country. The Board salutes the bravery, courage, and selfless service of our armed forces, whose heroic efforts under Operation Sindoor continue to protect and inspire the nation, as they lead a resolute response to the recent terrorist attack and the unwarranted aggression by Pakistan's armed forces.""The statement continued: ""While cricket remains a national passion, there is nothing greater than the nation and its sovereignty, integrity, and security of our country. The BCCI remains firmly committed to support all efforts that safeguard India and will always align its decisions in the best interest of the nation.""",The Indian Premier League has been suspended due to security concerns.

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Rohit Sharma’s last press conference as a captain

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma ’s decision to step away from Test cricket has sparked widespread debate, and former cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar didn’t hold back when weighing in.Taking to his official ‘X’ handle, Manjrekar pointed to Rohit’s recent slump and waning fitness as key reasons why the decision made sense.“164 in his last 15 innings. Out of which 10 were at home v Bangladesh & NZ.Average 10.9. With his current fitness levels… Rohit Sharma’s days as Test opener were over. So…” Manjrekar posted, summarising his view with stark clarity.Rohit, 38, officially announced his Test retirement on Wednesday via Instagram. In a brief but heartfelt note, he wrote, “It’s been an absolute honour to represent my country in whites. Thank you for all the love and support over the years.”His exit comes at a time when his place in the Test squad was under scrutiny. With a five-match Test series against England looming and reports of potential leadership changes within the BCCI, the timing of his decision seemed inevitable.While Rohit bows out from the longest format, he remains committed to white-ball cricket. After leading India to T20 World Cup glory in 2024 and retiring from the format, he confirmed that he will continue playing ODIs.Despite finishing with an impressive Test career tally of 4,301 runs, 12 centuries, and a highest score of 212, his recent form had noticeably dipped.In his final nine matches, Rohit averaged just 10.93 and even dropped himself during the Sydney Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Away from the pitch, Rohit also took aim at the current state of cricket commentary in India, calling it “disappointing” in a candid interview.ALSO READ: 'It is very disappointing': Rohit Sharma not happy with Indian commentary standards He criticised the shift in focus from the game to sensationalism, highlighting a growing disconnect between the media and cricket itself.As he moves on from the whites, Rohit’s legacy—especially in white-ball formats—remains firmly intact.",Rohit Sharma announced his Test retirement on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: The 2025 edition of the Indian Premier League took a dramatic and unprecedented turn on Thursday night as the high-stakes clash between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals in Dharamsala was abruptly halted midway due to escalating border tensions between India and Pakistan.With security concerns mounting, the Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI ), in coordination with Indian Railways, swiftly arranged a special train to evacuate players, staff, commentators, and broadcast crew from the region.The BCCI shared visuals of the train journey on IPL’s official social media handles, thanking Indian Railways for their prompt support.“Thank you, @RailMinIndia, for arranging a special Vande Bharat train on such short notice to ferry the players, support staff, commentators, production crew members, and operations staff to New Delhi.

NEW DELHI: The 2025 edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) has been postponed indefinitely, a source within the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed on Friday night.

Overseas players had begun arriving in Dubai on Friday when the news of the postponement surfaced.It is reliably learnt that the Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) did not decline to host the PSL in the UAE. However, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has yet to officially confirm the postponement of PSL 2025.PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi had earlier expressed regret about shifting the matches out of Pakistan. “I regret that our domestic audience and cricket lovers will not be able to watch these matches in Pakistan’s stadiums,” he said. “But as a responsible organisation, it is our duty to prioritise the safety and mental well-being of players and staff.”Naqvi reiterated PCB’s stance on separating politics from sports and called for patience from fans and stakeholders.The PSL had not released a revised schedule after relocating the matches. With the current indefinite suspension, the remainder of the 2025 PSL season hangs in uncertainty.","The 2025 edition of the Pakistan Super League has been postponed indefinitely.

MUMBAI: A month after he created a flutter when he asked for a No Objection Certificate (NOC) to switch from Mumbai to Goa, India's opening batsman Yashasvi Jaiswal has taken a complete U-turn. Jaiswal now wants to play for Mumbai again. The 23-year-old has written an email to the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) to withdraw his NOC and said he is available to represent Mumbai for the next domestic season.“I the undersigned would request your goodself to consider my request in withdrawing my NOC given to me as I had some family plans in shifting to Goa which for now has been curtailed ! So I sincerely request MCA to allow me to play for Mumbai this season ! I have not submitted the NOC to the BCCI nor to the Goa Cricket Association,” Jaiswal wrote in email to MCA, a copy of which is with TOI.However, it could take some time before the Mumbai Cricket Association decided to have him back. ""We've to confirm with the BCCI and the Goa Cricket Association regarding his NOC,"" a source in the MCA told TOI.""He has written an email to us. We will now take up his email in our next Apex Council meeting, and take a decision accordingly. As it is, the terms of the present Cricket Improvement Committee and the Mumbai senior selection committee will come to end on May 31. A decision on Yashasvi will be at the discretion of the new CIC and selection committee. The Apex Council will take the primary decision,"" MCA secretary Abhay Hadap told TOI.In April, Jaiswal had left the MCA officials stumped when he sought an NOC to move to Goa, citing personal reasons for the need to shift base to Goa. If Jaiswal had gone ahead with his plan to represent Goa, he would have followed the likes of Arjun Tendulkar and Siddhesh Lad- Mumbai players who have played for Goa.Busy with his India commitments, Jaiswal could turn out in just one match for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy last season, scoring 4 & 26 in the five-wicket defeat to Jammu & Kashmir at the MCA ground in BKC in Mumbai in Jan this year. The left-hander has been in fine form while playing for the Rajasthan Royals in IPL-2025, where he has been the top run-getter for the franchise, scoring 473 runs in 12 matches@43.00, with a strike rate of 154.57, with five fifties under his belt.Jaiswal was one of the standout performers for India in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy , where he scored 391 runs in five Tests@43.44 , with one century and two half-centuries.",India's Yashasvi Jaiswal wants to play for Mumbai again.

Punjab were 122 for 1 in 10.1 overs when lights went out which at first was attributed to floodlight failure.Both teams were awarded a point each.Punjab, now on 16 points from 12 matches, stay in third place with a steady Net Run Rate (NRR) of +0.376. With two games still to play, they remain very much in control of their own destiny.

About the San Francisco Unicorns

The San Francisco Unicorns have finalised their squad for the upcoming 2025 Cognizant Major League Cricket (MLC) season with the signing of promising Australian wrist spinner Callum Stow.At just 22, Stow is emerging as one of Australia's most exciting spin prospects. He recently made his Big Bash League (BBL) debut for the Melbourne Renegades, stepping in for the iconic Nathan Lyon while he was on international duty.In two BBL appearances, Stow impressed by picking up three wickets at an economy rate of 7.75.The left-arm wrist spinner also made headlines during the 2024 Global Super League (GSL) in Guyana, where he bagged nine wickets in five matches for Cricket Victoria . There, he shared the field with several current Unicorns players, including Corey Anderson, Sanjay Krishnamurthi, and Karima Gore.Reflecting on his journey, Stow said, “The last few months have been a whirlwind, making the jump from Geelong to the Renegades, and now to Major League Cricket with the Unicorns. I can’t wait to get started in the USA. Playing with the likes of Corey [Anderson] and other Unicorns players in the GSL has given me an idea of the high standards and quality culture we’re looking to build in San Francisco. And with Shane’s coaching, this is a huge opportunity for me to show what I’m about and to continue my development as a T20 bowler.”Unicorns head coach Shane Watson praised the signing, adding: “We’ve been keeping an eye on Callum’s development for a while now. Having broken into the BBL earlier this year, it’s clear he’s ready for the next step in T20 cricket. His skillset and confidence will be a big asset, and the surprise factor of an unfamiliar spinner can be a real game-changer across the different pitches we’ll play on this season.”Quiz: Who's that IPL player? The San Francisco Unicorns begin their MLC 2025 campaign on June 12 at the Oakland Coliseum against the Washington Freedom, followed by home clashes with the LA Knight Riders and MI New York. They’ll then travel to Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium in Texas for four matches, before concluding the league stage with three games at Broward County Stadium in Florida – including a highly anticipated West Coast derby rematch with the Knight Riders. The playoffs will return to Grand Prairie.Formed in 2023 as one of six founding franchises of Major League Cricket, the San Francisco Unicorns have quickly become a flagship team in American cricket. Their home base is the historic Oakland Coliseum, and the team features international stars such as Matthew Short, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Finn Allen, and Liam Plunkett. The Unicorns’ high-performance partner is Cricket Victoria, the governing body for the sport in the Australian state of Victoria.The franchise is backed by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Anand Rajaraman and Venky Harinarayan, founders of Rocketship.vc and former creators of Junglee, acquired by Amazon in 1998 for $250 million.",The San Francisco Unicorns have signed Australian bowler Callum Stow.

Former India cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu has criticized Lucknow Super Giants captain Rishabh Pant 's performance in IPL 2025, highlighting concerns about his shot selection and suggesting a return to basics. Pant, who was acquired for Rs 27 crore in the auction, has struggled with just 128 runs in ten innings, including five single-digit scores and one duck.Pant's recent performance against Punjab Kings saw him score only 18 runs off 17 balls while chasing 237, as LSG lost by 37 runs.The team currently sits seventh on the points table with 10 points from 11 matches.""The problem with Rishabh Pant is his shot selection. You can't hit your way out of trouble every time. Maybe it's the pressure of his own reputation that's weighing him down and not allowing him to relax. It shows - his frustration is visible. As captain, he often loses his cool, that gives the opposition an edge. Look at Dhoni - calm, composed, giving nothing away. Pant needs to tune his mindset, especially around shot selection. He needs to go back to the basics,"" Sidhu said on JioHotstar.Regarding LSG's playoff chances, Sidhu noted that their prospects remain uncertain even if they win all remaining matches due to their poor net run rate, which is currently the lowest in the tournament.Sidhu also praised young opener Priyansh Arya 's performance against Delhi Capitals in Dharamshala, where he scored 70 runs off 34 balls with six sixes and five fours.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? ""Nobody would have expected this type of innings. This is incredible. I've never seen anyone at this age dominate bowling like Priyansh does, except for maybe Sachin Tendulkar . He has magical wrists. When he goes on the back foot and hits a six - stepping out and hitting is easier, but standing in position and hitting a six off the back foot is special. Whether it's a yorker or a short ball, he's hitting them for sixes. That's amazing. His range and all-round ability come from those wrists.

NEW DELHI: With only two days remaining for the official commencement of the SAFF U-19 football championship in Arunachal Pradesh , concerns have arisen about the seamless organisation of the six-nation tournament due to the absence of a ‘ Protected Area Permit ’ (PAP) or ‘Restricted Area Permit’ (RAP) document. This mandatory official paper is required for entry into the north-eastern state by visiting foreigners, including the participating teams.Hosts India are drawn alongside Nepal and Sri Lanka in Group B of the event, while Maldives, Bhutan and Bangladesh form Group A.The championship – the third edition of the regional U-19 men’s tournament – is scheduled to be played at the Golden Jubilee stadium in Arunachal’s Yupia from May 9 to 18. However, it’s been learnt that the organisers of the event are still awaiting the PAP/RAP clearance, so that the visiting teams can enter the state.While sources in the central govt say some state authorities who have been delegated the powers to issue a PAP/RAP can provide the same at their end, the state officials have instead been putting the onus on the Centre – primarily the ministry of home affairs (MHA), ministry of external affairs (MEA) and ministry of youth affairs and sports (MYAS) – to issue the document for the smooth conduct of the tournament.Under the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, issued by MHA, all areas falling between the ‘Inner line’ and the International Border of the state have been declared as Protected Area, which include the whole of Arunachal. All foreigners visiting the state will have to first register themselves with the Foreigners Registration Officer (FRO) of the state within 24 hours of their arrival.After that, the foreigners – in this case the visiting teams – are required to obtain a PAP/RAP from a competent authority to enter or visit a ‘Protected/Restricted Area’ (for playing the SAFF tournament in Arunachal), without which they won’t be allowed to compete.","The SAFF U-19 football championship in Arunachal Pradesh is set to begin on May 9.

Oliver Rowland couldn’t translate his pole into victory in Monaco Round 7





There is no stopping Oliver Rowland , who had double gains at the recently held Monaco E-Prix double-header and is “really pleased” with his position in Round 7. The Nissan driver won Round 6 and had said, “Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne, but you’ve already got one eye on tomorrow.” He did keep the champagne celebrations under control after his win in Monaco and yielded results with his podium finish the next day.Oliver Rowland had won the pole position and was confidently leading in the first half of the race, but as if the pole curse continues to be in place ever since 2022, he couldn’t manage to cross the finish line first. It was Envision Racing’s Sébastien Buemi who ended his more than six-year-long wait for a win by lifting the winner’s trophy on Day 2 of the Monaco E-Prix. Only António Félix da Costa had managed to translate his pole into a victory at the Formula E Monaco race in 2021.Sharing his take on the Monaco race, Rowland said, “I think honestly when he [Buemi] took his Attack Mode, he knew I had more to do — I think he was trying to back me into the pack, so when I took it, I lost quite a lot. But, first and second here doesn’t get much better, so I’m really, really pleased. We just need to keep pushing. We’ve got Tokyo next week where I was really strong last year, so hopefully we can have a real big push for that double-header and then keep pushing in the right direction.”Many believed Rowland was in his own race as he took a three-second lead in the first half. However, he lunged at the chicane on Lap 21, and it was Buemi who surpassed him at the right time. The Nissan driver's move was later judged over-exuberant by the stewards, forcing him to cede the position to Jean-Éric Vergne in recompense, but the damage cost the DS Penske driver a crack at the race win, as Mahindra Racing's Nyck de Vries and Buemi made it by as Vergne bogged down in avoiding action.Rowland once again gave up the lead to Vergne as he took his final mandatory 50kW, four-wheel drive Attack Mode activation, to use that overlap of extra power and traction to push past Vergne and de Vries on Laps 23 and 24 respectively, for second place at the flag, some four seconds back from Buemi.Also Read: Monaco E-Prix Round 6 winner Oliver Rowland delays celebrations for Round 7: “Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne but…” Up next is the Tokyo double-header on May 17 and 18.

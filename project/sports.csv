Beware Pakistan! Abhishek Sharma hits massive sixes in the nets

WATCH:

NEW DELHI: A viral video of India opener Abhishek Sharma practicing under the watchful eyes of mentor Yuvraj Singh has caught the imagination of cricket fans worldwide. The footage, shared widely on social media following India's thrilling Super Four Asia Cup victory over Pakistan, shows Abhishek tonking bowlers for sixes while Yuvraj offers instructions and encouragement.In the session, Yuvraj can be heard quipping, ""Single bhi le lo Maharaj [take a single too],"" as Abhishek maintained his natural attacking flair. The video ends with the 2-time World Cup winner joking: ""Tu na sudhri, bas chakke maari jaayi, thale na kheli [you won't change, hitting only sixes].""Abhishek's father told TOI that Yuvraj has been instrumental in his son's development. ""Yuvi paaji played a big role in the upliftment of Abhishek's game. He is his guru and always shares his experience. Yuvraj's mantra to Abhishek has been: 'play according to the situation of the game',"" he said, emphasising the focus on team success over individual glory.The mentorship has clearly paid off. Abhishek tempered his aggression while honing his six-hitting instinct under Yuvraj's guidance. ""Back your hitting zones, don't manufacture shots,"" has been Yuvraj's guiding advice.The results were evident in India's six-wicket win over Pakistan, where Abhishek smashed a 39-ball 74 and shared a 105-run opening partnership with Shubman Gill. He also broke the record for the fewest balls to reach 50 T20I sixes among full-member teams, achieving the milestone in just 331 deliveries, surpassing West Indies' Evin Lewis (366). Among Indians, only skipper Suryakumar Yadav follows with 510 balls.Abhishek said his aggressive approach was a response to Pakistan's on-field belligerence. ""Today it was very simple, the way they were coming at us for no reason, I didn't like it at all. This was the only way I could give medicine to them,"" he explained during the post-match presentation.With his record-breaking performance and mentorship from Yuvraj, Abhishek Sharma is rapidly cementing his place as a top T20I batter while continuing to delight fans with his destructive, yet calculated, batting style.","A viral video of India opener Abhishek Sharma practicing under the watchful eyes of mentor Yuvraj Singh has caught the imagination of cricket fans worldwide.

'Conditions didn’t let us score 200': Salman Ali Agha defends Pakistan after Asia Cup losses

Poll Was the third umpire's decision to dismiss Fakhar Zaman justified? Yes, he was out. No, he was not out. The decision was too close to call.

NEW DELHI: The dismissal of Pakistan opener Fakhar Zaman in the Asia Cup 2025 Super Four clash against India has ignited a storm of criticism, with former greats Shahid Afridi, Mohammad Yusuf, and Shoaib Akhtar all blasting the third umpire’s decision.Fakhar, who looked in ominous touch with three boundaries off nine balls, was given out caught behind off Hardik Pandya in the third over. Wicketkeeper Sanju Samson dived low to claim the chance, but replays suggested the ball was very close to the turf. Despite inconclusive evidence, the third umpire ruled Fakhar out, leaving the batter furious.On Samaa TV, Afridi did not mince words. With a mischievous grin, he quipped: “Unhone IPL me bhi toh umpiring karni hai [He has to umpire in the IPL too],” suggesting bias towards India. His comment drew laughter in the studio but underlined Pakistan’s simmering frustration.Yusuf backed him, stressing that Fakhar’s wicket came just as he was dominating India’s attack. “They didn’t even check many angles. Fakhar had hit three fours and handled Bumrah with ease in the first over. His wicket was crucial for India,” Yusuf lamented.Shoaib Akhtar, speaking on Tapmad, was equally blunt, branding the call a “wrong decision.”“Fakhar wasn’t out. With 26 cameras available, why did the third umpire only check two angles? If Fakhar had stayed, the match might have turned,” the Rawalpindi Express argued, adding that umpiring standards had clearly dropped.Pakistan captain Salman Agha admitted the call was debatable but refused to use it as an excuse. “Umpires can make mistakes. To me, it looked like the ball bounced, but India bowled well and we were inconsistent,” he said.India went on to chase down 172 in 18.5 overs, with Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill powering a 105-run opening stand. Once again, India’s players skipped handshakes with Pakistan, choosing instead to acknowledge only the match officials.Pakistan now head to Abu Dhabi to face Sri Lanka on Tuesday, while India meet Bangladesh on Wednesday in their next Super Four fixture.","Shahid Afridi, Mohammad Yusuf, and Shoaib Akhtar all blasted the third umpire's decision.

Beware Pakistan! Abhishek Sharma hits massive sixes in the nets

Poll Which aspect of the India-Pakistan match do you find more intriguing? The cricketing skills displayed. The rivalry and tension. The social media reactions.

NEW DELHI: After shutting down arch-rivals Pakistan for the second time in eight days, India opener Abhishek Sharma made a bold statement off the field, posting a sly dig at their rivals on social media. Leading from the front, Sharma smashed a scintillating 74 off just 39 balls as India chased down 172 in 18.5 overs to secure a six-wicket Super Four victory at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.Accompanying his post were action shots from the match, highlighting his 105-run opening partnership with close friend and fellow opener Shubman Gill , who contributed 47 off 28 balls. The post simply read: “You talk, we win.”The message quickly went viral, reflecting not just the on-field dominance but the simmering tension that characterised the clash.The match itself was charged from the outset. Tempers flared when Gill and Pakistan pacer Shaheen Afridi exchanged intense glances after boundaries were dispatched over the field. Abhishek and Haris Rauf also engaged in fiery on-field exchanges, with umpires stepping in to cool down moments of friction.“Today was pretty simple. The way they were coming out to us without any reason, I did not like it at all,” Abhishek said after being named player of the match. “That’s why I went after them. I wanted to deliver for the team.”Despite India losing Gill to Faheem Ashraf and Abhishek himself to Abrar Ahmed after his whirlwind innings, Tilak Varma’s unbeaten 30 guided the team home. India’s fielding, however, was not flawless, with four catches dropped, allowing Pakistan to post 171/5, with Sahibzada Farhan scoring a 58.The win marks a significant psychological advantage for India, who have now defeated Pakistan twice in the ongoing Asia Cup . With political tensions still simmering, these encounters continue to draw attention far beyond cricket, as social media reactions—including Abhishek’s pointed post—underscore the intensity of the rivalry.",India beat Pakistan by six wickets in their Super Four match in Dubai.

Beware Pakistan! Abhishek Sharma hits massive sixes in the nets

Fire, fury, and fireworks

Pakistan cash in on India’s sloppy fielding

""The best mirror is an old friend,” is a classical line by famous English poet George Herbert.Those lines seemed to have been written for Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma when the duo were batting together against Pakistan in their Super 4s clash at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.Gill and Abhishek were matching each other shot-for-shot and put on 105-runs for the opening wicket.On the eve of yet another highly-anticipated India vs Pakistan clash, only three Indian cricketers turned up for the optional practice session. Shubman Gill and Abhishek were two of them. Gill was struggling for runs, and it was Abhishek who lent him the comforting arm . He bowled in tandem with the net bowlers for an hour to Shubman. He challenged him to play sweep shots, teased his inability to hit the reverse sweep, and requested Varun Chakravarthy to trouble Gill with his variations. A day later, the duo, who have batted together since their U-12 days in Punjab , were at their destructive best.Chasing a stiff target of 172, India’s chase got off to a fiery start as Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill smashed a 100-run stand in just 8.4 overs. If Abhishek was at his destructive best, it was Gill who showed why he is such a delight to the eyes. In an expected high-voltage clash, which became even more dramatic due to the events of the past weeks , the Pakistani seamers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf started to abuse them in Punjabi. Shaheen had a go at Abhishek after being smacked for a six off the first ball.Shaheen then hurled a few abuses at Shubman, who looked at Shaheen and pointed with his hand where the ball went. There was a shade of Aamer Sohail vs Venky Prasad from 1996 to it. Haris Rauf hurled abuses at Abhishek, who hammered him for two boundaries, and the umpires had to intervene to separate Rauf and Abhishek.Abhishek set the tone by pulling Shaheen Afridi for a six off the very first over, while Gill, who had worked tirelessly in the nets on the eve of the match, struck boundaries with authority off Saim Ayub's off-spin. Their aggression only grew, with Abhishek dispatching Abrar Ahmed for towering sixes and Gill unfurling a reverse sweep — a stroke his partner had teased him about less than 24 hours ago.Abhishek raced to a 25-ball fifty, surviving two dropped chances along the way, while Gill kept the tempo high with crisp drives and sweeps. The partnership was finally broken at 105 when Gill, after battling cramps, was bowled by Faheem Ashraf for a brisk 47 off 28.India’s openers had set the chase alight with their fearless strokeplay and fiery exchanges, leaving Pakistan searching for answers. Abhishek departed for a sizzling 39-ball 74.India did lose quick wickets - Gill and then Suryakumar Yadav in the space of four balls - but it was too late for Pakistan. India chased down the total in 18.5 overs with six wickets in hand.India’s fielding woes came to the fore as they spilled five chances, allowing Pakistan to post a competitive 171/5.Sahibzada Farhan, the biggest beneficiary, rode his luck to a breezy half-century after being dropped twice by Abhishek Sharma.Abhishek first misjudged a regulation chance at third man when Farhan was on zero. The opener made India pay with crisp strokeplay, taking on Jasprit Bumrah for two boundaries and carting Varun Chakravarthy for back-to-back fours. He even finished the powerplay with two more boundaries off Bumrah as Pakistan raced to 55/1 after six overs.Farhan’s second life came in Varun’s over when Abhishek, stationed at long-on, covered ground to his right and leapt full stretch but failed to hold on, palming the ball over the ropes for six. The right-hander didn’t look back, slamming Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel for towering sixes to bring up his fifty, and his celebration took you back to MS Dhoni's first hundred against Pakistan.At 91/1 in 10 overs, Pakistan looked in control before Shivam Dube’s golden arm turned things around. He broke the 72-run stand by deceiving Saim Ayub with a slower one; this time Abhishek made amends with a diving catch running in from deep square. Dube then accounted for Farhan with another slower ball, Surya Yadav holding his nerve despite the batter’s bat flying out of his hands mid-shot.Kuldeep tightened the screws as Pakistan endured 21 balls without a boundary. Hussain Talat fell cheaply before skipper Salman Ali Agha ended the boundary drought, which lasted for 37 balls, with a six off the first ball of the 17th over. Dube’s fine spell, however, was blemished when Nawaz plundered 17 runs. Nawaz was then found napping as he didn’t plant his bat in the crease and Surya’s direct hit connected on the bounce.Fielding lapses continued to haunt India. Shubman Gill spilled a sitter at deep mid-wicket, giving Faheem Ashraf a reprieve. Bumrah endured a rare off day, finishing wicketless for 45 runs in his four overs. Pakistan eventually closed at 171/5, aided by India’s butterfingers as Faheem’s late six came off yet another dropped chance, this time the culprit was Shivam Dube, who misjudged a catch at the third-man region.For India, despite the five missed opportunities, their bowlers kept Pakistan in check, but the lack of discipline in the field left the contest delicately poised heading into the chase.",Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill put on 100-run stand in 8.4 overs. Pakistan seamers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf started to abuse them in Punjabi. India chased down the total in 18.5 overs with six wickets in hand.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124032739,imgsize-80986,width-400,resizemode-4/abhishek-gill-2109-afp.jpg"

Poll Which player impressed you the most in the recent India-Pakistan match? Abhishek Sharma Shubman Gill

The India–Pakistan Asia Cup clash in Dubai was already tense, with on-field confrontations and the continuing no-handshake row, but what happened on Pakistani television during the match has left fans stunned.A clip from a talk show has gone viral where the presenter openly asked a shocking question:To this, a panelist replied with a laugh,The casual suggestion of using violence to stop the game has been slammed online as disgraceful and shameful.Click here to watch the video The show also had former Pakistan cricketers Basit Ali and Kamran Akmal as experts, and the clip has brought further embarrassment to Pakistan cricket at a time when the team itself is struggling on the field.Speaking of firing bullets, Pakistan's Sahibzada Farhan held his bat up like a gun and took aim at the crowd before gesturing to fire a few shots. This too, was heavily criticized after the game, although the batter suggested that it was not premeditated and that he didn't care what people felt about it.On the ground, Abhishek Sharma delivered a masterclass with a brutal yet elegant 74 off 39 balls, setting the tone alongside childhood friend Shubman Gill in a 105-run opening stand. India chased down 172 with ease, winning by six wickets with seven balls to spare. The match itself had its share of heated moments, with Shaheen Afridi and Haris Rauf trying to provoke Indian batters, only for Gautam Gambhir and the umpires to step in and cool things down.But instead of talking cricket, Pakistan is once again in the news for all the wrong reasons.

Poll What do you think about Pakistan's batting approach in the recent match against India? Too timid Aggressive enough Just right Needs improvement

Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif launched a scathing attack at Salman Ali Agha's team's ""timid"" approach as they suffered another defeat against an unstoppable-looking India.""This match wasn’t enjoyable,"" Latif told TimesofIndia.com after Pakistan's six-wicket loss in the Super 4s against India on Sunday at the Dubai International Stadium.""Pakistan were batting so well, how did it suddenly turn bad? You didn’t even try to be aggressive. They gave up. Why didn’t they try to attack in the middle overs, I don’t know,"" said Latif, while pointing out the middle-over phase, where Pakistan failed to hit a single boundary for 37 balls.Pakistan were in the driving seat until Saim Ayub got out. Hussain Talat, who was promoted at No. 4, forged a run-a-ball 17-run stand with Sahibzada Farhan, which Rashid felt derailed Pakistan's momentum.""Sahibzada Farhan and Hussain Talat had a 17-run partnership in 17 balls. Farhan scored 5 off 6 deliveries, and Talat made 10 off 11. At that point, Pakistan was in control.""You should have gone for your shots, even if you got out. Instead, you got out after wasting time,"" said Rashid.Latif, who played 37 Tests and 166 ODIs for Pakistan, also lamented all-rounder Mohammad Nawaz, who looked all at sea during his 19-ball 21 knock.""Then Mohammad Nawaz came, and he too played slowly, never tried to accelerate the scoring rate. That’s why I don’t trust their batting or bowling,"" he said.The way this Asia Cup has gone so far, it is a battle to see who takes on India in the final. Such has been India's dominance that they are almost guaranteed a spot in the summit clash.""We are yet to play a perfect game, but we are getting there. A great game, but in the powerplay they took the game away from us,"" Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha said in the post-match presentation.""Looking back, with the position we were in after 10 overs, we could have got 10-15 more. 170-180 is a good total, but in the powerplay they batted well, that was the difference.""If you see the bowlers are going for runs, you need to change it, that's how it goes in T20s.

Exchanging notes? Gautam Gambhir in a long chat with UAE coach Lalchand Rajput

India’s six-wicket win over Pakistan in the Asia Cup Super Four clash in Dubai may have been convincing on the scoreboard, but the bigger talking point came after the final ball was bowled. Head coach Gautam Gambhir , standing near the boundary line, was caught on camera telling his players,– a remark that perfectly summed up the unusual post-match scenes.Click here to watch the video For the second time in a week, Indian players refused to engage in the customary handshake with their Pakistani opponents. Instead, after Tilak Varma struck the winning boundary to finish the chase at 174-4, the batters walked back to the dugout without acknowledging the opposition.A little later, some Indian players came back out but only to shake hands with the umpires and match referee Andy Pycroft. Gambhir’s nudge to “at least greet the officials” made it clear that while India’s stance against Pakistan would hold firm, there was still respect for those overseeing the contest.This mirrored what had happened at the toss earlier in the evening. Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav once again avoided shaking hands with Pakistan skipper Salman Agha, going straight to commentator Ravi Shastri and the match referee instead. He even shared an embrace with the India legend.The gesture – or lack of it – has now become one of the defining stories of this Asia Cup.On the field, India were dominant. Abhishek Sharma ’s blistering 74 off 39 balls set the tone before Shubman Gill and Tilak Varma ensured a smooth finish. Yet once again, the cricketing brilliance was overshadowed by off-field tensions.Besides the lack of handshakes, there was more tension between players, with heated exchanges, controversial gestures and more dominating India's successful chase. Haris Rauf, Abhishek Sharma and Sahibzada Farhan all made headlines with their gestures, be it celebratory or provocative.The handshake row shows no signs of ending, and Gambhir’s words have now added another chapter to the drama.","India beat Pakistan by six wickets in the Asia Cup Super Four clash in Dubai.

For Pakistan

If Pakistan defeat Sri Lanka

Poll Who do you think will reach the finals of the Asia Cup 2025? India Bangladesh Pakistan Sri Lanka

NEW DELHI: India and Bangladesh have made winning starts to their Super 4s campaigns in the ongoing Asia Cup 2025 in the UAE, but the race to the final is still wide open. Defending champions India extended their dominance over arch-rivals Pakistan with a six-wicket victory on Sunday, a week after beating them in the group stage. Bangladesh, meanwhile, handed Sri Lanka a four-wicket defeat on Saturday.The results leave India and Bangladesh leading the Super Four standings with two points each. India hold the edge with a superior net run rate of +0.689, while Bangladesh sit at +0.121. Pakistan and Sri Lanka are yet to open their accounts, but with four games left in this stage, both remain in contention for a spot in the summit clash., the path is straightforward but steep: they, first against Sri Lanka on Tuesday and then against Bangladesh on Thursday. Two victories would give Salman Agha’s men four points, potentially setting up a blockbuster third showdown with India in the final next Sunday.on Tuesday, it will knock the islanders out of contention after two straight losses.Table-toppers India and Bangladesh are set to clash on Wednesday, and given India’s dominant form, they are widely expected to book a spot in the final unbeaten. That would leave Pakistan needing to overcome Bangladesh in their last Super 4s fixture on Thursday — effectively turning it into a virtual semi-final.In such a scenario, the final Super Four match between India and Sri Lanka on Friday would carry little significance in terms of qualification for the title clash.Should this scenario unfold, fans would witness three consecutive weekends of India-Pakistan clashes — an unprecedented streak in a long while.India’s latest win over Pakistan was set up by opener Abhishek Sharma , who blazed 74 off 39 balls, and Shubman Gill , who contributed 47 in a century stand. Despite a brief wobble in the middle order, Tilak Varma and Hardik Pandya saw the team home with ease. Earlier, Shivam Dube’s double strike curtailed Pakistan’s promising start, exposing the frailties in their batting depth.Pakistan, however, showed flashes of fight.

How Shubman Gill is getting ready for Pakistan challenge in Asia Cup

NEW DELHI: India’s vice-captain Shubman Gill set social media buzzing on Sunday night with a four-word message that perfectly summed up the mood after India’s fiery Asia Cup Super Four win over Pakistan in Dubai.Shortly after India clinched a six-wicket victory — their second over Pakistan in the ongoing tournament — Gill shared action shots from the match on social media platforms with the caption: “Game speaks, not words.”The post, cryptic yet loaded with meaning, quickly went viral, drawing massive engagement from fans who saw it as a sharp response to the heated on-field exchanges during the high-voltage clash.The game itself was as charged as Gill suggested. India chased down Pakistan’s 172-run target with seven balls to spare, riding on a blistering 74 from opener Abhishek Sharma and a fluent 47 from Gill. The duo added 105 runs in just nine overs, silencing Pakistan’s much-vaunted pace attack.But beyond the runs, it was the simmering tension between the players that stole headlines. From the very first over, Abhishek went after Shaheen Afridi with a top-edged six and followed it up with verbal volleys.Gill, too, locked eyes with Shaheen after a crisp extra-cover boundary, while later in the innings, Abhishek and Haris Rauf clashed mid-pitch, forcing the umpire to intervene.The needle continued even after the final ball. For the second time in this Asia Cup, Indian players walked off without shaking hands with their Pakistani counterparts, a move that further highlighted the hostility between the two sides.Gill’s message, then, struck a chord. In just four words, he appeared to brush aside all the chatter, gesturing that India’s performance on the field was answer enough to Pakistan’s aggression.While the tense atmosphere dominated, Abhishek Sharma's celebration was one that was rooted in ""love"". After the win, the batter explained that his 'L' gesture meant ""love"" and was aimed at all the Indian supporters.","India beat Pakistan by six wickets in the Asia Cup Super Four match in Dubai.

NEW DELHI: Shahid Afridi has slammed the Pakistan cricket management’s decision to appoint Salman Agha as the captain of the T20I team. Under Agha’s leadership, Pakistan has struggled and faced intense criticism from former players and cricket pundits.Agha was handed the T20I captaincy during the late 2024 tour of Zimbabwe and is now leading the side in the 2025 Asia Cup, where his captaincy has come under heavy scrutiny.Under his command, Pakistan has lost both of their matches against India in the tournament. They went down by seven wickets in the group stage and were defeated again in the Super Four clash by six wickets, leaving fans and experts frustrated.""Koi baat nahi, time lo, soch ke decision lo, aur phir us bande ko sahi jagah pe bitha do, decision sahi ho jayenge. Ab Salman Ali Agha mujhe, ab aap soch lo, Salman Ali Agha mujhe bahut pasand hai. ODIs ke andar, haan, agar aap kahoge captain to main Salman Ali Agha ka naam lunga [It’s okay, take your time, make a decision after thinking, and then put the right person in the right place — the decisions will turn out fine. Now, as for Salman Ali Agha, you know, I really like him. In ODIs, yes, if you ask me for a captain, I would take Salman Ali Agha’s name],"" Afridi said.""Ab T20 ke andar, ek captain bana diya jiska strike rate sirf 79 hai. Toh 79 ke strike rate ko aap kaise captain bana rahe ho? Ye dusron ke liye kya example set karega ki kitna fast khelna hai? [Now, in T20s, you’ve made a captain whose strike rate is only 79. How can you make someone with a 79 strike rate a captain? What kind of example does that set for others on how fast they should play?]""""Toh kehne ka matlab ye hai ki time lo, jo bhi captain banana hai, time lo. Koi jaldi mat karo, aur jaldi bhi nahi hai. Aage, Rizwan ko continue kar lete hain, koi problem nahi hai, aur phir decide karenge. Ek team mate hai woh. [So the point is — take time when choosing a captain. Don’t rush, there’s no hurry.

Sourav Ganguly is back at the helm of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB). The former India captain was elected unopposed as president at the association’s 94th annual general meeting on Monday, ending a six-year gap since his last stint from 2015 to 2019.The 53-year-old replaced his elder brother Snehasish Ganguly, who stepped down after completing the maximum six-year tenure. Ganguly, who also served as BCCI president between 2019 and 2022, now returns to state cricket administration with some ambitious plans.One of his main priorities is to restore Eden Gardens’ capacity to one lakh. The venue currently holds around 68,000 spectators, a reduction made before the 2011 World Cup. Ganguly said the expansion project would only move forward after next year’s T20 World Cup. “Whatever happens it would be after the T20 World Cup next year. It will take time. The lease has been renewed,” he said, as quoted by PTI.Eden Gardens is also set to play a major role in India’s cricket calendar. The stadium will host the opening Test of the home series against South Africa on November 14, which will be the first Test at the venue since the 2019 day-night pink-ball match against Bangladesh.“This will be a good Test match, South Africa being the world champions… India and South Africa both are good sides, I’m sure it will be a good Test,” Ganguly said.The ground is also expected to stage high-profile matches during the 2026 T20 World Cup, possibly including a semifinal. Ganguly confirmed he would soon hold discussions with the new BCCI office bearers.Beyond such high-profile fixtures, Ganguly stressed his focus on Bengal cricket’s long-term development. He highlighted a new state-of-the-art academy planned in Dumurjala, Howrah, spread over nine acres with floodlights and modern facilities. “It would be like Kalyani Academy but there would be floodlights and other state-of-the-art facilities… the plan has been sanctioned, it will take at least one, one and a half years,” he said.The CAB also raised its development fund for districts from ₹5 crore to ₹8 crore. Alongside Ganguly, the entire panel, featuring Bablu Kolay (secretary), Madan Mohan Ghosh (joint secretary), Sanjay Das (treasurer) and Anu Dutta (vice-president) were elected unopposed.","Sourav Ganguly is back at the helm of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) The former India captain was elected unopposed as president at the association’s 94th annual general meeting on Monday.

India’s victory over Pakistan in the Asia Cup Super 4 clash in Dubai was shaped by the brilliance of openers Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill. The pair added 105 runs inside nine overs, setting up a six-wicket win as they crunched Pakistan’s pace attack.Abhishek smashed 74 off 39 balls, striking six fours and five sixes. Gill supported him with 47 from 28 deliveries, showing control and composure. Their fearless approach even earned praise from Pakistan greats Misbah-ul-Haq and Shoaib Malik.“The skill level is exceptional, and the temperament is impressive,” Misbah said on Tapmad’s post-match show, pointing out how Abhishek attacked Pakistan’s frontline bowlers without hesitation. Malik highlighted Gill’s adaptability: “Everything about him is high quality… he knows how to play all around the field.”India captain Suryakumar Yadav summed up their partnership by calling them “ice and fire,” a nod to how well their contrasting styles worked together.

NEW DELHI: Provocative gestures from Pakistan’s Haris Rauf and Sahibzada Farhan during their Super Four clash against India in Dubai on Sunday, have sparked controversy and drawn a strong response from former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan While Sahibzada Farhan celebrated his half-century with a gun gesture, Haris Rauf mimicked fighter jets crashing while fielding near the boundary. Both gestures appeared directed at Indian fans, and they did not sit well with Pathan, who termed them “immature” and “expected.”India, meanwhile, continued their dominance in Asia Cup 2025, defeating Pakistan by six wickets — their second victory over their arch-rivals in the tournament after also winning the group-stage encounter. The opening partnership of Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill once again demolished Pakistan’s bowling, ensuring India’s chase of 172 was completed with ease and seven balls to spare.Speaking on his YouTube channel on Monday evening, Pathan expressed disappointment at the antics of Rauf and Farhan, while also praising India’s professionalism and discipline.“Yesterday’s India-Pakistan match — India played some brilliant cricket.It was a commanding victory. There’s no need to even say it anymore — India just keeps winning, India keeps moving forward, that’s India’s greatness,” Pathan said.He pointed out that the banter on the field crossed a line, even referencing Abhishek’s post-match comments.“Yesterday, there was a lot of aggression, a lot of banter. Even Abhishek Sharma, during the post-match presentation, said that the Pakistani players were saying things they shouldn’t have. That’s why, when he and others like Shubman Gill posted on social media, the message was clear: ‘You keep talking, we’ll keep winning.’”Pathan emphasised that Indian cricket has traditionally preferred silence and focus over needless chatter but stressed that provocation would not be ignored anymore.“We Indians, even the former players, don’t get disturbed. We have always quietly played our cricket — in the past, today, and we will continue in the future. But don’t expect that if you start something, whether you are an Australian, Pakistani, or anyone else, that we will stay silent. We will respond — with our bat, and with our words,” he said.Pathan added that former cricketers from Pakistan often try to cash in on the India-Pakistan rivalry by dragging Indian players’ names into debates. “Some former players don’t like this. They make shows in the media using my name, they earn from it. I’m not taunting, I’m happy — if your livelihood runs because of my name, keep going.”The former India pacer dismissed suggestions that he should confront Pakistan players directly (slammed Shahid Afridi ).“And those who say ‘say it to our face’ — I’ve dismissed such players 10 times, 20 times, I’ll dismiss them again. If they can’t survive on the field, how will they survive off the field? Ashwin made a very good point on his YouTube channel about this, and he’s right. Aamna-saamna hoga zaroor aur woh banda tik nahi paayega [But whenever the chance comes, there will be face-to-face, and they won’t last]”On Farhan’s celebration, Pathan was particularly critical. “Everyone knows what’s going on between the two countries, and doing such celebrations on the field doesn’t say much. I used to think he was okay, but when you take things to a personal level, it’s too much. On the field, you play cricket. Win or lose, that’s part of the game. But when you cross the line, that’s wrong.”Pathan made it clear he wasn’t shocked. “Honestly, I wasn’t surprised. This is the kind of behavior they are capable of. Fans only see what the TV shows, but what doesn’t get shown — people don’t even know. If they don’t do such things, we don’t react either. We just want to play cricket, to win. Our skill level is way ahead of others, especially our neighbors. When you’re that skilled, you don’t even need banter — they need it. ”He concluded with a sharp remark on the larger picture. “I believe that the day Indian cricket takes a break, their cricket and their media can’t even breathe. They don’t get views, their livelihood stops. But for Indian cricket, it doesn’t matter. If you misbehave, and expect us to stay silent — this is the new India, we don’t let it go.”",Pakistan's Haris Rauf and Sahibzada Farhan made provocative gestures during their Super Four clash against India on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: After India defeated Pakistan by six wickets in their Super Four Asia Cup clash on Sunday, Indian T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav was in a jubilant mood. Sharing a lighter side of life after the big win, Surya posted a video featuring a dog, introducing it as “entertainment.” Starting the clip with “Ye kutta bolta hai” (This dog speaks), he even tried a playful conversation with the dog. The video has since gone viral on social media, offering fans a glimpse of the skipper’s lighter side.India’s win marked their second triumph over Pakistan in this tournament and their seventh successive white-ball victory against their arch-rivals since the ICC T20 World Cup 2022.In the Super Four clash, Pakistan’s 171/5 — highlighted by a 58-ball 58 from Sahibzada Farhan and aided by a few dropped catches from India — looked competitive initially.However, India’s opening pair of Abhishek Sharma (74 off 39 balls, with six fours and five sixes) and vice-captain Shubman Gill (47 off 28 balls, with eight fours) ran riot, both on the field and verbally, taking their team to a comfortable six-wicket win with seven balls to spare.India elected to field first. Pakistan lost Fakhar Zaman early, but a 72-run stand between Farhan and Saim Ayub (21 off 17 balls) steadied the innings.Late contributions from Mohammed Nawaz (21) and Faheem Ashraf (20*) lifted Pakistan to 171/5 in 20 overs. Shivam Dube was India’s pick of the bowlers with figures of 2/33, while Kuldeep Yadav and Hardik Pandya picked one wicket each.During the run chase, Abhishek and Gill dismantled the Pakistani attack in the first ten overs, leaving Haris Rauf (2/26) as the lone resistance. Tilak Varma (30*) and Hardik (7*) then guided India to victory.Abhishek Sharma’s stellar innings earned him the Player of the Match award.Reflecting on the result, Suryakumar Yadav said the India-Pakistan rivalry “is not a rivalry anymore.” He added, “Rivalry is when 15-20 matches are played by both sides and one side is ahead by 8-7. 3-0, 10-1… this is not a rivalry anymore.”",India defeated Pakistan by six wickets in their Super Four Asia Cup clash on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Abhishek Sharma smashed five sixes in a 39-ball 74 as India defeated Pakistan by six wickets in the Super Four stage of the Asia Cup on Sunday. The long-standing handshake protocol between the archrivals was once again ignored, with no handshakes before or after the match. While India is the designated host of the eight-nation Asia Cup, the T20 tournament is being played in the United Arab Emirates because India and Pakistan do not play on each other’s home soil.India captain Suryakumar Yadav has previously stated that the team is aligned with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and government instructions that players would not shake hands with Pakistan cricketers.Abhishek’s explosive half-century — which included a six off the very first ball — anchored India’s successful chase. Vice-captain Shubman Gill contributed 47 off 28 balls, while Tilak Varma and Sanju Samson finished the innings as India reached 174-4 in 18.5 overs.Earlier, Pakistan posted 171-5 in their 20 overs. Opener Sahibzada Farhan led the charge with 58 off 45, but the innings lost momentum in the middle overs. Faheem Ashraf’s 20 not out helped Pakistan reach a par total, yet it quickly became clear that the score was insufficient against India’s aggressive batting.This was the second meeting between the two sides in this Asia Cup, with India having already beaten Pakistan in Group A by seven wickets a week earlier.Following India’s win, a comment from Rohit Sharma during the 2019 World Cup went viral. After being named Player of the Match, a Pakistani journalist asked Rohit what advice he would give to Pakistan’s batters, who, in his words, were going through a ‘crisis.’Rohit replied in his trademark humorous style:""Agar main Pakistan ka coach bana to main bataunga, abhi kya bataunga! (If I become the coach of Pakistan then surely I will tell you. What can I say now!),"" he said.India will now take on Bangladesh in their next Super Four clash at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Wednesday.","India defeated Pakistan by six wickets in the Super Four stage of the Asia Cup.

Poll Who was the standout performer in India's victory over Pakistan? Abhishek Sharma Shubman Gill Tilak Varma Hardik Pandya

India extended their unbeaten run at the 2025 Men’s T20 Asia Cup with a commanding six-wicket victory over Pakistan in Dubai on Sunday, chasing down 172 with seven balls to spare. The win also marked India’s highest successful chase against their arch-rivals in T20Is.Abhishek Sharma was the main man in India’s chase, blasting 74 from 39 deliveries in a fiery knock that crushed Pakistan’s attack from the start. He hooked the first ball of the innings from Shaheen Shah Afridi for six, setting the tone for an opening partnership of 105 with Shubman Gill, who struck 47 off 28. By the time the stand was broken, India were very much in control.Coming in after the wicket of Suryakumar Yadav in the 11th over, Tilak Varma’s composed unbeaten 30 off 19 balls sealed the contest. The left-hander finished the game in style, flicking a low full toss from Afridi to the boundary. He walked off alongside Hardik Pandya without handshakes with the opposition, celebrations instead confined to the Indian dugout.Varma’s late flourish earned him the “Impact Player of the Match” award in the Indian dressing room. Reflecting on his role, he said, “I was thinking to finish the game in the last two games as well, but couldn’t.Today, my turn has come. I’ll keep trying till the end of the tournament, and like gauti sir (Gautam Gambhir) said, till the World Cup, we’ll keep learning and keep moving forward.”The batter was handed the award by training assistant Raghavindraa D, a training specialist with the side. His words of motivation ahead of handing the award to Varma charged up the players after the game.India's next game in the competition is against Bangladesh on Wednesday, September 24.","India beat Pakistan by six wickets in the 2025 Men’s T20 Asia Cup.

NEW DELHI: Opener Abhishek Sharma smashed a brilliant 74 to power India to a six-wicket win over Pakistan, as the handshake saga continued in the Super Four clash of the Asia Cup on Sunday.Chasing 172, India got off to a flying start with a 105-run opening partnership between the left-handed Abhishek and Shubman Gill, who made 47, before sealing victory with seven balls to spare in Dubai.Tensions rose during the chase when Gill and Shaheen Afridi exchanged fiery glances after the Indian batter struck the pacer for a boundary.Abhishek and Gill went on the attack from the outset, hammering boundaries at will and racing to 101-0 in just nine overs to dismantle Pakistan’s bowling.After the win, former India cricketer Munaf Patel took to social media to celebrate India’s dominant performance.""Ek rehta he Maarna. Aur ek hota he Ragad Ragad k Dhona. Wo hua he #indvspak k match main. On filed keh k Mara he Gill & Abhishek ne. Post Match main #AbhishekSharma ne Interview main Bajayi he.

Bhai Bas Maza Aa gaya #indvspak2025 #AsiaCup2025,"" he wrote.Earlier, India had opted to field first, but Pakistan made a strong start through Sahibzada Farhan, who top-scored with 58, and Saim Ayub, who made 21. The pair added 72 runs for the second wicket to lift their side to 171-5.Fakhar Zaman had set the tone early with a quickfire 15 off nine balls before being caught behind. Farhan carried on the momentum with five fours and three sixes in his 45-ball knock, bringing up his half-century with a six and marking it with a gun-celebration using his bat.India struck back with three wickets, including Farhan, who was dismissed by medium-pacer Shivam Dube as Pakistan slipped to 115-4. Mohammad Nawaz made 21 before being run out, while skipper Salman Agha (17) and Faheem Ashraf (20 off eight balls) added 22 late runs to push the total.Dube returned the best figures for India with 2-33, though the fielding left much to be desired as four catches went down.This was India’s second win over Pakistan in the tournament, having already beaten them in the group stage.",Opener Abhishek Sharma smashed 74 to power India to a six-wicket win over Pakistan.

Poll Should Barcelona consider signing a new midfielder given the recent injuries? Yes, absolutely No, trust the current squad

Barcelona midfielder Gavi will undergo surgery on his right knee to repair a meniscus injury, the club confirmed on Monday.The 21-year-old has been sidelined for 4 weeks now and has featured in only two matches this season, both in August. After initial conservative treatment, Gavi was put through “intense sporting stress tests,” and the club said the results led medical staff to opt for surgery.“The conclusion is that in order to guarantee the best possible recovery and return to competitive action, this Tuesday Gavi will undergo an arthroscopic (procedure),” Barcelona said in a statement.The procedure, commonly known as keyhole surgery, will be performed this week, though the club has not yet specified a recovery timeline.Barcelona are currently second in La Liga, two points behind leaders Real Madrid after beating Getafe 3-0 at the weekend.In Europe, they opened their Champions League campaign with a 2-1 victory at Newcastle and will next host Paris Saint-Germain on October 1. In the league, their next fixture is away to Oviedo on Thursday.In a further blow, the club also confirmed midfielder Fermín López suffered a muscle injury in his left leg during the Getafe win.He is expected to be out for around three weeks.The double setback comes at a crucial stage of the season as Barcelona look to keep pace in the title race and continue their strong start in Europe.Hansi Flick's men have already been making do without star man Lamine Yamal, who was injured while on International duty with Spain.

The football world’s spotlight turns to Paris on Monday, 22 September 2025, as the 69th Ballon d’Or ceremony takes centre stage at the Théâtre du Châtelet. The night promises not only the crowning of the best male and female footballers of the 2024/25 season but also recognition across a wide array of categories celebrating talent, leadership, goalscoring brilliance, and humanitarian impact.First awarded in 1956 by France Football, the Ballon d’Or is the sport’s most prestigious individual prize. While Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo dominated the award for over a decade, recent years have opened the door for new icons, with Manchester City’s Rodri lifting the trophy in 2024.Since 2024, the award has been co-organised by UEFA and Groupe Amaury, with the voting process still conducted by journalists worldwide.This year features a record number of honours, including three new women’s categories – the Women’s Yashin Trophy, Women’s Gerd Müller Trophy, and Women’s Kopa Trophy.The men’s race is billed as a duel between Ousmane Dembélé and Lamine Yamal. Dembélé, reinvented as a lethal forward at PSG, scored 35 goals in a treble-winning season and is widely tipped as favourite. “It’s nice after a wonderful season with PSG… the Ballon d’Or is the individual Holy Grail,” he told Le Monde.On the other side is 18-year-old Lamine Yamal, Barcelona’s prodigy, who notched 18 goals and lifted both La Liga and Copa del Rey. “I don’t dream of winning one Ballon d’Or, I dream of winning lots,” Yamal declared recently.Other big names in contention include Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah, Harry Kane, Vinícius Júnior, Jude Bellingham and PSG’s star-studded squad featuring Hakimi, Donnarumma, and Vitinha.In the women’s category, Aitana Bonmatí (Barcelona/Spain) will try to secure her third straight Ballon d’Or, though competition is fierce. Teammate Alexia Putellas and England stars Lucy Bronze, Alessia Russo, and Leah Williamson could challenge strongly.For the Club of the Year, Barcelona, Liverpool, PSG, Chelsea, Botafogo (men) and Arsenal, Barcelona, Chelsea, OL Lyonnes, Orlando Pride (women) are nominated.For the coaching awards, Antonio Conte (Napoli) and Luis Enrique (PSG) headline the men’s Johan Cruyff Trophy list, while Sarina Wiegman (England) and Sonia Bompastor (Chelsea) lead the women’s nominees.An international jury of journalists casts votes:Each juror selects 10 players, with descending points (15–1).

Villa remain winless

Gabriel Martinelli struck deep into stoppage time to earn Arsenal a 1-1 draw against Manchester City on Sunday, keeping the Gunners within sight of the Premier League summit.City had led from the ninth minute after Erling Haaland finished off a swift counter-attack. The Norwegian forward began the move in his own half, linked up with Tijjani Reijnders, and raced clear to slot past David Raya. Haaland’s goal was his 13th of the season for club and country.Arsenal found it difficult to respond in a subdued first half, their best chance falling to Noni Madueke, whose strike was pushed away by Gianluigi Donnarumma. The Italian goalkeeper has settled quickly since joining City and produced another key save to deny Eberechi Eze in the second half.Mikel Arteta introduced Bukayo Saka and Eze after the break in search of creativity, but City sat deeper as Pep Guardiola withdrew Haaland and Phil Foden to reinforce his defence. That approach looked set to secure three points until Martinelli, on as a substitute, latched onto Eze’s lofted pass and lifted the ball over Donnarumma in the 93rd minute.The result leaves Arsenal second in the table, five points behind leaders Liverpool, while City sit ninth.Aston Villa’s poor start under Unai Emery showed no signs of easing as they were held 1-1 at 10-man Sunderland.The hosts lost Reinildo Mandava to a red card in the 33rd minute for an off-the-ball kick at Matty Cash. Villa, without a goal in their previous four league outings, finally ended that drought when Cash’s long-range strike beat goalkeeper Robin Roefs in the 41st minute.But the advantage was short-lived. Wilson Isidor levelled eight minutes later, capitalising on Granit Xhaka’s header for his third goal in as many league matches at the Stadium of Light.Emery admitted his side failed to impose themselves despite the numerical advantage. “It should have been easier to take advantage (against 10 men) but we were not playing with our identity, with the ideas we have been building in the last three years,” he said, as quoted by AFP.The draw leaves Villa in the bottom three with three points from five games, while Sunderland move into seventh.",Gabriel Martinelli scores in stoppage time to earn Arsenal a 1-1 draw against Manchester City.

Poll Is Messi the best player in MLS history? Yes No Not sure

Superstar Lionel Messi once again showcased why he is indispensable for Inter Miami, scoring two brilliant goals and creating another as his side defeated DC United 3-2 on Saturday at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The victory keeps Miami firmly in the hunt for an MLS Cup playoff spot.Messi, 38, now has 22 goals in 22 matches this season, moving to the top of the MLS scoring chart after surpassing Sam Surridge of Nashville. This marked Messi’s seventh double of the campaign, highlighting his consistent brilliance.“It was another ordinary night for him, which is totally extraordinary for any other football player,” Miami coach Javier Mascherano said. “His ability not only to score but to make the team play, to find situations, and to carry the team on his shoulders when we needed him most — that is the advantage of having him.”Miami opened the scoring in the 35th minute when Messi threaded a precise through ball to Tadeo Allende, who slotted past DC United goalkeeper Luis Barraza. Christian Benteke equalised in the 52nd minute, but Messi soon restored Miami’s lead with a composed finish from Jordi Alba’s pass in the 66th minute.Messi added a third in the 85th, dribbling past defenders before curling a left-footed strike beyond Barraza. The goal proved crucial as Jacob Murrell scored in stoppage time to make it 3-2.Mascherano also praised Messi’s off-the-ball generosity. When 19-year-old Mateo Silvetti missed a penalty, Messi’s earlier assist had been a gesture to involve a teammate seeking his first goal, reflecting the Argentine’s leadership and team spirit.With the win, Miami climbed to fifth in the Eastern Conference with 52 points. Messi’s heroics not only kept Miami’s playoff hopes alive but also reinforced why the club is eager to extend his stay in Major League Soccer beyond next year.","Lionel Messi scored twice as Inter Miami defeated DC United 3-2.

The win maintained Madrid's perfect start to the season with five wins in five rounds, moving them five points clear of both Espanyol and Barcelona.Militão opened the scoring in the 22nd minute with a powerful right-foot shot from outside the area that found the top corner, with goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic barely getting a touch despite a diving effort.Mbappé doubled Madrid's lead in the 47th minute with another impressive strike from distance that nestled into the bottom corner, marking his seventh goal in six games this season.""When you are facing a defense set well inside its area, you have to try from long range,"" coach Xabi Alonso said. ""Militão's goal was very good, and Kylian scored in transition.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

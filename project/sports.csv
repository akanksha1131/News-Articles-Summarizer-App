Washington Sundar on Virat Kohli-Yashasvi Jaiswal run-out

MELBOURNE: In just 28 deliveries, India lost the advantage they had built for most of the afternoon at the Melbourne Cricket Ground ( MCG ). From a solid 153/2, the visitors collapsed to 159/5 in what was a mad period of 30 minutes on Day 2 of the ongoing Boxing Day Test between India and Australia. Yashasvi Jaiswal called for a run which was always going to be tight, Virat Kohli nicked one outside off after showing a lot of character during his 86-ball 36 and Rishabh Pant showed zero game awareness when he exposed nightwatchman Akash Deep in front of Scott Boland .It could have been a different story and a much better ending to the day for the visitors but that period of chaos has now put Australia in the driving seat as they still have a 310-run lead, and are just one wicket away from exposing India's lower-order.The momentum switched sides at a rapid pace, largely due to India's own mistakes, as they handed over the day to Australia on a platter. Jaiswal and Kohli had done all the hard work with their 102-run stand but the adrenaline rush got the better of the left-hander who went for a needless single off the last delivery of the 41st over.Jaiswal was batting beautifully and switched gears after completing his half-century as the runs came at a brisk pace after reaching the milestone. Before the mix-up, he had two boundaries and a six, and was in no mood to play for the clock. Just 18 short of what could have been his second hundred of the series, Jaiswal wanted the strike back to possibly have a crack at three-figures before stumps but mix-up not only cost him the wicket but also triggered a collapse.After just 12 deliveries, Kohli poked at a Boland delivery outside the off-stump and night watchman Akash Deep lasted only 13 balls before India lost their third in quick succession.Prior to that, it was India all the way as both Jaiswal and Kohli saw off the challenging period and were looking to cash in as the ball got softer. Kohli, in particular, looked very solid and was comfortably shouldering arms to deliveries he had been otherwise chased in the series. Every time Australia bowlers tempted him for one, Kohli let it go to the wicket-keeper and smiled back.The plan was not a top secret anymore but Kohli had trained his mind better for the fourth Test. He kept leaving, drove deliveries which were under his eye and made the bowlers bowl more towards his body.In the post-day press conference, Steve Smith lavished praise on the India batter and felt he was looking good for the big one today. Not just Kohli, Jaiswal was looking in an ominous mood after seeing off the testing period with the new ball but that mix-up came at the worst possible time for India.There is still some batting left but India need to bat out of their skins to make a contest out of this fixture now. They had it in control for most of the afternoon session but small lapses in concentration reduced them to 164/5 at stumps. Those small lapses are expected to have a big impact on the outcome of the game.",India lose three wickets in just 28 deliveries on Day 2 of Boxing Day Test. Australia still have 310-run lead and are just one wicket away from exposing India's lower-order. Virat Kohli and Yashasvi Jaiswal had put on 102-run stand for the first wicket.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116709151,imgsize-28142,width-400,resizemode-4/116709151.jpg"

ROURKELA: The last time Graham Reid was in Rourkela , he was the head coach of the Indian men’s hockey team and they had just been knocked out of the 2023 FIH World Cup. It wasn’t a happy ending for a man who led India to their first Olympic medal after 41 years at the Tokyo Olympics. However, he is back in India once more and this time as the coach of the Delhi SG Piper team in the newly-revamped Hockey India League ( HIL )Delhi will play the tournament opener against Team Gonasika at the Birsa Munda Stadium on Saturday evening.Reid is more than happy to be back in the country which is like ‘home’ to him, and he can’t wait for the tournament to start. But he understands a tough competition awaits in the league which will see eight teams fight it out for the ultimate prize.“Every coach will have the same challenge and that is making the group come together, making sure that all aspects of the game are covered. And that’s difficult because we haven’t had very much time together,” said Reid on the eve of their tournament opener against Manpreet Singh & Co.“The team that will win is the team that manages to keep on improving. So, you know, teams may not start as well, but it’s how we improve during the tournament that will matter.”Shamsher Singh, one of the co-captains of the Delhi side, meanwhile, pointed out that being fit will be another key aspect of the game. “Since each team will be playing 10 matches it’s important to stay injury free and concentrate on recovery. Then it’s all about giving our best when it matters the most.”While that will be the primary focus for every team, what’s most important is how much the junior India players can learn from it and improve in the coming days.The young stars made good use of the experience at the last HIL and won the Junior World Cup in 2016 in Lucknow and it’s something that the strategy director of Kalinga Lancers David John is hoping to see once again.“It’s exciting for Indian hockey. It’s necessary for Indian hockey that these young junior players receive this exposure to playing at a high level with good quality international and Indian players. It’s good for their development and good for the future of Indian hockey,” said John, who has been working in India for quite some time now.Harmanpreet Singh, captain of the Soorma Hockey Club and the India team, further added, “The Indian team’s success in the Olympics is due to the exposure the league provided us, at a young age. Rubbing shoulders with players you look up to and competing with and against them daily improved us more than we could imagine.”Thus, the league will aim to change the Indian hockey landscape for the better once again but with the tournament happening mostly in one city, besides a couple of matches in Ranchi, it remains to be seen how the players will stay fresh and motivated for more than a month.",Graham Reid is back in India as the coach of the Delhi SG Piper team in the Hockey India League.

MELBOURNE: In just a few seconds, hope gave way to despair here at the 'G'.India appeared to be scripting a great escape when everything unravelled dramatically with stumps in sight. Yashasvi Jaiswal , man of the hour, batting in supreme touch, had been looking fidgety since reaching the half-century mark. Having moved into the eighties, he whipped Scott Boland to mid-on and immediately set off for the run.It was Jaiswal's call, but it was still a tight run. At the other end, Virat Kohli , who had been displaying the kind of discipline which has deserted him in recent times, hopped out as if in response, then immediately turned his back and started ball watching.Faced with having to make that split-second choice, Jaiswal opted for the brain freeze and kept running towards disaster.Having put on 102 fluent runs in pursuit of Australia's steep 474 and rotated strike well till that point, the partnership was blossoming. It even seemed Australia's relentless pace attack had a fight on their hands.By the time Pat Cummins threw the ball in, both batters were stranded at the non-striker's end. The Aussie fielders swooped in like pall bearers of gloom. Cummins missed the stumps but wicketkeeper Alex Carey collected the ball, ran in and whipped off the bails at the striker's end. The fight went out of India.Jaiswal, the man with the penchant for the daddy hundreds, stormed off after gesticulating at Kohli, who expressed helplessness. In walked Akash Deep as nightwatchman, another strange decision by India. Kohli, by now, was distraught, his focus shot to pieces. Boland's next over, first ball, he committed the cardinal sin that has dogged him for a while now: fishing at the fifth-stump line.All afternoon, he had left the ball with supreme anticipation and rare self-control, so much so that Australia had to change their plans for him. Boland cleverly revived the idea. Kohli lunged with the bat, the ball found the edge and Carey was back in action.The dismissal made for the unlikely sight of Kohli trudging off to loud boos from a record Day Two crowd of 85,147 spectators, There was to be more unsavoury drama in store. Kohli, having just copped a fine for shoulder-barging Sam Konstas on Day One, has replaced Mohammed Siraj as the Australian media's enemy No. 1, with some tabloids putting headlines like 'Clown Kohli' on the cover and photo-shopping a ball on to his nose.He had come out looking like the guilty party in the run-out too, and the boos followed him as he entered the dressing room. Kohli walked back out, incensed, and seemed interested in a confrontation when security guards stepped in to defuse the situation.Thirteen balls after the Kohli dismissal, Akash Deep, having had a torrid time against Starc, fended awkwardly at a short one from Boland. The ball careened from the inside edge of his bat to the thigh pad to leg gully's hands. India had lost three wickets for six runs and eventually ended Day Two of the fourth Test at 164/5, still trailing by 310 runs, with Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja left to pick up the pieces on the third morning.Before that run-out, Jaiswal was batting like a dream in favourable conditions. Answering India's call, the man with the penchant for the daddy hundreds appeared to be coasting along against the quicks. With edges not carrying, he unfurled some bold strokes, a couple of good-looking drives and pulls and some excitable ramp shots over the slip cordon.Jaiswal had walked out to bat with Rohit Sharma , who returned to open but found the runs had still chosen not to follow. Demoted to No. 3, KL Rahul unleashed some exquisite drives until a peach of a leg-cutter from Cummins sneaked through, bringing the resolute Kohli to the middle.It isn't an easy time to be Kohli right now, unlike the batting great on the other side, Steve Smith , who rediscovered form with his second consecutive hundred, his 34th Test ton and the 11th against India. After fighting it out in Brisbane and finding some luck along the way, Smith eventually rediscovered his touch and fluency here at the MCG.Having ended Day Two batting on 68, he knocked off the 32 required with minimum fuss on the second morning. Not that it was much of a challenge, with India having begun the day on a bad note as well. Their bowling looked pedestrian apart from Bumrah, who for a while troubled Smith. The fielding was listless and the captaincy uninspiring at times.Smith added 112 brisk runs with Cummins, adding 31 runs in the first seven overs and 60 off the first 14. He hooked Bumrah for six to get into the nineties before a cracking cover drive off Nitish Kumar Reddy got Smith to three figures.Only the bizarre manner of his dismissal, charging down to Akash Deep and dragging one on, would have rankled the perfectionist.It was Smith and Australia's day, and India now find themselves staring at the abyss in this Test. Unless, of course, Rishabh Pant decides it's a good time for another miracle.","Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli had put on 102 fluent runs in pursuit of Australia's steep 474.

(Photo by Martin Keep/AFP via Getty Images)

MELBOURNE: Captain Rohit Sharma may still be calling the shots on the field but as a Test batsman, he finds himself in a very lonely place right now. After Friday's failed attempt to recover from a prolonged slump by reclaiming his regular opening slot, the talk over his immediate future in the format is likely to get louder.On the second day of the fourth Test against Australia, Rohit walked out to bat with Yashasvi Jaiswal for the first time in the series. He only managed three runs off five balls, adding to a growing list of single-digit scores over his past few Tests, both at home and away.The manner of his dismissal, too, was bizarre - a leading edge off a tentative half-pull suggesting he was caught in two minds whether to go for the shot or leave the delivery from counterpart Pat Cummins alone.Perhaps Rohit is unable to trust his muscle memory, a common feature in batters who suffer prolonged run droughts, because he is one of the best exponents of the pull shot otherwise. Perhaps the mind is muddled. Perhaps he could do with a break?In his past 14 Test innings, Rohit averages 11.07 with one half-century. His scores read 6 and 5 in Chennai, 23 and 8 in Kanpur (both against Bangladesh), 2 and 52 in Bengaluru, 0 and 8 in Pune and 18 and 11 in Mumbai (all against New Zealand). On this Australia trip, after missing the first game in Perth, Rohit has batted at No. 6 in Adelaide and Brisbane, scoring 3, 6, and 10 across three innings before Friday's return to the opening slot.Where is Rohit Sharma the Test batsman of 2021, whose memorably constructed second-innings 127 fashioned victory for India at the Oval against England?India need Rohit back at his exhilarating best to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , but for the moment the issues are about his presence affecting the balance of the XI. India won the first Test of the series in Perth under Jasprit Bumrah 's captaincy when Rohit was on paternity leave, with KL Rahul opening instead and playing a significant role in that win.Not wanting to disturb a combo which has just won India an away Test, Rohit, when he returned as captain, agreed to take Rahul's usual middle-lower spot at No. 6 for the next two games. It seems he has not been unable to adjust to the role. Many experts and former captains have also been clamouring for him to return to the top and face the new ball.Perhaps all the chatter just got to Rohit. For the ongoing fourth Test, the in-form Rahul, who looked in good touch on Friday, was pushed down to No. 3 so Rohit could open. The regular No. 3, Shubman Gill , was dropped and a spin-bowling allrounder, Washington Sundar , was instead drafted in.India have failed to pick pacers to support Jasprit Bumrah and instead packed the side with allrounders to provide more batting depth in tough Australian conditions. With the runs not consistently flowing from Virat Kohli's blade either, the pressure has been on the lower middle order to pull off rescue acts.On Friday, after Rohit's dismissal, former India captain Sunil Gavaskar said on air here, ""(These are) tough times for him. There will be a second innings (here) and two more in Sydney. Questions will be asked if he doesn't score in those three innings.""Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting, who has always been an advocate for Rohit opening, expressed concern at the manner of his dismissal. ""That's just a lazy, not switched on, not up for the moment type of shot,"" Ponting said. ""He's been known as one of the best hookers and pullers of the ball since he made his debut but that's just not there. It's nothing. It's not committed, not really looking to be aggressive. He's just looking to tap it on the head.""Then there's the Ashwin factor. The famed off-spinner, one of India's greatest ever match-winners, retired in a huff after the Brisbane Test, ostensibly because he was not picked over Washington Sundar in Perth and not guaranteed a place in the XI for the Melbourne and Sydney Tests. Ashwin refused to be a passenger and left the squad immediately. If a player of his stature could be given the nudge, can the captain be above reproach?At 37, Rohit is at the backend of a glorious career and there are fears he could be in terminal decline as a batsman. In Australia, he'll be hoping a few more innings at the top will help him recover some semblance of his old prolific self. Else, chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar and head coach Gautam Gambhir may need to have a serious conversation with India's captain. Failure in the second innings of the Boxing Day Test will raise speculation to fever pitch.","Rohit Sharma has failed to recover from a prolonged slump as a Test batsman. The 37-year-old has scored just 11 runs in his past 14 Test innings. The manner of his dismissal, too, was bizarre - a leading edge off a tentative half-pull.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116729291,imgsize-39860,width-400,resizemode-4/116729291.jpg"

(Photo by Robert Cianflone/Getty Images)

MELBOURNE: After scoring back-to-back centuries in this series, Steve Smith is the envy of all declining batting greats right now.At 35, the batting giant has engineered the sort of late-career revival at his favourite No. 4 spot that few could have anticipated, cranking up that old run-machine everyone thought had stopped functioning.Since the 110 against England at Lord's in June 2023, Smith went into a prolonged ton drought, the longest of his career, until the hard-earned century in the Gabba Test , followed by Friday's 140 here at the MCG.So prolonged had the slump been that even with the twin tons, his average this year rises only to 36.86 from 18 innings, compared to the career 56.52. A temporary switch to the opening slot had complicated matters.On Friday, he looked at ease with himself, getting into position early, negotiating Bumrah safely, ""finding his hands,"" as he likes to say, all while retaining the extravagant back-and-across trigger movement with which he is comfortable.Throughout the past few weeks, Smith has been at it in the nets, facing throwdowns and putting more thought into the process. Smith has always been a bit obsessed with his own method, sometimes even risking going down the rabbit hole of tampering endlessly with technique, but on the first two days of the fourth Test he seemed to have found a sweet spot he would like to carry with him into next year.For a while over the past year or so, it had seemed that of this generation's Fab Four - Virat Kohli , Smith, Joe Root and Kane Williamson - Smith and Kohli would fade away the fastest. Smith has turned it around. Can Kohli too, who scored a century in Perth but has fallen off since?""You've got to have the faith,"" Smith said, ""Have a bit of trust in what you do. I've played the game for long enough now to know that you can have your ups and downs. When I wasn't scoring runs, I actually felt like I was batting pretty well. There's a difference between being out of form and out of runs. On these wickets, you need a lot of luck as well. I had my fair share (at the Gabba).""Smith also said Kohli was unlucky to get out as he did on Friday, losing his wicket at the first instance of fishing on the fifth-stump line. ""He's a class player, he played really well in Perth for that hundred,"" Smith said, ""He looked really good today. I thought he's in for a good one here. He was disciplined, leaving nicely, making the bowlers come to him a bit more, scoring well through the leg side and when we bowled short.""","Steve Smith scores back-to-back centuries in this series against India. 35-year- old has engineered a late-career revival at his favourite No. 4 spot.

NEW DELHI: The ongoing Boxing Day Test between Australia and India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) witnessed a remarkable debut innings from 19-year-old Sam Konstas, drawing comparisons to the iconic Andrew Symonds from former Australian opener Matthew Hayden.On the 18th anniversary of Symonds' maiden Test century at the MCG against England in 2006, Hayden took to social media to reflect on the parallels between Konstas' fearless batting and Symonds' career-defining knock of 156 runs.Hayden reminisced about batting alongside his ""best mate"" Symonds during that memorable innings, which marked a turning point in the latter's Test career.“18 years ago today, I batted at the MCG with my best mate wearing our baggy green caps for Australia. He made his first Test 100! Watching @samkonstas5 yesterday was exciting, just like I felt standing and watching Simmo batting,” Hayden posted on Instagram.Konstas's debut innings of 60 off 65 balls, laced with audacious shots like reverse scoops against Jasprit Bumrah, drew comparisons to Symonds's raw power and determination.The youngster's contribution helped Australia post an imposing total of 474 in their first innings, becoming the youngest Australian in over 70 years to score a fifty-plus score on debut against India.In response, India's innings got off to a shaky start, with captain Rohit Sharma dismissed cheaply for 3, continuing his poor form in the series. KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal steadied the ship with a patient partnership, but a mix-up between Jaiswal and Virat Kohli resulted in Jaiswal's run-out for 82, triggering a collapse.Kohli, visibly unsettled, fell soon after for 32, while nightwatchman Akash Deep was also dismissed, leaving India reeling at 156/5 by stumps on Day 2.The visitors now face an uphill task, trailing by 310 runs, with Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja unbeaten overnight and tasked with leading India's fightback on Day 3.","Sam Konstas' debut innings drew comparisons to Andrew Symonds' career-defining knock of 156 runs against England in 2006.

NEW DELHI: Corbin Bosch made an impressive unbeaten 81 while Marco Jansen secured two crucial wickets, putting South Africa in a commanding position during the second day of the first Test against Pakistan at SuperSport Park in Centurion on Friday.Batting at number nine, Bosch helped South Africa establish a 90-run first innings advantage. The bowlers capitalised on this lead by claiming three Pakistani wickets before the deficit could be erased.Pakistan concluded the day at 88 for three, trailing by two runs. A South African victory in either match of this two-Test series would secure their maiden World Test Championship final appearance next year.The match was balanced when Aiden Markram departed for 89, leaving South Africa at 213 for eight, marginally ahead of Pakistan's 211. Naseem Shah 's intense bowling spell yielded three wickets as South Africa lost four wickets for 35 runs around lunch.Bosch, maintaining a first-class batting average exceeding 40, played freely whilst partnering with Kagiso Rabada (13) and Dane Paterson (12), transforming a slim advantage into a significant lead. His 93-ball innings included 15 boundaries.The 30-year-old's outstanding debut continued, following his first-innings figures of four for 63, where he recorded the match's fastest delivery at 147kmh.Bosch, whose Test cricketer father Tertius passed away when he was five, initially wasn't considered a primary fast-bowling option this season.However, injuries to senior players and his recent performances earned him selection.Although Bosch shared the new ball with Rabada, he remained wicketless in his three-over spell before leaving the field.The Pakistani opening pair of Saim Ayub and Shan Masood each scored 28, establishing a 49-run partnership before Rabada bowled Ayub.

David Payne eyes England comeback through ILT20 success

READ ALSO:

NEW DELHI: Fresh off an extraordinary domestic season in England, David Payne , the left-arm swing and seam sensation, is poised to make his mark with the Desert Vipers in the upcoming ILT20 .For Payne, the tournament isn’t just about team success; it’s a critical platform to reignite his international career.Speaking on the Vipers Voices podcast, Payne shared his ambitions: “The ILT20 is the perfect stage for me to keep pushing my case (to play for England). The standard of this competition is such that if I can perform well, it will be my way of knocking on the door for England and saying, ‘I am still here.’ It is the perfect showcase to try and get my name back in the fold.”Payne’s impressive run in the 2024 T20 Blast led Gloucestershire to a remarkable title win.His haul of 33 wickets in 17 matches was instrumental in their success. Reflecting on this milestone, he said, “It was a pretty special summer for myself and the team and I put a large part of it down to it being the first summer that I was purely just a white-ball player. Previous to that I played all formats and it takes a lot out of you. Normally going into the Blast season I would have played six or seven red-ball games, bowled hundreds of overs and been pretty fatigued already from the first couple of months of the season.“Being able to go into the Blast campaign feeling really fresh and motivated really did, I think, play a huge part in the success that I had. My body and my mind were a lot fresher. I think it was the first time I entered a Blast campaign being able to give it absolutely 100 per cent of my ability. I was in a great mindset and physical space and everything clicked.”His performances in the Blast catapulted him to third on the all-time wicket-takers list for the tournament, with 193 scalps.“That stat kind of crept up on me last season,” he admitted. “It is something I am very proud of. My focus has always been on evolving as a bowler because staying ahead in the cat-and-mouse game with batters is crucial.”Having honed his skills in the Abu Dhabi T10, Payne is confident in adapting to UAE pitches. “The T10 was a great warm-up, a great introduction to the ILT20 for me,” he noted. “To see the conditions in Abu Dhabi was incredibly useful. The pitches were good, pretty batter-friendly, and it has given me a lot of learnings to take into January.”Payne is optimistic about the Desert Vipers’ prospects. ""(With the Desert Vipers) I would be amazed if we were not up there and challenging for the title this season. I love the bowling group we have got together and I love the fact we have gone left-arm heavy as I think that is going to be such a point of difference. It is attacking and something batters will not have faced too much of,"" he added.“I also think we have such a strong breadth of batting in terms of covering all bases with power and with touch. I just think it is a well-rounded squad that in my eyes should really be competing for the title.""The Vipers kick off their campaign against the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders on day two (January 12) of the tournament, and Payne is ready to spearhead their charge—and potentially his England comeback.",David Payne is poised to make his mark with the Desert Vipers in the upcoming ILT20.

Washington Sundar on Virat Kohli-Yashasvi Jaiswal run-out

NEW DELHI: Legendary cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has shed light on the reason behind India captain Rohit Sharma 's recent struggles with form. Gavaskar expressed apprehension about Rohit's declining reflexes during the Boxing Day Test against Australia in Melbourne.The former Indian captain observed notable issues with the 37-year-old's footwork, which have become particularly noticeable throughout the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .The strategic move to open the innings with Yashasvi Jaiswal in the fourth Test, while shifting KL Rahul to the third position, proved unsuccessful for Rohit. His brief stint at the crease lasted merely 12 deliveries, yielding just three runs before Pat Cummins claimed his wicket in India's first innings.The dismissal occurred when Rohit attempted to execute a half-pull shot to a short-of-length delivery outside the off stump, resulting in a top edge that was caught by Scott Boland at mid-on. Gavaskar noted this dismissal as unusual for Rohit, emphasising his continued difficulties against Cummins's bowling.""That's a shot that he normally plays. The half-pull off the front foot. I think he probably got in two minds whether to go for the proper pull shot or not and then ended up just trying to tap it like catching practice. But that's what happens when you have a gap, when you're 36, 37 years old and you have a long gap between playing cricket,"" Gavaskar said on Star Sports on Rohit's dismissal.In Test cricket, Cummins has proven to be particularly effective against Rohit, having secured his wicket on seven occasions. The Australian captain's superiority is evident in the numbers - he has restricted Rohit to just 127 runs from 199 balls. These statistics clearly demonstrate the Indian skipper's struggles when facing the Australian fast bowler in the longest format of the game.""That is the reason why you're seeing that there is probably not the same sort of footwork as you would expect, because your body is such as you get older. It reacts just a little bit slower. You know, the mind is there. Everything the mind tells you, but the body just doesn't do that. So, if you're being continuous at the age of 37, regularly, no problem. Because you know your bat-speed, everything. The moment you have a break, you must be very, very careful, very, very mindful,"" he added.At the close of play on Day 2, India reached 164/5, trailing Australia's substantial first-innings score of 474 by 310 runs. Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja remained unbeaten with scores of six and four respectively.",Sunil Gavaskar has shed light on the reason behind India captain Rohit Sharma's recent struggles with form.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian batting great Sunil Gavaskar shared how Team India should approach the crucial third day of the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).Speaking on Star Sports, Gavaskar outlined the challenges and opportunities ahead for India as they strive to avoid a daunting follow-on and inch closer to Australia’s formidable first-innings total of 474.“Jadeja batted really well at Gabba, so he needs to bring in the same application here as well,” Gavaskar remarked. “Pant is the kind of player who we know can take the game apart. So we need another—India need another 100-plus partnership. It’s not just about saving the follow-on. India need to spend a little more time at the crease tomorrow. Even if they can take it till post-lunch, they give themselves a very good chance.”On the challenges posed by Nathan Lyon, Gavaskar said: “Nathan Lyon will come into play tomorrow. He hasn’t had much of a role to play in the entire series, but now, with what we saw from Washington Sundar and Ravindra Jadeja bowling, they were getting the ball to grip, turn, and maybe get a little more bounce as well. So Nathan Lyon will certainly enjoy bowling to the left-handers.”Reflecting on Australia’s potential strategy, Gavaskar noted, “India need to put their heads down. Like I said, they have to try and take their first innings past lunch, maybe as close to tea as possible, and therefore get as close as possible to the Australian total. Australia will not give you the follow-on, make no mistake. Even if India fall short of 274, Australia will not give you the follow-on. They'll want to bat you out of the game.”At the close of play on Day Two, India were precariously placed at 164/5, trailing by 310 runs.A dramatic late collapse, triggered by Yashasvi Jaiswal’s unfortunate run-out for 82 and the dismissals of Virat Kohli and nightwatchman Akash Deep, undermined an otherwise steady partnership.With Pant and Jadeja unbeaten overnight, India must muster resilience and discipline to mount a recovery.","Sunil Gavaskar says India need another 100-plus partnership to avoid the follow- on.

Bernardo Silva netted an early strike, but Erling Haaland failed to convert from the spot as Manchester City settled for a 1-1 Premier League draw against Everton in the Boxing Day fixture on Thursday.The defending champions' poor run continues with just one victory in their previous 13 matches across competitions, including a single win in nine league encounters.They currently occupy sixth position with 28 points, trailing leaders Liverpool by 11 points, who have two fixtures remaining. Pep Guardiola 's side risks dropping to eighth by day's end.Everton sits 15th, with a five-point cushion above the relegation places.The Etihad Stadium faithful welcomed Silva's 14th-minute goal with relief. Jeremy Doku delivered a pass behind Everton's defence, allowing Silva to slide and score from a difficult position, with the ball taking a deflection off Jarrad Branthwaite.The goal, which prompted an enthusiastic celebration from Guardiola, ended Everton's run of three consecutive clean sheets.However, City's joy proved brief. Iliman Ndiaye equalised in the 36th minute after Manuel Akanji's failed clearance, with the Senegalese midfielder controlling the ball before dispatching it into the top right corner.City supporters anticipated victory when Haaland stepped up for a penalty following Seamus Coleman's challenge on Savinho, but Jordan Pickford made the save.

Djokovic needs one more Grand Slam trophy for an unprecedented 25th crown, surpassing Margaret Court's 24, and the legend from Serbia is optimistic about achieving it in 2025, beginning his quest with the Australian Open in January.He will begin the season with the Brisbane International starting this week, which will also feature world number one Aryna Sabalenka leading the women' field.This season marks a significant shift as it's the first time in 37-year-old Djokovic's career where none of his traditional 'Big Four' rivals will compete, following the departures of Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray this year. Roger Federer announced his retirement in 2022.Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner decided to skip preparatory tournaments before the year's first major championship, the Australian Open, which starts on January 12.Based on the standards Djokovic sets, 2024 proved difficult, with no Grand Slam victories and only securing the Olympic gold in Paris, before concluding his season in October.The Brisbane tournament features strong competitors including an in-form Grigor Dimitrov, Holger Rune and Frances Tiafoe. Australian Nick Kyrgios joins the lineup after a lengthy absence, having played just one ATP Tour singles match in two years due to injuries.Djokovic will also be seen in men's doubles, partnering Kyrgios.On the women's side of the competition, there are American stars Jessica Pegula and Emma Navarro, ranked seventh and eighth respectively. The field also features former world number two Ons Jabeur and the experienced Victoria Azarenka.World No. 1 Sabalenka, who defeated China's rising star Zheng Qinwen in this year's Melbourne final, experienced an outstanding 2024, culminating in her recognition as WTA Player of the Year this month.The accomplished tennis player, aged 26, demonstrated remarkable success by reaching seven finals and securing four championships, including a successful defence of her Australian Open title, clinching her maiden US Open victory, and winning WTA 1000 tournaments in Cincinnati and Wuhan.She managed to regain the top world ranking from Swiatek, the five-time Grand Slam winner, whose standing faced scrutiny in November when reports emerged about her positive test for prohibited cardiac medication in August.The International Tennis Integrity Agency determined that the breach was unintentional, resulting in a minimal one-month penalty for the Polish athlete.The situation mirrors that of Australian Open champion Sinner, who awaits the World Anti-Doping Agency's verdict regarding his earlier clearance after two positive tests for clostebol traces in March.","Novak Djokovic needs one more Grand Slam trophy for an unprecedented 25th crown, surpassing Margaret Court's 24.

Why did you and Ebden decide not to pursue the partnership in 2025?

What was your thinking behind partnering Nicolás Barrientos?

You partnered Sriram Balaji for the Olympics, was he an option?

You’ve announced you’re playing with Barrientos for just two tournaments, Adelaide and then the Australian Open…

Is 2025 your farewell season?

What did your success in that 12-month stretch from mid-2023 to the summer of 2024 tell you about yourself?

How does the future of Indian tennis look at this stage?

IN NUMBERS

At the start of the year Rohan Bopanna gave himself the best pre-44th birthday gift when he claimed the World No.1 ranking and clinched his first men’s doubles Grand Slam title in a spectacular 2024 Australian Open fortnight, where he became the poster boy for longevity.The Indian rode that wave with Matthew Ebden into the summer after which their season lost some shine, bringing to an end a strong partnership. Bopanna, ranked 15, starts the 2025 season down under in starkly different circumstances – pairing with the 37-year-old Colombian Nicolás Barrientos – but is no less determined to keep going.To me and my coach Scott (Davidoff) it came as a surprise, I don't think either of us expected it. I mean he had some reasons, he wanted to change.Initially, during the US Open, he said he was going to play with Austin Krajicek, but I think that fell apart and then he came back saying he wants to play with me. Then during the Paris Masters the Belgians — Joran Vliegen and Sanders Gille — split, when he decided he wanted to play with Vliegen. I don't know what the real reason behind that was.He was the one available, Ebden said he wanted to play with Joran Vliegen literally five days before Turin (in November). It was so late in the season, everybody already had a partner. One of the reasons to pair with Barrientos (ranked 49) was because there's a good chance for us to be seeded, especially because we’re going into a Grand Slam.It was going to be a random pairing anyway no matter who I played with, so I thought I might as well play with somebody who I can be seeded with at least. Especially since I'm defending the title. Also, he’s very strong off the baseline, he's very quick and makes a lot of balls and that game style could work for me. I've played against him but not really hung out with him so much. Even when I played with Ebden it was similar right.He was also set with another partner, same with Yuki Bhambri.One of the reasons we said only two tournaments is because it depends where we both are ranked after the Australian Open. If I don’t defend points, my ranking drops, so then no way Barrientos and me are getting into Masters or 500 Series draws. I haven't fixed with anybody else after (Australia) because it all depends on where I am ranked and where Barrientos is ranked.Everybody has been asking me the same thing for the last two years. It is tough (to think about retirement) when for the last two years, I've qualified for the season-ending championships. When you're making the ATP Finals it means you have had a good enough season so there is no reason really to stop.As long as I'm feeling fit and physically ready to play the Masters and the Grand Slams, it (retiring) is not even a consideration.The biggest thing was how well I was feeling physically and that translated into how well I ended up playing. As a team Ebden and I were doing incredibly well, we complimented each other beautifully. What changed personally for me was that belief of being able to perform at a high level and not looking at it in terms of whether I was (doing it) at age 40, at the fag end of my career or not.First and foremost for the future of Indian tennis, we need the federation to be sorted out, all tournaments juniors or seniors are determined through a solid federation. We need to create a strong domestic circuit. More than everybody looking to play Futures, Challengers, yes we need that, but I think a strong domestic circuit (is what we need the most). Also, once a player crosses 18 they are kind of lost because there’s no platform for them to transition to the next level so players in that age-group are giving up the sport because it is too expensive to travel. In the domestic circuit, there is hardly any prize money so nobody really wants to travel. The domestic circuit needs to grow, something similar to golf maybe.Bopanna claimed the World No.1 ranking after winning his first major doubles title at the 2024 Australian Open becoming the oldest first-time No. 1 at the age of 43.Bopanna and Ebden won the 2024 Miami Masters. At the age of 44, Bopanna overtook his own record to become the oldest ATP Masters 1000 finalist and champion.",Rohan Bopanna will play with Nicolás Barrientos for just two tournaments in 2025. The World No.15 is determined to keep going after winning the Australian Open. Bopana says the future of Indian tennis is in the juniors.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116646135,imgsize-115188,width-400,resizemode-4/116646135.jpg"

Rohit Sharma: 'Virat Kohli is a modern day great. He will figure it out'

While settled is not a space athletes would choose for themselves given that the race is all about moving forward, it’s equitable usage in the world of doubles and partnerships. Ask Yuki Bhambri .The 32-year-old, mid-career in the two-man team game, played alongside seven partners before settling with the 6-ft-8 Albano Olivetti with whom he contested 16 tournaments in 2024, making four finals and winning two titles, and finishing the year with a top-50 ranking for the first time in his career.“Four finals is good effort,” Bhambri said. “I don't think this was a fantastic season, but from where I was in January to where it ended, it’s good. It's nice to start a season with an existing partnership, that gives us a little bit of an edge.”Bhambri and Olivetti have Brisbane and Adelaide in their plans before the Australian Open in January.The Indo-French combine did well in the ATP 250s but are yet to break through in the higher category events.“We're still finding our feet in bigger events, in some matches we had chances, but some others we were just blown away,” Bhambri said. “This season was more of a learning experience we can do better in the next season thanks to all that we have learnt.”Bhambri, who finished the season with an individual doubles ranking of No. 48, did something he hasn’t done in the last five years, even when his body was broken and his spirits were low. In November he lined up a group of friends for an end-of-season holiday to Norway, ticking off the Northern Lights, which has long been on his bucket list.“We were there for a week, three cities -- Trondheim, Lofoten and Oslo. It was a nice break, a lot of snow, wind and layering (clothing),” Bhambri said, adding, “This was a mixed group, six of us. The good thing that came out of being injured (end of 2018 to early 2022) is that I got to spend a lot of time at home, I became social. I had the opportunity to meet some cool people outside of tennis.”“This holiday happened at a good time, I had a good season, that’s reason to celebrate. Some of the others in the group were also celebrating anniversaries and milestone birthdays so it was just nice,” Bhambri said.The 32-year-old, who was ranked No.1 in the juniors, winning boys singles title in the 2009 Australian Open, said his biggest takeaway from the season was patience.“I remember in January and February, I was really rattled. I was hoping to kick on to the next level… and not having those wins initially was tough,” he said. “Doubles is very fast-paced and unpredictable. You could be going home happy or sad depending on one point literally. I hadn't really experienced that roller-coaster of emotions before.”“I continued to do the work and play the matches with a positive frame of mind, but I do remember going into some events earlier on where you sort of doubted yourself a little bit. I wondered if I belonged in this level or not,” he said.Bhambri shifted to doubles after sitting out three seasons, save for a couple of tournaments, struggling with tendonitis on his right knee.“In singles you can see who the better player is at times,” he said. “In doubles you could bring all the right things to the court and still end up on the losing side.”Bhambri, who climbed to a career best No. 83 in singles in April 2018, learned the importance of being ‘level-headed’ while navigating the storm of competition. It doesn’t always add up in match play, but it is important to persevere.","Yuki Bhambri and Albano Olivetti have settled into doubles partnership.

Rohit Sharma: 'Virat Kohli is a modern day great. He will figure it out'

There’s a quasi-Indian story brewing in world tennis that has set tongues wagging. A Guntur-chili eating, Tollywood-watching teenager is burning the rectangle. Only the icon against his name is the United States flag, the country he was born and raised in.Nishesh Basavareddy , born in Newport Beach, California and grew up in Carmel, Indiana, started the 2024 season ranked No. 457; he’s at a career-high No. 138 in the ATP ranking presently.The 19-year-old enjoyed a rousing run on the Challenger Tour where he made six finals, winning two titles, including one in his last outing in Mexico. The American’s show, racking up a 41-13 record, not only earned him a place in the ATP Next Gen Finals in Jeddah, starting December 18, but also saw him clinch the USTA Australian Open wildcard that secured his spot in the Melbourne Park main draw.Basavareddy studied Data Science at Stanford University for two years before announcing in early December that he was turning professional.The American teenager, bespectacled, with a studious appearance, explained the Collegiate route was what the doctor ordered for him.“I was 17 when I graduated,” he said. “I had a lot of areas where I needed to mature, it was not just physically, as a person also. I had a lot of injuries when I was a junior so I thought it would be good to get a couple more years of matches in college while also having time to develop physically and tennis wise. Turning pro straight away after high school was never really an option for me.”Basavareddy is mentored by two-time Olympic silver medallist and multiple-time major winner Rajeev Ram , who also resides in Carmel, Indiana.“When I moved to Indiana, I started working with the same coach that he (Ram) used to work with and still does,” he said. “We started meeting when he was home from the Tour. Then, when I started to play professional tennis, he gave me advice about what to expect on the Tour and what to expect in this transition.”The teenager’s father Murali Reddy works in the Tech industry while his older brother Nishanth majored in Information Systems, both played tennis, his father more recreationally, while their mother Sai Prasanna is a homemaker.

'Super afraid': Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek doping issues heighten tension among players,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jannik-sinner-and-iga-swiatek-doping-issues-heighten-tension-among-players/articleshow/116601911.cms,"Jannik Sinner (AFP Photo)

Professional tennis players are increasingly worried about unintentional doping violations due to contamination, especially after recent high-profile cases involving Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek . Both players faced doping charges but were eventually cleared. These incidents highlight the challenges athletes face regarding supplement contamination and the complexities of the anti-doping system.Sinner and Swiatek, who both reached the top ranking in professional tennis, incurred substantial expenses to demonstrate the unintentional nature of the banned substances found in their systems. This financial burden raises concerns for players with fewer resources.“A lot of the players I know are quite apprehensive,” former U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu said.Raducanu expressed her concerns about the risk of contamination in supplements and the financial burden of batch testing. Many players are cautious about the supplements they take due to the risk of contamination.“Everything we take, we're aware of the situation and how easily things can be contaminated. There are certain supplements that I may want to take, but I can't take them because they're sold over the counter and not batch tested.”The cost of batch testing, exceeding $1,000, creates a financial barrier for many athletes.Russian tennis player Andrey Rublev , a former world number five, shared similar anxieties about consuming anything he's not entirely certain about. He admitted to being 'super afraid.'Andrea Petroczi, a researcher on anti-doping at Kingston University in London, confirmed the growing apprehension among elite athletes worldwide regarding unintentional doping violations due to contamination. Her research reveals increasing concerns among athletes about the potential consequences of such violations.“(They) expressed fear and anxiety about unintentionally violating anti-doping rules that could have grave consequences on their reputation, careers and livelihoods,” Petroczi explained.Athletes are adopting various precautionary measures to minimize the risk of contamination. These measures include thoroughly checking medications, avoiding unnecessary treatments, and opting for third-party tested supplements.Athletes also meticulously record batch numbers of supplements and medicines. Some even go to the extent of maintaining detailed logs and avoiding specific foods in certain countries. However, they recognize that even these precautions cannot entirely eliminate the risk.“Importantly, it's also crucial to acknowledge that the resources and strategies required for this level of vigilance aren't universally accessible,” Petroczi emphasized.The accessibility of resources and strategies for such vigilance varies across different regions. This disparity in access creates additional challenges for athletes in certain areas.“There is a clear 'Global North'/'Global South' divide, with disparities in education, resources and support systems, leaving many athletes more vulnerable.”Jannik Sinner's case involved trace amounts of clostebol, an anabolic androgenic steroid. He successfully demonstrated to doping authorities that the substance entered his system through massages administered by his physiotherapist.Despite being cleared, Sinner faces a potential ban of up to two years due to an appeal by the World Anti-Doping Agency. The ongoing appeal creates uncertainty regarding Sinner's future participation in professional tennis.Iga Swiatek, who tested positive for trimetazidine, a hormone and metabolic modulator, served a one-month ban. She attributed the positive test to contamination of her sleep medication.Swiatek revealed the significant financial costs she incurred in defending her case, including legal fees and expert opinions. She spent $70,000 on a lawyer and over $15,000 on expert opinions.“Importantly, it's also crucial to acknowledge that the resources and strategies required for this level of vigilance aren't universally accessible,” Petroczi emphasized.The handling of Sinner and Swiatek's cases contrasts with the experiences of other players, such as Simona Halep and Tara Moore , who have criticized the anti-doping system for lengthy delays in their cases. The contrasting experiences highlight inconsistencies in the handling of doping cases.The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) assumed responsibility for tennis's anti-doping program in 2022. The ITIA was formed by the seven governing bodies of tennis after a comprehensive review of the previous system, which was overseen by the International Tennis Federation.Sinner and Swiatek's cases are the most high-profile investigations undertaken by the ITIA since it took over. Both players held the world number one ranking when they failed their tests, further highlighting the significance of these cases.The ITIA asserts that all doping cases are handled impartially, based on evidence and facts, irrespective of a player's ranking, name, or nationality. However, concerns about potential discrepancies in the system persist.Petroczi highlighted the impact of limited access to legal representation and advanced analytical testing on an athlete's ability to effectively contest a doping case . These limitations create further disparities within the system.Being unable to access legal representation and advanced analytical testing would impact an athlete's ability to fight a doping case, Petroczi added, and sports federations and anti-doping organisations had to address this disparity in resources.Addressing the disparity in resources available to athletes requires collective efforts from sports federations and anti-doping organizations. These efforts should focus on ensuring equitable access to expert support and transparency in processes.“Efforts could include providing equitable access to expert support, ensuring transparency in processes, and exploring ways to mitigate the impact of resource gaps,” Petroczi suggested.Unlike athletes in many other sports, tennis players are essentially self-employed. Therefore, any time away from the game due to a doping ban or related legal battles directly impacts their income.Andrey Rublev advocated for quicker rulings in cases of accidental contamination and a degree of flexibility in the anti-doping rules. He believes the current system is overly strict and creates undue fear among players.“Of course, you want to have a clean sport,” Rublev stated.He emphasized the importance of maintaining a clean sport while also expressing concerns about the strictness of the current rules. He believes the system needs to be more flexible to avoid penalizing players for unintentional violations.“But you also want (it to be) not so strict because then you make all the tennis players so afraid that even those situations (that are not you fault) cost you a year.”The current system can lead to significant penalties, including lengthy bans, even in cases of accidental contamination. This creates a climate of fear among players.“It shouldn't be like that.”",Professional tennis players are increasingly worried about unintentional doping violations due to contamination.

Anmol Kharb and Anupama Upadhyay, representing Haryana, clinched the last two national titles, showcasing dominance in the women's competition.

Anmol made news earlier in the year, helping India win gold in the Badminton Asia Team Championships in Malaysia.""There are ranking tournaments in North now.

""Earlier, there were just government centres with a huge number of kids. But private centres are smaller and more focused,"" said Malik.With the Haryana youngsters impressing at various levels, their progress will be closely monitored. The likes of Anmol, 17, and Unnati amongst others will be in focus as India look to carry on the legacy of Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu ""If these girls can continue with the kind of passion they have now, they can be the next Sindhu and Saina (Nehwal).

Head coach feels lucrative prize money & better scheduling could draw top stars

BENGALURU: Over the past five years, the number of Indian star shuttlers featuring in the individual events at the Senior national badminton championship has dwindled sharply. The ongoing competition at the Karnataka Badminton Association (KBA) here is no different. Of the six Indian men ranked inside the top 50 in the BWF rankings, only Satish Kumar Karunakaran, ranked 45, is competing, while Anupama Upadhyaya (ranked 46) and Aakarshi Kashyap (47) are the top-ranked women players in fray.As a result, Badminton Association of India (BAI) secretary general Sanjay Mishra recently said the federation in future could make the premier domestic event mandatory.India head coach Pullela Gopichand remarked, ""It’s always a challenge when you want (top) athletes to play two circuits, international and national, or national and state. Ideally, there should be only one calendar,"" he said here Sunday.""…the importance of the national championship has gone down. How do we revive it?"" he questioned.Scheduling is one of the key reasons for top players not featuring in the nationals. With the competition played at the year’s end, it is internationally offseason and an ideal resting period for the players. It is also the phase during which many of them begin preparations for the next season, which starts in early January.With star players focusing on major international events, which offer bigger prize money and ranking points, how can a player be convinced to play in the nationals?""You must give them benefits. Making it mandatory is one way, but they could just come, walk the first day, lose a match and walk off. That’s not the purpose. So, you want them to come here prepared and perform. So, either the prize money needs to be at a point where it is motivating or certain things such as an honour or a facility should be there,"" said Gopi.He also suggested the duration of the competition be reduced to three days.","Head coach feels lucrative prize money & better scheduling could draw top stars.

Franchise boom vs Test cricket: Tom Moody’s honest take

Poll Is Brendon McCullum the right coach for England despite recent failures? Yes, he deserves more time. No, it's time for a change.

NEW DELHI: England head coach Brendon McCullum is under mounting scrutiny after another humbling Ashes tour Down Under, and former spinner Monty Panesar has floated a bold alternative: Ravi Shastri . With England losing the Ashes inside 11 days and trailing 0-3 with two Tests remaining, Panesar believes a rethink at the top may be inevitable — and that Shastri is uniquely qualified for the job.Speaking to journalist Ravi Bisht on his YouTube channel, Panesar argued that England need a coach who understands how to beat Australia in their own conditions, both tactically and mentally. “You have to think: who exactly knows how to beat Australia?” Panesar said. “How do you take advantage of Australia’s weaknesses, mentally, physically, and tactically? I think Ravi Shastri should become England’s next head coach. ”Panesar’s case rests squarely on Shastri’s record. Under his stewardship, India won back-to-back Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in Australia — first in 2018/19, India’s maiden series triumph there, and again in 2020/21. The latter victory was particularly remarkable, coming after India were bowled out for 36 in Adelaide and despite a squad ravaged by injuries.McCullum, appointed after England’s 4-0 Ashes defeat, initially transformed the Test side alongside captain Ben Stokes . England won 10 of their first 11 matches, but that momentum has stalled.Since then, England have lost 16 of their next 33 Tests and failed to win marquee five-match series against Australia or India.Despite the noise, McCullum has reiterated his desire to continue, though he acknowledged his future may not be in his hands. Contracted until the 2027 ODI World Cup, he remains motivated even amid criticism.Panesar’s intervention, however, reframes the debate. For him, the question is simple: who knows how to win in Australia? His answer — Ravi Shastr i— adds a compelling twist to England’s coaching conversation.","Former spinner Panesar believes Shastri is uniquely qualified for the job.

Naseem Shah interview: Pakistan bowler opens up on bouts with injuries and tough recovery

Poll Should Australia maintain the pace-heavy strategy moving forward in the series? Yes, it's effective No, need a balanced attack

Australia XII for fourth Test:

Travis Head, Jake Weatherald, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith (c), Usman Khawaja, Alex Carey (wk), Cameron Green, Mitchell Starc, Scott Boland, Brendan Doggett, Michael Neser, Jhye Richardson

Australia are in no rush to lock in their playing XI for the Boxing Day Test, with stand-in captain Steve Smith revealing selectors want another close look at a “quite furry” Melbourne Cricket Ground surface before finalising their pace-heavy attack.Despite confirming Australia will field an all-pace bowling unit for the fourth Ashes Test, Smith said the exact combination of quicks will only be settled after a final inspection of the wicket on Friday. Brendan Doggett, Michael Neser and returning fast bowler Jhye Richardson are vying for the last two bowling spots.“We’ve landed on a 12, we just want to take a look at the wicket tomorrow,” Smith said. “It’s got about 10mm of grass on it, quite furry, quite green. I dare say it’s going to offer quite a bit, particularly on day one with the weather looking cold and overcast.”Smith added that conditions through the week appear “conducive” for seam bowling, reinforcing Australia’s decision to go without a spinner, even if Nathan Lyon had been available.“If Nathan was available, we’d probably still be having the same conversation,” Smith said.“So it’s certainly nothing to do with Todd Murphy’s skill.”The delay in naming the XI also comes amid enforced changes. Regular skipper Pat Cummins has been rested for workload management, while Lyon’s hamstring injury has ruled him out for the remainder of the series. Smith returns to captain the side after missing the third Test with an inner-ear issue, saying he is now feeling “100 per cent”.“It was a shame to miss that one,” Smith said. “I was watching from the hotel and wished I could have been out there, but it was the right call at the time.”Smith’s return reshapes the batting order. Usman Khawaja, who made 82 and 40 after a late recall in Adelaide, will drop to No.5, while Alex Carey remains at six following his match-winning century in the Ashes-clinching third Test. Cameron Green is set to bat at seven, edging out Josh Inglis.The bowling focus, however, remains the main talking point. Neser is chasing his first red-ball Test appearance, Doggett offers continuity after Brisbane, and Richardson is closing in on his first Test in four years.“It’s exciting to see Richardson back into the fold,” Smith said. “We know the skills he can possess. When he’s had opportunities at this level, he’s been outstanding.”Australia hold a 3-0 lead in the series, but Smith insisted selection decisions will be dictated purely by conditions, not the scoreboard, as the hosts look to make full use of what could be a lively Boxing Day pitch.","Australia will field an all-pace bowling unit for the fourth Ashes Test.

A Father's Pride: How RR, Dravid & Vikram Shaped Vaibhav Suryavanshi

NEW DELHI: India’s cricket world has found a new talking point, and his name is Vaibhav Sooryavanshi. At just 14 years old, the young batter continues to stun fans, experts, and former players with performances that feel almost unreal for his age. His latest heroics in domestic cricket have once again put him firmly in the spotlight.Veteran politician and cricket enthusiast Shashi Tharoor summed up the excitement around the teenager with a bold comparison. Reacting to Sooryavanshi's latest feat, Tharoor wrote on X, ""The last time a fourteen year old showed such prodigious cricketing talent, it was Sachin Tendulkar — and we all know what became of him. What are waiting for? Vaibhav Suryavanshi for India!""Sooryavanshi made headlines on Wednesday after blasting a breathtaking 36-ball century in the Vijay Hazare Trophy Plate league opener for Bihar against Arunachal Pradesh at the JSCA Oval Ground.This became the second-fastest century by an Indian in List A cricket, only behind Anmolpreet Singh’s 35-ball ton last season.Globally, it stands as the joint fourth-fastest List A century ever.The young left-hander did not stop there. He raced to 150 in just 54 balls and was finally dismissed for a staggering 190 off 84 deliveries.Bihar piled up a massive 574 for 6 in 50 overs, before bowling Arunachal Pradesh out for 177 to seal a crushing 397-run victory.Earlier this month, Sooryavanshi smashed an unbeaten 108 off 61 balls in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy against Maharashtra at Eden Gardens. That knock made him the youngest player ever to score a century in the tournament, at just 14 years and 250 days.He also holds the record for the highest score by an Indian in U19 Asia Cup history, scoring 171 off 95 balls against the UAE.The teenager has already scored centuries against Australia U19 and for India A, including a jaw-dropping 144 off 42 balls in the Rising Stars Asia Cup.","At just 14 years old, Vaibhav Sooryavanshi continues to stun fans, experts, and former players.

The return of war

A story that lives on

On Christmas morning in 1914, something happened that no military plan could have predicted and no weapon could have forced. In the middle of World War I , one of the bloodiest conflicts in human history, soldiers laid down their guns and stepped out of their trenches. And what did they do? They ended up playing football.For a few precious hours, war made way for humanity. This moment, now known as the Christmas Truce, remains one of the most powerful stories ever told about football and peace.Fought between the Allied Powers, backed by France, Britain, Russia, later joined by the US, Italy, and Japan, and the Central Powers, led by Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria, World War I had erupted in the summer of 1914.Europe was torn apart as nations rushed into battle with confidence and somewhat misplaced optimism.Many soldiers believed the war would be short.“Home by Christmas,” they said.Instead, by December, the war had stalled into a brutal deadlock. Soldiers on both sides were trapped in muddy trenches across Belgium and northern France.Life there was unbearable. Freezing cold, constant shelling, disease, hunger, and fear became daily companions.Young men, many of whom were barely out of school, faced death every hour.Christmas was approaching, but joy felt impossible.On the night of December 24, something strange happened along parts of the Western Front. British soldiers heard singing coming from the German trenches.At first, they suspected a trick. But the tune was unmistakable. The Germans were singing Christmas carols.“Stille Nacht”, which translates to Silent Night in English, floated gently through the cold air. British troops replied with their own songs.Soon, laughter replaced gunfire. Shouts of “Merry Christmas!” crossed no man’s land, the deadly strip of ground that usually meant instant death.Against all logic, the blazing sounds of gunfire went silent.As dawn broke on Christmas Day, soldiers cautiously climbed out of their trenches. Hands raised. No weapons. No orders. No one fired.British and German soldiers met in the middle. They shook hands. They smiled awkwardly. They exchanged cigarettes, chocolate, buttons, badges, and even small gifts sent from home.Photographs of loved ones were shown. Stories were shared. For the first time, soldiers saw the faces of the men they had been told to hate. They discovered something shocking. The enemy looked just like them.Then came the football. In some places, it was a proper leather football. In others, it was a bundle of rags tied together. It didn’t matter. There were no goalposts, no referee, no rules. Hwever, soldiers marked goals with caps or coats. Their boots were heavy, and the ground was frozen and uneven. But they couldn't care less.British soldiers kicked the ball with German soldiers. Scores were kept loosely, if at all.Some accounts claim the Germans won one match 3–2. Others say the result didn’t matter, because the real victory was simply playing.Soldiers used the calm to recover bodies that had been lying in no man’s land for weeks. Joint burial services were held. Prayers were said together.Men who would soon be ordered to kill each other stood side by side in silence.Many later wrote letters home describing how surreal it felt.One British soldier wrote that it seemed “too wonderful to be real.” Another admitted he struggled afterwards to fire at men he had just shared laughter with.The Christmas Truce was never officially approved. High-ranking officers were furious when they learned what had happened. To them, the truce threatened discipline and the will to fight.Orders were quickly sent down the line. By December 26, the guns roared again. The war resumed its brutal course. Many of the men who played football that day would be killed in the months that followed.For years, the Christmas Truce was pushed aside. Military leaders feared it showed too much humanity in war. Some reports were censored. Others were ignored. But stories have a way of surviving.Letters were found in attics. Diaries were published. Veterans spoke quietly of that day when the war stopped making sense. Slowly, the truth emerged.Football already belonged to everyone in 1914. It was played in England, Germany, France, and beyond. It needed no shared language. No explanation. You just kicked the ball.That simplicity made football powerful. It reminded soldiers of home. Of weekends. Of joy. Of life before the trenches.Football did not end the war. But it proved that hatred was learned, and humanity was natural.Today, more than a century later, the Christmas Truce is remembered across the football world. Memorial matches are held. Statues stand near former battlefields. Clubs and fans share the story every December.Because on Christmas Day in 1914, football did something extraordinary. It reminded the world that before we are soldiers, enemies, or nations, we are human beings. And sometimes, a simple game is enough to make us remember that.","In the middle of World War I, soldiers laid down their guns and stepped out of their trenches. For a few precious hours, war made way for humanity. This moment, now known as the Christmas Truce, remains one of the most powerful stories ever told about football and peace.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126163701,imgsize-106194,width-400,resizemode-4/soldiers-playing-football-in-no-man39s-land-a-year-after-the-christmas-truce-in-1914-photo-credit-universal-history-archiveuiggetty-images.jpg"

NEW DELHI: On his return to domestic cricket, India's batting stalwart Virat Kohli produced another eye-catching performance as Delhi started their Vijay Hazare Trophy campaign with a thrilling four-wicket win over Andhra in Bengaluru on Wednesday.Playing at the BCCI Centre of Excellence, Delhi chased down the target of 299 and won the match, thanks mainly to Kohli’s masterclass with the bat.Delhi won the toss and chose to bowl first. Andhra made good use of the opportunity and posted a strong total of 298 for 8 in their 50 overs.Ricky Bhui was the standout performer for Andhra.He played an excellent knock of 122 runs from 105 balls, hitting 11 fours and seven sixes.

He amassed 74 runs from just 44 balls.His attacking approach put pressure on the Andhra bowlers early in the chase.After Arya got out, Virat Kohli took full control of the innings.Now retired from T20Is and Test cricket, Kohli showed his experience in the longer format of the game.He paced his innings perfectly and found the gaps with ease. Kohli scored a magnificent 131 runs from 101 balls, courtesy of 14 fours and three sixes.In doing so, Kohli also surpassed Sachin Tendulkar to become the fastest player to reach 16,000 List A runs. The 37-year-old reached the milestone in his 330th innings during the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy, compared to Tendulkar’s 391 innings.Nitish Rana gave Kohli excellent support from the other end. Rana played a quick and fearless knock of 77 runs from 55 balls.Together, Kohli and Rana stitched a match-winning partnership that pushed Delhi closer to the win.Although Delhi lost a few wickets towards the end, the hard work was already done. The team reached the target in just 37.4 overs. Harsh Tyagi (4) and Navdeep Saini (5) stayed till the end to seal the win.Nevertheless, Wednesday saw Kohli's brilliance on display as his innings helped Delhi begin their tournament on a high note.","Delhi beat Andhra by four wickets in Vijay Hazare Trophy.

NEW DELHI: Bihar rewrote the history books in emphatic fashion on Wednesday, piling up the highest team total ever recorded in List A cricket during their Vijay Hazare Trophy 2025–26 Plate Group match against Arunachal Pradesh in Ranchi. Powered by breathtaking centuries and a relentless assault that lasted the full 50 overs, Bihar amassed a staggering 574/6, eclipsing the previous world record of 506/2 set by Tamil Nadu — also against Arunachal Pradesh — in the same tournament in 2022.At the heart of the carnage was Bihar captain Sakibul Gani (128 not out off 40 balls), who etched his name into the record books by smashing the fastest List A century by an Indian. Gani raced to his hundred in just 32 balls, surpassing Anmolpreet Singh’s 35-ball effort from last season, and provided the final, brutal flourish to an innings that had already spiralled beyond control for the opposition.While Gani supplied the exclamation point, the foundation — and much of the spectacle — was laid by 14-year-old prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi. Already one of the most talked-about names in Indian age-group cricket, Suryavanshi produced a knock that bordered on the unreal, hammering 190 off just 84 balls.His innings featured a jaw-dropping 15 sixes and 16 fours, as he brought up his century in only 36 deliveries, now the third-fastest by an Indian in List A cricket.In the process, Suryavanshi became the youngest centurion in List A history at 14 years and 272 days, eclipsing the long-standing record held by Pakistan’s Zahoor Elahi. Only Jake Fraser-McGurk (29 balls) and AB de Villiers (31 balls) have reached a List A hundred quicker worldwide than Gani.The run-fest did not end there. Ayush Loharuka (116 off 56) also registered a century, ensuring Bihar never lost momentum after choosing to bat first. Arunachal Pradesh’s bowlers, struggling for penetration and consistency, were unable to stem the flow as boundaries rained in all directions through the innings.The sheer scale of the achievement — 574 runs in a 50-over match — underlines the extraordinary nature of the performance.","Bihar shattered List A cricket history, posting a world-record 574/6 against Arunachal Pradesh.

Kohli, Rohit, Surya, Pant: Who has the most to prove in Vijay Hazare?

Crucial game time ahead of

New Zealand ODIs

BENGALURU: Virat Kohli 's much-anticipated return to the M Chinnaswamy Stadium was put on hold on Tuesday after the Bengaluru city police denied permission to stage the seven Group D Vijay Hazare Trophy matches at the venue.The venues had been rejigged last week to move Delhi's matches — against Andhra (Dec 24) and Gujarat (Dec 26), featuring Kohli — from the KSCA Alur Stadium to Chinnaswamy Stadium amid concerns over crowd management at the outskirts venue, some 40-km west of the Bengaluru stadium. The matches will now be held at the BCCI Centre of Excellence (CoE).On Monday, a committee comprising the city police commissioner and officials from the public works department, fire and emergency services, and the health department inspected the Chinnaswamy Stadium and submitted its report to Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) commissioner Maheshwar Rao, who heads the panel. The committee later met KSCA officials, led by president and former India pacer Venkatesh Prasad, to discuss the implementation of the Justice Michael Cunha Commission report, which outlined 17 recommendations.While discussions were ongoing, KSCA is learnt to have simultaneously approached the CoE as a backup venue. Since there were no other matches scheduled at the three grounds inside the premises, once the talks with the government agencies fell through, the matches were shifted immediately.The shift ends weeks of uncertainty over Kohli's return to the Chinnaswamy Stadium for the first time since the June 4 stampede outside the venue during RCB's IPL victory celebrations, which claimed 11 lives. Following the incident, several police officials — including the commissioner and other IPS officers — were suspended.“Hence, the police department does not want to face such a situation again. Fingers will be pointed at us, irrespective of where the fault lies,” a police officer said.In a statement, KSCA said: “Based on the recommendations of the Review Committee, permission for conducting matches at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium is not finding favour. KSCA respects this decision and places on record its gratitude to the Government of Karnataka for considering the request at the cabinet level.”Teams were informed of the venue change, triggering hurried preparations at the CoE on the city's outskirts.Kohli and wicketkeeperbatter Rishabh Pant joined the Delhi squad for net practice on Tuesday. The duo trained for about an hour, alongside teammates including Ishant Sharma and Navdeep Saini. Kohli hit the nets around noon and also spent time with his teammates.Although the CoE, which was earlier housed inside the Chinnaswamy Stadium, now moved to the sprawling premises more than a year ago with all fitness and rehabilitation processes conducted here, this is Kohli's maiden visit to the facility.The matches will now be held on grounds Two and One, respectively. Both matches will be played behind closed doors, as there is no provision for spectators at the CoE.With India scheduled to play 21 ODIs in the build-up to the 2027 World Cup, the two matches, which have been mandated by the BCCI, will give Kohli some game time ahead of the three-match ODI series against New Zealand beginning on Jan 11.Kohli comes into the tournament on the back of some stellar batting performances against South Africa in the three-match home series earlier this month. He scored 302 runs, including two tons.",Virat Kohli's much-anticipated return to the M Chinnaswamy Stadium was put on hold on Tuesday.

Why Rohit Sharma got really emotional at a promotional event

England's managing director of men's cricket Rob Key has said the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) will investigate reports of excessive drinking by players during their mid-Ashes break, after videos circulating on social media raised fresh questions about the team's conduct on tour.England have already lost the Ashes after defeats in the first three Tests, allowing Australia to retain the urn in just 11 days of on-field action. Attention has now shifted off the field following the squad's stay in Noosa on Queensland's Sunshine Coast between the second and third Tests — a long-planned stop intended to help players relax during the gruelling tour.A video that emerged on Tuesday appeared to show opener Ben Duckett struggling to remember how to return to his hotel while speaking to members of the public. In the clip posted on X, Duckett is asked whether he knows how to get home, to which he appears to reply, “No,” before continuing the conversation in a disoriented manner. Another video showed batter Jacob Bethell dancing in a nightclub, though Bethell has not featured in the Test series so far.The ECB said in a brief statement that it was aware of the content circulating online but would not comment further until the facts were established.Speaking in Melbourne ahead of the fourth Test, Key said he would not tolerate over-indulgence if evidence emerged. “If there's things where people are saying that our players went out and drank excessively, then of course we'll be looking into that,” Key said. “Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol for an international cricket team is not something that I'd expect to see at any stage.”Key added that initial feedback suggested the players had behaved responsibly. “From everything that I've heard so far, they actually were pretty well behaved. Very well behaved. They sat down, had lunch, had dinner, didn't go out late… had the odd drink. I don't mind that. If it goes past that, then that's an issue.”Duckett's form has dipped sharply during the Ashes, managing a top score of 29 across six innings after arriving in Australia with strong credentials. Key also revealed he had previously looked into reports of players drinking on the eve of a one-day international in New Zealand, calling it a “wake-up call”.“I don't mind players having a glass of wine over dinner,” Key said. “Anything more than that, I think is ridiculous.”",England have already lost the Ashes after defeats in the first three Tests.

Poll What is the biggest challenge facing the U-19 team development? Lack of coaching clarity Selection issues Player readiness for international cricket

NEW DELHI: With the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) planning to review the U-19 team's performance in the recent U-19 Asia Cup, the focus is likely to fall on the Centre of Excellence's (CoE) overall role in player development.TOI understands that concerns have been raised about the process of grooming players over the last four years. It is learnt that the board may have to work on getting the Indian team management, selectors and the CoE back in sync.Sources said there seems to be a lack of clarity on the roles of the CoE coaching staff and the selectors. VVS Laxman has recently got a two-year extension as the head of cricket at the CoE and may have to rework his involvement in the process of coaching.“There is some confusion about role definition. Laxman is firmly in charge of making decisions about U-19 teams. He even has a major say in appointing captains. When Rahul Dravid was head of cricket, he was actively involved in the selection of India ‘A' players because he was the one who was devising programmes for each player. At the moment, Laxman doesn't have much say in the India ‘A' process,” a BCCI source said.Besides the big loss to Pakistan in the U-19 Asia Cup, the India ‘A' team failed to make the final of the Rising Stars Asia Cup last month.The major concern of team management is that the players who are coming through the ranks are not close to finished products ready for the international level. Very few players successfully graduate to senior cricket from the age-group level.With the CoE beginning operations this year, Laxman, it is understood, is currently consumed by administrative work. The coaching staff at the CoE is going through a major overhaul. Fast bowling coach Troy Cooley's role has also been under the scanner, with very few pacers showing much improvement in skills. The board is set to relieve him of his duties on the premise that he is turning 60.Incidentally, Laxman, unlike Dravid, doesn't travel much with the developmental teams. “Most of Laxman's overseas assignments have been with second string Indian teams when the main team is away on Test assignments. It needs to be seen if he can travel more with the developmental teams,” the source said.Recently, Jitesh Sharma was sent for the Rising Stars Asia Cup as captain on the insistence of the senior selection committee. However, Jitesh had a major say in playing combinations and strategies in the tournament, which is not a norm with developmental sides. These calls are taken by the coaching staff in consultation with the selectors.",Concerns have been raised about the process of grooming players over the last four years.

:

England suffered another blow to their Ashes campaign on Wednesday with pace spearhead Jofra Archer ruled out for the remainder of the series due to a side strain, while batsman Ollie Pope was dropped for the fourth Test against Australia.Archer has been England’s standout bowler across the first three Tests, shouldering a heavy workload of 80 overs and taking nine wickets.He will be replaced by Gus Atkinson, who will lead the pace attack alongside Josh Tongue, Brydon Carse and captain Ben Stokes. Will Jacks keeps his place as the frontline spin option.The setback compounds England’s problems as they head into the Melbourne Test starting Friday, already trailing the series 3–0 and playing for pride. They are also without express quick Mark Wood, who managed only 11 overs on tour before a knee injury ended his campaign.Pope paid the price for a run of poor form at number three, with Jacob Bethell coming into the side as the only other change.

Swastik Samal on Wednesday produced an awe-inspiring innings to headline Odisha's Vijay Hazare Trophy 2025–26 opener. Stamping his authority with a stunning double century for Odisha against Saurashtra, the 25-year-old opener smashed 212 runs.Playing at the KSCA Cricket Ground, the batter came up with a performance that will be remembered for a long time.Odisha were put in to bat first after Saurashtra skipper Harvik Desai won the toss.The start was far from ideal. Early wickets fell quickly, and Odisha were struggling at 59 for 3 inside the first 12 overs.At that stage, the pressure was firmly on the batting side, and a big total looked unlikely.That is when Swastik Samal took charge.Calm under pressure, he decided to build his innings brick by brick.He began cautiously but soon played himself in as the youngster found gaps rather than forcing shots.His confidence grew with every over, and soon he was batting with complete control.Samal reached his half-century in 53 balls and brought up his maiden List A hundred in 104 deliveries.The turning point of the innings was the partnership between Samal and Odisha captain Biplab Samantray.The pair added a huge 261 runs for the fourth wicket. Samantray played an excellent supporting role, having amassed a quick 100 off 91 balls while hitting seven fours and three sixes.Together, they dismantled the Saurashtra bowling attack.His final tally of 212 runs included 21 fours and eight sixes. He was eventually dismissed in the final over, but by then the damage had been done.Odisha finished with an imposing 345 for 6 in their 50 overs.It was his first-ever List A century, and he turned it into a double hundred in style.With this innings, he became only the ninth batter in Vijay Hazare Trophy history to score a double century.His score of 212 is now the joint fourth-highest individual total in the tournament, matching Sanju Samson’s unbeaten 212 from 2019.Samal also broke Odisha’s long-standing List A record, surpassing the previous best of 145 set in 2005.However, with Vishvaraj Jadeja (50), Sammar Gajjar (132), and Chirag Jani (86) putting up some incredible performances, Saurashtra chased down the target of 346 in 48.5 overs and won the match by five wickets.","Swastik Samal scored 212 runs for Odisha in their Vijay Hazare Trophy opener.

Why Rohit Sharma got really emotional at a promotional event

Star England batter Harry Brook is just seven runs away from completing 3000 Test runs. Brook, currently in Australia for the Ashes, is set to feature in the fourth Test at Melbourne, which starts on December 26.If Brook scores seven runs in his next Test innings, he will equal the former England player Denis Compton (57 innings) as the second-fastest batter to score 3000 Test runs for England, as per ESPNcricinfo.Coming to the Ashes, Brook's start to the ongoing Ashes five-match series has reflected England's overall performance, showing moments of impressive cricket but also frustrating lapses that have enabled Australia to secure an unassailable 3-0 series lead.Although Brook has scored 173 runs--more than any of his teammates except for No 1-ranked batter Joe Root--he has managed only one half-century in six innings, with several of his dismissals coming at pivotal moments for England.The Ben Stokes-led England side have been outplayed in all departments by Australia in the three matches that have been played so far.In the third Ashes Test at the Adelaide Oval, Australia won the toss and batted first but struggled early, falling to 94/4 owing to impressive bowling by Jofra Archer and Brydon Carse. However, veteran Usman Khawaja (82) and Alex Carey (106) revived the innings, helping Australia post 371.Archer starred with 5/53 for England, supported by Josh Tongue and Will Jacks.In England's first innings, Nathan Lyon (2/70) and Pat Cummins (3/70) restricted big partnerships, but Ben Stokes (83) and Archer (51) put together a century stand to reach 286, still trailing by 85. Boland took three wickets to finish off the tail.Australia's second innings saw Travis Head (170) and Carey (72) dominate, setting a total of 349. England, chasing a record 435, lost early wickets and struggled despite partnerships from Joe Root (39), Harry Brook (56), Jamie Smith (60), and Will Jacks (47). Key contributions from Carse (39*) helped, but England were eventually bowled out for 352.Starc, Cummins, and Lyon were Australia's standout bowlers.

Why Rohit Sharma got really emotional at a promotional event

Ahead of the 2026 season, Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) have bolstered their bowling resources at the mini-auction, but questions remain over their batting depth, especially in the lower middle order, according to former India opener Aakash Chopra Chopra stated on JioStar, ""LSG has kept Rishabh Pant at number three, but the batting order remains a question mark. Pant can play higher, and last season's top order was exceptional—three of the top four batsmen scored over 500 runs, which is very rare. The real issue has been the lower order; at five, six, and seven, players like David Miller couldn't consistently deliver in last season.""""This season, LSG have more options in bowling with (Wanindu) Hasaranga, Mohammed Shami, Avesh Khan, Mayank Yadav, along with Akash Singh, Prince Yadav, and Arjun Tendulkar. Despite these improvements, the lower-order batting remains a concern that hasn't been fully addressed,"" added Chopra.Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan also acknowledged the positives in LSG’s bowling signings but shared similar worries about the batting unit.""Looking at Anrich Nortje and Hasaranga, LSG has very strong options, especially in the fast-bowling department, which was much needed. If the fast bowlers stay fit, they form a formidable unit.“Hasaranga is a big benefit - last year, there was a lack of trust from captain Rishabh Pant in Ravi Bishnoi. Hasaranga, bought for 2 crore, is a solid and cost-effective addition.“However, with batsmen like Ayush Badoni and Abdul Samad, LSG could have done with one more top-class batter. I was hoping for someone like Livingstone. Overall, there’s still a need for at least five more high-quality batsmen in the squad,"" Pathan noted.LSG’s decision to spend Rs 8.6 crore on Australian wicketkeeper Josh Inglis also came under the scanner, particularly because of his limited availability for the season.""If you look at the batting order for LSG, they're very similar to SRH. Buying Josh, even if he was available for the full season at that price, doesn't make sense because he's not going to be in the starting line-up,"" concluded former India opener Abhinav Mukund.","Lucknow Super Giants have bolstered their bowling resources at the mini-auction.

Why Rohit Sharma got really emotional at a promotional event

Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif unleashed sharp criticism against the Ajit Agarkar-headed selection committee, slamming their inadequate strategy ahead of the T20 World Cup 2026. On his YouTube channel, Kaif tore into the committee's approach to Shubman Gill.“They knew there were better players, I am talking about the T20 format. Just this one. There were better players than Gill. So it was the mistake of the selectors. They have made a mistake and Indian cricket has gone behind. For two to three months, you could have invested in Jaiswal, Samson, and Jitesh,” he said.Kaif stressed how those lost months alongside Suryakumar could have built Axar's readiness for bigger responsibilities before the World Cup.“It is a loss for Axar Patel who returns as vice-captain and for the Indian team as well. The squad is still solid and there is no doubt. But if Axar had continued as vice-captain, he would have been a part of this team meeting, and he would have gotten time to work on his leadership.""Let’s assume Surya gets injured, then if Axar had had those two to three months as vice-captain, he would know more about his team and the players.If he has to captain, he would have been better prepared, so that opportunity was taken away from him,” remarked Kaif.Kaif acknowledged dropping Gill was correct in the end, but lambasted the timing as evidence of ""zero planning."" Sticking with an unproven player in 17-18 fruitless outings wasted precious preparation and sidelined ready alternatives.“You carried Gill till the very end and then dropped him. I feel it is the right call. It came late, but it was right. The planning is zero. There is no planning. It has been a waste of time in the name of planning.

This has happened very rarely.""There was no option left as he did not score in 17-18 innings, and how many more chances would you give him? The pressure was increasing. No one wanted to drop him, but I feel it has been a waste of time for Indian cricket and those players who should have gotten the opportunity.”","Mohammad Kaif slams India's selection committee.

England XI for Boxing Day Ashes Test:

England have made some changes to their playing XI for the fourth Ashes Test against Australia. In this year's Boxing Day Test, England will take on Australia in Melbourne on Friday.The biggest setback is the loss of fast bowler Jofra Archer, who has been ruled out of the rest of the series due to a side strain.This is another tough blow for England on a tour where nothing has gone their way so far.Archer, 30, had only recently returned to Test cricket after being away for four years because of elbow and back injuries.He picked up the side injury during the third Test in Adelaide and will now miss both the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne and the final Test in Sydney.According to the reports, he will return to the UK after the fourth Test for further checks, and a decision will then be made about his availability for the T20 World Cup early next year.Despite England being 3-0 down, Archer has been one of their few bright spots. He took nine wickets in the series and also scored his first Test half-century in Adelaide.Captain Ben Stokes praised his effort, saying, ""The effort that he's put in over these three games has been exceptional.""He added, ""There were a lot of question marks around his ability or whatever it may be coming out to Australia, and he's put in a great effort for the team.""With Archer out, Gus Atkinson comes into the XI. England are already without Mark Wood, who is also injured, but they do not plan to add another fast bowler to the squad.There is also a major change in the batting line-up. Ollie Pope has been dropped after a poor run of form and replaced by Jacob Bethell.Pope has struggled throughout the series, with a highest score of just 46. His average over the past seven Tests is low, and this is the first time he has been left out of a Test side since 2022.Bethell, 22, has shown promise but has not played much first-class cricket this year. However, he did score 71 for England Lions against Australia A earlier this month, which helped his case.Stokes admitted the mood in the camp is low, saying, ""He's not going to be the only one who's disappointed in the dressing room with how things have gone... There's going to be a lot of disappointment within the dressing room from everyone who's in there.""Ben Duckett keeps his place despite an off-field controversy, with Stokes offering strong support.England now head into the fourth Test hoping these changes can spark a turnaround in a tough Ashes campaign.Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Jacob Bethell, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (capt), Jamie Smith, Will Jacks, Gus Atkinson, Brydon Carse, Josh Tongue.",England have made some changes to their playing XI for the fourth Ashes Test against Australia.

T20 World Cup squad: Are India going Pakistan's chaotic way?

Wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan is making a strong case for inclusion in India’s squad for the upcoming New Zealand ODI series after smashing a 33-ball century for Jharkhand against Karnataka in the Vijay Hazare Trophy in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.Kishan’s whirlwind knock is the second-fastest century by an Indian in List A cricket, just one delivery shy of Bihar captain Sakibul Gani’s record 32-ball ton against Arunachal Pradesh, also achieved earlier on the same day.The 27-year-old was recently recalled to the Indian squad for the T20 World Cup, following a stellar performance in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, where he amassed 517 runs and played a match-winning century in the final to guide Jharkhand to their maiden title.Against Karnataka, Kishan scored 125 off just 39 balls, hitting seven fours and 14 sixes at a staggering strike rate of 320.51.Jharkhand had a shaky start after Karnataka won the toss and chose to field. Openers Utkarsh Singh and Shubh Sharma fell cheaply for eight and 15, respectively. Shikhar Mohan contributed 44 before being dismissed in the 24th over.A 129-run fourth-wicket partnership between Virat Singh (88 off 68 balls) and Kumar Kushagra (63) steadied the innings. Kishan then unleashed his explosive century to propel Jharkhand to a massive 412-9 in 50 overs.","Kishan scored 125 off just 39 balls, hitting seven fours and 14 sixes at a staggering strike rate of 320.51.

Barely four minutes had elapsed when Grace opened the scoring, capitalising on a swift move down the right flank.

Sreebhumi resumed with renewed intensity and doubled their advantage in the 59th minute. Haldar slipped a precise through ball into the penalty area, and Grace timed her run perfectly to guide the ball home.Gokulam's resistance faded further seven minutes later when Rimpa Haldar added a third.Picking up possession at the edge of the box, she showed composure to round goalkeeper Sowmiya N before rolling the ball into an empty net.The rout was completed in the 77th minute. A cross from the left caused chaos inside the Gokulam box, with Sowmiya initially saving Sibani Devi's effort and Anju Tamang clearing off the line.

Poll Do you think Aston Villa can win the Premier League this season? Yes, they have a strong chance No, they will fall short Not sure yet They need to improve further

Aston Villa continued their stunning Premier League title charge on Sunday as Morgan Rogers’ brilliant brace sealed a 2-1 victory over Manchester United at a raucous Villa Park, extending Unai Emery’s side’s extraordinary winning run.Rogers put Villa ahead late in the first half with a moment of individual brilliance before restoring the lead after the break, his goals securing a 10th consecutive victory in all competitions and keeping the Midlands club firmly in the title conversation.Third-placed Villa now sit just three points behind leaders Arsenal and one adrift of Manchester City, chasing what would be their first English league title since 1981. Their current run is their best in all competitions since 1914, while seven straight top-flight wins marks their strongest league streak since the 1989-90 season.Villa’s rise has been remarkable given their dismal start to the campaign, when they collected just two points and scored a single goal from their opening five matches — their worst beginning for 28 years. Under Emery, however, Villa Park has become a fortress, with only one Premier League home defeat in 2025, fewer than any other side.Even Manchester United, who had lost just once in their previous 26 visits to Villa, could not halt Emery’s momentum. United briefly responded after Villa’s opener, Matheus Cunha finishing clinically after Matty Cash gifted possession on the stroke of half-time.But the loss of captain Bruno Fernandes to an apparent hamstring injury at the interval proved decisive. Already depleted by injuries, suspension and Africa Cup of Nations absences, Ruben Amorim’s side lacked control after the break.Villa regained the lead in the 57th minute when Rogers showed greater hunger than Leny Yoro, pouncing on a loose ball in the box and finishing confidently for his sixth goal in as many league appearances. Emery celebrated wildly on the touchline, tossing his jacket skywards as Villa closed in on another statement win.United had chances to respond, with Emiliano Martinez producing key saves and Cunha wasting a gilt-edged header, but Villa held firm. Amorim handed a debut to teenager Jack Fletcher late on, yet the evening belonged to the hosts.",Aston Villa beat Manchester United 2-1 at Villa Park on Sunday.

Fans throw objects, vandalise stadium after Messi leaves early | Hyderabad next

NEW DELHI: Former India football captain Bhaichung Bhutia has strongly criticised the chaos that took place during Lionel Messi ’s public event at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata.Speaking on Sunday, Bhutia called the incident unfortunate and said sports events should always be treated with importance, without unnecessary delays caused by politics or formalities.He said fans come to stadiums to enjoy the sport and watch their favourite players, not to sit through long speeches or wait for VIPs to arrive.“I think when there is a sports event, sports should get priority,” he said.He also pointed out that this problem is seen often across India. According to Bhutia, many sporting events are delayed because organisers wait for politicians or chief guests. He said such practices only harm the experience for fans and players.“Many times across India, we see sporting events getting delayed because of political speeches, chief guest handshakes and all that. That is not necessary. Fans and players are coming to watch the sport, and the sport should begin rather than waiting for VIPs.”Talking about Lionel Messi’s recent G.O.A.T. Tour of India, Bhutia said the response from fans clearly showed what people really want. He said fans in Kolkata and other cities only wanted to see Messi and enjoy the sport, without any extra drama.“It was good to see not just in Kolkata, but across different cities, fans just wanted to see the sporting event, who just wanted to see Messi and nothing else.”Bhutia hopes that what happened in Kolkata will act as a wake-up call for organisers and authorities in the future.“I hope this is a lesson we will learn and that this trend will change,” he added.The promotional event featuring Lionel Messi turned chaotic due to poor planning and crowd control.Thousands of fans were disappointed as politicians, celebrities and officials surrounded Messi, limiting his interaction with the public.His time on the field was also cut short. Frustrated by the situation, some spectators created disturbances inside the stadium.","Bhaichung Bhutia has strongly criticised the chaos that took place during Lionel Messi’s public event at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata.

Lionel Messi India tour: Inside story of what went wrong in Kolkata

NEW DELHI: Satadru Dutta, the main organiser of Lionel Messi’s event held on December 13 and now under arrest, has told investigators that the footballer was unhappy with physical contact during his appearance at the Salt Lake Stadium and left the venue before completing the scheduled programme, news agency PTI reported on Saturday, quoting a source in the Special Investigation Team (SIT).During questioning, Dutta told SIT officers that Messi ""did not like being touched on the back or being hugged"" and that this concern had been communicated in advance by foreign security officials assigned to protect the footballer, the source said.""Despite repeated public announcements to restrain the crowd, there was no impact. The manner in which Messi was surrounded and embraced was completely unacceptable to the World Cup-winning footballer,"" Dutta told investigators during his grilling on Friday, the source added, as cited by the PTI.West Bengal sports minister Aroop Biswas was seen close to Messi during the programme, with visuals showing him holding the footballer around the waist while posing for photographs. Biswas has been accused of using his influence to allow relatives and personal acquaintances access to Messi. Amid criticism, he resigned from his post as sports minister pending completion of the investigation.Investigators are examining how a large number of people were allowed to access the ground area.Dutta claimed that initially only 150 ground passes were issued, but the number was tripled after a ""very influential person"" arrived at the stadium and ""overpowered him"". Police are checking whether the increase in access led to the crowd control failure.""The arrested accused also claimed that once that particular influential person reached the stadium, all the flow-chart for the Messi programme got disturbed and he could not control it,"" the official told PTI.Dutta also shared financial details related to Messi’s India visit. ""Lionel Messi was paid Rs 89 crore for the tour, while Rs 11 crore was paid as tax to the Indian government,"" he told investigators, putting the total cost at Rs 100 crore. Sources said 30 per cent of the amount came from sponsors and another 30 per cent from ticket sales.SIT officers also found more than Rs 20 crore in Dutta’s frozen bank accounts. On Friday, they seized several documents during raids at his residence.""Dutta claimed that the amount in his bank account was the money which he got from selling the tickets for the Messi event in Kolkata and Hyderabad and also from the sponsors. We are verifying his claims,"" the officer said.What was supposed to be a marquee football spectacle turned into widespread violence and disorder at the stadium last week after Messi’s brief and tightly ring-fenced appearance, his first at the venue since 2011, left large sections of the crowd frustrated.They failed to catch a glimpse of their superstar despite having travelled from far and wide, paying hefty sums for tickets.The West Bengal government has formed an SIT comprising senior IPS officers Piyush Pandey, Javed Shamim, Supratim Sarkar and Muralidhar to investigate the vandalism, security lapses, access violations and the role of organisers and officials in the incident, the officer added.","Satadru Dutta, the main organiser of Lionel Messi’s event held on December 13 and now under arrest, has told investigators that the footballer was unhappy with physical contact.

A trophy with a meaning

The hollow in a million hearts

A new trophy, a new start

A forgotten memory

NEW DELHI: Looking back today, it feels almost unreal that the original FIFA World Cup trophy no longer exists.In an era where constant digital tracking and tight security were absent, football lost one of its most treasured symbols quietly and permanently. The Jules Rimet Trophy, which crowned the world champions of football for four decades, was stolen in 1983 and never recovered.The Jules Rimet Trophy was the first official World Cup prize. It was awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup from 1930 to 1970. Named after Jules Rimet, the former FIFA president who played a key role in starting the World Cup, the trophy carried enormous historical value.It was made of solid gold and featured a sculpted figure holding a cup, making it instantly recognisable to fans across the world.For Brazil, the trophy had special meaning.The country first won the World Cup in 1958 and defended the title in 1962. Brazil won the tournament in 1970 for the third time, completing a remarkable journey.At the time, it was under FIFA rules that any country that won the World Cup three times was allowed to keep the Jules Rimet Trophy permanently.Led by football legend Pelé, Brazil’s victory in 1970 gave the nation permanent ownership of the trophy.After the celebrations ended, the Jules Rimet Trophy was placed at the headquarters of the Brazilian Football Confederation in Rio de Janeiro.It was displayed in a glass case and treated as a symbol of Brazil’s football greatness. Security arrangements were modest, reflecting a time when the idea of stealing such an object seemed unlikely.That sense of safety did not last.In December 1983, the Jules Rimet Trophy was stolen. It all happened under the night skies when thieves broke into the CBF building. They damaged the display case and took the trophy.When officials arrived later, they found that the most famous prize in football history was gone.News of the theft reached the ears of the general public soon across Brazil and beyond. In a country where football makes people fanatics, the loss was deeply felt.The trophy was not only the representation of their success on the pitch, but it also stood for generations of players and moments that shaped the sport.Brazilian police launched an investigation immediately. Over time, several suspects were arrested, including a jeweller. Investigators worked to trace the trophy and understand the motive behind the theft. Their findings pointed to a simple but devastating conclusion. The Jules Rimet Trophy was made of solid gold, and gold could be melted.According to the investigation, the trophy was melted down and sold as gold. This conclusion was based on police evidence and statements from those involved.Once melted, the trophy lost its identity completely. No markings, shapes or features remained. Not a single piece of the original Jules Rimet Trophy has ever been recovered.This was not the first time the trophy had been stolen. In 1966, ahead of the World Cup in England, the Jules Rimet Trophy disappeared from an exhibition in London.In an interesting end to the saga, the trophy was found wrapped in newspaper under a hedge by a dog named Pickles.It was soon returned safely, and the incident became part of football folklore.The 1983 theft in Brazil had no such ending.With no hope of recovery, Brazil later commissioned a replica of the Jules Rimet Trophy. The replica was placed on display to preserve the memory of Brazil’s achievement.However, it could not replace the historical value of the original trophy that had been lifted by champions from 1930 onwards.The disappearance of the Jules Rimet Trophy also influenced how football treated its prizes.After Brazil’s third World Cup win, FIFA introduced a new trophy, first awarded in 1974. The current FIFA World Cup Trophy is not permanently awarded to any nation. Winners lift the original trophy during celebrations but are later given a replica to keep. The original remains under FIFA’s control.The loss of the Jules Rimet Trophy forced FIFA to look at this rule with a strict eye.For Brazil, the theft was especially painful.The 1970 team is widely considered one of the greatest sides in football history. Players like Pelé, Jairzinho, Rivelino and others created moments that will forever be in the memories of the fans.The trophy they earned through skill and success on the field was lost through negligence and crime.The story continues to be remembered even after decades.Authorities believe they know what happened to the trophy. Yet, the sense of loss remains because the outcome cannot be reversed.Football history was erased in physical form.Today, fans can only see photographs and replicas of the Jules Rimet Trophy. Museums display its likeness, and books recount its journey. But the original, which once travelled across continents and crowned the first world champions, no longer exists.The stolen World Cup trophy stands as a reminder of a different era. It shows how even the most valuable symbols can be lost if they are not protected. It also highlights how fragile history can be.Football has moved forward since then. New trophies have been lifted, new legends have emerged, and new memories have been created. Yet the story of the Jules Rimet Trophy remains one of the sport’s most sobering chapters.It is a throwback to a time when the World Cup could disappear. And never return.","The Jules Rimet Trophy was the first official World Cup prize. It was awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup from 1930 to 1970. For Brazil, the trophy had special meaning. The country first won the World Cup in 1958 and defended the title in 1962. Brazil won the tournament in 1970 for the third time, completing a remarkable journey.

At least 59 people, including seven police officers, were injured after violent clashes erupted between rival football supporters following Colombia’s Copa Colombia final in Medellin on Wednesday night, authorities said, in scenes that overshadowed Atletico Nacional’s title triumph.The unrest broke out moments after the final whistle at the Atanasio Girardot Stadium, where Atletico Nacional edged past city rivals Deportivo Independiente Medellin 1-0 to lift the trophy. What should have been a night of celebration quickly descended into chaos as fans from both sides stormed the pitch, hurled projectiles and clashed with security forces.Videos of the violence circulated widely on social media, showing dozens of supporters invading the field and confrontations breaking out in different sections of the stadium. Riot police were forced to intervene to restore order as the situation spiralled out of control in front of a crowd of around 43,000 spectators.Medellin’s security secretary Manuel Villa confirmed that 52 fans were treated for injuries sustained during the clashes, while police said seven officers were also hurt. No arrests were reported, but Villa said authorities were reviewing CCTV footage from inside and around the stadium to identify those responsible.The violence had immediate consequences for the event, with officials cancelling the post-match trophy presentation and medal ceremony for Atletico Nacional players due to safety concerns.In Colombia, visiting fans are typically barred from attending high-risk fixtures to prevent crowd trouble. However, Medellin city hall had allowed Atletico Nacional supporters — officially designated as the visiting side — to attend the final as part of an initiative to promote peaceful coexistence in football.Medellin mayor Federico Gutierrez strongly condemned the incidents, describing those involved as “criminals” and “misfits” who do not represent the sport.","At least 59 people, including seven police officers, were injured after violent clashes erupted following Colombia’s Copa Colombia final.

PARIS: Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Matvey Safonov has been left with a fractured hand following his penalty shootout heroics to win the Intercontinental Cup.Safonov made four straight penalty saves as PSG beat Brazil's Flamengo 2-1 in the shootout on Wednesday to secure the club's first global title. He was thrown in the air by his teammates during the celebrations.PSG said Friday that Safonov has a fracture in his left hand and that “his situation will be re-evaluated” after three or four weeks.“I can’t explain anything, it’s incredible. The player doesn’t know how it happened,” coach Luis Enrique said in translated comments Friday.He added that the most plausible explanation seemed to be that Safonov was hurt during the shootout and kept playing with the fracture.In a video posted on social media app Telegram, Safonov didn't address what happened directly, but said: “You know, no matter what happens, I can't be broken.”Safonov, PSG’s Russian backup goalkeeper, hadn’t played a single minute for the team until summer signing Lucas Chevalier sustained an ankle injury which has ruled him out since his last game Nov. 29.Chevalier was on the bench against Flamengo.

Gracie Hunt’s over-the-top festive fashion draws criticism amid mounting backlash surrounding Chiefs’ $3B stadium agreement



Clark Hunt and the Kansas City Chiefs stadium deal sit at the center of a growing debate that now stretches beyond football and into public trust.Clark Hunt leads a family that often speaks about family, faith, and football, values deeply woven into the Kansas City Chiefs identity. That message usually lands well with fans, especially given the franchise’s rich history passed down from AFL pioneer Lamar Hunt. But when enormous wealth intersects with public money, perception shifts quickly. The Hunts control a football empire valued at roughly $25 billion, and that reality framed every reaction once the new stadium agreement became public.The timing only sharpened the reaction. As Kansas City exited playoff contention earlier than expected, attention drifted off the field. On Christmas Eve, that spotlight landed on Gracie Hunt, Clark’s eldest child, who shared a festive Chiefs-red look while celebrating the season and her faith. The post might have felt routine in another moment. Instead, it landed during a week when many fans and taxpayers still struggled to digest the scale of the deal.The agreement calls for $1.8 billion in public funding toward a $3 billion project, even after Missouri voters rejected taxpayer money to renovate Arrowhead Stadium, one of the league’s most iconic venues.The Chiefs will now move from Missouri to Kansas, leaving behind a stadium that has defined generations of football since 1972. For many locals, the shift felt abrupt and deeply personal.Against that backdrop, Gracie Hunt’s holiday post struck a nerve. Her Dolce & Gabbana outfit, prominently branded and unmistakably expensive, became a symbol for critics who felt the family misread the moment. The message of faith resonated, but the luxury display overshadowed it. Sports business analyst Joe Pompliano labeled the arrangement ""the most lopsided deal in NFL history."" That phrase spread quickly, amplifying frustration among fans who see public dollars carrying private gain.This backlash is not about one outfit or one social post. It reflects a wider discomfort with how power and money operate in modern sports. Fans understand that NFL ownership brings privilege. What unsettles them is when that privilege appears disconnected from community sacrifice.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes steals the spotlight by twinning with her kids in heartwarming Christmas pajama photos","Gracie Hunt, the eldest child of Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, wore a Chiefs-red outfit on Christmas Eve.

Brittany Mahomes embraces family time as Patrick begins a new chapter

Brittany Mahomes knows how quickly life can shift in the NFL. One week is packed stadium lights and roaring crowds, the next is quiet mornings and recovery plans. This Christmas Eve, she chose warmth over spectacle, leaning into calm moments at home with her children while the season around her felt anything but calm.Brittany Mahomes opened a rare, intimate window into her family’s holiday rhythm, sharing a peaceful snapshot that stood in contrast to the challenges swirling around the Kansas City Chiefs. The image carried no noise, no pressure, just togetherness. It felt intentional, like a pause button pressed at the right moment, as her family navigates both celebration and setback during an emotional stretch of the season.The photo Brittany shared showed her curled up on the couch with Sterling and baby Golden, all dressed in matching plaid Christmas pajamas. Soft colors filled the frame. The scene spoke quietly but clearly. This was about comfort and connection. She followed it with a glimpse of their holiday decor, including a towering silver nutcracker and a tree dressed in cream tones. The absence of Patrick and Bronze in the frame did not feel loud.It felt real.That calm arrived days after Patrick Mahomes suffered a season-ending ACL injury against the Chargers. His words afterward revealed both pain and resolve. “Don’t know why this had to happen,” he wrote. “And not going to lie it’s hurts. But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again.” He continued with gratitude, adding, “Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I Will be back stronger than ever. ”Even sidelined, Patrick stayed present. He surprised his offensive line with luxury Christmas gifts, drawing praise from the team and fans alike. The Chiefs acknowledged the gesture with a caption that reflected the locker room spirit: “Christmas came early for the o-line! Shoutout to QB1 for the gifts.”While the team prepares for a Christmas Day game without their star quarterback, Brittany has carried her own momentum forward. Known all season for bold and thoughtful game-day fashion, she shifted seamlessly into strength and routine at home. On Christmas Eve, she shared a workout moment with Sterling and Bronze, writing, “Christmas Eve workout with my kiddos ❤️.”Recovery will take time. Patrick’s return is targeted for the start of the 2026 season. Until then, the Mahomes family is leaning on faith, movement, and small moments that matter most.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour rehearsal goes off-script after Chiefs touchdown sends her into celebration mode in Disney+ docuseries The End of an Era","Brittany Mahomes shared a photo of her and her kids in matching pajamas.

Why Aaron Rodgers is pushing back against speculation about Brittani’s identity

Aaron Rodgers sounds off on living life in the public eye #PMSLive

For most of his NFL career, Aaron Rodgers ’ personal life unfolded alongside his professional one, often under an unforgiving spotlight. From high-profile relationships to public breakups, the quarterback rarely escaped speculation. That changed after his move to the Pittsburgh Steelers, when Rodgers quietly confirmed he was married to a woman named Brittani.Instead of curiosity fading, the revelation sparked even louder questions, with fans dissecting clues and online theories attempting to identify his wife. Rodgers, however, has made it clear that this chapter of his life is intentionally different. What he’s asking for now isn’t attention or approval, but something he says has been missing for years: privacy.Following Rodgers’ admission that he’s married, some fans began linking his wife to former America’s Next Top Model winner Brittani Kline. The theory gained traction because of the shared first name and Kline’s past visibility, but the facts quickly fell apart. Kline has publicly shared details of her own life, including motherhood, a long-term partner, and a lifestyle far removed from Rodgers’. More importantly, Rodgers himself has explained why such speculation misses the point entirely.Appearing on The Pat McAfee Show, the Steelers quarterback addressed why he’s protective of his wife and openly frustrated with the public’s reaction. “It’s a sick society … I lived in the public eye for 20 years,” Rodgers said. “I had public relationships. How did that work out?” He recalled invasive moments from his past, including people leaking personal information and calling paparazzi without consent.Rodgers contrasted those experiences with his current relationship, explaining, “Now I’m with somebody who’s private, who doesn’t want to be in the public eye, didn’t sign up to be a celebrity, doesn’t want to be a part of it.” For him, choosing privacy isn’t secrecy, it’s self-preservation. “And because I do things in private because I want my personal life to be private, now I’m weird,” he added.As Rodgers settles into a new phase of his career and life, his message is consistent: not every relationship connected to a famous athlete exists for public consumption. For once, he’s choosing boundaries over headlines and asking fans to respect the difference.Also Read: “I have the most incredible wife”: Aaron Rodgers’ heartfelt words about his wife deepen the mystery around his private life",Aaron Rodgers has confirmed he is married to a woman named Brittani.

The moment sparked online debate about public versus private expressions of love, highlighting how even sincere celebrity moments are closely scrutinized by fans.

Travis Kelce’s emotional letter to Taylor Swift sparks mixed fan reactions

A tender moment from Taylor Swift ’s The End of an Era docuseries has reignited conversation around her relationship with Travis Kelce , but not everyone is reacting the same way. In the series, Swift reads part of a handwritten letter Kelce wrote before the final three shows of her historic 2025 Eras Tour.For many viewers, it felt like an intimate glimpse into a relationship built on admiration and emotional support. For others, the moment raised questions about intention, timing, and how public romance is interpreted in the age of constant cameras. The reaction highlights a familiar reality for celebrity couples: even sincere gestures are rarely received without debate.Kelce’s note, written ahead of Swift’s final tour dates, reflected his early awe of her long before their relationship became public. “So many unbelievable memories on this tour but my favorite one is seeing you in concert for the first time and being mesmerized and swept off my feet by a woman who doesn’t even know me,” he wrote.Swift later finished reading the letter privately, reacting with a laugh and telling her mother, “Aww my God! So much for no emotions on the last three shows.”While many fans viewed the moment as deeply romantic, others dissected Swift’s reaction just as closely as the words themselves.One Reddit user admitted, “So, I clearly underestimated just how much of a romantic Travis was. Him writing that letter to her I dunno that was just super cute.”Another commenter felt differently, saying, “I just think it was funny how taylor was emotional with her family and bandmates but reading that letter didn’t get her emotional at all.”Some skepticism also centered on visibility. “im going to sound like a cynic but doing something specifically knowing its going to be shown on camera its kinda :/,” one fan wrote. Others pushed back, pointing out Kelce’s long-standing habit of celebrating loudly and publicly. “He created a whole ‘end of an era’ party… I think Travis just loves very loudly,” another fan commented.Ultimately, the moment says less about the couple’s authenticity and more about how audiences project expectations onto highly visible relationships. For Swift and Kelce, engaged since August 2025, it was simply another chapter in a romance unfolding under an unblinking spotlight.Also Read: Taylor Swift reflects on a heartbreaking cancer diagnosis during the Eras Tour and how Travis Kelce became her source of happiness","Travis Kelce’s emotional letter to Taylor Swift sparks mixed fan reactions.

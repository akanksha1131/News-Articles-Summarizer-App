New Delhi:

India’s Sujeet Kalkal became only the fourth Indian to ever claim a gold medal at the U23 World Wrestling Championships after defeating Uzbekistan’s Umidjon Jalolov by technical superiority in the men’s 65kg final in Serbia’s Novi Sad on Monday.Kalkal, a former U20 and U23 Asian champion, showed sharp tactical skills, defensive acumen, confident foot movement and precise counter-attacking moves to defeat the Uzbek wrestler by 10-0 and cap off country’s campaign in the event on a high.India finished with a total of nine medals at the age-group Worlds – with the nation’s women wrestlers securing an impressive seven-medal haul, including two silver won by Hansika Lamba (53kg) and Sarika Malik (59kg).In the men’s categories, Indian wrestlers claimed a medal each, with Maharashtra’s Vishvajit More settling for bronze in the greco-roman 55kg division.Kalkal, a former U20 world championships bronze medallist, conjured up some stunning wins throughout the competition to win the solitary goal for India. In the quarters, Kalkal defeated two-time U23 world champion Bashir Magomedov of UWW 4-2 and, in his last-four stage clash on Sunday evening, he recorded one of the biggest upsets of the tournament after scripting a thrilling, come-from-behind 3-2 victory over two-time U20 world champion Yuto Nishiuchi of Japan.Kalkal had pulled off an amazing two-point throw in the dying moments of his semis – three seconds from the hooter to be precise – to overpower Nishiuchi and secure his place in the 65kg title clash.At the previous edition of the U23 Worlds, Kalkal had won bronze in the same weight division. Prior to claiming his maiden U23 world title, Kalkal had two U23 Asian titles (2022, 2025) and one U20 Asian Championship gold (2022).Kalkal’s triumph also meant that he joined the elite list of Indian wrestlers with top podium finishes at the age-group Worlds. Chirag Chikkara won gold in the men’s 57kg in Tirana last year. Paris Olympics medallist Aman Sehrawat (men’s 57kg) in 2022 and Reetika Hooda (women’s 76kg) last year are the other two gold winners.",Sujeet Kalkal became only the fourth Indian to ever claim a gold medal at the U23 World Wrestling Championships.

Atul Wassan criticises Congress leader Shama Mohamed for comments on Sarfaraz Khan

NEW DELHI: Sarfaraz Khan , a consistent performer in domestic red-ball cricket, endured a disappointing outing in Mumbai’s recent Ranji Trophy match against Chhattisgarh, managing just one run. The 26-year-old middle-order batter, widely backed by fans and pundits for national selection, had recently been overlooked for the India A squad against South Africa A, prompting surprise and debate.On a seamer-friendly Bandra-Kurla Complex pitch, Sarfaraz was dismissed by Chhattisgarh’s left-arm spinner Aditya Sarwate after facing only six deliveries.After the dismissal, Sarfaraz shared an Instagram Stories post showing his TV screen playing the song Restart from the movie 12th Fail, with his India Test cap and Mumbai cap visible behind the television.This came after a relatively better performance in his previous Ranji outing against Jammu & Kashmir in Srinagar, where he scored 42 and 32, marking a return from injury.Mumbai captain Shardul Thakur defended Khan’s international prospects despite his India A omission.“Nowadays, for the India A side they look at boys, who they want to prepare for international cricket. Sarfaraz doesn’t need India A games to play international cricket. If he gets back to scoring again, he can straightaway go and play Test series too,” he said.“He is coming from an injury lay-off. But before that, he scored two or three centuries in the Buchi Babu Trophy.Coming back against J&K, he had a nice 40 (42). It was very unfortunate to have been run out. But for him, I don’t think playing India A is important. He is a senior pro and whenever we put him in there in the 22 yards, he is someone who always delivers in crunch situations,” Thakur added.Thakur also praised Sarfaraz's ability under pressure: “He has big scores of 200-250s and those innings have come when the team was two or three down quite early. To play that kind of innings under pressure, you have to have something special. He is one of the special players who never disappoints. Regardless of which number he bats, I think he will deliver.”","Sarfaraz Khan endured a disappointing outing in Mumbai’s recent Ranji Trophy match against Chhattisgarh, managing just one run.

Two Australian Women Cricketers Stalked and Molested in Indore; Police Arrest Accused Amid Outrage

NEW DELHI: Aqeel Khan has been arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting two members of the Australian women’s cricket team while they were walking from their hotel to a café in Indore. Initially, he told police that he only wanted to take a selfie with the players. However, he later admitted to following and molesting them after spotting them on his way back home.Investigations revealed that the 30-year-old had gone to Sathya Sai Square in the morning to drop off his father. While returning, he saw the players walking from Robot Square toward Khajrana. Aqeel first passed them, then took a U-turn, approached them again, and allegedly molested them before fleeing on a motorcycle without a registration number.MIG police tracked him down using technical surveillance and intelligence inputs and arrested him.“Initially, he maintained that he only wanted a selfie, but later admitted to following and molesting the players,” said additional DCP Rajesh Dandotiya. Aqeel was produced in court on Sunday and remanded in judicial custody for 15 days.The shocking incident occurred just two days before Australia’s top-of-the-table clash against South Africa in the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup and has raised concerns about India’s reputation as a safe sporting destination, especially ahead of the 2030 Commonwealth Games.In a statement, Cricket Australia confirmed the incident, saying, “CA can confirm two members of the Australian Women’s team were approached and touched inappropriately by a motorcyclist while walking to a cafe in Indore. The matter was reported by team security to police who are handling the matter.”","Aqeel Khan has been arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting two members of the Australian women’s cricket team while they were walking from their hotel to a café in Indore.

India vs Australia: Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma rewrite history at SCG

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma ’s arrival at the crease during the third and final ODI at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday was met with a mix of awe, nostalgia, and emotion. It wasn’t just Indian fans who were captivated — even the Australian crowd and commentators were moved by what could be the legendary duo’s final outing together on Australian soil.“Standby, because while the skipper is departing, the king is about to arrive for the very last time on Australian shores in Indian colours. Ladies and gentlemen… here he is, Virat Kohli,” said Adam White on SEN Cricket.“As you'd expect, as we always see, he marches out with purpose. Arguably the best one-day record in the history of the game.”Trent Copeland added, “You got to pinch yourself occasionally, don't you Whitey? That we're here for this moment. This guy has been at the centre of seismic shifts in cricket. Unquestionably the best one-day record.”Rohit Sharma (121 not out) continued his fine form from Adelaide, producing an even more flawless knock to register his 33rd ODI hundred. The former India skipper now sits third on the list of most centuries in the format, behind Kohli (51) and Sachin Tendulkar (49).Kohli, after back-to-back ducks in the first two ODIs, bounced back with an unbeaten 74. As the two walked back to the pavilion following India’s nine-wicket victory, the SCG crowd erupted in applause — and an emotional Australian commentator was even seen in tears. The video quickly went viral on social media.Kohli’s knock also helped him surpass Kumar Sangakkara to become the second-highest run-scorer in men’s ODI history, with 14,255 runs in 305 matches — trailing only Sachin Tendulkar.","Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma’s arrival at the crease during the third and final ODI at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday was met with a mix of awe, nostalgia, and emotion.

Bengaluru:

Former India medium-fast bowler Venkatesh Prasad has criticised the delay in holding elections to the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA), which were initially scheduled for September 30.Nearly a month has passed since that date, yet there has been no official announcement regarding the elections, with KSCA officials declining to comment on the matter.Prasad questioned the prolonged silence from “people running the show” and called for transparency and accountability in Karnataka cricket administration.Speaking at a media gathering here on Monday, Prasad did not mince his words, saying: “According to the rule, elections should’ve happened on September 30, but we still have no clue about when they’re going to be conducted. Since there are hardly any office-bearers left, it’s high time the people running the show announce the election dates.”He further said: “KSCA, in its letter dated June 24, said they would be conducting the elections by September 30. Then why have they not adhered to it?”Barring the joint secretary, KSCA currently has no office-bearers.While Raghuram Bhat, who was the president, was elected BCCI treasurer last month, vice-president K. Sriram resigned earlier this month.Secretary A. Shankar and A. E. Jairam, the treasurer, resigned on June 7, citing moral responsibility for the stampede at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in June, in which 11 people lost their lives.Prasad, a former KSCA vice-president, also lamented the deteriorating condition of Chinnaswamy Stadium.He added: “Looking at the chaos inside and outside, people are laughing at us. The best example is that (Women’s) World Cup matches have been taken out of here.”Prasad’s words found an echo in former KSCA treasurer Vinay Mruthyunjaya and former India captain Shantha Rangaswamy, who also rued the current state of affairs at KSCA.Prasad further said: “I am given to understand that the managing committee is trying to misinterpret the bylaws to disqualify a few able administrators, citing the nine-year rule. But that didn’t apply to many, including former presidents Roger Binny and Raghuram Bhat.”","Venkatesh Prasad has criticised the delay in holding elections to the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) The elections were initially scheduled for September 30.

Rain threat looms over Women’s World Cup knockouts: Here’s how ICC’s reserve day rule works,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-womens-world-cup-2025/rain-threat-looms-over-womens-world-cup-knockouts-heres-how-iccs-reserve-day-rule-works/articleshow/124852917.cms,"Ground staff covers the pitch as rain stops play during an ICC Women's World Cup 2025 (PTI Photo/Shashank Parade)



So how do these reserve days actually work?



But what if rain plays spoilsport on both days?

The ICC Women’s ODI World Cup 2025 has entered its most nerve-racking stage — the knockouts. While teams are gearing up for the high-stakes semi-finals, there’s another challenge looming large: the weather.Both Guwahati and Navi Mumbai, the venues for the semi-finals, are under threat from rain-bearing clouds. With heavy showers predicted, fans and teams alike are wondering what happens if rain spoils the show.Fortunately, the ICC has made provisions to deal with such a scenario. The two semi-finals and the final each have a reserve day, ensuring the outcome of these crucial matches isn’t decided by the weather alone.According to ICC regulations, every possible effort will be made to complete the game on the scheduled day, even if it means reducing overs. If rain interrupts play, officials will aim to restart the match with a revised number of overs per side.If the match cannot resume or remains unfinished, it will continue from the exact point where it stopped on the reserve day.For example, if a full 50-over game begins but rain halts proceedings before any overs are reduced, it will continue as a 50-over contest the following day.However, if the match had already entered a shortened phase, say 46 overs per side, then it would pick up from that point on the reserve day.If no play is possible even after the reserve day, the team ranked higher on the points table from the group stage will progress. In that case, Australia and England — the top two teams from the league stage — would advance to the final if their respective semi-finals are washed out.And in the worst-case scenario where the final itself is abandoned across both days, the trophy will be shared between the two finalists.","The ICC Women’s ODI World Cup 2025 has entered its most nerve-racking stage — the knockouts.

Pratika Rawal Father Interview: On daughter's hundred, the World Cup dream and more

Shafali Verma has been named as Pratika Rawal’s replacement in India’s squad for the Women’s ODI World Cup 2025, just two days before their semi-final clash against Australia at the DY Patil Stadium. The 21-year-old opener, who was initially left out of the main and reserve squads, has been drafted in after Rawal was ruled out of the tournament with knee and ankle injuries sustained during India’s final league-stage match against Bangladesh.The injury occurred in the 21st over of Bangladesh’s innings when Rawal twisted her ankle while attempting to stop a boundary at deep mid-wicket. She immediately fell to the ground in pain and had to be helped off by the support staff. Scans later confirmed that the 25-year-old would not be fit in time for the rest of the World Cup.Rawal’s absence is a major blow to India’s campaign. She has been one of the team’s most consistent performers, scoring 308 runs in six innings at an average of 51.33, including a match-winning century against New Zealand and a vital 75 against Australia. Her opening partnership with Smriti Mandhana has been the backbone of India’s batting, the pair adding a record 212 runs against New Zealand earlier in the tournament.Shafali’s return, however, offers India a spark of aggression at the top. The young opener has been in superb domestic and franchise form, scoring 527 runs in the one-day format for Haryana at an average of 75.28 and striking 304 runs for Delhi Capitals in WPL 2025. Though she hasn’t played an ODI for India since October 2024, her recent performances for India A against Australia A and New Zealand A underline her readiness.With Rawal sidelined, India may also consider Amanjot Kaur or Harleen Deol to partner Mandhana if Shafali doesn’t feature immediately.

Mumbai: While veterans pulled Mumbai out of trouble on the first two days, the youngsters led the way on Day Three as Mumbai reduced Chhattisgarh to 176/6, still trailing by 241, in their Elite Group D Ranji Trophy match at the MCA Ground on Monday.The match was delayed by one and a half hours due to a wet outfield, and then Mumbai added just eight runs to their overnight total before their innings folded at 416.With the pitch not offering much assistance to the pacers, Chhattisgarh were given a steady start by their openers Ayush Pandey (50, 89b; 7x4) and Shashank Chandrakar (43, 112b; 5x4, 1x6), who put on 85 runs on the board.The duo looked comfortable in the post-lunch session as well before young spinner Himanshu Singh (2/33) and Musheer Khan (2/29) tilted the match in Mumbai's favour. Angkrish Raghuvanshi also did well in close-in fielding positions to take three good catches. With Shams Mulani also chipping in with two wickets, Chhattisgarh’s innings collapsed as they lost six wickets for just 82 runs.Chhattisgarh's slide was started by 22-year-old Himanshu, who was playing in place of Tanush Kotian, as he dismissed left-hander Pandey — well caught at silly point by Raghuvanshi.The off-spinner, who made his debut last season, bowled a tight line to rein in the Chhattisgarh batters, who at one point were scoring above five runs per over. He then had Chandrakar caught at leg-slip by Sarfaraz Khan Musheer took over from where Himanshu had left off, and with the pitch starting to grip and turn, he straightaway hit his stride, making the ball talk. The 20-year-old first trapped Sanjeet Desai (15, 33b; 1x4) in the last over before tea. The left-arm spinner then returned in the post-tea session to dismiss skipper Amandeep Khare, with Ajinkya Rahane taking a good low catch at first slip.While the young guns set the stage, the experienced Mulani came into his own in the last session, dismissing Ashutosh Singh (34, 56b; 3x4) and Ajay Mandal in back-to-back overs — both caught by Raghuvanshi at silly point and short leg. But as Mumbai were looking to go for the kill, rain interrupted the proceedings, and no further play was possible thereafter. Only 64 overs were bowled on the third day.Earlier, left-arm spinner Aditya Sarwate (5/103) dismissed Tushar Deshpande , one of the two Mumbai wickets to fall in the opening session, to take his 22nd five-wicket haul in first-class cricket.Wicketkeeper-batter Akash Anand, who made his debut last season, has been floated around in the batting order by Mumbai, but he has no issues with it, and his focus is solely on doing well for the team.The 30-year-old opens the batting for the Cricket Club of India in local matches and was at ease when he scored a century while opening in last season's Ranji Trophy semifinal against Vidarbha. His maiden ton came against Meghalaya during a group game while batting at No. 5. This season, he is batting down the order and came in at No. 8 to score a crucial 61 to take Mumbai's score past 400 against Chhattisgarh.""I was given a specific role and told that depending upon the composition of the team and the players who are available, my role would be changing. So I'm open to batting anywhere. I have opened in the past, and now if the situation demands, I'll open. Otherwise, this is the number at which I'll bat,"" Anand said on Monday.",Mumbai reduced Chhattisgarh to 176/6 on Day Three of their Ranji Trophy match.

SCOREBOARD

: The sun barely made an appearance here on Monday, but cloudy skies suited Karnataka ’s bowlers just fine as their four-pronged pace attack breathed fire in the first two sessions of play.However, try as they might, that attack couldn’t breach the defences of Arjun Tendulkar (43 batting) and Mohit Redkar (24 not out), who put on an unconquered 56-run partnership for the seventh wicket, a stand that halted Karnataka’s inexorable march towards the first-innings lead in this Ranji Trophy fixture.On another weather-curtailed day at the KSCA Navule Stadium here, Goa’s lower-order resistance took some sheen off Karnataka’s fine bowling. Responding to the home team’s first-innings score of 371, Goa reached 171/6 in 77 overs, still 200 runs in deficit and 50 shy of the follow-on when bad light ended play. An hour of play was lost in the morning due to a wet outfield, and only 64 overs were bowled on Day 3.Given Karnataka’s tryst with the weather in recent times, a win looks improbable. Three points from this outing look far more likely, but that may not be enough given Karnataka managed only a point in their opener and have sterner tests to come.The new-ball pair of Vidwath Kaverappa (2/30) and Abhilash Shetty (3/63) began sprightly enough, making optimum use of the conditions. They extracted movement off the surface and bowled to a plan and with purpose. The amalgamation of experience and youth worked well for the hosts as the duo bowled the day’s first 13 overs between them.Resuming from 28/1, Goa’s top order appeared positive in the face of that tough examination, but resistance quickly faded. Suyash Prabhudessai added a lone run to his overnight score of 11 before edging a full-length delivery from Kaverappa to wicketkeeper KL Shrijith. Most of Goa’s top and middle-order batters were done in by the rising ball, with skipper Snehal Kauthankar being no exception. He nicked Abhilash to Shrijith.When Kaverappa got Abhinav Tejrana’s number, caught by Nikin Jose in the slips, Goa were in disarray at 51/4. Lalit Yadav and Darshan Misal then held the innings together, facing 150 deliveries for 49 runs. When Misal, whose 12-run resistance came off 84 deliveries, tried to break free, he only sent a Yashovardhan Parantap delivery to Karun Nair at first slip. Lalit Yadav’s miscued pull ended his vigil as well. Arjun and Redkar then took centre stage, with half-chances and a couple of missed run-out opportunities frustrating Mayank Agarwal & Co. While caution was the watchword, loose balls, like a short one from Abhilash to Arjun, were not spared.Karnataka will hope for the weather to hold up on the final day.Karnataka (I innings): 371Goa (I innings; o/n 28/1): Manthan Khutkar c Shrijith b Abhilash 9, Suyash Prabhudessai c Shrijith b Kaverappa 12, Abhinav Tejrana c Jose b Kaverappa 18, Snehal Kauthankar c Shrijith b Abhilash 10, Lalit Yadav c Parantap b Abhilash 36, Darshan Misal c Karun b Parantap 12, Arjun Tendulkar (batting) 43, Mohit Redkar (batting) 24.Extras: (B-2; LB-4; NB-1): 7.Total (6 wkts; 77 overs): 171.Fall of wickets: 1-9, 2-29, 3-47, 4-51, 5-100, 6-115.Bowling: Vidwath Kaverappa 18-5-30-2, Abhilash Shetty 18-3-63-3, Yashovardhan Parantap 16-6-18-1, Vyshak Vijaykumar 17-2-41-0, Shreyas Gopal 8-2-13-0.","Arjun Tendulkar (43 batting) and Mohit Redkar (24 not out) put on 56 for the seventh wicket.

FIFA officially launched the second phase of ticket sales for the 2026 World Cup on Monday, putting another 1 million tickets up for grabs. This new phase marks the opening of a global ticket draw, which will run until 11 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday.A key feature of this round is the domestic exclusivity window for residents of the three host nations — the United States, Canada, and Mexico. During this period, local fans whose entries are selected in the draw will have the first chance to buy single-match tickets for games held in their respective countries.According to Heimo Schirgi, FIFA’s Chief Operating Officer for the tournament, interest in tickets has already been “massive” both globally and within the host nations. “This second phase, with its host country domestic exclusivity time slot, will allow us to say thank you to these local fans, while ensuring global opportunity as well,” Schirgi said.Fans from the three host nations can enter the draw until Friday. Winners will be randomly selected and granted a specific time slot between November 12 and 15 to make their ticket purchases. Notifications will be sent out at least 48 hours in advance.So far, residents of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico have led ticket purchases, followed by fans from England, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Argentina, and France. After the domestic phase ends, more slots will open globally from November 17, with further sales rounds to follow.Over 1 million tickets have already been sold, with fans from 212 countries purchasing seats. Twenty-eight of the 48 teams have qualified so far.Despite the buzz, logistical questions remain, especially around visa requirements for international visitors amid stricter U.S. immigration rules. Earlier this month, an Argentina friendly featuring Lionel Messi had to be shifted from Chicago to Fort Lauderdale due to slow ticket sales, which some linked to visa concerns.The 2026 World Cup, set across 16 venues in North America, will feature 104 matches and an estimated 7.1 million available seats. While FIFA hasn’t disclosed how many will be released to the public, base ticket prices started at $60 for select games, with premium seats — such as those for the U.S. opening match in Inglewood — priced between $560 and $2,735.In a first for the World Cup, FIFA will use, meaning ticket costs could rise or fall based on demand — a move that might push prices even higher on resale markets, where some listings have already crossed $60,000.","FIFA officially launched the second phase of ticket sales for the 2026 World Cup on Monday.

Lamine Yamal, returning from a groin injury, struggled to influence the game, sending a long-range effort well over the bar in the second half.Madrid maintained control in the closing stages, bringing on Rodrygo and Brahim Diaz, while Barcelona had few attacking options.Even a late effort from Ronald Araujo, pushed forward as a makeshift striker, failed to threaten Thibaut Courtois.Tensions boiled over in the final moments, with Pedri sent off for a second yellow card after a late foul on Aurelien Tchouameni.A brief sideline clash followed, with players from both sides involved after the final whistle.The win marks Madrid’s ninth victory in ten league games this season and highlighted their ability to perform in high-pressure matches, while Barcelona continue to manage squad limitations under Marcus Sorg, standing in for suspended coach Hansi Flick.",Real Madrid defeated Barcelona 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabéu on Sunday.

Arsenal stretched their Premier League lead to four points on Sunday thanks to Eberechi Eze’s decisive strike against his former club Crystal Palace, while Manchester City’s title hopes took a blow with a 1-0 loss at Aston Villa.Eze, who joined Arsenal in a £60 million ($80 million) move in August, netted his first Premier League goal for the Gunners with a stunning volley from Declan Rice’s free-kick six minutes before half-time. Palace failed to clear the delivery, allowing the England international to fire in the match-winner. The victory keeps Arsenal’s defence solid, marking their 10th clean sheet in 13 games across all competitions this season.Manager Mikel Arteta , however, will be concerned as Rice and William Saliba were both forced off in the second half due to injuries. Despite not hitting top gear going forward, Arsenal’s mix of defensive resilience and set-piece efficiency has proved enough to maintain their grip at the top. The Gunners now lead fourth-placed City by six points and have a seven-point cushion over sixth-placed Liverpool.Manchester City’s loss at Villa Park ended Erling Haaland’s 12-game Premier League scoring streak.Matty Cash’s spectacular strike from outside the box in the 19th minute secured a third consecutive season win for Aston Villa at home and pushed Unai Emery’s side into seventh place. Haaland had a late goal ruled out for offside, and with no other City player scoring in the league for over a month, Guardiola’s side was left frustrated.Elsewhere, Bournemouth climbed to second after beating Nottingham Forest 2-0. Marcus Tavernier opened the scoring directly from a corner, with Eli Junior Kroupi adding a second to continue his prolific run.

It's so hard and in football, everything can change in one week, so let's enjoy today and focus on the next one.""It was the first time United had won three league games in a row in the same season since February 2024.Victory also ended Brighton's winning streak in this fixture, which dated back three seasons.It is still too early to tell if Amorim has turned a corner after such a wretched start to his tenure, including the 20-time champion's worst-ever season in the Premier League last term.But coming on the heels of last week's morale-boosting win at Liverpool, the signs are positive, even if Brighton sparked a fightback to make it a nervy finish for the home fans.A prime source of encouragement for Amorim is the manner in which his summer signings have added a new dimension.Brazil forward Matheus Cunha scored his first goal for the club with a curling shot from outside the area to give United a 24th-minute lead.Another new signing, Bryan Mbeumo, also scored twice in the second half, making it three in his last two games, after Casemiro had doubled the lead with a deflected effort before the break.""The money was well invested,"" Brighton coach Fabian Hurzeler said.It was a former United player, Danny Welbeck, who gave Brighton hope with a brilliant free kick that flew into the top corner. When substitute Charalampos Kostoulas headed another goal in time added on, the tension rose inside the stadium.Then came Mbeumo's second to snuff out any chance of a collapse and ensure the winning streak continued.""This needs to be the normal for this club,"" said Cunha. ""I am so happy to be a part of this. Amazing day, I will remember this.""High-flying Sunderland Chemsdine Talbi scored Sunderland's stoppage-time winner at Stamford Bridge.Chelsea led after four minutes through Alejandro Garnacho, but Wilson Isidor leveled in the 22nd before Talbi's dramatic winner in the third minute of second-half added time.""We have a great team with great players,"" Talbi said. ""We knew we could do the job and we showed it today.""Sunderland was only promoted this season and moved to within two points of leader Arsenal, which plays Crystal Palace on Sunday.There was also a late winner at St James' Park, where Bruno Guimaraes scored in the 90th minute to seal Newcastle's 2-1 victory over Fulham.Jacob Murphy put Newcastle ahead in the 18th, but Sasa Lukic equalized in the 56th for Fulham.""We have to learn how to finish. In the first half we could have finished at least 3-0,"" Guimaraes said. ""We had a lot of chances, but I am happy in the end we scored a goal. In the last few games we have been punished at the end.""",Manchester United beats Brighton 4-2 to move up to fourth in the Premier League. Defending champion Liverpool suffers a fourth straight league loss with a 3-2 defeat at Brentford. Sunderland comes from behind to beat Chelsea 2-1 at Stamford Bridge.

Travis Kelce redeems himself with a strong second half



Kansas City Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce had a night to forget — and then remember. During Monday Night Football, Kelce saw a catchable pass slip through his hands and land with a Washington Commanders defender, drawing heavy criticism from fans and analysts alike. The early error fueled frustration as the Chiefs stumbled through a sluggish first half before Kelce found redemption later in the game.The Chiefs’ offense couldn’t find its rhythm early on against a fierce Commanders defense. Patrick Mahomes threw two interceptions in the first half — one of which came on what looked like a routine catch for Kelce. Instead, the ball bounced off his hands and straight to safety Bobby Wagner.Fans and reporters didn’t hold back. “Uh oh Travis Kelce is WASHED,” NFL reporter John Frascella wrote on X, summing up the frustration. Another fan added, “Kelce is doing a lot of damage to the Mahomes MVP campaign,” reflecting concern that Kelce’s miscue might hurt Mahomes’ MVP chances.This wasn’t the first time Kelce had turned a catchable pass into an interception. Earlier this season, in a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, he dropped a key red-zone pass that was picked off by defensive back Andrew Mukuba. After that game, Kelce admitted on his New Heights Podcast, “Gotta catch the ball.Gotta catch the ball and give ourselves a chance.”Even then, Mahomes took some blame, but Kelce owned the mistake, saying, “The ball was where it needed to be, when it needed to be there. I just have to get my head around out of the break… I just have to be able to get my head around right now so that I don’t put myself in a position to let the ball surprise me like that.”Despite the early criticism, Kelce didn’t stay down for long. He opened the second half with a 38-yard catch-and-run that set up a touchdown, flipping the game’s momentum. Later, he found the end zone himself with a 10-yard touchdown grab — his sixth catch of the day, finishing with 99 yards.Kelce’s resilience reminded everyone why he’s still one of the best in the game. Before the season, he addressed talk of retirement with trademark confidence: “For who, for me? Man, it’s the last one on the contract right now, but I’ll tell you what: I’m feeling young and I’m feeling ready to rock, baby.”Mistakes happen — even to the greats. But on Monday night, Travis Kelce showed that experience and heart can turn a rough start into a strong finish.Also Read: Laremy Tunsil injury update: ESPN broadcast reveals new details on Commanders’ Pro Bowl tackle’s hamstring issue",Kansas City Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce had a night to forget — and then remember.

Isiah Pacheco’s roots: Julio and Felicia’s unwavering support

Strength through loss and love: how tragedy shaped Isiah Pacheco



Before Isiah Pacheco became a two-time Super Bowl champion sprinting through NFL defenses, he was just a kid from Vineland, New Jersey, fueled by family, faith, and fierce determination. His story isn’t just about football glory — it’s about love, loss, and the unbreakable bond between a son and the parents who never stopped believing in him. Behind every touchdown and triumph, there’s Julio and Felicia — the heartbeat of Pacheco’s remarkable rise.Isiah Pacheco’s parents have been his foundation, both on and off the field. Julio and Felicia can often be seen cheering for their son from the stands, but their pride reached new heights in May 2025 when Isiah graduated from Rutgers University. Sharing his emotions, Julio wrote, “Sometimes in Life you got to put a pause on things for just a minute and then get Right back to it. i love you son Beyond proud of you you stuck to the plan continue to make us all proud But most importantly continue to be you the G.O.A.T congratulations I have another College Graduate!!!”Born in 1999, Isiah was the youngest of five children. He grew up surrounded by his siblings — Ricky, Felicia, Travoise, and Celeste — in a close-knit family that valued togetherness. His mother, known affectionately as “Jody,” was famous for her cooking. Isiah once joked, “She could cook, but she couldn’t cook as good as my mom.” Even as the youngest, he displayed a commanding presence. “We had to tell him you just can’t take other kids’ toys,” Felicia recalled, amused at his early leadership traits.Isiah’s coaches noticed how his upbringing shaped his character. Former Rutgers coach Nunzio Campanile said, “He’s just a great representative of his family because he’s a really good person.”Another coach, Dan Russo, noted how close he remained to his parents, even amid growing fame.The Pacheco family’s journey has not been without heartbreak. Isiah’s siblings, Travoise and Celeste, were both tragically killed while he was in high school. Their loss changed him profoundly. “My brother, if he was to see me here, he’d be shocked,” he shared. “He encouraged me to play football as a kid and he never got the opportunity to see me play.”After Celeste’s death, Isiah found solace in football. “I knew that she was looking down on me... I wanted to make her smile so I left it all out there on the field,” he said. His father noticed a deeper reflection in him afterward, admitting, “He’s thinking a lot more.”Today, Isiah channels that pain into purpose. He helps care for Celeste’s son, saying, “He really doesn’t have parents… I have to be there for him.” Felicia adds, “He warms my heart.”Through every challenge, Julio and Felicia remain his constant inspiration. “He’s a kid who has been through a lot,” Julio shared. “He doesn’t show it. He tries to keep our family happy.”Pacheco carries that love with him, literally — wearing a necklace engraved “Jody” for his mom. “It’s my mom’s nickname... She’s my heart,” he said. For Isiah Pacheco, every touchdown, every yard, and every victory is a tribute to the family that made him who he is.Also Read: Laremy Tunsil injury update: ESPN broadcast reveals new details on Commanders’ Pro Bowl tackle’s hamstring issue","Isiah Pacheco is a two-time Super Bowl champion.

Commanders lose Laremy Tunsil to hamstring injury early against Chiefs



Tunsil’s crucial role and Commanders’ growing injury crisis



The Washington Commanders’ injury crisis deepened on Monday night when star left tackle Laremy Tunsil exited early against the Kansas City Chiefs with a hamstring injury. Already dealing with a long list of sidelined players, including quarterback Jayden Daniels, Washington faced another blow to its fragile roster — this time to one of its most vital protectors.Tunsil’s exit came midway through the first quarter after Washington’s offense opened the game with a promising nine-play drive. ESPN’s Adam Schefter later shared the update that “Commanders LT Laremy Tunsil is questionable to return tonight due to a hamstring injury,” on X, formerly Twitter. Moments later, he was spotted heading to the locker room for evaluation.Sideline reporter Laura Rutledge provided further clarity during the broadcast, saying, “We are seeing that Laremy Tunsil is still in the locker room right now. He’s questionable to return with a right hamstring injury. [Brandon] Coleman is out there. They have a lot of confidence in him. We’ll keep an eye on Tunsil’s return.” However, latest reports says that he has returned.For Washington, Tunsil’s absence was immediately felt. With Marcus Mariota under center in place of Daniels, the Commanders struggled to maintain momentum after an early interception halted their first promising drive.While their defense held Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs to minimal production, losing a Pro Bowl-caliber lineman like Tunsil tested their already thin offensive depth.Tunsil, a five-time Pro Bowler acquired in a major offseason trade from the Houston Texans, has been a cornerstone of the Commanders’ rebuilt offensive line. His leadership and elite protection have anchored the unit through a turbulent season. Missing him for any significant time would have been a severe setback for head coach Dan Quinn’s team, already struggling to find rhythm amid repeated injuries.Fortunately for Washington fans, relief came late in the second quarter when Tunsil returned to the field. His reappearance brought a visible lift to the sidelines, underscoring just how essential he is to the Commanders’ offense.Still, the situation serves as a harsh reminder of the season’s theme — survival. The Commanders have endured more injuries than most teams this year, and every game feels like another battle to stay afloat. As Quinn adapts once again, one question remains: how many more hits can this team take before the toll becomes too great?Also Read: Brittany Mahomes stuns in fire-red outfit at Chiefs MNF game, effortlessly stealing Patrick Mahomes’ spotlight","Washington Commanders lost star left tackle Laremy Tunsil to a hamstring injury.

During a 2023 Instagram Q&A, Brittany shared her favorite procedure loud and clear: “Filler in my lips.”Longtime fans can easily spot the difference in photos from Brittany’s earlier days cheering from the stands.

Her lips appear fuller from both top and bottom, shifting her features into a fresh, camera-ready contour that screams confidence.And she’s far from alone. An industry survey estimated that more than 1.4 million people in the U.S. received lip enhancement treatments in 2023. A major motivator?

Kim Kardashian leaves fans guessing as she dodges questions about Tom Brady

KIM KARDASHIAN (Full Episode)

Why the insider says Tom Brady wasn’t looking for anything serious





A story too tempting for Hollywood to let go

Kim Kardashian went into her appearance on Call Her Daddy promising major revelations. She delivered plenty of juicy details about love, fame, and family feuds, but one topic had her slamming the brakes fast: Tom Brady. When host Alex Cooper tried to get the scoop on the rumored romance between Kardashian and the seven-time Super Bowl champion, the Skims founder simply refused to go there. Fans immediately took notice.Cooper pressed Kardashian with a now-viral question: how serious were she and Brady? She even followed up with whether it was “like a date?” But Kardashian put up a polite wall, answering only: “I’m not gonna answer that.”To fans who have followed the speculation since 2023, that non-answer spoke volumes. The rumors began after the two were spotted together at billionaire Michael Rubin’s Fourth of July bash in the Hamptons. Witnesses claimed they were “super flirty” and “dancing all night,” though Brady’s representatives insisted they were “just friends.”By staying coy, Kardashian sparked the rumor wildfire all over again. As one insider put it: “Kim wants everyone to believe that there was something there and by playing coy, she got the reaction she wanted.”Despite the renewed chatter, sources close to the pair insist reality never matched the headlines. According to one insider: “She shot her shot and they had a flirty vibe with each other but he wasn't interested in making it into a relationship.”There was no drama, no fallout. Just different lives heading in different directions. The source added that both stars understood they “lead two completely separate lives and they would struggle to let the other in.”Still, they’ve remained friendly. Kardashian even roasted Brady on his own Netflix special earlier this year, joking: “I wasn't going to come tonight, but since I'm not here as Tom's date, there's still a good chance I might.”Brady is newly single. Kardashian remains one of the most eligible women in Hollywood. Put those two facts in the same headline and it’s no surprise the world keeps asking: what if?But for now, the only sparks are the ones fans keep trying to fan into flame.Also Read: Did Tom Brady’s latest Instagram message take aim at Gisele Bündchen’s workout video with Joaquim Valente?","Kim Kardashian appeared on Call Her Daddy and refused to discuss rumors linking her to Tom Brady.

The viral moment that had NBA fans cheering louder than a buzzer-beater

A rising power couple blending sports, music, and star magnetism





A relationship built like a championship team

When Justin Herbert and Madison Beer showed up courtside at the Lakers game on October 24, the plan was simple: enjoy a night out after a big NFL win. Instead, the Los Angeles Chargers star ended up becoming the weekend’s most unexpected headline, proving that reflexes don’t take a day off.Late in the matchup against the Timberwolves, a stray basketball rocketed toward the couple’s seats. Without hesitation, Herbert reached up and snagged the ball mid-air, shielding a startled Madison Beer who looked moments away from a courtside collision. The crowd roared, the Jumbotron replayed it like a blockbuster stunt, and social media crowned Herbert the boyfriend of the year.The clip instantly fueled comparisons to the NFL’s biggest pop-power duo. Fans joked that Herbert just had his own “Kelce-Swift moment” with Beer flashing a grateful smile while the quarterback played real-life superhero.USA Today’s Chargers Wire summed it up perfectly: “The protective moment became the most talked-about sports clip of the weekend.”While this was their biggest public moment yet, Herbert and Beer have been quietly becoming a favorite pairing among fans of both the NFL and pop music.Beer is fresh off a major performance at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show and preparing to launch her new album Locket on January 16, 2026. Herbert, still glowing from a 3-touchdown performance the week prior, is leading the Chargers with the confidence of a franchise star.Their courtside outing wasn’t just adorable. It signaled something deeper: two careers peaking at the same time, with genuine support flowing both ways. Neither is chasing the spotlight. It’s just finding them naturally.Fans are already rooting for this duo, not because of staged moments, but because they seem real. They laugh. They show up for one another. And sometimes, they stop a basketball from rearranging someone’s face.If this is their debut season as a public couple, it’s safe to say they’re starting undefeated.Also Read: How Madison Beer and Justin Herbert fell for each other: A complete timeline of their new romance","Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert became an unexpected viral sensation after catching a stray basketball at a Lakers game.

Baking becomes Taylor Swift's stress-relief superhero while creativity never sleeps

Taylor Swift and Seth Talk The Life of a Showgirl, Travis Kelce and More

A playful outlet that taps into a different side of her creative genius

Taylor Swift may be one of the busiest artists on the planet, but she’s proving that even global icons need a hobby that lets their mind roam free. Between releasing back-to-back albums, performing three-hour concerts on the Eras Tour, and supporting Travis Kelce at Kansas City Chiefs games, Swift has found a surprising sanctuary: sourdough bread. And like everything she touches, she isn’t just dabbling. She’s turning bread into an art form.Taylor Swift told Seth Meyers that she still sleeps plenty. She simply fills every waking moment with passionately driven work. “It’s just that I don’t do anything other than this when I’m not sleeping,” she said. But breadmaking is the exception.It forces her to step away from songwriting, deadlines, and the constant hum of her career. “It’s, like, stress relief,” she explained. “Like, you’re following instructions. You’re doing a thing they’ve done for thousands of years. There’s something kind of calming about it.”In those small windows between music and stadium lights, she measures flour, scores dough, and allows yeast to take center stage. As someone wired for endless creation, baking gives her permission to be present, hands deep in something physical rather than metaphorical.Swift laughs at her own intensity. “It’s like I have when I have a hobby, it becomes an obsession, and then it becomes my entire personality,” she said. Her loaves even come dressed for the spotlight, complete with bread-bag stickers like “Are you bready for it?” and feline cameos from her beloved cats.She celebrated like a proud parent when one loaf appeared onscreen in her “Fate of Ophelia” music video. “It was a huge moment for me,” she joked, reveling in the tiny triumph of perfect feather-scoring.That delight is the real lesson. Even towering success requires something joyful, tactile, and utterly unrelated to work. For entrepreneurs and leaders constantly grinding toward the next milestone, Swift’s bread-baking ritual is a nudge to let your brain recharge in quirky, satisfying ways. Find a hobby that makes you laugh at your own obsession. It may just be the secret ingredient to sustaining creativity, ambition, and joy.Also Read: “The most doomed celebrity pairing”: Swifties slam Taylor Swift’s romance with Travis Kelce as a PR fantasy lacking real emotion","Taylor Swift has found a surprising sanctuary: sourdough bread.

Tyrese Maxey’s 43-point night puts him among the league’s hottest backcourt scorers

VJ Edgecombe’s 26-point night signals a new star rising for the Philadelphia 76ers

Tyrese Maxey’s leadership continues to shape the Philadelphia 76ers

Tyrese Maxey went off for 43 points, taking charge of the game and putting to rest any doubts about the Philadelphia 76ers early in the season. Even without their star center Joel Embiid, Maxey led the team to a 136-124 win against the Orlando Magic on October 27, 2025, helping Philadelphia achieve a 3-0 record and this is their first perfect start through three games since the 2019-20 season.Tyrese Maxey didn't just score points—he took control of the game. The 24-year-old guard, now in his fifth NBA season, dazzled against Orlando with 43 points on 15-of-32 shooting, which included 4-of-11 from three-point range and an impressive 9-of-10 from the free-throw line.He also added eight assists and four rebounds in 42 minutes, finishing with a +14 plus-minus rating. Averaging 37.0 points over three games, Maxey's second game scoring over 40 this season has made him the most exciting backcourt player in the league.What distinguished this was Maxey's assertiveness. In his PHLY breakdown, Bodner noted how Maxey has been the aggressor this season, leading with his shoulder on drives to secure clearer shots at the rim, a shift from last year's ongoing complaints about contact.During the first half, he dominated defenders for layups and fouls, scoring 17 points in the second quarter alone, which helped establish a 72-60 advantage at halftime.The spotlight definitely got brighter in the last few minutes. With the Magic closing in at 125-120, Maxey delivered a three-possession onslaught: a quick drive for a layup, a catch-and-shoot three following a VJ Edgecombe trap, and a little floater that led to an Orlando timeout and a 12-point advantage.Fans at Wells Fargo Center went wild with ""M-V-P!"" chants as he knocked down free throws, a moment Bodner referred to as one where ""you felt every shot he took was going to drop.""Adding to Maxey's impressive performance, No. 3 overall pick VJ Edgecombe made a statement with 26 points on 10-of-17 shooting, along with seven assists and three rebounds. The 20-year-old from Baylor has scored 75 points in his first three games, setting a rookie record that reminds fans of previous stars.Edgecombe's finesse masked his rookie status. He hit his first career pull-up three with a slick crossover dribble, spun into midrange jumpers that his college coach Scott Drew seldom allowed, and showcased a developing floater.Defensively, his chase-down block and a crucial steal in the late third quarter kept the leads intact. Bodner noted the duo's great synergy, ""Edgecombe and Tyrese Maxey are not just thriving together... They’re carrying the offense [and] building a vision of the future."" Together, they combined for 69 points, 15 assists, and eight rebounds—numbers Bodner deemed ""truly insane stuff.""The game was all about the sequences: Philadelphia kicked things off with a 12-0 run, setting the tone at 28-18 for the first quarter. Edgecombe's dunk at halftime pushed the lead to 79-64, a solid 15 points. Orlando made a late push in the third to stay in the game, but Maxey's clutch plays in the fourth, especially Grimes hitting three free throws after getting fouled on a three-pointer.As the final buzzer went off, Maxey's incredible 43-point performance not only defeated the Magic but also silenced any doubts. With Embiid's return on the horizon, the Sixers' backcourt pair is paving the way, one thrilling play at a time. Philadelphia's strong start shows they have what it takes to compete, demonstrating that having depth is more important than relying on a single player during the long NBA season.Also Read: Why New Orleans Pelican’s Zion Williamson missed the game against Boston Celtics","The Philadelphia 76ers beat the Orlando Magic 136-124 on October 27, 2025.

Indiana Pacers’ early-season shake-up signing Mac McClung explained

What’s next for James Wiseman?

The Indiana Pacers made a surprising roster shakeup just a week into the regular season. They waived James Wiseman to make roster space for Mac McClung. The Pacers will be signing a multi-year deal with the G-League champion, focusing on the backcourt depth. With multiple players like Tyrese Haliburton, Benedict Mathurin and others being injured, McClung will be expected to fill the void for the team. This is the player’s first standard NBA contract.The Indiana Pacers are not having a great start. With three games into the regular season, the Pacers lost all three of them. Along with the losses, the team is also facing a crisis with its guards and wings due to injuries. While star player Tyrese Haliburton has been out since Game 7 of the 2025 NBA Finals, players like Andrew Nembhard, Bennedict Mathurin, T.J. McConnell and Johnny Furphy are expected to miss the next few games due to injuries.Amid all these, the Pacers team made a major decision. As per the source, the team will be signing with Mac McClung and waiving James Wiseman. Wiseman’s performance has not been up to the mark this season. This made him the odd one out, leading to him being waived.This will be a non-guaranteed multi-year deal with McClung. The announcement first came from Shams Charania.The ESPN NBA senior insider wrote, “The Indiana Pacers are signing guard Mac McClung to a multiyear contract, Greg Lawrence of Wasserman tells ESPN. The deal marks the first standard NBA contract for McClung, after the dunk contest's first-ever three-peat champion spent time on camp and two-way deals since 2021.”To date, the player has only played six games in the league. He has played with the Los Angeles Lakers, the Chicago Bulls and the Philadelphia 76ers. With just six games, McClung averaged 5.5 points with 2.2 rebounds and 2.3 assists. The player last played in the G-League as part of the Orlando Magic.James Wiseman has joined the list of NBA free agents. The player was first drafted by the Golden State Warriors in 2020. He played two seasons with the team. Once regarded as a player with a bright future, Wiseman, however, could not perform accordingly due to several reasons. He missed the entire 2021-2022 season due to injury. Later, he was traded to the Detroit Pistons. After playing for 63 games, the player could only average 7.1 points with 5.3 rebounds. His time with the Pacers was also a short one. This season, he made an on-court appearance in just one game. Now the player is back in the open market.Wiseman is just 24 years old. The player will very likely get another chance in the future to stick around with a team for a longer period of time.Also Read: League officials make big call on Victor Wembanyama just after his game-changing start stuns NBA world",The Indiana Pacers will be signing Mac McClung to a multi-year deal.

Caitlin Clark focuses on recovery while balancing off-court commitments



Kelsey Mitchell praises Caitlin Clark’s humility amid challenges



Caitlin Clark’s sophomore season in the WNBA didn’t unfold the way Indiana Fever fans had hoped. After an electrifying rookie year that changed the landscape of women’s basketball, the 23-year-old guard spent much of 2025 battling injuries that eventually cut her season short. But as the Fever provided a surprising update on her offseason plans, it’s clear that Clark isn’t wasting any time staying active off the court.Despite averaging an impressive 16.5 points, 8.8 assists, and 5.0 rebounds per game before being sidelined, Clark was limited to just 13 appearances due to a nagging right groin strain.The Fever made the difficult call to shut her down for the remainder of the season, prioritizing long-term health over short-term success. Head coach Stephanie White opened up about the decision, saying, “Look, I would never speak for Caitlin. It’s frustrating as an athlete when you go through an injury and when you’re not able to do what you love to do... but also, the perspective of Caitlin having a long career and understanding that we’re not going to push the issue if she’s not ready to go, that’s just the reality of the situation. ”Now focused on rehab, Clark is expected to be fully healthy by the start of the 2026 WNBA season in May.Yet, the Fever’s recent update revealed she’s also taking on an unexpected new role during her recovery.On Monday, Clark joined teammates Kelsey Mitchell and Aari McDonald for a surprise motivational talk at Eli Lilly and Company, where the trio spoke to employees about “teamwork, resiliency and pushing through challenges this season.”While injuries limited Clark’s time on the hardwood, her influence inside the locker room remained profound. Fellow guard Kelsey Mitchell, who earned All-WNBA First Team honors in Clark’s absence, recently praised the young star’s maturity and selflessness.“The biggest thing that I respected about Caitlin is that she was never bigger than the program,” Mitchell said. “She wasn’t trying to take over… when she didn’t play, compared to when she did play, [her passion] remained the same.”Clark’s unwavering attitude through adversity has earned her respect across the league. With her four-year, $338,056 contract keeping her with Indiana through 2027, both the Fever and their fanbase are counting on her full recovery and another electrifying comeback when the new season tips off.Also Read: Why was LeBron James’ name dragged into NBA Gambling Scandal?

NBA faces growing crisis as investigation continues



The NBA is facing one of the most chaotic integrity issues in recent memory. A growing federal gambling investigation has shaken the league, implicating coaches and players in an underground betting scheme with alleged mafia ties. As arrests piled up, fans were stunned to see LeBron James ’ name surface in connection with the scandal. But according to documents obtained by several outlets, the Los Angeles Lakers star isn’t accused of any wrongdoing; his name came up for an entirely different reason.The controversy centers on former NBA player and coach Damon Jones, who once shared the court and, later, the locker room with LeBron James. Federal prosecutors have accused Jones of leaking confidential team information, including player injuries, to outside bettors for profit.According to the indictment filed in the Eastern District of New York, Jones sent text messages before a 2023 Lakers–Bucks game tipping off gamblers about James’ unannounced absence.“Get a big bet on Milwaukee tonight before the information is out!” Jones allegedly texted. At the time, LeBron was dealing with an ankle injury that hadn’t yet been disclosed publicly. The Lakers went on to lose 115–106 to Milwaukee, confirming what insiders already knew.The message included in the indictment continued, “[Player 3] is out tonight. Bet enough so Djones can eat too now!!!” Prosecutors later confirmed “Player 3” referred to James. The scheme reportedly earned Jones and his associates substantial winnings from bets placed before injury reports were made official.Though Jones once worked under the Lakers’ umbrella, LeBron James had no involvement or awareness of the plot, according to multiple league sources. His name was only mentioned because his injury information was used as part of the illegal betting operation — without his consent or knowledge.The fallout has been swift. Alongside Jones, Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier were arrested as part of “Operation Nothing But Bet,” a federal probe uncovering links between NBA insiders and organized gambling operations. The NBA issued a public statement confirming it was “reviewing the federal indictments” and emphasizing that “the integrity of our game remains our top priority. ”LeBron James’ inclusion in the documents showed the vulnerability of confidential locker room information in the age of legalized sports betting. Even without direct involvement, his name’s presence highlights how easily a player’s health status can become a weapon for illicit gain.As the investigation continues, the scandal threatens to reshape how the NBA polices its relationship with gambling. However, fans of LeBron can stay relaxed as the Lakers legend has not done anything wrong to destroy his image.Also Read: ""I wasn't comfortable putting myself out"": LeBron James' wife Savannah James once shared her choice to stay home as the NBA star reveals a different view today",LeBron James’ name was dragged into the Gambling Scandal through Damon Jones’ insider leak.

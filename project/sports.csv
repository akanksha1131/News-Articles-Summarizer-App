T20 World Cup: Squads, Full Schedule, Venues and Key Details Explained

Poll How important is it for countries like Italy to participate in the T20 World Cup? Very important Somewhat important Not important

CHENNAI: They grew up with the dream of representing India. But in a cricketing powerhouse bursting at the seams, that can sometimes feel like threading the eye of a needle.Even so, that hasn’t stopped the likes of Monak Patel, Saurabh Netravalkar, Jaspreet Singh and more to be part of the T20 World Cup. Across the 20 teams, 40 players with Indian roots will take the field in different colours, just not in the India ‘blue’. Canada tops the chart with 11 Indian diaspora players, followed by the US with nine. Oman and the UAE have seven each.Leading the US is 32-year-old wicketkeeper-batter Monank, who once played age-group cricket for Gujarat U-19s. Monank, who followed his family to the USA after not getting an opportunity in India, said he is grateful for a second chance in international cricket.“It’s a dream come true for many players in our team. The majority of them started their careers in India, so it’s very special. It feels different to be playing in India for the USA, but we’ve been representing them for a long time now. The decision to play for the USA was actually a ‘meantto-be’ situation for me,” Monank, who has been a vital cog in the growth of US cricket since his debut in 2019, told TOI.As Italy step on to the World Cup stage for the first time, fast bowler Jaspreet will look to carve out his own journey. Born in Phagwara, he once dreamed of playing on these very international grounds.“I came to Italy when I was very young, and today I truly feel it is my home. Every cricketer grows up dreaming of playing in a World Cup, and being here now is hard to put in words. It’s special that it is being played in India, where everything began for me. As a child, I dreamed of playing on the same international grounds where great players compete. After so many sacrifices and so much hard work, I can only be grateful, and I want to enjoy every single moment of this experience,” said Jaspreet, who once even drove an Uber in the UK to make a living.Many of them are amateur cricketers. Take the case of Netravalkar, who was quite impressive for the USA in the last T20 World Cup. The left-arm pacer is a software professional who often took leave to pursue his cricket dreams. He dismissed two of his heroes, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, in the last World Cup. During an interaction in New York after the match, he had said, “I’m just happy that I can pursue both my passions. The support that I get from my employers does help.”Off-spinner Aryan Dutt’s parents moved from India to the Netherlands before he was born. “I didn’t get the chance to return here after the 2023 World Cup. My family will be watching the game and, if time permits, I hope to go and see them too,” he said.Former Mumbai cricketer Sulakshan Kulkarni is currently Oman’s deputy coach. Having coached extensively in India’s domestic circuit, he chose to move to Oman. “This has been happening for years,” he says,“When players realise how difficult it is to break through in India, they start looking for opportunities elsewhere. Nowadays they are coming to that realisation much earlier.”","Across the 20 teams, 40 players with Indian roots will take the field in different colours.

Decoding Arshdeep Singh: Why India’s left-arm pacer could become a middle-overs weapon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/decoding-arshdeep-singh-why-indias-left-arm-pacer-could-become-a-middle-overs-weapon/articleshow/127875079.cms,"Arshdeep Singh (PTI Photo)

T20 World Cup: Squads, Full Schedule, Venues and Key Details Explained

KOCHI: Arshdeep Singh ’s Powerplay numbers in the last five T20Is — 141 runs from 10 overs — may invite criticism, even alarm. But context matters. Those overs were less a reflection of decline and more a consequence of deployment.Arshdeep has been used as a blunt instrument up front, when his real value may lie in nuance, timing and choice. The inefficiency is in using him twice in the Powerplay, a move that strips India of his influence during the most pliable phase of a T20 innings — the middle overs.Between overs 12 and 16, when batters are set but not yet unshackled, Arshdeep’s skill set is at its most disruptive. These are the overs in which pressure compounds quietly, where wickets arrive through sustained effort rather than miracle balls. Arshdeep understands how to create and sustain pressure.His evolution has been hiding in plain sight. The knuckleball that deceived Rachin Ravindra in Thiruvananthapuram was a statement of intent. Arshdeep bowls with clarity — wide yorkers that stretch the tramlines, hard lengths that grip the pitch, slower balls delivered with identical arm speed.His angles force batters to hit square rather than straight.“Arshdeep has evolved and comes with a truckload of variations to counter batters in the middle overs. He is a fantastic proposition with the semi-old ball,” says former India and Delhi pacer Sanjeev Sharma.Not long ago, Arshdeep risked being straitjacketed into a template: two overs up front, two at the death. That approach underused his range, particularly in the middle overs when batters are searching for pace and angles rather than reacting on instinct.The second T20I against New Zealand in Raipur underlined the importance of nuance. Arshdeep bowled too full, hunting swing and yorkers on a surface that demanded a different answer. The correction required was not a wholesale change, merely sharper length management.In his last 10 T20Is since Nov 2025, Arshdeep’s impact has consistently come in the middle overs, although he has been used sparingly during this phase. Against South Africa in Ahmedabad, he delivered a six-run, wicket-taking 15th over. In Vizag versus New Zealand, he bowled just one over in the middle phase and picked up a wicket. In Thiruvananthapuram, after conceding 40 runs in his opening two overs, he nabbed 4/11 in the 12th and 16th overs to extinguish the embers of a potential Kiwi heist.The pattern is clear: Arshdeep is the most effective in the middle overs. “One over with the new ball is enough to set the tone. Bring him back in the middle overs and unleash him at the death. Space him out,” Sharma said.Used in this way, India can maximise Arshdeep’s impact at the T20 World Cup.","Arshdeep has been used as a blunt instrument up front, when his real value may lie in nuance, timing and choice.

BENGALURU: India’s non-playing captain Rohit Rajpal has his fingers crossed over the availability of Sumit Nagal for the Davis Cup Qualifiers Round 1 tie against the Netherlands starting here Saturday.India’s top-ranked singles player felt a strain in his hip while playing Japan’s Rio Noguchi at the ATP Challenger 75 event in Nonthaburi, Thailand, last month. Nagal retired in the first set of his round-of-16 match and returned to India, where he has been undergoing rehabilitation.Currently ranked world No. 281, Nagal is set to begin on-court training here from Tuesday. Other squad members, including Dhakshineswar Suresh and Yuki Bhambri, are expected to join him. Karan Singh and Rithvik Bollipalli have already begun training under Rajpal’s watchful eye. “We certainly have a concern with his injury. The physios are working hard with him and we’re keeping our fingers crossed,” Rajpal said.Nagal had also battled illness and a back injury during the first half of 2025.“He’s been in rehab for the last couple of weeks and we’re slowly building him up. We’re happy with his progress. He trained on the court twice in Delhi. From Tuesday onwards, we’ll start to put him under pressure — in sets and match situations. That’s when we’ll really know,” Rajpal added.","India's top-ranked singles player felt a strain in his hip while playing Japan’s Rio Noguchi at the ATP Challenger 75 event in Nonthaburi, Thailand, last month.

Former captain Rashid Latif on Pakistan boycotting India T20 World Cup match

PCB may have to pay the broadcasters

NEW DELHI: The upcoming ICC T20 World Cup is set to suffer a big jolt with the Pakistan govt on Sunday announcing that its cricket team will boycott its league match against India in Colombo on February 15. While Pakistan govt didn’t provide any reason for the move, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi had warned of drastic steps after Bangladesh was replaced with Scotland on January 24.The International Cricket Council (ICC) reacted sharply to development, stating: “ICC hopes PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.”“The ICC notes the statement that the govt of Pakistan has made regarding the decision to instruct its national team to selectively participate in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026. While the ICC awaits official communication from the Pakistan Cricket Board, this position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule,” an ICC statement said.Sources told TOI that ICC could contemplate expelling Pakistan from the World Cup and future ICC tournaments if the PCB goes ahead with boycotting the scheduled match against India.The govt of Pakistan’s official handle posted the decision on X. “The Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan grants approval to the Pakistan cricket team to participate in the ICC World T20 2026, how- ever, the Pakistan Cricket Team shall not take the field in the match scheduled on 15th February 2026 against In- dia,” the post read.It needs to be seen what Pakistan’s stance will be if they are drawn with India for the tournament semifinal. If the match doesn’t happen, broadcasters and the sponsors will incur enormous losses as the fixture has generated a major chunk of revenue from ICC tournaments over the last decade, as diplomatic relationship between the two countries froze. For the match to be forfeited in favour of India, the Indian team must be at the ground at the time of toss. According to ICC’s playing conditions, Pakistan will lose two points from the match and their net run rate will also take a hit. India and Pakistan are in Group A with USA, Namibia and Netherlands. Two teams from the group will qualify for the Super 8 stage.Over the last decade, ICC tournaments have always been guaranteed of at least one India-Pakistan match in the group stages. Each match has broken viewership records.Despite PCB struggling to generate revenue, it gets the fourth highest share of ICC’s annual revenue based on the revenue generated through India-Pakistan matches. PCB currently gets $34.5 million annually from ICC. Sources said ICC could penalise PCB by asking them to financially compensate for the loss of revenue from this match. The world body also mulls denying giving out No Objection Certificates to players across the globe to participate in the Pakistan Super League If ICC decides to compensate broadcasters from PCB’s annual share of ICC revenue, then PCB could stand to lose around 70-80% of $34.5 million that they currently receive from ICC.

But in a cricketing powerhouse bursting at the seams, that can sometimes feel like threading the eye of a needle.But that hasn’t stopped the likes of Monak Patel, Saurabh Netravalkar, Jaspreet Singh and a few more to be part of the T20 World Cup that will start in India and Sri Lanka on Saturday.

Having coached extensively in India’s domestic circuit, Kulkarni understands the depth of competition back home and sees that as the reasons for so many players eventually looking beyond Indian shores.“This has been happening for years. When players realise how difficult it is to break through in India, they start looking for opportunities elsewhere and nowadays they are coming to that realisation much earlier. If representing another country gives them a chance to play at the Asia Cup or World Cup and earn a living, why wouldn’t they?” said Kulkarni, adding that the Indian quotient adds a lot of spice to these teams.","40 players with Indian roots will take the field in different colours.

The backup options



Poll Do you think Tilak Varma will perform well in his upcoming T20 World Cup matches? Yes, he will shine. No, he will struggle.

Team India to assemble on February 3



Brief Score:

The police sirens weren’t blaring, hundreds hadn’t assembled to catch a glimpse of the team bus, and an eerie silence hung over the porch of the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai. A handful of security guards and police personnel were enjoying their afternoon sweet spot after a hearty lunch when the India A team bus pulled in. Chairs were reluctantly ditched as they snapped into an alert position, albeit only for a few minutes.The players started getting off the bus, but the attention and camera pans, only two to be precise, were on Tilak Varma. Set for his first competitive appearance after almost a month, the 23-year-old got into the act straight away. While the rest underwent an extended warm-up and catching drills, Tilak, after a light throwdown session of driving near the ropes, joined Ravi Bishnoi on the practice pitches to bowl.And it wasn’t just gentle deliveries to loosen up the shoulder as he spent considerable time bowling to the likes of Bishnoi, Ashok Sharma, Manav Suthar, Khaleel Ahmed and Mayank Yadav. Even when the captains had lined up for the toss, Tilak wasn’t done yet.Only after USA’s decision to bowl first flashed on the giant screen did the left-hander get the cue and rush to the dugout to pad up.India’s designated No. 3 for the upcoming T20 World Cup was short on match practice due to a groin injury, but after extended rehabilitation and match simulations at the BCCI Centre of Excellence, he picked up from where he had left off in his last appearance for the country. There were no visible signs of rust as the youngster went about his business exactly as he did in the home T20I series against South Africa.He took the left-arm spin on, found gaps with precision, brought out the reverse sweep and even flexed his muscles with a maximum. His knock of 38 off 23 ended when he edged a Shubham Ranjane delivery behind to the wicketkeeper, but Tilak ticked the boxes he would have wanted after spending time away from cricket. The left-hander remains a crucial piece in India’s T20 World Cup puzzle and his return now leaves the selectors with a straightforward call between Sanju Samson and Ishan Kishan for the second opener and wicketkeeper’s spot.Samson was woefully out of form in the five T20Is against New Zealand, while Kishan made his opportunities count and even donned the gloves for the final T20I. Captain Suryakumar Yadav had said the call would be revealed on February 7, but recent form and confidence tilt heavily in Kishan’s favour.“The final call on Ishan Kishan versus Sanju Samson for the opener role will be revealed on February 7,” Surya had said in an interaction with the broadcaster.Indian management have persisted with out-of-form players in T20Is, including captain SKY, but it will be interesting to see whether they follow the same route for a multi-nation tournament.After Tilak, the second talking point from India A’s warm-up against USA was the potential backup options in case Washington Sundar does not recover in time for the T20 World Cup. While the all-rounder is making progress at the BCCI Centre of Excellence, the management will want a Plan B in place for a campaign that gets underway on February 7 at the Wankhede Stadium.As TimesofIndia.com had reported earlier, the management is likely to take a patient approach with Washington as they need an option for match-ups against left-handers. For those match-ups, Ravi Bishnoi was drafted into the squad for the T20Is against New Zealand and returned figures of 2/18 and 1/49 in his two outings. Even in the Navi Mumbai fixture, the leg-spinner, whose stock ball moves away from left-handers, picked up a wicket in his first over, the third of the innings, when he cleaned up opposition captain Monank Patel for 10. Another wicket followed in his second over as he finished with figures of 3/37 in four overs.Tilak too got into the act when he was introduced ahead of the likes of Ayush Badoni and Riyan Parag. The part-timer picked up a wicket with his first ball before Parag was introduced from the other end. There is no need to panic yet, but the think-tank does not want to leave anything to chance, even when it comes to replacement options for a player like Washington, who is unlikely to feature in the playing XI for most games. One over each for Tilak, Parag and Badoni does not drop any major hints either.The Suryakumar Yadav-led Indian team will assemble in Mumbai on Tuesday ahead of the warm-up fixture against South Africa on February 4. Most players, head coach Gautam Gambhir and members of the support staff had gone home during the two-day break after the New Zealand series but will now return to business.As far as the relaxed security personnel at DY Patil Stadium are concerned, they were kept on their toes when a decent crowd turned up for the India A-USA game. It will be busier for the India-South Africa fixture, with close to 20,000 tickets already sold, and the post-lunch sweet spot is unlikely on Wednesday.India A posted 238/3 in 20 overs and then bowled out USA for 200 in 19.4 overs, sealing a comfortable 38-run victory.",Tilak Varma scores 38 off 23 balls in India's T20 World Cup warm-up match against USA. The 23-year-old had been out for almost a month with a groin injury. His return leaves the selectors with a straightforward call between Sanju Samson and Ishan Kishan for the second opener and wicketkeeper’s spot.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127866203,imgsize-126802,width-400,resizemode-4/india-south-africa-cricket.jpg"

NEW DELHI: 47/0 was the scoreline. Four balls later, it became 47/3. A sense of unease crept in as India looked to have lost the early momentum against Pakistan during their crucial U19 World Cup 2026 match on Sunday.Against the same opponent, India had already conceded the plot recently, in the U19 Asia Cup final.And when the hype around Vaibhav Sooryavanshi and Ayush Mhatre died down with their early dismissals, the need of the hour was the emergence of a saviour. In stepped, Ahmedabad-based batter Vedant Trivedi.When India needed a hero, Vedant, chipping in with a 98-ball 68, became the villain for Pakistan.Trivedi showed remarkable discipline on a pitch which was difficult to bat on, rescuing the Indian team from a precarious situation and enabling them to post a total of 252.The 18-year-old cricketer pulled off a strong comeback, having failed to cross the 15-run mark in previous matches, and now finishing as the top run-getter.""My initial few shots against Pakistan connected quite well, sparking confidence that it would be my day. The focus was on batting as long as possible. Runs weren't flowing freely off the bat in the previous matches. I just told myself to focus on crossing the 30-run mark during that phase, as net sessions were going well,"" said Vedant during an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com.While the 18-year-old cricketer's strong mentality certainly reflected in his shot selection, he maintains the same intent even off the field.Trivedi hasn't consumed sugar since the age of 10, abstaining from eating biscuits in a strong show of internal discipline and clarity.The Gujarat batter idolises Shubman Gill as his association with the game began in a similar manner to that of the Team India captain, considering the role played by his father.Interestingly, the cricketer also emulated Gill's celebration in a domestic match.Trivedi's father Alpesh used to bowl 300 deliveries daily to him, developing a strong initial framework with emphasis on technique rather than power. Eventually, the 18-year-old cricketer joined a coaching academy, which further involved sacrifices, travelling between 80 to 100 kilometers per day.Trivedi worked extensively with coaches Hem Joshipura and Jesal Karia, refining his gameplay.Joshipura helped imbibe awareness and clarity regarding the batter's strengths and the areas where work was deemed necessary.""The best part is that he implemented the feedback immediately. Vedant worked upon taking quick singles, hitting boundaries down the ground as well as maintaining patience. I told him power is not the only necessity to score runs, which propelled his consistency to the next level especially during the last edition of the Cooch Behar Trophy,"" stated the Gujarat coach.Karia worked upon Trivedi's gameplay against pace, helping him react in a sharper manner. There was also specific training for the ongoing World Cup, enhancing the number of shots which could be deployed against spinners considering the wickets in Zimbabwe. Karia developed Trivedi's comfort levels while playing the cut and pull shot, boosting his ability to switch gears with some technical adjustments.""Initially, Vedant couldn't concert his 40s into centuries leaving him very disappointed. However, he responded well and overcame that by batting for six hours daily. Many people feel that batting in an orthodox manner reduces scope to score runs. However, Vedant is well capable of accelerating when the chips are down despite his traditional gameplay,"" stated Karia.The 18-year-old cricketer wasn't picked in the U-19 squad for a tour of England in 2025, leaving him in a state of dismay. However, Trivedi took the snub as a challenge, finishing among the only two centurions during a series of matches conducted at the Center of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru.The consistent performances soon earned the batter a spot in the squad for a tour of Australia, where he finished as the top run-getter.Trivedi drew inspiration from Sourav Ganguly, who has influenced his approach, in order to excel during the overseas tour.""Vedant saw a video of Ganguly where he discussed the shots which can be played in Australian conditions considering the importance of control on such wickets. He followed the approach discussed thoroughly, enhancing his comfort levels massively. There was also specific focus on a lot of training drills, facing synthetic balls to develop greater fluency,"" stated the cricketer's father.Impressively, Trivedi was back on the training ground just the day after landing in India following the Australian tour, showcasing his commitment levels and focus on the process.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha on Monday confirmed that the players will abide by whatever directives are issued by the government and the cricket board regarding the boycott of the high-profile T20 World Cup clash against India on February 15 in Colombo. Speaking to the media before departing from Lahore with the squad for Sri Lanka, Salman said the team manager informed the players of the decision on Sunday, shortly after their match against Australia.“We are players contracted to the Board and whatever decision our government and Board have taken all the players are on board with it,” he said.Salman added that the T20 World Cup campaign was about more than just the India fixture, stressing that the team’s focus was on delivering strong performances throughout the tournament.“We have three other group matches so we will try to win all of them and qualify for next round,” he said.Several former Pakistan captains, including Shahid Afridi, Muhammad Yousuf and Rashid Latif, along with ex-players Moin Khan, Sarfaraz Ahmed and Mohsin Khan, have publicly backed the decision to skip the India match.“What the ICC did to Bangladesh or the way they have bowed before the Indian cricket board in recent years, it was time someone took a stand,” Latif said.Afridi admitted disappointment over not playing India, reiterating his belief in keeping politics separate from sport, but said he understood the reasoning behind the move.“The ICC now has to decide which path it wants to take in the larger interests of world cricket,” Moin said.Sarfaraz also expressed that he could understand why the Pakistan Cricket Board did not receive clearance to play against India.Amid the ongoing developments, the Pakistan squad departed for Colombo to take part in their remaining matches in the tournament, which begins on February 7. The team is expected to arrive in the Sri Lankan capital later on Monday.A senior PCB source said the board would continue to follow government instructions if another meeting with India arises in the knockout stages.Pakistan are set to open their campaign against the Netherlands on February 7, followed by group games versus the USA on February 10 and Namibia on February 18, provided the boycott of the India fixture remains in place.Pakistan’s unexpected decision to skip the February 15 match is being viewed as a gesture of solidarity with Bangladesh, who were excluded from the tournament after declining to travel to India over security concerns.","Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha says players will abide by whatever directives are issued by the government and the cricket board.

Bottom line:

NEW DELHI: An India–Pakistan clash at an ICC tournament is estimated to generate a staggering “USD 250 million (over Rs 2200 crore)” in revenue, and the absence of this blockbuster fixture from the upcoming T20 World Cup is expected to result in massive financial losses for all stakeholders.The rivalry between the two neighbours, who only meet in multi-nation events because of strained bilateral relations, is so commercially powerful that the ICC routinely places them in the same group at global tournaments.On Sunday, the Pakistan government officially announced its decision to boycott the high-profile match in Colombo scheduled for February 15.Should Pakistan stick to its stance, it risks forfeiting millions in revenue, while a walkover would also inflict significant financial damage on the ICC and India’s media rights holder JioStar, which is already attempting to renegotiate a USD 3 billion agreement with the world body.The host broadcaster is likely to suffer advertising losses estimated between Rs 200 crore and Rs 250 crore, given that a 10-second commercial slot during the marquee encounter can fetch as much as Rs 40 lakh.Although India would receive full points in the event of a walkover, the ICC still holds the power to levy financial penalties on the PCB.USD 250 million (Rs 2,200+ crore)Around Rs 200–250 croreUp to Rs 40 lakhUSD 3 billion (JioStar–ICC)Amount not disclosed, but permitted under ICC regulationsUSD 35.5 millionUSD 250 million vs USD 35.5 millionNearly 7x Pakistan’s yearly income1+ billion viewers worldwideIndia get full pointsICC, broadcaster, sponsors and PCB face major financial impactOne abandoned India–Pakistan fixture = hundreds of crores lost across ICC, broadcasters and sponsors, plus reputational damage to the tournament.Former ICC and PCB communications chief Sami-ul-Hasan Burney highlighted the scale of money involved in a single India–Pakistan game.""As regards the sanctions or the losses, as I said, the one match is costing USD 250 million (everything accounted for not just broadcaster's loss). Pakistan's annual revenue is USD 35.5 million, so there is a big, big difference,"" he told PTI.The Sydney Morning Herald, citing industry sources familiar with confidential negotiations, reported that each India–Pakistan contest is valued at around USD 250 million, driven by an audience exceeding a billion viewers.The ICC’s response to Pakistan’s announcement also reflected the unmatched importance of the fixture.""This position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule,"" the ICC said.""ICC tournaments are built on sporting integrity, competitiveness, consistency and fairness, and selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competitions.""Despite the uncertainty, Pakistan have departed for Colombo to play their remaining matches in the tournament, which begins February 7.With the ICC, PCB and BCCI having agreed to a hybrid model for India–Pakistan fixtures until 2027, the Pakistan board may find it difficult to justify a selective withdrawal.The chain of events began with Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman’s removal from the IPL on BCCI instructions, which ultimately led to Bangladesh pulling out of the ICC event co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.","ICC, broadcaster, sponsors and PCB face major financial impact.

T20 World Cup: Squads, Full Schedule, Venues and Key Details Explained

NEW DELHI: Former ICC head of communications Sami-ul-Hasan Burney has criticised the BCCI ’s handling of Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman ’s exit from the Indian Premier League, saying the Indian board could have prevented the current T20 World Cup turmoil with a more measured approach.Rahman’s release from his Kolkata Knight Riders contract set off a chain reaction that eventually led to Bangladesh withdrawing from the tournament, starting February 7, after citing “security concerns” over travelling to India. In a show of solidarity, Pakistan have since opted to forfeit their February 15 clash against arch-rivals India following government directives.Burney, who later served as media director of the Pakistan Cricket Board after leaving the ICC, felt the situation escalated unnecessarily because of public communication around Rahman’s removal.""I mean, things could have been easily avoided if the cricket administrators or people responsible for the game had been a little bit more careful and avoided public statements, like a Bangladesh player (Mustafizur) has to be removed from the franchise,"" Sami told PTI.""I mean they (the BCCI) didn't have to say it publicly. They could have easily privately told the franchise (KKR) to release the player and nobody would have known what happened and life would have moved on.""Sometimes you make an error of judgment and make a statement which has implications. So the January 3 announcement became a trigger,"" he explained.A former journalist with The Dawn, Burney spent over a decade at the ICC’s Dubai headquarters before joining the PCB last year. He also shed light on the thinking of PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who also serves as Pakistan’s interior minister.Burney said Naqvi views the ICC’s refusal to move Bangladesh’s matches from India to Sri Lanka as a case of “shifting of goalposts.”""I refer back to November, 2024, when I was a part of the Pakistan Cricket Board, and I was with Mr Mohsin Naqvi, when that e-mail came in which the ICC said the BCCI has informed them that the Indian government has refused permission to send their team to Pakistan.""Mr. Naqvi believes when a similar situation arose in January (with regards Bangladesh), the same principles were not applied, and that is where he is referring to the double standards.""I think that is what is upsetting Mr. Naqvi and the PCB, because they think goalposts are being changed, or shifted.""On whether Bangladesh’s dispute with India was Pakistan’s battle, Burney said: ""We may agree with it, we may disagree with this decision, we may argue...but when the government makes a decision, they are looking at something bigger than what what you and I are seeing.""While the ICC has hinted at possible sanctions, including heavy financial penalties, Burney insisted Pakistan would have weighed all consequences.""I mean, these decisions are not easy decisions to make. They must have spoken to a lot of people, sought the advice from the experts, looked at the legal side.""I am sure an extensive exercise would have taken place before the government of Pakistan made that decision. As regards the sanctions or the losses you are talking about, that one match is costing USD 250 million (everything accounted for not just broadcaster's loss).""Pakistan's annual revenue is USD 35.5 million, so there is a big, big difference,"" he said.He added that Pakistan have previously weathered financial setbacks from not playing India bilaterally.""...unlike other countries, Pakistan have not hosted India for 20 years in a bilateral series, even though they have toured India twice in 2007 and then 2012-13 for white-ball cricket.""They have not played, I mean, they were playing off-shore for 10 years, 2009 to 2019 not at home, but in the Middle East, or in the UAE, and still managed to win two tournaments, the T20 World Cup in 2009 and 2017 Champions Trophy,"" he said.""So, yes, there will be financial implications, but if Pakistan Cricket Board can survive that 20-year period without playing India, they can sustain.""",Sami-ul-Hasan Burney has criticised the BCCI's handling of Mustafizur Rahman's exit.

ISL media rights packages:

The broadcast rights for the Indian Super League (ISL) 2025-26 season have been awarded to FanCode after their technical and commercial bids edged six other competitors. Kaleidoscope Production and Services (KPS Studios), meanwhile, have been awarded the production rights for the world feed. All India Football Federation (AIFF) opened the bids on Monday having released the Request for Proposal (RFP) tender on January 18.AIFF Deputy Secretary General M Satyanarayan said, “We are pleased to have concluded the ISL media rights process and to partner with FanCode, one of India’s leading sports platforms. FanCode’s focus on accessibility and fan experience aligns with our objective of expanding the league’s footprint and engaging more football fans across the country.”FanCode had shown interest in Packages A, B and D which covered world feed production, linear TV and digital streaming. But they will be responsible for only the linear TV and digital broadcasts for the 91-match league. The previous broadcast deal was worth Rs 275 crore/season (Rs 1.68 crore/match).“The Indian Super League is a significant addition to FanCode, as it represents the very best of Indian football. With the league’s strong and loyal fan following, we see a big opportunity to elevate how fans experience ISL through reliable, high-quality broadcast and a product designed around modern football audiences. This is in line with Dream Sports group’s overall vision of making sports better,” said FanCode co-founder Yannick Colaco in a statement.FanCode's initial bid of Rs 8.62 crore for Package A remains to be ratified considering they will not be responsible for the production of the ISL. That job has been awarded to Kolkata-based KPS Studios LLP, who had only for Package E. KPS Studios had previously handled the production of I-League, Durand Cup and Bengal Super League matches.FanCode, UK-based Two Circles, Anandabazar Patrika (ABP), JioStar, Monarch with PR Solutions, Sportzworks and Kaleidoscope (KPS Studios) had shown interest in broadcasting and producing the ISL.Two Circles and Monarch with PR Solutions were both disqualified during the commercial bids evaulation part of the process. The others progressed forwardAfter two rounds of clarifications, final submissions were received before the February 1 deadline. Sony Sports and Zee Sports had attended the pre-bid meeting but stayed away from making a final push.The AIFF reached a conclusion on the broadcast rights winner on the basis of a combination of technical and commercial bids. After technical bids were evaluated on the basis of broadcast and production experience, infrastructure and cameras, platform reach and prior experience, the process moved to the commercial bids.As per the final scoring formula, the bidders were adjudged on a 70:30 weightage formula with 70% going towards the technical know-how and rest on the financial metric.The current tentative schedule sees the truncated ISL season get underway on February 14 with a double-header between Mohun Bagan SG vs Kerala Blasters and FC Goa vs Inter Kashi.

NEW DELHI: Bengaluru FC players, including India legend Sunil Chhetri , have agreed to take a pay cut for the truncated Indian Super League (ISL) season starting February 14, with club owner Parth Jindal thanking the squad for making the “sacrifice” in the best interests of both the franchise and the sport.Jindal said the management held open and honest discussions with the first-team players about “navigating the situation the sport finds itself in,” as the delayed ISL prepares to restart after being paused for more than four months.Highlighting the challenges facing Indian football, Jindal took to X to explain the club’s position.""Everyone is well aware of the challenging phase Indian Football is going through. For me, as BFC team owner and someone who is deeply passionate about the sport and the club, this has been one of the toughest periods ever,"" Jindal wrote on 'X'.""I am grateful to all the first team players who have agreed to reduce their remuneration during this phase.""Without a doubt, this was one of the toughest decisions we have had to make as a club, and I truly appreciate that the players have made this sacrifice in the best interests of the club and the sport.""Jindal had earlier urged players across clubs to “make sacrifices” citing the “financial burden” franchises would face to participate in the delayed league, even warning that without player support his club might have to “shut shop for good.” While he had not detailed the nature of the sacrifice at the time, he hinted at salary reductions for the season.Bengaluru FC’s squad includes former India captain Sunil Chhetri and star goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu. The club has also appointed former India international Renedy Singh as first-team head coach for the upcoming campaign.Last month, FC Goa players, including India captain Sandesh Jhingan, along with support staff, also accepted pay cuts for the shortened season, with the club calling it a “selfless” move and saying it was “deeply humbled by this gesture and immensely grateful for the unity, character, and commitment shown by the group.” FC Goa’s roster also features India players Udanta Singh and Boris Singh.The ISL 2025–26 season was thrown into uncertainty after former organiser FSDL ended its Master Rights Agreement with the AIFF on December 8. Although a tender for a new commercial partner drew no bidders, intervention from the sports minister and negotiations ensured all 14 clubs confirmed participation. A truncated season featuring 91 matches will be played on a home-and-away basis, with each team contesting 13 games.The AIFF has since issued the Request for Proposal for broadcast rights, with bids set to open on February 2. Clubs will bear 60 per cent of the league’s financial cost, estimated at Rs 25 crore. Fixtures are expected to be announced soon.","Bengaluru FC players have agreed to take a pay cut for the truncated Indian Super League (ISL) season starting February 14.

Aston Villa's Premier League title ambitions were dented by a loss to 10-man Brentford on Sunday and Manchester United collected a third straight win under new manager Michael Carrick.Villa played for more than half the match with an extra man after Brentford winger Kevin Schade's straight red card for kicking out at Matty Cash in the 42nd minute. In the first minute of first-half stoppage time, Dango Ouattara scored the only goal in Brentford's 1-0 win.Third-place Villa stayed seven points behind leader Arsenal, which beat Leeds 4-0 on Saturday, and was getting caught up by an improving United under Carrick.Fresh off unexpected victories over Arsenal and Manchester City, United beat Fulham 3-2 thanks to a goal in the fourth minute of stoppage time by substitute Benjamin Sesko at Old Trafford.United squandered a two-goal lead earned by goals from Casemiro and Matheus Cunha, with Raul Jimenez — via a penalty — and Kevin scoring to bring Fulham briefly level.The match took place after a protest by around 500-600 United fans unhappy at the ownership of the 20-time champions, but the team is finally in a decent league position — fourth place — in its bid to return to the Champions League.United is five points behind Villa with 14 rounds remaining.Man City was playing away against Tottenham later.Also Sunday, Crystal Palace — without star striker Jean-Philippe Mateta ahead of his possible move to AC Milan — drew 1-1 at 10-man Nottingham Forest, which had Neco Williams sent off in the 45th minute for a handball on the line.",Manchester United beats Fulham 3-2 at Old Trafford.

Atletico, Villarreal drop points in draws

Barcelona missed several clear chances but still moved four points clear at the top of La Liga with a 3-1 win at Elche on Saturday.

Alexander Sorloth and Pablo Barrios were both forced off injured, which affected Atletico’s performance.""It hurts not to get the three points today,"" admitted Atletico defender Robin Le Normand.To make matters worse for Atletico striker Alexander Sorloth and midfielder Pablo Barrios went off injured.They lost Sorloth after a clash of heads with Matias Moreno and the Norwegian striker was taken to hospital for further tests.Barrios limped off early in the second half and Atletico, who had started well, struggled to create many openings after that, missing the energetic midfielder.Simeone, who has pushed for Atletico to sign more players, said the potential injury absences would force him to think about what to do.""It enhances creativity, the coach's work. As a coach, it's good to be challenged to improve, and this helps me improve,"" he said.Villarreal led twice through Gerard Moreno but they could only manage to draw at Osasuna.They remain fourth in the table, eight points clear of fifth-placed Espanyol, who lost 2-1 to Alaves.""We wanted to win but I think we have to leave satisfied, because we got a point after two games without (getting any),"" Moreno told Movistar.","Barcelona move four points clear at the top of La Liga with 3-1 win at Elche.

Arsenal settled any fears of a wobble in their pursuit of a first Premier League title in 22 years by winning 4-0 at Leeds on Saturday.The Gunners' advantage over Manchester City and Aston Villa, who are both in action on Sunday, stretches to seven points as Mikel Arteta 's men took another step towards the title at Elland Road.A first home defeat of the season last weekend to Manchester United capped a run of just two points from a possible nine in Arsenal's previous three league games.After finishing runners-up for the past three seasons, questions were raised over the mentality of Arteta's men to get over the line in a title race.The visitors were dealt another blow before kick-off as Bukayo Saka was injured in the warm-up.But his replacement Noni Madueke played a major part in inflicting just a second defeat in 12 games on Leeds.Madueke's cross was headed in by Martin Zubimendi to open the scoring.Leeds goalkeeper Karl Darlow could then only parry another dangerous delivery from the England winger into his own goal before half-time.Despite a fine run of form, Leeds remain only six points above the relegation zone.Their first defeat at home since November was confirmed when the much-criticised Viktor Gyokeres latched onto Gabriel Martinelli's cross to blast in his 11th goal since joining Arsenal from Sporting Lisbon.Gabriel Jesus came off the bench to round off the scoring with a blistering strike four minutes from time.Arsenal will be hoping local rivals Tottenham can do them a favour when City visit north London, while Villa host Brentford on Sunday.Chelsea can climb into the top four later should they maintain their bright start under Liam Rosenior against West Ham at Stamford Bridge.Liverpool are aiming to ease the pressure on Arne Slot at Anfield in Saturday's late kick-off when they host Newcastle.Everton snatched a 1-1 draw at Brighton thanks to Beto's 97th-minute equaliser in a result that does little for either side's aspirations of European football next season.Pascal Gross' first goal since returning to the Seagulls from Borussia Dortmund put Brighton in front.Bournemouth ended any remaining worries of being dragged into a relegation fight as goals from Eli Kroupi and Alex Scott earned a 2-0 win at bottom-of-the-table Wolves.The Cherries climb up to 12th and 13 points clear of the relegation zone.",Arsenal beat Leeds 4-0 at Elland Road to extend their lead to seven points.

The German football federation has ruled out a boycott of the World Cup despite calls from within to send a message to U.S. President Donald Trump “We believe in the unifying power of sport and the global impact that a FIFA World Cup can have, the federation said in a statement issued late Friday. “Our goal is to strengthen this positive force — not to prevent it. ”The federation, known as the DFB, said its executive committee met and discussed the option of a boycott of the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico, a consideration first proposed last week by DFB vice president Oke Göttlich.Göttlich, who is also the president of Bundesliga club St. Pauli, referred to Trump's recent actions and statements and said it was time to “seriously consider” a boycott.In what appears to be a public rebuke to Göttlich, however, the DFB said “debates on sports policy should be conducted internally and not in public.”The DFB said a boycott “is not currently under consideration. The DFB is in contact with representatives from politics, security, business, and sports in preparation for the tournament” from June 11-July 19.Trump has sowed discord in Europe with his takeover bid for Greenland and threats to impose tariffs on European countries that opposed it, while U.S.actions in Venezuela and at home in dealing with protests in American cities have also raised alarm.Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter last week advised fans to stay away from the tournament.When president, however, Blatter opposed calls to boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia over concerns about Ukraine.“Football can not be boycotted in any country,” he said at the time.Ahead of this summer's tournament, fans have concerns about high ticket prices, while travel bans imposed by the Trump administration could also prohibit supporters from some competing nations from attending.Germany’s team, at least, will be there.“We want to compete fairly against the other qualified teams next summer,” the DFB said. “And we want fans worldwide to celebrate a peaceful festival of football in the stadiums and at fan zones — just as we experienced at the 2024 European Championship in our own country.”","The German football federation has ruled out a boycott of the World Cup despite calls from within to send a message to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Poll How do you feel about the crowd's behavior during the African Cup final? Completely unacceptable A result of passion Somewhat understandable

Africa’s football governing body has handed down fines exceeding $1 million and imposed multiple bans following a chaotic African Cup final that descended into protests, crowd trouble and ugly scenes on and off the pitch.The Confederation of African Football (CAF) announced the sanctions on Wednesday in response to the disorder-marred final between Senegal and hosts Morocco on January 18, a match that featured a dramatic walk-off protest, fans attempting to storm the field and even scuffles involving journalists. Crucially, CAF clarified that the bans apply only to African competitions and will not affect the upcoming World Cup in June, for which both Senegal and Morocco have already qualified.CAF fined the Senegalese Football Federation $615,000 and the Moroccan federation $315,000 for unsporting and improper conduct by players, coaching staff and supporters. Senegal coach Pape Thiaw received the heaviest individual punishment — a five-match ban in CAF competitions and a personal fine of $100,000 — after leading his players off the pitch in protest at a late penalty awarded to Morocco.The final was halted for around 15 minutes following the walk-off.When play resumed, Morocco missed the penalty and Senegal went on to clinch the African title with a 1-0 win after extra time.The fallout extended far beyond the walk-off. Supporters tried to breach the pitch, players from both teams clashed on the sidelines, and reporters from Senegal and Morocco were involved in fights in press areas. One of the most bizarre flashpoints came when Moroccan ball boys attempted to snatch a towel from Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy, apparently to distract him. That incident alone resulted in an additional $200,000 fine for Morocco’s federation.Morocco coach Walid Regragui later described the spectacle as giving African football a “shameful” image, a comment that resonated as scrutiny intensified on the country, which will co-host the 2030 World Cup with Spain and Portugal and hopes to stage the final at the 115,000-capacity Hassan II Stadium currently under construction.CAF also banned Senegal’s Iliman Ndiaye and Ismaila Sarr for two matches each, while Morocco’s Achraf Hakimi received a two-match ban with one suspended. Ismael Saibari was hit with a three-match ban and a $100,000 fine for unsporting behaviour.An appeal by Morocco to have the result annulled and the title awarded to them was dismissed. The match even strained diplomatic ties, though Senegal Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko later played down the fallout, calling the reaction “emotional outbursts produced by fervor” rather than a deeper rift.","Africa's football governing body hands down fines exceeding $1 million.

The Chinese Football Association (CFA) announced Thursday that 73 people, including former national team coach Li Tie, have been banned for life, and 13 professional clubs have been fined for match-fixing and corruption.The punishments come as part of a wider anti-corruption campaign under President Xi Jinping, which has removed several CFA officials and banned dozens of players for match-fixing and gambling.The statement did not say when the most recent match-fixing occurred or give details of the cases.The punishments were made after a ""systematic review"" and were needed ""to enforce industry discipline, purify the football environment, and maintain fair competition"", the CFA wrote on its official social media account Thursday.Li Tie, a former Everton player who coached China’s national team from 2019 to 2021, is already serving a 20-year prison sentence for bribery, after being sentenced in December 2024.Chen Xuyuan, former CFA chairman, is also serving a life sentence for accepting $11 million in bribes.Of the 16 teams in the 2025 Chinese Super League, 11 will face point deductions and fines.Tianjin Jinmen Tiger and last season’s runners-up Shanghai Shenhua will each lose 10 points and pay a one million yuan ($144,000) fine when the 2026 season begins.Shanghai Port, champions for the past three seasons, and Beijing Guoan will each lose five points and pay a 400,000-yuan fine.","73 people, including former national team coach Li Tie, have been banned for life. 13 professional clubs have been fined for match-fixing and corruption.

NFL refutes $5 million fine as Seahawks ownership pressure resurfaces

For one quiet moment this offseason, the Seattle Seahawks found themselves in the middle of a league-wide controversy that had nothing to do with the field. A report claiming the NFL had fined the franchise $5 million for its ownership structure spread quickly and sparked renewed debate about the team's future.The rumor struck a nerve because it touched a sensitive topic. Seattle has operated under a trust since the death of longtime owner Paul Allen in 2018. With the Seahawks now headed to Super Bowl LX on Feb. 8, 2026, the timing of the claim only made the issue louder and more divisive. Amid all the speculation, the NFL finally addressed the rumor, nearly shutting down the chatter that has broken the internet for quite a while.The claim stated that the NFL had fined the Seattle Seahawks in 2025 for failing to comply with league ownership rules. The story traced back to a report by Wall Street Journal writer Andrew Beaton. While his article cited sources alleging a penalty, it also noted that the league denied issuing any fine.That denial drew more attention when NFL chief spokesman Brian McCarthy responded to Pro Football Talk and said, “As we told the WSJ yesterday on the record, the team was not fined.”McCarthy made the statement during a media follow-up to the original report.Also, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell denied the claim on Monday during his annual pre-Super Bowl conference. He said the report is ""not true.""The league later repeated that stance and said no disciplinary action was taken. Seattle also declined to comment on the alleged fine through Vulcan Inc., the company that manages Paul Allen’s estate.Paul Allen passed away in October 2018. His estate plan transferred control of his assets, including the Seahawks, to his sister Jody Allen. The will stated that the franchise should eventually be sold and that the proceeds would go to charity. However, it did not include a deadline.League pressure reportedly increased in 2024 after a clause in the Lumen Field lease expired. That clause would have required ten per cent of any sale to go to the state of Washington. The NFL prefers a single controlling owner instead of a trust, which creates long-term uncertainty.Despite that discomfort, the Seahawks maintain they are not for sale. Jason Hunke, a Vulcan Inc. spokesperson, told reporters that the team would be sold “eventually in accordance with Paul Allen’s wishes,” but offered no timeline.If a fine had been issued, legal challenges could have followed. Experts note that forcing a sale or applying financial pressure could raise antitrust concerns. For now, no such case exists.Some executives have shown skepticism about prolonged trust ownership and have privately backed the idea of a sale to an individual owner, particularly now that the franchise has surged to prominence with a berth in Super Bowl LX vs. the Patriots on Feb. 8. The facts remain simple. The NFL says no fine exists. Until verified proof appears, the $5 million claim stands as a rumor, not a ruling.","NFL refutes $5 million fine as Seahawks ownership pressure resurfaces.

Davante Adams’ future with the Rams becomes clearer after Sean McVay speaks

The Los Angeles Rams came painfully close to the Super Bowl before falling 31–27 in the NFC Championship Game, a result that immediately shifted focus toward what comes next. A roster built to contend remains largely intact, but the narrow loss has prompted renewed attention on key veterans and how the team plans to move forward in 2026.Much of the league-wide discussion has centered on quarterback Matthew Stafford and whether he will return for another season. At the same time, another important storyline has quietly gained momentum. Davante Adams, who enjoyed a strong rebound year in Los Angeles after a difficult stretch with the New York Jets, quickly became a central figure in the Rams’ offense. His resurgence naturally raised questions about his future with the team.Head coach Sean McVay addressed that uncertainty on Monday with a short but meaningful statement. McVay said he had “no reason to believe” Adams would not be back in 2026. The comment was brief, but it stood out as a strong vote of confidence from a coach who is often measured when discussing roster matters.In 14 regular-season games, Davante Adams caught 60 passes for 789 yards and scored 14 touchdowns. His impact extended beyond statistics, as his presence drew defensive attention and opened opportunities for others.He also delivered in high-pressure moments, adding 11 receptions for 185 yards and a touchdown when the games mattered most.From a financial standpoint, Adams’ contract remains manageable. He signed a two-year, $44 million deal with $26 million fully guaranteed. In 2026, he is scheduled to earn an $18 million salary with a total cap hit of $28 million. While that figure is notable, his production makes a strong case for continuity.The larger uncertainty still surrounds Stafford and whether he will play another season. That decision could influence the Rams’ broader direction. Even so, McVay’s words offered clarity on one key issue. As speculation continues around the roster, Davante Adams appears firmly positioned to remain part of the Rams’ plans heading into 2026.",Davante Adams enjoyed a strong rebound year in Los Angeles after a difficult stretch with the New York Jets.

Tom Brady’s next move is bigger than broadcasting

Tom Brady does not drift. He pivots. When the NFC Championship Game ended on Jan. 26, his FOX season closed. What followed was not rest but movement. A few days later, Brady hinted that another chapter was already taking shape.He did not announce a retirement from TV. He did not walk away from football. Instead, he pointed toward a broader shift. One that moves him further from the booth and deeper into business, ownership, and performance ventures that mirror how he built his career.The first signal came when Tom Brady posted on his Instagram, “Alright, the couch day is over 😂. Heard there’s a big flag football game coming up… 👀.” The post followed FOX’s season wrap and referenced the Fanatics Flag Football Classic, scheduled for March 21, 2026, at Kingdom Arena in Saudi Arabia.Days earlier, he had shared an Instagram story of himself resting on a couch, writing, “So this is what you do on a Sunday 🤔😂💯.” It was a rare pause. It did not last.Brady still holds a 10-year, $375 million contract with FOX, signed in 2022. But his workload now stretches far beyond television. He is a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders. He also serves in an advisory role on football operations, a position Mark Davis has publicly supported.At the same time, Brady continues to expand his off-field portfolio. On Jan. 12, 2026, he announced on Instagram that he joined eMed as its founding Chief Wellness Officer and board member. He explained the move in a video post, saying he wanted to help “improve population health at scale,” and build programs that match the discipline that defined his playing career.That followed another 2025 appointment, when he became Chief Innovation Officer at Aescape, a wellness and recovery technology company focused on muscle longevity.The shift is clear. TB12 is not chasing airtime. He is building platforms tied to health, recovery, and long-term performance. Each move connects to the same theme that carried him through 23 NFL seasons.His involvement with the Raiders has also drawn scrutiny. After Las Vegas finished 3–14 in the 2025 season, Albert Breer said on The Dan Patrick Show in January 2026 that running a team requires a unique skill set than playing. The comment highlighted the growing expectations around Brady’s voice in the franchise.Brady has not responded publicly. Instead, he has kept moving. For now, he remains with FOX. But the signals are consistent. His focus is shifting from the booth to building influence across football, health, and business. Brady is not stepping away from the game. He is stepping into a larger role.","Tom Brady wrapped up his FOX broadcasting season on Jan. 26. A few days later, Brady hinted that another chapter was already taking shape.

Roger Goodell explains why Bad Bunny is the right choice for the NFL Halftime Show as Bad Bunny makes history with a Grammy win

The Super Bowl is never just about football. Every year, it becomes a global stage where sports, music, and culture meet. This time, that spotlight belongs to Bad Bunny . The Puerto Rican superstar will headline the Super Bowl LX halftime show in Santa Clara on Feb. 8, 2026.However, this moment carries more weight than past performances. Bad Bunny arrives at a time when entertainment often crosses into politics. While reactions remain mixed, the NFL believes the show will bring fans together. That belief came directly from commissioner Roger Goodell, who addressed the media days before the biggest game of the year.The NFL made its position clear on Feb 2, 2026. Speaking to reporters in Santa Clara, Roger Goodell said he expects Bad Bunny to use the halftime stage to unite viewers worldwide.“Bad Bunny demonstrated last night that he is one of the great artists of the world, and that is one of the reasons we chose him,” Goodell said during a Super Bowl media event. “But the other reason is he understood the platform he was on, and that this platform is used to unite people.”Goodell referred to Bad Bunny’s Grammy Awards appearance on Feb. 1, where he won Album of the Year for the first Spanish-language album ""Debí Tirar Más Fotos” to earn the honour. During his acceptance speech, the singer said:“We're not savage, we're not animals, we're not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans,"" Bad Bunny said in his Grammy acceptance speech on Feb.1. ""I know it's tough to not hate these days. And I was thinking, sometimes we get contaminated. The hate gets more powerful with more hate.”Soon after, reports confirmed that Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl performance will be entirely in Spanish. It will mark the first time in NFL history that the halftime show features a full Spanish-language set.At the same time, Bad Bunny’s popularity remains unmatched. He has finished as Spotify’s most-streamed artist four times, including in 2025. His music dominates charts across North America, Latin America, and Europe. As a result, the league believes his reach can turn the halftime show into a shared global moment.Still, not everyone supports the choice. When the NFL announced him in November, the right-wing group Turning Point USA announced an alternative “All-American Halftime Show” featuring Kid Rock.Despite the noise, Goodell expressed full confidence in the artist.“I think you’ll have a great performance,” he said.When Super Bowl LX kicks off on Feb. 8 at Levi’s Stadium, millions will tune in for more than the game. For the NFL, Bad Bunny’s halftime show represents a chance to shift the focus from division to connection. Whether fans agree or not, the league believes this moment can still bring the world together, even if only for one night.","Bad Bunny will headline the Super Bowl LX halftime show on Feb. 8, 2026. The Puerto Rican singer won Album of the Year for the first Spanish-language album ""Debí Tirar Más Fotos"" during his Grammy acceptance speech. It will mark the first time in NFL history that the halftime show features a full Spanish- language set.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127874249,imgsize-58630,width-400,resizemode-4/hispanic-super-bowl-halftime-icons-bad-bunny.jpg"

Tony Gonzalez on Travis Kelce’s Retirement Decision



Travis Kelce’s future with the Kansas City Chiefs is one of the most talked-about questions heading into the next NFL season. Retirement rumors have swirled around the 36-year-old tight end, and Tony Gonzalez, NFL legend and former teammate in spirit, offered insight after his Christmas Day interview with Kelce. Gonzalez revealed that the star tight end’s mind is not made up, leaving fans and the franchise in suspense.Kelce himself admitted during the interview, “I really don’t know,” when asked about returning. Gonzalez elaborated on the dilemma, highlighting that Kelce, with three Super Bowl rings and a wedding on the horizon, doesn’t need football for money or fame. The reality check of the Chiefs’ challenges after Patrick Mahomes’ injury also factors into the tight end’s decision.Gonzalez, who spent 17 seasons in the NFL, compared Kelce’s situation to legends like Jerry Rice, who played as long as he needed football. “You get players out there like Jerry Rice,” Gonzalez said. “His advice to me was, 'Play until the wheels fall off.' He is somebody that needed football. I think that's the question Travis has got to ask himself. 'Do I need this, or do I want this?' Because if you want it, I don’t know if that's a strong enough reason.Kelce’s performance last season was solid, with 76 catches for 851 yards and five touchdowns, but not his career peak. Gonzalez reflected on Kelce’s mindset after the Christmas Day conversation: “Even in the interview, I was kind of like, 'Come on, you know a little bit, you got to know something.'” Kelce admitted, “I feel motivated, but I've got to make the right decision for me. I've got to hope that if I do want to come back, the Chiefs are willing to bring me back. It's a two-way street on that.”The Chiefs’ star tight end is clearly weighing his options, balancing personal life and legacy against the demands of the NFL. Gonzalez summarized the core of the uncertainty: ""I think when you want something, it's different than needing it. He doesn't need it, he doesn’t. Why would you come back? That's the question.""For fans, this suspense adds drama to the offseason, leaving the NFL community eager to learn whether Kelce will step back on the field or close this chapter of his illustrious career.","Travis Kelce’s future with the Kansas City Chiefs is one of the most talked- about questions heading into the next NFL season.

Molly Qerim’s bold return to sports broadcasting



Molly Qerim has returned to live sports television with a statement that’s impossible to ignore. The former First Take host dazzled viewers in a bold red outfit during her debut on Zuffa Boxing, proving that her presence on screen remains magnetic. Since leaving ESPN in September, Qerim, 41, has been quietly recharging, but her comeback shows she is stronger and more energized than ever.Her transition from ESPN to Zuffa Boxing is already creating buzz among sports fans. Qerim, who spent nearly two decades at ESPN and hosted First Take since 2015, left amid reports of a surprisingly low salary compared to her co-host Stephen A. Smith. Yet, in her new role alongside Max Kellerman and under UFC icon Dana White, she appears completely in her element.Molly Qerim’s exit from ESPN shocked many, but her reemergence is a showcase of ambition and reinvention. “Beyond excited to host Zuffa Boxing – a sport I’ve loved since Friday Night Fights – and to reconnect with so many longtime friends. Fighter meetings here in Vegas are wrapped, and I feel completely reenergized, ready to pour into this new chapter and help build something special from the ground up. Huge thank you to Dana and Nick for believing in me.Boxing fans – don’t miss Friday night, and if you’re not a boxing fan… check us out, you might become one :). Thank you to everyone who’s reached out since I decided to leave ESPN; the support has meant more than you know. This time off – family, travel, presence – has been such a gift. I’m back 🥊 Much love, MQ.”Her on-air style reflects her renewed confidence. Qerim’s fiery red outfit for the Las Vegas broadcast turned heads, signaling that she is not just back on television but also commanding attention in fashion. Fans have taken notice, recalling her signature ESPN looks, from the “locked in” leather skirts to standout Canadian tuxedos.Qerim’s move also highlights the realities of sports media compensation. At ESPN, her salary reportedly hovered around $500,000, modest compared to Stephen A. Smith’s $20 million contract. While her current earnings remain undisclosed, industry insiders suggest she is being rewarded for her experience and star power.The combination of a fresh platform, high-profile colleagues, and fashion-forward appearances signals that Molly Qerim’s post-ESPN career is off to an impressive start.","Molly Qerim has returned to live sports television with a statement that’s impossible to ignore.

"Why weren’t Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce photographed anywhere during the Grammys after-parties, even after attending it?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-werent-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-photographed-anywhere-during-the-grammys-after-parties-even-after-attending-it/articleshow/127873392.cms,"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce stayed completely out of the spotlight during the 2026 Grammys, skipping the ceremony and all after-parties. With Swift ineligible for nominations this year and both stars keeping a low profile, sources say she is happy, grounded, and focused on life with Kelce while enjoying a rare break from public appearances.

Why Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce chose privacy over Grammys buzz

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce made a deliberate choice to stay invisible on one of music’s loudest nights. While the 2026 Grammy Awards flooded social feeds with red carpet moments and after-party glamour, the superstar couple was nowhere to be seen. No ceremony appearance. No backstage glimpse. No late-night photos. Their absence did not feel accidental. It felt intentional.In recent weeks, both have quietly stepped away from public view. Their last confirmed sighting came in Beverly Hills in mid-January. Since then, silence. No posts. No paparazzi trail. For a couple used to commanding headlines, the decision to disappear during Grammys weekend spoke volumes about where their focus currently lies.There were practical reasons behind the low profile. Taylor Swift had no nominations this year. Her album The Life of a Showgirl arrived on October 3, 2025, missing the eligibility cutoff. It suggests patience rather than retreat. The record will qualify for the 2027 Grammys, leaving the door wide open for a future return.But sources point to something deeper than scheduling. On January 22, Entertainment Tonight quoted an insider saying, “Taylor’s happy, grounded, and fully focused on her life with Travis.Right now, she’s prioritizing everything positive and exciting happening in her life.” That framing places personal stability above public spectacle.Touring is also not on the immediate horizon. In an October interview with BBC Radio 1’s Greg James, Swift addressed speculation head-on. “I am going to be really honest with you,” she said. “I am so tired when I think about doing it [touring] again because I’d want to do it really well again.” The words reflected exhaustion, but also honesty rarely shared at her level of fame.Meanwhile, Travis Kelce continues navigating his own high-pressure career, making shared downtime more valuable than ever.Skipping Grammys night was not about absence. It was about choice. For now, Swift and Kelce appear content building their relationship quietly, away from flashing cameras, letting anticipation build rather than feeding it.","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce stayed out of the spotlight during the 2026 Grammys.

"""Not 1 Black hire"": NFL faces uncomfortable questions as critics highlight ongoing lack of Black head coach and coordinator hires",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/not-1-black-hire-nfl-faces-uncomfortable-questions-as-critics-highlight-ongoing-lack-of-black-head-coach-and-coordinator-hires/articleshow/127873598.cms,"The NFL closed its latest head coaching cycle without hiring a single Black head coach, intensifying scrutiny during Super Bowl Week. Critics, players, reporters, and fans point to a persistent pipeline problem, offensive bias, and systemic barriers. With only three Black head coaches projected for 2026, pressure on league leadership is mounting.

NFL Black head coach hires expose a pipeline problem during Super Bowl Week

The NFL faces renewed scrutiny as its head coaching cycle closes with a glaring outcome. NFL Black head coach hires are again missing from the final list, raising pointed questions about equity, access, and opportunity at the league’s highest coaching level. With all 10 vacancies now believed to be filled, the absence of a single Black head coach has reignited a debate the league has struggled to answer for years.The timing sharpens the focus. Super Bowl Week places league leadership under the brightest possible spotlight, where accountability often meets public pressure. As executives, owners, and media gather in San Francisco, the silence in hiring results speaks louder than any prepared statement. The issue is no longer abstract. It is measurable, current, and impossible to sidestep.Former NFL defensive back Darius Butler captured the frustration spreading across the football world in a blunt assessment: “10 vacancies. Not 1 Black hire. 1 Black OC. We got a pipeline problem!” His words echoed widely because they reflected a pattern, not an anomaly.Washington Post sports enterprise reporter Michael Lee amplified the concern by sharing Jason Murray’s observation: “Ten NFL head coaching openings filled and no Black coaches among them.@PostSports published a terrific project on how tough it is for Black coaches to get these jobs.” The reaction underscored that this is not a social media storm. It is a documented trend backed by reporting and numbers.Fans, too, offered unfiltered perspectives. One noted, “The main issue and this has been covered, teams want offensive based coaches, justifiably as this has been the trend in SB’s for awhile. Currently majority of nfl black coaches are defensive. The trend may change but need more black OC’s.” Another added, “Focus on becoming assistant QB or WR coaches, pass game coordinators, and then offensive coordinators. I know easier said than done but just such a harder path to HC as a defensive coach. The numbers show a clear favoritism.”The questions cut deeper when legacy programs are examined. “Hear me out. Why has there not been any person of color out of Mike Tomlin coaching tree? I think he’s amazing coach. But that’s weird, right?” a fan wrote, pointing to gaps that extend beyond hiring cycles.As projected hires settle in Arizona and Las Vegas, the reality becomes stark. Entering 2026, only Todd Bowles, Aaron Glenn, and DeMeco Ryan remain as Black head coaches in the NFL. That number, in a league dominated by Black players, continues to fuel uncomfortable but necessary conversations.","The NFL closed its latest head coaching cycle without hiring a single Black head coach.

Super Bowl LX: No free stream this year as NBC tightens access to the big game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/super-bowl-lx-no-free-stream-this-year-as-nbc-tightens-access-to-the-big-game/articleshow/127873364.cms,"Super Bowl LX will be harder to watch for free in 2026 as NBC takes over the broadcast. The game airs exclusively on NBC, with Peacock Premium as the only streaming option for cord-cutters. With no free streams or trials available, fans must pay or rely on live TV services to catch the Patriots–Seahawks matchup and Bad Bunny’s halftime show.

Why watching Super Bowl LX is different this year

Super Bowl Sunday is almost here, but for many fans, the excitement comes with an unexpected catch. Watching Super Bowl LX will require a bit more planning than usual. As kickoff approaches, viewers are discovering that this year’s broadcast setup leaves far fewer free options, marking a noticeable shift in how the NFL’s biggest game reaches its audience.The matchup itself promises drama. The New England Patriots face the Seattle Seahawks this Sunday, Feb. 8, with global superstar Bad Bunny set to headline the halftime show. Yet while the on-field and halftime spectacle feels familiar, the way fans tune in does not.Unlike last season, there is no free streaming shortcut. With NBC holding broadcast rights, the game airs exclusively on NBC for traditional viewers. Pregame coverage begins at 1 pm ET, with kickoff locked in for 6:30 pm ET. Anyone without cable or a live TV streaming bundle will need to turn to Peacock, NBC’s streaming platform.That option comes at a cost. Peacock Premium is required to stream the game live, priced at $11 per month or $110 annually. There are no free trials available, closing the door on casual viewers hoping to watch without paying. This contrasts sharply with last year, when Fox made the Super Bowl available for free on its ad-supported platform.For fans who prefer live TV streaming services, there are still choices, though none are cheap. Sling TV’s Blue plan offers the lowest entry point at $46 per month. DirecTV’s MySports Genre Pack starts at $70 per month, while YouTube TV carries NBC at $83 per month, with limited-time discounts for new subscribers.In short, Super Bowl LX remains easy to find but harder to watch for free. NBC and Peacock now sit at the center of the viewing experience, making this year’s game a clear reminder that even America’s biggest sports event is firmly part of the modern streaming era.","Super Bowl LX will be harder to watch for free in 2026 as NBC takes over the broadcast.

Drake Maye vs. Sam Darnold postseason numbers shape Super Bowl LX



Drake Maye vs. Sam Darnold defines the quarterback duel that will decide Super Bowl LX on February 8. Two franchises, New England and Seattle, have arrived here through grit, close calls, and timely execution. What stands out is not pedigree but timing. The league will crown a first-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback, and the margin between these two has been thin all January.This matchup is also about how quickly success can find a passer. Maye is new to the postseason spotlight, yet unafraid of it. Darnold carries more playoff mileage, though not the burden of expectation that once followed him. Both teams know the game will pivot on calm reads, red-zone discipline, and who protects the ball when pressure peaks.Why this contest matters comes down to production under stress. Darnold has logged four playoff games across three teams, with meaningful snaps arriving this season in Seattle. In those appearances, he owns a 103.1 passer rating, 715 yards, five touchdowns, and one interception. The efficiency reflects growth, not volume. Seattle has leaned on him to manage tempo, hit throws off play action, and avoid the mistake that flips a game.Maye’s sample is smaller, but the impact is real. In three playoff games, he has thrown for 533 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions, posting an 84 passer rating. The numbers show a quarterback still learning, yet willing to attack windows. New England has trusted his arm on third down and in late-game drives, even when defenses disguise coverage.How injuries factor in cannot be ignored. Maye appeared as a limited participant on last Wednesday’s report, though the designation came without a full practice and read as caution. Darnold’s situation has drawn more attention. ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reported, “They’ve just been really cautious to make sure he doesn’t let it rip in practice. You know, not be a full go. They want to make sure he’s not trying too much and saving it all for game day. ”When these quarterbacks take the field, past stats will offer context, not answers. Experience may steady Darnold early. Maye’s confidence could fuel a timely strike. The Super Bowl will reward the one who adapts fastest when the script breaks.","Drake Maye vs. Sam Darnold defines the quarterback duel that will decide Super Bowl LX on February 8.

The Traitors

Donna Kelce has never tried to control the spotlight. It seems to find her anyway. As the mother of two NFL icons and the quiet anchor of one of America’s most watched sports families, she has learned how to navigate attention without letting it define her. In a recent candid moment, Donna offered rare insight into how she views the high-profile relationships surrounding her sons, especially as public fascination around Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift continues to grow.Speaking openly during a media appearance, Donna Kelce struck a tone that was warm, grounded, and unmistakably proud. Her comments reflected not only her admiration for Swift but also her belief that her children surround themselves with the right people, even under intense scrutiny.Donna’s words carried the kind of reassurance fans rarely hear from someone so close to the center of celebrity culture. After sharing a clip from her appearance onon Facebook, she responded to comments about Taylor Swift and Kylie Kelce with a line that resonated far beyond the post.“My kids seem to befriend and love the very best of society... lucky me.” The quote was brief, but it spoke volumes about trust, pride, and perspective.Her respect for boundaries also stood out. Kylie Kelce, wife of Jason Kelce, has praised Donna for keeping details from reality television private. That mutual respect has become a quiet strength within the family, allowing relationships to grow without being shaped by gossip.Donna also revealed she had seen parts of her sons’ pasts while filming, including people she would rather not encounter again. “Maybe some of my sons' adversaries. That could either be on other teams,” she said. “Or it could be coaches or it could be past girlfriends.” The honesty landed without bitterness, reinforcing her grounded nature.Moments like Donna strolling arm in arm with Andrea Swift at Sundance further fueled public curiosity, yet the relaxed scene suggested calm rather than conflict.As wedding rumors swirl around Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, Donna remains steady. She does not fan speculation. She lets actions speak. In a world driven by noise, that quiet confidence might be her greatest statement.",Donna Kelce spoke openly during a media appearance.

While some defended his self expression, others criticized the timing and focus. A viral tweet escalated the backlash, turning Diggs’ fashion choice into a wider debate about professionalism, image, and distractions during the biggest week of the NFL season.

Stefon Diggs draws heat as bold Super Bowl week outfit divides fans

Super Bowl week barely started, and Stefon Diggs already managed to ignite a firestorm. As the New England Patriots arrived in California ahead of Super Bowl LX, most players blended into standard team gear. Diggs did the opposite. His bold winter style turned a routine arrival into a viral moment within minutes.Fans did not just react. They exploded. Social media lit up as Diggs stepped off the team charter wearing a fuzzy coat, heavy boots, and ripped jeans that clashed sharply with the rest of the roster. For some, it was classic Diggs. For others, it crossed a line during the most serious week of the season.The criticism escalated quickly. One fan reply aimed directly at the wide receiver spread fast, drawing attention far beyond fashion debates. The tweet read: “Appropriate attire for someone who knocked up four women in the last twelve months, coward.” The post fueled backlash, turning Diggs’ outfit into a lightning rod for deeper frustrations about his public image.The response divided the supporters of Patriots into two groups. The fans justified the right of Diggs to express himself by referring to his performance on the field and the emotional reaction to the victory in the AFC Championship.This is because, critics said that Super Bowl week requires emphasis rather than spectacle. They considered the appearance as a dramatic unnecessary moment at the most unopportune moment.Diggs has never been shy about standing out. That reputation followed him into New England, where doubts about his fit lingered early in the season. Still, the Patriots got results. He delivered a 1,000 yard campaign and played a key role in their title run. None of that stopped fans from questioning whether his off field presence distracts from the mission.As kickoff approaches, the controversy shows no sign of fading. Diggs’ outfit may fade from headlines, but the reaction around it reveals something bigger. During Super Bowl week, every move is magnified. For better or worse, Diggs once again proved that he knows how to command attention.","Stefon Diggs sparked controversy as the Patriots arrived for Super Bowl week after his bold outfit drew intense fan reactions online.

Ann Michael Maye is making headlines as Super Bowl week arrives, blending fitness, fandom, and star power as New England prepares for its biggest night. With the Patriots set to face the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl 60, Maye marked the moment publicly, sharing a snapshot that captured both the mood of the week and her growing cultural presence around the team.The image, posted to her Instagram Story on Monday, showed Maye seated on a pilates reformer in a gray sports bra and matching leggings, her toned physique drawing instant attention. She captioned it, “Happy Super Bowl week!!! 🤍🤍“ The timing mattered. New England had just arrived in Santa Clara, where the Patriots will wear all white as the designated home team, while Seattle lines up in all college navy.The post was more than a fitness check in. It reflected how closely Ann Michael Maye has become woven into the Patriots’ Super Bowl narrative. She was present at the team’s send off rally at Gillette Stadium on Sunday, later sharing moments from the event on TikTok. A week earlier, she traveled to Denver to support Drake Maye during New England’s gritty 10 to 7 AFC Championship win over the Broncos.Her visibility has followed the quarterback’s breakout season. Drake Maye’s rise into MVP conversations pushed the Patriots back into the Super Bowl for the first time since 2019, and Ann’s profile rose alongside it.Fans in Foxborough quickly embraced her during the 2025 regular season, where her posts felt personal rather than polished, building a loyal following that now stands at 512,000 on TikTok.That audience first came for her baking. Ann became a viral hit through her “Bakemas” holiday series, which later opened the door to a bigger opportunity. Earlier this month, she announced “Beyond Bakemas,” a new show with NBC Sports Boston. The debut episode featured Barstool Sports founder and longtime Patriots fan Dave Portnoy, signaling her smooth crossover from social media to regional sports media. Represented by Creative Artists Agency, her brand now stretches well beyond the sidelines.Through it all, her support for Drake Maye has remained constant. She stood by him on draft night in 2024 when New England selected him third overall, a moment that capped a journey that began long before the NFL. The couple have been together since they were 12 years old and attended UNC together, a rare continuity in a league defined by change.Whether or not they attend NFL Honors later this week remains unclear.

A few seconds during the broadcast can define a film’s entire marketing run, turning curiosity into instant conversation.This year’s matchup between New England and Seattle at Levi’s Stadium has studios lining up early. The reason is simple. “In 2026, a 30-second Super Bowl commercial costs around $10 million, making it the most expensive ad slot on television, according to reports by Deadline.” Only the most confident projects earn that investment.Among the confirmed heavy hitters is Minions 3, which is gearing up for a July release. Universal and Illumination are expected to lean into broad humor and family appeal, using the Super Bowl to lock in summer audiences early.Another major presence is Michael. Lionsgate plans to unveil a powerful first look at the biopic starring Jaafar Jackson. Directed by Antoine Fuqua, the film’s Super Bowl debut signals confidence in its global reach.Disney is also expected to command attention with The Mandalorian and Grogu and Toy Story 5, both positioned as event releases designed to span generations. Paramount’s Scream 7 could use the moment to remind fans that its release is right around the corner.Speculation remains strong around Avengers: Doomsday, which may offer a brief tease rather than a full trailer. Sony and Marvel could also surprise audiences with Spider-Man: Brand New Day.Sci fi fans are watching closely for Disclosure Day, while DC Studios may preview its future with Supergirl. Together, these previews could make Super Bowl LX one of the most cinematic Sundays in recent memory.Beyond touchdowns and halftime buzz, Super Bowl LX remains the rare moment when Hollywood speaks to everyone at once. These trailers are not just ads. They are statements of confidence, scale, and ambition. Whether confirmed or still rumored, each studio is chasing the same outcome: instant cultural impact. When the final whistle blows, some films will already have won their opening weekend.","Super Bowl LX is shaping up to be a major night for Hollywood. Confirmed films like Minions 3, Michael, and Toy Story 5 are set to appear. Marvel, DC, and Star Wars projects are also expected to tease audiences during television’s most watched event.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127860576,imgsize-103268,width-400,resizemode-4/127860576.jpg"
NBA insider delivers jaw-dropping update on LeBron James’ future with Lakers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/nba-insider-delivers-jaw-dropping-update-on-lebron-james-future-with-lakers/articleshow/127875311.cms,"LeBron James. Image via: Getty Images

LeBron James and the Lakers are reportedly moving on



Why the Lakers might let LeBron James go



It is quite fair to assume that LeBron James is ready to hang up his basketball sneakers. While nothing about his retirement is confirmed as of yet, the Lakers veteran has made plenty of cryptic gestures signaling towards ending his legendary NBA career. But if he decides to play another season, it might not be with the Lakers.In its essence, it is important to note that James is still in his A-game with a steady production at 41. However, following recent reports of a clash with the Lakers organization (although everyone involved denied it), a new bombshell update from NBA insider Jake Fischer revealed that he and the organization are ready to move on.Is it the end of LeBron James’ Lakers era? It appears so, at least considering recent updates surrounding the NBA icon and his relationship with the franchise. James may not wear the purple and gold for another season.Amid James’ uncertain future, NBA insider Jake Fischer gives a jaw-dropping update revealing that James is ready to move on from the Lakers.“The Lakers are ready to move on from LeBron James and I think LeBron James is ready to move on from the Lakers as well,” Fischer shared on his YouTube show.He added, “That’s kind of the foregone sentiment in Los Angeles right now about what’s to come this summer.”Of course, as Fischer stated, it would make sense for the franchise from a business point of view. Since the blockbuster Luka Doncic trade, the intention of the Lakers was quite clear. They are building a young roster centered on Doncic and, of course, Austin Reaves.It is not a secret that James is quite expensive to keep, and considering his age factor, it does not make sense for the franchise. Of course, he is in his elite form, averaging 21.9 points per game, 5.8 rebounds, and 6.6 assists. However, it all comes down to the age factor, and the Lakers are looking to build their roster for the long term.Since Doncic’s trade, the Lakers have already shifted their attention to the Slovenian star to lead the team. Later, James exercised his $52.6 million player option for the current season. After the 2025-26 season, James will be an unrestricted free agent if he decides to remain in the league.Further, recent reports indicated that James had a rift with the Lakers' governor, Jeanie Buss. While Buss discarded the claims, James said that he ""doesn't care"" what anyone thinks about him. So, considering all those factors, it is fair to assume that Fischer’s report has gravity, and it is a hint of the end of his Lakers tenure.",LeBron James may not wear the purple and gold for another season.

What’s going on with Terry Rozier? Heat star’s NBA dispute explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/whats-going-on-with-terry-rozier-heat-stars-nba-dispute-explained/articleshow/127874318.cms,"Terry Rozier. Image via: Rick Osentoski-Imagn Images

Heat guard Terry Rozier wins dispute with the NBA



What sparked the dispute between Terry Rozier and the NBA?



Is the dispute between Terry Rozier and the NBA resolved?



The Miami Heat finally received clarity on Terry Rozier’s contract situation. It has ended months of uncertainty tied to the ongoing legal case. An arbitrator ruled in Rozier’s favor, allowing the veteran guard to collect his full salary for the 2025–26 season despite his absence from the team. The decision was significant to the financial prospects for both Rozier and the franchise, especially with the approaching trade deadline.Rozier’s pay had been held in escrow since December, even though his $26.6 million salary became fully guaranteed in January. The ruling finally removes a cloud that had followed Miami’s roster planning all season.An arbitrator determined that Terry Rozier is entitled to receive his full salary, siding with both the player and the National Basketball Players Association. ESPN’s David Purdum first broke the news, confirming that Rozier’s paychecks, which had been placed into an interest-bearing account, must now be released.“Terry won today under principles of contract law and the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the league and the players, but the bigger principle at issue is the presumption of innocence,” Jim Trusty, Rozier’s attorney, said in a statement, according to Purdum.“Today’s arbitration ruling reminds the NBA that they can’t ignore that important concept just because it’s a high-profile case.”The NBPA aligned with the stance after the ruling. “We are pleased with the arbitrator’s ruling and remain committed to ensuring Terry’s due process rights are protected and that he is afforded the presumption of innocence throughout this process,” the union said in a statement released to ESPN.From a cap perspective, the decision changes little for Miami. Rozier’s salary already counted against the Heat’s books.The conflict traces back to Rozier’s arrest in late October, following allegations tied to a federal gambling investigation. Prosecutors accused Rozier of conspiring with associates to influence bets placed on a March 23, 2023 game, when he played for the Charlotte Hornets. Gamblers who wagered on his statistical totals finishing under reportedly won.Rozier has pleaded not guilty to wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy charges. His legal team has asked for the case to be dismissed, arguing federal overreach. The NBA previously reviewed unusual betting activity flagged by sportsbooks and did not find sufficient evidence to discipline him, noting that Rozier cooperated fully with the league’s probe.The Heat acquired Rozier from Charlotte in January 2024, unaware of any potential federal charges at the time.From a labor standpoint, yes. The arbitration ruling settles the salary dispute and confirms Rozier will earn the full $26.6 million owed this season. His contract expires at the end of the year, positioning him as an unrestricted free agent heading into his age-32 season.The decision also restores flexibility for Miami ahead of the Feb. 5 trade deadline. Rozier’s expiring contract now stands as a usable asset, while the Heat retains the option to let it expire and open future cap space.","Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier has won his dispute with the NBA.

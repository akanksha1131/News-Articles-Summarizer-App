AHMEDABAD: In a battle of ‘Impact Players,’ Punjab Kings ’ Vijaykumar Vyshak bowled two tight overs, denying Gujarat Titans’ Sherfane Rutherford the ideal length to extend his arms, while left-arm pacer Marco Jansen dismissed Jos Buttler (54 off 33 balls) in the 18th over to derail Titans’ spirited chase of 244 and help the visitors claim an 11-run win here on Tuesday.The hero of the day was Punjab captain Shreyas Iyer (97* off 42 balls), who led from the front with a belligerent unbeaten knock as the visitors posted 243/5. Iyer was ably supported by meaningful contributions from middle-order batter Shashank Singh (44* off 16 balls) and opener Priyansh Arya (47 off 23 balls) as the Kings commenced their quest for a maiden IPL title by posting a huge total.Titans' captain Shubman Gill and Sai Sudharsan (74 off 41 balls) subsequently got the hosts off to a swift 61-run opening stand before Gill was dismissed. Buttler and Sudharsan then added 84 runs in 40 balls to put the Titans back on track.After Sudharsan’s dismissal, Rutherford smashed 18 off his first seven balls to reduce the target to 75 off 36 balls. Vyshak, though, despite bowling wides, bowled fast and outside off to stymie Rutherford. The West Indian batter’s inability to rotate the strike also increased the pressure on Buttler, who was bowled by Jansen.Left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh castled Rutherford (46 off 28 balls) in the last over to seal Gujarat’s fate.Earlier, when Punjab batted, southpaw Priyansh Arya gave ample demonstration of the potential he holds at this level with a chancy yet breezy knock. Iyer came in early, after the dismissal of Prabhsimran Singh, who was caught at third man by Arshad Khan off Kagiso Rabada’s bowling.Arya, meanwhile, flicked Mohammed Siraj over deep square leg for a six before smashing a flurry of boundaries off left-arm pacer Arshad Khan’s bowling in the fifth over. Leg-spinner Rashid Khan ended Arya’s knock after the latter scooped a delivery to Sai Sudharsan at cover.His dismissal brought in former Titan Azmatullah Omarzai, who greeted Khan with a six straight over his head.Marcus Stoinis and Iyer added 57 for the fifth wicket before a reverse sweep led to Stoinis’s downfall. Thereafter, it was the Shashank-Iyer show. The duo clobbered 87 runs off the last five overs to take the Kings to the highest total scored on this ground.Iyer’s strong start to the season is good news for the batter and for Punjab. His reunion with coach Ricky Ponting at the franchise might just galvanise the outfit into providing stronger and more consistent performances this season, something they have lacked at crunch times in recent seasons.",Punjab Kings beat Gujarat Titans by 11 runs. Shreyas Iyer top scored with 97 not out. Shashank Singh (44) and Priyansh Arya (47) also made centuries. Gujarat were bowled out for 244 in their 50 overs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119510829,imgsize-41636,width-400,resizemode-4/119510829.jpg"

GUWAHATI: Having found themselves in a similar situation after suffering defeats in their respective opening matches, it will be interesting to see which team feels more at home here on Wednesday as Rajasthan Royals (RR) take on Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) at the Assam Cricket Association Stadium.While the Knights suffered a seven-wicket loss to Royal Challengers Bengaluru at home, the Royals went down to Sunrisers Hyderabad by 44 runs. Though it’s too early to be worried at the start of such a long season, both sides will be hoping to turn things around at the earliest.“It’s always good to win the first game, but there are some lessons to be learnt from there. We could have capitalised (on the start); we could have got more runs, but we lost wickets towards the end of the innings. Whatever you do, there is always an opportunity to bowl better,” KKR bowling coach Bharat Arun said on Tuesday.Though the Knights are the away team here, the former India bowling coach is hoping to get some home comfort over the Royals. The Jaipur-based franchise uses the Barsapara stadium as their second home ground in addition to their base at Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur.“Guwahati is a short distance from Kolkata, (many people) speak the same language here, so it’s a second home for us,” Arun said with a cheeky smile. But Riyan Parag, the Royals' skipper for the first three games, begged to differ.“I’m not sure how many Bengalis are there in KKR (there are none), but being an Assamese I hope I’ll get more support over here,” the 23-year-old Parag said.Both sides must make some corrections if they want to come back to winning ways.Rajasthan’s bowlers gave away too many runs to the Hyderabad batters, led by Ishan Kishan — who scored a ton — and opener Travis Head. The Knights, on the other hand, will hope that Rinku comes back into the groove and Varun Chakravarthy weaves a web with his mystery spin.","Rajasthan Royals take on Kolkata Knight Riders at Assam Cricket Association Stadium.

LSG in IPL 2025: Rishabh Pant to lead Lucknow Super Giants in bid for first title

In a thrilling IPL 2025 match in Visakhapatnam, Lucknow Super Giants captain Rishabh Pant remained composed about a crucial missed stumping opportunity against Delhi Capitals .Ashutosh Sharma emerged as DC's hero with an unbeaten 66, leading his team to victory when the odds were against them. In the final over, with six runs needed from six balls, Pant chose Shahbaz Ahmed to bowl.The first ball of the final over saw Mohit Sharma step down the track and miss, with Pant failing to complete the stumping. Although Pant opted for a DRS review for LBW, the ball was shown to have missed the stumps.Mohit managed a single, bringing Ashutosh on strike. The 26-year-old then sealed the match with a six over Shahbaz's head, securing a one-wicket victory for Delhi Capitals.""Definitely, luck plays a part in this game, and if it could have missed his (Mohit Sharma's) pads, it was a chance for stumping. But these things happen in the game of cricket. You can't focus on these things, but rather, you need to play better cricket.""After winning the toss and choosing to field, DC faced a strong batting display from LSG. Mitchell Marsh scored 72 while Nicholas Pooran contributed 75, helping their team post a total above 200 runs.""I think our top-order batters played really well, and I think it was a pretty good score on this wicket. As a team, we are looking to take positives from every match, and as a team, we are looking to learn from it (every match.) The more basics we do right, the more it is going to be better for us in the future. We got early wickets, but we knew it was a good wicket to bat on. We had to keep doing the basics right more often than not.""DC's chase began poorly as they struggled at 65/5 in the seventh over. However, several crucial partnerships turned the game around.The partnerships included a 55-run stand between Ashutosh and Vipraj Nigam (39), 45 runs between Tristan Stubbs and Ashutosh, and 43 runs between Axar Patel and Faf du Plessis.""I think they had a couple of good partnerships. One with Stubbs, one with Ashutosh and one with one other guy (Vipraj Nigam.) I think he (Nigam) did a pretty good job and took the game away from us. There was enough for the bowlers, but I think we could have done the basics right. We felt the pressure, we are still settling in, but a lot of positives to take from this match.""",Delhi Capitals beat Lucknow Super Giants by one wicket in IPL 2025 match.

LSG in IPL 2025: Rishabh Pant to lead Lucknow Super Giants in bid for first title

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

Lucknow Super Giants owner Sanjiv Goenka met with Rishabh Pant for a discussion following Lucknow Super Giants' defeat to Delhi Capitals in their IPL 2025 opening match. Goenka-owned LSG had acquired Pant for a record sum of Rs 27 crore during the mega auction.LSG had DC struggling at 113 for six while defending 210 runs but couldn't secure the victory. Ashutosh Sharma's outstanding performance of 66 not out from 31 balls guided DC to victory with one wicket and three balls remaining in Visakhapatnam.Pant's debut as LSG captain was underwhelming across all aspects of the game. He scored a duck from six balls, falling to Kuldeep Yadav, in a high-scoring match where five batters achieved strike rates above 200.His leadership decisions were questioned, particularly regarding Shardul Thakur's limited use. Despite taking two wickets in his first over, Thakur only bowled two overs in total.With 22 runs needed from the final two overs, Pant chose inexperienced Prince Yadav over Shardul. Prince conceded 16 runs, including two fours and a six.In the last over, with just a run per ball required, Pant opted for left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed instead of the experienced Shardul, who has previously secured victories for India in similar situations.A crucial stumping opportunity was missed by Pant in the final over. Though Shahbaz beat Mohit Sharma with an excellent delivery, Pant failed to collect the ball after it deflected off Mohit's back pad.""Definitely luck plays a part in this game and if it could have missed his (Mohit Sharma's) pads, it was a chance for stumping. But these things happen in the game of cricket, you can't focus on these things, but rather you need to play better cricket,"" Pant stated during the post-match presentation.Following the match, Goenka seemingly had a conversation with Pant and coach Justin Langer. While less intense than his previous discussion with former captain KL Rahul in IPL 2024, it served as a subtle reminder for Pant to improve his performance.Delhi's chase began poorly at 7-3 in the second over. The situation worsened when they lost five wickets for 65 runs, including Faf du Plessis who scored 29 in his first match for the team.DC captain Axar Patel contributed 22 runs quickly, while Tristan Stubbs added 34 to the chase.",Lucknow Super Giants owner Sanjiv Goenka met with Rishabh Pant following their defeat to Delhi Capitals in their IPL 2025 opening match.

'It was for all the supporters': Ishan Kishan on animated celebration after scoring hundred

NEW DELHI: Ashutosh Sharma stood firm, kept his composure, and unleashed his batting firepower when it mattered the most, guiding Delhi Capitals to a thrilling last-over victory against Lucknow Super Giants in their IPL 2025 opener at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium in Visakhapatnam.The young batter roared in celebration, swinging his bat and gesturing animatedly toward the Delhi Capitals dugout after sealing a breathtaking chase.Ashutosh was the hero of the night, smashing an unbeaten 66 off just 31 balls, rescuing his side from the brink of defeat and steering them to a stunning one-wicket win.Earlier, Lucknow Super Giants put up a formidable total of 209/8 in 20 overs, powered by Mitchell Marsh ’s explosive 72 off 36 balls and Nicholas Pooran ’s blistering 75 off 30. Despite their efforts, LSG couldn't keep Ashutosh from scripting a memorable turnaround.Delhi Capitals’ chase got off to a nightmare start as they crumbled to 7/3 within two overs, with Shardul Thakur and Manimaran Siddharth wreaking havoc. Jake Fraser-McGurk, Abishek Porel, and Sameer Rizvi fell cheaply, putting DC on the back foot.Captain Axar Patel (22 off 11) and Faf du Plessis (29 off 18) tried to rebuild, but DC still found themselves struggling at 113/6 in the 13th over, requiring 97 runs off just 45 balls.That’s when Ashutosh turned the game on its head.Displaying a perfect balance of composure and controlled aggression, he took on the LSG bowlers fearlessly, dispatching five boundaries and five towering sixes. His calculated counterattack kept DC alive in the chase.Vipraj Nigam provided vital support with a quickfire 39 off 15 balls, building a game-changing partnership with Ashutosh that reignited Delhi’s hopes.With 18 runs needed off the last two overs, Ashutosh kept his nerve, expertly maneuvering the strike and punishing loose deliveries. Despite losing Kuldeep Yadav in the penultimate over, he remained unfazed.Then, with just a few runs required, Ashutosh finished things off in style—launching a stunning straight six off the third ball of the final over, sealing an unforgettable win for Delhi Capitals and etching his name as the hero of the night.","Delhi Capitals beat Lucknow Super Giants by one wicket in their IPL 2025 opener.

NEW DELHI: In a touching moment that won hearts, young left-arm wrist spinner Vignesh Puthur bowed down to touch Nita Ambani 's feet after receiving the 'Best Bowler' award from the Mumbai Indians (MI) franchise owner. The gesture, reflecting his humility and gratitude, took place in the MI dressing room following the team's defeat to Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in their IPL 2025 season opener.Chasing a modest target of 156, CSK were cruising despite the early dismissal of opener Rahul Tripathi in the second over. Skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad and Rachin Ravindra stitched a quickfire 67-run partnership off just 6.1 overs, with Gaikwad notching up his fastest IPL fifty in just 22 balls.However, Vignesh Puthur, making his IPL debut, turned the game on its head with a sensational spell. Despite never having played state cricket before, the 24-year-old spinner made his presence felt by dismissing three seasoned Indian internationals — Ruturaj Gaikwad, Shivam Dube and Deepak Hooda — reducing CSK from 78/1 to 107/4 in the 12th over. Vignesh finished with impressive figures of 3 for 32 in his four-over spell.Though CSK ultimately secured victory with five balls to spare and four wickets in hand, thanks to Rachin Ravindra's match-winning knock of 65 not out from 45 balls, Vignesh's valiant effort became the talking point.WATCH:After receiving MI's 'Best Bowler' award from Nita Ambani, Vignesh humbly expressed his gratitude, saying, ""I want to thank the MI franchise for giving me the opportunity to play the match.

His explosive knock powered Sunrisers Hyderabad to a commanding 44-run victory over Rajasthan Royals.However, Kishan’s journey to this moment is even more compelling than his stunning century on debut for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL.Around this time last year, he was dropped from the BCCI’s central contracts, with selectors and top officials believing he wasn’t prioritising red-ball cricket.Once regarded as one of India’s top three wicketkeeper-batters alongside Rishabh Pant and Sanju Samson, Kishan found himself on the sidelines, left to reflect and rebuild.But on Sunday, in the vibrant Orange jersey, he let his bat do the talking. His unbeaten 47-ball innings, laced with 11 boundaries and six sixes, was a statement of intent.As he reached his century, Kishan, who was bought for Rs 11.25 crore at the auction, celebratory roar sent a clear message—he was back.Former England captain Michael Vaughan believes Kishan’s fiery celebration was directed at India’s selectors and captain Rohit Sharma “Kishan’s celebration for three figures today, that was a celebration maybe (aimed) for Mumbai, maybe to the chairman of selectors, maybe to Rohit Sharma, maybe to the whole of India, maybe to the whole of the world, just to say, ‘Look I’m a decent player’,"" Vaughan told Cricbuzz.""He’s a wonderfully balanced player, with the break of the wrist to just flick the ball. He’s got that great shot on the onside with anything short. I’d love to be the chairman of selectors for India. I mean, the selection meetings would be long because you’ve got so many players to talk about and you’d be a naughty step as a selector because you’re saying to someone ‘sorry, you’re not even in the top five at the minute’,"" he said.""The talent pool in Indian cricket is monstrous and the only way that you can get in, the only way that you can push yourself into that set-up is by doing remarkable things. I think of all the formats to get a century in, T20 cricket is the hardest format to get in,” Vaughan said.After a dominant win against Rajasthan Royals, Sunrisers Hyderabad will next face Lucknow Super Giants on Thursday at the same venue.",Ishan Kishan scored 106 off just 47 balls in Sunrisers Hyderabad's IPL win. The wicketkeeper-batsman was dropped by the BCCI around this time last year.

'You don’t get more pressure than playing for India': Glenn Phillips on Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: Shreyas Iyer ’s captaincy stint with Punjab Kings began in the perfect fashion, as he led his team to a thrilling 11-run victory over Gujarat Titans in their IPL 2025 clash at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. His commanding unbeaten 97 with the bat and astute leadership helped Punjab Kings secure a high-scoring win in a nail-biting contest.Stepping onto the field in Punjab Kings’ red for the first time, Iyer exuded confidence at the toss, admitting he would have chosen to field as well. Despite losing the toss, he made his mark with the bat, guiding Punjab to a formidable total of 243/5.Though he missed out on what would have been a well-deserved century, Iyer’s knock was widely applauded. As he walked back unbeaten on 97, the smile on his face spoke volumes — his primary focus was on helping Punjab Kings, a team still chasing their maiden IPL title since the tournament’s inception in 2008.At the end of the 19th over, Iyer was on 97*, with Shashank Singh at the other end on 22 off 10 balls. Prioritising the team’s success over personal milestones, Iyer approached Shashank before the final over and urged him to focus solely on maximising runs. Shashank delivered, smashing five boundaries off Mohammed Siraj’s over to push Punjab Kings to a massive total.In response, Gujarat Titans fought valiantly but fell short, finishing at 232/5 despite impressive contributions from Sai Sudharsan (74), Shubman Gill (33), and Jos Buttler (54). Sherfane Rutherford’s explosive 46 provided late hope, but the target proved too steep.For his selfless 97* and match-winning leadership, Iyer was named the Player of the Match, setting the tone for Punjab Kings’ campaign in IPL 2025.""Getting 97 not out in the first match and that too in the opening game of the season for us is the icing on the cake. I got a four the first ball I faced and it got me going. That flick six off Rabada as well. 44 runs he scored off 16-17 off balls was pretty crucial for the team. We set a benchmark that we had to go for it. With the dew coming it things could change and thankfully he performed. He is a funny character. He has got traits in him where he comes in with the right attitude. Kept his calm and composure,"" Iyer said.""Arshdeep played an important role in that. He came in and said the ball is actually reversing a bit so the Saliva on the ball is helping the bowlers. He got Sai and it helped us. Before the season started we left no stone unturned. Everyone chipped in with what we can execute on the field and it wasn't just me talking. We look to carry forward the momentum into the other games as well,"" he said.Punjab Kings will next face Lucknow Super Giants on April 1 at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow.",Punjab Kings beat Gujarat Titans by 11 runs in IPL 2025 opener.

NEW DELHI: The toss proceedings at the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 continue to produce lighthearted moments, with former India cricketer and coach Ravi Shastri 's slip of tongue during the Gujarat Titans vs Punjab Kings match at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad becoming the latest talking point.Shastri, the toss presenter, mistakenly asked Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer to spin the coin instead of Gujarat Titans skipper Shubman Gill , despite the match being held at GT's home ground. The unexpected request left Iyer visibly puzzled as he questioned, ""I will spin the coin?"" before Shastri quickly corrected himself and handed over the responsibility to Gill.With the confusion cleared, Gill spun the coin, and Iyer called ""tails."" However, the toss landed in GT's favour with ""heads,"" and the home captain chose to field first.After winning the toss, Gill explained his decision, citing the influence of dew in Ahmedabad. ""We will bowl first. It is a good cricketing wicket. There is some dew here, and big targets can be chased down. Preparation has been amazing, and we have our bases covered with a solid bowling attack,"" Gill said.Iyer, on the other hand, admitted that he would have opted to bowl first as well but remained optimistic about batting first. ""I love a chase, but we are up for the challenge. We have so many familiar faces around, including Ricky (Ponting). Our team is well-balanced with all-rounders, and we are spoiled for choices,"" Iyer remarked.The moment added to the entertaining nature of the IPL, which had already witnessed a humorous toss exchange between Rishabh Pant and Axar Patel the previous night.","Ravi Shastri mistakenly asks Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer to spin the coin instead of Gujarat Titans skipper Shubman Gill.

KKR in IPL 2025: Kolkata Knight Riders seek successful title defence

'RCB bowled really well in the powerplay': Ajinkya Rahane

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders ' (KKR) bowling coach Bharat Arun remains optimistic despite their opening match loss in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 season. As KKR prepares to face Rajasthan Royals in Guwahati on Wednesday, Arun emphasised that the team is not overly concerned about their defeat against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and is focused on bouncing back.Both KKR and Rajasthan Royals enter the match on the back of losses, with KKR suffering a seven-wicket defeat to RCB and Royals falling to Sunrisers Hyderabad by 44 runs. Speaking to the media on Tuesday, Arun highlighted the positives from KKR’s first game while acknowledging areas for improvement.""As a team, we are not too worried about it. It's always good to win the first match, you gain the momentum. But there were a lot of positives from the first game, some lessons to be learnt from there,"" Arun said.Addressing concerns over KKR's batting performance, particularly the modest contributions of star players Andre Russell and Rinku Singh , Arun remained confident in their abilities.""Sport is about failing. You fail more often, then you succeed. Champions like Russell must have it weighing on their minds when they fail, but they are always out to prove themselves. We are hoping he will really come good in tomorrow's game,"" he stated.Arun also backed Rinku Singh, citing his strong performances in pre-tournament matches.Commenting on the competitive balance in the IPL, Arun observed, ""Every team is batting well, getting and chasing 250-plus scores. You can't say this team is better than the other. Every team is evenly balanced, both in batting and bowling.""He stressed the importance of seizing crucial moments in matches. ""Teams that snatch those crucial moments at any given point of time are going to win. How challenged you are to seize those key moments is what matters.""On KKR’s strategic approach, Arun emphasised a team-oriented mindset. ""All teams have some really fantastic batters. There is no point in targeting one player; we have to look at the whole team and devise a strategy accordingly. Our game plan is to win.""Regarding the match venue, the Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati, Arun expressed optimism about the playing conditions. ""We have not had a look at the wicket yet, but it seems good. The conditions are excellent, and the outfield looks really good for us. We hope to have a very good contest,"" he concluded.",Bharat Arun remains optimistic despite Kolkata Knight Riders' defeat to Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) KKR face Rajasthan Royals in Guwahati on Wednesday.

'It was for all the supporters': Ishan Kishan on animated celebration after scoring hundred

NEW DELHI: He came, he saw, and he conquered — that’s how Ashutosh Sharma kept fans on the edge of their seats in a nail-biting last-over finish against Lucknow Super Giants in Visakhapatnam. Coming in as an Impact Player at No. 7, Ashutosh remained calm under pressure and delivered the most defining knock of his IPL career, guiding Delhi Capitals to a thrilling one-wicket victory.Bought by Delhi Capitals for Rs 3.8 crore in the IPL 2025 Mega Auction, Ashutosh stepped up when his team was in deep trouble — reeling at 7/3 before slipping further to 113/6. Alongside Vipraj Nigam (39 off 15 balls), they stitched a crucial 55-run stand in quick time. Despite wickets tumbling at the other end, the Railways batter held his ground and sealed the chase in style. Ashutosh remained unbeaten on 66 off just 31 balls, finishing the game with a massive six off Shahbaz Ahmed as Delhi Capitals successfully hunted down a 210-run target with three balls to spare. His explosive knock featured five fours and five sixes.His childhood coach and former India cricketer Amay Khurasiya believes that if DC, still in pursuit of their maiden IPL title, want to turn their fortunes around, they must promote the in-form Ashutosh to open the innings.""He has always had a lot of resilience. He can absorb pressure, something he has done in the past—not just in the IPL but in other games and in life as well. He is a determined player, always striving to improve his game. If Delhi wants to win their maiden title, they must send him to open the innings and dominate the Powerplay. He is the most difficult player to handle and stop in the Powerplay. Axar should try him. He is a nightmare for bowlers,"" Khurasiya told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""Ashutosh can hook the ball. He can hook it off the front foot. He can pull off the front foot. And he does it against bowlers clocking 140 kmph. He can play the backfoot punch. He can cut. He has all the shots in the book. Plus, he has innovated so many others,"" he said.""He must play for India. Can you believe a batter turned the game around when his team was struggling at 113 for 6? How many players have done that? On a track where the ball was holding up, he took on Ravi Bishnoi—an India international and one of the country’s best spinners. And that too, on a challenging pitch. This guy should be playing for India in T20s. He should be a straight pick. An amazing talent. You need to identify such players early and not make them wait.""Let me tell you something—he is not just a batter but also an outstanding fielder. Very few people know that he is also a skilled wicketkeeper and a medium pacer. He can keep wickets, he can open the innings, and he can bowl fast. Believe me, he is one of the finest wicketkeepers. He did both—keeping and bowling—while playing junior cricket for MP. He started his career as a wicketkeeper and an opening batsman. This guy needs to be nurtured. You need to take care of such talent. He is a match-winner,"" he said.Ashutosh has been a student of Khurasiya since childhood, training under the former India cricketer at his academy in Madhya Pradesh. The 26-year-old has always credited Khurasiya for his rise and for standing by him through tough times.Hailing from Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh, Ashutosh began his domestic cricket journey in 2018 with Madhya Pradesh. However, it was in 2024 that he made a bold move to T20 cricket with Railways due to lack of opportunities — a decision that turned heads and put him in the spotlight.In October 2023, Ashutosh etched his name in the record books by breaking a 16-year-old milestone set by Yuvraj Singh — the fastest fifty by an Indian batter in T20s.Playing for Railways against Arunachal Pradesh in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he hammered a blistering half-century in just 11 balls, making headlines.His explosive batting earned him an IPL contract with the Punjab Kings , who signed him for Rs 20 lakh. He made the most of the opportunity with his fearless stroke play and incredible finishing skills. In nine matches he scored 189 runs at a staggering strike rate of 167.However, Punjab Kings released him ahead of the IPL 2025 Mega Auction, and Delhi Capitals wasted no time in securing the star batter.Is this Punjab Kings' loss, Delhi Capitals' gain?""There is a section of the think tank in Delhi that needs to consider this. It’s not just Punjab Kings' loss—it’s also a big loss for MP cricket. He is a genius cricketer and with a great mind on his shoulders, and he is not playing for Madhya Pradesh. That's sad actually. He is a very positive player, always hungry to play for India. And the best part is that he is maturing with age.

head-to-head

RR in IPL 2025: Rajasthan Royals hope for first title in 17 years

After struggling in their previous matches, defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals will be looking for a quick turnaround when they meet in an IPL match on Wednesday.The Knight Riders suffered a seven-wicket loss to Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the tournament opener, while the Royals faced a 44-run defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad.Both teams shared a common issue in their losses: their usually strong batting and bowling units failed to perform. Although RR might defend their bowling difficulties by citing the challenging conditions in Hyderabad, KKR have no such excuse.Aside from Sunil Narine, none of KKR's bowlers managed to contain the aggressive RCB batters, and they will be concerned about the struggles of mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy, who was hit hard even on a gripping Eden Gardens pitch by Phil Salt and Virat Kohli.The KKR camp will be hopeful that Chakravarthy will find his form on the Guwahati pitch, which typically offers some assistance to bowlers. They will also monitor Anrich Nortje's fitness as he recovers from a back strain; if cleared by the physios, he will likely replace Spencer Johnson.KKR's middle-order batting collapsed after a strong start from skipper Ajinkya Rahane and Narine, leaving them with a disappointing total. Key players like Venkatesh Iyer and Andre Russell fell to poor, premeditated shots, and KKR will want them to show better game awareness.Additionally, KKR will be counting on Rinku Singh to regain his hitting ability lower down the order, which is essential for turning a decent score into a more formidable one. His recent T20 form has been concerning, with scores of 11, 9, 8, 30, 9, and 12 in the IPL opener.Rinku and his top-order teammates will be hoping that the Rajasthan bowlers struggle to find their rhythm once more. Jofra Archer, who had an expensive outing against SRH, along with Fazalhaq Farooqi and Maheesh Theekshana, will need to improve after being overwhelmed by the attacks of Travis Head and Ishan Kishan, with Archer conceding 76 runs in his overs.Guwahati presents an opportunity for them to bounce back. Stand-in skipper Riyan Parag, who appeared uncertain on the field at times, will need to exhibit sharper, more decisive leadership against KKR, as the Rahul Dravid-coached side seeks to regain their form.Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals have met 30 times in the IPL history. They are on an even footing at 14 wins for both. Two matches finished without a result. RR have been unbeaten against KKR since the 2022 season (two wins in three matches, one was abandoned).",Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals meet in IPL 2025 on Wednesday. defending champions KKR lost to Royal Challengers Bengaluru in tournament opener.

DC in IPL 2025: Delhi Capitals target maiden title under Axar Patel

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

Delhi Capitals (DC) batter Ashutosh Sharma is currently the talk of the town following an unbeaten 66 off 31 balls, which helped his team pull off a 1-wicket win in their IPL 2025 match against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG). DC managed to chase down a target of 210 after being reduced to 65/5 in 6.4 overs due to Ashutosh's composed knock under pressure.The 26-year-old batter showcased mental strength of the highest order, pulling off a win against the odds. However, this certainly wasn't the first time where Ashutosh displayed his calibre, as evident from an anecdote shared by Railways head coach Nikhil Doru regarding the batter's Ranji Trophy debut against Gujarat in January 2024.""The selectors were completely unwilling to pick him in Railways' squad for the Ranji Trophy. They said, 'Ashutosh doesn't know how to bat. He can only hit big shots'. I kept pushing for his selection terming him a necessity considering his ability to emerge as a game-changer. Ashutosh wasn't picked in the squad for the first three to four matches. However, he eventually got picked for the game against Gujarat, being fully aware that he would be definitely dropped in case of a failure as the selectors were still strongly against him,"" said Doru in an exclusive interaction with""The odds were against Ashutosh as the match was being played at Valsad where Gujarat had an edge with the conditions quite bowler-friendly. There was also some controversy around the Railways lineup for the match as two different team sheets had been presented during the toss. One included Ashutosh's name while the other didn't. Due to this confusion, I had to send a bowler Karn Sharma out to bat before Ashutosh when we were 135/5 during our first innings, as we had to obtain permission from the BCCI regarding Ashutosh featuring in the match. It took 15-20 minutes to obtain permission. I was scared during that period of time as Ashutosh wouldn't have been able to do much in case we were eight wickets down,"" he added.The 26-year-old batter eventually walked out to bat following Karn's dismissal with the team's score reading 145/6.""Before Ashutosh walked out to bat, I told Gujarat spinner Ravi Bishnoi that our batting has just started. He laughed and said, 'What are you saying?'. Despite having only bowlers for company, Ashutosh managed to help us score 313, smashing 123 off 84 balls in a knock comprising 12 fours and eight sixes. It boosted our morale massively as we had fully expected to get bowled out for 200. We eventually won that match by 184 runs,"" stated Doru.Ashutosh also holds the record for scoring the fastest fifty by an Indian in T20 cricket. The 26-year-old batter reached the milestone in just 11 balls during Railways' Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT) match against Arunachal Pradesh in October 2023.""Batters usually look to stabilise after losing a wicket. Ashutosh simply backed himself and smashed sixes for fun. Following his knock, he told me, 'I went for my shots because I knew you wouldn't scold me'. Many coaches don't like someone who doesn't listen to them and does what he likes but Ashutosh simply follows his heart,"" said Doru.""Ashutosh is a big believer in visualisation. He focuses on visualising success and glory, then goes about executing it in the best possible manner. Ashutosh told me that he has visualised winning the IPL with DC this season,"" he stated.","Delhi Capitals (DC) batter Ashutosh Sharma is currently the talk of the town following an unbeaten 66 off 31 balls, which helped his team pull off a 1-wicket win in their IPL 2025 match against Lucknow Super Giants.

NEW DELHI: India and Bangladesh played out a goal-less draw in their 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifying match on Tuesday. The Bangladesh side showed better form in the initial half, generating more attacks and corner kicks, though without creating definitive scoring opportunities.The second half saw India displaying improved control, applying substantial pressure on Bangladesh, yet struggling to create meaningful chances.A crucial moment occurred in the 12th minute when Indian goalkeeper Vishal Kaith's miscalculated kick deflected off an opponent. Mohammed Ridoy attempted to capitalise with a left-footed shot, but Subhasish Bose made a vital clearance on the goal line.India's notable opportunity arrived in the 31st minute when Udanta Singh's header from Liston Colaco's left-wing cross was saved by Bangladesh keeper Mitul Marma.India's second-half dominance included Bose's ambitious long-range attempt in the 68th minute, which narrowly missed the left corner despite beating the goalkeeper.Five minutes afterwards, Farukh Choudhary's right-footed shot deflected off a Bangladeshi defender and went wide.In the 84th minute, Sunil Chhetri found space for a free header in the box, but his attempt lacked both accuracy and power.Bangladesh's Hamza Choudhury, on loan at Sheffield United from Leicester City, remained largely ineffective throughout the match.The teams will meet again on November 18 in Bangladesh.

Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter and ex-UEFA president Michel Platini have secured their second court victory against Swiss federal prosecutors. Both were acquitted again on charges related to fraud, forgery, mismanagement, and misappropriation of over $2 million in FIFA funds from 2011.Blatter, now 89 years old, showed little reaction as he listened to the verdict from three cantonal judges serving as a federal criminal appeals court. Sitting in front of Platini, he alternated between tapping his fingers and resting his left hand over his mouth.Platini, on the other hand, sat with his arms crossed or rubbing his hands as he listened to a translator beside him conveying the court's decision from German to his native French.The Swiss attorney general’s office had appealed a previous acquittal from July 2022, seeking 20-month sentences, suspended for two years.Both Blatter and Platini have consistently denied any wrongdoing in this decade-long case, which hinged on their claims of a verbal agreement regarding the disputed payment.In February 2011, Blatter approved a payment of 2 million Swiss francs (approximately $2.21 million) to football legend Platini for supplementary and non-contracted salary as a presidential advisor from 1998 to 2002.This latest victory for Blatter and 69-year-old Platini marks exactly 9½ years since the Swiss federal investigation was made public, triggering events that ended the careers of some of football’s most influential figures.On that September day in 2015 in Zurich, police arrived to question them at FIFA after an executive committee meeting, as Platini was a strong favorite to succeed his former mentor in an upcoming election.Despite federal court trials clearing their names twice, Blatter’s legacy will likely remain intertwined with his leadership of FIFA during corruption scandals that implicated many senior football officials worldwide.Platini, one of the sport's greatest players and once Blatter’s protégé in politics, never achieved the FIFA presidency he often believed was his destined role.","Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini have been acquitted by a Swiss court.

Shillong: How much can one footballer influence the fate of a team or the course of its history? Sunil Chhetri made some good points on that with a strike in his comeback for India vs Maldives in the friendly last week as the hosts returned to winning ways after over a year of winless results.And while he and coach Manolo Marquez will look to carry that momentum into the crucial AFC Asian Cup Qualifier against Bangladesh here on Tuesday, their opponents on the day will be eager for the trump card up their sleeve, Hamza Choudhury , to earn their first win against India since 2003.The lead-up to the teams’ opening Group C match at JN Stadium here may have been dominated by the hype surrounding two footballers – one, the third highest active scorer in international football after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, and the other, a veteran of 57 Premier League matches for Leicester City.But all 22 players on the pitch will have to play their roles well to churn out three points and take a positive step towards qualification for Saudi Arabia 2027. “I think it’s exciting having Hamza and having Sunil back. It’s going to be really competitive. But it’s not going to be only about them,” Bangladesh coach Javier Cabrera said on Monday. “If we win tomorrow, it will not only be for Hamza.”His fellow Spaniard and Indian counterpart Marquez echoed the same feelings for a Chhetri-inspired India while also acknowledging the importance of starting the qualifiers on a winning note, with matches against Hong Kong and Singapore to follow thereafter. “The first game is obviously very important. It’s a short competition, only the top team qualifies for the tournament. There are six games and we need to finish first. We want to get the maximum points possible to qualify for Saudi Arabia,” he said on match eve on Monday.Already laden with injury woes, the latest being in-form Brandon Fernandes against Maldives, it will be interesting to see if Marquez utilises the pace of the young Macarton Nickson or the experience of Udanta Singh — the new inductees into the squad — to make up for Fernandes’ absence on Tuesday.He will, however, have been impressed by performances of Hmingthanmawia Ralte at right-back and, going forward, goalscorer Liston Colaco down the left, debutant Ayush Dev Chhetri in midfield, and the aerial prowess of Rahul Bheke, and will hope for them to carry the show vs Bangladesh.However, India have drawn two of their last three matches against Bangladesh, all of which came in the Igor Stimac era, and were lucky to get away with a point through Adil Khan’s late equaliser in their last clash. While the hosts will be wary of a motivated Bangladesh having Sheffield United’s Choudhury making his debut for his national team, it wouldn’t be a surprise if Choudhury is pushed further upfield, unlike the deeper midfield role he occupies for his clubs in England, to make a difference with his quality higher up.Also, the partnership that he scripts with skipper and veteran Jamal Bhuyan in the middle could well decide Bangladesh’s fortunes in this match and throughout the qualifying campaign.“We know it’s not only Hamza, they have other good players. (And) the same coach for the last three years with the same philosophy. Continuity is obviously important in any team,” acknowledged the Indian coach, adding, “But I feel that if we play a good game, we will win this one. But obviously, if you ask Javi Cabrera the same, he will say the opposite.”Tuesday will reveal which Spaniard emerges on top in the South Asian derby or if the cycle of draws between them continues.","India take on Bangladesh in their first AFC Asian Cup qualifier on Tuesday.

Shillong: When Shillong hosted its first-ever international match last Wednesday, less than 7,000 fans in this football-crazy region turned up at the JN Stadium to watch India clinch their first international win in 12 games, and the first since November 2023.The first taste of international football in Meghalaya was in stark contrast with the three Indian Super League matches played here, each of which garnered over twice the footfall for the FIFA friendly.Interestingly, the largest crowd was for NorthEast United FC’s match against Bengaluru FC — with fans filling up the venue to see Sunil Chhetri in action.

Argentina moved closer to securing their spot in the 2026 World Cup after defeating Uruguay 1-0 in Montevideo on Friday, thanks to a brilliant goal from Thiago Almada.The match appeared to be heading towards a draw against Uruguay, who had previously defeated Argentina 2-0 in Buenos Aires during the qualifying rounds.The decisive moment came when Almada, the 23-year-old attacking midfielder, received the ball on the edge of the area and unleashed a powerful shot into the top corner, beyond Uruguay goalkeeper Sergio Rochet's reach.Argentina's otherwise strong performance was slightly marred in stoppage time when Nicolas Gonzalez received a red card for a dangerous high boot challenge on Uruguay's Nahitan Nandez.Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni expressed satisfaction with his team's performance, particularly in Messi's absence due to injury.""How can I not be satisfied? Not just for the result -- but for how they gave it their all. The satisfaction comes from the fact that the team played a complete match. When one player is missing, another comes in (...) we have enough to go out onto the field calmly, but the team is there.""Argentina can become the first South American team to qualify for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico if they defeat Brazil in Buenos Aires on Tuesday.Argentina currently leads the South American qualifying group with 28 points from 13 games, followed by Ecuador in second place with 22 points and Brazil in third with 21 points.Uruguay holds fourth position with 20 points from 13 matches, just ahead of Paraguay on goal difference.The victory guarantees Argentina at least a seventh-place finish, ensuring them a minimum of an inter-confederation playoff spot, with the top six teams qualifying directly for the World Cup.In another South American qualifier, Ecuador strengthened their qualification chances by defeating Venezuela 2-1, with veteran striker Enner Valencia scoring both goals.Ecuador is pursuing their fifth World Cup appearance in the nation's history.Ecuador's coach Sebastian Beccacece commented on the team's performance while emphasizing the importance of staying focused.""When things are going well, like today when we've won three games in a row, we have to be cautious, calm, humble, and have a lot of discipline to continue growing in what's coming up.""","Argentina defeated Uruguay 1-0 in Montevideo on Friday. Thiago Almada scored the only goal of the game. Argentina can qualify for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Australia's Alex de Minaur put an end to Brazilian talent Joao Fonseca 's challenge at the Miami Open, outlasting the 18-year-old 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in an enthralling contest.Attendance on stadium court had been sparse throughout Monday, but the Hard Rock Stadium turned into a mini-Maracana Stadium for Fonseca's match, complete with Brazilian flags and football-style chanting.Fonseca brought his energetic brand of ultra-attacking tennis, but De Minaur was up to the challenge, coping with both the blistering forehands and the partisan crowd.Such was the dominance of Fonseca's raucous support that the referee switched to Portuguese for his appeals for quiet.But de Minaur won six of the final seven games to move into the fourth round, keeping his cool even when the crowd, at times, disrupted his serve preparation.""Mentally I was ready for this match, I knew I was not only going to play an incredible talent like Joao, playing with immense confidence and nothing to lose, but also an incredible crowd that was on his side from the first point until the last,"" de Minaur said.""One of my biggest strengths is my mentality and that is what got me the win today,"" he added.Top seed Alexander Zverev recovered from a slow start to power into the fourth round of the Miami Open with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Australia's Jordan Thompson.The German was 4-1 down in the first set but then went on a roll, winning eight of the next nine games to progress.Zverev lost in the opening round at Indian Wells, but with Carlos Alcaraz already out in Miami he will fancy his chances of adding to his list of seven Masters 1000 titles.Third-seed Taylor Fritz also moved into the fourth round beating Denis Shapovalov of Canada 7-5, 6-3.The American let slip a 5-2 lead in the first set, but regained control with his serve proving too much for Shapovalov.In the women's draw, third-seed Coco Gauff 's bid ended with a 6-4 6-4 loss to Poland's Magda Linette .Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka eased her way into the last eight with a 6-4, 6-4 win over last year's winner Danielle Collins of the USA.Next, Sabalenka will be up against ninth seeded Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen who reached her second consecutive WTA 1000 quarter-final, with a straight-sets win over Ashlyn Krueger.""I'm super happy to get this win in straight sets and happy with the level I played today,"" said Sabalenka.""She's a tough opponent, and we had a lot of tough and tricky matches in the past. So was very happy to get through this one,"" she added.Italy's Jasmine Paolini enjoyed a 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 comeback win over Naomi Osaka in 2 hours and 15 minutes.Since her comeback from maternity leave 15 months ago, Osaka has been showing some signs of getting back towards her best but Paolini was the first top 10 player Osaka has faced this year.""I don't think that I can say that I've played a lot of matches against top players like this in a while,"" said Osaka.""The way she plays kind of catches me off guard, simply because of her height. I didn't know she could hit like that,"" she added.Emma Raducanu continued her impressive form in Miami, cruising to a 6-1, 6-3 victory in 69 minutes over American Amanda Anisimova, who had eliminated Indian Wells winner Mirra Andreeva on Sunday.It is the first time Raducanu has won four straight WTA Tour main draw matches in a row since her US Open triumph in 2021. She will face American Jessica Pegula next.Raducanu, who has brought in some old faces from the early days of her career for this tournament, said she was benefitting from their presence.""I'm really happy with how things are on and off the court right now and just so happy that's able to transfer on to the match court,"" she said.Alexandra Eala, the 19-year-old from the Philippines who upset Australian Open champion Madison Keys on Sunday, was handed a place in the quarter-finals after her fourth round opponent, Spain's Paula Badosa, pulled out with a lower back injury.In the last eight Eala will face second seed Iga Swiatek who battled past Ukraine's Elina Svitolina 7-6 (7/5) 6-3.","Alex de Minaur beats Joao Fonseca 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in enthralling contest. Top seed Alexander Zverev recovers from slow start to beat Jordan Thompson.

Alexandra Eala , a 19-year-old tennis player from the Philippines, achieved a historic victory at the Miami Open on Sunday by defeating Australian Open champion Madison Keys .This win marked a significant milestone as Eala became the first Filipino woman to defeat a top-10 ranked player since the ranking system's inception 50 years ago.The emotional victory saw Eala celebrating with her team, embracing them while fighting back tears.""It's a big thing to take in, and I feel it's important for me to take it in step by step. I'm so super proud of what I was able to accomplish, but it definitely fuels me more.""""I know and it's in my mind that I have a next match, but I need to stop, and I need to recognise that what I did today was really amazing. I think my reaction on court, you know, sums up pretty much how I feel about it.""At the age of 13, Eala's family made the decision to send her to Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca, Spain, recognizing her evident talent.The academy's exceptional coaching and facilities helped shape Eala into the 2022 US Open girls' singles champion and a competitive player on the WTA Tour .""The academy has been my home for the past seven years. Of course, my family should take credit for the foundation that they laid out before they sent me there.""""But of course, the academy was able to build on that foundation in such a way that I'm able to be where I am now. And I think the combination of everything that I've been through since I started tennis is what has led to this moment and what has led to me having all these opportunities.""The decision to move to Europe was made easier as her brother Miko also joined the academy.""It was definitely a big decision for me, for us. As soon as I heard that, I jumped at the opportunity because I knew that I had to get out of the country eventually to improve.""Eala's tennis journey began with her grandfather, a club player who coached her brother and cousins before focusing on her development.""I was kind of the next in line to do that and to spend time with him. It eventually blossomed into the career I have now.""Her victory came shortly after fellow Nadal Academy member Coleman Wong from Hong Kong defeated American 13th seed Ben Shelton in Miami.""I'm super happy for him and to see someone that I've known so long do so well is definitely an inspiration. Not just to me, but I feel in general a lot of people can take inspiration from him.""Despite her success, Eala maintains a humble perspective about being a role model for young players in the Philippines.""The young kids, the youth in the Philippines, they don't need to take inspiration from me. They can take inspiration from anyone they want. You know, they can take inspiration from other things, which is what I did growing up.""","Alexandra Eala became the first Filipino woman to defeat a top-10 ranked player since the ranking system's inception 50 years ago.

You didn't have anyone from where you're from to pave the way. Of course you had many people to look up to around the world, but I think -- I hope this takes Filipino tennis to the next step.""Keys acknowledged her performance was below par, following her recent defeat to Aryna Sabalenka at Indian Wells.""My serve was not really there today and I just kind of felt a little flat -- and when you are playing someone who makes a ton of balls back and absorbs really well, that's not really the keys to success.""Eleventh-seeded Andreeva faced physical challenges during her match against Miami resident Anisimova, requiring medical attention for an abdominal issue early in the first set.The match lasted 2 hours and 49 minutes, with Anisimova winning 7-6 (7/5), 2-6, 6-3.

British tennis star Jack Draper 's momentum from his Indian Wells victory was halted at the Miami Open on Saturday, suffering a defeat to Czech Republic's Jakub Mensik, ranked 54th in the world.Draper had achieved a career milestone by entering the top 10 rankings after defeating Holger Rune in the Indian Wells final last Sunday, following his victory over Carlos Alcaraz in the semifinals.The 19-year-old Mensik demonstrated exceptional skill, securing victory through two tie-breaks with scores of 7-6 (7/2), 7-6 (7/3).""It was tough, obviously I came up against someone today who was playing incredibly well. He served 10 out of 10, I couldn't get a read or a look on his serve at all.

BENGALURU: Vedant Mohan -- India’s most promising sub-junior tennis player (under-14) – has kickstarted the next step of his junior career, transitioning to the International Tennis Federation’s junior Tour (under-18).The 14-year-old, who had been locked down at his training base in Javea, a coastal town in Spain since February, started by playing a couple of base-level ITFs in Sri Lanka these last weeks. He's scheduled for more J30s and J60s in May, most likely in Africa.Vedant, left-handed, also plays on the Spanish circuit and has gained immensely in the last few years competing in Tennis Europe events alongside some of the best under-14 talents in the world. Vedant’s highest ranking in the under-14 section of the Tennis Europe ratings was achieved on his 14th birthday this January, when he still had another 12 months left in the age-group.He was ranked No.13 and at the time, the only Asian in the top 25.While playing in Europe helped grow Vedant’s game, the 5-feet-8-inch Indian couldn’t play the full circuit. He didn’t qualify for the European Championships, the Summer or Winter Cups, all big-ticket competitions, and open only to Europeans as they are team events.That, along with the fact that he was cash-strapped, contributed to Vedant’s rather limited matchplay in comparison to his peers (2011-born) who were ranked higher than him.For instance, the TE No.1 (U-14) Mario Vukovic of France has played 176 singles matches and the No.2 Greece’s Rafael Pagonis played 192 while Vedant has played just 102.The 14-year-old will now play a mix of U-16 and U-18 tournaments in Spain, while targeting ITF under-18s. Vedant’s parents – father Dhruv and mother Anisha – moved to Spain five years ago when their son, then nine, received a tennis scholarship.Mohan, a commercial pilot, has for most part funded Vedant’s mushrooming career, while also leaning on Anisha’s and his family back home in India. He lives in Muscat, while Anisha and their two sons live in Javea, where Vedant trains under Javier Ferrer, brother of former top-5 pro David.Vedant, who idolises tennis legend Novak Djokovic because of his mentality, says his favourite surface is clay.“I love that I can rip the ball hard and heavy with topspin on clay. Also, I love to slide,” he told TOI. “My favourite shot is my inside-out forehand. I like to play aggressively, my game is all court. I like to volley and also play with variation.”Mohan, a collegiate-level tennis player in India, winning gold medals in singles and doubles, is hoping his son will be part of junior Grand Slam draws in the next 18-to-24 months.“The ultimate goal is the pros, the ATP Tour,” he said, adding, “At this stage we’re only looking to develop his game.”","Vedant Mohan is India’s most promising sub-junior tennis player (under-14) The 14-year-old will now play a mix of U-16 and U-18 tournaments in Spain.

Miami: Carlos Alcaraz , ranked world number three, experienced an unexpected early elimination from the Miami Open on Friday. Belgian veteran David Goffin secured a remarkable comeback victory with a score of 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 at Hard Rock Stadium .Goffin, aged 34 and currently ranked 55th, had previously defeated Alcaraz in Astana three years ago. Noticing Alcaraz's subpar performance in the opening set, Goffin adopted an aggressive approach.Goffin, who once achieved a career-high ranking of No.7 in 2017, delivered impressive winning shots while Alcaraz struggled with unforced errors. The Belgian player managed to secure a break advantage in all three sets, and despite losing his lead in the first set, he maintained composure to secure the victory.""When I came out earlier... just to warm up on the court, I felt 'I'm moving well. I'm feeling quite relaxed. I'm hitting the ball really well' and so I hoped it would be the same during the match.""""I started the match well. I had the break in the first and he started to play really well at the end of the first.""""It's that kind of night that I will remember for sure -- against Carlos and in a stadium like that. And the night that gave me a lot of confidence to continue.""Daniil Medvedev also faced an early exit following a 6-2, 6-3 loss to Spain's Jaume Munar, ranked 56th. Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic secured a straight-sets victory over Australian Rinky Hijikata.Medvedev, who won the Miami title in 2023, displayed frustration by throwing his racket multiple times. Munar, the 27-year-old from Mallorca, achieved his third career victory over a top 10 opponent.The Russian player committed 32 unforced errors and failed to convert two break points in the final game despite having an opportunity to mount a comeback.""Yeah, I was not 100% physically, but I tried my best to get into the match. Every day was better and better. I had some problems after Indian Wells. Can happen.""""He played well, so that's why (he won) I wouldn't go to the match if I would kind of definitely know I'm not ready to win.""Djokovic, who previously lost to a lucky loser at Indian Wells, defeated 86th-ranked Hijikata 6-0, 7-6 (7/1), ending his three-match losing streak. He has now matched Rafael Nadal's record of 410 match wins in Masters 1000 tournaments since their inception in 1990.Karen Khachanov halted Nick Kyrgios's comeback with a 7-6 (7/3), 6-0 victory. Kyrgios, returning from wrist surgery, had secured his first tour-level win since October 2022 against Mackenzie McDonald but couldn't overcome Khachanov, a semi-finalist in Miami last year.In the women's competition, world number two Iga Swiatek advanced to the third round by defeating France's Caroline Garcia 6-2, 7-5. The match proved more challenging than their recent encounter at Indian Wells.Swiatek faced a 3-1 deficit in the second set and saved a set point while serving at 5-4 down before winning the final three games.""My energy level got down really fast.

Miami:

Australian Nick Kyrgios won his first match since 2022 as he fought back from a set down to beat American Mackenzie McDonald 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 at the Miami Open on Wednesday.Kyrgios's career has been blighted by injuries in the last two years and he had to retire from his first round match at Indian Wells earlier this month.The flamboyant 29-year-old had suffered pain in his surgically reconstructed right wrist - a procedure that left him on the sidelines for 18 months.""It has been a long journey, even to just get to the start line of matches and be scared to just finish them,"" Kyrgios said.""To come off and get a win and feel like I belong again was special,"" added after the one-hour, 43-minute victory.Kyrgios, the 2022 Wimbledon finalist, has been plagued by injuries in his career but it was the wrist which caused him the most serious issues and he said he was deeply pessimistic about his chances of a comeback.""I never thought I would play tennis again to be brutally honest with you. I was having conversations with my camp and my team, and I said 'I don't know how long I can keep doing this for',"" he said.""This (win) puts some petrol in the tank but I need to be realistic and see how my wrist feels tomorrow because it is a grind out here,"" he added.There was a first round win for 38-year-old Frenchman Gael Monfils who became the second oldest man, after Jimmy Connors, to win at the Miami Open.Monfils beat last year's quarter-finalist, Hungary's Fabian Marozsan, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.In the women's draw, Emma Raducanu claimed her first win, defeating 19-year-old wild card Sayaka Ishii of Japan 6-2, 6-1 in just 65 minutes.The 2021 US Open champion will face eighth-seeded American Emma Navarro in the second round, her first meeting with a top 10 player since losing to Iga Swiatek in the Australian Open third round.""It's going to be an extremely challenging match,"" Raducanu said in her on-court interview.

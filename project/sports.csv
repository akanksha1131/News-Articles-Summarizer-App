Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

‘RACISM? ZERO TOLERANCE’

MLC: Venky Harinarayan on growing cricket in the USA, AI-driven teams and the Olympic boost





NEW DELHI: Already retired from T20Is following India’s T20 World Cup triumph, and having stepped away from Test cricket ahead of the five-match series in England, the two stalwarts — Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma — will be seen in action when India tour Australia for a three-match ODI series starting in October. Along with the ODIs, India will also play five T20Is during the tour.Cricket Australia CEO Todd Greenberg said Australia is gearing up for a massive summer of cricket, featuring both the Indian men's and women's teams.Greenberg also shared his excitement about the limited-overs series in October-November 2025, which could potentially be the last time Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma don the ODI jersey Down Under.""It's a massive summer of cricket, highlighted by both the Indian women's and men's teams. Also, the Ashes is here. And for the first time in nearly two decades, Australian cricket will be playing international matches in every single capital city and territory across the entire country — which, you know, is amazing when you think about the logistical exercise that goes with that,"" Greenberg told reporters.""But to answer the question — look, there's a lot of work going into bespoke marketing plans for every game in every city.Some of those will be nuanced to local markets — whether we're playing, you know, in Far North Queensland when South Africa are here, or in our big cities when both India’s men's and women's teams are visiting. So, a lot of work is going into that.""""I think we saw real momentum last year on the back of the BGT series — you know, some record-breaking ticket sales. And I anticipate that we’ll see a number of sellouts across the summer, really starting in August and going through until March. This might be a summer like we’ve never seen before, just in terms of the amount of content. And if you think about the quality of the players coming, particularly from India — this might be the last time we get to see Virat Kohli or Rohit Sharma play in our country. If that’s the case — who knows, it might not be — but if it is, we want to make sure we give them a great send-off and acknowledge the incredible contribution they've made to international cricket,"" Greenberg added.Greenberg also addressed past racism incidents during India’s previous tours to Australia.During the Sydney Test in 2021, Indian pacer Mohammed Siraj faced racial abuse from sections of the crowd. Both Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah were targeted, prompting the Indian team management to lodge an official complaint with match referee David Boon.""Well, my message is a simple one: everyone should feel welcome and safe in any format of our game here in this country. If there are any instances of inappropriate behavior, we will have zero tolerance for it. People who behave poorly in those areas will be dealt with accordingly,"" Greenberg said.""As I’ve said, I want our Indian fans — in fact, all fans, whether they’re English fans coming for the Ashes or Indian fans arriving for the Border-Gavaskar series — to feel welcome, to be able to support their teams, but never to be abused. Anyone engaging in abusive behavior will be removed from our stadiums. We’ll also continue our efforts in educating fans and fostering a respectful environment.""We’re aware that, from time to time, people may do the wrong thing — but we will not excuse that behavior. Those individuals will be removed because attending a match should be considered a privilege, not a right. If you don’t behave in the way we expect, you won’t be welcomed. We want to ensure that Indian players and fans — and fans from all countries — feel very welcome and safe at every one of our venues,"" he added.","India will tour Australia for a three-match ODI series starting in October.

Bold prediction! Astrologer Greenstone Lobo picks winner of Australia vs South Africa WTC Final 2025

Poll Who do you think will win the WTC final? Australia South Africa





Australia maintained their advantage in the World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord's on Thursday, led by captain Pat Cummins 's exceptional bowling performance and Alex Carey's crucial 43 runs. Despite a dramatic collapse that saw Australia reduced to 73-7 in their second innings, they ended the day at 144-8, establishing a substantial lead of 218 runs.Pat Cummins delivered a remarkable spell, taking four wickets for just one run as South Africa were bowled out for 138 in response to Australia's first-innings total of 212. Cummins finished with impressive figures of 6-28, reaching the milestone of 300 Test wickets.The second day witnessed a flurry of wickets, with 28 dismissals across both teams on a pitch that offered some assistance to fast bowlers but remained playable. The match, originally scheduled for five days, could potentially conclude before the third day's end. Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi led South Africa's bowling attack in Australia's second innings. Rabada, who had already claimed 5-51 in the first innings, continued his strong performance with 3-44, while Ngidi contributed with 3-35.South Africa's captain Temba Bavuma and David Bedingham provided the only substantial resistance during their first innings, sharing a fifth-wicket partnership of 64 runs. Bavuma scored 36 while Bedingham contributed 45.The Australian collapse began when Rabada dismissed Usman Khawaja for six and Cameron Green for a duck in the 11th over. Green's brief appearance resulted in just four runs from five balls across both innings. Marnus Labuschagne, in his debut as a Test opener, was caught behind for 22 off Marco Jansen. Beau Webster, who had top-scored with 72 in Australia's first innings, fell lbw to Ngidi, reducing Australia to 48-4.The situation worsened for Australia when Cummins was bowled by Ngidi's yorker, leaving them at 73-7. However, Carey and Mitchell Starc mounted a recovery, sharing an eighth-wicket partnership of 61 runs before Carey was dismissed lbw by Rabada. The day's final over saw a missed opportunity when Jansen dropped Starc, then on 14, off Wiaan Mulder's bowling. Starc remained unbeaten on 16 at stumps.Cummins's outstanding bowling performance earned him a place on the Lord's honours board. His reception was notably different from two years ago when he faced boos following a controversial stumping incident involving Carey and Jonny Bairstow during an Ashes Test.The match remains poised with Australia on the front foot, holding a 218-run lead with two wickets remaining in their second innings.",Australia lead South Africa by 218 runs with two wickets remaining in second innings. Pat Cummins takes four wickets for just one run as South Africa are bowled out for 138. Cummins also reaches 300 Test wickets with his 6/28 spell.

Kevin Durant drops 5-word reaction to viral Michael Jordan clip picking him over Kobe Bryant and LeBron James,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/kevin-durant-drops-5-word-reaction-to-viral-michael-jordan-clip-picking-him-over-kobe-bryant-and-lebron-james/articleshow/121765875.cms,"Images via Getty Images

“Goat was on to something”: Kevin Durant’s bold reaction to resurfaced Michael Jordan clip

Image via Instagram

Resurfaced video reveals Michael Jordan’s true pick for the best player



Michael Jordan chooses between LeBron & Kobe





Kevin Durant rarely misses when it comes to basketball—and apparently, not when it comes to legacy debates either. The Phoenix Suns superstar recently came across a resurfaced Michael Jordan clip that’s catching fire again on social media. In the video, Jordan jokingly mentions Durant while weighing in on the infamous Kobe Bryant vs. LeBron James question. Now, more than a decade later, Durant’s sharp but playful response has reignited the conversation, with fans and media alike taking notice.It all started when a throwback clip from 2013 began circulating across social platforms this week. In it, NBA legend Michael Jordan is asked one of basketball’s most heated questions: Kobe or LeBron? Sitting down with analyst Ahmad Rashad for the “Michael Jordan at 50” special, Jordan seemed momentarily caught off guard before throwing out an unexpected name: “Kevin Durant.”Though Jordan immediately laughed and clarified that he was joking—“Naw, I’m just kidding,” he said—the clip has lived on in NBA lore as a light-hearted but fascinating moment. And this week, it got new life when Durant himself saw the post and added fuel to the fire.“Goat was on to something,” Durant wrote in the comments section, flipping the joke into a subtle flex that left fans buzzing. Kevin Durant , who turns 37 this year and will enter his 18th NBA season, is widely recognized as one of the most skilled scorers in league history.The two-time NBA champion and two-time Finals MVP has averaged 27.2 points per game across his career while maintaining an elite shooting clip of over 50%. With that kind of resume, even a joke from Jordan feels like a nod worth keeping in the vault.The moment drew even more attention thanks to another clip included in the video—this one featuring a resurfaced quote from Kobe Bryant that added weight to the conversation. “Kevin Durant. That was the one I retired without being able to figure out how I can stop him,” Bryant once admitted. That rare praise from one all-time great to another only added gravity to Durant’s reaction.The viral interview dates back to early 2013, when Michael Jordan was reflecting on his legacy ahead of his 50th birthday. The special, titled “Michael Jordan at 50,” gave the six-time NBA champion a chance to weigh in on the league’s future—and the players most often compared to him.When asked “Kobe or LeBron?” by Rashad, Jordan initially responded with a smirk and said “Kevin Durant” before laughing it off. Then, he gave a more measured answer.“In terms of dominance of the game of basketball, at this stage it’s LeBron,” Jordan acknowledged at the time, crediting James for his physical impact on the game during his Miami Heat prime.But Jordan wasn’t done. He added a clear preference for Bryant’s mentality and hunger.“Championship-wise, it’s Kobe Bryant . He wants it so bad and he’s willing to go to the extreme,” Jordan said. “Guarding a point guard at the age of 34, playing 38 minutes, 40 minutes, that’s ludicrous.”Jordan even suggested that Bryant shared his obsessive drive for greatness: “He’s cursed as much as I am.”When it came to championships—a standard Jordan always held in the highest regard—he summed it up plainly: “Five (rings) beats one.”More than a decade later, the Kobe vs. LeBron debate remains heated—but the narrative has evolved. LeBron James , who joined the Lakers in 2018, now holds four championship rings and recently became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, the first player ever to surpass 50,000 career points. His longevity and all-around excellence have kept him in the GOAT conversation.Bryant, who tragically passed away in 2020, remains a symbol of competitive spirit. He finished his career with five rings and a 5–2 record in the Finals, while Jordan, famously, went 6–0.Also Read: LeBron James or Kobe Bryant? Dwight Howard’s shocking pick in the legendary NBA debate between his two former teammates What began as a quick-witted joke from Jordan in a 2013 interview has taken on new life in 2025, especially now that Durant has joined the chat. With Kobe openly praising Durant’s unguardable game, and Jordan once (even jokingly) tossing his name into the GOAT conversation, Durant’s legacy is secure.","Kevin Durant responded to a resurfaced Michael Jordan clip from 2013.

The Trade Mechanics: Jonathan Kuminga for Collins





Theare reportedly considering a bold sign-and-trade deal to acquire ex- Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins, potentially sending young star Jonathan Kuminga the other way. This move aims to address the Warriors’ glaring need for consistent scoring beyond Stephen Curry. Golden State Warriors ’ lack of reliable scorers outside Curry was exposed in their 2025 Western Conference Semi-Finals loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. While Kuminga showed flashes of brilliance, his restricted free agency status makes him a prime trade asset for a team seeking an immediate upgrade.The Jazz, meanwhile, are open to trading Collins after he opts into his $26.5 million expiring contract. As reported by Evan Sidery: ""The Jazz plan to explore trade scenarios for John Collins once he opts into his $26.5 million expiring contract. Collins averaged 18.9 points and 8.2 rebounds on a 62.8 TS% with Utah this season.""John Collins brings a mix of athleticism, floor spacing, and efficiency that could elevate the Golden State Warriors’ offense. Here’s how his 2024-25 stats stack up:His ability to stretch the floor and finish plays aligns perfectly with Golden State’s drive-and-kick system. Pairing Collins with Stephen Curry could create mismatches and open up the offense even further.Here’s why this deal makes sense for both sides:- Warriors Get: A proven scorer who fits their system, adding much-needed firepower.- Jazz Get: A young, high-upside player in Kuminga to build around for the future.Collins’ expiring $26.5 million contract could be matched via a sign-and-trade involving Kuminga, who is due for a new deal. Utah nearly traded Collins in February, and Golden State might finally pull the trigger.What This Means for the Golden State Warriors’ FutureAdding Collins could rejuvenate Golden State’s title hopes. His efficiency and versatility would take pressure off Curry, while Kuminga’s departure would be a calculated risk for a team in win-now mode.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to sign $238 million Utah Jazz to for Big 3 with LeBron James and Luka Doncic and bolster title odds If this trade materializes, the Warriors could re-emerge as a serious contender in the loaded Western Conference.","The Golden State Warriors are reportedly considering a sign-and-trade deal to acquire ex-Atlanta Hawks forward John Collins.

is managing lower leg discomfort but has no doubts about suiting up for Game 3 of the NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Despite visible limping after Sunday’s 123-107 loss, Haliburton remains confident he’ll be ready when the series resumes Wednesday night.The Indiana Pacers and Thunder are tied 1-1, with Game 3 tipping off at 8:30 p.m. ET in Indianapolis. Tyrese Haliburton, averaging 15.5 points and six assists in the series, acknowledged the injury but downplayed its severity.“It’s really just a lower leg thing, I’m gonna leave it at that,” Tyrese Haliburton said Tuesday. “I don’t think there’s anything more to elaborate.”Though he didn’t specify whether the issue was related to his calf or ankle, Haliburton’s history of hamstring problems—including a strain that sidelined him during last year’s Eastern Conference finals—raises questions about his durability. Still, neither he nor the Indiana Pacers appear overly concerned.Head coach Rick Carlisle confirmed Haliburton participated fully in Tuesday’s practice and expects him to play. “At this time of year, I don’t know if anybody’s feeling perfect,” Carlisle said. “He has some discomfort, but each day is getting better. This is the time of year where it just doesn’t get any better than this.”Beyond health, Tyrese Haliburton’s bigger challenge has been Oklahoma City’s elite defense.The Thunder, the NBA’s top-rated defensive team this season, have thrown multiple defenders at him, including Luguentz Dort, Cason Wallace, Alex Caruso, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.The strategy has worked so far. Haliburton has struggled with efficiency, shooting just 33% from three and averaging four turnovers per game. His assist-to-turnover ratio, usually stellar at nearly 9:1, has dipped significantly.“I feel like I haven’t been great by any means through the first two games,” Haliburton admitted. “I’m just trying to take what I can to prepare for Game 3. The answers always lie in the film.”Indiana’s turnover issues have been a major storyline. The team has coughed up the ball 40 times in two games, with many mistakes leading directly to Thunder points. Carlisle joked about some of the miscues, saying, “Some of our turnovers have been so violently bad, the opponent hasn’t even had a chance to catch the ball.”But the problem is no laughing matter. Against a disciplined team like Oklahoma City, wasted possessions are costly. “You can’t play too careful against them, or otherwise you’ll never get a basket,” Carlisle added.Carlisle also mentioned that a couple of other players are “slightly under the weather,” though he didn’t name them. Forward Aaron Nesmith (ankle) and center Tony Bradley (hip) have dealt with injuries earlier in the playoffs, but their status for Game 3 remains unclear.With the series shifting to Indianapolis, Tyrese Haliburton and the Indiana Pacers have a chance to regain control. His ability to shake off the leg discomfort and solve Oklahoma City’s defensive schemes will be key to Indiana’s title hopes.Also read: Skip Bayless’ Drops Bombshell After OKC Thunder Game 2 Domination – Can the Indiana Pacers Respond?

49ers’ Trent Williams believes Brock Purdy is just getting started



Trent Williams is all in on Brock Purdy being the 49ers franchise QB





When Trent Williams, the San Francisco 49ers’ legendary left tackle, took the podium earlier this week, his usual charisma lit up the room — but it was the mention of Brock Purdy’s new contract that brought out a different kind of joy. With a grin stretching ear to ear, Williams spoke with genuine pride about the quarterback’s journey from an overlooked draft pick to one of the NFL’s highest-paid players.“For me, it’s just super, super fulfilling just to watch a guy like Brock,” Trent Williams shared. “You talk about a Cinderella story, I think this is the epitome of that. A guy going from making a few hundred thousand a year to making 50 million a year, it’s astronomical, and it couldn’t have happened to a better guy.”Purdy’s meteoric rise began in 2022 when he was selected with the final pick of the draft — No. 262 overall. Thrust into action in Week 13 after Jimmy Garoppolo's injury, the unassuming rookie guided the 49ers to a commanding 33-17 win over the Miami Dolphins. The following week, he was named the starter — and never looked back.Since then, Purdy has carried San Francisco to back-to-back NFC Championship Games and a Super Bowl appearance.Despite a rocky 2024 season, where the team stumbled to a 6-11 record and missed the playoffs, confidence in Purdy hasn’t wavered inside the 49ers’ locker room. Both head coach Kyle Shanahan and GM John Lynch have stood firmly behind him — and Williams is no different.“He is the guy for this team,” Williams declared. “He is the guy for this franchise. This is just the tip of the iceberg. He is going to get another contract, he’s going to win a lot of football games. He’s that good of a player. Super, super happy to see that for him. I love him like a brother, so I couldn’t be any happier.”This offseason, Purdy signed a five-year, $265 million extension, securing his place with the 49ers through the 2030 season. Although initial negotiations were rocky — with Purdy reportedly seeking $65 million per year — the final agreement landed at $53 million annually, including $182.55 million in guarantees. It's a significant bet on a quarterback who still has plenty to prove, especially after a step back statistically in 2024 (3,864 yards, 20 TDs, 12 INTs).Purdy now faces the challenge of leading a restructured team, with several key departures in free agency. However, he can rest easy knowing his blindside remains secure. Williams, now 37 and still playing at an elite level, has no plans to retire. He’s under contract through 2026 after signing a three-year, $82.66 million extension and has expressed interest in playing into his 40s.As the 49ers prepare for the 2025 season, both Purdy and Williams enter with full health and high hopes. And if Williams' smile is any indication, the team’s belief in their quarterback is stronger than ever.Also Read: ""She makes everything easier"": Josh Allen’s romantic line after marrying Hailee Steinfeld proves he’s winning both on and off the field","Brock Purdy signed a five-year, $265 million contract extension with the San Francisco 49ers.

After trading Luka Doncic in February, Dallas appears keen on adding another international star to bolster their roster.Lauri Markkanen, a $46 million All-Star, has been a consistent trade rumor candidate during his time with the Utah Jazz . Despite Utah’s reluctance to move him in previous seasons, another underwhelming campaign might push them to reconsider.As Ivan White of the Sporting News notes in the original report: ""Utah has been unwilling to involve him in serious trade talks over the past couple of years, but another season of uncompetitive basketball might have been enough to change its mind.""Dallas has multiple pathways to acquire the Finnish forward:- Mavericks Receive: Lauri Markkanen- Jazz Receive: P.J. Washington, Daniel Gafford, Caleb Martin, Jaden HardyWhile Lauri Markkanen’s value is high, his hefty salary complicates trade negotiations.

Buffalo Bills share 17 seconds of Josh Allen from Bills 2025 Media Day

Also Read:





Peek-a-boo! Sneak-peek! Into the Buffalo Bills’ handsome-handsome star quarterback Josh Allen’s insane aura! Is there a better-looking quarterback than him? No, right! Especially the glow that comes after a wedding? Mr. Steinfeld now. The official X account of the Buffalo Bills shared a few ravishing snapshots of their leading man, and fans have been gushing over him ever since! But wait, with that handsome face? All their focus went to the new, new wedding ring! And let’s zoom & enhance on that finger - wrote a fan and shared a closeup view of the wedding ring. For some, it’s silver. For many, it’s gold. But for Josh Allen? It’s a black wedding band! Why so? Let’s dig in to find out.Now, there could be many reasons for choosing a black wedding ring. The 2024 NFL season MVP probably chose a black wedding ring to signify strength, commitment, power, resilience, elegance, authority, mystery, maturity, wisdom, depth, transformation, and sophistication.Above all these heavy words, Josh Allen probably just wanted to have something that would be durable and require less maintenance than the high-on-maintenance gold and silver jewelry.If that sounds cheap, then maybe Allen just wanted to be different! Away from the crowd who fall for silver and gold wedding rings and adapt to the everyday norm of marriage. Oh, married? That silver/gold ring on the hand gave it away!If this too, sounds cliche, then the last guess would be - a black wedding ring goes with any and every attire! Allen might not have to think of the whole attire before wearing that wedding ring - if it were a gold or silver one, he’d have to match it with gold or silver attire or something subtly relating to them.But with a black wedding band? Right from casual to classy, from jersey to formal, from swimwear to pajamas - a black wedding ring goes with any and every apparel!The video is 17 seconds long. I see what you did there - noticed a fan! “17” is the jersey number of the 3-time Pro Bowler. But fans also observed that Josh Allen had the shortest honeymoon ever. The 29-year-old quarterback married the 28-year-old Sinners actress Hailee Steinfeld on May 31. And on June 10? He was back to work. “Short hunny moon” - wrote a fan. But other fans? They loved the fact that their NFL MVP was back to the gridiron. One wrote, “Newly wed Allen reporting for duty,” while another said, “We are so gonna win the Superbowl.” A third fan cheered on saying, “You're back to the regular logo. Thank you. Also, 17 is going to annihilate this year.”","NFL MVP Josh Allen opts for a black wedding ring over a silver or gold wedding ring - to signify power, strength, commitment, elegance, and resilience.

Kyrie Irving defends Karl-Anthony Towns amid staggering criticism







Although on-court rivals, Dallas Mavericks’ Kyrie Irving and New York Knicks standout Karl-Anthony Towns have been friends. Recently, Irving gave a shout-out to his brotherly pal Towns while slamming fans for the unending criticism directed at the Knicks superstar. The Knicks lost their championship dream following elimination by the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals, and after that, KAT was under immense criticism for his gameplay during the Eastern Conference Finals.Dallas Mavericks point guard/ shooting guard Kyrie Irving has had enough as he came out in defense of his friend Karl-Anthony Towns amid swirling criticism. “Y’all gotta stop making fun of my brother KA. I’m done with y’all. It’s so unfair,” Irving recently said.“So f***ing wrap, I’m letting y’all know, if you repost that shit again, meme him up, I’m attacking. Not like that physically, GTA, but Imma attack, alright?” the Mavs standout warned.“Y’all gotta leave KAT alone, okay? Cuz y’all don’t know what is like to grow up in Jersey and have all of these cultures that you are a part of, trust me on that. Jersey is literally, 130 miles long, it is very very small state.But when I get back to my point, I’m just sayin’, leave him alone, alright? Because he’s Dominican, he’s black, he grew up in certain area in Jersey, just like me, and you gotta survive out here. You have many different demographics of people, so, you gotta survive out here,” he added.Irving continued, “I don’t agree all the time when he be changing up his tone sometime, I don’t always agree on all of those s*it, you know what I mean, that’s should be funny. But on a serious note, he is my brother and I will protect him all the time.”Karl-Anthony Towns has taken serious heat after the Knicks’ playoff run ended in five games against the Pacers. While he did struggle on defense, especially in key moments, Towns still showed up when it mattered with strong rebounding and clutch offense late in games. That hasn’t stopped fans and media from making him the top target for blame in New York.Tensions grew after The Athletic reported that some Knicks teammates had frustrations with Towns throughout the season. Despite playing a big role in getting New York to the Eastern Conference Finals, the criticism has only fueled talk of a possible trade.Also Read: Vanessa Bryant stuns courtside in fiery red ensemble during NYC WNBA outing with daughters As for the Mavericks, the team took a major hit when All-Star guard Kyrie Irving tore his ACL in March.

It was in 2018 when the Seattle Seahawks settled on Michael Dickson as their punter. He was a fifth-round 149th overall pick. But that’s not of any concern at the moment. The fact that they signed a four-year contract worth $2.75 million in May 2018 - came crossing a mountain in June 2021 - is of concern! The four-year contract extension in 2021 became $14.7 million from $2.75 million! And now? The same four-year contract extension became $16.2 million! The third time’s a charm? Looks like it for Michael Dickson! But for the Seattle Seahawks fans? They find it to be exorbitant! One fan wrote - All that money to a punter? Fools @Seahawks! Another said - $16M to the punter.

One fan wrote - Jacksonville and Seattle competing to see who's the sorriest team on their coast.Jacksonville Jaguars announced their punter Logan Cooke’s four-year contract extension worth $16 million on June 9. And on June 10? The Seattle Seahawks extended their punter Michael Dickson with a four-year contract extension worth $16.2 million!By $0.2 million, Dickson defeated Cooke and became the highest-paid punter in the NFL! And the most surprising part? Their paths have been the same all along! Find it hard to believe? Hear us out.Logan Cooke was drafted by the Jaguars in 2018, and so was Dickson by the Seahawks in 2018! Cooke signed a four-year deal worth $2.531 million with the Jaguars, and so did Dickson with the Seahawks - a four-year deal worth $2.75 million! Both of them received a four-year-long contract extension in 2021! Their amounts differed. Logan acquired $12 million, whereas Michael received $14.7 million.But in 2025? Their contract extensions came so close! Leaving them apart for 24 hours alone! 29-year-old Logan Cooke was the highest-paid punter in the NFL on June 9 for bagging a bank-breaking deal worth $16 million!But on June 10? 29-year-old Michael Dickson became the highest-paid punter in the NFL because he signed a $16.2 million contract extension deal! Talk about real competition between players more than the competition between teams! No wonder a fan commented - Punter week I guess.Brady Henderson of ESPN reported that the extension is worth $16.2 million with $10.2 million guaranteed and a max value of $16.7 million.Through his seven NFL seasons with the Seattle Seahawks, Michael Dickson accumulatedpunts,punting yards,punting average, longest punt -, and inside 20 -! There isn’t a single accolade that this punter has not achieved, no wonder the fans love him so much! 1-time First-team All-Pro, 1-time Pro Bowl, 1-time PWFA All-Rookie Team, 1-time Ray Guy Award, 1-time Unanimous All-American, 1-time Second-team All-American, 2-time Big 12 Special Teams Player of the Year, and, and, and 2-time First-team All-Big 12.A punter’s job is to kick(punt) the NFL Duke to the opposite team when the offense fails to gain 10 yards in three attempts.

What does Shubman Gill's horoscope say about his captaincy future

Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has criticised the squad selected for the upcoming Champions Trophy 2025 by the hosts, calling it “a political selection” and blaming the national selection committee for making controversial decisions.In the squad announced on Friday, all-rounder Faheem Ashraf made a surprise return after almost two years on the sidelines, a decision Latif finds questionable.""It seems a political selection,"" Latif told Telecomeasia.net. ""Faheem has no recent performance to warrant a selection, and his record isn't impressive.""Ashraf’s ODI record includes 26 wickets in 34 ODIs at an average of 46.30, while his batting figures in 24 innings stand at a mere 10.66 average with a highest score of 28.Latif pointed out that Pakistan had successfully experimented with new players during their recent tours of Australia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa but opted against retaining them. ""This squad includes players like Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman , and Saud Shakeel, who were not part of the system on the last three tours. Now, it is up to captain Mohammad Rizwan to select the best XI, just as Imran Khan did in 1992 and Younis Khan in 2009,"" he said.Latif also backed Babar Azam’s move to open the innings but raised concerns about Pakistan’s bowling attack. ""I think Babar will be useful as an opener, but the main issue is who will take wickets in the 11-20 and 31-40 over phases. That has been Pakistan’s weakness, as we suffered in the 2023 World Cup in those areas.""Former Pakistan fast bowler Tanvir Ahmed went even further, calling the squad ""a joke.""""We have selected a squad that is a joke in our conditions,"" Tanvir told Telecomeasia.net. ""Look at India, they have four quality spinners in Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, and Axar Patel. And we? Just one spinner in Abrar Ahmed .""Tanvir accused the selectors of favoritism, saying, ""This is a squad picked on perchi (recommendations), and for that, the selection committee must take responsibility. There was no need to change the squad that performed well on the last three tours.""Pakistan will kick off their Champions Trophy campaign against New Zealand in Karachi on February 19, followed by a high-profile clash against India in Dubai on February 23.

Gulf Giants returned to winning ways with a commanding seven-wicket victory over the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders in the ILT20 at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium on Saturday. The win propelled the Giants to third place in the standings, strengthening their playoff chances, while ensuring MI Emirates joined Desert Vipers in the playoffs.Desperate for a win to stay in contention, the Giants produced a clinical bowling display, restricting the Knight Riders to a modest 123 for 7.Their chase was anchored by a crucial 70-run stand between Gerhard Erasmus and Tom Curran , with a finishing flourish from Shimron Hetmyer The Giants made a steady start before David Willey turned the game momentarily, dismissing James Vince and Jordan Cox in consecutive deliveries. With the scoreboard reading 27/2 after the powerplay, the pressure was on the Giants as Willey and Sunil Narine kept things tight. By the 10-over mark, they had crawled to 50/2.Momentum shifted in the 11th over as Curran went after Andre Russell, smashing a four, a six, and another four to collect 17 runs. This gave the Giants the push they needed, as they plundered 12 more off Terrance Hinds’ next over. Sitting comfortably at 82/2 with seven overs left, the chase was well under control.Erasmus fell to Jason Holder in the 15th over, but Hetmyer’s arrival ensured no late hiccups. A boundary off his first few balls, coupled with extras from Narine, eased the chase. Hetmyer then launched a massive six off Irbar Ahmad and struck the winning runs to seal a dominant victory.Earlier, Abu Dhabi Knight Riders had a nightmare start, losing both Kyle Mayers and Andries Gous inside the first three overs. They struggled to 3/2 before Roston Chase’s brief resistance took them to 24/2 at the end of the powerplay. Chase fell for 15, bringing Willey to the crease, who formed a 29-run stand with Joe Clarke.However, scoring remained tough, and the Knight Riders were stuck at 55/3 after 12 overs when Clarke fell to Chris Jordan. Russell’s arrival sparked a brief revival, with Willey smashing two sixes and Russell adding a couple of boundaries. But Curran removed Russell for 9, leaving the Knight Riders at 80/5 with five overs left.Willey tried to push the total with a six off Mark Adair but was dismissed the next ball after a valuable 41 off 29 deliveries. Local talent Alishan Sharafu attempted a late surge but found little support as the Knight Riders managed just three boundaries in the last four overs, finishing at 123/7.Abu Dhabi Knight Riders captain Sunil Narine acknowledged the tough conditions: “I think they bowled brilliantly and used the conditions to their advantage. We tried to take as many wickets as possible in the powerplay. We couldn't take many in the middle overs, and it became easier for them.”Player of the match Dan Worrall praised his team’s bowling unit: “Opening the bowling with Mark, we had to get us off to a good start. Our bowling group prides itself on diversity - left-arm, right-arm, tall and short, we have a bit of everything. We’re glad that we’ve at least given ourselves a fighting chance.”With the win, the Gulf Giants remain in the playoff hunt, while the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders face an uphill battle to stay in contention.","Gulf Giants returned to winning ways with a commanding seven-wicket victory over the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders in the ILT20 at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium on Saturday.

Buttler's 'We're going to play 12 as well' jibe sets the stage for fifth T20I showdown

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

MUMBAI: A justified sense of England feeling robbed offers context to a dead rubber as the resentful visitors take on hosts India in the fifth and final T20I at the Wankhede today.India have already taken an unassailable 3-1 lead in the series, thanks to their controversial 15-run win in the fourth game in Pune on Friday.That was after match referee and former Indian pacer Javagal Srinath curiously allowed the home team to field pacer Harshit Rana as a concussion substitute for all-rounder Shivam Dube , whose bowling is his weaker wing.England skipper Jos Buttler 's smile did a terrible job of masking his anger at the post-match media duties. ""It is not a like-for-like replacement. We don't agree with that,"" Buttler said after India completed a 15-run win.""Either Shivam Dube has put on about 25mph with the ball or Harshit has really improved his batting. We should have gone on to win the match, but we disagree with the decision,"" he added.While admitting that it was not the only factor in England losing, Buttler chose to twist the dagger further into the Indian team's conscience, by joking, ""Maybe at the toss next game, I'll say we're going to play 12 as well.""This fascinating subplot aside, India, despite having the series in their bag, would want to address some key issues. Like the form and returns of opener and wicketkeeper Sanju Samson and skipper Surya Kumar Yadav (SKY).Samson, who has scored just 35 runs in four games and has been out pulling the short ball on each occasion, thanks to his trigger movement of shuffling outside leg stump and back, will like to play an impactful innings. His glovework was also patchy in Pune and repeated failures won't cut ice with the selectors as India are blessed with many options for both the opening position as well as the wicket-keeping slot.SKY too needs to deliver. Captaining India for the first time on his home turf may just be the spur that he needs. He has led in the IPL once here when he captained Mumbai Indians to victory against Kolkata Knight Riders in April 2023.SKY's last significant knock was against Bangladesh in Hyderabad in Oct 2024 when he made 75. His returns in the last eight games read an embarrassing 21, 4, 1, DNB, 0, 12, 14, 0.The Wankhede, with its truer bounce and inviting short boundaries, could offer a welcome ticket to form for the skipper.The venue is also one of Buttler's happy hunting grounds especially in the IPL where he has scored 700 runs in 21 games with a ton and three half-centuries at an average of 36.84 and a strike-rate of 146.75. What he will appreciate more is the fact that in white-ball cricket, spin is not a factor, especially under lights because of heavy dew. His batters have been woeful against spin.This may trigger a change in tactics from India too. They know now that the accidental injection of pace in the form of Harshit in the last game enabled them to break their pattern of relying excessively on spin. He also offered the reliable Arshdeep Singh some support.With the series done, will India choose to rest Arshdeep and pick Mohammed Shami to enable the team and support staff to pump in more miles in the legs of the veteran seamer before the ODI series and the Champions Trophy?Champion sides find ways to win by increasing the difficulty quotient. Defending a target in dewy conditions should be the goal for the hosts, keeping the 2026 T20 WC in mind.","India have already taken an unassailable 3-1 lead in the series, thanks to their controversial 15-run win in the fourth game in Pune on Friday.

'I'm really enjoying the cricket': Brevis after MI Cape Town dominate high-scoring SA20 clash

Durban's Super Giants ended their Season 3 campaign on a high note with an exciting 11-run DLS victory over Joburg Super Kings at the Wanderers on Saturday. The result confirmed JSK's fourth-place finish in the group stage standings, setting up a crucial Eliminator clash against third-placed Sunrisers Eastern Cape at Centurion on Wednesday (February 5). Heinrich Klaasen provided a spectacular batting display for DSG, thrilling the visiting fans with an unbeaten 76 off 47 balls, featuring three fours and six towering sixes. In doing so, Klaasen etched his name in the history books as the first batter to surpass 1000 runs in SA20 .Klaasen was well supported by Kane Williamson, who contributed 22 runs in a 64-run partnership off 43 balls. Later, Wiaan Mulder played a key role with a steady 30 not out, adding an unbroken 70-run stand with Klaasen to push DSG to a competitive 173/4.JSK's Lutho Sipamla was the pick of the bowlers, delivering an impressive four-over spell, conceding just 24 runs and dismissing Australian allrounder Marcus Stoinis.However, Joburg's chase faced an unexpected hurdle when rain interrupted play, with the home team at 31/1 after 3.1 overs. Following a lengthy delay, play resumed with a revised target of 147 from 16 overs.After the restart, JSK struggled to find momentum, with DSG's young leg-spinner Noor Ahmad producing a match-defining spell of 3/25. DSG also handed rookie CJ King his SA20 debut, and the youngster made an instant impact by dismissing England's white-ball champion Moeen Ali.Despite these setbacks, Donovan Ferreira launched a fierce counterattack, smashing the fastest half-century of the season off just 21 balls. His explosive innings of 51 off 22 deliveries, including two fours and five sixes, brought JSK within striking distance, reducing the equation to 17 runs off the final four balls.However, DSG's Dwaine Pretorius held his nerve under immense pressure, dismissing Ferreira and Sipamla off successive deliveries to seal the win.The victory marked a strong finish to DSG's campaign, while JSK now turn their attention to a must-win Eliminator battle against Sunrisers Eastern Cape.","DSG beat Joburg Super Kings by 11 runs at the Wanderers on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: The penultimate round of the 87th Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 on Saturday witnessed a series of impressive results for the Indian contingent in Wijk aan Zee.In a commanding performance, R Praggnanandhaa secured his sixth win of the tournament, defeating Serbia’s Alexey Sarana with the white pieces.Playing an Indian Game with an all-pawn opening, Pragg transitioned into a Queen’s Gambit Declined.Sarana, showing early aggression, captured a couple of Pragg’s pieces.However, having the advantage of the first move, Pragg dictated the pace of the game. When Sarana miscalculated with Nb5 on his 21st move, the Indian grandmaster capitalised with a crucial Nxa6+ on move 22, seizing control.From that point, Sarana could only make desperate attempts to salvage the position. Pragg delivered the final blow on move 29 (Qb7+), forcing Sarana into resignation before the game reached 30 moves.Round 12 also brought an unexpected twist, as Arjun Erigaisi, who had struggled with both health and form throughout the tournament, secured his first win of the Tata Steel Masters 2025. Incredibly, his victim was Nodirbek Abdusattorov , the Uzbek grandmaster who had remained unbeaten until this encounter.The game, featuring the Nimzo-Indian Defence, saw multiple exchanges across the board. Playing with composure rather than aggression, Arjun capitalised on Abdusattorov’s Qg5 blunder on the 24th move. With Arjun’s g4 pawn attacking the Uzbek’s queen, Abdusattorov was forced into retreat.Although a misstep from Arjun on move 32 (Rxc6) momentarily gave Abdusattorov the upper hand, the Indian quickly recovered with precise queen and bishop manoeuvres. When Arjun captured Abdusattorov’s rook with Qxb8, the Uzbek resigned.Before this defeat, Abdusattorov had been a serious contender for the Masters title, keeping pace with Gukesh and Praggnanandhaa at the top of the leaderboard. The loss now leaves him behind the two Indians with a score of 7.5/12.In the longest game of Round 12 Masters, Gukesh Dommaraju let a winning position slip, settling for a draw against 2021 Tata Steel Masters champion Jorden van Foreest.Defending with Black, Gukesh played against a Queen’s Gambit Declined setup. A few misplaced knight and bishop moves put him in early trouble, but he recovered momentum through sharp queen play—only to blunder it away with 47. Rf7. With the game reaching a deadlock, Gukesh agreed on a draw.Elsewhere, Indian GM Leon Luke Mendonca held top seed Fabiano Caruana to a hard-fought draw, while Pentala Harikrishna also split points with Germany’s Vincent Keymer. Notably, both Harikrishna and Keymer were part of Gukesh’s preparation team for the World Chess Championship match against Ding Liren of China.Meanwhile, Dutch No. 1 Anish Giri extended his unbeaten streak to 11 matches, drawing against defending Masters champion Wei Yi of China. Vladimir Fedoseev, who had lost to Mendonca in Round 11, bounced back with a win over Dutch GM Max Warmerdam.ALSO SEE: Tata Steel Chess 2025 Schedule In the Challengers section, 11-year-old Argentinian prodigy Faustino Oro defeated 14-year-old Lu Miaoyi of China in a thrilling battle of young talents.

NEW DELHI: England captain Jos Buttler disagreed with India's brilliant move of using Harshit Rana as a concussion replacement for half-centurion Shivam Dube , which allowed the hosts to win the fourth game of the five-match T20I series in Pune on Friday by a margin of 15 runs.After Dube, who scored 53 from 34 balls, was struck on the helmet by a delivery from Jamie Overton in the 19.5th over, the concussion procedure was implemented.""We don't agree with concussion substitute . It's not a like for like replacement,"" Jos Buttler said at the post match media conference.Ultimately, Rana played a crucial role, taking three wickets, including Liam Livingstone 's, and Buttler questioned if the concussion regulation was actually adhered to.Buttler was sarcastic in calling out the dummy sold by India.""I think either Shivam Dube put on 25 mph with the ball or Harshit Rana has improved a lot with his batting,"" the skipper said.A like-for-like replacement is permitted by the concussion protocol, and Rana was a rapid substitute for medium pacer Dube, who CSK use as an impact player in the IPL.For the record, Rana does have a Ranji Trophy hundred.All they did, according to Indian bowling coach Morne Morkel , was assign a name to match referee Javagal Srinath.""We only gave a name to match referee. After that it's out of our hands. Harshit was having dinner. He had to quickly get up and go out. I thought he did an excellent job,"" Morkel said.India has long been adept in using the gray area of like-for-like replacement in the case of concussion substitutes.India last employed the strategy in a T20I match against Australia during the 2020-21 series.Yuzvendra Chahal took Ravindra Jadeja 's place as a concussion substitute after the former was struck only on the head and his hamstring became more of a problem.Getting the best of both worlds-Dube's batting and Rana's pace-was Friday's move.","India used Harshit Rana as a concussion replacement for half-centurion Shivam Dube.

Brief scores:

NEW DELHI: When Delhi batter Yash Dhull's struggles at the crease finally ended an hour into the second day's play against Railways on Friday morning, the Ferozeshah Kotla crowd erupted in joy. It was time for the main act. Virat Kohli marched out to the middle - to bat in a Ranji Trophy game for the first time in over 12 y ears - to loud chants of ""Kohli, Kohli"" and ""RCB, RCB"".However, the thousands who had turned up were left disappointed as Kohli's stay at the crease didn't long.After facing 15 balls and hitting one cracking boundary down the ground, Himanshu Sangwan 's gentle inswinger sent Kohli's offstump cartwheeling. India's star batter trudged off after having scored just six runs, his head bowed, while Sangwan indulged in some animated celebrations. The crowd was stunned into silence. The show was over. The stadium was almost empty by the time Kohli could walk up to the pavilion.It didn't matter that Delhi captain Ayush Badoni played a thrilling knock of 99 off 77 and allrounder Sumit Mathur remained unbeaten on 78 at stumps to take Delhi to 334/7 in reply to Railways' first-innings score of 241. The few who had stayed back thronged the fencing next to the pavilion where Kohli was seated in the balcony, their eyes fixed firmly on him.Meanwhile, social media had gone into a tizzy, as usual, with Kohli fans hurling abuses at 29-year-old Sangwan, who incidentally made his Delhi U-19 debut along with Rishabh Pant The Railways bowler had been promoted to the post of a senior ticket examiner before the match, but knocking Kohli over will be etched in his memory forever.It may just be an inconsequential domestic match, but Kohli's problems against the moving ball around the off stump are real. The Railways seamers were, at best, bowling military-medium pace, but they didn't deviate from the plan of sticking to a line and length with the newish ball. Kohli had been beaten twice on the outside edge by Kunal Yadav in the previous over.The distinct lack of pace teased Kohli. Then ego got the better of him and he started walking towards the ball. It paid off when he shimmied down and smacked Sangwan straight down the ground for a boundary. It wasn't a classical straight drive. It was a quintessential T20 smack. Next ball, he saw the off stump flying behind him from almost halfway down the pitch.Railways 241 all out vs Delhi 334/7 in 96 overs (Ayush Badoni 99, Pranav Rajvanshi 39, Sumit Mathur 78 not out; Himanshu Sangwan 2/46, Kunal Yadav 2/82)",Virat Kohli's offstump cartwheels after being bowled by Himanshu Sangwan.

What does Shubman Gill's horoscope say about his captaincy future

NEW DELHI: India pacer Harshit Rana made history on Friday during the fourth match of the five-match T20I series against England, becoming the first player to make a T20I debut mid-match as a concussion substitute among full-member teams.Rana replaced all-rounder Shivam Dube, who was struck on the back of the head by a Jamie Overton delivery in the final over of India’s innings.While the move proved crucial in India’s 15-run victory, it also sparked an intense debate over the fairness of the substitution.Former England captain Michael Vaughan was among the most vocal critics, questioning whether Rana was a genuine ""like-for-like"" replacement for Dube. The decision became even more contentious after Rana claimed three wickets for 33 runs, playing a decisive role in restricting England to 166 while chasing India’s total of 181.""I have to say the substitute — how did they find that Harshit Rana is a like-for-like for Shivam Dube? An out-and-out bowler replacing a batter who can bowl some part-time stuff is beyond me,"" Vaughan said while speaking on Cricbuzz. ""He gets three for 33, key wickets at the key times… You can’t sell me that Harshit Rana is a like-for-like replacement for Shivam Dube.""India’s move was also scrutinised by former India pacer Zaheer Khan , who acknowledged that while teams have the right to nominate a player, the match referee should have ensured that the replacement met the criteria.""Maybe Ramandeep [Singh] would have been the ideal choice,"" Zaheer said. ""The match referee’s role was to say, ‘Okay, you have nominated this player, but he doesn’t suit the criteria exactly, so suggest another player who is actually a batter who can bowl, rather than a bowler who can bat.’""Despite the controversy, India’s performance on the field was dominant. Hardik Pandya (53) and Dube (53) rescued the team from 79 for 5, forging an 87-run partnership that helped India post a competitive 181 for 9. In response, England faltered against India’s bowling attack, with Rana and leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi (3 for 56) leading the charge.The victory extended India’s unbeaten T20I series streak at home to 17 since 2019 and sealed a 3-1 series win over England. However, the debate surrounding Rana’s substitution is likely to continue, with calls for greater clarity in concussion replacement rules.","India pacer Harshit Rana made history on Friday during the fourth match of the five-match T20I series against England.

NEW DELHI: Not leaving anything to chance, India played it safe on Friday by picking its best-ranked players - Sasikumar Mukund and Ramkumar Ramanathan - for their Davis Cup World Group 1 Playoff tie against Togo.Mukund, the No. 1 singles player in Indian squad, will begin the campaign on Day 1 with a match against Liova Ayite Ajavon, while Ramkumar Ramanathan will play the only ranked player in the Togo side, Thomas Setodji.The second day will witness the doubles pair of N Sriram Balaji and Rithvik Bollipalli taking on the duo of Setodji and Isak Padio before Ramkumar and Mukund play the reverse singles.""In Davis Cup you can't take anything for granted. You've seen India have been unseeded and reached the finals. Similarly, we can't take (any chance) in this format which is World Group. It's a very merit-based system now. You have to be good to reach here. If they're playing the playoffs, I'm sure that they play at a good level,"" India's non-playing captain Rohit Rajpal told reporters.Giving the example of a conversation on Thursday, Rajpal reiterated that his side are not taking Togo lightly. ""One of our seniors mentioned on Thursday that India should look at 5-0. Their captain came right back and said don't take us for granted. We're here to win.""Mukund, world No. 365, meanwhile said he was looking forward to the match for some redemption, having crashed out against Morocco in Lucknow with injury on his Davis Cup debut in 2023.

I can get past the finish line and give the team what they are expecting from me,"" Mukund said.Doubles specialist Bollipalli said it was a ""dream come true"" for being given the chance to make his Davis Cup debut on Saturday. ""It's very exciting. It's a dream come true for me to play in Davis Cup. But I'm just going to treat it like any other match that I play as I don't want to give it any special preference.

Replacing a big-hitting batting all-rounder, who has bowled one over in the [2024] IPL, with a bowler who can't bat and bowls heavy seam, makes no sense to me whatsoever.""England still really should have won the game. They probably would have rather faced a pace bowler than a spinner, to be honest, but I still don't understand it.""India have Washington Sundar on the bench, who Dube replaced. but instead they bring in a heavy bowler, who bowls 140-odd [kmph].

PUNE: Pacer Harshit Rana, leggie Ravi Bishnoi and allrounders Shivam Dube and Hardik Pandya played starring roles as India won the fourth match of the T20I series against England on Friday, and with it the series.The home team now has a 3-1 lead following Friday's 15-run win at the Gahunje stadium, making the fifth and last match now inconsequential.Batting first, India made a competitive 181/9 after losing the toss and recovering from 12/3 after two overs. Then they restricted England to 166 for their 17th successive series win.The left-handed Dube, who came in for Washington Sundar, rode on his luck to score 53 (34b; 7x4, 2x6). He was dropped by Jos Buttler at slip off Adil Rashid before he had scored a run. Dube forged a vital partnership with Hardik Pandya (53 off 30b; 4x4, 4x6). After Dube was hit on the helmet, India managed to squeeze in a concussion substitute in paceman Rana.Harshit ended with figures of 3/33 to play a pivotal role in the game, but England should also blame themselves for some careless batting. They were 62-0 before losing three wickets for five runs.From 129-4 in the 15th over, England slipped to 146-8 after 17. The first blip was caused by Ben Duckett (39 off 19b; 7x4, 1x6), who was dealing in boundaries until he hit straight to Suryakumar Yadav at extra cover. The second came with Harry Brook's brain fade and resultant scoop off Varun Chakravarthy that ended in the hands of short fine-leg.Bishnoi (3/28) got Duckett in the Powerplay and left-armer Axar Patel removed Phil Salt the next over. Varun too did his bit with 2-28. Earlier, Hardik (53, 30b, 4x4s, 4x6s) and Dubey (53, 34b, 7x4s, 2x6s) went berserk from the 16th to the 18th over, the duo eventually putting on 87 runs off 44 balls for the sixth wicket.Hardik treated speedster Jofra Archer with disdain, clearing the ground cleanly. He also hit a breathtaking four between the tiny gap of straightened long off and deep widish long-off. He hit waist high full toss no-ball off Jamie Overton for four in the 18th over.Dube slogged, hoicked and punched boundaries and then came up with a Natraj pose four off Overton. Together, they scored 53 off 17 balls starting from the 16th over, with four fours and four sixes. The preceding 17 balls had given India just 27 runs. India's top order was not willing to gauge the pace and bounce of the wicket or the strategy of England bowlers, and they paid the price.Earlier, pacer Saqib Mahmood , who came in for Mark Wood, had a three wicket maiden in the innings' second over. Leg-spinner Adil Rashid, introduced in the eighth over, came up with another masterly exhibition of variations in speed, line and length.Dube, meanwhile, slogged, hoicked and punched boundaries and then came up with an excellent four off Overton.",India beat England by 15 runs to take a 3-1 lead in the T20 series.

NEW DELHI: After a terrible start, India's captain Suryakumar Yadav praised his team's tenacity, giving Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube credit for leading the innings to a respectable total as they defeated England by 15 runs in the fourth Twenty20 International on Friday in Pune.In the second over, India were at 12/3, but Pandya and Dube kept the innings together and led the home team to 181/9.""We didn't want to go back after 12/3. Three wickets in one over was too much. The way Hardik and Dube showed their experience was great,"" Suryakumar said after India's 15-run win.Highlighting India's intent, the India skipper said: ""This is one thing we've been talking about -- expressing yourself and batting the same way as in the nets. I think we are moving in the right direction.""But in the last over, Dube was hit on the helmet and removed, making space for Harshit Rana's surprising but ideal T20I debut.""I knew we could control the game after the powerplay. We picked a few wickets. Post drinks, Harshit Rana came in as the third seamer and delivered,"" Suryakumar said.With an incredible three-wicket haul, Rana took advantage of the situation.""It is still a dream debut for me. When Dube came back, after two overs I was informed I will be the concussion substitute ,"" Rana said.The young pacer disclosed that he had been training for this chance for a long time prior to the series.""I have been preparing for a while, not just for this series. I have been waiting for this moment [his debut] to prove myself. When I got the chance, I did not think of the circumstances and just thought about delivering. I have experience of bowling at the death [for KKR in the IPL] and relied on that,"" Rana said.England captain Jos Buttler acknowledged that his team squandered the opportunity after a solid start and said they were unable to build on the early breakthroughs.""We started brilliantly, taking wickets in the powerplay and we were in a great position at the end of the batting powerplay. We should have gone onto win the game.He pointed out England's major mistakes, such as a costly missed catch.""...We dropped Dube first ball and he went to play a really good innings.

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Eastern Cape (SEC) dominated Paarl Royals (PR) by 48 runs in the 28th match of the SA20, 2025, on Saturday, securing a crucial bonus point win ahead of their upcoming Eliminator clash against JSK.After winning the toss, SEC opted to bat first and posted a total of 148/8 in their 20 overs. Key contributions came from Jordan Hermann (53) and Tristan Stubbs (43).Despite a strong start, with SEC reaching 80 after 10 overs, their innings faltered due to a top-order collapse. Tony de Zorzi , David Bedingham, and Aiden Markram all fell to the bowling of Bjorn Fortuin and Mitchell Owen.“Look, I think from the start we had where we had 80 after 10 and we’re in a good position. We’re thinking we’ve got to get over 160 because we started off really well at the start of the game,"" caoch Russell Domingo said after the match.“We’re also probably looking at 150 to 160 because that’s the nature of the pitchers in George’s Park. So probably 10 or 15 short of where we should have been. But yeah, you're never going to play the perfect game and really happy with the way we started today because we haven’t had good starts over the last couple of weeks and today was a really good start and some big improvements.""Despite the middle-order resistance, including Liam Dawson’s firm stand, SEC ended with a subpar total. Fortuin, Malinga, and Owen were the standout bowlers for Paarl, each picking up two wickets.In response, Paarl Royals’ chase crumbled under the pressure of SEC’s seamers. Craig Overton and Marco Jansen tore through the top order, reducing Paarl to 22/5 inside four overs.Although Rubin Hermann (35) and Andile Phehlukwayo (22) tried to rebuild, Aiden Markram’s double strike, including a brilliant catch by Overton, sealed the fate of Paarl. They were bowled out for 100 in 18.2 overs.Jansen and Overton each claimed three wickets, sealing a comprehensive victory for SEC.

NEW DELHI: Liverpool on Saturday secured a 2-0 victory at Bournemouth with Mohamed Salah 's disputed penalty, extending their lead to nine points in the Premier League The opening goal came through Salah's penalty after Cody Gakpo appeared to fall over his own feet rather than from Lewis Cook's challenge.The decision sparked outrage from Bournemouth after referee Darren England's initial call was supported by VAR.""The referee's call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR – with the challenge deemed to have been a trip by Cook on Gakpo. The VAR also confirmed Gakpo was onside in the build-up,"" the Premier League said in a statement.Salah later scored his second goal in the match, further extending Liverpool's advantage over Arsenal in second place.The Egyptian forward has now scored 21 goals in 23 league appearances this season, achieving the 20-goal milestone for the fifth time in his Premier League career.With 178 Premier League goals, Salah has moved ahead of Frank Lampard into sixth place on the all-time scoring list.Liverpool have not lost in 19 league matches, winning 17 of their 23 games since Arne Slot took over from Jurgen Klopp before the season began.Liverpool, pursuing their 20th title and first since 2020, await the outcome of Manchester City's match against Arsenal on Sunday.They face Tottenham in the League Cup semi-final second leg on Thursday, trying to overcome a 1-0 deficit.The only concern for Slot was an injury to England right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold in the second half.Bournemouth's impressive season included home victories over Manchester City and Arsenal, plus a 5-0 win against Nottingham Forest last week.Their 11-game unbeaten league run ended against a determined Liverpool side.The match began dramatically when Alexander-Arnold lost possession to Antoine Semenyo after 12 seconds, requiring a save from Alisson Becker.Alexander-Arnold's defensive struggles continued as his poor clearance allowed Justin Kluivert through on goal before Alisson made another save.Semenyo managed to evade two defenders and hit the woodwork with a powerful shot.Liverpool showed their attacking prowess with Kepa Arrizabalaga saving Dominik Szoboszlai's attempt.The controversial opening goal came in the 30th minute when Cook appeared to make no contact with Gakpo before the penalty was given.Salah converted the penalty with confidence despite the controversy.Bournemouth's immediate response through David Brooks was ruled offside by VAR.Alisson continued his impressive performance by denying Semenyo in a one-on-one situation.The match saw more VAR involvement with checks for Alexander-Arnold's handball and Alexis Mac Allister's potential second yellow card for fouling Brooks.Marcus Tavernier hit the post with a long-range effort before Kluivert missed the rebound opportunity.Salah sealed the victory in the 75th minute, receiving Curtis Jones' pass and finishing skillfully past Kepa.",Liverpool beat Bournemouth 2-0 in Premier League.

Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane has criticised Marcus Rashford , stating that the forward ""must be ashamed"" of his current situation under manager Ruben Amorim .The 27-year-old has not played for United in seven weeks, and Amorim has made it clear that Rashford ""has to change"" if he wants to have a future at Old Trafford. Despite training with the squad ahead of Thursday's Europa League match against Romanian side FCSB, Rashford was left out of the traveling squad.With the transfer window closing at 23:00 GMT on Monday, Rashford has been linked with a potential loan move to Barcelona, but time is running out to finalize a deal.Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane expressed his frustration over Rashford’s situation:""I can't get involved in the conversation, I still can't understand at any level. Whatever's going on with players leaving, months left on contracts, a player who doesn't train properly... I don't understand it.You might as well leave me out of this conversation. Especially if you think he wants to move, which is more of a reason to train properly so when you go to a new club you're up to speed and when you leave the club at least you showed a decent attitude. He must be ashamed.""Fellow United legend Wayne Rooney also shared his thoughts, recalling a recent visit to United’s Carrington training facility :""I went into Carrington on Sunday to take my kids to game day, and Marcus Rashford was out on the training pitch with the fitness coach, but he was right over towards where the parents were walking past for the kids' games.I looked at him thinking how embarrassing it must be for him as parents walk past.""Rooney admitted he had spoken to Rashford and advised him to leave Manchester United in order to revive his career:""I've spoken to Marcus a couple of times and I've given him my thoughts and feelings that he needs to leave the football club because whatever is going on in his life and at Manchester United, he's not the same. For him to have a fresh start, he needs to leave the club.""A product of United’s youth academy, Rashford has scored 138 goals in 426 appearances for the club, including seven goals in 24 games this season. However, a potential move remains complicated due to his reported £300,000-a-week ($374,000) contract, which runs until 2028.",Marcus Rashford has not played for Manchester United in seven weeks.

Here's a look at some of the numbers that tell the story of how the first season in the new-look format has gone:144: The number of games in the 36-team league phase, up from 96 last year in the old 32-team group format.3.27: Goals per game in the new format, up from 3.09 per game in last season's group stage.9: Barcelona 's Robert Lewandowski and Borussia Dortmund's Serhou Guirassy are joint top scorers with nine goals each.28: The number of goals scored by Barcelona, six more than any other team in the league phase. Manchester City led the way last season with 28 goals in their entire Champions League campaign, including knockout games.7: Liverpool's winning streak stopped at seven games with a 3-2 loss at PSV Eindhoven. That loss meant there were no unbeaten teams in the league phase. Six teams qualified unbeaten from their groups last season.23: The number of games won by a margin of four goals or more. Bayern Munich's 9-2 win over Dinamo Zagreb on the opening night set the tone as one-sided games were more common. Last year only four group games were won by four goals or more. Having goal difference as the primary tiebreaker - unlike last year - gave stronger teams an incentive to run up the score.0: The number of teams from eastern Europe that reached the knockout rounds, despite the expanded format. Clubs from Croatia, Czech Republic, Serbia, Slovakia and Ukraine all finished outside the top 24. Zagreb was closest in 25th but missed out on goal difference despite upsetting AC Milan 2-1.

Edited excerpts:

How do you do this balancing act of coaching club and country?

Everyone says the mentality of an Indian footballer is not the same as in other countries. Do you agree?

It's been five years for you in India, the longest time you have spent outside your home country. What has your experience been like?

Now that you are the coach of the national team, what changes do you want to implement?

In India, cricket is a religion, so how do you see football cross that barrier?

Manolo Marquez is the first foreigner to take up the dual role of coaching an Indian football club, FC Goa, and the national team. In a free-wheeling chat during Townhall With The Times of India, the Indian football team coach opens up on his first impressions of the country, adapting to the ""Indian way"" of getting things done, while discussing the way forward for the beautiful game.I didn't expect to share both jobs. The beginning was more difficult because the national team had games in Sept, Oct and Nov and FC Goa had a bad start. People talk, but I always say all this noise (and criticism) is why I get paid. About the dual role, it's not normal, but it's not the first time either.I always joke that one day I will write a book on India and the title will be 'The Indian Mentality'. There is a lot of talent, but they don't know how to show this talent. There is no consistency (in performances).When I arrived here, the players that were very good in the first season disappeared in the second. Players who were very bad in the previous season, did very good in the next. You need consistency. I miss this in Indian football.Looking at the chaos (during the Covid-19 pandemic) on the first day I arrived in Mumbai, I asked myself, 'what are you doing here?' Then I landed in Goa (to be inside the biosecure bubble for ISL ), got inside the car and was astonished with the driving. I told the driver, 'Wow, you can be an incredible winger, you surpassed cars, dogs, cows, people.' It was completely crazy. I wanted to leave after 10 minutes. It's my fifth season now. India is an incredible country.The national team, at this moment, is less important. You need to focus on the grassroots. There is Vision 2047 (by the AIFF ), but if you don't start work immediately (on the grassroots), it will be Vision 2097. You need to do something as soon as possible because the talent is there. If you see U-13, U-15, U-17 players in FC Goa, maybe you will be surprised. There are better, or the same, players here like in Spain.But the (development) process is completely different. Here the focus is on studies, and they cannot attend (regular) training sessions because they have exams constantly. Then there are (travel) distances. When people ask me when India will play at the World Cup, I tell them this is the last question (anyone should be asking). You need to start from the bottom.In my opinion, football will never surpass cricket in India. Never. But in a country of 1.4 billion, there is space for more than one sport. What I do hate is when I am told that ISL must finish before IPL starts. I know a million more people will watch IPL cricket than ISL, but that's okay, if (football) is the second sport. Keep going, don't change fixtures. This is something India needs to improve. Maybe I am from another culture, another mentality. Here, everything is organised at the last moment, and then it's changed. You need a proper schedule. Now I have learnt a lot to improvise. Do it the Indian way.","Manolo Marquez is the first foreigner to take up the dual role of coaching an Indian football club, FC Goa, and the national team.

The Indian players faced little resistance from their African counterparts, making it a relatively one-sided contest witnessed by around 1,500 fans.With a 2-0 lead secured, India are well-positioned to seal their place in the World Group I on Sunday, when N Sriram Balaji and Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli take to the court for the third rubber.The Indian team's dominant performance on the opening day has put them in a commanding position to progress to the next stage of the competition.","Sasikumar Mukund and Ramkumar Ramanathan lead India to a commanding 2-0 lead against Togo in the World Group I play-off tie on Saturday.

India vs Togo

On Saturday:

On Sunday:

NEW DELHI: Sasikumar Mukund is set to make a significant return to the Davis Cup as India prepare to face Togo in the World Group I Play-off starting Saturday.Once hailed as a promising talent by tennis legend Leander Paes, Mukund's career faced setbacks due to injuries and controversies, including an unannounced suspension following his Davis Cup debut in September 2023.Now 28 and primarily training in Austria, Mukund is eager to secure his first Davis Cup victory in the absence of Sumit Nagal India enter the tie as firm favorites against the lower-ranked Togo team. Mukund will commence the singles matches against Liova Ayite Ajavon, while Ramkumar Ramanathan is set to face Thomas Setodji, who holds an ATP ranking of 1256.Despite the apparent disparity in rankings, Mukund remains cautious, reflecting on past experiences:""Morocco was not an easy experience and hopefully tomorrow is the chance to redeem myself, and I can get to the finish line. It has been a while since I played in Morocco and I am much fitter and a better player now. I have put in a lot of hard work, in general.""Togo has demonstrated resilience, winning 10 of their last 11 ties, though they have yet to face higher-caliber teams like India. Indian captain Rohit Rajpal emphasizes the importance of not underestimating the opposition:""It's a format based on merit. India had reached the final without being a seeded team. If they have reached the Playoffs, it means they have played at a good level.""In doubles, debutant Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli , who recently entered the top 100 in doubles rankings and competed in the Australian Open, will partner with N. Sriram Balaji. Balaji speaks highly of his partner:""Playing with Rithvik suits me. He will play on the deuce side and I on the ad court side. I like his work ethics. He is focused and disciplined, he works hard. I enjoy playing with him.""The tie presents a pivotal opportunity for Mukund to contribute to India's success and for the team to advance to World Group I in September.Sasikumar Mukund vs Liova Ayite AjavonRamkumar Ramanathan vs Thomas SetodjiN Sriram Balaji/Rithvik Bollipalli vs Thomas Steodji/ Hod'Abalo Isak PadioSasikumar Mukund vs Thomas SetodjiRamkumar Ramanathan vs Liova Ayite Ajavon.",Sasikumar Mukund set to make a significant return to the Davis Cup.

Davis Cup: India bank on home advantage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/davis-cup-india-bank-on-home-advantage/articleshow/117768187.cms,"Mukund rues lack of depth

NEW DELHI: Having played back-to-back Davis Cup away ties, the Indians are happy to be p laying their latest encounter at home. They hope to make the most of the home advantage when they play an untested Togo on the weekend.In 2022, they earned a promotion winning their home match against Denmark in the Capital before dropping down following a loss to Norway in the away game. They suffered another setback in 2023 losing the away encounter to Denmark before recovering with a win over Morocco in Lucknow. Last year too, they did well by beating Pakistan in Islamabad before again suffering reverses in another away tie against Sweden.""I think we played most of the ties away and somehow in Scandinavia, which was a joke amongst us. It looked like we're going to Scandinavia again this time too. So, from Finland (loss in 2021) to Sweden to Norway to Denmark, we've been everywhere,"" captain Rohit Rajpal said here on Thursday. ""We went and played in Pakistan too. So, we're really hoping that we get more ties (at home). You know, there's certainly an advantage when you play at home. There's no two ways about it.""Rajpal, a former Davis Cupper himself, said that despite being the higher-ranked team and having the home advantage, India are World No. 38 while Togo are No. 73, the hosts are not taking their rivals lightly. ""We could not get too much information about them online. So, we were waiting for them to show up here and will watch them carefully. They have beaten 10 teams on the trot and they are high on confidence,"" he said.""They're hitting the ball pretty good. We were a little surprised. They look quite talented as well. And a s far as chances are concerned, it's Davis Cup. We don't take anybody lightly. We've ourselves beaten some very, big and good teams. So that is part of Davis Cup. We are ready for everything, whatever comes our way.""Ramkumar Ramanathan added: ""We should just stick to our strengths and we should play to our capabilities and not think much about them. I think if we do that, we have a good chance.""India's top ranked player in this mix, Mukund Sasikumar , has a world ranking of 365. Ramkumar Ramanathan is world No. 406, Davis Cup debutant Karan Singh is 496. Sumit Nagal , who's not taking part in the tie, has the best ranking among the Indians at 102, having dropped out of top 100 recently. So it came as no surprise when Mukund said he's 'hurt' by the numbers. ""It hurts a little bit when I read or when I look at the numbers saying the No. 1 ranked player is 360. This depth is kind of disappointing because first I am an Indian tennis fan and then I am a player. So as a well-wisher of Indian tennis, this is not something that I really enjoy reading,"" Mukund said.""In the past I was 200 and something and I was No. 5 in India. That was so because so many guys were much ahead of me. God willing that depth is coming soon again.""","India have played back-to-back Davis Cup away ties. They hope to make the most of the home advantage when they play an untested Togo. India are World No. 38 while Togo are No. 73.

It's one thing to watch it on TV and another to watch the players live and see them perform under pressure from close. That makes a lot of difference to all the young players.""Rajpal also revealed that the venue will host an international event - the Delhi Open - next month. ""We have a Delhi Open coming which will bring players from 25 to 30 countries. These Indian Davis Cup players will be there. We're working on making it into a property that keeps growing.

Novak Djokovic v Alexander Zverev Highlights | Australian Open 2025 Semifinal

Rafael Nadal's uncle and former coach has joined others in questioning Novak Djokovic 's hamstring injury that led to his withdrawal from the Australian Open semi-final. Toni Nadal , who coached Rafael for almost 30 years, also addressed the crowd's reaction to Djokovic 's retirement.In his column for El Pais , Toni Nadal expressed concerns about Djokovic's decision to retire against Alexander Zverev without attempting a medical timeout during the match.The crowd at Rod Laver Arena , who had paid over $400 for tickets, responded with boos and jeers when Djokovic retired from the match.""I believe that a great champion like the Serbian, someone who has contributed to the most sublime pages in the history of tennis, should not leave any court in this way and, even less so Rod Laver Arena, where he holds the record for victories and titles,"" Nadal wrote.""Respect ... is well deserved in the difficult moment, leaving the court that has seen him win so many times. I understand that the public showed their disappointment and anger at being deprived of the expected spectacle after having paid an entrance fee for it.""Toni Nadal suggested that Djokovic's history of playing through injuries has been marked by theatrical displays.""Over the years, a certain suspicion has been fostered around Novak, due to his grimaces or histrionics, which has sown doubts about the veracity of his injuries,"" he stated.""Suspicions began in his quarter-final match against Carlos Alcaraz. After losing the first set, and with obvious gestures of pain, the Serbian made it clear to his opponent and the general public he would hardly be able to continue his match. But the reality was he not only faced the rest of the match with total normality, but he even ended up winning it. Against Zverev, he played the entire first set with apparent normality and without visible signs of pain until he decided to abandon it just after the German won the first set.""Following the match, Djokovic explained that he was ""upset"" about his worsening hamstring tear . He mentioned trying everything possible to manage the pain.Djokovic later shared an MRI image of his injured hamstring on social media to address skepticism about his condition.""When a player faces physical problems in a match of this nature, he normally waits until the end to decide to retire,"" Toni Nadal continued. ""He calls the physiotherapist, plays some games impaired and, only when he sees the inevitable fate, does he decide to retire. On more than one occasion we have seen Novak with similar performances, with facial gestures and body language that contradict what we are seeing on the court, and that sow certain doubts about the authenticity of his problems.""Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley had revealed in 2023 that Djokovic had won his tenth Melbourne Park title while dealing with a 3cm hamstring tear. However, athletes and medical experts disputed this claim.Toni Nadal's coaching career includes guiding Rafael to numerous major victories, including 10 Roland-Garros titles, one Australian Open, two Wimbledon championships, three US Open titles, and an Olympic gold medal. Their partnership lasted until 2017. He later spent three years coaching Canadian player Félix Auger-Aliassime.","Novak Djokovic retired mid-way into his Australian Open 2025 semi-final match with injury.

NEW DELHI: For tennis aficionados, the name Togo might not ring a bell. Few would bet on them to trouble India in the Davis Cup 2025 World Group Playoff match here on the weekend. But for their captain Ali Agnamba , who believes his team is in the middle of the best phase in two decades, it would be anything but a cakewalk. Agnamba has a point.Togo have reached this position the back of a 10-match winning streak - achieved by a group of young players who play their tennis abroad.It may sound a bit fanciful when he suggested that his team could beat India, but then he threw up numbers to support his belief.""When we played against Latvia in the last match, nobody expected us to win,"" he said referring to the World No.73 Togo's Davis Cup tie against World No. 46 Latvia. ""Even back home, people thought this was going to be the end. But the guys came together, they were like 'Oh, we want to win this. We're going to win'. And we surprised a lot of people. Even the Latvia players were surprised when we beat them 4-0.""India are ranked eight places above Latvia - at 38.The captain, a former Togolese Davis Cupper himself who migrated to the US years back and was in the coaching team that worked with the Williams sisters in their formative years, draws his confidence from the ability of the four-member team at his disposal. His team of players are based around the world and have been specially assembled for this journey - two from Paris, one from Nantes and the other from Atlanta, USA - not just to earn glory, but respect too.""The Williams sisters changed women tennis. If you have a female tennis player doing what they're doing now, is because of them. Because before, nobody had to go to the gym to get strong. Those girls came, they're so powerful that they force everybody to do a lot more,"" he said.They also changed mindset on race, reminded Agnamba. ""You know, when you're a person of colour, you're already 10 steps below before you can come up. You have to be the best of the best to get respect. Even that sometimes you may not.""Togo would be looking to inspire some of that respect over the weekend. ""Obviously we have four players here that all live in different parts of the world, but we have a way to communicate together through chat. And when there's a competition like this, we kind of figure out how each player can get ready individually, either by training or going to competition. And that's how the team has been performing for the past three years,"" said Agnamba, who admitted having a culture shock when he shifted base to the US 30 years back.In a bid to escape poverty and being able to pursue the sport, the players had to leave Togo seeking greener pastures abroad, but their loyalty remains firmly with the western African country. So, in the match against India, the objective was not just to have a better show in Davis Cup, but to inspire several others back home struggling to make ends meet. Tennis is the second-most followed sport in Togo, behind football.""When you grow up in developing countries, the opportunity is very small. And when you are good at any type of sport, I mean, since we're talking about tennis and the dream is always to get out of the country because once you get out, you have more opportunity to train, you have better equipment. And yeah, that's always been a dream to get out of the country, to have more opportunity.""So, the average kid that plays tennis back home, they're coming from very poor families, and you cannot be your best in Africa. You must get up. And I think for any African country that played in the Davis Cup, 90% of the players live overseas. In developing countries there are a lot of poor kids that use sport as a way to get out of the country to have a better life. And I'll tell you, 99% of the players that are able to compete for Togo come from very poor families. But the system that we have there, the federation helps the best players.""",Togo face India in the Davis Cup 2025 World Group Playoff match on the weekend.

NEW DELHI: India's top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has dropped out of the ATP top-100 rankings after a prolonged stint of 10 consecutive months.This setback comes on the heels of a string of underwhelming performances.Simultaneously, veteran doubles specialist Rohan Bopanna has slipped out of the top-20 rankings due to an early exit from the Australian Open, where he was defending a substantial number of points.Nagal had maintained his top-100 ranking since March 2024, initially breaking into the elite bracket in February of the same year on the back of a commendable showing at the season's first Grand Slam event.However, his recent struggles on the demanding Tour have been evident, with only three main draw victories across 18 tournaments since Wimbledon 2024.A top-100 ranking is highly coveted as it guarantees direct entries into major events, including Grand Slams, where even early-round exits can yield decent prize money.Sasikumar Mukund, Ramkumar Ramanathan, Karan Singh, and Aryan Shah are the other Indian singles players in the top-600 rankings.In the doubles realm, the 44-year-old Bopanna, still playing at a high level, has dropped five places to No. 21.As the defending champion at the Australian Open, he had to defend a significant number of points, but an opening-round exit with his new partner, Nicolas Barrientos, proved costly.Yuki Bhambri, N Sriram Balaji, Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli, and Arjun Kadhe are the other Indian doubles players in the top-100 rankings.Notably, Mukund, Ramkumar, Balaji, Karan Singh, and Bollipalli are part of the Indian Davis Cup squad set to face Togo in the World Group I Play-off tie on February 1-2, while Nagal and Bhambri have opted out of the match.",India's top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has dropped out of the ATP top-100 rankings.

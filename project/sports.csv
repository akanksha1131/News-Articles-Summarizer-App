India played poor cricket at the Eden Gardens | Don't blame the XI, players underperformed

South Africa are on the brink of a landmark Test series triumph in India after their 30-run win in the opening Test of the two-match contest. A draw in the upcoming second Test in Guwahati would be enough for Temba Bavuma 's side to seal the series. Their preparations, however, have been unsettled by an unexpected injury scare.As per a News18 report, Player of the Match Simon Harmer is dealing with a shoulder issue and left-arm pacer Marco Jansen is also nursing a niggle. Both players underwent medical tests on Tuesday at Woodlands Hospital in Kolkata, the same facility that treated Shubman Gill’s neck problem.The visitors have surged to second in the ICC World Test Championship standings for the 2025-27 cycle after their remarkable victory at Eden Gardens. The win, their first Test success in India since 2010, lifted them from fourth place to a PCT of 66.67, placing them just behind table-toppers Australia. Sri Lanka have slipped to third and India have fallen to fourth with a PCT of 54.17.Bavuma’s unbeaten 55 on a sharply turning surface and Harmer’s outstanding eight wickets across the match were central to South Africa taking a 1-0 lead. India, without regular captain Shubman Gill, stumbled while chasing 124 and folded for 93.Harmer backed up his 4-30 in the first innings with 4-21 in the second, while Keshav Maharaj struck twice and Marco Jansen removed both Indian openers to put the home side under serious pressure.Washington Sundar and Axar Patel tried to keep India afloat, with Sundar scoring 31 before falling to Aiden Markram and Patel’s brisk 26 ending against Maharaj. The victory sparked strong celebrations within the South African camp as they secured a rare and memorable Test win on Indian soil.",South Africa beat India by 30 runs to take 1-0 lead in Test series.

Inside Eden Debacle: How India missed many tricks during their shocking defeat

The debate over the Eden Gardens surface from the opening India vs South Africa Test has taken centre stage in cricket circles. India stumbled while chasing 124 on Day 3, which led many to question whether the pitch selection was a misjudgment. Despite the noise, head coach Gautam Gambhir maintained that the team got exactly the wicket they had requested and insisted it was not unplayable. South Africa’s spinners capitalised on the conditions to seal their first Test victory on Indian soil since 2010.Former cricketers have expressed contrasting views. Harbhajan Singh criticised the choice of surface, but Robin Uthappa came out strongly in defence of Gambhir, saying the coach should not be blamed for the collapse.Uthappa, speaking during a YouTube live, addressed comments that he was defending Gambhir. “Yaar, coach thodi jaake khel raha hai andar,” he said, pointing out that the coach is not the one out in the middle facing the bowlers.He added that criticism of coaches often ignores the bigger picture and cited how former head coach Rahul Dravid was also unfairly targeted. He said that someone who has scored 20,000 to 30,000 international runs deserves more respect and that the tendency to troll top figures shows how easily anyone can become a target.Uthappa then turned to the subject of pitch preparation. He highlighted a stark contrast between domestic and international cricket. He recalled that neutral curators were once appointed to oversee pitch conditions in domestic competitions and that groundsmen and associations were reprimanded if a game finished within two days. Yet at the international level, even matches ending in two-and-a-half days often pass without similar scrutiny.He noted that Ranji Trophy teams are discouraged from preparing turning tracks, even though progressively turning surfaces on Day 3 and Day 4 help develop batters who can cope with spin. According to Uthappa, India’s reluctance to prepare such pitches has contributed to players struggling in conditions that demand high-level spin play.","The debate over the Eden Gardens surface from the opening India vs South Africa Test has taken centre stage in cricket circles.

India cricketers spotted chilling Hobart ahead of T20I vs Australia

Poll Do you think Babar Azam's recent performance will affect his position in the team? Yes, definitely No, he will bounce back Maybe, depends on future games

NEW DELHI: Babar Azam ’s long-awaited return to three-figure form was supposed to mark the beginning of a resurgence. Instead, within days of breaking an 807-day and 83-innings century drought, the Pakistan superstar has been plunged into a new cycle of scrutiny — fined by the ICC for a conduct breach and dismissed for a duck in the T20I tri-series opener against Zimbabwe in Rawalpindi on Tuesday.The emotional swing was stark. The same week he celebrated a cathartic century against Sri Lanka, Babar walked out against Zimbabwe needing stability at No.3, only to be trapped LBW for a three-ball duck by Brad Evans. It continued a worrying pattern: this was Babar’s third duck in his last six T20Is, and it also pushed him past Shahid Afridi for the most ducks by a Pakistan batter in T20Is (nine).Adding to the turbulence, the ICC announced earlier that Babar had been fined 10% of his match fee for “abuse of cricket equipment” after striking the stumps with his bat upon dismissal in the third ODI vs Sri Lanka. It was his first offence in 24 months, drawing a demerit point.The irony is hard to miss. Babar’s triumphant century last week — his 20th in ODIs — was meant to silence critics after nearly two years of questions over form and leadership.Instead, the 31-year-old now finds himself navigating fresh headlines that once again question his trajectory.Former PCB chairman Ramiz Raja, who met Babar recently, revealed the batter’s private frustration with relentless scrutiny. “I met him in a cafe and he expressed his frustration at the way he had to face criticism, personal comments over his place in the team and his performances,” Ramiz said on his YouTube channel. His advice was clear: “Be patient and show restraint… your only job is to perform on the field.”Ramiz said he was “very happy” to see Babar back among the runs and insisted that strike-rate debates should not cloud his game. “He has all the shots… he just needs to bat longer.”For Pakistan, though, the concern is immediate: after a much-needed high, their premier batter is suddenly back under the microscope — again.",Babar Azam has been plunged into a new cycle of scrutiny.

Nitish Kumar Reddy is all set to rejoin India's Test squad ahead of the second match vs South Africa in Guwahati.

India have options of Devdutt Padikkal and Sai Sudharsan on the bench but adding another left-hander wouldn't be an ideal match-up.Reddy could be an ideal addition to the XI even if he bats lower down the order. It will allow them to keep the left-right going and keep match-ups in favour of the hosts.The first Test vs South Africa ended inside three days and now all eyes will be on the Guwahati fixture.

'We need to determine how he got it': Morne Morkel on Shubman Gill's injury & pitch quality at Eden Gardens

The Ashes, a historic cricket rivalry between Australia and England, has been a cornerstone of Test cricket for over a century. This prestigious contest emerged from a satirical newspaper obituary in 1882 and is represented by a small urn.The upcoming five-match series continues this longstanding tradition between the two cricket powerhouses.The Ashes originated in 1877 when cricket tests between English and Australian teams first began. The term ""Ashes"" emerged in August 1882 after a satirical obituary appeared in The Sporting Times following England's first home loss to Australia.The obituary suggested English cricket would be cremated with its ashes taken to Australia. English captain Ivo Bligh then led a team to Australia, promising to reclaim these symbolic ashes.A fan presented Bligh with a small terracotta urn after an England victory, establishing the physical symbol of the Ashes. Bligh met his future wife during this tour, and they moved to England with the urn, which remained in their family until it was given to the Marylebone Cricket Club after his death.The series now occurs approximately every two years, alternating between the two nations.The 1932-33 ""Bodyline"" series marked a significant moment in cricket history when England employed aggressive bowling tactics against Australian batters, particularly Don Bradman . This led to rule changes limiting such strategies.Shane Warne's first Ashes delivery in 1993 became known as the ""Ball of the Century,"" bewildering Mike Gatting with its exceptional spin at Old Trafford.Ben Stokes created history at Headingley in 2019 with an unbeaten 135, combining patience with aggressive batting to secure an unlikely one-wicket victory for England.The 2023 Ashes witnessed controversy when Jonny Bairstow was stumped at Lord's after leaving his crease, believing the ball was dead. This legal but disputed dismissal sparked heated debates about cricket's spirit, leading to Australian players facing verbal abuse in the Long Room.Australia have maintained possession of the Ashes since 2017, winning home series and drawing in England, including a 2-2 result in their last encounter.England have struggled in Australia, not winning a test match there since 2011, which was also their last series victory down under. They suffered heavy defeats of 5-0 in 2013-14 and 4-0 in both 2017-18 and 2021-22.Australia has dominated home Ashes series, losing only once (3-1 in 2010-11) since regaining the urn in 1989.Joe Root, currently ranked first among test batters, seeks his first Ashes century in Australia. His average of 35.68 in Australian conditions falls below his career average of 51.29.Ben Stokes leads England as captain and embodies their aggressive ""Bazball"" approach. Despite his six-hitting abilities, his Australian performances show modest averages of 28.61 with bat and 41 with ball.Jofra Archer returns for his first Australian Ashes series since his impressive 22-wicket performance in 2019. England hopes his fitness holds after recent injury setbacks.Steven Smith remains Australia's batting mainstay with 10,447 runs and 36 centuries at an average of 56.02. His Ashes record includes 12 centuries, with a highest score of 239 in Perth.Mitchell Starc leads Australia's pace attack with 402 wickets in 100 tests. The left-arm fast bowler, known for dismissing Rory Burns first ball in the previous home Ashes, ranks fourth among Australia's all-time wicket-takers.Scott Boland has impressed with 62 wickets at 16.53 in 14 tests, including a remarkable 6-7 on debut at the MCG in 2021. Despite these statistics, the 36-year-old often serves as backup to Australia's primary pace trio.The series begins in Perth on Friday, followed by a day-night test in Brisbane starting December 4.

Punam Raut exclusive interview: Ex-cricketer breaks down after Harmanpreet Kaur's historic win

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh women’s cricket captain Nigar Sultana Joty has broken her silence on allegations that she physically assaulted junior players in the national team — flatly denying the claims while taking a dramatic swipe at India’s World Cup-winning captain Harmanpreet Kaur The controversy erupted after former Bangladesh pacer Jahanara Alam , currently residing in Australia, alleged that several junior cricketers had contacted her, saying that Sultana had “hit” and “mistreated” them. The Bangladesh captain, however, dismissed the accusation as baseless and questioned why such complaints would be directed to someone who has been away from the team setup for years.In an interview with Daily Cricket, Sultana not only defended herself but also invoked Harmanpreet’s controversial behaviour during India’s 2023 tour of Bangladesh. The Indian captain had smashed the stumps after an LBW decision and later labelled the umpiring “pathetic” in the post-match presentation — an episode that created international headlines.“Why would I hit anyone? I mean, why would I strike the stumps with my bat? Am I Harmanpreet, that I would go around hitting the stumps like that? Why would I do it?” Sultana said, making her denial both pointed and provocative.“In my personal space, if I’m cooking or something, I might bang my bat around, I might hit my helmet—that’s my own business.But why would I do something like that to someone else? Why would I get physical? Just because someone says so? You can ask the other players or anyone else whether I’ve ever done anything like that.”Alam had earlier claimed that juniors reached out to her from Bangladesh, saying: “Please save us, Joty apu is beating us and finishing us off.” But Sultana questioned the logic behind such allegations.“The way I’ve been described in front of everyone—I’m not that kind of girl at all,” she said. “If I really beat someone or harmed someone in any way, is there no team management, no manager, no coaching staff? Am I the ultimate authority then? Why would a player call someone living in Australia? She could’ve shared it with anyone here.”Sultana recently led Bangladesh in the 2025 Women’s World Cup, where the side managed only one win, defeating Pakistan. The allegations have added an unexpected layer of turbulence to Bangladesh women’s cricket, but the captain remains firm: she insists she has never laid a hand on any teammate.","Bangladesh captain Nigar Sultana Joty vehemently denies allegations of physically assaulting junior players.

'When you don't play well, this is what happens': Gautam Gambhir reacts to 1st Test defeat, points out what India lacked

Former Indian cricket captain Sunil Gavaskar criticised the Indian batting performance after their 30-run defeat against South Africa in the first Test match at Eden Gardens, Kolkata.India failed to chase a target of 124 runs, giving South Africa a 1-0 lead in the two-Test Freedom Trophy series. The team played with 10 batters as captain Shubman Gill had to leave the field due to neck issues.Gavaskar pointed out that the lack of domestic cricket participation was the main reason behind India's batting collapse.""A lot of our players do not play domestic cricket. If you play domestic cricket, you will get to play on such pitches, right? Because even at the domestic level, teams are trying to get the points so that they qualify for the knockouts of the Ranji Trophy , which means that there will be pitches where the ball will grip and turn a little bit,"" the batting legend told Sports Tak.""But none of our players are playing that. None of our current players. How many of our current players actually deign to go down and play Ranji Trophy?""The legendary cricketer expressed concern about players avoiding domestic cricket, citing workload management. He suggested that team management should consider selecting players who actively participate in Ranji Trophy matches.""No, they don't because there's this word called workload.Workload is the word. They don't want to play. They don't want to play. They only want to play in the Ranji Trophy if they are out of form. Otherwise, they don't want to play. So that is the answer. Maybe you want to look at, you know, preparing a pitch where the ball will grip and turn a little bit. Then you want to pick guys who are playing domestic cricket. We do not really want to play guys who are playing international cricket because they don't have the practice against such kind,"" he added.The second Test of the series will be crucial for India as they look to level the series after their disappointing performance in Kolkata.The team's batting collapse in their pursuit of a modest target has raised concerns about their ability to handle challenging pitch conditions.Gavaskar's comments highlight the growing disconnect between domestic and international cricket in India, where established players often skip Ranji Trophy matches.The emphasis on workload management has become a contentious issue, with senior players frequently opting out of domestic cricket commitments.","India lost the first Test against South Africa by 30 runs in Kolkata. India failed to chase a target of 124 runs, giving South Africa a 1-0 lead. The team played with 10 batters as captain Shubman Gill had to leave the field due to neck issues.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125399611,imgsize-75166,width-400,resizemode-4/2025-ipl-eliminator-gujarat-titans-v-mumbai-indians.jpg"

A Father's Pride: How RR, Dravid & Vikram Shaped Vaibhav Suryavanshi

Poll Which aspect of Suryavanshi's game do you find most remarkable? Power-hitting Technique Mental strength Speed

SAMAY, ARYAN AND THEIR INDIA CONNECTION

NEW DELHI: '14 saal ke ho, kaise maarte ho ye chakke? [At 14, how are you smashing those sixes?]' — that’s the question curious Oman youngsters Samay Shrivastava and Aryan Bisht are eager to ask India’s new batting sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi, as the two sides gear up to face each other in the ACC Men’s Asia Cup Rising Stars clash in Doha on Tuesday.Suryavanshi arrives at the contest on the back of two explosive knocks. After smashing a jaw-dropping 144 off just 42 balls against UAE — a record-breaking assault that powered India A to a massive 148-run win — the 14-year-old left-hander followed it up with a blistering 28-ball 45 against Pakistan Shaheens.His knock against UAE was a stunning exhibition of clean, fearless power-hitting. He hammered 11 fours and 15 sixes, finishing with a staggering strike rate of 342.85 — the fourth-highest ever for a T20 century. His 32-ball hundred is now the joint-second fastest by an Indian in men’s T20s, equalling Rishabh Pant’s 2018 milestone and behind only the 28-ball tons by Urvil Patel and Abhishek Sharma in the 2024 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.Overall, Suryavanshi’s ton stands as the joint-fifth fastest century in T20 cricket history.“We’ve only seen Vaibhav Suryavanshi on TV, and now we’ll be playing against him. When you’re 14 and you’re able to hit the ball that far, that’s just exceptional talent. It’s something not everybody can do — definitely something I couldn’t do at that age. 14 saal ke ho, kaise maarte ho ye chakke? [At 14, how are you smashing those sixes?] He’s really talented and very good, so I’m really looking forward to playing against him,” Aryan told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.Samay, who represented Madhya Pradesh before moving to Oman in search of better career opportunities, is also in awe of the young big-hitting sensation.“It’s a great opportunity to meet him. I just want to know his mindset about cricket. He’s only 14 and he’s already doing so well for his cricket and for India. I definitely want to meet him — the way he hits those big sixes is extraordinary. I really want to meet him and talk to him,” Samay said.Both Samay and Aryan have strong India connections — and fascinating stories behind their journeys from India to Oman.So, what’s their story?Aryan, who traces his roots to Dehradun in Uttarakhand, was actually born and raised in Oman. His father moved there in the early 2000s for a job opportunity, and the family eventually settled in Oman.“I was born and brought up in Oman. I did a little bit of my schooling there, and the rest of it in India. I played Under-19 cricket for Oman and have come through the ranks. I’ve played a lot of local cricket as well in Oman after the Under-19s, and that’s how I made it into the national team. I am basically from Uttarakhand, Dehradun, and I have completed most of my studies there. My parents have been working in Oman for the last 25-30 years.“My dad moved to Oman in the 2000s after getting a job opportunity, and my mom joined him the following year. I was in seventh grade when they decided to move me to India to pursue cricket. They felt it would be better for me to learn the game in India initially, and that I could return to Oman anytime to represent the country. My cricketing foundation was built in India — I trained at an academy in Rudrapur,” he said.Samay, on the other hand, was born in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, and moved to Oman after playing domestic cricket in India. He steadily climbed through the ranks and has now become a vital cog in Oman’s bowling attack as a leg-spinner.A student of the craft, Samay draws his inspiration from the legendary Shane Warne “Shane Warne is my hero and idol. As a kid, I used to watch him and his videos, and I followed him in every way — his bowling, his mental strength, his skills… everything. I played with Venkatesh Iyer, Rajat Patidar and Ashutosh Sharma — age-group cricket and all-India tournaments. We are still in touch and keep talking to each other,” he added.Both Samay and Aryan were part of Oman’s squad during the 2025 Asia Cup — the tournament India won by defeating Pakistan in the final.(Watch Asia Cup Rising Stars 2025 on Sony Sports network)",Oman's Samay Shrivastava and Aryan Bisht will play against India's Vaibhav Suryavanshi in the Asia Cup Rising Stars clash in Doha on Tuesday.

Ryan Ten Doeschate press conference: On India Playing XI, Dhruv Jurel, workload management and more

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the second Test of the two-match series against South Africa in Guwahati, India batters Sai Sudharsan and Dhruv Jurel trained with only one pad during an optional session at Kolkata's Eden Gardens on Monday, using an old method meant to handle spin and improve footwork.Both faced spinners for nearly three hours while exposing one leg, a routine that carries some risk but is used to force batters to play with the bat rather than rely on pad defence.Sudharsan, a left-hander, took off his right pad to make a longer front-foot stride. He did not play the Eden Test, and his place in the Guwahati Test is uncertain. Batting against left-arm spinners and off-spinners without the front pad meant he had to avoid blows on the shin or any exposed area that could cause injury. Coaches have long used this drill to stop batters from falling into front-pad reflexes that often result in front-foot leg-before positions. Without the pad, the batter must use the bat as the first option.The method is meant to push them to step out and smother the turn.Meanwhile, Dhruv Jurel trained without his right pad while practising the reverse sweep on a centre strip. For a right-hander, the shot requires a large stride forward with the right leg, and removing the pad helps correct movement while limiting injury risk.Head coach Gautam Gambhir observed Sudharsan closely during the session. Sudharsan is in contention to replace Shubman Gill, who may miss the second Test because of a neck spasm.Only six players attended the optional session. Ravindra Jadeja, the senior-most member present, batted for the longest period.The second and final Test of the series will be played from November 22 at Barsapara Stadium in Guwahati. The visitors, the reigning World Test Championship winners, won the first Test in Kolkata by 30 runs inside three days after defending 123, their first Test win in India in 15 years. The result gave them a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.They will now attempt to secure a series win in the Guwahati Test.",Sai Sudharsan and Dhruv Jurel trained with only one pad during an optional session at Kolkata's Eden Gardens on Monday.

Inside Eden Debacle: How India missed many tricks during their shocking defeat

NEW DELHI: India ‘A’ cruised into the semifinals of the ACC Men’s Asia Cup Rising Stars 2025 with a convincing six-wicket victory over Oman at the West End Park International Cricket Stadium in Doha on Tuesday. With a knockout berth on the line, the contest served as a virtual quarterfinal, and India ‘A’ produced a composed all-round display to join Pakistan Shaheens in the final four.Set a target of 136, India ‘A’ made a shaky start as young opener Vaibhav Suryavanshi (12) and Priyansh Arya (10) were back in the hut early, leaving the side at 37 for 2 inside five overs. But Naman Dhir steadied the innings with a brisk 30 off just 19 deliveries, featuring two fours and two sixes, before falling against the run of play. Harsh Dubey then anchored the chase with maturity, keeping the scoreboard moving without taking unnecessary risks. The left-hander guided India ‘A’ home with an unbeaten 53 from 44 balls, decorated with seven boundaries and a six.Nehal Wadhera’s measured 23 off 24 balls proved crucial as the pair added a 66-run partnership for the fourth wicket, effectively shutting Oman out of the game. Skipper Jitesh Sharma applied the finishing touch with a boundary as India ’A’ wrapped up the chase at 138 for 4 in 17.5 overs.Earlier, Oman opted to bat but were restricted to 135 for 7, a total that always looked below par. Captain Hammad Mirza set the tone early with a blazing 32 off 16 balls, striking three fours and two sixes. However, once the Indian spinners found their rhythm, momentum shifted firmly.Leg-spinner Suyash Sharma was outstanding, picking up 2 for 12 in his four overs to dismiss Karan Sonavale (12) and Zikria Islam (0). Harsh Dubey (1/30) and Naman Dhir (1/5) kept a tight leash on the scoring through the middle phase, ensuring the pressure never eased.Wasim Ali battled hard for Oman, remaining unbeaten on a well-made 54 off 45 balls, but lacked support as wickets kept tumbling around him. Gurjapneet Singh’s two late strikes (2/37) further curtailed Oman’s hopes of a strong finish.With momentum on their side and a semifinal slot secured, India ‘A’ will look to carry this winning form into the business end of the tournament.India A will play the topper of Group A in the first semifinal on Friday while Pakistan play their last four clash also on the same day.",India ‘A’ cruised into the semifinals of the ACC Men’s Asia Cup Rising Stars 2025 with a convincing six-wicket victory over Oman on Tuesday.

On the squad and team environment





Growing up in Grenada





West Indies cricketer Andre Fletcher returned to MI Emirates as the most expensive buy at the ILT20 Auction and said the franchise feels like ""my family,"" in an interview.Fletcher, who has been with MI Emirates for three years, said he followed the auction with his wife and hoped the team would make one final bid to bring him back.""This is my family. I have been with them for the last three years since the beginning. It is always a pleasure playing for MIE and the guys,” Fletcher told MI Emirates.He said he knew from his agent that Dubai Capitals were also interested. “But honestly, I had no idea of the amount I got picked up for. When it reached a stage when it looked like the Capitals would get me, I just told my wife, ‘Please, please, I want to go to MIE’,” he said.“When the auctioneer said, ‘going once, going twice, sold to MIE’, I literally jumped and we started screaming,” Fletcher said.Fletcher said the price tag did not change his focus. “Money is not a big deal for me. I am very grateful for the money and the achievement, but I always bank on what I can bring to whatever team I get selected for,” he said in an interview to MI Emirates.. “As much as I am happy for being the highest paid player in the Auction, but I see more beyond the money.”Fletcher said MI Emirates had built a balanced squad for the season. “We have a very strong team, well balanced with experience and youth,” he said. He highlighted the roles of Nicholas Pooran and Kieron Pollard. “With the experience of a Pollard with the amount of titles he has won, and the talent of Pooran, we know gifted he is, I am happy to be on their side and not have to face them,” he said.He said the team had strength in both batting and bowling. “Our batters are very destructive and equally skillful as well,” Fletcher said, mentioning Kamindu Mendis’ ability against spin.Fletcher recalled his unbeaten 96 against Desert Vipers last season, a knock that helped MI Emirates boost its NRR and reach the playoffs. “It’s my highest score in the ILT20. It came after not playing a few games,” he said. “I was just happy to contribute and be in that partnership.”Fletcher spoke about his early life in Grenada and the cricketing culture there. “We are known for our spices,” he said. He listed places like waterfalls and beaches and said the country offers natural attractions. “Our people, we are very friendly,” he added.He said Grenada has produced cricketers such as Junior Murray, Devon Smith, Rawl Lewis and Nelon Pascal. He said infrastructure remains limited. “We don’t have an indoor facility. If there is rain around, we can’t really practice,” Fletcher said.Fletcher described his own childhood, when he played cricket using improvised balls. He said his elder brother pushed him to bat more aggressively. “That’s where I got my aggressive mindset from,” he said.He said sports runs in his family. “My mother was a cricketer as well. My sister, Sherry Fletcher ran in the Beijing Olympics,” he said. Fletcher recalled walking long distances with his cricket bag to reach the ground. “It was a lot of sacrifices,” he said.","West Indies cricketer Andre Fletcher returned to MI Emirates as the most expensive buy at the ILT20 Auction.

Chandigarh (II innings):

HUBBALI: R Smaran (227 n.o) and Shikhar Shetty (59, 2/43 & 5/61), two youngsters who say they have benefited immensely from the return of seasoned pros Karun Nair (95) and Shreyas Gopal (62, 7/73 & 3/45), turned showstoppers in the Ranji Trophy match against Chandigarh here as Karnataka recorded an innings and 185-run victory with a day to spare on Tuesday.After Smaran’s remarkably composed 227 not out on Monday, Shreyas wreaked havoc with the ball, leaving Chandigarh with a mountain to climb. They never did, as 16 Chandigarh wickets fell on Tuesday.While Karnataka’s bowlers barely put a foot wrong, Chandigarh’s players appeared confused about the format. They swung the willow like tailenders in a T20 game, attempting to hoick just about everything over the fence.Sample this: Of the 222 runs Chandigarh scored in the first innings, 124 came off boundaries. But that was also their undoing. Barring skipper Manan Vohra, who scored an unbeaten 161-ball 106 (12x4; 1x6), most of the others did not bother to either fight time or the opposition. They were easy pickings for the home side.Chandigarh began the day at 72/4, a humongous 475 runs in deficit. Shreyas, who scalped three of those four wickets on Monday, capped a fine all-round performance by adding another four Chandigarh first innings wickets to his kitty.The carnage began right from the first ball. Ankit Kaushik was struck on the back foot, a situation the opposition batters often found themselves in when trying to defend, and was adjudged leg-before off Shreyas.Rajangad Bawa (10) and Gaurav Puri (32) offered some resistance before the former edged Shreyas to wicketkeeper KL Shrijith. Gaurav struck three consecutive boundaries off Shreyas’ bowling before a Shikhar delivery turned sharply and disturbed his middle stump.Chandigarh went into lunch with 199/8 on board, and it didn’t take Shikhar and Shreyas long to mop up the tail.Trailing by 325 runs, the visiting side was asked to follow on, but they seemed to be in a hurry to head back home. They lasted all of 33.5 overs.Pacer Vidwath Kaverappa opened the floodgates when Ajun Azad (0) handed Mohsin Khan a catch at midoff in the third over. Shivam Bhambri (43) and Nikhil Thakur delayed the inevitable with their 64-run partnership for the second wicket. But with Shreyas and Shikhar applying pressure, they crumbled.Shivam’s attempt to play defence against Shikhar was taken by Smaran in the slips, and that added momentum to Karnataka’s victory march.On the slow track, Shikhar upped his pace and mixed it with slower deliveries to leave the Chandigarh batters confused as they ensured the left-arm pacers maiden five-wicket haul in his third First Class match. They lost their last four wickets for the addition of 15 runs.The 20-year-old Shikhar, who also scored his first half-century, later said, “I’m yet to process the fact that I’ve taken a five-wicket haul in Ranji Trophy. I’m pleased to have delivered for the team. It has been a learning curve to play alongside Shreyas, who constantly guides me on the field. I try my best to match that.”With the win, Karnataka will head into the break for white ball competition as Group B toppers with 21 points.

ROOT UNDER NO PRESSURE

BENGALURU: India, once invincible at home in the longer format, have been beaten in their backyard in the recent past. Their 30-run loss to South Africa at Eden Gardens on Sunday is their fourth defeat in six home Test matches. It is a significant statistic for a nation that suffered only four defeats in home Tests between Feb 2013 to Oct 2024Questions are being raised about India’s dominance at home. Addressing these concerns, former Australian player and coach Justin Langer put the debate to rest.""Anyone who suggests it's the end of (home domination) in this country, they're a more courageous person than me because I would never say that, there's too much talent in India,"" Langer told TOI.However, the batters have been poor in the last four defeats, mostly in spin-friendly conditions. They were bundled out for less than 200 on five instances. Their ability to dig deep and stay at the crease in difficult conditions has come under the scanner. In the first Test against South Africa, India batted for 97.2 overs across two innings, while in the New Zealand series, which they lost 0-3 last year, they occupied the crease for 324 overs across eight innings.The visiting spinners have found success in troubling Indian batters on tough batting surfaces. To a large extent, with overseas players plying their trade in the Indian Premier League, Indian conditions are no longer alien to them.""The greatest highlight of my career was beating India in that 2004 series because it always felt impossible to beat India in India. That was the Mount Everest moment of our career. So it's really interesting, isn't it, that we're seeing a bit of a change with visiting teams beating India in India? Perhaps it is because some of the other countries and their players are playing in the IPL too,"" Langer, the brand ambassador of NiviCap, said here on Monday.With the next Test starting on Nov 22 in Guwahati, Langer expects India to fight back.""Remember, some of the Indian players just came from Australia (white-ball series, which ended on Nov 8), where it's opposite. And a few days later, they're playing in really tough conditions in Kolkata. India have got some very good players in that team and they'll be disappointed and look to fight back in the next Test.""With the Ashes, featuring Australia and England in Perth starting on Friday, Joe Root has become a talking point. The Englishman, who has 39 Test tons, is searching for his elusive three-digit mark in Australia.But Langer believes Root is under no pressure. ""Root has got more Test runs than anyone in the history of English cricket. He is a superstar. Yes, at the moment he hasn't scored a Test hundred (in Australia). Will he score it in the next five Tests? Only time will tell. But, he's under zero pressure (to score the elusive ton).""",India's 30-run loss to South Africa at Eden Gardens on Sunday is their fourth defeat in six home Test matches.

Why the Gabba is not hosting the first Test



The “Gabbatoir”



The Ashes is one of cricket’s oldest contests, created after a mock newspaper obituary in 1882 and represented by a small urn. The rivalry between Australia and England has influenced Test cricket for more than 100 years.England will face Australia in the first Test on Friday with what observers say is their most hostile bowling group in many years. For the first time since 1982, the opening match of an Ashes series in Australia will not be held at Brisbane’s Gabba.Since 1986, the Gabba has hosted the first Test between the two sides, with Australia winning seven and drawing two of the 10 matches played there in that period.The last Ashes series in Australia that did not begin at the Gabba was in 1982, when the teams played a draw at the WACA in Perth.Although the Ashes feels proud of its long history, commercial decisions and new scheduling priorities have led to the Gabba losing hosting rights for the series opener.Perth Stadium has a 10-year agreement to host the first Test of the Australian summer, The Telegraph reported. The city has created a West Test festival around it and has enough hotel capacity for visiting supporters.Australia last lost an Ashes opener at the Gabba in 1986 to Mike Gatting’s England.They have not lost another Ashes Test at the ground since then.This year, the Gabba will host the second Test of the series from December 4-8. It will be the venue’s first day-night Ashes match. After that, the five-match series will move to Adelaide Oval from December 17-21 for its first daytime Ashes Test since 2013, when Mitchell Johnson took 7-40 in the first innings to set up a 218-run win for Australia. The Melbourne Cricket Ground will host the Boxing Day Test, and the Sydney Cricket Ground will stage the New Year’s Test from January 4-8.Former England player Chris Woakes called the absence of a Gabba opener a “one-percenter”, saying England teams need any help they can get on Ashes tours. Starting away from the Gabba might be one such small help.Teams often find it easier when they do not begin at the “Gabbatoir”, a name linked to the ground’s intense atmosphere. Located near Vulture Street in Brisbane’s industrial zone, the Gabba has a long record of difficult experiences for England teams.Several incidents there remain part of Ashes history. In 1954-55, Len Hutton’s decision to bowl first backfired before England recovered later in the series. In 2006-07, Steve Harmison’s first ball to second slip set the tone for a 5-0 whitewash. In 2013-14, Mitchell Johnson delivered a fierce performance that set the tone for the series. In the following Ashes, the Jonny Bairstow headbutt story broke during the Test. In the last series, Rory Burns was bowled by Mitchell Starc on the first ball at The Gabba.England will still play at the Gabba this time, but in the second Test under lights. The new order of Perth followed by Brisbane may create a different kind of challenge. But for now, England begin the series at Perth Stadium.It remains to be seen whether this change is a “one-percenter” in England’s favour or if results continue as before.Australia have won 13 and drawn two of the 15 Ashes Tests at home since England’s win in Sydney in 2011. Australia won the last home Ashes 4-0 in 2021-22 and retained the urn last year with a 2-2 draw in England.","First Ashes Test since 1982 will not be held at Brisbane's Gabba. Perth Stadium has a 10-year agreement to host the first Test of the Australian summer. The Gabba will host the second Ashes Test from December 4-8. After that, the five- match series will move to Adelaide Oval from December 17-21.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125412427,imgsize-41678,width-400,resizemode-4/lk-39.jpg"

Inside Eden Debacle: How India missed many tricks during their shocking defeat

NEW DELHI: Former England spinner Monty Panesar backed his countrymen to reclaim the Ashes Down Under for the first time in 15 years, saying that Ben Stokes and Co. will win the series if they clinch the first Test in Perth.Panesar, who took part in England’s away Ashes campaigns in 2006–07 and 2013–14, believes the current squad is better equipped to perform much better than those earlier touring sides that were whitewashed 5–0 in Australia.Although Australia haven’t lost a home Test to England since 2011, Panesar believes the visitors have an edge this time given the hosts’ mounting injury concerns.""You look at Australia and there’s no Pat Cummins and no Josh Hazlewood. They’ve got an opener, which is a David Warner replacement, but we don't know how he's going to go about it.“Usman Khawaja in the last couple of years, his record has not been great, let's be honest. So, I just think England are on edge here, if England win the first Test match (they can win the series),"" Panesar said on SENWA Breakfast.While Australia boast Nathan Lyon, who has 562 Test wickets, Panesar believes 22-year-old English spinner Shoaib Bashir has the potential to outperform the veteran on his own turf, despite Bashir having only 68 Test wickets at an average of 39.“I think they (England) will win at Brisbane, Adelaide will probably be Australia, Melbourne, I think maybe Australia again. If it’s two-all going into Sydney, it will be the battle of the spinners. And who knows, it could be just Shoaib Bashir coming into his own there, so I believe it'll be 3-2 or 3-1, England,"" he added.The first Test between Australia and England begins in Perth on Friday.",Former England spinner Monty Panesar backs his countrymen to reclaim the Ashes Down Under for the first time in 15 years.

NEW DELHI: Australia’s blockbuster five-Test Ashes series against England gets underway on Friday in Perth, but the hosts will be missing a key figure right from the start. Captain Pat Cummins , the leader of Australia’s pace attack, has been ruled out of the opening Test.Following the Perth Test, the action moves quickly across the country: Brisbane hosts the day-night second Test from December 4, Adelaide stages the third match from December 17–21, the traditional Boxing Day Test begins at the MCG on December 26, and the series finale starts at the SCG on January 4.Cummins is ruled out of the opening Test due to a persistent lower-back injury that has hampered his preparation for the series. Cummins’ back injury has kept him out of competitive cricket in the lead-up to the Ashes, and medical staff have advised he will not be ready for the intensity of the opening Test. His absence leaves Australia without their frontline fast bowler and captain for the series opener in Perth. The good news for the home side is that he is expected to regain full fitness in time for the second Test at the Gabba starting December 4.With Cummins unavailable, former skipper Steven Smith will step in to lead Australia against England in the first Test beginning November 21.Australia enter the series in a dominant position, having held the Ashes since 2017 through a combination of home victories and hard-fought drawn series in England. Their last tour to England ended 2-2, a fiery contest that has only added to the anticipation surrounding this year’s showdown.England, meanwhile, are looking to overturn a decade-long drought in Australia. They have not won an Ashes Test on Australian soil since the 2010-11 series — also their last Ashes series win Down Under. Since then, their tours have been tough: a 5-0 whitewash in 2013-14 was followed by 4-0 defeats in both 2017-18 and 2021-22. Australia’s 3-1 defeat in 2010-11 remains their only home Ashes loss since reclaiming the urn in 1989.The top-ranked Test batter and second-highest scorer in the format, Root surprisingly has never made an Ashes century in Australia. His average of 35.68 in 14 Tests here is well below his overall mark of 51.29.England’s talismanic captain and the face of the “Bazball” revolution. Despite his match-winning ability, Stokes averages just 28.61 with the bat and 41 with the ball in Australia.Set for his first Ashes tour of Australia. Known for his intimidating pace and his famous 2019 spells against Smith and Labuschagne. England will be desperate for him to stay fit.Australia’s batting cornerstone for more than a decade. With 10,447 runs, 36 centuries and an average of 56.02, Smith sits just behind Bradman in Australia’s Test hierarchy. His 12 Ashes hundreds include a best of 239 in Perth.The only fit member of the first-choice pace trio. The left-arm quick, with 402 wickets in 100 Tests, remains a major threat with the new ball and is fourth on Australia’s all-time wicket list.A fan favourite since his extraordinary 6-7 on debut at the MCG in 2021. Despite an outstanding average of 16.53 in 14 Tests, Boland has often missed out due to the strength of Australia’s pace depth — but Cummins’ absence may open the door.","Pat Cummins is ruled out of the opening Test due to a persistent lower-back injury.

Kieran Tierney and Kenny McLean scored spectacular injury-time goals to give Scotland a dramatic 4-2 victory over Denmark on Tuesday, sealing their qualification for the 2026 World Cup. Spain also confirmed their spot after a 2-2 draw with Turkey. Belgium joined them with a 7-0 demolition of Liechtenstein, while Switzerland and Austria both secured their places after picking up draws. All five nations will feature at the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico next year.Scotland’s late surge in Glasgow ensured Steve Clarke’s team reached the World Cup for the first time since 1998. With the match tied at 2-2 beyond the 90th minute, Denmark were on course to progress as Group C winners until Tierney curled in a superb long-range strike three minutes into stoppage time. McLean settled the contest deep into added time, lofting the ball over Kasper Schmeichel from the halfway line in the 98th minute after spotting the Danish goalkeeper far off his line.“That just sums up this squad,” captain Andy Robertson told the BBC. “Never say die. We just keep going right to the end and one of the craziest games. We put the country through it, but I’m sure it’s worth it. We’re going to the World Cup.”Scotland made the perfect start when Scott McTominay scored with an overhead kick in the third minute.Rasmus Hojlund equalised for Denmark from the penalty spot just before the hour, but the visitors were reduced to 10 men soon after when Rasmus Kristensen received a second yellow card. Hampden Park erupted again in the 78th minute as Lawrence Shankland tapped in from close range, only for Patrick Dorgu to level four minutes later. Tierney and McLean then delivered the decisive blows. Denmark now head to Thursday’s draw for the European play-offs, scheduled for March.Switzerland booked their sixth straight World Cup appearance after a 1-1 draw in Pristina against Kosovo. Needing only to avoid a heavy defeat, they stayed in control for most of the match. Ruben Vargas put them ahead early in the second half, before Florent Muslija equalised.Spain, the Euro 2024 champions, also needed to avoid a seven-goal loss in Seville against Turkey and never looked in danger. Dani Olmo opened the scoring, though Deniz Gul and Salih Ozcan found the net for Turkey to hand Spain their first goals conceded in qualifying. Mikel Oyarzabal equalised after the hour to preserve Spain’s unbeaten run. “We wanted to finish with a win and a clean sheet, so it’s bitter-sweet... but we’re happy to qualify for the World Cup,” Olmo told TVE.Austria snatched a place at their first World Cup in 28 years after a 1-1 draw with Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to Michael Gregoritsch’s 77th-minute equaliser. Haris Tabakovic’s early strike had threatened to upset Ralf Rangnick’s side before the leveller sent Bosnia into the play-offs. “I can’t believe it; we made it! I have been trying to reach the World Cup for 18 years. Finally now, at the end of my career, we got there. I can’t wait,” said 36-year-old Marko Arnautovic, via UEFA.com.Belgium, semi-finalists in 2018, eased into the World Cup draw with a dominant win in Liege. Jeremy Doku scored twice, Charles De Ketelaere added a brace of his own and Hans Vanaken, Brandon Mechele and Alexis Saelemaekers also found the net. Wales matched that scoreline in Group J, beating North Macedonia 7-1, with Harry Wilson recording a hat-trick from set pieces. North Macedonia will still feature in the play-offs thanks to their Nations League ranking. Romania, who defeated San Marino 7-0, will also head to the play-offs after finishing third in Group H, and Sweden secured their own spot with a 1-1 draw against Slovenia.The European play-offs will feature 16 teams and offer four additional berths for next year’s World Cup in North America.","Kieran Tierney and Kenny McLean scored spectacular injury-time goals to give Scotland a dramatic 4-2 victory over Denmark on Tuesday.

A Women's Super League referee Lisa Benn told a London employment tribunal that she lost her international position after reporting that a referee coach pushed her during a game in March 2023. She claimed the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) gave her lower recommendations after she complained about coach Steve Child's conduct, BBC reported.The incident occurred at a PGMOL tournament focused on video assistant referee (VAR) training. After a delay due to an injury, Benn says Child grabbed her arm and pushed her onto the pitch to start a game.During the match, Child told a fourth official to instruct Benn to ""kill the game."" Benn responded by saying ""don't tell me how to referee"" and used an expletive towards Child.""I am a trusted referee, I referee at the highest level - this was an under-19s game,"" Benn told the panel.""He felt superior, he felt like he could come on and tell me how to referee, he manhandled me on to the field of play - he would never have done that to a male referee,"" she stated.When questioned if she had witnessed Child behaving similarly with other referees, Benn responded: ""I have to female referees, yes.I haven't to male referees.""Benn claims Child approached her after the game, grabbed her arm and said ""your card has been marked.""""He was so angry his eyes were bulging out of his head,"" she told the tribunal, as cited by BBC.PGMOL's representative Jesse Crozier suggested Child may have simply guided her to the pitch, but Benn rejected this explanation.Crozier stated: ""If you had been dragged, grabbed and pushed at a training tournament with dozens and dozens of people, someone would have seen it."" Benn disagreed with this assessment.A PGMOL investigation determined Child's actions did not warrant disciplinary measures. Benn claims that while PGMOL's chief refereeing officer Howard Webb and his wife Bibiana Steinhaus-Webb, then head of women's referees, assured her she would not face consequences for reporting the incident, the organization subsequently reduced their support for her.Benn states this reduced support resulted in her losing a position on FIFA's international referee list.The tribunal proceedings are ongoing.",Lisa Benn told a London employment tribunal that she lost her international position after reporting that a referee coach pushed her during a game in March 2023.

Poll Who do you think is in the right in the PSG vs Kylian Mbappe feud? Kylian Mbappe Paris Saint-Germain Both sides equally Neither side is right

The long-simmering feud between Paris Saint-Germain and Kylian Mbappe erupted into a full-blown legal and financial battle on Monday as both sides arrived at an industrial court with staggering monetary demands — together exceeding €700 million.The French superstar, who joined Real Madrid on a free transfer in the summer of 2024, claims PSG owes him more than €260 million. This includes unpaid wages, bonuses, severance, and damages, all stemming from his argument that his fixed-term contract should be reclassified as a permanent one — a technical shift that would entitle him to compensation for unfair dismissal.Mbappe had earlier demanded €55 million in unpaid wages. His new claim now encompasses much more, including allegations of moral harassment, undeclared work, and breaches of PSG's duty of good faith and workplace safety.“Kylian Mbappe is not asking for anything beyond what the law provides; he is simply seeking the enforcement of his legal rights, as any employee would,” his advisers said in a statement. The forward did not attend the hearing in person.PSG responded with an even larger counter-claim: €440 million. The club argues that Mbappe's refusal to extend his contract — while also rejecting a €300 million offer from Saudi side Al-Hilal in 2023 — cost them a massive “loss of opportunity” to secure a record transfer fee. The Ligue 1 champions also seek compensation for alleged breaches of good faith, reputational harm, and image damage.The club said it presented evidence that Mbappe acted “disloyally” by hiding his decision not to extend his contract for nearly a year — from July 2022 to June 2023 — leaving PSG powerless to negotiate a transfer.PSG further accused the striker of reneging on an August 2023 agreement involving a salary reduction should he leave on a free transfer. Mbappe's camp insists such an agreement never existed, and says PSG failed to provide proof.The forward has also accused the club of “lofting” — a French term describing the isolation of a player from the main squad. Mbappe was excluded from the preseason tour to Japan and South Korea and initially left out of Ligue 1's opening match after informing the club he would not trigger his extension clause.PSG has denied any harassment or mistreatment, insisting Mbappe featured in “more than 94%” of official matches that season under a coach who went on to win the Champions League.The court's ruling is expected next month, with both sides bracing for one of football's most financially explosive verdicts.","Kylian Mbappe claims PSG owes him more than €260 million.

Germany and the Netherlands sealed their World Cup berths in emphatic fashion on Monday, producing goal-laden performances in their final European qualifying matches to underline their status as major contenders for next year’s global showpiece in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Julian Nagelsmann’s Germany destroyed Slovakia 6-0 in Leipzig, while Ronald Koeman’s Netherlands swept past Lithuania 4-0 in Amsterdam. Both teams needed only a draw to secure qualification but showed zero appetite for caution.“Every player played well today and worked like a dog,” Nagelsmann told German broadcaster ZDF after his side overwhelmed Group A rivals. Four-time world champions Germany, level on points with Slovakia before kick-off, seized command early. Nick Woltemade headed the opener in the 18th minute, and once Serge Gnabry doubled the lead, the hosts never looked back. Leroy Sane struck twice before half-time, with Ridle Baku and Assan Ouedraogo completing the rout after the break.“We’re relieved. It’s a great moment,” a jubilant Woltemade told ZDF. “I’m playing, I’m scoring goals and I’m hopefully playing at the World Cup.”Elsewhere in Group A, Northern Ireland beat Luxembourg 1-0 but remained third.However, their Nations League ranking guarantees them a place in March’s 16-team European play-offs.In Amsterdam, the Netherlands delivered a high-tempo masterclass that thrilled more than 50,000 fans. Lithuania were pinned deep from the start, with Tijani Reijnders finishing off a neat move initiated by Frenkie de Jong to open the scoring. A superb first-half display by goalkeeper Edvinas Gertmonas delayed the inevitable, but Cody Gakpo’s 58th-minute penalty unlocked the floodgates. Xavi Simons and Donyell Malen struck in quick succession as Koeman’s men cruised.Reijnders, who did not debut until after the 2022 Qatar World Cup, savoured the moment. “I watched it at home, on the couch, with my Oranje shirt on,” he said. “This time it’s going to be very different for me… I’m really looking forward to taking part for the first time.”In other matches, Croatia—already assured of Group L’s top spot—fought back to beat Montenegro 3-2, while the Czech Republic thrashed Gibraltar 6-0.

Norway qualified for their first World Cup since 1998 after a 4-1 win over Italy on Sunday, with Erling Haaland scoring twice to confirm their place in next summer’s tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Haaland scored both of his goals within seconds at San Siro, as Norway finished Group I with 24 points from eight matches.Before the match, Norway would have needed to lose by nine goals or more for Italy to overtake them for the group’s only automatic World Cup spot. Instead, Stale Solbakken’s team ended their campaign with a win in front of 70,000 spectators.Solbakken did not make any predictions about Norway’s chances at the World Cup.""Let's see the draw first... I haven't even thought about it. For me, it (tonight) was to go from 99 percent to 100 percent and now we have done it in a great way,"" Solbakken told reporters, as quoted by news agency AFP.""Let's see what the draw brings before we go into those questions.""Haaland’s father Alf-Inge was still an international player when Norway last played in a World Cup 27 years ago, a tournament won by France.Solbakken described Haaland as a ""goal machine"".

He scored goals in the 78th and 79th minutes.Italy had taken the lead through Pio Esposito in the 11th minute.

"'Diego Maradona and I were like Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, but we partied together’: Lothar Matthaus",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/diego-maradona-and-i-were-like-lionel-messi-cristiano-ronaldo-but-we-partied-together-lothar-matthaus/articleshow/125377200.cms,"Lothar Matthaus (PTI Photo/Manvender Vashist Lav)

Kolkata : If Diego Maradona didn’t exist, could the football world be able get a Lothar Matthaus? Or vice versa? Sometimes, some friendships are born of a rivalry, unexpectedly but eventually as a necessity to thrive on each other’s exploits before becoming part of football folklore.Matthaus — assigned to man-mark Maradona in the 1986 World Cup final in Mexico — ended up seeing his Argentine rival lift the game’s biggest crown on the way to establishing his legend. Four years later in Italy, the German defender — now captaining his side — turned the table spectacularly, earning his spurs and denying the Argentine his second successive shot at glory.“Diego was the best footballer in my time. We were like Messi and Ronaldo. (But) they are not talking to each other. They don’t make parties together after the game. But Diego and me — we had many private moments and we made parties after the game too,” Matthaus — here in the city as official ambassador of the upcoming Bengal Super League — said on Sunday.“During the game, we had fights. We didn’t know each other like friends. I think we profited from each other. And in the end, Diego made me bigger and I made him bigger,” reminisced Matthaus, who won the Ballon d’Or after winning the 1990 World Cup.It was perhaps his adoration for Maradona the entertainer that might have prompted the German to become a fan of Lionel Messi in contemporary football. “I don’t like to say that Messi is better than (Cristiano) Ronaldo. It’s very difficult because they are different kinds of players. Ronaldo is more about the power and physicality. Messi is more like the smartest guy, (he’s) more about the entertainment. I am a fan of Messi because of his style of football,” he explained his point of view.Germany’s recent struggle to live up to expectations was also a concern for him. “This is not what we expect from the national team,” he quipped in disappointment, in reference to their elimination from the group stage itself in 2018 and 2022. So, what is missing in Die Mannschaft? “Passion,” pat came the reply.","Lothar Matthaus was assigned to man-mark Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup final in Mexico.

Who is Damone Clark? Cowboys waive linebacker as Perrion Winfrey returns from injured reverse ahead of Eagles',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/who-is-damone-clark-cowboys-waive-linebacker-as-perrion-winfrey-returns-from-injured-reverse-ahead-of-eagles/articleshow/125424308.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Why did the Dallas Cowboys waive Damone Clark?

Damone Clark is a 25-year-old linebacker and measures 6-foot-3 while weighs 240 pounds. He played college football at Louisiana State University (LSU), where he took part in 39 games over four seasons from 2018 to 2021. He was chosen by the Dallas Cowboys in the fifth round (No. 176 overall) of the 2022 NFL Draft, but faced a big challenge early in his professional journey when he had to undergo cervical fusion surgery on his neck during the offseason.Despite everything, he made an impressive comeback and debuted in Week 9 of his rookie season, starting three games and making 34 tackles. In his first complete season in 2023, Clark played all 17 games, achieving a career-high of 79 tackles. By 2025, after 39 games with the Cowboys, he had tallied 198 tackles, two forced fumbles, one fumble recovery, and 0.5 sacks. This season, leading up to his waiver, Clark participated in eight games, primarily on special teams, with a total of 14 tackles (seven solo). He was not active for the Cowboys' win over the Raiders on November 17, 2025.The Cowboys decided to let Clark go due to a packed linebacker lineup and the need to fine-tune the roster for the upcoming games.Recently, Dallas traded for linebacker Logan Wilson, got DeMarvion Overshown back from injury, and has seen some good plays from rookie Shemar James and second-year player Marist Liufau.Clark started 26 games in his four seasons, but his role has shrunk this year, especially after the defensive scheme changes with the new coordinators. His early career looked promising, especially after recovering from neck surgery, but he ended up getting fewer snaps in the post-Dan Quinn period. Now that he's a free agent on NFL waivers, Clark's release creates chances for other teams looking to add linebacker depth.Head coach Brian Schottenheimer addressed Clark's departure, he explained in a statement to the media, saying, ""I want to really emphasize how much Damone means to me. What an incredible young man he is. In my conversation with him, I said, 'Hey man, your career is just getting started, and sometimes change is good.' I really do believe that, that's not bullsh*t. That's what I truly believe. I think you have to handle things the right way, and this gives him a chance to find a home and get excited. "" Schottenheimer also praised the linebacker group moving forward, calling it a ""young, capable room"" that he ""really loves.""To fill the roster position left by Clark, the Cowboys activated defensive tackle Perrion Winfrey from injured reserve on November 18, 2025. Winfrey initially joined Dallas in the 2025 offseason after receiving All-UFL honors with the Birmingham Stallions in 2024.He was part of the initial 53-man roster but ended up on IR in September due to a back injury from the preseason. After opening his 21-day practice window in late October and demonstrating solid progress in rehab, he was cleared to return—this marks the sixth IR activation for Dallas this season, approaching the NFL limit of eight.Schottenheimer addressed the corresponding move during the same Frisco news conference, telling reporters, “We have to be very selective of what we’ve done,” before adding, “it’s going to all depend on how these next couple weeks go and hopefully we stay healthy. But if somebody breaks a chin strap and they’re going to miss a little bit of time, you have to obviously make decisions to bolster your roster. In that regard, there’s quite a few really good football players in that area. ”Clark’s waiver reflects the brutal reality of the NFL where even promising careers can be reshaped by roster needs and scheme changes. Dallas is clearly prioritizing flexibility and youth at linebacker while reinforcing the defensive line with Perrion Winfrey.Also Read: “We all want to meet her”: Steelers WAGs grow frustrated as Aaron Rodgers’ secretive wife remains a complete mystery","Damone Clark is a 25-year-old linebacker and measures 6-foot-3 while weighs 240 pounds.

Ja’Marr Chase’s bizarre excuse for spitting on Jalen Ramsey fuels heated league-wide debate as suspension appeal looms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jamarr-chases-bizarre-excuse-for-spitting-on-jalen-ramsey-fuels-heated-league-wide-debate-as-suspension-appeal-looms/articleshow/125424045.cms,"Bengals star Ja'Marr Chase faces a one-game suspension for spitting on Jalen Ramsey, a move he plans to appeal by claiming the spit was unintentional. This controversial explanation comes as Cincinnati desperately needs wins, and the NFL's precedent with Jalen Carter's ejection for spitting could hurt Chase's case. The outcome significantly impacts the struggling Bengals' playoff hopes.

Ja’Marr Chase’s suspension appeal takes an unexpected angle as the Bengals enter a must-win stretch

Ja’Marr Chase has found himself at the center of one of the NFL ’s most talked-about controversies of the week, and the fallout is only getting more complicated. The Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver, who is in the middle of another standout season, was suspended one game for spitting on Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback Jalen Ramsey during their heated Week 11 matchup.Though Ramsey was ejected for throwing a punch, videos soon confirmed Chase’s role in escalating the fight. Now, as the Bengals face a critical moment in a troubled season, Chase is preparing to appeal the suspension with an explanation that has raised eyebrows across the league and online.According to Ian Rapoport, Chase is expected to argue that the spit wasn’t targeted, that he was simply spitting and Ramsey “happened to be standing there.” It is an explanation that many fans have already deemed flimsy, especially after slow-motion clips clearly show Chase turning in Ramsey’s direction. As Mike Florio noted, Chase may also attempt to claim there is no established precedent for suspending a player for spitting.But the NFL has a counterpoint: earlier this season, Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was ejected for spitting on Dak Prescott.While Carter wasn’t technically suspended, the league treated his ejection as a full game served, and he forfeited his Week 1 game check. That history could now work against Chase.The incident couldn’t come at a worse time for Cincinnati. The Bengals sit at 3-7 and are clinging to faint playoff hopes as they prepare for a must-win game against the New England Patriots in Week 12. Losing Chase, a player with 79 catches, 861 yards, and 5 touchdowns through 10 games, would be a devastating blow for a team already struggling with consistency.While the appeal may give Chase a chance to clarify his intent, the league’s stance on unsportsmanlike conduct has only tightened in recent seasons. Whether his argument persuades an appeals officer or not, the situation underscores how quickly emotions can shift a game and a season. For the Bengals, the outcome of this appeal could influence far more than a single Sunday.Also Read: “We all want to meet her”: Steelers WAGs grow frustrated as Aaron Rodgers’ secretive wife remains a complete mystery",Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase was suspended one game for spitting on Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback Jalen Ramsey.

Joe Alwyn’s GQ moment sparks debate over whether he’s redefining himself beyond Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/joe-alwyns-gq-moment-sparks-debate-over-whether-hes-redefining-himself-beyond-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce/articleshow/125423906.cms,"Joe Alwyn is back in the spotlight with a GQ Germany cover. He is recognized as Actor of the Year. This marks a new phase in his career, focusing on his acting. Experts are discussing if this is a strategic move. Alwyn's recent work and industry buzz suggest a significant career breakthrough.

PR experts split on whether Joe Alwyn’s GQ triumph is a career milestone or a strategic reset

Joe Alwyn has stepped back into the spotlight, this time with intention, confidence, and a global magazine cover that has everyone talking. As the British actor fronts GQ Germany’s 2025 Men of the Year issue, his striking photoshoot and Actor of the Year recognition signal a new chapter, one rooted in his craft rather than his former relationship with Taylor Swift.The timing of the cover, arriving months after Swift’s fiancé Travis Kelce graced GQ in the U.S., has fueled conversation about whether Alwyn is making a purposeful move to reclaim his narrative. With PR experts divided, Alwyn’s latest career milestone invites a deeper look at how he is shaping his public identity on his own terms.Alwyn’s GQ spread showcases him shirtless alongside a horse, embodying the magazine’s theme of depth and authenticity. GQ praised him as someone who “imbues [roles] with depth, serenity and authenticity,” underscoring his evolution as an actor. But beyond the visuals, the discussion centers on what this moment represents in the broader cultural landscape shaped by Swift and her high-profile romance with Travis Kelce.Emily Reynolds Bergh of R Public Relations called the timing “strategic,” suggesting that Alwyn may be distancing himself from the “Taylor’s ex” narrative.She explained, “When the biggest pop figure on earth and the NFL’s most visible tight end confirm their engagement [their] narrative becomes the cultural tide everyone else must either fight or surf.” Bergh also noted that Kelce’s own GQ cover, where he was dubbed “America’s Sweetheart,” reflected his effort to transcend sports headlines, something she believes Alwyn may also be aiming for.However, celebrity publicist Lucy Donaghey argued that Alwyn’s appearance is rooted in merit, not media competition. She pointed to his acclaimed performances in The Brutalist, The Woman of the Sea, and the upcoming Hamnet, saying the timing “reflects his own achievements.” Donaghey emphasized, “GQ has even tipped him as a contender for the next James Bond,” highlighting his growing industry clout.Alwyn, who previously said he focuses on “controlling what I can control,” appears poised for a breakthrough era, one shaped not by past relationships but by a career hitting new heights.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s ‘The Fate of Ophelia’ has fans convinced she’s revisiting her Joe Alwyn breakup — making clear it’s not about Travis Kelce","Joe Alwyn is recognized as Actor of the Year in GQ Germany.

Paired with a white turtleneck, white pants, pointed heels, and mirrored sunglasses, her look echoed the team’s traditional colors while elevating the game-day aesthetic into full runway mode. Though her bold outfit didn’t bring Kansas City good luck, it did fuel conversation across social media, something Hunt knows how to generate effortlessly.Not long after the game, she shifted focus to a major announcement, revealing on Instagram that she would be appearing on an upcoming episode of The Will Cain Show.“I’m so excited! See you tomorrow at the @Will Cain Show,” she shared, a sign of her growing role in sports media and her expanding personal brand.Meanwhile, the Chiefs continue grappling with their mid-season slump. Despite strong numbers from Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce , including 276 passing yards from Mahomes and 91 receiving yards from Kelce, a late Denver field goal sealed another frustrating loss. In response, head coach Andy Reid urged fans to stay calm, saying, “So we’re not quite as negative as the outside world is… this isn’t like this one’s lost.”With the Colts looming next, Kansas City must rediscover its championship rhythm.

Initially bothered by women pursuing her husband, she developed a resilient mindset, prioritizing her peace and focusing on her entrepreneurial ventures and family. Her evolution demonstrates strength and self-preservation alongside a celebrated athlete.

How Brittany Mahomes turned early frustrations into confidence as Patrick’s career took off

Long before Patrick Mahomes became a two-time MVP and the face of an NFL dynasty, he was just a Texas high school athlete dating a driven, outspoken teen named Brittany Matthews. Their love story wasn’t born under stadium spotlights, but once the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback rocketed to stardom, Brittany found herself thrust into a level of public attention few partners are prepared for.From relentless social media commentary to fan obsession over the league’s most marketable star, the pressure grew fast and so did the judgment aimed squarely at her. Years later, as an entrepreneur, mother of three, and a familiar face in Chiefs Kingdom, Brittany has openly acknowledged how overwhelming some of those early experiences truly were.Back in 2023, during an Instagram Q&A, Brittany addressed one of the biggest challenges she had faced: dealing with women openly pursuing her husband. When a follower asked, “How do you deal with all the women trying to get after your husband?” her honesty surprised many. “I did use to have a very hard time and get extremely annoyed,” she admitted. “But I am now to a point where I could care less!”Her shift in mindset reflected years of personal growth. By that time, Brittany was already balancing motherhood with expanding business ventures and preparing to welcome her third child in 2025. She added, “It's actually really sad how disrespectful some women are... But they are a waste of my time and not going to disturb my peace.”While some NFL partners choose near-complete privacy, Brittany embraced visibility, supporting Patrick publicly, showing up on the sidelines, and carving out her own identity beyond being a quarterback’s wife. It’s a balance that even celebrity partners like Hailee Steinfeld and Brittani Rodgers rarely attempt.Patrick himself has long expressed admiration for her strength. “I admire my wife Brittany's confidence,” he told People. “Whether it's in business, or supporting our family, she always leads with strength and purpose.”As the Chiefs work through a challenging season, that steadiness remains as important as ever. And after more than a decade together, Brittany’s evolution shows just how much resilience it takes to stand beside one of the NFL’s biggest stars, without losing yourself in the noise.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes addresses nonstop flirting aimed at Patrick Mahomes with surprising calm","Brittany Mahomes is the wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.

Old reports on what pushed Gisele Bündchen to end her marriage to Tom Brady resurface

Tom Brady’s Ex-Wife Cheating And Having A Baby By Jiu-Jitsu Coach | CLUB SHAY SHAY

When Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen ended their 13-year marriage back in 2022, the world focused heavily on football schedules, retirement timelines, and the pressures of fame. But months later, one conversation from Shannon Sharpe’s Club Shay Shay podcast added a different layer, one that continues to resurface whenever the former couple lands back in headlines.Sharpe suggested that, despite Brady’s $300 million fortune, emotional fulfillment mattered far more in the relationship than material comfort. His theory reignited discussions about what may have quietly eroded the marriage long before the public ever suspected trouble. Now, revisiting those comments offers a clearer glimpse into why their split still fascinates fans years later.On his podcast, Sharpe didn’t hold back when analyzing why the relationship may have reached its breaking point. “I think the problem with Tom is he's probably thinking, 'I've got all this money, why does she need to do that?' No, she's got all this money, and yet he still couldn't please his ex,” he said, arguing that personal connection, not wealth, might have been the real issue.His co-host quickly added, “Oh, yeah, because they don't want money,” prompting Sharpe to double down on the emotional angle. “Maybe she wanted time. Maybe she wanted attention.I don't know what she wanted.”His remarks arrived at a time when Brady and Bündchen were rebuilding their lives separately, he stepped deeper into media and team ownership, while she focused on her relationship with Joaquim Valente. The former supermodel later welcomed a baby boy with Valente, marking a new chapter far removed from her years in the NFL spotlight.Even years after their divorce, Sharpe’s comments continue to resonate because they capture a universal truth about relationships under pressure: money can’t fill emotional voids. The couple’s split reminds fans that even the most glamorous marriages can be undone by everyday needs like presence, connection, and shared priorities.Brady and Bündchen have long moved forward, but the lessons drawn from their breakup and Sharpe’s blunt assessment, still linger as a reminder that love requires more than financial security.Also Read: Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bündchen melts hearts as she prioritizes children’s empowerment before marking milestone celebration","Old reports on what pushed Gisele Bündchen to end her marriage to Tom Brady resurface.

Insiders suggest the separation was for branding protection, not personal conflict. With Lively's legal issues easing, a reunion is reportedly on the horizon, though Swift's wedding guest list remains uncertain. Their bond, though paused, shows signs of thawing.

Blake Lively and Taylor Swift’s quiet rift may finally be thawing as insiders hint at a long-awaited reunion

Blake Lively and Taylor Swift were once one of pop culture’s most reassuring constants, two powerhouse women who managed to maintain a genuine friendship despite fame, motherhood, and constant public scrutiny. But the past year has been unusually turbulent. As the Blake Lively–Justin Baldoni legal feud escalated, Swift slowly stepped away, creating the first real distance the duo had ever shown.Their silence sparked endless speculation, from rumored feuds to strategic distancing. Now, with Lively reportedly “glowing, relieved, and walking lighter” after a judge dismissed Jed Wallace’s defamation lawsuit, new whispers suggest the door to a reunion may be cracking open.Insiders close to both stars say the separation was never personal, it was branding. According to #ShuterScoop, both women “were drowning in headlines they didn’t ask for,” and stepping back was a protective move rather than a betrayal. But with Lively finally gaining small victories after months of legal tension, the emotional strain appears to be easing. One source claims Lively “misses her. The families, the laughter, the old comfort.Still, the distance hasn’t been without consequences. Page Six previously reported the pair had “no contact” since last winter, fueled partly by Swift feeling “used” after being pulled into Baldoni’s lawsuit through Lively’s private messages that referred to Swift as one of her “dragons.” It was the kind of public entanglement Swift has long tried to avoid.Complicating the picture further is Swift’s upcoming wedding to Travis Kelce. While she joked on The Graham Norton Show that she might invite “anyone I’ve ever talked to,” other reports claim Lively and Ryan Reynolds won’t make the guest list. The reason? Swift wants the celebration free of “awkward energy.”Yet tiny signs of warming remain, Lively liking Swift’s posts, Swift slipping in lyrical nods to loyalty. Their orbit hasn’t snapped; it’s simply paused.Whether they reunite publicly or quietly rebuild behind the scenes, their friendship isn’t a simple celebrity fallout, it’s a study in the pressures of fame, loyalty, and self-protection. And for fans, the hope is still very much alive.Also Read: Taylor Swift allegedly rethinks her entire wedding approach with Travis Kelce as insiders say she wants a bigger, more spectacular celebration","Blake Lively and Taylor Swift were once one of pop culture's most reassuring constants.

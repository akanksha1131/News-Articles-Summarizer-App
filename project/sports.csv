"How Yashasvi Jaiswal prepared for Perth century: 200 overs on inclined concrete slabs, synthetic balls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/how-yashasvi-jaiswal-prepared-for-perth-century-200-overs-on-inclined-concrete-slabs-synthetic-balls/articleshow/115616069.cms,"Yashasvi Jaiswal (AP Photo)

NEW DELHI: The seeds of success are sown in thorough preparation and Yashasvi Jaiswal 's intense and innovative pre-tour training against short-pitched balls at the Thane Stadium contributed to his unbeaten 90 on the second day of the opening Test against Australia.Rahul Dravid's hours of training at the National Cricket Academy ahead of the 2011 tour of England or Sachin Tendulkar creating rough outside the leg-stump and asking Laxman Sivaramakrishnan to simulate Shane Warne's leg-breaks have found place in Indian cricketing folklore.Jaiswal, the next batting superstar in waiting, too is meticulous about his training methods, most of which he has developed under Rajasthan Royals' Director of Cricket Zubin Bharucha at their academy in Maharashtra's Talegaon, where he has trained since lockdown.However, due to a short gap between the New Zealand series and the flight to Australia, Jaiswal had to make a quick mental and technical switch-over from the rank turners at home to counter the steep bounce which he would encounter Down Under, especially at the opening game in Perth.For a couple of days from morning till late evening, Jaiswal was stationed at the Thane stadium near his home, roughly facing 200 overs of throw-downs with a concrete slab positioned on an inclined plane (45 degree angle) at short of length (around the 10 metre area).There Jaiswal was fed with throw-downs using orange and yellow coloured balls which were aimed at his rib cage and outside the off-stump around 145 clicks.""The time was less so he practised at the Thane Stadium. The balls that were used were lighter in nature and hence travelled quicker through the air. The concrete slab was kept at short of length and he faced roughly around 200 overs across two days before he left for Australia,"" Bharucha, who is currently in Jeddah for the IPL auctions, shared with PTI.So, how does one manage to play 100 overs in a day?""The rotational speed per ball is rapid, i.e. it's just ball after ball without any break. So, we can get through this easily in 2.5 hours with just a couple of breaks,"" the former Mumbai opener offered an insight.In earlier days before a tour to Australia or South Africa, the standard mode was to get throw-downs on cement wickets from 15 yards with wet tennis balls. But just like cricket has changed over the years, the method of coaching has also changed.""Bounce is something that cannot always be simulated on turf pitches like rough that Sachin Tendulkar created for simulation. Hence concrete slab kept at an inclined plane creates that skiddy uncomfortable bounce. Also the synthetic balls that are used are a bit softer.""It looks like hockey balls but is way lighter and hence travels quicker. Obviously, you can't create seam movement simulation but nevertheless it is a very good mode of practice,"" a former first-class cricketer, who has also worked as a coach at the NCA, explained.This is a mode of training that even India's assistant coach Abhishek Nayar uses for his wards like KKR's Angkrish Raghuvanshi.""For swing, Mumbai batters of particular vintage used a rubber ball heavy with mud on one side which then starts deviating in air. For seam movement, you can put threads on turf wickets and hit those threads to get some amount of movement off the surface but that's not a very popular method till now,"" he said.",Yashasvi Jaiswal scored 90 on the second day of the opening Test against Australia. Rajasthan Royals' Director of Cricket Zubin Bharucha explains Jaiswalk's pre-tour training methods. JaIswal faced 200 overs of throw-downs with a concrete slab positioned on an inclined plane (45 degree angle) at short of length.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115616061,imgsize-42410,width-400,resizemode-4/115616061.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Opening duo Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul ground down a flagging Australian attack, forced to be on the field on back-to-back days, to take India to 172/0 in their second innings as the tourists reached a position of dominance to lead by 218 runs on Day 2 of the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at Perth's Optus Stadium.Jaiswal and Rahul also became the first Indian opening pair to score 100 runs in Australia in Tests in the last 20 years.Talking on 7Cricket, India's assistant coach Abhishek Nayar explained what prompted India's turnaround after being bowled out for 150 in the first innings.Nayar says, ""I think in the first innings there was a lot more assistance for the fast bowlers and I also felt with Yashasvi playing his first game in Australia, getting a bit of feedback, had a few conversations after the first innings, try to evaluate and work around our gameplan and I felt in the second innings we left a lot more balls and we were a lot more prepared to play a longer innings.""On being asked how captain and pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah motivated the Indian players in the dressing room after 150 all out, Nayar said, ""Well I think when the team is always in trouble it's the leadership group that always comes in, Gauti bhai (Gautam Gambhir), Bumrah, I think the talk was all about the belief. When we played at the WACA , we had a great preparation camp and we realized that if you can hit the right areas in Australia, specially in Perth, you can get assistance and we knew with the kind of attack we had, if we got early wickets, things could happen, captain stepped up, picked up those 3 wickets, got the momentum going, sometimes you just need the rub of the green and I thought we had it our way.""On captain Rohit Sharma joining the squad in Perth, Nayar said, ""We're very hopeful that he'll be here soon, he'll start his preparations and hope to see him soon.""After a duck in the first innings, Jaiswal reached his fourth Test in the second innings with a six.Jaiswal and Rahul also registered the first Indian 200+ opening stand in Australia, before Rahul fell for 77.India dominated Day 2 of the Test thanks to Jaiswal and Rahul, taking advantage of a significant change in the nature of the pitch from Day 1.With the sun blazing down on it, the surface has flattened out significantly from a spicy green seamer where it was darting around everywhere.In the last session of the day, a few deliveries remained low, though, suggesting that the bounce is already variable.Thwarting Australia, Rahul and Jaiswal batted two whole sessions increasing India's lead to 218 at Stumps on Day 2.","India's assistant coach Abhishek Nayar explains what prompted India's turnaround after being bowled out for 150 in the first innings.

Both openers remained not out at the close of Day 02.In his exclusive commentary for Star Sports, Gavaskar highlighted how KL Rahul's presence helped reduce pressure on his batting partner Yashasvi Jaiswal.""I think what he's done is he's eased up the pressure on Yashasvi Jaiswal. When you have a partner at the other end who's looking so secure, like Rahul is doing, then the other partner who's got more strokes, who's a little more adventurous in playing shots, and that's what happened. So Yashasvi Jaiswal has actually flowered in his company. You can say that because he's seen the solidity of Rahul,"" Gavaskar was quoted in a release from Star Sports as saying.Gavaskar noted the quality of India's batting display on Saturday in Perth.""Rahul hasn't missed out on his scoring opportunities. When the ball's been pitched up, he's driven it gloriously through the covers. There is this straight drive that he played off Pat Cummins as well. Brilliant. It's been a very, very good innings. It's been what you would call a proper five-day Test match innings,"" he added.India demonstrated resilience after being dismissed for 150 in their first innings at Perth.

Labuschagne came charging in, picked up the ball and faked a throw at the stumps.Not to be undone, Jaiswal also stopped just short of his crease to tease Labuschagne, who pretended to throw the ball thrice but all the time the Indian opener just stood inches outside his crease and pretended to reach the crease twice with his foot and once with his bat.In the end, neither Labuschagne threw the ball nor Jaiswal had to rush back to his crease but both ended sporting smiles.To his credit, Jaiswal, who hit 2 sixes in his knock on Day 2, breaking the record of former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum for most sixes in a calendar year in Tests.

So more gratitude, more humble, more hungry, that's what I'll say.""On his different approach to wicket-keeping in Perth, Pant says, ""I think I have to stand a long way back but it's much better than wicket-keeping on the rank turners (in India).

It was difficult to wait for my debut, says Harshit Rana

NEW DELHI: After a chaotic first day that saw 17 wickets fall, only three wickets tumbled on the second day of the first Test between India and Australia, as the pitch has changed drastically at the Optus Stadium in Perth.What initially seemed like a match destined to finish within three days now appears likely to extend further, given the current situation.Indian openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul batted resolutely through two sessions, frustrating Australia with their unbeaten 172-run partnership. Their effort has put the visitors firmly in control, extending India's lead to 218 runs.The formidable Australian pace trio of Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood struggled to make an impact, despite their dominance in the first innings.Now the big question emerges regarding the drastic transformation of the Perth pitch . The surface, which was a nightmare for batters on Friday, turned into a batting paradise just a day later?In the lead-up to the Test, the Perth pitch lacked ideal preparation due to unseasonal rain, with the general belief being that the absence of ample sunshine had left it with plenty of spice.However, the second day saw the sun shining brightly, transforming conditions. The heavy cricketing action on the first day hardened the surface, leaving little assistance for the bowlers. And the moment the ball became old and the seam became softer, the run making was a very easy affair on Day 2.Pitch curator Isaac McDonald acknowledged before the match that unseasonal rain had prevented the ground staff from preparing the pitch in their usual manner.""Yeah, it's definitely not traditional Perth Test prep,"" the curator said on Wednesday.Australia head coach Andrew McDonald also came out in support of his bowlers saying they have done no wrong but the pitch dried up quite quickly that eventually helped Indian batters.""The surface looked considerably dry today. It dried out fairly quickly,"" said McDonald during the post-day press conference.""We thought there may have been a little bit more there. So, I suppose if you want to say that we were a little bit surprised, yeah, there wasn't as much seam movement or swing.Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan took a hilarious dig at the way the Perth pitch changed in just two days.""Itna jaldi to meri wife ka mood bhi change nahi hota jitni jaldi ye pitch badli hai,"" Pathan wrote on X while commenting about the change in pitch colour.","India lead Australia by 218 runs after second day of first Test in Perth.

Watch: Rohit Sharma leaves for Australia post the arrival of his second child

Indian captain Rohit Sharma left for Australia on Saturday to join his team for the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test series.Rohit's delayed departure is due to the birth of his second child. He remained in Mumbai, continuing his training while informing the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) about his absence for the first Test.Rohit prioritised spending time with his family and newborn before joining the team.He plans to begin his preparations in Perth and then shifts his focus to the second Test which is a day-night affair scheduled to be held in Adelaide.The 37-year-old would be participating in the warm-up game in Canberra starting on 30 November.In Rohit's absence, Jasprit Bumrah assumed the role of captaincy for the Perth Test .On the match front, openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul ’s unbeaten half-centuries in the second innings propelled India to a commanding 172 for no loss at stumps on day two of the opening Test.India had earlier dismissed Australia for 104 in 51.2 overs, securing a 46-run first-innings lead.Jaiswal (90 not out off 193 balls) and Rahul (62 not out off 153 balls) capitalised on the strong position, extending India’s lead to a substantial 218 runs.Pacer Jasprit Bumrah’s five-wicket haul, his 11th in Test matches, was instrumental in dismissing Australia shortly after they reached the 100-run mark in their innings.Bumrah finished with impressive figures of 5/30, leading the Indian bowling attack. Mohammed Siraj provided valuable support with 2/20, while debutant Harshit Rana chipped in with 3/48.Australia’s batting performance was underwhelming, managing to add only 37 runs to their overnight score of 67 for 7.Tail-ender Mitchell Starc ’s 26 runs emerged as the highest score for the Australian side.","Rohit's delayed departure is due to the birth of his second child.

KOLKATA: Shahbaz Ahmed hit a blazing unbeaten century to help Bengal make a winning start by beating defending champions Punjab by four wickets in Group ‘A’ of Syed Mushtaq Ali (T20) meet in Rajkot on Saturday.Chasing a formidable 180 runs for victory, Bengal were looking down the barrel after being reduced to 10 for four inside the first four overs. But Shahbaz and skipper Sudip Gharami then orchestrated a turnaround by stitching together a 110-run fifth-wicket stand in just 60 deliveries to put Bengal on victory path.Although Mayank Markande struck by having Gharami stumped by Prabhsimran Singh for a well-made 43 (31b, 3x4, 2x6), Writtick Chatterjee provided good support to Shahbaz.However, it was still a tall task as Bengal needed 49 runs in the last five overs. But there’s no stopping Shahbaz who managed to clear the boundary ropes at regular frequency.Punjab’s star pacer Arshdeep Singh , who drew first blood by dismissing Abhishek Porel in the third ball of their innings, picked up Chatterjee on the last ball of the 18th over on his return for the second spell.But that could not deter Shahbaz who hit him for a six and then finished off things with a four and reached the three-figure mark. The all-rounder hit seven sixes and six fours during his 49-ball stay in the middle.Punjab skipper Abhishek Sharma provided the side a brisk start hitting Mohammed Shami for two sixes in the first over after Gharami won the toss and elected to field.The left-hander hit pacer Kanishk Seth for another six in the next over but was caught by Gharami in the same over. A 57-run second-wicket stand between Prabhsimran and Anmolpreet Singh then strengthened Punjab’s position but Bengal bowlers managed to restrict the run flow in the middle overs by picking up regular wickets.Karan Lal came good with the ball picking three for 23 and Writtick claimed two for 26 as Punjab were bowled out for 179 in 19.4 overs.However, Shami went for runs ending with one for 46 in his four overs.",Bengal beat Punjab by four wickets in Group ‘A’ of Syed Mushtaq Ali (T20) meet in Rajkot on Saturday.

HOT PICKS FOR FINISHER'S ROLE:

NEW DELHI: The excitement of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) auction was felt during the ongoing first Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) in Perth. Walking past Rishabh Pant during the opening day of the match, Australian off-spinner Nathan Lyon poked the Indian wicketkeeper-batsman. ""Where are we in the auction?"" Lyon asked. Pant replied: ""No idea.""While the venue in Jeddah, the Abadi Al Johar Arena, gets the final coat of IPL colours, the playful incident in Perth showed that the auction is part of the game's backdrop and is on players' minds. In fact, the two-day auction falls bang in the middle of the match, on November 24-25, and the Australians know that Pant will be in demand after not being retained by his franchise, Delhi Capitals.Pant, in fact, is one of the hottest properties in the auction pool. A captain, finisher and wicketkeeper rolled into one, he is one player who can tick multiple boxes for his team.Talking about the three skills that Pant brings to the table, many franchises will be looking for one player who has the stature and commands respect to lead an IPL team.""Rishabh has that attitude to win a Cup anywhere,"" Raina, who used to play for Chennai Super Kings , told Timesofindia.com ahead of the auction. ""He tried in Delhi, worked very hard there...Same goes with Shreyas Iyer (not retained by KKR), same goes with KL Rahul (not retained by Lucknow Super Giants) because right now it's not just about buying players.""They (teams) are also looking for a captain. Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ), Punjab Kings, Delhi, Lucknow -- four teams are such that they are looking for an Indian captain,"" Raina analysed.Rishabh Pant, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Jos Buttler, Aiden MarkramThe role of wicketkeeper extends far beyond his duty behind the stumps, which is especially true in T20 cricket where teams look for 'keepers who can play either as a top-order batter or can play the role of a finisher in the middle and lower order.Interestingly, three players who will potentially lead the teams that buy them, also qualify for the wicketkeeper's role and are expected to trigger a bidding war between franchises.Leading the list of wicketkeepers in demand is Pant once again.Rishabh Pant, KL Rahul, Jos Buttler, Ishan Kishan Quinton de Kock , Jitesh Sharma, Phil Salt, Rahmanullah GurbazThe finisher's role is always an important slot for any T20 team around the world. The big-hitting prowess of South African Heinrich Klaasen, who has been retained by his franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad, is the latest example of how a finisher can change the destiny of his team.The uncapped Ashutosh Sharma took the IPL 2024 by storm while playing for the Punjab Kings. His 189 runs came at a strike rate of 167.25, including 10 fours and 15 sixes.Besides him, proven international performers like David Miller and Glenn Maxwell could fetch another lucrative deal despite being in the twilight of their careerDavid Miller, Ashutosh Sharma, Liam Livingstone, Tim David, Marcus Stoinis, Glenn Maxwell","Rishabh Pant will be in demand after not being retained by his franchise, Delhi Capitals.

NEW DELHI: Mohammed Shami , the seasoned Indian pacer, had a modest return to white-ball cricket following the 2023 World Cup final.Representing Bengal in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy match against Punjab, Shami conceded 46 runs in his four-over spell, claiming one wicket.Shami had recently marked his comeback to red-ball cricket during a Ranji Trophy match against Madhya Pradesh, where his seven-wicket haul had impressed.Punjab, batting first, posted a total of 179 runs before being dismissed in the final over of their innings.Contributions from Prabhsimran Singh (35), Anmolpreet Singh (39), and a late cameo from Arshdeep Singh (23 not out) bolstered Punjab's total.Karan Lal was the pick of the Bengal bowlers, securing three wickets.Bengal, in pursuit of the target, were guided by Shahbaz Ahmed's resolute century (100).Despite a tight spell from Arshdeep Singh, who took two wickets for 21 runs, Bengal successfully chased down the total with an over to spare, securing a four-wicket victory.All-rounder Hardik Pandya smashed a blistering 74 off 35 balls (6 fours, 5 sixes) to lead Baroda to a five-wicket victory over Gujarat.Earlier, Hardik contributed with the ball as well, picking up a wicket while conceding 37 runs in his four overs as Gujarat posted 184/5.Axar Patel remained unbeaten with a steady 43 off 33 balls but went wicketless in his four overs, conceding 31 runs. Leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi impressed with two crucial wickets.India's left-hander Rinku Singh played a valiant knock of 70 off 38 balls (8 fours, 4 sixes), but Uttar Pradesh fell short in their chase of Delhi's massive 233/3, finishing at 186/8.Nitish Rana's 61 off 42 balls also went in vain, despite former India pacer Ishant Sharma impressing with figures of 2/23 in his four overs.For Delhi, Priyansh Arya stole the show with a blistering 102 off 43 balls (5 fours, 10 sixes), while Himmat Singh contributed an unbeaten 77 off 34 balls (4 fours, 6 sixes).Skipper Sanju Samson 's 75 (45 balls, 10x4, 3x6) was enough for Kerala to ward off an exceptional four for seven in three overs by Pulkit Narang to chase down Services' 149 for nine in 18.1 overs.","Mohammed Shami made a modest return to white-ball cricket following the 2023 World Cup final.

NEW DELHI: Swashbuckling Rishabh Pant is set for a date with history as he and other big domestic and international superstars will go under the hammer at the two-day Indian Premier League (IPL) mega auction starting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Sunday.The 10 franchises will be bidding for a total 577 players to fill 204 possible slots and build a team around their core set of players as world's top cricketers are expected to laugh their way to the banks.The 10 teams will have a cumulative Rs 641.5 crores in the kitty with Punjab Kings -- Rs 110.50 crore in their coffers -- ready to outbid the others.As top cricketers gear up for a massive payday, here's a look at the top 10 players to watch out for at the auction.After failed negotiations with Delhi Capitals, Rishabh Pant is expected to become one of the most expensive players at the IPL auction history, potentially exceeding the Rs 20-crore mark.At 27, Rishabh Pant was sidelined from competitive cricket for over a year following a severe car accident in December 2022. However, he made a comeback to captain the Delhi Capitals in 2024.India's premier wicketkeeper-batsman and the franchise then parted ways after a disappointing sixth-place finish, and Pant is now set to enter the auction with a base price of Rs 2 crore.Multiple franchises, including Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Punjab Kings, Lucknow Super Giants, and Kolkata Knight Riders, are seeking a captain, and Pant could step into that role.DC however have the option to buy him back with a right-to-match (RTM) card.After Lucknow Super Giants failed to reach the play-offs last season, the franchise and KL Rahul parted ways.Along with his leadership, Rahul's performance with the bat too was under-par as his strike rate was a key topic of discussion.Rahul scored 520 runs in 14 matches last season at a strike rate of 136.But despite the criticism, Rahul's experience as both a batter and a captain makes him an appealing prospect for other franchises.RCB, in search of a new captain, could look to bring the Karnataka batter back to his home ground, while Delhi Capitals and Gujarat Titans might also show interest.Title winning skipper Shreyas Iyer's release by Kolkata Knight Riders came as a major shock, especially just a few months after he led the franchise to their third title.Iyer now is expected to attract significant attention in the auction, with several teams looking for a new captain.Delhi Capitals could go all out to bring Iyer back, while RCB may also be interested in adding him to their squad.After missing IPL 2023 due to injury, Iyer made a strong comeback in IPL 2024 , scoring 351 runs in 14 matches at a strike rate of 146.Iyer is one of the star players whose price is likely to exceed Rs 20 crore at the auction.After the retention deadline came to an end, Punjab Kings’ decision to release Arshdeep Singh came as a surprise to many.Arshdeep, who played a crucial role in India’s T20 World Cup victory earlier this year, has been one of the most consistent bowlers in both T20Is and the IPL over the last three years.But Punjab retained just two uncapped players -- Shashank Singh and Prabhsimran Singh -- and with the largest purse of Rs 110.5 crore, they are looking to completely rebuild their squad under new coach Ricky Ponting.Arshdeep, who impressed during the South Africa T20I series with eight wickets from four matches, is renowned for his ability to swing the new ball and bowl yorkers at the death.Punjab may attempt to use the RTM (Right to Match) card to bring him back, but with several teams showing interest in the young pacer, the competition could drive his price beyond Rs 20 crore.Ishan Kishan had a disappointing IPL 2024, scoring just one fifty in 14 matches and totaling 320 runs at a strike rate of 148.He then lost his India central contract after choosing not to play in the Ranji Trophy, which led to him falling out of favor across all formats.Mumbai Indians decided to retain Tilak Varma over Kishan, among their five retained players.With Rs 45 crore remaining in their purse, MI may struggle to bring Kishan back at the auction.Kishan will be on target for several franchises, including RCB, Gujarat Titans, Lucknow Super Giants and Delhi Capitals.Bought for Rs 15.25 crore at the IPL 2022 mega auction, Kishan is likely to attract another significant bid this time.Ishan has played 105 matches for Mumbai Indians, scoring 2,644 runs at a strike rate of 135, including 16 half-centuries.Yuzvendra Chahal, the star performer for Rajasthan Royals, was released despite his top service to the franchise.Having joined the Royals during the IPL 2022 mega auction, Chahal was a key figure with the ball, taking 66 wickets in 46 matches.At 34, the leg-spinner is the IPL's all-time leading wicket-taker, with 205 wickets in 160 matches at an impressive economy rate of 7.84.Franchises like Mumbai Indians, Punjab Kings, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Gujarat Titans will be on a lookout for an experienced leggie, which could lead to intense bidding war at the auction.Despite his inconsistency, Glenn Maxwell remains a favorite at every IPL auction.Known for his ability to dismantle bowling attacks with unconventional shots like reverse sweeps and switch hits, Maxwell stands out as a powerful T20 batter.He is also a useful bowler, adding value in multiple areas.Maxwell had a tough IPL 2024, scoring only 52 runs in 10 matches for RCB, with a best of 28. However, he was effective with the ball, taking six wickets at an economy rate of eight.With a solid T20 record of 10,052 runs in 449 matches at a strike rate of 153, Maxwell remains a sought-after player.RCB could use their RTM option to bring him back, as he shares a strong bond with Virat Kohli. However, Punjab Kings, under new head coach Ricky Ponting, and Delhi Capitals, with their revamped coaching staff, could also be ready to make a strong bid for the spin all-rounder.Australian speedster Mitchell Starc, 34, made headlines last year when he set a new IPL auction record, with Kolkata Knight Riders securing his services for Rs 24.75 crore.The left-arm quick and powerful lower-order hitter played a crucial role in their title run, including a standout performance in the final against Sunrisers Hyderabad, where he took 2-14.However, despite his impact, KKR chose not to retain him ahead of the IPL 2025 auction.With 193 wickets from 142 T20 matches, the towering Starc – standing at 1.96 meters (6 feet 4 inches) – will yet again be on the radar of the franchises during the bidding war.Known as ""Killer Miller"" for his explosive batting, the South African has a T20I strike rate close to 140.The 35-year-old is now on the lookout for a new team after playing with Gujarat Titans since the franchise's inception in 2022, having scored 210 runs in nine matches during last season.India's dismissal of Miller in this year's T20 World Cup final in Barbados was a key moment in the match and the Proteas went on to lose.Miller is expected to spark a bidding war at the auction, having registered with a base price of Rs 1.5 crore.New Zealand's Rachin Ravindra made an instant impact in his IPL debut this year, smashing 222 runs at a punishing strike rate above 161 for Chennai Super Kings.The left-hander's ability to play spin with aplomb on subcontinent pitches saw him fare well during last year's ODI World Cup and in New Zealand's recent 3-0 Test whitewash in India.The Wellington-born Ravindra's parents hail from Bengaluru and hopes abound there that he will join the city's franchise, which also features fan favourite Virat Kohli.Ravindra enters the auction at Rs 1.5 crore base price.","IPL mega auction starts in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Sunday. 10 franchises will be bidding for a total 577 players to fill 204 possible slots.

NEW DELHI: Legendary Sunil Gavaskar was on Saturday full of praise for Yashasvi Jaiswal after his brilliant batting display against Australia, stating that the young opener has the 'cricketing world at his feet'.Gavaskar, who was renowned for his own opening skills, noted that Jaiswal brings a refreshing approach to the role, playing with aggression rather than being overly cautious.On Day 2, Jaiswal finished unbeaten on 90, forming a solid 172-run partnership with KL Rahul (62 not out).Together, they frustrated the Australian pace trio of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, and Josh Hazlewood, as well as veteran spinner Nathan Lyon, giving India a commanding 218-run lead.""This boy's is special. Looking at where he's come from, the way he's been batting and handling fame, it's not easy sometimes to handle fame,"" Gavaskar said after the end of the day's play.""Against England, he scored more than 700 runs in five Test matches, two double-hundreds earlier in the year. And he looks so hungry for runs, which is what you want as a batter.""A lot of us were told, get a hundred. I think he says, I want to get a 150 or 200. He's hungry for runs, and that's exactly what Indian cricket needs,"" he told Star Sports.The former India captain noted that Jaiswal's aggressive batting style, particularly as a left-hander at the top of the order, is a challenge for opposition bowlers. He praised the confidence Jaiswal displayed, particularly against Starc, where his shot selection demonstrated his growing composure and ability to play with freedom.""A left-hander who at the top of the order can create problems for the bowlers, whether they're Australian, English, whatever, because he brings a completely different perspective,"" said the former captain.""He likes to play his shots. He's not one of those really ultra-watchful batters. He'll play his shots. Some of the shots that he played off Mitchell Starc tell you the confidence that he has. So clearly, I think, Yashasvi Jaiswal, has the cricketing world at his feet.""Former Australia opener Matthew Hayden lauded Jaiswal for his ""absolute calmness under pressure"".""It was certainly chalk and cheese. The first innings the way Jaiswal slashed away outside off stump, and that was the dismissal that caused his peril. But when you think of the second innings, you think of just absolute calmness under pressure.""Character was shown in the second innings because he had such good composure. He allowed himself time at the crease. He had the balance and peace of mind to be able to get a good stride into the ball, and then he also allowed himself to bat time with his partner.""Gavaskar also praised KL Rahul for easing pressure on Jaiswal with his solid batting.""When you have a partner at the other end who's looking so secure, like Rahul is doing, then the other partner who's got more strokes, who's a little more adventurous in playing shots, and that's what happened, so Jaiswal has actually flowered in his company.""You can say that because he's seen the solidity of Rahul. Rahul hasn't missed out on his scoring opportunities. When the ball's been pitched up, he's driven it gloriously through the covers.""There is this straight drive that he played off Pat Cummins as well. Brilliant. It's been a very, very good innings. It's been what you would call a proper five-day Test match innings,"" said Gavaskar.","Yashasvi Jaiswal has the 'cricketing world at his feet', says Sunil Gavaskar. Former India captain also praises KL Rahul for easing pressure on the young batsman. On Day 2 of India's second Test against Australia, Ja is unbeaten on 90.

'Inexplicable'

Vigo: La Liga leaders Barcelona suffered a dramatic collapse in a 2-2 draw at Celta Vigo on Saturday.Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski's goals put the Catalans in a healthy position but Marc Casado's red card in the 82nd minute helped Celta snatch a point.Alfonso Gonzalez capitalised on a Jules Kounde error to pull a goal back before Hugo Alvarez levelled two minutes later.Barcelona have won 11 league games this season but this became the third they have failed to take three points from without teenage winger Lamine Yamal.Coach Hansi Flick said he would challenge his side to win without the injured 17-year-old wing wizard and it seemed like they were managing it until their spectacular late crumble.Barcelona are five points clear of Atletico Madrid at the top of La Liga, with champions Real Madrid, third, playing on Sunday at Leganes.""We had the game under control but the red card had a big impact on us and they scored two goals in two moves and we have to learn from that,"" Barcelona midfielder Gavi told DAZN.""The first goal was so stupid, we have to clear the ball there, but it's football and we have to learn from it, with one man less it's hard.""Gavi made his first start in over a year after recovering from a severe knee injury.""I'm happy, after a year, but the truth is the important thing was the three points and it wasn't possible,"" added the 20-year-old.Flick shifted Raphinha into Yamal's position on the right, using Dani Olmo on the left and Pedri in attacking midfield.Raphinha opened the scoring in the 15th minute, slotting home neatly to continue his fine form after Kounde lofted a ball forward for him.Barcelona left-back Gerard Martin was issued an early booking and lived on the edge in the first half, nudging over Iago Aspas as he ran through but just about staying on the right side of the law.The defender then fouled Aspas before half-time and was lucky to escape a second booking as Celta's captain fumed and was issued a yellow card himself for his outburst.Flick brought off Martin at the break for Hector Fort, fearing a potential dismissal.Hunting for Barcelona's second, Lewandowski had produced a fine lobbed finish in the first half but the goal was chalked off for offside.The forward was not to be denied though and just after the hour mark he stroked home Barcelona's second after Raphinha played him in.It was the 36-year-old striker's 15th league goal of the campaign, further extending his vast lead as La Liga's top scorer.Inaki Pena made a handful of saves for Barcelona, denying Hugo Alvarez with his leg.Raphinha could have killed the game off completely but the winger hit the post with a low effort after being sent through.The Catalans were reduced to 10 men after 82 minutes when recent Spain debutant Casado picked up his second yellow card for fouling former Barca midfielder Ilaix Moriba.It restored Celta's belief and moments later they pulled one back when Kounde dallied on the ball in his own area and Gonzalez picked his pocket and finished past Pena.Two minutes later Alvarez levelled for Celta as Barcelona collapsed, cutting in from the right and finishing clinically to snatch a point.Celta, 11th, have a strong record at Balaidos against Barcelona in recent years and the players celebrated with their fans at the end of the game.""We found ourselves with that red card and the (first) goal, and then the second came, it's inexplicable,"" said a delighted Alvarez.""We got the draw, we wanted more -- this team has great quality.""",Barcelona held to a 2-2 draw by Celta Vigo in La Liga on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Tottenham delivered a crushing 4-0 victory at the Etihad, ending Manchester City 's impressive 52-game unbeaten home streak on Sunday.The first half saw James Maddison score twice within seven minutes, followed by Pedro Porro's goal against his previous club and Brennan Johnson's finishing touch to complete the victory.This defeat, City's first at home from open play since before the 2022 World Cup, leaves them trailing Premier League leaders Liverpool by five points. Liverpool have a game remaining against bottom-placed Southampton on Sunday.The victory provides relief for Tottenham and Ange Postecoglou as they advance into the top six positions.Despite recently extending his contract until 2027, Pep Guardiola faces the challenge of addressing the worst performance streak in his managerial career.The anticipated revival of the four-time consecutive Premier League champions following Guardiola's new contract failed to materialise.Before the match, Rodri displayed his Ballon d'Or trophy to supporters, with his name illuminated across the Etihad pitch.The Spanish midfielder, aged 28, is sidelined for the remainder of the season due to knee ligament damage sustained in September, and his absence has significantly affected City's performance.City began positively with Guglielmo Vicario stopping Erling Haaland's attempt, followed by another deflected shot from the Norwegian.The match's direction shifted dramatically with Tottenham's first serious offensive move after 13 minutes.Dejan Kulusevski provided an excellent cross to Maddison, who finished with precision.Recently excluded from Postecoglou's starting lineup, Maddison was determined to demonstrate his worth.Son Heung-min's creative pass enabled the England player to score his second goal, lifting the ball over the advancing Ederson.Tottenham's season has been marked by fluctuating performances.Following a 2-1 home loss to Ipswich before the international break, which dropped them to 10th position, they have now secured two significant victories in Manchester, including a 3-0 win at Old Trafford.Ederson made an excellent save to prevent Dominic Solanke from scoring before halftime.Seven minutes into the second half, Kulusevski's cross found Solanke, who assisted Porro's powerful close-range finish.Haaland nearly scored from an acute angle, hitting the crossbar as City struggled to respond.The final blow came when Timo Werner outpaced Kyle Walker and crossed for Johnson to score at the far post. Kevin De Bruyne 's return as a late substitute after two months offers City some optimism.However, Guardiola must find quick solutions to maintain their title defence, with a challenging visit to Anfield next, where City haven't won before spectators since 2003.","Tottenham beat Manchester City 4-0 at the Etihad on Sunday.

KOCHI: Kerala Blasters hope to arrest their downward spiral when they face an in-form Chennaiyin FC in the Indian Super League at Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium , Kochi, on Sunday.Chennaiyin are placed fourth in the ISL standings with three victories, three draws, and a couple of defeats. In contrast, the Blasters are languishing in tenth place and have just two wins all season. They are going into the match after suffering a hat-trick of losses.The Blasters’ current predicament is largely due to injuries and the form of several key players. Their offensive capabilities were hampered following Noah Sadoui's injury during their defeat against Bengaluru FC.Adrian Luna, the Blasters’ stalwart in recent seasons, looks a pale shadow of himself after returning from injury. Despite earnest efforts from Jesus Jimenez and Kwame Peprah in attack, they haven’t received adequate support up front. Kerala Blasters FC head coach Mikael Stahre said that his team needs to fix some defensive issues, but highlighted an important issue that might have slipped under the radar too.""We have conceded too many goals (16) and we need to find a solution for that. But, it’s not like we’ve conceded too many chances, so that helps, as it would have been worse had we conceded a lot of goal-scoring opportunities as well,"" Stahre said.Chennaiyin FC head coach Owen Coyle expressed his gratitude towards the supporters of Chennaiyin FC who will be travelling for the match against Kerala Blasters FC in Kochi. ""There are a few hundred fans who will be coming for the away game against Kerala Blasters FC. We are thankful for them since they support us everywhere we go. We want to put a smile on their faces and we can do that by winning this difficult game,"" Coyle said.","Chennaiyin are placed fourth in the ISL standings with three victories, three draws, and a couple of defeats.

Alaaeddine Ajaraie could not continue his record-breaking scoring spree to the ninth Indian Super League game. Their defensive strongman Asheer Aktar received his first yellow of the season in a Saturday clash that saw seven yellow cards, and a red.However, it was the resolve and grit of North East United FC that earned them a hard-fought 2-1 victory against Punjab FC in New Delhi, despite playing the second half with 10 men. The win — their 4th in nine games — extended their unbeaten run to four and broke the trend of losing points late on.They had fired in both their goals in the opening 20 minutes with Ajaraie turning provider to Giullermo Hierro’s 15th minute opener and No. 10 Nestor Albiach drilling in the second with a perfect volley in the 18th minute. The win propelled Juan Pedro Benali ’s men to the third spot with 15 points — two points behind new leaders Mohun Bagan Super Giants , who went atop beating Jamshedpur FC 3-0 at the Saltlake stadium in Saturday’s second game, and Bengaluru FC.Benali stuck to his preferred 4-2-3-1 formation as Punjab FC adopted a physical approach from the outset to disrupt NEUFC’s attacking force with the referee brandishing three yellow cards – two to Punjab and one to NEUFC defender Dinesh Singh – within the opening 10 minutes, reflecting the intense nature of the contest.Ajaraie had his first shot on goal — his 45th of the ISL season and the only one of the game — in the 9th minute, but it was in the 15th minute that NEUFC broke the deadlock. Macarton Nickson sent a cross from midfield to Alaaeddine on the left side of the box, and the Moroccan delivered a precise cross at the goalmouth for the onrushing Gillermo to guide into the net.Just three minutes later, the Highlanders had doubled their lead. Winger Buanthanglun Samte, who enjoyed ample space on the left flank, sent a cross into the box, and Albiach was on hand to volley the ball past the Punjab FC goalkeeper Ravi Kumar with precision and power.However, Punjab coach Panagiotis Dilmperis’s words at the half-hour drinks break was heeded by his players as they began attacking in search of an equaliser. Lead striker, Luka Majcen, came close to scoring on a couple of occasions, but the visiting defenders held firm.With the hosts pushing hard, Dinesh earned his second yellow card for an unnecessary foul just outside the box in the 5th minute of first-half added time, reducing NEUFC to 10 men.Punjab earnestly tried to take advantage of their numerical superiority after the change of ends, maintaining most of the possession and registering all shots on target, but their efforts were met by the Highlanders’ defence, led by skipper Miguel Zabaco.Their perseverance, however, paid off in the 88th minute when NEUFC custodian Gurmeet Singh failed to hold on to a shot from Asmir Suljic, and defender Ivan Novoselec was in the right place to score on the rebound, reducing NEUFC’s lead.Despite the late goal, NEUFC held their nerve to secure a crucial three points, keeping their team in the hunt for a top-four finish.","North East United FC beat Punjab FC 2-1 in Indian Super League.

KOLKATA: Mohun Bagan SG moved to the top of Indian Super League standings with a comfortable 3-0 win over Jamshedpur FC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. A Liston Colaco magic on the cusp of half-time on either side of goals from Tom Aldred (15th minute) and Jamie Maclaren (70) handed Jose Molina ’s side their fifth win in eight games.Both Mohun Bagan and Bengaluru FC have 17 points each, but Colaco and Co. are topping the table thanks to a better goal difference. Jamshedpur FC have 12 points.While Mohun Bagan’s progress under Molina is on the upswing, it’s another blow to the faltering Jamshedpur FC. Khalid Jamil’s team which had won four of their first five matches, has now suffered three losses in a row, conceding 13 goals. Jamil was suspended from the match but his assistant Steven Dias could do little to stop the team from going into a free fall.Before the kick-off, Mohun Bagan fans group Mariners Arena unveiled a giant tifo paying a tribute to the club’s foreign players and their family members. And Molina’s brigade lived up to expectations with a clinical and confidence-oozing performance.Mohun Bagan deservedly went ahead in the 15th minute with a number of players involved in the lead-up to the goal. A Petratos corner was initially cleared out of the Jamshedpur FC box. But Deepak Tangri, starting in place of injured Asish Rai, took an ambitious shot from outside the box. As the ball bounced off a JFC defender’s feet and went up in air, Alberto Rodriguez headed it on the path of fellow defender and Aldred came up with an acrobatic half-volley beating the goalkeeper all ends up.Albino, however, denied Petratos and Liston with a couple of alert saves in quick succession but when Bagan’s No. 17 came calling in the first-half injury time, he could only watch hopelessly how the rival left the defence in shreds.Having received the ball from Manvir Singh, Liston cast his spell on the entire JFC defence in no time. On entering the box, his body feints were jaw-dropping as he took the challenges from Jamshedpur’s Tangkhulnao, Stephen Eze and Subham Sarangi in his stride one after another with wonderfully executed fakes and feints before coolly placing the ball in past a hapless Albino.That goal virtually killed the game as a contest. Although JFC tried to generate some semblance of fight after the break, the man-of-the-match Manvir came up with another assist following Tangri’s long ball, rounding the goalkeeper and laying it for Maclaren to tap it into an open net.",Mohun Bagan SG moved to the top of Indian Super League standings with a comfortable 3-0 win over Jamshedpur FC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.

Chelsea secured a 2-1 victory against Leicester City at the King Power Stadium , moving them closer to the top of the Premier League table.Nicolas Jackson and Enzo Fernandez scored for Chelsea, while Jordan Ayew netted a late penalty for Leicester.Chelsea's win, their first after two consecutive draws, propels them to 22 points, trailing league leaders Manchester City by a single point and maintaining a three-point advantage over fourth-placed Arsenal.Leicester City manager Enzo Maresca expressed his pride in his team's performance despite the limited preparation time following the international break.“The only thing I asked the players before the game, I said, 'Guys, we have the chance today to make a statement in terms of (who) we are',” he told TNT Sports.“Because when you play this kind of game, all the clubs that they are behind, like in this moment, I don't know, Arsenal or Villa or Brighton or (Manchester) United, Tottenham, they are watching.“They are waiting for us to drop points. And we show that we are there. And we're going to compete until the end and then we'll see where we arrive.”The match marked Maresca's return to the King Power Stadium, where he guided Leicester City back to the Premier League in his sole season with the club.Chelsea dominated the early stages, with Joao Felix, making his first Premier League start of the season, testing the Leicester defense.Chelsea's breakthrough came when Nicolas Jackson outmuscled Leicester defender Wout Faes, receiving a pass from Enzo Fernandez and slotting the ball home for his seventh league goal of the season.Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen denied Noni Madueke, and Madueke had a goal ruled out for offside in the first half.Leicester grew into the game, creating chances through Oliver Skipp and Wilfred Ndidi.Chelsea had an opportunity to extend their lead early in the second half but failed to convert a golden opportunity, with Madueke inadvertently blocking Cole Palmer's goal-bound shot.Fernandez eventually doubled Chelsea's lead, heading in after Hermansen saved Jackson's header.Leicester substitute Stephy Mavididi had a penalty appeal turned down before fellow substitute Jordan Ayew converted a penalty in stoppage time.The penalty proved to be a mere consolation for Leicester, who remain precariously close to the relegation zone, just three points above the drop zone.","Chelsea beat Leicester City 2-1 at the King Power Stadium.

CHENNAI: Irfan Yadwad ’s rise in Indian football over the last few years has been nothing short of remarkable. In 2020, the young forward was asked to contemplate quitting the sport after enduring a meniscus injury in a local tournament in Chandor, Goa.But Irfan recovered from the setback and kept going, thanks to relentless support from his father. It took him only a couple of years to break into the top flight, with his stellar performances at I-League 2 (third tier) club FC Bengaluru United not going unnoticed.While the 23-year-old had a slow start to life at Chennaiyin FC , he has gathered pace in the ongoing Indian Super League season. Irfan, under the guidance of Chennaiyin head coach Owen Coyle, proved to be impactful in the first phase of ISL 2024-25 and it was enough to convince national team manager Manolo Marquez to call him up.Dream turned into reality when Irfan made his India debut and led the line in the recent friendly against Malaysia in Hyderabad. “The journey has been great. It has been about my hard work,” Irfan told TOI ahead of CFC’s away ISL fixture against Kerala Blasters FC in Kochi.“About four years ago, I was out of football for three months after suffering a meniscus injury. My mother cried every day and asked me not to continue playing. It was tough to get my rhythm back. But my father pushed me every day, saying that I can play (at a high level). From that day, everything that I have been doing has been for my family. My parents dreamt of seeing me in the national team. Now, they are proud of me,” added Irfan, owner of a goal and two assists in eight appearances in the current ISL campaign.Irfan could not get on the scoresheet in his maiden outing in India blue, but earned praise from Manolo, who said: “He played a good game. He is a player with a very good future.”Talking about his first experience in the national team, Irfan said: “It was a great feeling. Manolo asked me to do what I have been doing at Chennaiyin. After a few training sessions, he told me that I would start. This is just the beginning (of the India journey). I want to do more for myself and my family. I want to make it to the India team again and again.”Coyle, a forward in his playing days, has had a huge influence on Irfan’s rapid rise. “This season, Owen has given me a new role as a winger. It has been great working with him, he knows my feeling because of how hard I have been working in every session. He trusts me a lot and speaks to me regularly, which helps me improve.”",Irfan Yadwad made his India debut against Malaysia in a friendly. The 23-year- old forward has been in fine form for Chennaiyin FC this season.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian football icon Neymar Jr has added a jewel to his real estate crown—a breathtaking penthouse in Dubai’s Bugatti Residences .Worth an astounding Rs 456 crore, this opulent property redefines luxury living.Located in one of Dubai's most prestigious addresses, Neymar’s new abode boasts unparalleled amenities that seamlessly blend sophistication with comfort.The penthouse includes a private pool that offers panoramic views of Dubai’s glittering skyline, a state-of-the-art fitness centre for his rigorous training routines, and interiors that reflect elegance and grandeur.Floor-to-ceiling windows flood the space with natural light, while the finest finishes and furniture exude refinement. From a rooftop terrace to private elevators, Neymar’s penthouse is truly a testament to world-class luxury.Despite his lavish lifestyle, Neymar’s football career has faced turbulent times.Rumours swirled recently about a potential move to Brazilian club Palmeiras, but the club’s president, Leila Pereira, dismissed the speculation, stating, “Neymar will not join Palmeiras; this club isn’t a medical department.” Her statement was a thinly veiled critique of Neymar’s ongoing injury concerns.Currently signed with Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal, Neymar has struggled with injuries since his high-profile $90 million transfer in August 2023.Most recently, a muscle injury during an AFC Champions League match added to his woes, forcing an early exit after just two appearances in the competition.Although Al-Hilal coach Jorge Jesus clarified that the injury wasn’t related to Neymar’s previous knee issues, it has extended his sidelining.Neymar remains optimistic, sharing on social media, “Hopefully nothing too much. After one year out, this happens.” However, with only seven matches under his belt since joining Al-Hilal, questions about his future with the club are intensifying.","Neymar Jr has added a breathtaking penthouse in Dubai’s Bugatti Residences.

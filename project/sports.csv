Poll What do you think is the significance of Amol Muzumdar's coaching victory? A turning point for women's cricket A personal redemption for Muzumdar An inspiration for future players Only a temporary success

Life has come full circle for Amol Muzumdar . The Mumbai stalwart is one of the greatest cricketers, who never got to play for India.After years of toiling in domestic cricket and amassing over 11,167 first-class runs without ever donning the India cap, Muzumdar has scripted a poetic twist to his story.As a youngster he announced himself as the next big thing, scoring 260 on his Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai. Sadly, he played in an era when India’s middle order was packed with icons — Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, and Sourav Ganguly. In 2014, he retired from first-class cricket, ending an illustrious career that spanned 21 years.Eleven years after his retirement, the man who once carried Mumbai’s batting on his shoulders now stands tall as the coach who guided India’s women to their maiden ODI World Cup triumph.Head coach Amol Muzumdar was overcome with emotion as India lifted their first-ever ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup title, describing the triumph as a “watershed moment” that will redefine the future of Indian cricket “I’m speechless. Absolutely proud. They deserve every bit of this moment,” he said after the match. “The hard work, the belief — they’ve made every Indian proud.”Muzumdar, who took charge of the national side in 2023, praised his team’s resilience and unity throughout the tournament.“We never let early setbacks define us,” he said. “We dominated most matches but just needed to finish better. Once we did that, there was no looking back.”India’s triumph was built on a complete team performance led by 21-year-old Shafali Verma, whose all-round brilliance — a fluent 87 with the bat and two key wickets — set the tone for the night.“One word for Shafali — magical,” Muzumdar said with a smile. “Semi-final, final, packed stadium, all the pressure — she turns up every time. Runs, wickets, catches — she did everything. I couldn’t be prouder.”Muzumdar credited India’s renewed focus on fitness and fielding — a core part of his coaching vision.“That was something we talked about a lot in the dressing room,” he said. “The energy in the field today showed how much they’ve grown. I couldn’t have asked for more.”For Muzumdar — long regarded as one of Indian cricket’s most talented players never to play at the highest level — the win carried deep personal meaning.“It’s a watershed moment,” he said softly. “The ripple effects will be felt for generations.”","Amol Muzumdar was overcome with emotion as India lifted their first-ever ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup title. “I’m speechless.

How Jay Shah pushed for women's cricket, BCCI secretary Saikia explains

Rs 39 crore prize money for Team India

NEW DELHI: In a grand gesture celebrating India’s greatest moment in women’s cricket, the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has announced a record-breaking Rs 51 crore cash reward for the triumphant Indian team that lifted the ICC Women’s World Cup 2025 on Sunday in Navi Mumbai. The prize, which includes players, coaches, and support staff, marks one of the most significant rewards in Indian sporting history.BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia, speaking to ANI, hailed the win as a moment that will transform the landscape of Indian cricket.“In 1983, Kapil Dev brought about a new era and encouragement in cricket by making India win the World Cup. The same excitement and encouragement has been introduced by the women today. Harmanpreet Kaur and her team have not just won the trophy today; they have won the hearts of all Indians,” Saikia said.He added that the victory would inspire “the next generation of women cricketers” and described it as a monumental step for the sport.Saikia also credited Jay Shah, ICC Chairman and former BCCI secretary, for his continued push toward gender equality in cricket.“Since Jay Shah took charge of the BCCI, he has brought about many transformations in women’s cricket. Pay parity was addressed. Last month, ICC Chairman Jay Shah increased women’s prize money by 300 percent — from $2.88 million to $14 million.These steps have greatly promoted women’s cricket. BCCI has also announced a reward prize of Rs 51 crores for the entire team- players, coaches, and support staff,” he noted.In addition to the BCCI’s reward, the Indian team will also receive USD 4.48 million (Rs 39.78 crore) from the International Cricket Council (ICC) — the highest-ever prize money in the history of the sport. The total tournament pool of USD 13.88 million (Rs 123 crore) represents a 297 percent jump from the 2022 edition, underlining the rapid global rise of women’s cricket.As Harmanpreet Kaur and her fearless team basked in their historic triumph over South Africa, the dual windfalls — from the ICC and BCCI — stood as fitting recognition for a group of women who have inspired a nation and redefined the future of Indian cricket.","The BCCI has announced a record-breaking Rs 51 crore cash reward for the triumphant Indian team.

Harmanpreet Kaur on World Cup final: 'Look forward to see women's cricket in a more serious manner'

Pratika Rawal could not stop smiling through her tears as India lifted their first-ever ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup trophy at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday night. The 24-year-old opener, ruled out of the tournament after suffering an ankle injury in the final group-stage match against Bangladesh, was there to celebrate with her teammates — in her wheelchair, wrapped in the Indian flag.It was a bittersweet night for Pratika, who had been in sensational form before her injury. She finished as India’s second-highest run-getter in the tournament with 308 runs, including a century and a fifty, playing a key role in India’s journey to the final. Her absence was deeply felt, but in a beautiful twist of fate, her replacement Shafali Verma emerged as the hero of the final, smashing 87 runs to help India post a formidable 298 for 7 against South Africa.After India sealed a 52-run victory, Pratika joined the celebrations from the sidelines. She was seen cheering every moment, waving the tricolour proudly, and later joined her teammates on the field for the post-match group photograph. The team made sure she was at the centre of it all, posing with her in the wheelchair alongside the gleaming trophy.Overwhelmed by emotion, Pratika said, “I can’t even express it. There are no words.This flag on my shoulder means so much. To be here with my team — it’s surreal. Injuries are part of the game, but I’m just so happy I could still be part of this team. I love this team. I can’t express what I feel — we actually did it! We’re the first Indian team to win the World Cup in so long. The whole of India deserves this. Honestly, it was harder to watch than to play. Every wicket, every boundary — it gave me goosebumps. The energy, the crowd, the emotion — it was incredible.”Click here to watch: Pratika Rawal’s dance with Jemimah and Harman after India’s win In one of the most heartwarming moments of the night, Pratika was seen dancing on her wheelchair with Jemimah Rodrigues and captain Harmanpreet Kaur , celebrating the historic victory with a joyful bhangra.

How Jay Shah pushed for women's cricket, BCCI secretary Saikia explains

NEW DELHI: As the adage goes, “Every dark night follows a new bright sunrise.” On Sunday, India witnessed that very sunrise — one that erased the haunting memories of November 19, 2023. Two years after the men's team's crushing defeat to Australia in the ODI World Cup final at Ahmedabad, the Indian women's team, led by Harmanpreet Kaur , scripted a historic redemption story, lifting their maiden ICC Women's World Cup trophy in Navi Mumbai.The emotional contrast between those two Novembers couldn't have been starker. The visuals of a teary-eyed Rohit Sharma and a gutted Virat Kohli in 2023 were forever etched into India's collective sporting memory. But on November 2, 2025, the sight of Harmanpreet's elated leap and her team's joyous embrace at DY Patil Stadium became the healing balm for those old wounds.Capturing that sentiment perfectly, IPL franchise Delhi Capitals posted a poignant montage blending the heartbreak of 2023 with the jubilation of 2025, captioned simply: “For every Nov 19, there's Nov 2.” The video went viral, echoing across a billion hearts that had waited too long for redemption.India's women delivered a performance worthy of that emotion — posting 298 for 7, powered by Shafali Verma's sparkling 87 and Deepti Sharma 's all-round brilliance (55 and 5/39), before bowling out South Africa for 246 to clinch a 52-run victory.As AR Rahman's “Vande Mataram” filled the night air, Harmanpreet sealed the moment by catching Nadine de Klerk — and commentator Ian Bishop's words, “inspiring generations,” perfectly captured the occasion's poetry.For Rohit Sharma, watching from the stands, the win must have carried extra meaning. For Harmanpreet, who herself felt the sting of losing a World Cup final eight years ago, it was redemption of the sweetest kind.If June 25, 1983 marked the birth of India's cricketing dreams, November 2, 2025 may well mark the rise of a new era — one led by eleven fearless women whose triumph will inspire generations of girls to dream with bat and ball.",India's women's team beat South Africa by 52 runs to win ICC Women's World Cup.

South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt expressed pride in her team's Women's World Cup 2025 campaign despite losing the final to India at DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai on Sunday. She also revealed that veteran player Marizanne Kapp would be retiring from World Cup cricket while praising India's Shafali Verma's outstanding batting performance in India's 52-run victory.India secured their first-ever ICC Women's World Cup title by defeating first-time finalists South Africa in a clinical display.""I could not be prouder of this team for the campaign we had. Brilliant cricket throughout, but outplayed today by India. Unfortunate to be on the losing side, but we will definitely grow from this. We did so well to put those couple of bad games behind us. We were either really good or really bad, but thankfully more of the really good. Amazing tournament for a lot of the players, and proud of the resilience we showed,"" Wolvaardt said after the match.Discussing her dual role as captain and batter, Wolvaardt shared her initial struggles and subsequent adaptation. ""Probably did not have my best year leading into the World Cup and did not start it well. Overthinking, it was not good. It is just another game of cricket, trying to separate the two, and that sort of freed me up a bit to play my natural game and then focus on the captaincy at a different time,"" she explained.Wolvaardt commented on the match conditions and praised Shafali Verma's performance. ""We were hoping for a little bit more swing. There was still something in it, so still feel it was the right call to bowl. We were in it for a lot of the chase but lost too many wickets. I kept checking Shafali. She batted excellently. That is the way she plays. When it comes off, she can really hurt teams,"" she said.Speaking about Marizanne Kapp's retirement, Wolvaardt said: ""She has been phenomenal for so many editions. Really sad it is going to be her last one. The whole group wanted to win it for her. She is two players in one and very happy she is on our team.""Wolvaardt herself had an exceptional tournament, scoring 101 off 98 balls in the final and finishing as the highest run-getter in a single World Cup edition with 571 runs in 9 innings at an average of 71.37.Her World Cup career statistics now stand at 1,328 runs in 24 matches, including two hundreds and 12 half-centuries, approaching New Zealand legend Debbie Hockley's record of 1,501 runs.Wolvaardt has set a new record for the most 50-plus scores in Women's World Cup history with 14 such innings in 24 matches, surpassing accomplished players like Mithali Raj , Debbie Hockley, and Charlotte Edwards.",South Africa lost the Women's World Cup final to India by 52 runs.

Joao Pedro lifts Chelsea to glory against Spurs



Liverpool secured a 2-0 victory against Aston Villa in the Premier League , ending their four-game losing streak. Mohamed Salah achieved his 250th goal for the club, and Ryan Gravenberch added another goal to help the defending champions move up to third place in the standings.""I'm glad we are back on track now. It's a very tricky season for us because we have a few new players, they are very good players, but they need time to adapt. We lost some players too. It takes time to adapt and know each other's games, but everything will be fine,"" said Salah.Liverpool manager Arne Slot's decision to make multiple changes during Wednesday's 3-0 League Cup loss to Crystal Palace increased pressure on the returning players to secure a win after six defeats in seven games across all competitions.""What I liked most was that I think everybody here felt the importance of the game. I'm talking about my players and I'm talking about the fans. From start to finish the players showed up,"" said Slot.Liverpool faced early pressure when Morgan Rogers hit the post with a shot after five minutes. This continued their pattern of struggling in the opening 15 minutes, which had been evident in their previous four Premier League defeats.Villa initially showed strength in breaking through Liverpool's defense but later struggled with their own defensive play. Dominik Szoboszlai missed an opportunity after taking the ball from Pau Torres, shooting directly at Martinez.Hugo Ekitike's header goal was disallowed after VAR review showed he was offside from Szoboszlai's cross. Martinez's error then allowed Salah to score just before half-time, marking his 250th goal for Liverpool.Salah's goal, his fifth of the season, places him as Liverpool's third-highest scorer in club history, behind only Ian Rush and Roger Hunt. The goal also ended Liverpool's streak of conceding first in seven consecutive games.Villa entered the match having won their previous four league games, including victories over Tottenham and Manchester City. They were level on points with Liverpool before the game.Gravenberch, who had missed the previous weekend's 3-2 loss at Brentford due to an ankle injury, scored Liverpool's second goal. His shot deflected off Pau Torres, deceiving Martinez.Liverpool achieved their first clean sheet in 11 games. The team now prepares for upcoming matches against Real Madrid in the Champions League and Manchester City in the Premier League.Liverpool's recent poor form has created a significant challenge in their title defence against Arsenal. The victory reduced their gap behind Arsenal to seven points, providing a starting point for their return to the title race.Joao Pedro ended his goal drought for Chelsea by scoring the decisive goal in a 1-0 victory against Tottenham at their home stadium on Saturday.The Brazilian striker scored his first goal since August 30, when he last found the net against Fulham, breaking a nine-game goalless streak across all competitions.Since his £60 million transfer from Brighton during the transfer window, the 24-year-old has only managed to score three times for Chelsea.Chelsea moved to fourth place in the Premier League standings after securing their third win in four matches, trailing Tottenham only on goal difference.Tottenham's struggles at home continue, as they haven't secured a victory at their stadium since defeating Burnley in the season opener in August.Their poor home form in 2025 began under previous manager Ange Postecoglou and has persisted under Frank's leadership.Despite a League Cup defeat at Newcastle, Tottenham's away performances have been stronger, including a convincing 3-0 win at Everton in their last league match.Tottenham supporters are showing increasing dissatisfaction with Frank's tactical approach, which differs from the club's traditional attacking philosophy.An early setback occurred when Lucas Bergvall suffered a head injury and was replaced by Xavi Simons as a concussion substitute.Bergvall showed resistance to the medical staff's decision, pushing one of them before Frank stepped in to calm the situation.Alejandro Garnacho posed Chelsea's primary attacking threat in the first half, testing Tottenham goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario with long-range attempts.Vicario recovered from a knee injury to make a crucial save, denying Joao Pedro after a defensive error by Pedro Porro.Joao Pedro broke the deadlock in the 34th minute, capitalising on Moises Caicedo's pressure on Simons and Van de Ven to score from close range.Frank expressed his frustration with Tottenham's defensive errors by kicking a water bottle on the sideline.Joao Pedro nearly doubled his tally, but Vicario saved his powerful shot following Malo Gusto's assist.Rodrigo Bentancur received a yellow card for a challenge on Reece James, which could have warranted a more severe punishment.Mohammed Kudus tested Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez just before halftime, but his shot was well saved.After the break, Enzo Fernandez missed a clear opportunity, heading over from James' cross from ten yards out.Tottenham's possession problems continued in the second half, leading to growing frustration among their supporters.Vicario was forced to make another save from Pedro Neto's powerful attempt, while Tottenham failed to mount a serious comeback in the closing stages.",Liverpool secured a 2-0 victory against Aston Villa in the Premier League.

Arsenal put more distance between them and the rest at the top of the Premier League table with a composed 2-0 victory over Burnley on Saturday, extending their winning run in the competition to five matches.The result pushed Mikel Arteta’s men seven points clear at the summit and further strengthened their bid to end a two-decade wait for the league title. Viktor Gyokeres opened the scoring with a well-timed header from Declan Rice’s corner in the first half, marking his first league goal since mid-September.Rice then doubled Arsenal’s advantage in the 35th minute, heading home from close range to give the visitors firm control at Turf Moor. Arsenal’s threat from set-pieces once again proved decisive, while their defensive record remained formidable, having conceded just three league goals in ten games this season.Arteta praised the balance in his side’s performances, saying his players had “shown maturity in difficult away games” and were “playing with a real sense of control.” The Gunners have now won nine straight games across all competitions, maintaining a consistent rhythm on both ends of the pitch.Burnley rarely threatened and remain in the bottom three, struggling to find form at home. Arsenal, meanwhile, continue to set the pace in the title race with another confident display built on discipline and precision. Manchester United were held to a 2-2 draw by Nottingham Forest in a tense contest at the City Ground, despite leading twice.Casemiro put United ahead in the first half, giving Ruben Amorim’s side hope of a fourth straight league win. However, Forest, who had not scored a league goal since September 20, produced a spirited response after the break.Morgan Gibbs-White equalised in the 48th minute with a strong header before Nicolo Savona completed a quick turnaround just two minutes later. United were forced to chase the game and eventually found a late equaliser through Amad Diallo, whose sharp volley in the 81st minute ensured the points were shared.Amorim later said his team “created enough to win” but admitted Forest “showed great character.” For Forest, manager Sean Dyche said he was “pleased with the fight shown,” though the result keeps them in the relegation zone, four points adrift of safety.United stay within reach of the top four but were left ruing missed chances in a match that tested their recent resurgence.",Manchester United were held to a 2-2 draw by Nottingham Forest.

Poll Is Liverpool's season salvageable after the recent defeats? Yes, they can turn it around No, it's too late Maybe, depends on next few games

Liverpool’s season went from bad to worse on Wednesday night as they crashed out of the League Cup following a stunning 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Anfield — their sixth loss in the last seven matches across all competitions.Ismaila Sarr struck twice before halftime and Yeremy Pino added a late third, as Palace inflicted yet another humiliation on Arne Slot’s struggling side. The defeat compounds Liverpool’s growing crisis, coming just days after their 3-2 Premier League loss to Brentford, which further derailed their title defence.Slot’s decision to rest several key players — including Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz — backfired spectacularly. With one eye on crucial fixtures against Aston Villa, Real Madrid and Manchester City, the Dutchman fielded a largely second-string team featuring teenagers Kieran Morrison, Rio Ngumoha and Trey Nyoni.“It’s not Liverpool standards to lose six out of seven,” Slot admitted after the match. “But with the squad we have — maybe 15, 16 fit first-team players — this was the choice I had to make. The schedule is brutal, and next week will be even tougher.”The weakened lineup struggled to keep up with Palace’s intensity. Joe Gomez’s defensive lapse allowed Sarr to open the scoring in the 41st minute, before the Senegalese winger doubled the lead just moments before halftime from Pino’s assist. Substitute Amara Nallo’s late red card only deepened Liverpool’s woes, and Pino’s composed finish in the 88th minute sealed the emphatic win.The result means Palace have now beaten Liverpool three times in 80 days — following their Community Shield shootout win and a 2-1 Premier League victory.Liverpool’s latest defeat leaves Slot under increasing pressure as the club’s season threatens to unravel. With top players out of form, mounting injuries, and growing fan frustration, the next two weeks — featuring clashes against Villa, Madrid and City — could define the fate of his debut campaign.Meanwhile, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle all advanced to the quarter-finals after securing wins in their respective ties.","Liverpool crashed out of the League Cup following a 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace.

Poll Do you think Vinicius Junior's reaction to being substituted was justified? Yes, emotions are part of the game No, he should control his emotions

Brazilian forward Vinicius Junior has apologised to Real Madrid and its supporters following his angry reaction to being substituted during the side’s 2-1 win over Barcelona in the El Clasico on Sunday.The forward, who was replaced by Rodrygo in the 72nd minute, reacted visibly on the touchline and was seen heading straight down the tunnel after exchanging words with coach Xabi Alonso. He later returned to the sidelines before the final whistle.On Tuesday, the 25-year-old addressed the incident with a statement expressing regret for his behaviour.“Today I want to apologise to all Madrid fans for my reaction to being substituted in the Clasico. Just as I have already done it in person during today's training, I also want to apologise again to my teammates, club and president,” Vinicius said.He admitted that emotions had taken over in the heat of the moment.“Sometimes passion gets the better of me by always wanting to win and help my team. My competitive nature is born from the love I feel for this club and for everything it represents,” he added.Vinicius also reaffirmed his commitment to the club and its values.“I promise to continue fighting every second for the good of Real Madrid, as I have done since day one,” he said.Alonso, speaking after the game, had played down the episode, saying the matter would be handled internally within the dressing room.The Brazilian’s reaction came during a tense contest at the Santiago Bernabeu, where Madrid secured a narrow victory over their arch-rivals. Vinicius was also involved in a brief confrontation with Lamine Yamal late in the match as tempers flared.The win extended Real Madrid’s strong start to the season, though Vinicius’s apology now appears to have drawn a line under the brief moment of controversy.",Vinicius Junior has apologised to Real Madrid and its supporters.

Drake Maye breaks Patrick Mahomes ’ historic NFL streak



Patrick Mahomes struggles as Chiefs stumble against Bills



More coverage on NFL:

The New England Patriots continued their dominant streak on Sunday, edging past the Atlanta Falcons 24-23 in a thrilling finish that came down to a missed extra point. Rookie kicker Parker Romo’s failed PAT after Michael Penix’s late touchdown left the Falcons one point short, sealing the Patriots’ sixth straight victory and pushing them to a 7-2 record this season.In the win, second-year quarterback Drake Maye once again proved why he’s one of the NFL’s brightest young stars. The 23-year-old completed 19 of 29 passes for 259 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception, earning a 102.5 passer rating against one of the league’s top defenses. Supported by a balanced run game and sharp route running from receivers Stefon Diggs and Demario “Pop” Douglas, Maye controlled the pace in the first half before holding firm as the Falcons rallied late.Drake Maye didn’t just lead his team to another win — he also etched his name in the record books. His 259-yard, two-touchdown outing marked his eighth consecutive game with at least 200 passing yards and a passer rating of 100 or higher. That performance allowed Maye to surpass Patrick Mahomes for the longest such streak by a quarterback under 24 years old.Mahomes originally set the benchmark back in 2018, his first MVP season, when he achieved those numbers in seven straight games between Weeks 6 and 13.Now, Maye stands alone atop that category, rewriting what’s possible for young quarterbacks.As NFL+ noted on X, “Drake Maye passes Patrick Mahomes for the longest streak of games with 200+ pass yards and a 100+ passer rating by a player under the age of 24 all-time (8) ✅.”Maye’s consistency through nine games has been exceptional — throwing for 2,285 yards, 17 touchdowns, and just four interceptions. His poise under pressure and precise decision-making have turned the Patriots’ offense into one of the most efficient in the league.While Maye is soaring, Patrick Mahomes faced one of his toughest outings of the season. The Kansas City Chiefs dropped to 5-4 after a 28-21 loss to the Buffalo Bills, with Mahomes completing only 44.1% of his passes for 250 yards, one interception, and minimal ground gain.The Chiefs will regroup during their Week 10 bye, but Maye and the Patriots are already shifting focus to their next challenge — a road matchup against Baker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. With history now on his side, Maye’s rise continues to capture the league’s attention.","Drake Maye sets new NFL record surpassing Patrick Mahomes for passing consistency under age 24.

How serious is Tucker Kraft’s knee injury as Packers confirm it ‘does not look good’?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/how-serious-is-tucker-krafts-knee-injury-as-packers-confirm-it-does-not-look-good/articleshow/125044656.cms,"Tucker Kraft injury update (Getty Images)

Tucker Kraft injury update from Matt LaFleur



What’s next for the Packers after Tucker Kraft’s injury?



More updates on NFL

The Green Bay Packers' loss to the Carolina Panthers wasn’t just another disappointing result—it came with a gut-wrenching twist. Star tight end Tucker Kraft suffered a severe knee injury that could potentially end his season. The home crowd at Lambeau Field watched in silence as Kraft clutched his right knee after an awkward collision with guard Sean Rhyan during the third quarter. Moments later, he was helped off the field and carted to the locker room, leaving fans and teammates deeply concerned.The 16-13 loss to Carolina quickly became secondary to the growing worry surrounding Kraft’s condition. The young tight end, one of Jordan Love’s most reliable targets this season, had been a cornerstone of Green Bay’s offense. Before his injury, Kraft had recorded 30 receptions for 469 yards and six touchdowns, emerging as the team’s leading receiver. His absence was immediately felt as the Packers’ offense struggled to find rhythm in the second half.After the game, Head Coach Matt LaFleur offered a somber update that did little to ease concerns. Speaking to reporters, LaFleur admitted that early signs were not encouraging. According to ESPN’s Rob Demovsky, “Packers coach Matt LaFleur TE Kraft’s knee injury ‘does not look good.’”The early fear, confirmed by NFL insider Ian Rapoport, is that Kraft may have torn his ACL. “The fear heading into the MRI is that Kraft tore his ACL, source said. Just brutal,” Rapoport reported.If those fears prove true, Kraft could miss the remainder of the season and possibly part of the next. That would deal a major blow to a Packers offense that has heavily relied on his playmaking ability and consistency in key moments. Even the most optimistic outlook suggests a long road to recovery ahead.With Kraft likely sidelined, Green Bay faces a major challenge in reshaping its offensive strategy. As LaFleur noted, “It’s going to be tough. Other guys are going to have to step up.” The Packers will need to look to their younger talents to fill the void, particularly 2023 second-round pick Luke Musgrave.Musgrave, who lost his starting role to Kraft earlier this season, now has a crucial opportunity to reclaim a central role in the offense. In his rookie season, he tallied 34 catches for 352 yards and a touchdown. Though he has seen limited action since, his athleticism and familiarity with the system make him a prime candidate to step in.For the Packers, Tucker Kraft’s injury is not just a personnel loss—it’s an emotional one. The road ahead will test the team’s depth, adaptability, and spirit as they fight to keep their playoff hopes alive without one of their most dependable stars.",Green Bay Packers star tight end Tucker Kraft suffered a severe knee injury against the Carolina Panthers.

Are Joey Bosa and Nick Bosa Twins ? The Truth Behind Their Bond



Nick Bosa and Joey Bosa talk about brotherhood, growing up in Florida, and not being able to dance

They are best friends for each other



More coverage on NFL:

Nick Bosa and Joey Bosa have redefined what it means to be brothers in the NFL. Few sibling pairs can boast the level of dominance, discipline, and determination that these two bring to the gridiron. When Nick was once asked who the best brothers in the NFL were during Super Bowl LIV media day, his one-word reply summed it all up: “Bosas.” And looking at their careers, it’s hard to argue otherwise.Joey became one of the league’s highest-paid defenders in 2020 with a $135 million contract extension. Three years later, his younger brother Nick surpassed that record, signing a $170 million deal with the San Francisco 49ers. From their uncanny similarities on and off the field to their shared nickname — “Big Bear” and “Smaller Bear” — the Bosa brothers are a force built from both genetics and grit.“It’s hard to explain, but everything we do looks the same,” Nick told the San Francisco Chronicle. “The moves we use, the way we run, the way we walk, the way we stand. Everything just looks similar.”Their mother, Cheryl Bosa, calls it “a genetic phenomenon,” and she might be right.Both brothers are nearly identical in build, technique, and passion — a rare combination that has translated into football greatness.Despite their striking resemblance, Joey and Nick Bosa are not twins. Joey, born in 1995, is two years older than Nick, who arrived in 1997. What truly unites them isn’t age, but legacy. Football runs deep in the Bosa bloodline — spanning generations. Their grandfather Palmer Pyle and great-uncle Mike Pyle both played in the NFL during the 1960s. Their father, John Bosa, was drafted 16th overall by the Miami Dolphins in 1987, followed by their uncle Eric Kumerow the very next year. Their cousin, Jake Kumerow, now plays for the Buffalo Bills.As Nick once proudly said, “We’ve got good genes, man. Good genes.”Joey’s journey began at Ohio State, where he thrived under head coach Urban Meyer. “I said, ‘You know what, if Coach Meyer ends up getting the job, I’ll take a look,’” Joey recalled to FOX College Football. His success inspired Nick, who learned from both Joey and their mentor Larry Johnson long before becoming a Buckeye himself.The brothers made NFL history as top-three draft picks — Joey went third overall in 2016, Nick second overall in 2019 — both earning Defensive Rookie of the Year honors. They even share the same jersey number, 97, carried on from their father. “It’s just a cool tradition. I’d like to keep it going,” Joey told USA Today.Beyond the stats, their relationship is built on brotherhood. “Nick is one of very few people I can be my true self around,” Joey told Sports Illustrated. Once childhood rivals, they now stand as best friends — and two of the most dominant forces the NFL has ever seen.","Nick Bosa and Joey Bosa have redefined what it means to be brothers in the NFL.

The Hunt family presence continues to define the Chiefs’ cultural aesthetic

This subtle style shift may be a preview of a more strategic fashion era

More coverage on NFL:

When Chiefs fans hear the name Gracie Hunt, they typically picture bold gameday glamour, gold Super Bowl dresses, glitter, vivid Chiefs red, bikini-level vacation fits from international stops, and full-volume style energy that usually pulls the spotlight away from whatever is happening on the field.But in Buffalo, she threw curveball energy. Instead of the explosive, ultra-flashy wardrobe viewers have come to expect, Gracie opted for a stealthy black look, something far more minimal, controlled, and intentionally understated. And because of how rare it is for her fashion identity, the unexpected choice drew just as much buzz as the Chiefs’ performance itself. This wasn’t just an outfit, it was a statement that subtleness can still steal the room.Gracie Hunt, the eldest daughter of CEO Clark Hunt, has been a core part of the Chiefs brand ecosystem for years, even if unofficially. She isn’t listed on the sideline depth chart. She isn’t calling plays. But her visual identity has become part of Kansas City’s modern NFL culture just as much as barbeque references, Arrowhead decibels, and Patrick Mahomes’ side-arm throws.This season she opened in Brazil with a look that dominated the conversation.She has done matching fits with Brittany Mahomes. And last year's Super Bowl gold dress, to some fans, eclipsed the actual highlight reel.The black Buffalo fit felt like self-control by someone who already knows she can demand attention without trying.Gracie didn’t just wear black, she anchored it with one detail that mattered: the Chiefs necklace. That was her wink. Her nod. Her signal that she didn’t abandon the brand, she simply refined the delivery.Whether it becomes her “lucky road uniform” remains to be seen, but here’s one certainty: When Gracie Hunt switches gears, NFL fashion culture takes notes.","Gracie Hunt surprised fans in Buffalo by opting for a minimalist black outfit, a departure from her usual bold gameday style.

Cam Little’s parents: The guiding force behind the record-breaker



More coverage on NFL:

Cam Little delivered a jaw-dropping moment on Sunday that left football fans and analysts stunned. The Jacksonville Jaguars kicker shattered an NFL record by nailing a 68-yard field goal to close the first half against the Las Vegas Raiders. The kick, which soared effortlessly through the uprights, surpassed Justin Tucker’s 66-yarder from 2021 — a record many believed would stand for years. Unlike Tucker’s crossbar-clipping miracle, Little’s strike had power, precision, and confidence written all over it.Heading into the matchup, few expected such perfection from the young kicker. Little had missed three of his previous four attempts, including an extra point, casting doubt over his rhythm. But the Jaguars’ coaching staff never wavered in their faith. Their belief paid off spectacularly when Little, who had already made a 70-yarder during the preseason, rose to the occasion under pressure. His previous career best, a 59-yard field goal against the Lions in 2024, now feels like a distant memory. With that 68-yarder, Little didn’t just make history—he redefined what composure under pressure looks like.Behind Cam Little’s record-setting leg are two unwavering supporters — his parents, Todd and Ronda Little. Both have played a quiet yet vital role in shaping his journey. Todd once played football himself, but he stepped away from the sport when coaches pushed him to switch positions in college. Yet, his understanding of the game helped his son find clarity early on. Todd often encouraged Cam to study professional kickers on YouTube to refine his technique and mindset.Off the field, the Littles have always emphasized compassion. Cam’s mother, Ronda, once said, “I think it just aligns with who he is. He has always been supportive of Ayden and his endeavors and making sure he’s treated no differently than other kids.” Ayden, Cam’s cousin, has Down Syndrome and has inspired much of Cam’s charitable involvement. “He’s got a huge heart for the Down Syndrome Association and Ayden. He just has grown up with him and spent so much time advocating for him,” Ronda added.For Todd and Ronda, every message and call celebrating their son’s NFL milestone is more than a moment of pride—it’s proof of the man they raised. From kicking in his backyard to breaking records on the biggest stage, Cam Little’s journey is as much about heart as it is about talent.","Cam Little smashed an NFL record by nailing a 68-yard field goal to close the first half against the Las Vegas Raiders.

She detailed her journey of shifting from supporting her partner's career to rediscovering her own dreams and defining personal success. Bündchen emphasizes her graciousness towards Brady, highlighting her focus on authenticity and fulfillment in her new chapter.

The shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Bündchen admitted that “It’s like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Bündchen met Brady at age 26, she said she was “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, she gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building.Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before: “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before. I just arrived and that was my life.” Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”She underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it: “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are.”Her message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed.Today, Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams.”While Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining what a chapter ends and a new one begins.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?","Supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady.

Travis Kelce and the iconic Luigi moment





The Kelce family’s Halloween tradition





Before Travis Kelce became one of the NFL’s most recognizable names, he was already collecting wins — even in costume contests. A recently unearthed yearbook photo from nearly two decades ago has sent fans into a nostalgic frenzy, showing a teenage Kelce winning his high school’s Halloween costume competition in 2005. Long before he was lifting Super Bowl trophies, the Kansas City Chiefs star was donning a big green hat, a fake mustache, and the unmistakable overalls of Luigi, the beloved video game plumber.The photo, rediscovered by fans, shows the 36-year-old tight end posing beside his classmate, Bianca Vann, who also took home top honors for her portrayal of civil rights icon Rosa Parks. The yearbook caption reads, “Sophomores Travis Kelce and Bianca Vann were the winners of the costume contest at the 2005 Halloween festival, Oct. 31. Kelce was dressed as Luigi, a video game plumber, while Vann dressed as Rosa Parks. The festival was put on by the REAL School and by the Class of 2008 class council.”The throwback moment isn’t entirely new to Kelce fans. During a 2023 episode of the New Heights podcast, which he co-hosts with his brother Jason Kelce, the two reminisced about their matching Super Mario Bros. costumes from their school days. Jason joked, “The only costume I can remember from school was when you were Luigi, and I was Mario.”Travis, ever the comedian, replied, “You can see how ecstatic I was to be Luigi, man,” referring to an old photo that showed him wearing the costume with a less-than-thrilled expression. Jason laughed and admitted, “I forced Travis into doing it with me. It was a good outfit.” To which Travis agreed, “It was funny.”Their mom, Donna Kelce, had also shared the memory last year in an interview with US Weekly. “It was kind of funny seeing the two of them because they were both over 6 ft. tall at that point, so that was really a humorous thing to see,” she said, adding that Jason was “kind of salty” his younger brother took home the win.Even their father, Ed Kelce, played an unforgettable part in their Halloween stories — though not as a fan of the festivities. “He’s the Grinch of Halloween,” Travis once joked. Jason added, “He would actively reject people. Like, nah, not young enough!”From those lighthearted childhood memories to championship moments on the NFL field, the rediscovered photo reminds fans that Travis Kelce’s winning charm — whether in a Luigi suit or a Chiefs uniform — has always been part of who he is.Also Read: Eagles make game-changing trade for Jaire Alexander, reshaping defense just in time for playoff push","Travis Kelce won a high school Halloween costume contest in 2005.

“Absolutely disgusting”: Brittany Mahomes’ harsh reaction to a disturbing Bills fan stunt is trending again ahead of Chiefs vs. Bills game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/absolutely-disgusting-brittany-mahomes-harsh-reaction-to-a-disturbing-bills-fan-stunt-is-trending-again-ahead-of-chiefs-vs-bills-game/articleshow/125032973.cms,"Ahead of the Chiefs-Bills game, a past incident involving Brittany Mahomes and a fan display in Buffalo has resurfaced. She publicly condemned a disrespectful Kermit the Frog puppet mocking Patrick Mahomes, urging for basic decency. This reminder of respect underscores the intense rivalry, proving that even amidst fierce competition, human dignity remains paramount.

Brittany Mahomes felt the line was crossed and she wanted the public to know it

As Patrick Mahomes returns to Buffalo, the stakes are different — but emotions are always present





For most NFL spouses, game week tends to mean travel, schedules, childcare adjustments, and a flood of national attention, but for Brittany Mahomes, there’s history attached to Buffalo. And not the fun, competitive kind. Before this weekend’s Chiefs-Bills showdown, an old incident involving a Bills supporter is circulating again online, reminding fans that not every rivalry moment lives only inside the stadium walls.Brittany, who has been in the public eye alongside Patrick Mahomes since college, once publicly reacted to a fan display that crossed a major line. Now, with yet another high-stakes meeting on the schedule, the memory of that moment is once again part of the conversation.Ahead of a previous Chiefs-Bills matchup, Brittany addressed what she considered to be one of the ugliest fan moments she had ever seen involving her family. A Kermit the Frog puppet, wearing a Patrick Mahomes No. 15 jersey, was hung publicly in Buffalo.Her reaction was immediate, emotional, and blunt. “Do we remember this, Buffalo? Absolutely disgusting,” she posted. She also followed that with a pointed reminder about basic decency in sports culture, writing, “So as you go home tonight, I pray we become better people.”Those words weren’t just about trash talk. They were about human respect and they still land heavily today.Today's meeting isn’t just another regular season date. Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen have developed the kind of on-field rivalry that dictates national windows, defines postseason eras, and fuels nonstop football debate. Kansas City enters with momentum. Buffalo enters with swagger. Both enter with pressure.And on the periphery of all that football energy sits a memory from November 2024, a moment Brittany Mahomes hasn’t forgotten, and clearly never wanted normalized. It proves one thing: rivalries can be electric. But respect still matters, especially when the entire world is watching.Also Read: “A sad, pathetic, nobody loser”: Swifties unleash fury on Kayla Nicole after Halloween stunt reignites drama with Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift","Brittany Mahomes publicly condemned a disrespectful Kermit the Frog puppet mocking Patrick Mahomes, urging for basic decency.

Taylor Swift’s reaction to Harry Styles dating one of her best friends as she plans her future with Travis Kelce is sparking major curiosity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/taylor-swifts-reaction-to-harry-styles-dating-one-of-her-best-friends-as-she-plans-her-future-with-travis-kelce-is-sparking-major-curiosity/articleshow/125032884.cms,"Taylor Swift is reportedly unfazed by her ex Harry Styles dating close friend Zoë Kravitz, showcasing a mature personal ecosystem. This calm reaction, a stark contrast to past intense media scrutiny, highlights Swift's current phase of confidence and professional success. It signifies a refreshing evolution in celebrity relationships, moving beyond drama towards forward-looking adult friendships.

Taylor Swift’s circle has redefined what post-relationship maturity looks like in 2025

Taylor Swift’s own present and her future plans with Travis Kelce are wildly different now

Taylor Swift has been the subject of relationship speculation for nearly two decades, but insiders say she’s not losing sleep over an old flame now dating one of her closest friends and that is a storyline that perfectly reflects where she is in life today. Multiple outlets, including Us Weekly, have reported that Swift has zero issue with Zoë Kravitz and Harry Styles spending time together.What’s interesting is less the headline itself, and more how this moment shows just how much Swift’s personal ecosystem has matured. Fans who lived through the Central Park paparazzi chaos of 2012 remember how intense that Taylor-Harry era was. Today, the tone is entirely different: calmer, lighter, grown and surprisingly refreshing for a superstar who once had her every breakup turned into a cultural post-mortem.A source told Us Weekly that Swift “doesn’t have an issue,” adding, “Their relationship was so long ago. Harry has moved on, and so has Taylor. They’re friendly when they see each other, which isn’t often but does happen occasionally.” In an industry that often thrives on recycled drama, this is a direct signal of emotional evolution, not just for Swift, but for her entire circle.Harry himself once acknowledged the creative impact of their brief romance.In a 2017 Rolling Stone interview, he said, “I write from my experiences; everyone does that. I’m lucky if everything [we went through] helped create those songs,” even calling Swift’s music “great” and noting her songs were “everywhere.”Swift is engaged, thriving professionally, and operating in a phase of life grounded in confidence rather than reactive defensiveness. Kravitz, meanwhile, is famously self-directed; she's never chased tabloid chaos.So instead of tension, this moment is a glimpse of what adult celebrity friendship looks like, not petty, not nostalgic, not territorial, just forward-moving. It’s almost an anti-tabloid headline. And that alone makes it notable.Also Read: “Those songs hit her hard”: Blake Lively reportedly crushed after hearing Taylor Swift’s new songs as Travis Kelce helps fuel album buzz","Taylor Swift is reportedly unfazed by her ex Harry Styles dating close friend Zoë Kravitz.

Shaquille O’Neal shares how martial arts and respect helped him grow lasting ties in China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/shaquille-oneal-shares-how-martial-arts-and-respect-helped-him-grow-lasting-ties-in-china/articleshow/125045568.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Shaquille O’Neal’s childhood obsession with martial arts built his champion mindset

Shaquille O’Neal proves loyalty pays off as China embraces his sincerity over fame

Shaquille O’Neal’s journey in China isn’t just about his fame; it’s rooted in the values he picked up long before he donned an NBA jersey. As a kid in Newark, he learned not from coaches but from martial arts films that emphasized discipline, humility, and perseverance. Those cinematic heroes influenced his perspective: stumble, push through, and gain respect. Fast forward to today, and that same philosophy guides his experiences in China, where real human connections matter more than business deals.For O’Neal, success is less about statistics than it is about fealty, faith and friendship that transcend business transactions. His bond with Yao Ming and the esteem he’s earned with Chinese fans are proof positive that Shaq’s influence is about substance as much as it is about stature. He built his empire by leading with heart instead of ego.O'Neal's connection to China started in his youth in Newark, New Jersey, where the lack of opportunities molded his ambitions. ""Growing up where I grew up, I never thought I would even leave the state,"" he told SCMP reporters in the St. Regis suite, his 7-foot-1 frame accentuated by a dark suit and signature sunglasses. ""I always had the dream, but I think what made me who I am is definitely watching Chinese culture.""The core of this influence came from the martial arts movies O’Neal consumed during his childhood, timeless films showcasing underdog heroes like those in Bruce Lee's works or narratives akin to The Karate Kid. He described the common theme in detail, ""Stories where the student is defeated by the master, returns again and again to train, and eventually rises to surpass them.""To SCMP, O’Neal declared, ""That’s been the philosophy of my life."" His attitude of never-ending practice and ultimate success reflected his journey from a challenging childhood to becoming an NBA star, where he was picked first overall by the Orlando Magic in 1992 after playing at Louisiana State University (LSU).In China, this philosophy really struck a chord, allowing O’Neal to establish himself not only as a famous athlete but also as someone fans could relate to.His initial trips to the country twenty years ago, when the NBA was just starting to grow, gave him the chance to bond with fans who loved his larger-than-life image.""I’ve had a lot of love for Chinese culture,"" he reflected to the SCMP team.""Back in the day, no one understood Shaq as a brand but I came over, and it was just like a warm welcome."" He set himself apart from his Western counterparts by embodying the martial arts principles of humility and persistence, which earned him a reputation as someone who valued and learned from Chinese traditions.Another aspect of O’Neal’s martial arts-inspired grit is his steadfast commitment to loyalty, a quality he attributes to being recognized as a ""trusted name"" in China. ""It’s not about business,"" he insisted to SCMP in the Macau suite. ""It’s about building relationships."" This method has been crucial for understanding cultural subtleties and building real relationships, particularly in a market where personal trust usually outweighs transactions.A key story highlights this: At the start of Yao Ming's NBA journey, O’Neal engaged in some trash talk with the towering 7-foot-6 Chinese player, which was a typical rivalry move on the court. However, everything changed when O’Neal's dad, who was in charge of his fan club, stepped in. He slammed a pile of fan letters from Yao onto O’Neal's desk and scolded him, as O’Neal recounted to SCMP, ""Mr. Yao only means respect."" O’Neal found out later that Yao had looked up to him as an ""outsider"" making his way into the league. ""I didn’t know that Yao, as an outsider, had looked up to me,"" O’Neal admitted. ""So I learned, and after that, we became friends.""This whole ""master and student"" turnaround—kind of like those martial arts movie plots—has created a brotherhood that still stands strong today. During the 2025 NBA China Games, the two had a touching moment at center court, which got the Macau crowd cheering and represented their reconciliation.Yao, the hometown hero of China and a former player for the Shanghai Sharks, symbolizes the loyalty that O’Neal embraced. Their friendship has led to them making joint appearances, with O’Neal frequently highlighting how Yao has helped globalize the NBA.O’Neal takes this loyalty principle seriously. ""Integrity and trust are important to O’Neal,"" he stated to SCMP. ""Every company I’m with, I have to like the product. I get a lot of opportunities to do business, but if I don’t like your product, I can’t take your money and sell something I don’t like to the people."" In China, this genuine vibe has boosted his charm, transforming casual fans into loyal supporters.Shaquille O’Neal didn’t win China over with size or celebrity, he did it with sincerity. His story is a reminder that real power doesn’t come from being the loudest in the room but from being the most genuine one in it. He treats loyalty like currency, and that’s why China doesn’t just admire him, they trust him.Also Read: NBA Cup 2025 prize money breakdown: How much are players really competing for in this season’s cash-fueled tournament?","O'Neal's connection to China started in his youth in Newark, New Jersey, where the lack of opportunities molded his ambitions.

What's in Store for the Los Angeles Lakers

The’ journey through the 2025-26 NBA season has taken an unexpected turn as the franchise weighs the. Once seen as a reliable rotation piece, Vincent’s time in Los Angeles has been plagued by recurring injuries and inconsistent performances, leaving the Lakers front office to consider moving him before the February 5 trade deadline.After another injury setback this season, internal discussions have reportedly intensified around finding a trade partner for the $33 million veteran. While the Lakers are still in the early stages of the campaign, their ambitions for a deep playoff run have added urgency to fix lingering roster concerns.Following last season’s early playoff exit, the Los Angeles Lakers entered the new campaign determined to reestablish themselves as championship contenders. The roster, considered one of the strongest in the league, blends star power and experience with the leadership of LeBron James and the dynamic playmaking of Luka Dončić.Dončić, still just 26 years old, has become the face of the Lakers’ future. Despite his youth, he’s made it clear to team executives that patience isn’t an option. He’s committed to a win-now approach, emphasizing urgency and competitiveness as key values in the team’s pursuit of another NBA title.Even though LeBron James has yet to make his season debut, his focus remains unchanged - adding another championship to his legendary career. His representatives have reiterated that while James understands the team’s long-term vision, he remains fully committed to competing at the highest level. The veteran forward’s unwavering dedication continues to set the tone for the Los Angeles Lakers’ locker room, reinforcing the championship-or-bust mentality that defines the franchise.Unfortunately, Gabe Vincent’s tenure in Los Angeles has failed to meet expectations. The 28-year-old guard has appeared in just 86 of a possible 170 games since joining the team, often sidelined by injuries. His inability to stay healthy or deliver consistent production has made him one of the most scrutinized players on the roster.Gabe Vincent was initially signed to provide veteran depth and defensive reliability after an impressive run with the Miami Heat. However, his struggles have forced the Los Angeles Lakers to reconsider his fit, particularly as emerging talent Dalton Knecht begins to shine in his rookie season. Knecht’s recent surge in confidence and offensive impact has further reduced Vincent’s opportunities in the rotation.The Lakers now face the challenge of balancing short-term competitiveness with long-term planning. With Dončić entering his prime and LeBron still chasing another championship, Los Angeles cannot afford to keep underperforming contracts on the books.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Boston Celtics eye $15 million ex-Charlotte Hornets star to bolster frontcourt after major offseason trades Unless Gabe Vincent can regain his health and form soon, the likelihood of a midseason trade appears high.

The Indiana Pacers defeated the Golden State Warriors 114-109 on Saturday night, with Quenton Jackson stealing the show. After the Pacers defeated the Warriors 114-109 at home yesterday night, head coach Rick Carlisle praised two-way guard Quenton Jackson.Quenton Jackson spent most of the 2023–24 season with the Windy City Bulls, but he spent the final few games with the Indiana Mad Ants. Jackson averaged 17.2 points, 4.0 rebounds, 5.7 assists, 1.8 steals, and 0.3 blocks per game over 38 games with the Windy City Bulls and 9 games with the Mad Ants beginning in March 2024.Before their win over the Warriors , the Pacers were 0-5, and it appeared like this season would be a total loss. After missing the Pacers' opening two games of the season, Jackson has gradually made his way into head coach Rick Carlisle's rotation.During Saturday's victory over the Warriors, Jackson recorded 25 points, six rebounds, 10 assists, and three steals in 31 minutes. Carlisle decided to start him against the Hawks on Friday night after he demonstrated enough in his ten minutes against the Timberwolves and eighteen minutes against the Mavericks.Talking about Jackson, Rick Carlisle said:“He’s an attacker, and he’s gotta be in attack mode. He’s a hybrid guard, really. He plays point. He plays two. But it’s important that he is who he is in his soul, and that is an attacker. And so, he attacked tonight. He had a tough job chasing [Steph] Curry around all night. We matched their minutes pretty much…”He further said:“We actually had to go back with Q before Curry came back in, because RayJ [Dennis] got a little tired and it was just time to get him back in.And then, I think it was two threes and then the bank shot that sealed the game. It had to be a great feeling for him.”Although Quenton Jackson's actual net worth has not been made public, his career earnings through the 2024–2025 season are estimated to be at $933,327. In addition to his potential salary of $636,434 for the 2025–2026 season, Jackson's NBA and G League salaries contribute to his net worth.Additionally, he also has signed six contracts totaling $5,634,177. At age 27, he will become a UFA at the end of the 2025–2026 season.The 27-year-old scored 15 points after making four of his eight field goals, including two of his four three-pointers. After that, Jackson played 31 minutes against the Warriors, scoring 25 points, grabbing six rebounds, and dishing out 10 assists to earn Carlisle's trust.In contrast, Jackson's field goal efficiency (62.5%) was far higher than Stephen Curry 's (34.8%), who scored 24 points and provided two assists for the Warriors. Jackson scored a season-high number of points, rebounds, assists, and steals in his second consecutive start.Along the way to his first double-double of the 2025–26 season, he led his team in assists and made effective shots. Jackson will now need to maintain his strong play in order to assist the Pacers in moving up the Eastern Conference standings.Also read: Is Jonathan Kuminga playing tonight?

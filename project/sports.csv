How and why Rishabh Pant's England tour could come to an abrupt end due to toe fracture

NEW DELHI: England asserted their dominance on Day 2 of the fourth Test against India at Old Trafford, Manchester, ending Thursday’s play at 225/2. A commanding 166-run opening stand between Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley laid the foundation, helping England close in on India’s first innings total of 358. The deficit now stands at just 133 runs, despite Rishabh Pant ’s earlier half-century.Duckett and Crawley resumed the final session at 77 without loss and continued to pile on the runs. Duckett reached his fifty with a boundary off Shardul Thakur, which also took England past the 100-run mark.Crawley wasn’t far behind, bringing up his own half-century by driving Thakur to the boundary in the 21st over. England crossed 150 in the 29th over, courtesy of another Duckett boundary—this time off Mohammed Siraj.Former England skipper Nasser Hussain didn’t hold back in his criticism of India’s bowling and captaincy. ""Slightly changing conditions, but they bowled very poorly. A change in overhead conditions doesn't make you bowl both sides of the wicket. Too many balls on the pads. Captain's decisions... didn't quite agree with, to be honest. Kamboj wasn't in the squad a week ago, to bring him into the team and give him a new ball ahead of Siraj... seems odd,"" Hussain said on Sky Sports.He continued: ""I would've gone for Siraj for a short burst, then switched him to the other end to follow Bumrah. We've all been talking about the green channel on the strip across... this is the end where Stokes bowled and got his fifer, and got uneven bounce and sideways movement. Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong.""The former captain added: ""Rishabh Pant went out there on one leg, and got valuable runs today. They've just handed those runs back to England.""The breakthrough finally came in the 32nd over when Ravindra Jadeja dismissed Crawley for 84 off 113 balls, breaking the opening stand at 166.England lost their second wicket at 197, with debutant Anshul Kamboj claiming his first Test scalp by removing Duckett for 94 from 100 deliveries.England crossed 200 in the 39th over, with Ollie Pope finding the boundary off Kamboj.At stumps, Pope and Joe Root had added an unbeaten 28-run partnership.For India, Kamboj returned figures of 1/48 from 10 overs, while Jadeja ended the day with 1/37 in 8 overs.",England end Day 2 of the fourth Test against India at Old Trafford at 225/2.

Poll Do you agree with Ricky Ponting's assessment of India's tactics on Day 2? Yes, I agree No, I disagree

NEW DELHI: Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting didn’t hold back in his assessment of India’s tactics on Day 2 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, calling Shubman Gill ’s side “tactically off” after England’s openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett dominated with a 166-run stand.Speaking to Sky Sports, Ponting criticised India’s field placements and bowling choices, especially during the opening hour when debutant Anshul Kamboj shared the new ball with Jasprit Bumrah.“They got scored off on both sides of the wicket, didn’t they?” Ponting said bluntly. “I think they were tactically off as well. I don’t think Kamboj should have taken the new ball. I didn’t like that from the start.”Duckett took full advantage, smashing five of his first six boundaries on the leg-side behind square.“They were tactically wrong there,” Ponting continued. “Even watching now, Bumrah is bowling from the wrong end. Most of the wickets have fallen from the Statham End, and he’s done most of his work from the Anderson End. They were off execution-wise and tactically they’ve been off as well.”England ended Day 2 on 225/2 in reply to India’s 358, trailing by 133 runs. Duckett (94) and Crawley (84) both fell short of centuries, but their aggressive start ensured England held the momentum heading into Day 3.Kamboj, playing only due to injuries to India’s pace unit, picked up his maiden Test wicket when Duckett edged him to Dhruv Jurel.With the series at 2-1 in England’s favour, a win in Manchester would seal the series for Ben Stokes’ side. But Ponting’s pointed remarks suggest India’s strategy may need a serious rethink if they are to take this five-Test contest to a decider at The Oval.",Ricky Ponting criticises India's tactics on Day 2 of fourth Test at Old Trafford.

Poll What do you think of Rishabh Pant's performance despite his injury? Incredible display of courage Just a good innings Should have rested

NEW DELHI: In a stirring display of courage and class, Rishabh Pant once again proved why he is India’s heartbeat in Test cricket, battling through a toe injury to script a fighting fifty on Day 2 of the fourth Test against England at Old Trafford. The left-hander walked out to bat with a visible limp after Shardul Thakur’s dismissal, triggering a standing ovation from the Manchester crowd — and admiration from cricketing legends worldwide.Pant, undeterred by pain, struck 54 off 75 balls, peppered with three boundaries and two sixes, matching Virender Sehwag’s all-time Indian record of 90 sixes in Test cricket. His brave effort, however, was more than just numbers.India’s cricketing icon Sachin Tendulkar led the chorus of praise, posting on X: “Resilience is about playing through pain and rising above it. @RishabhPant17 showed tremendous character by walking back into the game with an injury and delivering a performance like that. His fifty is a powerful reminder of the grit and determination it takes to represent your country.”Former all-rounder Yuvraj Singh echoed the sentiment on Instagram, writing: “True spirit shows up when the spirit is indomitable! Injury can shake the body but not the mind, good stuff @rishabhpant.”Veteran pacer Ishant Sharma also lauded Pant’s grit in an interview with ANI: “This shows how mentally strong he is. If someone does not give up in life, then they can make a comeback in life.”Pant’s knock was not only inspirational but historic. He overtook Rohit Sharma to become India’s leading run-scorer in the World Test Championship era, now sitting on 2731 runs in 38 Tests. The fifty in Manchester also pushed him past MS Dhoni in 50+ scores for Indian wicketkeepers — Pant now has 14, compared to Dhoni’s 13.In pain, but never in doubt, Pant’s innings was a celebration of resilience, a moment that left fans and legends alike in awe — and one that will be etched in the folklore of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.","Rishabh Pant hits 54 off 75 balls, peppered with three boundaries and two sixes.

NEW DELHI: Former India head coach and World Cup-winning all-rounder Ravi Shastri has lifted the lid on the staggering sums earned by India's cricketing superstars, whose status and popularity are similar to global icons like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo Speaking on the ‘Stick to Cricket' podcast with Michael Vaughan , Shastri didn't hold back when asked how much Indian cricketers make off the field.""They earn a lot. They earn a lot through endorsements, for sure,"" Shastri said, adding, ""Upwards of Rs 100 crores. Which would say 10 million pounds.""The revelation left the panel in awe, as Shastri broke down the math: ""I would say… you just calculate 100 rupees is a pound. So you work backwards and you calculate upwards of that because someone like MS Dhoni or a Virat Kohli or a Sachin Tendulkar at his pomp, they would do over 15, 20 ads.""He further elaborated on how top Indian players manage their packed schedules: ""It's per day. There's no time. They could easily do more because of the amount of cricket being played. So, you know, they'll do an ad for a year and give a day — just one day to shoot.That's all you'll get. And then you play it out as many times as you want.""Shastri's comments reflect cricket's unmatched cultural impact in India — comparable to football's status in Brazil or Argentina. Players like Dhoni, Kohli, and Tendulkar enjoy not only nationwide adoration but also global commercial appeal, with brand deals and social media fanbases rivaling those of Messi or Ronaldo.","Ravi Shastri reveals how much Indian cricketers make off the field.

Why Shubman Gill, Jasprit Bumrah lost their cool in last five minutes of Day 3 vs England

England opener Zak Crawley has shed light on the fiery confrontation with India captain Shubman Gill during the tense third day of the Lord’s Test, calling it one of the most exhilarating moments of the series so far.The drama unfolded late on Day 3, when Crawley and fellow opener Ben Duckett took 90 seconds longer than usual to walk out to bat. The delay drew immediate protest from Gill, who accused the duo of deliberately wasting time to face fewer deliveries before stumps. What followed was a heated exchange, with nearly the entire Indian team surrounding the batters in an intense verbal standoff.Recalling the moment, Crawley said at the post-day press conference of the Manchester Test on Thursday: ""I've always enjoyed that part of cricket, to be honest, especially when you're batting. There's two of you against eleven, and they're desperate to get you out, and they're chirping you... I loved that little eight-minute passage.""He emphasised that the confrontation didn’t cross any lines: ""No one stepped over the line.I thought everyone was in good spirits. It was just competitive cricket, and I really enjoyed it.""The altercation fired up both teams. Mohammed Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah came out steaming the next day, and by Day 5, England’s response was equally fierce. Ben Stokes delivered a relentless 10-over spell, and Jofra Archer unleashed raw pace to help bowl India out for 170, sealing a dramatic 22-run win.Addressing the delay, Crawley clarified: ""No, no. Not at all. I sit in my spot until the umpires go out. I wasn’t aware we were 90 seconds late, but fair enough.""",England's Zak Crawley and India's Shubman Gill were involved in a heated exchange at Lord's.

Poll Do you think Rishabh Pant should have played despite his fractured toe? Yes, it shows courage No, health comes first

TimesofIndia.com in Manchester: On a day dominated for long stretches by England’s opening pair, it was the courageous return of Rishabh Pant that truly defined the narrative of Day 2 in the fourth Test at Old Trafford. Battling a fractured toe sustained on Day 1, Pant walked in after the fall of Shardul Thakur to a rousing ovation from the Manchester crowd. Clearly in pain, the wicketkeeper-batter stood tall to score a gutsy 54 off 75 balls, helping India stretch their total to 358.“It was always our plan… (for Rishabh Pant to bat). The medical team did a great job but he was still in a lot of pain,” Shardul Thakur told reporters in the press conference after the day’s play on Thursday.Pant’s knock was a symbol of defiance after India had earlier lost Ravindra Jadeja in the early stages of Day 2. Thakur (41) and Washington Sundar (27) stitched a useful stand before England, led by Ben Stokes’ 5/72, wrapped up the innings post-lunch.Thakur, who bowled just five overs for 35 runs, pointed out that bowling decisions rested with the captain. “Giving bowling is the captain’s call. Not in my hands. The captain decides when to give them.I could have bowled two overs more today but that is the captain’s call. It is difficult to find rhythm but I try and use my experience.” His blunt response on the same reflected the trust in the skipper and the calls he made during the 4th Test, up until the end of day's play on Thursday.On Pant’s fitness, Thakur added: “It will be his call. He didn’t come in the bus today because he was in the hospital. He wasn’t at the ground when we were warming up. It is a fracture — the news is already out.”England’s reply began on a dominant note, with openers Zak Crawley (84) and Ben Duckett (94) racing to a 166-run stand in just 32.4 overs. India finally broke through when Jadeja had Crawley caught behind, and Anshul Kamboj dismissed Duckett to deny him a century, which was also the 24-year-old’s maiden Test wicket.“Whatever runs we got on the board was a good effort, ball was doing a lot,” Thakur said, defending the team’s total. However, he admitted the bowlers could have done better. “We could have been better with the new ball. Runs just kept flowing. It wasn’t difficult for bowlers… we could have been patient. We have to evaluate which deliveries to stick by.”England ended the day at 225 for two, trailing India by 133 runs, with Ollie Pope (20) and Joe Root (11) unbeaten. However, it was Pant’s fighting spirit that set the tone, giving India hope heading into Day 3 of this crucial encounter.","Rishabh Pant played despite fractured toe sustained on Day 1.

How and why Rishabh Pant's England tour could come to an abrupt end due to toe fracture

England established control on Day 2 of the fourth Test against India at Manchester, reaching 225 for two at stumps on Thursday, powered by Ben Duckett 's aggressive 94 and Zak Crawley 's 84. Earlier, India posted 358 in their first innings, highlighted by an inspiring 54 from Rishabh Pant, who batted with a broken foot Duckett and Crawley put on a commanding 166-run opening partnership off 192 balls, effectively neutralising India's bowling attack. The duo scored at nearly five runs per over, taking advantage of wayward bowling from the Indian pacers.India's pace trio of Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, and debutant Anshul Kamboj struggled to maintain accuracy, frequently offering loose deliveries on the leg side. The England openers capitalised on these opportunities, particularly Duckett, who scored freely.Kamboj, who joined the squad as a late replacement due to injuries, managed to claim his first Test wicket by dismissing Duckett. The length delivery that got extra bounce resulted in a catch behind the wickets.Shardul Thakur's expensive bowling spell added to India's difficulties, with England's batters facing more favourable batting conditions under sunshine compared to India's innings under overcast skies.In the earlier part of the day, Ben Stokes claimed his first five-wicket haul in eight years as England bowled out India for 358. The morning session saw India resume at 264 for four, with conditions favouring the seamers.Jofra Archer struck early, removing the in-form Ravindra Jadeja for 20. The delivery shaped away from leg stump, taking the outside edge with Harry Brook completing a low catch at second slip.Shardul Thakur showed attacking intent during his 41-run innings, including impressive boundaries off Chris Woakes and Ben Stokes. However, Stokes eventually dismissed him with a clever delivery that induced a catch to Ben Duckett at gully.The most remarkable moment of the day came when Rishabh Pant walked out to bat with a broken foot. Despite his visible struggle to run between wickets, Pant displayed exceptional courage and skill.Pant's innings included a spectacular six off Archer's slower ball between mid-wicket and square leg. He followed this with a boundary through cover off Stokes to reach his fifty, earning a standing ovation from the crowd.Archer eventually ended Pant's brave innings by cleaning up his stumps with an excellent delivery. Joe Root's gesture of patting Pant on his way back reflected the opposition's appreciation for his valiant effort.","England reached 225 for two at stumps on Day 2 of the fourth Test.

Poll Which candidate do you believe has the best chance of improving Indian football? Khalid Jamil Stephen Constantine Stefan Tarkovic

PANAJI: The technical committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has recommended Khalid Jamil as its top choice to fill the national coach vacancy, following the resignation of Manolo Marquez.Should Jamil get the nod from the AIFF’s executive committee, he will become the first Indian as full-time coach since Sukhvinder Singh in 2005. Two other Indians – Armando Colaco and Savio Medeira –held interim charges, following the sacking of Bob Houghton in 2011.“We had lot of applications, and after careful scrutiny, the technical committee has recommended three names to the executive committee,” AIFF’s national team director Subrata Paul told TOI after the technical committee meeting on Wednesday. “We believe in the potential of these three coaches. They can take our national team forward.”Stephen Constantine, hoping for a third stint with the national team after winning four trophies in the past, is the second name on the list, while former Slovakia and Kyrgyzstan coach Stefan Tarkovic has also been shortlisted.“All coaches have their own strong points. Khalid has done extremely well in the I-League and Indian Super League (ISL).Constantine knows Indian football inside out and India played well at the Asian Cup in 2019. Tarkovic has a good national team experience, after stints with Slovakia and Kyrgyzstan,” said another official.The technical committee has backed Jamil for the top job, given his record in domestic football. Despite limited resources, the former India midfielder won the I-League with Aizawl FC, scripting one of Indian football’s most remarkable stories in 2017. He then caught everyone’s attention with semifinal spots in the ISL with NorthEast and Jamshedpur FC, a side he continues to coach.“The AIFF will now speak with the coaches and look at their (salary) demands. If Khalid agrees to the terms, he will get the India job,” said another official.Besides the technical committee, Khalid has also got the backing of Dronacharya Award winners, Armando Colaco and Bimal Ghosh, both of whom were consulted as advisors to AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey.According to sources, Constantine too has support within the committee, chaired by former India captain IM Vijayan. India went from 173 to 97 in FIFA rankings between 2015 and 2018 when Constantine was at the helm of affairs. The English coach, who last managed Pakistan, won four trophies with the national team: LG Cup (2002), SAFF Cup (2015), Tri Nation Series (2017) and Inter-Continental Cup (2018).From the 170 who applied for the national team job, the list was pruned to 20 and presented before the technical committee which met virtually on Wed.

Poll Will Marcus Rashford thrive at Barcelona? Yes, he will regain his form No, he will struggle

Marcus Rashford has been handed a fresh opportunity to revive his career, joining Barcelona on a season-long loan from Manchester United, the Spanish club confirmed on Wednesday.Once considered one of Europe’s most promising forwards, Rashford has seen his form dip in recent seasons. After falling out of favour at United, the 27-year-old spent the latter half of last season on loan at Aston Villa.At Barcelona, Rashford will be part of a forward line that already includes Lamine Yamal, Brazil’s Raphinha, and veteran striker Robert Lewandowski.Rashford arrived in Barcelona on Sunday to complete the deal. He met his new teammates and reportedly trained with the squad on Tuesday. Financial details of the agreement have not been disclosed, but Spanish media reports suggest the loan includes an option for Barcelona to buy the England international for around €30 million ($35 million).Barcelona had initially targeted Spain forward Nico Williams during the transfer window, but the Athletic Bilbao star signed a long-term extension, opening the door for Rashford’s move.Despite having the most prolific attack in Spain last season, Barcelona were keen to strengthen their frontline. The trio of Yamal, Raphinha, and Lewandowski combined to score 102 goals in the league — 24 more than Real Madrid's tally. They also led the Champions League scoring charts with 43 goals before being eliminated in the semifinals by Inter Milan.Rashford, a product of Manchester United’s academy, made 429 appearances and scored 138 goals, winning five major trophies with the club. However, he only reached the 20-goal mark in three seasons and scored a combined 15 goals in his last two at United. While at Villa, he added another four in 17 games.Despite his recent struggles, Rashford’s talent has rarely been doubted. He recently returned to the England squad under new coach Thomas Tuchel, keeping his hopes alive for a place at next year’s World Cup.","Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan from Manchester United.

Poll Do you agree with Crystal Palace's exclusion from the Europa League? Yes, they deserve to be excluded. No, they should be reinstated.

Crystal Palace supporters have staged a bold protest outside UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, over the club’s controversial exclusion from the Europa League.Despite earning a spot in the competition by winning the FA Cup last season, Palace were ruled out by UEFA for allegedly breaching regulations related to multi-club ownership. The decision is being contested by the club at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), with a verdict expected on August 11.If the ruling stands, Nottingham Forest are expected to take Palace’s Europa League spot, with the Eagles moving down to the Europa Conference League.Refusing to stay silent, Palace fans, and the Holmesdale Fanatics in particular, carried out a symbolic protest by delivering a suitcase filled with fake money to UEFA’s lakeside offices. The gesture was meant to highlight what they see as UEFA’s preference for financial interests over fairness.Alongside the suitcase, a letter addressed to UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin was hand-delivered. It demanded the governing body reverse its decision and reinstate Palace in the Europa League.A post from the Holmesdale Fanatics on X reflected the supporters' sentiment and urgency in the appeal to reinstate the club.Part of it read, ""Following this, we then travelled to the CAS headquarters in Lausanne to remind their organisation that this ruling can and should be overturned. The protests against those responsible will continue. REINSTATE PALACE NOW.""The issue stems from American businessman John Textor holding ownership stakes in both Crystal Palace and French club Lyon, which is a situation that UEFA rules prohibit if both clubs qualify for the same competition.The fans' protest reflects growing frustration over what they see as an unfair punishment, and their message is clear: they believe Crystal Palace deserve their place in the Europa League.","Crystal Palace were excluded from the Europa League by UEFA.

Arsenal have completed a historic £1 million transfer of Canadian forward Olivia Smith from Liverpool, marking the first seven-figure transfer in women's football. The 20-year-old's move to the European champions surpasses the previous record of £900,000 paid by Chelsea for American defender Naomi Girma from San Diego Wave in January.The milestone transfer comes 44 years after Trevor Francis became the first male player to command a million-pound fee when he moved from Birmingham City to Nottingham Forest in 1979.

Her versatility allows her to play both as a forward and on the wing, making her an attractive signing for Arsenal.Arsenal's director of women's football, Clare Wheatley, expressed enthusiasm about the signing: ""We're thrilled to bring Olivia to Arsenal. She's one of the most talented young players in the game and has huge potential for further development here.""Smith's journey in football began with her becoming the youngest player to represent Canada at age 15. She then moved to Sporting Lisbon in 2023, where she scored 16 goals in 28 games before joining Liverpool.""It's a privilege and an honor to sign for Arsenal. The atmosphere the supporters create at Emirates Stadium is incredible and I can't wait to have that behind me now,"" Smith stated.The transfer represents Arsenal's ambition to strengthen their position in women's football, following their Champions League victory. The club, which holds the distinction of being the most decorated in English women's football, has also secured the services of winger Chloe Kelly, Taylor Hinds, and Anneke Borbe on free transfers for the upcoming season.Liverpool, who finished seventh last season, plan to use the transfer fee to reinforce their squad. The record-breaking transfer signifies Arsenal's intent to maintain their dominance in the league while setting a new benchmark for women's football transfers.The transfer marks a significant moment in the development of women's football, establishing a new financial milestone that reflects the growing investment and commercial value in the women's game.

But all that is in the past now, with his triumph this season at Nissan.In an interview with FormulaE.com, he said, “Part of me realizes what we’ve achieved, and I’m trying to digest it in a positive way and balance my emotions. From a mental health perspective, I feel a lot lighter, like a weight has come off my shoulders. It’s not something we drivers talk about very often, but the last few days have been a huge release of emotion and energy. It feels great. Even now, when I watch the videos back, I struggle to believe it’s actually done!”Oliver Rowland has also made it clear that he has no plans to switch teams or retire after his championship win.“The way I see my career ending is in Formula E — hopefully not too soon. I want to grow with the championship and see it in an even better place when I eventually leave. Our goal is for the series to keep evolving, with faster cars and the most advanced technology. I’m very happy with where I am right now and incredibly proud of the team and what we’ve accomplished so far.

Talking to FormulaE.com after finally clinching his second win in Berlin, he said, ""It's been a really tough few months, and it felt like I couldn't do anything right.I kept having problems; performance wasn't quite there, and qualifying was just too rapid, so I had to keep it together. Obviously, in the race, it was changeable conditions. I think the team really managed the strategy well. I had some problems after the pit stop, which allowed Pascal (Wehrlein) to get closer to me.”""So once it happened, I thought I might have to stop in the race, and I was just kind of like, well, that just sums up my season. Luckily, I was able to juggle both things and bring them home, but it just wasn't expected. I'm just very happy for my side of the garage, for the team — you know, it's been a good day for what's been a really difficult season,"" he added.Also Read: Berlin E-Prix 2025 Results: Mitch Evans clinches second win of season, Pascal Wehrlein closes points gap with Oliver Rowland After regaining his confidence, Mitch Evans will now be competing in London, where he is tied for the most number of podiums — five in total.

Other Formula E initiatives

Formula E has several initiatives running under its sustainability campaign. Among them is a youth education program called Driving Force, supported by PIF E360. It aims to teach children between the ages of 8 and 18 about science, technology, and sustainability. The goal is to reach over 50,000 students worldwide by the end of 2025.The Driving Force initiative comes at a time when there is expected to be a massive demand for 200,000 skilled workers in the UK for green jobs by 2030, according to PwC.Driving Force helps students learn about clean energy and the environment. It also introduces them to role models from the fields of science and technology, helping them gain the knowledge and confidence needed to consider careers in these areas. These workshops use fun and practical activities to show how what students learn in school can lead to exciting real-world careers in racing, clean energy, engineering, and more.On July 16, over 90 students participated in Formula E’s Driving Force workshop at Hammersmith Academy in London. The session was one of five workshops held at schools across London in July, near the London E-Prix race site in East London and Formula E’s headquarters in Hammersmith.Earlier this year, similar workshops were also held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and Miami, USA, during Formula E race weeks.Julia Pallé, VP of Sustainability at Formula E, said, ""A survey in 2024 of more than 7,000 UK secondary school students reveals a worrying downward trend in both their involvement in and their ambition to pursue STEM subjects — a stark wake-up call for educators and policymakers alike.""""Teachers are being asked to make stronger connections between subjects and careers, but they need support from employers to do that effectively. Driving Force, presented by PIF E360, is part of the solution to help the education system deliver what our students and our green economy both desperately need to succeed,” she added.Also Read: Taylor Barnard overtakes Antonio Felix Da Costa in Berlin to claim 3rd in Formula E Driver Standings Formula E’s broader social impact strategy includes several other initiatives such as FIA Girls on Track, the Better Futures Fund, and Inspiration Hour.

Seems like I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time too often. 3 wins lost in the last laps because of safety cars, a few mistakes my mixture, the season could have been so different, but that's what it is in sport, and the bad moments, if used well, are the best thing we have. What now ? Now off to London for the week to fight for the team and builders championship and finish this season with a bang, because you never give up, ever.Thank you all, we are amazing.

Oliver Rowland’s journey in Formula E was full of ups and downs

Oliver Rowland shares his happiness on Formula E championship win

Things weren’t always well-planned for Oliver Rowland, who has just clinched the Formula E World Championship. The 32-year-old Nissan driver took major risks throughout his career, including walking away from a team without another offer in hand. He describes that time as one of the toughest periods of his life. But Rowland eventually bounced back, joining a new team and going on to win the championship this season.Oliver Rowland made his one-race debut in Formula E with Mahindra Racing at the 2015 Punta del Este ePrix, replacing the injured Nick Heidfeld. He quickly disappeared from the scene afterward.Reflecting on that strange start in Formula E’s second season, Rowland told Formula E’s official website, “If you go back to Punta del Este, I remember having no idea about anything when I arrived and leaving thinking, ‘I'm not sure I want to do that again, because it was pretty tough.’”He eventually returned as a full-time Formula E driver with Nissan e.dams in 2018. After delivering notable performances over a few seasons, he switched to Mahindra Racing in 2021. However, midway through the 2023 season, Rowland made another bold move — quitting the team without a confirmed offer elsewhere. Nissan brought him back the following season, leading to two remarkable years that culminated in him winning the Season 11 championship.Speaking about his decision to leave Mahindra Racing in 2023 after two seasons, Rowland said, “I took a huge risk for my career and for my family because my contract is what keeps us all fed and watered, so walking away from that was a really, really tough period in my life. I remember not sleeping for like, two, three weeks at some point. To kind of write the story and come out on the other side with the team that I started in Formula E with is just perfect. ”He added, “As a racing driver, a lot of days are bad, and you have to keep believing in yourself — that you're capable of doing it. Going into this year, I was confident that we would have a good chance.”Now, Oliver Rowland has become the Formula E World Champion in just his second year back with Nissan. “The moment I arrived in the championship and looked at the caliber of drivers here and the previous World Champions, it's such a good achievement for me to become World Champion. To be part of that is incredible,” he said.Also Read: Oliver Rowland’s rise to champion: Rare childhood moments highlighted in touching video Rowland will now race in front of his home crowd in London, where he’ll lift the World Championship trophy.

Taylor Barnard takes the number 3 spot in Formula E Driver Standings

How Taylor Barnard surpassed Antonio Felix Da Costa in Driver Standings

This is 21-year-old Taylor Barnard’s first full-fledged season as a rookie driver, and the NEOM McLaren racer has achieved what many of his peers couldn’t. At the recently held Berlin E-Prix, Barnard put up a strong performance on the track, managing to surpass Antonio Felix Da Costa and take the third spot in the standings. With two races remaining, Barnard still has a chance to overtake Pascal Wehrlein for the second place.Taylor Barnard outperformed TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix Da Costa in Berlin. Da Costa, who had been comfortably sitting in third, has now slipped to fourth in the standings.Taking to Instagram to reflect on his Berlin performance, Barnard wrote, “Reflecting on Berlin. Definitely a weekend of what could have been, but we scored good points across both races, closing the gap to P2 in the standings. An unfortunately timed SC on Sunday cost us the chance of going for the win, but we will maximise our efforts to go into London as strong as possible.Taylor Barnard finished fourth in Round 13 and sixth in Round 14 race at the Berlin E-Prix, collecting a total of 20 points. In comparison, Da Costa finished 10th and 8th in the two races, scoring just 5 points — enabling Barnard to leap ahead of him in the standings.Currently, Oliver Rowland has sealed the Formula E Championship title with 184 points.Pascal Wehrlein holds second place with 125 points, while Barnard trails closely behind with 112. A strong performance in London could be enough for Barnard to overtake Wehrlein and claim second place in the championship.So far this season, Barnard has secured five podium finishes — one each in Sao Paulo, Tokyo, and Shanghai, and two in Jeddah — though he is yet to clinch his first Formula E race win.Barnard will now race on home soil in London alongside his McLaren teammate Sam Bird. The duo will sport a new blue-and-white livery and race suits. He recently shared pictures of him in his London-special race suit and captioned it on Instagram, “One city to go.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland’s rise to champion: Rare childhood moments highlighted in touching video The double-header marks the grand finale of Formula E Season 11, scheduled from July 25–27.","Taylor Barnard takes the number 3 spot in Formula E Driver Standings.

Former World No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas has ended his brief coaching partnership with Goran Ivanisevic after just two tournaments.

He supported Tsitsipas's decision to return to his father, noting, ""He had his best results with his father, his father knows him the best so I agree that is the right decision.""Their partnership started during the French Open but quickly soured.

He then retired with a back injury in the first round of Wimbledon against Valentin Royer.The relationship became strained when Ivanišević publicly criticised Tsitsipas's fitness. ""I was shocked. I have never seen a more unprepared player in my life. With this knee, I am three times more fit than him. This is really bad,"" the Croatian coach toldTsitsipas later hinted at his dissatisfaction, telling, ""It is very difficult to have dictators and people who speak negatively and you don't feel like they are close to you like family.""The 26-year-old has struggled to maintain his form over the past year.

IPL mini auction: Lot of interest for Cam Green | Wait ends for Prithvi Shaw, Sarfaraz Khan?

Poll Will the government give a green light for IPL matches at Chinnaswamy Stadium? Yes, definitely No, unlikely

NEW DELHI: The Indian Premier League (IPL) 2026 will begin on March 26 (Thursday) and conclude on May 31 (Sunday), with the dates emerging as the central takeaway from a meeting between franchise representatives and IPL authorities in Abu Dhabi on Monday evening, as per a Cricbuzz report. The confirmation of the Season 19 window brings clarity to teams planning their campaigns, even as uncertainty continues to loom over the venue for the opening match.The dates were formally communicated by IPL CEO Hemang Amin during a briefing held ahead of Tuesday’s auction. As per tradition, the tournament opener is staged in the home city of the defending champions, which would put Bengaluru’s M Chinnaswamy Stadium in line to host the curtain-raiser featuring Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB). However, the availability of the venue remains a major talking point among franchises attending the pre-auction meeting at the W Hotel in Abu Dhabi.The Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) has received only a conditional clearance from the state government to host IPL matches at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, subject to meeting stringent safety and security requirements. The hesitation stems from the tragic stampede on June 4 during RCB’s IPL title celebrations, which claimed at least 11 lives and left several others injured. Since then, the state government has consistently denied permission for major cricket matches at the venue, forcing the BCCI to relocate Women’s World Cup fixtures away from Bengaluru.Asked about the possibility of IPL 2026 starting at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, a senior BCCI official said, “We hope so,” adding that Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar had publicly expressed optimism. Shivakumar was recently quoted as saying the government was positive about hosting IPL matches and had asked Home Minister G Parameshwara to engage with KSCA officials to address concerns.While the schedule dominated discussions, the build-up to the IPL 2026 auction has also gathered momentum. The auction, to be held at the Etihad Arena in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday, will mark the third consecutive year the event takes place outside India, following Dubai and Jeddah. On the eve of the auction, the BCCI finalised the player pool by adding 19 names, including Bengal opener Abhimanyu Easwaran, New Zealand pacer Ben Sears and South African all-rounder Ethan Bosch.All ten franchises will be keen to assemble squads capable of challenging for the IPL 2026 title. A total of 77 slots are available, including 31 for overseas players. Kolkata Knight Riders have the most vacancies with 13, followed by Sunrisers Hyderabad with ten. From an initial list of 1,355 players, 359 have been shortlisted — 244 Indians and 115 overseas — with 40 players entering at the maximum base price of Rs 2 crore.The spotlight at the auction will be on marquee names such as Cameron Green, Liam Livingstone and Ravi Bishnoi. Green, in particular, is expected to attract aggressive bidding amid a skewed demand-supply ratio for seam-bowling all-rounders, with projections suggesting bids could cross Rs 25 crore. With the IPL 2026 schedule now locked in, franchises will hope the remaining uncertainties — especially around venues — are resolved well before the season begins.","The Indian Premier League (IPL) 2026 will begin on March 26 (Thursday) and conclude on May 31 (Sunday) The dates emerged as the central takeaway from a meeting between franchise representatives and IPL authorities in Abu Dhabi on Monday evening.

DHARAMSHALA:

Abhishek Sharma's sister is very proud of her brother, and India win

Varun big factor in potent attack

For a long time leading up to the T20 World Cup in 2024, India copped a lot of criticism for their rather conservative approach to batting in the format. When the transition happened under new coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Suryakumar Yadav , the batting line-up was filled with those who could play an ultra-aggressive brand of cricket.However, with India’s T20 World Cup title defence starting in less than two months at home, the batting has become a major cause for concern. For a team management that has primarily believed in a batting-heavy XI, it may be time to revisit its strategies.Barring Abhishek Sharma ’s starts at the top of the order, consistency has eluded the rest of the batters. With strike-rates falling, India may well be more comfortable not playing high-scoring games at all. Since the Asia Cup, most of the wins have come in matches in which India have chased below 160. Sunday night’s win in the third T20I against South Africa in challenging conditions in Dharamshala was another reference point. The Asia Cup campaign was similar.Over the last 12 months, for all the noise around India’s renewed approach based on uninhibited, uninterrupted power-hitting, it is the bowling department that has held the team together.In fact, it has actually been hard to hide the continued struggles of the batters.Scratch the surface and one will find that the problems run deeper than captain Suryakumar Yadav and vice-captain Shubman Gill’s poor form, which has become a coffee-table discussion these days.In the last 14 matches, Tilak Varma’s strike-rate has largely hovered below 120. He has gone past a strike-rate of 150 only twice. Much of this is because he is tasked with repairing the innings. The whimsical changes in the batting order haven’t let the others settle down. Axar Patel — identified as the floater in the line-up — too hasn’t been able to break free.There is much clamour for Sanju Samson’s inclusion but his numbers since facing the raw pace of England at home earlier this year aren’t very inspiring either.“I always try to give the team a good start. I have that intent so that the other batters can just play along the ground or probably take their time. So that’s what our team plan always been like. I have to express myself and take down the bowlers,” opener Abhishek Sharma said after Sunday’s big 7-wicket win.Incidentally, the other Indian batters took over 10 overs to score the remaining 58 runs after Abhishek fell for an 18-ball 35, with the score at 60 in 5.2 overs.Abhishek also backed Gill and Surya to come good. “Trust me, these two guys are going to win matches in World Cup and in this series as well,” he said. “Because I’ve been playing with them since so long, especially with Shubman, I know which match he can win and in what conditions, irrespective of the team. I hope everyone will see him coming good very soon and have faith in him.”With the batters struggling to live up to the hype, India’s bowling has been at the forefront of their T20 game. Varun Chakravarthy coming into the team with his consistently incisive and miserly spells is a cushion for the batters.As he showed on Sunday night, Varun can thrive in any condition. His unconventional deliveries are still hard to pick for players who don’t face him much. The bowling attack — comprising Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Hardik Pandya and Chakravarthy as frontline bowlers — is bound to test a lot of batting line-ups. If a couple of these bowlers have a good day together, they can be the difference even in high-scoring games.On a placid pitch in the second T20I in Chandigarh last week, South Africa posted 213 and still felt they were a few short. Yet the Indian batters fell 51 runs short even with dew having a heavy effect during the chase.With Chakravarthy’s induction, India can strike hard in the middle phase of the innings. Even in the Asia Cup final, Kuldeep Yadav and Chakravarthy restricted Pakistan to a low score, allowing India to scrape past the target. Most of the team’s recent T20I wins have been set up by the bowlers.There are just seven games left before the T20 World Cup starts. Five of them will be played against New Zealand in Jan after the squad is picked for the World Cup. One must not be surprised if India stop being so bullish about an ultra aggressive brand of batting and instead devise a game plan where the batters get a breather from the pressures of high-scoring games.",India's T20 World Cup title defence starts in less than two months at home. Most of the wins have come in matches in which India have chased below 160.

Franchise boom vs Test cricket: Tom Moody’s honest take

Australia XI:

Jake Weatherald, Travis Head, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Cameron Green, Alex Carey (wk), Josh Inglis, Pat Cummins (capt), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland

Fit-again opener Usman Khawaja was the biggest casualty as Australia named their XI for the third Ashes Test in Adelaide starting Wednesday, opting to back continuity at the top while recalling captain Pat Cummins and veteran spinner Nathan Lyon in a bid to seal the series. The decision to leave out Khawaja, who turns 39 this week, has cast fresh doubt over the future of one of Australia’s most experienced Test batters.Khawaja had back spasms and failed to open in the first Test victory against England in Perth. He was subsequently ruled out of the second Test in Brisbane as selectors opted for a reshuffled top order. Despite recovering fully, the selectors chose to persist with Travis Head and Jake Weatherald as openers, a pairing that has impressed across Australia’s last three innings. For Khawaja, an 85-Test veteran enduring a lean run of form, the omission is a significant blow.Australia captain Pat Cummins, however, insisted the door is not closed. “Potentially, yes,” Cummins said when asked if Khawaja could return. “We’re picking a side each week based on what we think is best. One of Uzzie’s great strengths is that he’s scored runs at the top and in the middle. If we didn’t think he could come straight in, he wouldn’t be here in the squad.”Cummins himself returns to the XI after missing the first two Tests with a back injury, reclaiming the captaincy from Steve Smith. The fast bowler said he was fully fit and ready to operate without restrictions. “If I played in Brisbane, it would have been limited overs. This week it’s just go and play like any other Test,” he said.Lyon is also back after being left out of the Gabba Test in favour of an all-pace attack. His inclusion means Brendan Doggett and Michael Neser make way, despite both contributing strongly in Australia’s eight-wicket win. Cummins acknowledged the tough calls, describing Neser and Doggett as “unlucky” but stressing the need for balance at Adelaide Oval.Australia’s batting core remains unchanged, with Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith and Cameron Green forming the middle order. Josh Inglis retains his spot at No.7, underlining the selectors’ faith in his batting ability, while Alex Carey continues as wicketkeeper. Smith, who missed a training session earlier in the week due to illness, was back in the nets on Tuesday and is set to play.With Australia holding the momentum and the urn within reach, the focus is firmly on sealing the series. For Khawaja, though, the immediate spotlight is harsher — a reminder that even experience and past runs offer no guarantees in a settled and winning side.","Khawaja had back spasms and failed to open in the first Test victory against England in Perth.

Ashish Nehra interview: Gujarat Titans head coach backs out of form Shubman Gill

Poll Do you believe Suryakumar Yadav is capable of regaining his form in upcoming matches? Yes, he's a talented player. No, he seems out of form. It's hard to say.

NEW DELHI: Suryakumar Yadav may be short of runs, but India’s T20I captain remains firm in his belief that form is not the issue. After another modest outing in India’s seven-wicket win over South Africa in the third T20I on Sunday, Suryakumar acknowledged the lean patch but insisted it was only a matter of time before the runs returned.Suryakumar scored 12 off 11 balls before falling to Lungi Ngidi, extending a difficult run that has seen him struggle for consistency. Barring a fluent 75 against Bangladesh in Hyderabad on October 24 and an unbeaten 47 against Pakistan in the Asia Cup in September, runs have been hard to come by. The sequence has now dragged on for 21 innings and has pushed his T20I average in 2025 down to 14.20, with two matches still left in the series.Yet, the skipper struck an optimistic note at the post-match presentation. “I've been batting beautifully in the nets. When the runs have to come, they'll come. Not out of form, definitely out of runs,” Suryakumar said, brushing aside concerns over his personal returns.More than individual numbers, Suryakumar underlined India’s response after their defeat in the second T20I. “I think this sport teaches you a lot of things.How you come back into the series is more important,” he said. “We wanted to go back to basics, do the same things we were doing in Cuttack, and the results were on our side.” He added that lessons from the loss in New Chandigarh were addressed collectively. “The bowlers sat together, we had a good team meeting as well. ”India’s bowlers set up the victory, led by player of the match Arshdeep Singh , who returned to his “tried and tested basic methods” after an ordinary previous game. “It was one off day… so it feels nice to do this,” Arshdeep said, dedicating the Man-of-the-Match award to his 10-month-old niece watching from the stands.South Africa skipper Aiden Markram credited India’s pacers for dismantling the top order early, while also acknowledging Abhishek Sharma ’s brisk 18-ball 35 that put the chase beyond reach. Varun Chakravarthy, who struck twice in the middle overs, said honest conversations after the last match helped India regroup.","Suryakumar Yadav says he is not out of form, just out of runs. India captain scored 12 off 11 balls in third T20I win over South Africa.

Mahieka Sharma's Instagram story

NEW DELHI: Ace all-rounder Hardik Pandya 's landmark night in Indian colours found a warm echo off the field, as girlfriend Mahieka Sharma's celebratory post captured the emotion behind another defining chapter in the match-winner's T20I career. Moments after Pandya entered an exclusive global club on Sunday, Mahieka took to her social media handle - on Instagram, with a glowing tribute — “100 Babyyyyy… Rockstar Legend Hero” — summing up the significance of the achievement in her own exuberant style.On the field, Pandya joined elite company by becoming only the third Indian bowler to complete 100 T20I wickets, after fellow pacers Arshdeep Singh and Jasprit Bumrah. His economical spell of 1 for 23 in three overs took his tally to exactly 100 wickets in 123 matches, at an average of 26.78, with best figures of 4 for 16 and three four-wicket hauls to his name.But the milestone went beyond wickets alone. Pandya also entered a rare global bracket of T20I all-rounders with 1,000-plus runs, 100-plus sixes and 100 or more wickets in the shortest format of the game. He now stands alongside Zimbabwe's Sikandar Raza, Afghanistan's Mohammed Nabi and Malaysia's Virandeep Singh — and carved out a unique sub-category by becoming the first fast-bowling all-rounder in history to achieve the double of 1,000 T20I runs and 100 wickets.With the bat, Pandya's numbers underline his value across phases of the game. He has scored 1,939 runs in 123 T20Is at an average of 28.10 and a strike rate of 141.53, striking 101 sixes and registering six half-centuries — figures that reflect both power and adaptability.Mahieka's post added a personal layer to the achievement, turning a statistical milestone into a moment of shared pride.","Hardik Pandya becomes only the third Indian bowler to complete 100 T20I wickets.

NEW DELHI: Ace all-rounder Hardik Pandya reached a major milestone on Sunday by taking his 100th T20I wicket during the India vs South Africa 3rd T20I in Dharamsala. With this wicket, he became the first Indian cricketer to record both 100 wickets and 1,000 runs in T20 internationals.Pandya returned to India colours in the opening T20I in Cuttack after being out of action since September 26, 2025. He marked his comeback with an unbeaten 59 off 28 balls, hitting six fours and four sixes.He also took one wicket for 16 runs in two overs, helping India secure a 101-run win and earning the Player of the Match award.In the last game, however, India faced a heavy defeat, with South Africa levelling the series 1-1.With India's early domination in the third T20I, it seems as if they are on their way to take the lead back in the five-match series.By completing 100 wickets, Pandya joined pacers Arshdeep Singh and Jasprit Bumrah as only the third Indian bowler to reach the milestone in the format. Arshdeep has 107 wickets from 69 matches with best figures of 4 for 9, while Bumrah has 101 wickets in 81 games with best figures of 3 for 7.Before this game, Pandya had 99 wickets in 122 T20Is at an economy of 8.22, with a best of 4 for 16.Worldwide, only four all-rounders, Shakib Al Hasan, Mohammad Nabi, Sikandar Raza and Virandeep Singh, had previously achieved the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in T20Is. Pandya is now the fifth to join this select group.","Hardik Pandya takes 100th T20I wicket during India's win over South Africa.

NEW DELHI: India’s left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh attributed his impressive showing in the third T20I against South Africa to keeping things simple and making the most of the favourable conditions in Dharamsala.Arshdeep finished with figures of 2 for 13 from his four overs, laying the foundation for India’s seven-wicket victory over South Africa in the third T20I at the HPCA Stadium on Sunday, an effort that also earned him the Player of the Match award.“Nothing changed. I just pitched the ball in the right areas and tried to get as much help from the wicket. There was some help in the wicket, the conditions were cold as well, so there was enough swing and seam. I just tried to keep it simple, hit the right areas, and got the reward,” Arshdeep said after the match.The left-armer also expressed satisfaction at bouncing back strongly after an off day in New Chandigarh. “When I walked onto the ground, everyone was telling me this is also your home ground. So the first thing I told them was, no, this is not my home ground - so that felt better.”“After that, just sticking to the basics, doing the basics right, and trusting my skill set.When you play at this level, there are some days when you won’t execute the things you want to do. It was one off day (last game), so it feels nice to do this (bowl well in this game).”Speaking about the review taken against Reeza Hendricks, Arshdeep said, “It was Surya bhai who wanted to get some suspense in there. The moment it hit the pad, I knew it was out. When I got the approval from Jitesh as well, we knew we were going for the review. He just wanted to wait, chat for a bit, and then take it.”On the review call involving Dewald Brevis, which was eventually not taken, Arshdeep said, ""As a bowler, you want to take every review possible (and burst into laughter). I felt it hit the pad twice, so that was the confusion. Next time, I’ll take care of that.""Meanwhile, wrist spinner Varun Chakaravarthy returned figures of 2 for 11 and became the second fastest Indian to reach 50 men’s T20I wickets. He admitted the biting cold made things difficult but credited the team’s preparation. ""I actually wasn’t aware of the milestone, so thank you for telling me. It was doing a bit early on when the fast bowlers were bowling, there was some seam movement.”“But overall, the conditions were very tough. I’ve never played at a ground this cold, so I did find it quite challenging. No, not at all. This (chilly weather) can never happen in Chennai.”Reflecting on what changed after the defeat in New Chandigarh, Chakaravarthy said, “We had a proper bowling meeting and some very honest conversations. We identified where we went wrong and focused on the right approach. Credit has to go to the management and the bowlers. It was a two-way discussion, and it worked really well.”Asked about his approach, the spinner added, “I was just trying to stick to my strengths. Today, the ball was skidding more than turning, so my focus was on skidding the ball on to the batter rather than trying to force too much turn. It feels really good (second fastest to 50 T20I wickets). As long as I’m playing for India and contributing with wickets, I’ll always feel good.""",Arshdeep finished with figures of 2 for 13 from his four overs. Varun Chakaravarthy became the second fastest Indian to reach 50 men’s T20I wickets.

The Sharjah Warriorz secured an 11-run victory over the Gulf Giants at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Monday in the ILT20 Season 4. Tom Abell 's outstanding 68 runs and Matheesha Pathirana's three-wicket haul were instrumental in the Warriorz's second consecutive win, as they posted 174/6 before restricting the Giants to 163/9.Tom Abell's 41-ball innings included five fours and three sixes, while Wasim Akram and Pathirana claimed three wickets each to secure the win.The Giants' chase got off to a poor start as Wasim Akram and Taskin Ahmed dismissed Pathum Nissanka and James Vince early. Despite Rahmanullah Gurbaz's quick 30 runs, Pathirana's slower ball ended his innings during a wicket-maiden over.Azmatullah Omarzai and Moeen Ali attempted to stabilize the innings with a 79-run partnership. Omarzai scored 41 off 26 balls before falling to Akram, while Ali anchored the innings with 45 runs off 41 balls.The Giants needed 51 runs from the final five overs but struggled to maintain momentum. Pathirana dismissed Matthew Forde and Ali, while Pretorius removed Asif Khan and Liam Dawson in the death overs.The Warriorz's batting innings saw early aggression from Tom Kohler-Cadmore before his dismissal by Fred Klaassen.Abell took charge in the fourth over, scoring 19 runs off Klaassen's over.Johnson Charles struggled with his timing and fell to Forde for 12 runs.

I'm not at my best yet, but I'm improving, and this performance gives me a lot of confidence. It's also encouraging to see Sri Lankan players doing well in T20 cricket with a World Cup coming up at home. For now, I'm just focusing on my process and staying calm,"" said Player of the Match Matheesha Pathirana.""We've been coming very close in recent games, and winning those small, decisive moments makes all the difference.

With two prominent franchises — Kolkata Knight Riders (Rs 64.30 crore) and Chennai Super Kings (Rs 43.40 crore) — armed with hefty purses, Cameron Green, Quinton de Kock and Liam Livingstone could be in line for big paydays at the IPL mini-auction in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday. It will be the third successive overseas IPL auction, following earlier editions in Dubai and Jeddah.A cumulative purse of Rs 237.55 crore will be available as the 10 teams look to fill 77 slots. While Lucknow Super Giants (Rs 22.95 crore) are another major buyer, Mumbai Indians, with just Rs 2.75 crore, sit at the other end of the spectrum. With their core largely settled, MI, Punjab Kings (Rs 11.50 crore) and Gujarat Titans (Rs 12.90 crore) are unlikely to be major players.Punjab Kings’ auction plans, however, will get a boost from the presence of their captain Shreyas Iyer, who has flown to Abu Dhabi to attend the proceedings even as head coach Ricky Ponting gives the mini-auction a miss.Green is expected to attract strong interest as franchises hunt for seam-bowling all rounders despite the Impact Player rule. If he strikes big, the 26-year-old could join fellow Australians Mitchell Starc (Rs 24.75 crore) and Pat Cummins (Rs 20.50 crore), who fetched massive sums in recent auctions.However, under the IPL’s maximum-fee rule, a foreign player’s price at a mini-auction is capped at the lower of the highest retention slab (Rs 18 crore) and the highest price at the previous mega auction (Rs 27 crore, paid for Rishabh Pant in 2025), meaning Green cannot earn more than Rs 18 crore.Gujarat Titans, with a limited purse of only Rs 12.9 crore, may go looking for a finisher as the rest of the squad looks well-balanced, like it has always been.Gujarat Titans owner Jinal Mehta is excited about the upcoming season. In Ashish Nehra and the rest of the coaching staff, he sees a unit worthy of keeping the momentum going.“Ashish has been instrumental in shaping the culture and direction of the team. His and the coaching staff’s consistency have helped build a strong, united group. The success we’ve achieved in a short span is reflective of this. We’re confident the franchise will continue to perform under him,” Mehta told TOI.He’s not too worried about the franchise’s limited purse at the auction either. “Our purse position at the auction reflects the fact that we have been able to retain the core of our squad, which was a key priority for us.""With only a few available slots to fill, we go into the auction with confidence in the group we already have; and will look to make additions that best complement group. We believe in building sustainably and making decisions that strengthen the team in the long term,” he says.Abhimanyu Easwaran has received a late boost ahead of the auction. The BCCI has added the Bengal captain’s name to the final auction list, TOI has learnt. He will enter the auction at a base price of Rs 30 lakh.(Maharashtra) Batter | Base price: Rs 75 lakhShaw will hope for better luck at the auction after going unsold last year. The aggressive opener was Maharashtra’s highest run getter in the first leg of the Ranji Trophy. He scored 183 runs in seven matches in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.(Mumbai) Batter | Base price: Rs 75 lakhA big name in first-class cricket, Sarfaraz went unsold in the last two IPL auctions. He has been in scorching form this season batting at No. 3 in the Mushtaq Ali Trophy, scoring 100* (47 balls) vs Assam, 52 (40) vs Kerala, 28 (15) vs Odisha and 64 (25) vs Haryana.(J&K) Bowler | Base price: Rs 30 lakhThe seamer has been the most successful bowler in the Ranji Trophy over the last two seasons, picking up 44 wickets at 13.93 in 2024–25 and 29 wickets in five matches at the same average this season. The Baramulla-born pacer has never played in the IPL. Will that change this time?(MP) Allrounder | Base price: Rs 2 croreBought for a whopping Rs 23.5 crore by Kolkata Knight Riders last year, Venkatesh Iyer is unlikely to command a similar price this time. An ordinary IPL 2025 — 142 runs in 11 matches at 20.28 — saw him even dropped from the KKR XI. However, the 30-year-old offers experience and pedigree.(Punjab) Wicketkeeper-batter | Base price: Rs 30 lakhSalil Arora has caught the attention of IPL scouts with a stunning blitz in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, smashing 125 off 45 balls (including a 39-ball century) with 11 sixes and nine fours.

A total of 350 cricketers, including 240 Indians, will be available at the IPL auction in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday, December 16. South African wicketkeeper-batter Quinton de Kock has been added late to the final list. Initially, 1,390 players had registered for the auction. This number was reduced to 1,005 before 350 players were shortlisted. The 10 franchises will bid for 77 slots, including 31 overseas positions, ahead of the 19th edition of the IPL.The auction will start with Indian batters Prithvi Shaw and Sarfaraz Khan, both with a base price of Rs 75 lakh. Shaw played regularly in the IPL between 2018 and 2024 but went unsold last season. Sarfaraz has not played in the league since 2021. The auction list also features Australia’s Cameron Green and Jake Fraser-McGurk, New Zealand batter Devon Conway, and South Africa’s David Miller. All four have set a base price of Rs 2 crore.With limited budgets for most teams and several slots to fill at the IPL 2026 mini auction, Indian uncapped players are expected to draw interest. Here are five such players who could attract attention.Prashant has represented Uttar Pradesh in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and the under-23 one-day knockouts, travelling between Kolkata and Mumbai. He is a left-handed batter and orthodox spin bowler. With a base price of Rs 30 lakh, the 20-year-old could attract significant bids.Auqib Nabi (registered as Auqib Dar) is a fast bowler from Jammu & Kashmir who has improved his death-over skills. He took 15 wickets in seven matches in the recent Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy at an economy rate under eight. He has previously worked as a net bowler for Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad.Krains Fuletra is a left-arm wristspinner who has played two T20 matches for Saurashtra. He was picked as a net bowler by Sunrisers Hyderabad last season and was close to joining the squad as a replacement for Adam Zampa but was not registered for the auction at that time. Saurashtra captain Jaydev Unadkat had recommended him to the franchise.Ravi Singh, a 24-year-old left-handed wicketkeeper-batter, has emerged as a T20 player for Railways. His match-winning innings against Vidarbha in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy league stage was watched by scouts. With a base price of Rs 30 lakh, he is considered a backup option with finishing ability and wicketkeeping skills.Kartik Sharma, 19, is a lower-order batter and finisher known for hitting big sixes. He has scored 334 runs in 12 T20 matches at a strike rate of 164, hitting 28 sixes. Clips of his hitting have been shared widely, earning attention from players including Kevin Pietersen and R Ashwin. His performances have helped Rajasthan reach the knockouts of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, winning six of seven matches.","A total of 350 cricketers, including 240 Indians, will be available at the IPL auction.

'Hold one end like Virat Kohli': Former India wicketkeeper’s blunt message to Shubman Gill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-south-africa/hold-one-end-like-virat-kohli-former-india-wicketkeepers-blunt-message-to-shubman-gill/articleshow/125986596.cms,"India's Shubman Gill (AP Photo/Ashwini Bhatia)

Ashish Nehra interview: Gujarat Titans head coach backs out of form Shubman Gill

Former India wicketkeeper-batter Deep Dasgupta believes Shubman Gill needs to redefine his role in India’s T20I side by becoming the anchor around whom the rest of the batting revolves, much like Virat Kohli did for years in the format.Gill, India’s current T20I vice-captain, returned to the shortest format during the Asia Cup and was named Suryakumar Yadav ’s deputy. However, his output has not matched expectations. The Indian Test and ODI captain has scored only 291 runs from 15 T20I innings so far, a modest return for a batter of his calibre.Dasgupta feels Gill’s value lies not in explosive strike rates but in providing stability at one end. Speaking to PTI Videos, he said most of India’s current batters are natural stroke-makers, which makes Gill’s role different and more structural.“For me, Shubman’s role is very different. If you look at the rest of the players, most of them are stroke players. That is the kind of role Virat played so well for so many years, holding one end while everyone else played around him,” Dasgupta said.He added that Gill should be seen as the pivot of the batting unit rather than someone expected to match the strike rates of others.“I see Shubman in that role Virat played. He is the fulcrum around whom the rest of the batting revolves.Not necessarily with a very high strike rate, but by being more consistent than the others,” he explained.India, the defending champions, will begin their T20 World Cup title defence against the USA in Mumbai on February 7. With limited matches left before the tournament, Dasgupta admitted there would be concern around form, particularly with both Gill and captain Suryakumar Yadav struggling for runs.“Ideally, you would want them to start firing again. If you want players to be fearless, that comes at a cost, and that cost is consistency. That is something you have to be mindful of,” he said.He acknowledged the lack of game time before the World Cup but backed the quality of the players to come good. “We would want Surya and everyone to be in form, but they are good enough. Hopefully, it is just a matter of time,” Dasgupta added.On the ongoing discussion around split coaching for India following their Test series whitewash against South Africa, Dasgupta dismissed the idea as a temporary fix. He stressed that India’s red-ball issues require a deeper and more holistic solution.“Those are band-aid solutions. Where the Indian Test team is right now, it needs a more rounded solution. Otherwise, you are just treating the symptoms, and that becomes a knee-jerk reaction,” he said.Dasgupta also weighed in on the future of senior batters Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli ahead of the 2027 World Cup, saying their ability was never in doubt. The real question, according to him, is about sustainability and workload.“They are absolute giants of the game. It would be foolish to doubt their credentials. The key is sustainability. I am glad they are playing the Vijay Hazare Trophy, and I hope they continue playing competitive cricket, both domestic and overseas, leading up to 2027,” he said.On Chennai Super Kings signing Sanju Samson , Dasgupta advised caution regarding leadership responsibilities. While he expects Samson to be part of the leadership group, he believes the franchise should allow him time to settle into the setup.“I would like to see him eased into leadership rather than being forced into it straight away,” Dasgupta concluded.","Former India wicketkeeper-batter Deep Dasgupta believes Shubman Gill needs to redefine his role in India’s T20I side by becoming the anchor around whom the rest of the batting revolves.

Sri Lankan authorities plan to arrest the country's former men's cricket team captain, Arjuna Ranatunga , on corruption charges linked to his tenure as petroleum minister, a court was told on Monday.Ranatunga and his brother are accused of altering the procedure for awarding long-term oil procurement contracts and instead making spot purchases at higher prices, according to a corruption watchdog.""The total loss to the state from 27 purchases is 800 million rupees,"" the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption told the court, as reported by news agency AFP. The amount was equivalent to just over $5 million at the time the deals were made in 2017.The commission told Colombo Magistrate Asanga Bodaragama that Arjuna Ranatunga was currently abroad and would be arrested upon his return.His elder brother, Dhammika Ranatunga, who was chairman of the state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corporation at the time, was arrested on Monday and later released on bail.The magistrate imposed a travel ban on Dhammika, who holds dual citizenship of Sri Lanka and the United States.The next hearing in the case is scheduled for March 13.Arjuna Ranatunga, 62, captained Sri Lanka to victory in the 1996 Cricket World Cup, defeating Australia in the final.The case involving the Ranatunga brothers is part of a broader crackdown by the government of Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who came to power last year after pledging to act against corruption.Another brother, Prasanna Ranatunga, a former tourism minister, was arrested last month in connection with an insurance fraud case. That matter is pending.Prasanna Ranatunga had earlier been convicted in June 2022 for extorting money from a businessman and is currently serving a two-year suspended prison sentence.","Arjuna Ranatunga and his brother are accused of altering the procedure for awarding long-term oil procurement contracts.

Franchise boom vs Test cricket: Tom Moody’s honest take

England captain Ben Stokes has urged his side to dig deep and show greater fight as they head into a must win third Ashes Test against Australia, with the series slipping away at 2-0.Speaking ahead of the Adelaide Test starting Wednesday, Stokes said his players must respond with intensity and resilience after defeats at Perth and Brisbane. England have made one change from the side beaten by eight wickets at the Gabba, recalling fast bowler Josh Tongue in place of Gus Atkinson.The decision means there is once again no place for specialist spinner Shoaib Bashir, despite conditions expected to offer assistance to slow bowlers. Instead, batting all-rounder Will Jacks will fill the spin role, a call Stokes said was made after serious internal discussions.“I’ve said everything I needed to say over the last couple of days,” Stokes said. “Now it’s about what people see out on the field in Adelaide. Every situation you find yourself in, you have to fight. You look your opposition in the eye and show a bit of dog. That’s what fight means to me.”Bashir’s continued omission will come as a blow for the young spinner, who has now missed out in Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide. He struggled in an internal warm-up match earlier in the tour, conceding more than a run a ball without taking a wicket, and also went wicketless for England Lions against Australia A last week.Stokes admitted the call was tough but said the balance of the side took priority.“It’s disappointing for Bash, but we feel Jacksy at No. 8 strengthens our batting,” he said. “We’re 2-0 down and we have to give ourselves the best possible chance with both bat and ball.”Australia, meanwhile, have recalled their frontline spinner Nathan Lyon , a move that had raised questions from the home camp even before England named their XI. “I would’ve been surprised if their No. 1 spinner didn’t play,” Lyon said earlier.Tongue’s return brings encouragement for England. He was their leading wicket-taker against India earlier this year and claimed five wickets in his only previous Ashes appearance at Lord’s in 2023, dismissing Steve Smith in both innings. Atkinson makes way after managing only three wickets in the series at an average of 78.66.With the Ashes on the line, Stokes made it clear England’s focus is no longer on words or selection debates, but on delivering a response on the field in Adelaide.","England captain Ben Stokes has urged his side to dig deep and show greater fight as they head into a must win third Ashes Test against Australia.

IPL mini auction: Lot of interest for Cam Green | Wait ends for Prithvi Shaw, Sarfaraz Khan?

The ‘TATA IPL 2026 Auction War Room’ on JioHotstar offered an early look into how franchises could shape their squads ahead of the IPL 2026 mini auction scheduled for tomorrow. The mock auction simulation saw experts analyse team strategies, budgets and squad balance, with Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings emerging as two of the most talked-about teams.In the simulation, Cameron Green emerged as the biggest buy, fetching a massive ₹30.5 crore bid from KKR. Chennai Super Kings, in contrast, were projected to adopt a more measured approach, focusing on current form, squad balance and long-term depth rather than headline-making purchases.JioStar expert Robin Uthappa shared insights into both franchises’ thinking. He said CSK were always expected to target a middle-order all-rounder but would be cautious in the real auction. According to Uthappa, CSK would likely cap their spending at around ₹20 crore to retain flexibility for other Indian and overseas players. However, in the mock setup, he admitted he was willing to go as high as ₹35 crore for a player like Green, whom he believes should bat at No. 3.Uthappa also explained KKR’s decision to pick Matheesha Pathirana for ₹13 crore, calling it a move driven by clear planning. He said KKR needed a specialist death bowler and felt Pathirana could thrive under their coaching setup.Uthappa added that returning to the auction pool after a lean phase could motivate the Sri Lankan pacer, and that a change of franchise often helps players rediscover form.Former CSK star Suresh Raina spoke about Sarfaraz Khan being picked by Chennai for ₹7 crore in the mock auction. Raina said Sarfaraz’s current form made the buy a smart one, pointing out that he is batting with confidence and possesses a wide range of shots. He felt that even a few match-winning performances would justify the price, especially in a team like CSK that values role clarity and winning games.Raina also outlined CSK’s overall auction approach, saying key areas had been addressed in the War Room exercise. With Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin not available, CSK strengthened their spin department by picking Rahul Chahar and Wanindu Hasaranga. Their pace attack was bolstered with Anrich Nortje, valued for his pace and ability to bowl consistent yorkers.Looking ahead to the main auction, Raina suggested CSK could revisit their interest in Matheesha Pathirana, especially given concerns around death bowling. With more players set to enter the auction pool, the franchise is expected to continue prioritising balance, form and system fit as they prepare for IPL 2026.Tune-ins: Catch all the action from the TATA IPL 2026 mini-auction, December 16, 2:30 PM onwards, LIVE on JioHotstar and Star Sports Network","IPL 2026 mini auction takes place on December 16.

The 10 franchises will bid for 77 slots, including 31 overseas positions, ahead of the 19th edition of the IPL.The auction will begin with India batters Prithvi Shaw and Sarfaraz Khan, both of whom have set a base price of Rs 75 lakh.

If they are unable to buy him back at a lower price, they are expected to look at other overseas fast bowlers. Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bengaluru are also in the market for overseas pace options.Lucknow Super Giants have released Bishnoi and could either look to replace him or attempt to re-sign him if bidding stays controlled.

NEW DELHI:

Fans throw objects, vandalise stadium after Messi leaves early | Hyderabad next

It’s time for reels, memes and thrills. Finally, Lionel Messi graced the Capital with his friends, Luis Suarez and Rodrigo de Paul, and entertained a 30,000 odd gathering of the city’s elite fans at the sun-soaked Arun Jaitley Stadium on Monday.The next most-popular word the city is breathing these days, AQI, hovered around 451 which is marked severe. Braving the unhealthy air, parents escorted their children to catch a glimpse of the Argentinian superstar, who glided into the stadium at half past four in the afternoon, wrapped in a cloud of security personnel. Thankfully, they weren’t over bearing. They allowed the three musketeers from Inter Miami, the MLS Cup winners in football in the US, to take a lap of honour, kick around two dozen footballs into the crowd that went delirious, and enjoy a kickabout with kids. Perhaps, no one alerted them about the Delhi air.Divyansh and Manik travelled all the way from Ludhiana and managed to catch one of the balls that landed in the terraces. They walked out clutching it like a baby. “Cannot frame words to how happy we are,” breathless, they could barely blurt.Academy boys and girls, who got the opportunity to pass the ball to Messi, would remember forever the late afternoon of delight. Something they will share with their grandchildren some 60 years on.The delegates and the fortunate ones who managed a close look at the football legend in a pink tee, were starstruck. Messi, too, regaled them with his boyish grin. Never for a moment, since he landed in Kolkata on Saturday, did the smile leave his face.The unseemly Kolkata incident seemed a distant memory. On Saturday, irate fans ripped up seats and invaded the Salt Lake Stadium pitch after feeling duped by poor organisation where they could barely get a glimpse of the eight-times Ballon d’Or winner despite paying a bomb for tickets. Events in Hyderabad and Mumbai followed without any sore points and the Capital proved no different.However, two serious Messi fans did point out, “The organisers could have arranged something for the kids on the ground rather than keep them waiting for two hours.”Messi’s arrival was delayed by an hour, but one can guess that the children won’t complain.What followed was a photo session with the Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta and chairman of the International Cricket Council (ICC) Jay Shah. Shah presented Messi, Suarez and de Paul with T20 World Cup tickets, a cricket bat, and Indian team jerseys.Former India captain Bhaichung Bhutia also shared the stage with the trio and former India goalkeeper, Aditi Chauhan, got her jersey signed by Inter Miami mates.Ranked 142, India’s struggles on and off the football pitch were a constant source of comparison as Messi walked the stadium waving at the fans. Does he know the dark state of Indian football where the leagues cannot start because there is no one willing to sponsor it? Unlikely. A score or more miles away, across town, the Football House wears a desolate look, frustrated by court hearings and paucity of funds.Dusk descended gently on the stadium. Messi took over the microphone and served the parting shot. “It was beautiful to receive all the love and support. I knew it was there, but to receive it first hand was, well, amazing,” Messi told the crowd, in Spanish. “I will definitely be back.” The crowd cheered, grasping the essence of the words even though the language was alien.Messi spoke the language of football. Everyone present understood it — one and all.","Lionel Messi entertained a 30,000 odd gathering of the city's elite fans at the sun-soaked Arun Jaitley Stadium on Monday.

Lionel Messi India tour: Inside story of what went wrong in Kolkata

NEW DELHI: The footballing god descended upon the city, and the Lionel Messi GOAT India Tour, which had begun in disorder, found its finish in Delhi at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, where fans gathered to see a player whose actions on the field often defy explanation. What mattered most was that the tour ended the way it was meant to, after a chaotic opening in Kolkata on Saturday.The stands at the stadium were filled with spectators, while a small group of Indian celebrities and dignitaries watched from inside the ground, as the city played host to one of the world’s most recognisable athletes. For many, it was the chance to be close to a figure who has shaped the sport over the last two decades.Messi spoke briefly in Spanish, a language unfamiliar to most in the crowd, saying, ""Gracias Delhi! Hasta pronto"", a moment that drew a loud cheer from the stands.Addressing the crowd in Spanish, Messi said, ""Thank you for all the affection you have shown us here in India over these days. Truly, it was a unique experience for us to be able to share this. Although it was intense and very short, it was wonderful to receive all this love, which I already knew was there, but experiencing it firsthand was incredible.""He added, ""Everything you did for us over these days was astonishing, pure madness. So thank you all for the love, and we will surely return someday — perhaps to play a match or on some other occasion — but we will definitely visit again. Thank you very much, thank you.""After arriving at the stadium, Messi walked around the ground smiling and watched the 7x7 celebrity match conclude, as spectators — many wearing Argentina’s blue and white jersey with No. 10 — chanted his name. He stood waving to the crowd, something he could not do in Kolkata, where he had been surrounded by politicians and their aides at the Salt Lake Stadium.Messi was later seen kicking the ball towards the stands along with Inter Miami teammates Luis Suarez and Rodrigo De Paul while taking a round of the stadium, which recorded an attendance of around 25,000. He also felicitated the Minerva Academy football team.The programme appeared designed around Messi, and he moved through it smoothly. Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta, ICC Chairman Jay Shah, DDCA president Rohan Jaitley and former India football captain Bhaichung Bhutia were present with him towards the end of the 30-minute event.Earlier in the day, Messi arrived in Delhi for the final leg of the GOAT India Tour after his flight from Mumbai was delayed due to weather conditions. He was scheduled to land around 10:45am, but fog delayed his charter flight. He eventually landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport at around 2:30pm and proceeded to the Leela Palace Hotel for a meet-and-greet with a select group of people.","Messi arrived in Delhi for the final leg of the GOAT India Tour after his flight from Mumbai was delayed due to weather conditions.

Fans throw objects, vandalise stadium after Messi leaves early | Hyderabad next

Indian shooting great Abhinav Bindra struck a thoughtful note on Sunday as the country continued to be swept by what many have described as “Messi mania”. With Lionel Messi currently on a four-city tour of India, set to conclude on Monday in New Delhi with a football clinic at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, Bindra used the moment to raise a broader question about India’s sporting priorities.Bindra was careful to make it clear that his comments were not aimed at criticising Messi. Instead, the Olympic gold medallist asked whether India is truly investing in building a sporting culture or simply celebrating global superstars from a distance.Messi’s India visit began last Saturday with a largely underwhelming stop in Kolkata, before moving more smoothly through Hyderabad and Mumbai. Across cities, the tour has attracted massive crowds, exclusive VIP interactions and intense media coverage. While the enthusiasm highlighted India’s fascination with global sporting icons, the spotlight often extended to politicians and Bollywood celebrities, something that appeared to trouble Bindra.In a detailed post on X, Bindra said he holds deep respect and admiration for Messi, calling him a rare athlete whose journey goes beyond sport. He acknowledged Messi’s rise from a child overcoming physical challenges to a footballer who redefined excellence, and said he fully understands the commercial realities, branding power and appeal of modern sporting icons.However, Bindra admitted that the scale and nature of the celebrations left him uneasy. He expressed concern about the amount of money and energy spent on the four-city tour at a time when India’s grassroots sporting ecosystem continues to struggle for attention and funding.He pointed to the lack of accessible playgrounds, trained coaches and structured development pathways for young athletes, wondering what could have been achieved if even a small portion of the resources spent on high-profile events had been redirected towards these foundations. While he acknowledged that people are free to spend their money as they choose, Bindra said the contrast made him reflect on missed opportunities for long-term impact.According to Bindra, great sporting nations are not built through isolated spectacles but through systems that nurture talent patiently over time. He stressed that inspiration alone is not enough, even when it comes from icons like Messi. What matters, he said, is pairing inspiration with intent and sustained commitment.Bindra concluded by saying that the most meaningful way to honour legends is not through grand gestures or fleeting moments of access, but by ensuring that young children across India have fields to play on, coaches to guide them and a genuine chance to dream. That, he argued, is how sporting cultures take root and how lasting legacies are created.",Lionel Messi is currently on a four-city tour of India.

Poll What do you think caused the chaos during Messi's event in Kolkata? Poor organisation Crowd mismanagement Insufficient security

NEW DELHI: Bidhannagar Police Commissioner Mukesh Kumar has revealed the reasons behind the anger and chaos that erupted during the Kolkata leg of Lionel Messi 's GOAT India Tour on December 13, pointing squarely at mismanagement by the organisers.Kumar said the event at the Salt Lake Stadium, originally scheduled for nearly two hours, was cut short to just 20 minutes, triggering the crowd's unrest. “When you cut a 1 hour 40-minute event to 20 minutes, this is bound to happen. It is a fallout of mismanagement. We have arrested one person and prepared a list of people to be summoned,” he said, as quoted by The Indian Express.Satadru Dutta, chief organiser of Messi's India tour, was arrested following the fiasco. A Bidhannagar court rejected his bail plea, and he was remanded to 14 days of judicial custody. The commissioner indicated that CCTV footage is being reviewed and more arrests are likely. “No permission for water bottles was given. The additional guest list was not given to us. Vendors, too, will be questioned. All those identified will be arrested,” Kumar said.The police chief explained how the situation escalated despite tight security. “Everything was under control until 10 am. However, the matter escalated at 11:48 am, four minutes before Messi had left the venue. The crowd started shouting ‘boo boo', and we could sense their dissatisfaction. Messi's security team swiftly escorted him out, and as fans saw him leave, they began throwing bottles, chairs, and other objects onto the field,” Kumar added.Two suo motu cases have been registered against Dutta and unidentified individuals. Charges include provocation with intent to cause a riot, mischief, assault on public servants, and damage to public property under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the West Bengal Maintenance of Public Order Act, and the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.Kumar's statement highlights glaring lapses in coordination and crowd management, providing insight into why a highly anticipated return of the football superstar turned chaotic in Kolkata. The inquiry into the incident continues, with authorities vowing accountability for those responsible.","Lionel Messi's GOAT India Tour ended in chaos in Kolkata on December 13.

Lionel Messi India trip: Mumbai out in numbers for the superstar

Real Sociedad made a managerial change on Sunday, parting ways with head coach Sergio Francisco after a disappointing run that left the club 15th in La Liga, hovering just one point above the relegation zone. The decision came shortly after Real Oviedo, placed 19th, also dismissed their coach Luis Carrion following a brief and unsuccessful spell in charge.Sociedad’s downturn marks a sharp contrast from last season, when the club reached the Europa League last 16 and finished comfortably in mid-table. That campaign concluded with long-serving coach Imanol Alguacil stepping down, after which Francisco was promoted from the reserve side, Sanse, to take over the first team.However, results failed to improve under Francisco. La Real managed only four wins from 16 league games during his tenure, with performances steadily declining. A 2-1 home defeat to relegation-threatened Girona on Friday proved decisive, prompting the club to act.In an official statement, Real Sociedad confirmed, “Current Sanse coach Jon Ansotegi will be in charge of leading, provisionally, the team into the two matches they have before the Christmas break.”Ansotegi will begin his interim stint with a Copa del Rey tie away to Eldense on Tuesday, followed by a crucial league encounter against bottom-placed Levante on Saturday.Elsewhere, Real Oviedo also pulled the plug on their coaching setup after a heavy 4-0 loss to Sevilla on Sunday. The defeat sealed the fate of Luis Carrion, whose second spell at the club lasted just over two months.Carrion had been appointed in early October following the departure of Veljko Paunovic, but struggled to arrest Oviedo’s slide. Across eight league matches, his side collected just four points and failed to register a single victory, leaving the club entrenched in the relegation zone.","Real Sociedad part ways with head coach Sergio Francisco.

Marissa Ayers spotted at Dart’s NYC apartment and other clues fuel dating rumors



The New York Giants’ rising star quarterback, Jaxson Dart, has found himself at the center of romance speculation once again. Rumors first swirled back in October 2025, when Dart was spotted at a Halloween party with social media influencer and model Marissa Ayers. Since then, curiosity about his love life has only intensified, especially after Ayers was photographed alongside Dart’s mother, Kara Dart, during the Giants’ game against the New England Patriots on December 1. Fans and online sleuths are now piecing together every detail, eager for any confirmation.Despite the growing chatter, Dart has stayed tight-lipped about his personal life. “It’s a privilege to be the quarterback for the Giants,” he told Sports Illustrated in May 2025. “There’s not a better city to play for, there’s not a better place to be than New York.” His focus appears firmly on football, leaving fans to speculate about the nature of his relationship with Ayers. Meanwhile, Ayers herself has remained quiet, though her past social media content offers glimpses into her expectations in a partner. In a January 2025 TikTok, she admitted, “I'm just a very, very picky person. Like I have very high standards ...I just feel like I haven't met somebody that really matches my energy.”The latest twist in the ongoing Dart-Ayers saga comes from social media detectives who have linked scenes in Ayers’ TikTok vlog- ranging from the bathroom to the kitchen to Dart’s New York City apartment. Adding to the speculation, Ayers was seen wearing an oversized Giants T-shirt throughout her vlog, a detail that fans quickly interpreted as a playful nod to the quarterback. The two were also recently spotted enjoying a cozy dinner at Ristorante MV, dismissing previous rumors involving other celebrities.While neither Dart nor Ayers have made their relationship Instagram official, the signs seem hard to ignore. From public appearances with Dart’s mother to the subtle hints in her vlogs, Ayers appears comfortable and at ease in the Giants rookie’s world. Fans are left to wonder whether an official announcement, or even a marriage reveal is next. Until then, the pair remain one of the NFL’s most talked-about off-field duos, with every glimpse and post analyzed for clues about what might be a blossoming romance.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers’ mystery wife Brittani Sparks sparks fresh debate as no public sighting fuels marriage questions","New York Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart has been linked to social media influencer and model Marissa Ayers.

Aaron Rodgers mystery wife deepens as privacy becomes the real headline

Nearly six months after Aaron Rodgers quietly confirmed he is married, the story has taken an unusual turn. The wedding itself did not spark chaos. What followed did. In an age where every movement of a superstar is tracked, photographed, and dissected, Rodgers’ marriage has produced something almost unheard of in modern sports culture. Silence. No images. No public appearances. No social media traces. Not even a blurred background shot.Rodgers, now wearing Pittsburgh Steelers colors and savoring what looks like his final NFL chapter, seems more settled than ever. The quarterback who once invited controversy now appears content letting curiosity swirl without feeding it. As fans debate playoff odds and locker room chemistry, a far more personal mystery continues to grow quietly alongside his season.The intrigue intensified when Rodgers casually confirmed his marriage after reporters noticed a wedding band. Months later, he revealed his wife’s name as Britanni, offering rare insight during a conversation with NFL Network’s Kyle Brandt. He did not overshare. Instead, he framed marriage as a grounding force that reshaped his perspective.He stated: ""When you meet the right one and you're with the right one, your whole world changes in a second.""And to have that person that unconditionally loves you behind the scenes, there's no better feeling in the world, and I got the most incredible wife. I just really love her and I'm so thankful to have her by my side at the end.""When you have that stability and that rock behind you at the house, you feel like you can do anything.""Despite the warmth of his words, Britanni remains unseen. No sideline sightings. No family confirmations. No familiar faces stepping forward. Even insiders appear puzzled. One source summed it up bluntly: ""She’s like a phantom. We’ve never seen her at a practice, a game—nothing. It’s the strangest marriage announcement in recent sports history.""Rodgers has addressed the curiosity directly, pushing back against the culture that demands access. Speaking earlier on the Pat McAfee show, he explained why he chose a different path this time.He explained: ""It's a sick society, isn't it? I lived in the public eye for 20 years, I had public relationships. How did that work out? I had people leaking my home information and making up stories that we bought a house together. I had people calling the paparazzi, I had people posting my personal life on the internet. I didn't want any of that, didn't like any of that.""Now I'm with somebody who's private, who doesn't want to be in the public eye, didn't sign up to be a celebrity, doesn't want to be a part of it.""And because I do things in private because I want my personal life to be private, now I'm weird.""For a player long defined by unpredictability, this may be Rodgers’ most deliberate move yet. In choosing privacy over spectacle, he has created a mystery that refuses to fade, even without a single photograph.",Aaron Rodgers' marriage has produced something almost unheard of in modern sports culture.

Tennessee Titans star Jeffery Simmons burglary underscores growing risk for athletes



Sunday night unfolded in two sharply different worlds for Jeffery Simmons. While the Tennessee Titans fought under the lights in San Francisco, another battle was quietly playing out back home in Nashville. By the time the defensive tackle returned in the early hours of Monday morning, the sense of routine had been shattered. What should have been a simple walk back into his own space turned into a reminder of how exposed even elite athletes can be when duty pulls them away.The timing made it sting more. Simmons was thousands of miles away, doing his job, when strangers allegedly targeted his home. The intrusion left behind more than broken glass and missing items. It cut into the feeling of safety that every homeowner expects, famous or not. The shock came quickly, followed by anger, gratitude, and a resolve to speak out.According to Metro Nashville Police, the break-in happened around 7:30 p.m. local time on Sunday. Surveillance video later shared by Simmons showed two men approaching the back door before forcing their way inside and knocking down a camera. Police said video evidence showed six suspects involved and confirmed that “multiple items were taken” after they smashed a window to gain entry.Simmons reported the burglary after arriving home around 1 a.m. local time.Simmons did not stay silent. His message carried raw emotion and a deeper concern beyond stolen property. “What if any of my family members was in my house?? All that materialistic s–t you can have but this is crazy!” he wrote, later calling the suspects “f–king cowards.” His words struck a chord because they reflected fear that money cannot fix. No one was home at the time, a fact the Titans also confirmed, offering some relief in an otherwise unsettling moment.Law enforcement moved quickly. “Several components of the MNPD’s Investigative Services Bureau are actively working this case,” police said. The Titans echoed that effort, stating they were working closely with local authorities to recover the stolen items. Simmons made sure to acknowledge that response. “I want to extend my sincere appreciation to the Metro Nashville Police Department and the Titans’ security team for their professionalism and swift response,” Simmons said in a statement. “Their dedication to ensuring the safety of our entire Nashville community does not go unnoticed. I remain thankful for God’s protection and grace.”The incident fits a troubling pattern across professional sports. In recent seasons, high-profile players have faced similar crimes while traveling for games. Even so, Simmons still found a sliver of light on the field. Despite the Titans’ 37-24 loss to the 49ers, he recorded his ninth sack of the season and even caught a rare touchdown. It was a reminder that resilience often shows up where you least expect it, even after a night that left little to celebrate.Also Read: Alix Earle turns breakup tears into tropical glow-up, sends subtle message after Braxton Berrios split revelation","Tennessee Titans star Jeffery Simmons' home was burglarized on Sunday night.

Josh Allen’s smile says it all as he embraces fatherhood after Hailee Steinfeld’s pregnancy news



Buffalo’s comeback win in Foxborough delivered more than standings drama. It revealed a quarterback carrying two powerful motivations at once. On a cold Sunday night, Josh Allen stood in the glow of a 35-31 rally, fielding questions that had nothing to do with coverages or cadence. His answers were steady, warm, and deeply personal. The scoreboard mattered. So did the moment unfolding off the field, one that has quietly reshaped his life.The Bills kept control of their season by denying New England an AFC East clinch. Yet the scene afterward felt different. Allen was relaxed, almost glowing, as he spoke about a future far bigger than football. With a ring on his finger and a child on the way, the league’s reigning MVP sounded grounded, grateful, and ready for what comes next.Josh Allen did not hide how much the support meant to him after he and Hailee Steinfeld shared their news. He explained that the surprise had already settled in long before the public announcement. “I’ve known for a long time, so it’s not that crazy to me,” Allen said. What caught him off guard was the wave of messages, including notes from teammates and familiar faces. “But obviously the love I’ve received from teammates and friends — you know it’s a really cool, special moment in my life and my wife’s.”That balance between private joy and public attention has defined the couple’s approach. Steinfeld revealed the pregnancy through her Beau Society newsletter, framing it as part of a birthday reflection. “As I step into my 29th year as a softer, stronger version of myself, I want to appreciate some of my favorite moments from this year, both big and small,” she wrote. “29. This video…” The clip showed her baby bump and a sweater that read “mother,” simple and intimate by design.Their story has unfolded steadily. First photographed together in May 2023, they built a relationship away from noise. Allen proposed in Malibu last November, under roses beside the water. Friends close to them have long suggested this path felt natural. “They both are excited about starting a family and want that in the next few years,” an insider said. “They both share the same values when it comes to parenting and having kids. ”On the field, Allen remains relentless. He threw three touchdowns, ran with purpose, and tied Matthew Stafford for the most offensive scores in the league this season. Off it, he sounded just as fulfilled. He called Steinfeld “my favorite teammate,” a line that carried weight. With Cleveland up next and Buffalo surging, Allen appears to be leading with clarity, confidence, and a heart full of anticipation.Also Read: Alix Earle turns breakup tears into tropical glow-up, sends subtle message after Braxton Berrios split revelation",Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld are expecting their first child.

Alix Earle flaunts luxury vacation days after emotional Braxton Berrios breakup confession



Fresh off an emotional confession that had fans glued to their screens, Alix Earle wasted little time reclaiming her spark. The influencer, known for turning vulnerability into viral moments, shifted the narrative from heartbreak to healing almost overnight. One moment she was opening up about the end of a high-profile relationship. The next, she was stepping into sunshine, laughter, and a milestone birthday surrounded by friends who know her best.That fast pivot is part of why Earle continues to dominate social media. She does not linger in sadness for performance. Instead, she lets people see the mess, then the momentum. As her 25th birthday approached, the timing felt symbolic. A chapter closed quietly, and another opened with palm trees, ocean views, and the familiar confidence that has built her personal brand into a digital empire.Los Cabos became the backdrop for Earle’s reset. What started as a trip she nearly abandoned turned into a reminder of why she connects so deeply with her audience. Speaking candidly into her phone, she admitted, “I actually almost canceled this trip two days ago because I was feeling down in the dumps,” before adding, “And just wanted to lie in bed.But, it's going to be good because we're going to have some good girl time. ” The honesty landed because it felt real, not rehearsed.The celebration itself looked like something out of a dream. Birthday balloons waited at a luxury resort. A private massage room hinted at much-needed self-care. Laughter, swimsuits, and late-night moments with close friends filled the gaps where heartbreak once lived. Earle even acknowledged the emotional whiplash in her caption, writing, “Quite the turn around from crying on the couch for 12 hrs yesterday.”That contrast matters. Just days earlier, she had shared the words fans knew were hard for her to say: “I have been scared to say something about this because I feel like it just makes it more real. Braxton and I are no longer together.” She later expanded with grace and restraint, saying, “I love Braxton. He's my best friend... so it's been really difficult as we're trying to just go forward with this. It just kind of feels like we're on two different paths right now. .. We're on good terms. I don't want anyone to come after him or be mean to him.”Away from the breakup, Earle kept her spotlight warm with a festive photo drop that set social media buzzing. Posed in coordinated gray underwear, styled with cozy layers and holiday props, she leaned into confidence rather than commentary. Fans responded instantly, flooding her comments with praise and admiration.In the end, Earle’s story is less about moving on fast and more about moving forward honestly. Heartbreak did not derail her. It redirected her, straight into celebration, self-expression, and a birthday that marked not just another year older, but another step stronger.Also Read: Jameson Williams $27.7 Million deal, Net Worth in 2025, NFL Salary, Achievements, and More","Alix Earle flaunts luxury vacation days after emotional Braxton Berrios breakup confession.

Offset’s brief paternity jab referencing Stefon Diggs reopened Cardi B’s harassment concerns amid their breakup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/offsets-brief-paternity-jab-referencing-stefon-diggs-reopened-cardi-bs-harassment-concerns-amid-their-breakup/articleshow/125977864.cms,"Offset's brief Instagram post, implying paternity of Cardi B's newborn with Stefon Diggs, reignited online chaos and threats. Cardi B revealed the harassment escalated to real-world danger, highlighting how celebrity breakups in the digital age can spiral into lasting harm with just one upload.

Why Offset’s post struck a nerve beyond gossip and viral drama

Weeks after the dust initially settled, Offset’s brief but explosive Instagram post reopened one of the most volatile chapters in his split from Cardi B . The since-deleted message, posted shortly after news broke that Cardi had welcomed a baby boy with NFL star Stefon Diggs , quickly reignited online chaos, speculation, and renewed scrutiny of an already fractured family dynamic.While the post lasted only moments, the reaction was immediate and far-reaching. For Cardi, it was not just another social media jab, but a reminder of how public narratives can escalate into real-world threats. Looking back, the incident now stands as a flashpoint that exposed the darker side of celebrity breakups in the digital age.According to screenshots circulated online at the time, Offset posted “My kid lol” on his Instagram Stories, a remark widely interpreted as a provocative comment on the paternity of Cardi B’s newborn with Stefon Diggs. The message was quickly deleted, but not before igniting intense online speculation and harassment.Cardi, whose real name is Belcalis Almánzar, responded forcefully across platforms, making clear that the consequences went far beyond internet jokes. In a series of posts that were later removed, she wrote, “Y’all be thinking it’s so funny and it’s not.. it’s been over a year and I’m still being harassed and threatened to the point that I feel like my life in danger..it’s all fun and games until it’s too late.”She continued with a blunt plea that underscored her exhaustion: “Mf’ers do anything for attention and it could get real nasty with just one upload… LEAVE ME TF ALONE.”At the time, Cardi also addressed the situation through X Spaces, explaining how private harassment often spills into public attacks when ignored. “I’m really tired of getting harassed and when I get harassed privately and I ignore [it], that’s when I start getting harassed publicly,” she said. “I have every single receipt. If you wanna keep sending f–king blogs to harass me, like, I can’t take it anymore.”The controversy arrived against the backdrop of Cardi and Offset’s second divorce filing, ending nearly seven years of marriage. The former couple share three children, and Cardi has previously accused Offset of being largely absent while she covers the majority of their six-figure child-related expenses.In hindsight, the incident highlighted how celebrity feuds, especially those involving children, can quickly cross from spectacle into something far more serious. Offset’s post may have vanished, but its impact lingered, reinforcing Cardi B’s warning about how “just one upload” can spiral into lasting harm.Also Read: Cardi B goes all-in on Patriots fandom as Stefon Diggs’ playoff push turns her into an unlikely NFL diehard","Offset's brief but explosive Instagram post reopened one of the most volatile chapters in his split from Cardi B.

Her deliberate hosting of the team's annual Christmas luncheon showcased a shift from sideline supporter to an influential figure shaping off-field culture. Her refined presence and engagement signal a commitment to community and connection, extending the Mahomes brand beyond game-day narratives.

More than a hairstyle, a sign of responsibility within the Chiefs’ inner circle

Brittany Mahomes has long been visible around the Kansas City Chiefs, but her latest appearance suggested a shift from familiar sideline supporter to something more deliberate. When she hosted the team’s annual ladies’ Christmas luncheon, the moment felt less like a ceremonial obligation and more like a statement.From her polished styling to the way she carried the event, Mahomes appeared fully aware that her role within the Chiefs’ extended family is evolving. As Patrick Mahomes continues to define an era on the field, Brittany is increasingly shaping the off-field culture, one built on community, connection, and leadership rather than noise or controversy.At first glance, the attention surrounding Brittany Mahomes’ updated hairstyle and holiday look may seem superficial. But context matters. Hosting the Chiefs’ women-centered Christmas luncheon placed her at the heart of a long-standing organizational tradition, one designed to foster unity among wives, partners, and families during the most demanding stretch of the NFL season.Observers noted that her appearance felt carefully considered rather than trend-driven.The refined look, paired with a confident presence, reflected how seriously she approached the responsibility. This wasn’t just about showing up; it was about representing the franchise’s culture in a room that values stability, warmth, and shared experience.Over the years, Brittany Mahomes has built a reputation as outspoken, entrepreneurial, and deeply invested in Kansas City’s sports identity. From her involvement in women’s athletics to her business ventures and ownership stakes, she has consistently demonstrated an understanding of visibility and influence. That background helps explain why moments like this luncheon carry more weight than a typical holiday gathering.Within NFL circles, these events play a quiet but important role. They create support systems for families navigating the pressures of professional football, and leadership at these gatherings matters. By stepping into that space with intention, Brittany reinforced the idea that she isn’t merely adjacent to the organization, she’s helping shape its tone.As Patrick Mahomes’ status as the face of the Chiefs continues, the Mahomes brand has naturally expanded beyond game-day narratives. It now touches community engagement, organizational culture, and representation. Brittany’s growing presence reflects that expansion.Changing her hair may have sparked the headlines, but the deeper story is about purpose. Brittany Mahomes isn’t just attending Chiefs events anymore, she’s helping define them, and doing so with a level of seriousness that suggests this role is one she plans to carry forward.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes turns heads with an elegant holiday look at the Chiefs’ Christmas gathering",Brittany Mahomes is stepping into a more prominent leadership role within the Chiefs' extended family.

Instead of championship celebrations, the focus turned to family moments and reflections on an era's end, with retirement rumors now surrounding Travis Kelce. This unexpected turn closes a chapter of pop culture and football intertwined.

A dynasty unravels as Chiefs’ Super Bowl streak comes to an end

Taylor Swift has grown used to spending December with sold-out arenas, chart-topping milestones, and increasingly, NFL spotlights. But this year delivered a very different kind of headline as her birthday month collided with an unexpected football collapse. The Kansas City Chiefs’ shocking playoff elimination didn’t just end a season, it abruptly closed the league’s most watched crossover storyline.Swift, who has become a familiar presence in luxury suites and Super Bowl celebrations, watched her fiancé Travis Kelce and the Chiefs fall short in a way few predicted. Instead of planning another Super Bowl appearance, Swift found herself witnessing the symbolic end of an era, both for Kansas City’s dominance and for the pop culture phenomenon that followed it.The Chiefs’ 16–13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers marked more than just a defeat. It officially eliminated Kansas City from playoff contention for the first time since 2014, snapping a decade-long run of postseason relevance. For Swift, it also meant the end of her personal Super Bowl streak, one that had blended celebrity, music, and football into a cultural spectacle rarely seen in sports.Swift attended the game at Arrowhead Stadium, spending time in a VIP suite alongside Kylie Kelce and her daughters.Social media videos captured quieter, more intimate moments, including Swift holding one of the Kelce children, a sharp contrast to the glitz of previous championship runs. As one source told E! News, “She’s here with Kylie, the kids, and her family. It’s been more about relationships than football this time. ”On the field, however, the signs of decline were impossible to ignore. Inconsistency plagued Kansas City throughout the season, raising questions about roster depth, offensive rhythm, and the physical toll on veterans like Kelce. ESPN analyst Booger McFarland summed up the moment bluntly: “It’s the end of an era in many ways.”The loss has intensified speculation about Travis Kelce’s future, with retirement rumors beginning to surface after a season that fell well below the franchise’s standard. For Swift, the absence of another Super Bowl appearance closes a chapter that once featured celebrity-packed suites, global attention, and championship celebrations alongside Ice Spice, the Haim sisters, and Blake Lively.Instead of confetti and Lombardi dreams, this December offered reflection. Arrowhead became a backdrop for family moments rather than trophies, signaling a transition for both Kelce and the Chiefs and a reminder that even the NFL’s most powerful storylines can end abruptly.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s The End of an Era reveals the unseen role Travis Kelce played during the tour","The Kansas City Chiefs' 16–13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers marked the end of an era for the NFL's most watched crossover storyline.

Joe Burrow will play Thursday night against the Baltimore Ravens

The Cincinnati Bengals’ playoff dreams were dashed after a 24–0 home defeat to division rivals the Baltimore Ravens. After the loss officially knocked Cincinnati out of playoff contention, Bengals head coach Zac Taylor confirmed his decision about Thursday’s match.Taylor said that quarterback Joe Burrow will play Thursday night against the Baltimore Ravens. Burrow has been sidelined for the last nine games after suffering a turf toe injury in a September 14 match against Jacksonville.Burrow practiced for two days leading up to Sunday’s loss to the New England Patriots, but the team opted to start veteran Joe Flacco instead, which gave Burrow a bit more recovery time ahead of the short week.Cincinnati HC Zac Taylor said Burrow will play and start the rest of the regular season and was quite blunt about why he made the decision.“Because we want to win,” Taylor said.As per reports, the last time a Burrow-led team was shut out was in 2018 at LSU versus Alabama. Burrow created quite a stir with his recent comments. On Wednesday, the Bengals quarterback said he wanted to have fun while playing.Burrow said that must be a priority for him moving forward.""If I want to keep doing this, I have to have fun doing it,"" said Burrow. ""I've been through a lot and if it's not fun, then what am I doing it for? So that's the mindset I'm trying to bring to the table."" On a frigid Sunday in Cincinnati, the Bengals’ star quarterback finished 25-of-39 for 225 yards. He failed to throw a touchdown and was picked off twice.""I think this is one of the worst games that I've played,"" Burrow said.

Patrick Mahomes ACL update: MRI results bring encouraging news for 2025 season recovery





“As long as the surgery goes well, as expected, then I would expect a fairly quick recovery for him.”

“Don’t know why this had to happen. And not going to lie it hurts. But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again. Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I Will be back stronger than ever ⏰”

Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL in his left knee during Week 15, ending his 2025 season. While any ACL tear is serious, an MRI scan revealed no additional ligament damage, offering hope for a smoother recovery. Mahomes shared an emotional message on social media, thanking fans and teammates and promising: “I will be back stronger than ever.” Chiefs head coach Andy Reid echoed optimism, saying if surgery goes well, Mahomes could experience a relatively quick recovery.The injury occurred late in the game as Mahomes was moving in the pocket, a non-contact play that resulted in the ACL tear.

The final seconds in Phoenix brought noise, tension, and another chapter in a rivalry that refuses to cool. As the Lakers clung to a narrow margin, Dillon Brooks rose and buried a bold three over LeBron James . The Suns' bench erupted. So did Brooks. And with obvious reaction chaos followed with contact, and a swift whistle that changed the night’s tone.Within hours, debate flooded social feeds. Was there illegal contact on the shot? Did the moment tilt the outcome? The NBA’s Last Two-Minute Report arrived with clarity. Its ruling did more than explain a call. It closed the book on a moment that defined a wild finish.The league’s review supported the officials on the floor. According to the report, LeBron James contested from the side and would have avoided contact if not for Dillon Brooks extending his leg in an attempt to draw a foul. League insider Brett Siegel summarized the finding plainly.“The L2M report says this was the correct no call on LeBron James, as Dillon Brooks extended his legs to try and draw a foul. This play led to Dillon Brooks’ ejection as a result of a technical foul,” Brett Siegel wrote.The extension became the turning point.

The league acknowledged contact existed but ruled it marginal and initiated by the shooter. With the ruling upheld, the basket counted and the no-call stood.The report addressed two more moments that sealed the game. Devin Booker’s late foul on James during a three-point attempt was confirmed after review. James converted two of three free throws, swinging the lead back to Los Angeles with seconds remaining.Earlier, James stepped to the line for a technical free throw following Brooks’ ejection. He missed. Afterward, he explained his choice with honesty and calm.“S*it, I just walked up to the free throw line,” James said. Why wouldn’t I?”“I mean I’ve been okay with Luka [Doncic] taking it too, we’ve both been in pressure situations, but I just took it. Unfortunately, I missed it, but I made up for it,” James continued.He did exactly that. James later blocked Grayson Allen’s final attempt, preserving a 116-114 road win.

Poll What did you think about Shubman Gill's performance as captain in the first Test against England? Strong leadership Needs improvement Uncertain Not enough data yet

NEW DELHI: England registered a five-wicket win over India in the opening Test of the five-match series at Headingley, successfully chasing a challenging target of 371 on Tuesday. Ben Duckett led the charge with a brilliant 149, sealing a memorable victory for the hosts. For India, the match marked a tough beginning to Shubman Gill ’s tenure as Test captain, despite the team producing five individual centuries. The result drew sharp scrutiny from former captains Nasser Hussain and Ravi Shastri, who expressed concerns over Gill’s on-field leadership and tactical decisions.Former England captain Nasser Hussain compared Gill's presence and authority to his predecessors.""I thought I saw someone just finding his way, honestly. You've got to be very careful in the first Test match, the people he's taken over from, Kohli, and then Rohit Sharma. I thought he didn't quite have that on-field aura as the names I mentioned there. You look down on those two previous names, and you immediately see who was in charge of India,"" Hussain said on Sky Sports.Hussain also pointed out that Gill appeared to be sharing responsibilities with multiple senior players, which can sometimes happen when a new leader is still finding his feet.""I looked down from the press box, the commentary position, there were a lot of captains; it was a bit captaincy by committee, which can happen in your early days as a leader because you're still senior players like Rishabh Pant and KL Rahul want to try and help you out as much as possible. I thought he followed the ball a lot. I thought he was reactive as opposed to proactive,"" he said.He also questioned India’s bowling tactics during the match — particularly the use of Ravindra Jadeja — and suggested Gill could have been more assertive in guiding his senior spinner.""A word with Jadeja, maybe as a young captain, to go to such an experienced spinner, and go, you do know the rough is out there. Ravi Shastri and Mark Butcher are up there, going, show us where that ball is pitching, and it was pitching nowhere near the rough,"" Hussain explained.Hussain wrapped up his assessment with a comment on the final result and the lack of on-field communication around key bowling strategies.""Ravi was saying, a bit slow, a bit wide, bowl in the rough. I was surprised that not one of the senior players or captains went to Jadeja and said, Can we go a little bit wider. But Ravi's right, they lost the game for two things that he couldn't control,"" he added.As India look ahead to the second Test, questions are already being raised about Gill’s tactical instincts and whether he can grow into the leadership role as the series progresses.","England defeated India by five wickets in the first Test at Headingley.

Indian cricket team have now spent nearly three weeks in England, beginning at Beckhenham in London, moving on to Leeds, and are currently based in Birmingham. The squad faces scrutiny following a disappointing five-wicket defeat in the first Test at Headingley.Despite the pressure, the team’s atmosphere remains relaxed with seniors putting their arms around the youngsters as the team continues this transition period.On Thursday, players participated in a team bonding activity at an adventure park in Birmingham — a much-needed respite before resuming their rigorous schedule in the five-match Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.India are set to hit the training facilities again on Friday to start preparations for the second Test, from July 2, at Edgbaston. Their training plan includes three mandatory sessions, one optional session, and a rest day.However, the practice sessions scheduled for June 27 and 28 will be held behind closed doors without media access. BCCI explained that they're being held away from media scrutiny ""owing to operations and security perspectives from the venue and ECB.”India are due to rest on June 29 before hitting the nets again on June 30 with practice scheduled for 9:30am at Edgbaston. There would be a press conference on that day as well.The day after, on the eve of the second Test, there is an optional training session from 1:30pm local time with press conference pencilled in for 1:15pm.Trailing 0-1 in the series, India have a big task ahead of them as they go into the Edgaston Test. Historically, India have never won a Test at the venue in Birmingham. Out of eight Tests played at the venue, India have lost seven and drawn just once.Following the defeat at Headingley, India head coach Gautam Gambhir rejected the excuse of having a “young team,” stating:“Every defeat is bad. It’s not about the young team. It’s about the experience. We take pride in winning every game for our country. Being a young team is not an excuse. We represent 140 crore proud Indians, and we will give our best with no excuses.”In terms of team selection, the biggest dilemma for the management will be over Jasprit Bumrah. Having already declared that the seamer will play three Tests to manage his workload, it makes logical sense that he be rested for Edgbaston Test. The question then arises who comes in as a replacement for such a key member of the lineup.","Indian cricket team have now spent nearly three weeks in England, beginning at Beckhenham in London, moving on to Leeds, and are currently based in Birmingham.

Poll Should young players like Suryavanshi be given more opportunities to play at an international level? Yes, they bring fresh talent. No, they need more experience first.

A new star may be rising in Indian cricket, and he’s already making waves, both with the bat and his jersey. Fourteen-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi stole the spotlight in his India U19 debut against England U19 in a one-day game at the County Ground in Hove, smashing a breathtaking 48 off just 19 balls.But what truly set social media buzzing was the number on his back: 18, the iconic jersey worn by none other than Virat Kohli Fans were quick to notice the significance, with many seeing it as a symbolic passing of the torch.While comparisons to Kohli are still premature, Suryavanshi’s fearless approach and dazzling strokeplay certainly made a statement.Opening the innings, the young prodigy launched India’s chase of 175 with a flurry of boundaries and towering sixes. Partnering with captain Ayush Mhatre, the duo raced to 71 runs in just 7.3 overs.Suryavanshi’s innings included five sixes and three fours before he fell agonizingly short of a debut half-century, caught for 48 off 19.India U19 eventually cruised to a six-wicket win, with wicketkeeper-batter Abhigyan Kundu sealing the game with an unbeaten 45 and a match-winning six.Earlier, India’s bowlers had bundled out England for 174, with Kanishk Chouhan leading the attack with 3 for 20.Suryavanshi, who had spoken before the tour about his excitement to play in English conditions, has already delivered on his promise. ""I will get a good experience of playing in England. We will try to win a trophy from there as well,” he had said. Judging by his debut, he’s not just here to participate; he’s here to dominate.Wearing No. 18 comes with expectations, but Vaibhav Suryavanshi seems ready for the challenge.

NEW DELHI: Legendary India batter Sunil Gavaskar has taken a strong stand against the growing menace of fake quotes being circulated under his name across sports websites and social media platforms.In a video shared on his official Instagram handle, Gavaskar addressed the issue head-on, calling out the misattribution of comments he never made and urging fans to be cautious.“Over the last few months, it has come to my notice that a lot of sports websites and individual accounts have been attributing comments and quotes to me that I've never made,” Gavaskar said in the video. “I request everybody to verify, fact-check, and not to believe everything that they read, particularly coming from some of these individual accounts and sports websites.

Gavaskar’s actual commentary during the match, including a humorous reversal of his famous Melbourne jibe about Pant, was twisted by many platforms for engagement.","Legendary India batter Sunil Gavaskar has taken a strong stand against the growing menace of fake quotes being circulated under his name across sports websites and social media platforms.

Former England captain Nasser Hussain has weighed in on the return of Jofra Archer to England’s Test squad, calling it a ""gamble worth taking,"" but expressed caution about slotting him directly into the playing XI for the second Test against India at Edgbaston.Archer, who last played a Test in February 2021, has been named in the squad for the second Test starting July 2. The 30-year-old has battled persistent elbow and back injuries in recent years, and made his red-ball return earlier this week for Sussex, bowling 18 overs against Durham and picking up 1/32.Hussain, speaking to Sky Sports, acknowledged the emotional and physical toll of Archer’s comeback: ""Firstly, you have to say it's good news for Archer and England in that Jof must have been through so much with those [elbow and back injuries], the rehab, the pain, the mental torment of continually getting injured and making comebacks, so it's great to see him back in the squad… he hasn't played a Test match for four years. ""However, the former skipper cautioned against rushing Archer into the XI for Edgbaston. ""I think it's too much of a risk this week, but it may have gone so well - I don't know Jofra Archer's body - it may have gone so well that they say, 'we'll play you this week'. Then the problem is, who do you leave out?""Despite that, Hussain remained optimistic about the long-term value of Archer’s return. ""I do think it is a gamble worth taking, I just don't know if it's worth taking this week.I would do it a week after at Lord's.""England lead the five-match series 1-0 after their five-wicket win at Leeds.

India’s Bowlers Hit Top Gear in Birmingham Nets | Arshdeep, Akash Deep, Kuldeep Prep Hard

The Indian cricket team had their first training session in Birmingham on Friday and the side sweated it out for over three hours on a very pleasant morning. The sun was out but wasn't harsh as the steady breeze kept the conditions comfortable for training. Shubman Gill & Co. reached the venue around 9:15 am local time and all players were in attendance for the first taste of Birmingham conditions.Jasprit Bumrah travelled with the side but both him and Prasidh Krishna were absent from the net area. They did travel back with the side in the team bus but didn't make an appearance while the rest of their teammates were doing their share of batting and bowling. Bumrah and Prasidh didn't leave the stadium premises either.Mohammed Siraj's outing was restricted only with the bat only as the seamer worked a lot on the skill with batting coach Sitanshu Kotak. There were plenty of drills for leaving, ducking and playing deliveries and he spent close to 30 minutes before leaving the nets and joining his fellow seamers inside.All three featured in the Headingley Test and their absence from the bowling run-up could well be because of workload management for the long tour.It has now become the most trending keyword in the Indian camp and will be repeated often in the build-up to the second Test as there is no clarity yet on ace pacer Bumrah's participation in the fixture.It's a call which will be taken by the bowler, in consultation with the medical team, and could well open or shut doors for the few waiting in the wings. Akash Deep and Arshdeep Singh had long spells, both with bat and ball, and were closely watched by the support staff led by head coach Gautam Gambhir.Arshdeep has been spending a lot of time with the bowling coach Morne Morkel in the nets and the duo had worked overtime in Leeds to fine-tune left-arm seamer's run-up, back-foot landing and overall alignment. After almost every delivery, they exchange notes and remain constantly in each other's ears. From Leeds to Birmingham, it has been a similar story for Arshdeep in the nets as he continues to be chatty with Morkel and is always up for a battle with his Punjab teammate Gill in the nets.Gill turns to his old friend whenever he has to work on something specific and Arshdeep runs in full steam to test the right-hander in the nets. He maintains that intensity even during the long hit and is matched there by fellow seamer Akash Deep. If the Bumrah call is taken soon, one between Arshdeep and Akash will be drafted in the Playing XI as India would be in desperate need of a new ball bowler and the two have the required skill set to both control the shining red cherry, and make it talk.Still early days and a lot of time before the Test gets underway on July 2 but both seamers are hitting the right notes in the training and could make that decision very hard for the Indian team management. The answers to their will they, won't they lie in the outcome of Bumrah's will he or won't he?Akash in full flow can trouble the best in the business and Arshdeep could well be the surprise card up India's sleeve at the moment.","Team India had their first training session in Birmingham on Friday.

Vice-captain Smriti Mandhana expressed excitement about reuniting with Shafali Verma at the top of the order as India gear up for the five-match T20I series against England, starting Saturday. Backing the young opener’s return to international cricket, Mandhana said Shafali’s resurgence through domestic and WPL performances had been inspiring.“She’s had an amazing year. Once the setback had come, she went to domestic (cricket), scored bucket loads of runs, had an amazing WPL,” Mandhana said. “Of course, no one had any doubt about her talent, the way she came into the Indian team and dominated. She is a world-class player and always will be. For her to go back and do what she did in the last one year was amazing to watch. She deserves this comeback and I’m really excited to open with her again. ”India are coming off a 25-day preparation camp at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru, aimed at fine-tuning both white-ball and red-ball skills for this crucial stretch of the calendar, which includes the home ODI World Cup later this year.“It’s been a good 25 days of prep. We had batters and bowlers’ camp at NCA and that was also very targeted and specific keeping in mind this tour and the World Cup,” Mandhana noted during the pre-match press conference.With skipper Harmanpreet Kaur unwell, Mandhana addressed the media but confirmed the captain is likely to be available for the opening game.Having reached England early and trained for over a week, Mandhana said the team had valuable time to adapt to conditions. “A few good practice matches… especially for a lot of girls, it’s their first England tour. So it was important to come early.”Mandhana also highlighted how the T20Is will help build towards the 2025 T20 World Cup, also scheduled in England. “Five T20s in the same conditions just a year before the World Cup is perfect prep.

David Beckham is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery for a long-standing wrist injury, with wife Victoria Beckham offering fans a glimpse into his recovery.On Friday, Victoria took to Instagram Stories to post a photo of the 50-year-old football icon lying in a hospital bed, dressed in a hospital gown with his arm resting in a blue sling.Captioning the photo “Get well soon daddy” with a heart emoji, the former Spice Girl and fashion designer showed support for her husband, who sustained the original injury back in 2003 during an England match.Though no further medical details were shared, the injury appears to be related to the same wrist issue that had lingered since his playing days. Despite the discomfort, Beckham appeared in good spirits, smiling gently for the camera as he recovered post-surgery.Victoria also posted another touching image of David holding a friendship bracelet bearing the message “Get well soon” spelled out in colorful beads -- likely a sweet gesture from one of their four children: Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, or Harper.The hospital update comes just weeks after it was announced that Beckham would receive a knighthood from King Charles, officially becoming “Sir David Beckham.” Victoria marked the news with pride on Instagram, writing, “You’ve always been my knight in shining armour, but now it’s official.”The couple recently celebrated Father’s Day as well, with Victoria sharing throwback clips and photos of David with their children, calling him “the best daddy there is.”Married since 1999, David and Victoria Beckham continue to show that family remains at the center of their lives—even during unexpected hospital stays.","David Beckham is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery for a long- standing wrist injury.

Lazio have recalled Romano Floriani Mussolini to the club following his loan spell at Serie B side Juve Stabia. The 22-year-old right back is the great-grandson of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and son of Alessandra Mussolini, a former European MP for Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party.Mussolini initially joined Lazio in 2022 but did not make any appearances for the club. He spent the 2023-24 season on loan at Pescara, where he played 32 matches.At Juve Stabia, Mussolini established himself as a regular starter, making 37 appearances across all competitions. He contributed one goal and four assists during his time there. Despite Juve Stabia's interest in signing him permanently, Lazio opted to bring him back.Fascist fan groups have been present across Italian football, with Lazio's hardcore supporters maintaining ties to the extreme right since the 1970s. The club's historic ultras group, the 'Irriducibili', maintained friendly relations with similarly right-wing supporters at Inter and Verona.Verona's fan base has been involved in several controversial incidents.Their supporters have directed racist chants at Mario Balotelli and Franck Kessie, displayed swastikas in the stadium, and once arranged cars at a fan gathering to form a Nazi symbol in 2014.Some 20 years ago, former Verona club president Giambattista Pastorello stated he wouldn't sign a black player due to potential fan reaction.Nine years prior to that statement, Verona fans wearing Ku Klux Klan hoods hung an effigy of black Dutch player Maickel Ferrier from the stands. This incident occurred in protest of his potential signing, which was subsequently cancelled.","Lazio have recalled Romano Floriani Mussolini from Serie B side Juve Stabia.

Poll Do you think Kylian Mbappe's legal complaint against PSG is justified? Yes, absolutely No, it's unnecessary

What India are doing in Birmingham today, practice schedule, plan and more

France captain Kylian Mbappe has filed a legal complaint accusing former club Paris Saint-Germain of ""moral harassment"", according to the Paris prosecutor's office, which confirmed on Thursday that an investigation into the matter has been opened.The 26-year-old, who officially joined Real Madrid this summer after a prolific seven-year spell with PSG, is also in a legal tussle with the French champions over unpaid dues. Mbappe is seeking €55 million ($64.4 million) in unpaid wages and bonuses from the club.Mbappe’s latest grievance stems from how he was treated during the early stages of the 2023–24 season. According to the complaint, the striker was excluded from the first-team setup and made to train separately with players PSG were actively looking to offload — a move he believes was punitive after he declined to extend his contract with the club.The issue echoes broader concerns about contract-related coercion in football, a topic that has previously drawn attention from the French players' union, which lodged a formal complaint in a similar context last year.bappe was also omitted from PSG’s pre-season tour of Asia in 2023 and missed the opening match of the campaign. He was later reinstated to the first team following talks with the club’s hierarchy.The legal action adds another layer of tension to Mbappe’s departure from the French capital, where he scored 256 goals in 308 appearances and won numerous domestic titles. Notably, PSG lifted the UEFA Champions League for the first time in their history just weeks after his exit.The outcome of the investigation could have significant implications for both Mbappe’s claims and the club’s management practices, particularly in how high-profile players are treated during contract disputes.","Kylian Mbappe has filed a legal complaint accusing former club Paris Saint- Germain of ""moral harassment"", according to the Paris prosecutor's office.

Al Nassr has announced a two-year contract extension with Cristiano Ronaldo that will keep him at the Saudi Arabian club until 2027. The announcement came on Thursday after months of uncertainty about his future.The 40-year-old star confirmed his commitment in a video released by the team where he stated: ""Al Nassr forever.""Ronaldo's arrival in 2023 sparked a trend, leading many established players in the latter stages of their careers to move to Saudi Arabia.There was speculation about Ronaldo's future when he posted ""This chapter is over"" after Al Nassr finished third in the Saudi Pro League without winning any trophies.""Ronaldo's presence is a key factor in developing the Saudi league in the last two years and a half. He opens the door for elite and young players to come to Saudi Arabia,"" said a source from the Public Investment Fund (PIF) to AFP.The Saudi PIF, which manages the country's sovereign wealth fund, oversees several Pro League clubs including Al Nassr, Al Hilal, and Al Ahli.The news of Ronaldo's extension follows Brazilian star Neymar's departure from Al Hilal in January.Neymar's brief 18-month stint saw him play only seven matches while earning a reported $104 million annually.Despite being the league's top scorer with 25 goals, Ronaldo has yet to secure any Saudi or continental titles with Al Nassr. The team recently lost in the Asian Champions League semi-finals.The five-time Ballon d'Or winner had previously mentioned the possibility of ending his career with Al Nassr, a team popular among Saudi royals.Saudi Arabia has transformed its football landscape by investing heavily in European talent, beginning with Ronaldo's transfer in late 2022. The country is also set to host the 2034 World Cup.Saudi football enthusiasts have enjoyed watching prestigious players like Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, who collectively hold six Ballons d'Or, during regular league matches.Some observers have drawn parallels between the Saudi Pro League and the Chinese Super League, which previously attracted players with high salaries before facing financial difficulties.The Saudi Pro League's development aligns with the country's broader goals of becoming a tourism and business destination before global oil demand decreases.Ronaldo initially joined Al Nassr two years ago in a deal reportedly worth $250 million, marking a significant shift in his career path to Saudi Arabian football.","Cristiano Ronaldo has signed a two-year contract extension with Al Nassr.

Poll What are your thoughts on Switzerland's recent defeat to Luzern’s Under-15 boys team? It's embarrassing for the national team. It's just a training match, no big deal.

In a surprising turn of events ahead of UEFA Women's Euro 2025, host nation Switzerland suffered a humiliating 7-1 defeat to Luzern’s Under-15 boys team in a behind-closed-doors friendly. The match, which was played in three 30-minute thirds, was meant to be confidential but was leaked via social media by chance.According to Swiss outlet, a Luzern youth player shared clips from the match on TikTok, exposing the near unbelievable scoreline. The footage, which featured Juventus forward Alisha Lehmann and fellow international Alayah Pilgrim, reportedly garnered over 70,000 views before it was deleted. Lehmann is one of the most popular figures in women's football , boasting close to 17 million followers on Instagram.This is not the first time the Swiss women’s team has faced youth opposition during their Euro preparations. At their training camp, they previously lost 2-1 to FC Solothurn’s U-15 side but managed to edge past FC Biel’s U-15s with a 2-1 win.While the result may seem shocking to many, the Swiss Football Association has downplayed the result. Spokesperson Sven Micosse clarified the purpose of these matches, saying, “It’s not uncommon in women’s football to compete against junior teams. The goal is to bring a certain competitive element. The focus during this phase of preparation is on the physical aspect. Regardless of the result, these training matches are very similar to our international matches in terms of intensity and mileage. ”Switzerland, who automatically qualified for Euro 2025 as hosts, will next face Czechia in a formal friendly on Thursday before kicking off their tournament campaign against Norway on July 2.",Switzerland lost 7-1 to Luzern’s Under-15 boys team in a behind-closed-doors friendly.

Poll Do you believe the German soccer federation (DFB) should face harsher penalties for tax evasion? Yes, definitely No, the fine is sufficient

The German soccer federation has been convicted of tax evasion related to its successful 2006 World Cup bid.It brought an end of sorts on Wednesday to a 10-year process prompted by allegations that Germany used a slush fund to buy votes from FIFA executive committee members to be certain of hosting the tournament.A regional court in Frankfurt fined the federation, known by its German acronym DFB, 110,000 euros ($128,000) at the culmination of a nearly 16-month trial at the end of the investigation process. Prosecutors had been pushing for a larger fine after accusing the DFB of failing to pay approximately 2.7 million euros (now $3.1 million) in taxes related to its payment of 6.7 million euros ($7.8 million) to FIFA, world soccer's governing body, in April 2005. 'That payment settled a loan that Germany great Franz Beckenbauer, the head of the World Cup organizing committee, had accepted three years earlier from Robert Louis-Dreyfus, a former Adidas executive and then part-owner of the Infront marketing agency.The money was channeled through a Swiss law firm to a Qatari company belonging to Mohammed Bin Hammam, then a member of FIFA's Executive Committee. The exact purpose of the money was never determined.Theo Zwanziger, who was DFB president at the time, told Spiegel magazine in 2015, ""there was definitely a slush fund in the German World Cup bid."" He accused his successor, Wolfgang Niersbach, of lying about it. Both were on the World Cup organizing committee.The DFB concealed the repayment of the loan as a contribution toward a planned World Cup opening gala, which was later canceled, and falsely declared it a business expense a year later. Zwanziger, Niersbach, and DFB general secretary Horst R. Schmidt were originally charged in the trial. The proceedings against all three, who consistently denied the allegations of tax evasion, were eventually dropped upon payment of fines.""The court is certain without a doubt that the DFB evaded taxes and that those involved put up with it,"" presiding judge Eva-Marie Distler said Wednesday in comments reported by news agency dpa.The DFB was initially fined 130,000 euros ($151,000), but 20,000 euros was waived because of the ""procedural delays"" in the case. Distler was scathing in her criticism of the DFB, saying it presented a ""catastrophic image"" in its investigation of the affair and must bear the costs for the proceedings.""The clock ticks differently at the DFB. It generates astronomical legal fees. The responsible people externalize responsibility. No one has to face personal consequences,"" Distler said. ""No DFB representative participated in either the investigation or the trial. You have to ask, are they not taking the justice system seriously?""The DFB has one week to appeal the ruling.","The German soccer federation has been convicted of tax evasion related to its successful 2006 World Cup bid.

Training local marshals at Formula E circuits

Safety and technical knowledge are paramount in Formula E, where the sport involves handling some of the world’s fastest electric cars. Now, the FIA has given fans a behind-the-scenes look at how local marshals in each host country are trained before every Formula E race to ensure that operations run swiftly, efficiently, and to the highest standards.A video shared on the FIA Official Instagram page features Benoit Dupont, Head of Circuit Operations at FIA Formula E, offering a glimpse into the marshal training process at the Jakarta E-Prix.Speaking about the preparation in Jakarta this year, Dupont explains, “Before each Formula E race, we make sure that marshals are trained to the correct level to understand how to efficiently remove and recover a car. It's very important to have precise and fast operations. We've been in Indonesia before, but it was two years ago, so the goal here is to bring everyone back up to speed.”He adds that Formula E cars require a specific method of being lifted, particularly using a strap in a defined way. As a result, every post is trained individually to ensure marshals are fully up to date.Dupont also highlights the crucial role of the clerk of the course, who acts as a bridge between FIA officials and local marshals.He says, “Leaving a legacy is an important part of what the FIA brings to these races. There are international procedures that might not be followed at local races, so we ensure they meet the latest standards. That’s why we conduct training sessions like this,” he says. “The clerk of the course connects with the marshals, all the trackside personnel, and the recovery team. Since they communicate in their local language, the clerk ensures the communication line remains as efficient as possible.”Commenting on the video, one Formula E fan wrote, “Well done on showcasing these wonderful men and women who keep races going and clear up the mess after an OOPS moment from the drivers.”Also Read: Dan Ticktum shares unfiltered pictures and a note after Jakarta win, mentions losing F1 chance: “It wasn’t down to my attitude” The Jakarta E-Prix was a single-header this year, unlike its double-header format in the 2023 season. With just four more races remaining, the 2024–25 Formula E season is nearing its conclusion. Next up is the Berlin double-header on July 11–12, followed by the season finale in London on July 26–27.","FIA gives fans a behind-the-scenes look at how local marshals in each host country are trained before every Formula E race.

Nyck De Vries of Mahindra Racing has finally spoken up after his controversial race at the Jakarta E-Prix, where he received a ten-second time penalty for hitting Andretti’s Jake Dennis just moments before the race ended.

Dan Ticktum bares his feelings after maiden Formula E win



Dan Ticktum’s fans hail him for his unfiltered note



Dan Ticktum shared several memorable pictures from race day and the victory celebration after winning his maiden Formula E race in Jakarta. He penned a long note on his breakthrough win and, true to his unapologetic self, the Cupra Kiro driver didn’t mince words while opening his heart to fans on Instagram, along with a bunch of pictures. He reflected on the time when he was taking baby steps in Formula 1 but had to quit the field amid controversies.Dan Ticktum’s note comes just days after his first-ever Formula E win, following his victory at the Jakarta E-Prix and the traditional champagne bath on the podium. Starting from the very beginning, he wrote, “So there it is, first win in @fiaformulae in the books. I am immensely proud of what this great team of people have achieved this year. As some of you know, I was very close to being in F1 several years ago, but due to some political s****, it wasn’t meant to be. (For those too ignorant — no, it wasn’t down to my attitude). I was ready to give up racing, as at the time, my dream — to me at least — was over.”Moving to his switch to Formula E, he added, “However, an opportunity arose to take part in this exciting, relatively new championship, full of the best drivers in the world.@alexhuigusto and @russellohagan were instrumental in giving me this opportunity, and they, along with the rest of the team, have stuck by me during three very tough years being the least funded team on the grid. This year, with our new investment, it has enabled us to embark on an exciting new chapter with @porsche.motorsport and @cupra_official. The support from them has been immense.”He further wrote, “Long story short — I’m glad I didn’t give up and kept trying to pursue big things in motorsport. The @fiaformulae championship, and @jeffformulae in particular, have given me an environment where I can be me (mostly), and I can finally say that this year I’m enjoying my job again. Thank you to everyone who has supported me to this point. I know it’s only one race win, but it conjured up a lot of emotions for me personally, along with my father and family, who sacrificed so much. Plenty more to come, I hope. Onto Berlin!”Posting pictures of himself showing middle fingers to the camera, he added at the end, “P.S. Last 2 slides are for all those who doubted me.”IndyCar racer Louis Foster reacted to his post, saying, “Mega mega mega mate.” There was also a congratulatory message from the FIA Formula E page. Social media star Juca Vipari wrote, “YESSSSS BROTHER! The first of many!!”A fan also told Ticktum in the comments section, “Enjoy 1 million beers.” Another said, “A fight-or-flight mode and you chose the harder option with an EXTREMELY high reward — and it paid off! Congrats Dan! The first of many.” One more added, “So deserved. Thinking from the end of last year to where you and the team are now — seriously amazing work.

Sergio Aguero takes on the race track in a GEN3 Evo



All about GEN3 Evo Sessions

Manchester City star Sergio Aguero is one of the few chosen ones to get a chance to drive a Formula E car on a race track. The footballer had his own GEN3 Evo session, guided by none other than TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein. And Aguero nailed it by driving the electric race car like a pro, although he missed his engineer’s message to slow down to cool the tyres.Sergio Aguero got the opportunity to drive the Porsche 99X Electric GEN3 Evo Formula E car during Miami’s Evo Sessions on March 5 and 6. The video from his Evo session is pure entertainment, as he takes lap after lap, clearly enjoying the thrill of driving a race car.Earlier, the official handle of FIA Formula E shared a video from Sergio’s Evo Session on Instagram. It showed how the footballer missed the messages to slow down and continued at high speed despite the need to cool the tyres. He later asked them to raise the volume and eventually slowed down. Pascal Wehrlein was seen doing a great job coaching him over the radio.The 37-year-old told Formulae.com about the opportunity, “This is absolutely crazy: from footballer to racing driver in one of the fastest racing cars in the world.Every child is familiar with Porsche. The brand represents an iconic heritage, particularly in motorsport. I am absolutely delighted and would like to thank everyone involved for this unique opportunity.”Aguero and other participants underwent detailed training, which included simulator sessions, physical conditioning, driver coaching, hardware customization, and engineering briefings. It not only gave them the thrill of driving a race car but also gave viewers insight into the intricate world of Formula E — how a driver is trained and how the car is driven during a race. A complete documentary will be released later this year, showcasing the entire Evo Sessions footage.Sharing his reaction when Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds first presented the idea, he said, “The initial reaction when I presented the concept of ‘Evo Sessions’ to our teams and partners was, ‘This is wild!’ — which is when I immediately knew we had to bring it to life. We wanted to do something that has never been done before in motorsport; something that would give audiences and our fan base a unique perspective into the world of a Formula E driver, through the eyes of some of their favourite online personalities. ”He added, “Formula E is the fastest-growing motorsport in the world, and we have a clear target to hit half a billion fans by 2030. Through collaborating with some of the biggest names in popular culture right now, we’re able to open up Formula E to a whole new fanbase.”Also Read: Pascal Wehrlein on second place in Shanghai: “First time I felt like we were very competitive in the wet” Even the trainers are among the best Formula E drivers in the world.

Edoardo Mortara on his second place finish in Jakarta

Edoardo Mortara on being part of Mahindra Racing



Formula E Season 11 has turned out well for most teams, with new podium winners emerging in each round. At the recently held Jakarta E-Prix, it was Mahindra Racing’s Edoardo Mortara who secured his first podium of the season and the team’s second. While he’s happy to have claimed second place in Jakarta, he feels they could have achieved even more. His teammate, Nyck De Vries, was handed a ten-second time penalty for colliding with Jake Dennis as they approached the finish line.Edoardo Mortara joined Mahindra Racing in 2023 and had been chasing a podium finish ever since. Speaking after securing second place at the Jakarta E-Prix, the 38-year-old said, “I’m feeling kind of disappointed for the team because I think that more was possible for us, but actually happy for me. It’s been a long time coming, this podium, and if I look back, there were several occasions where, with a bit more luck, we could have changed it. ”Mortara found his podium opportunity when both his teammate Nyck De Vries and Andretti’s Jake Dennis were removed from contention after their collision. “But nevertheless, super happy with today’s race. I think we managed the strategy pretty well, especially with the first Attack Mode.We got a little bit unlucky with the Safety Car and Full Course Yellow because I think I could have made good use of my Attack Mode and passed Dan [Ticktum]. I was in front of him before the second Attack Mode. Nevertheless, super happy with second place and already looking forward to the next one,” he said.However, Mortara regrets that Jakarta isn't a double-header this year, unlike its last edition in 2023. ""Right from the start of the year, we're showing more and more performance, and this weekend we were really, really good. It's a shame that we only have one race here. I would have hoped to have a second one,"" he told FormulaE.com in an interview.Now running high on confidence, Mortara aims to continue the momentum in the upcoming Berlin double-header. He has achieved multiple podiums in Berlin in previous years, including one win.Reflecting on Mahindra Racing’s significant improvement this season, Mortara said, ""This year has been crucial for us. We brought some big updates in terms of software that helped us close a bit of the gap with the front-runners. I feel that now we have a package that is capable — not always, but on certain race weekends — of challenging at the front, and we probably had the best package in the race. Nevertheless, this result (Jakarta) shows great promise for the final race weekends, especially Berlin, which has always been a good one for me.

Nico Mueller feels for Andretti teammate Jake Dennis

Nico Mueller has expressed his happiness over securing his first podium of the season in Jakarta and hopes to carry the momentum into the remaining four Formula E races in Berlin and London. However, he also expressed regret for his teammate Jake Dennis, who had taken pole and was leading the race before being hit by Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries. While Dennis lost his chance to finish on the podium, Mueller went on to claim third place at the Jakarta E-Prix.Nico Mueller took to Instagram to share his joy at the podium finish. He posted a few pictures from the podium celebration and wrote, “PODIUM in Jakarta. That one tastes sweet after all the hard work and the good progress made coming into this weekend!

Some good moves that helped us go from P13 on the grid to P3. Very, very happy for the team. It could have been an even better day with Jake, who was obviously in great shape up there as well. But yeah, we’ll take that podium and hopefully carry the momentum into the last four races. ”When asked how he felt after the podium finish, Mueller had told the media, “Very good! We always had the race pace all season long. Qualifying has always been our Achilles’ heel, if you want to call it that. Today I felt like I had a car to get into the [qualifying] duels, but a slight mistake in these very dusty conditions cost me a lot.”Speaking about how he improved in the race, he added, “But then in the race, I managed to move up early and worked my way into the top eight. We were a bit lucky with the strategy, but I also think we executed really well. Whenever we had an opportunity to move forward, we took it, and we had good pace at the end. Very happy with how it all went — obviously super pleased for the whole team and my crew. They really deserve this podium, and I hope we can keep that momentum going into the last four races. ”Also Read: Nyck De Vries collides with Jake Dennis at Jakarta E-Prix; fans compare him to Max Verstappen Mueller is now 14th in the Formula E Driver Standings with 47 points, while his teammate Jake Dennis holds 10th place with 59 points.","Nico Mueller took to Instagram to share his joy at the podium finish at the Jakarta E-Prix.

Dan Ticktum won his first Formula E race in Jakarta on Saturday. But the result of the race could have been different had Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries not made contact with Andretti’s Jake Dennis. De Vries was issued a ten-second time penalty during the race, but it also killed the chances of either of them reaching the podium. In the end, it was the other Mahindra Racing driver, Edoardo Mortara, who took the second spot on the podium, with the other Andretti driver, Nico Mueller, finishing in third position.At Lap 20, the Mahindra Racing cars made a sandwich at the top, squeezing Dennis into second position, but De Vries’ contact with Dennis killed both their chances of reaching the podium.

The penalty, however, changed the order at the top.Jake Dennis highlighted the collision by sharing the video on his Instagram Stories and wrote, “Leading the race then get welcomed with this.” The Andretti driver was a contender for the winner’s trophy after securing pole. He had earned two podiums at the Jakarta double-header in 2023 and was very much in form to win another podium on Saturday.The video was shared on Formula E’s social media channels. A fan reacted to the video, “Thought that was Max Verstappen.” Another called it a “Classic Dutch move.” One more said, “Dutch drivers incapable of racing wheel to wheel with British drivers?

I've been in Formula E nearly four years now, but the whole time I’ve known this is what I can do. Now I’ve got a good car and I’m doing it. I’m very, very happy. I think a lot of people forgot I used to be quite handy on the F1 ladder back in the day, and now I’m just going to start proving it again. ”Praising his team, Cupra Kiro, Ticktum added, “The guys are pretty remarkable – in six, seven months, the rate of improvement we’ve had over this season is incredible. We started in quite a not-great place, and I was a little bit underwhelmed at the beginning of the season, but we chipped away.Since Miami, it’s been quite a steep upward trajectory, so I’m very, very proud of them. I’ve been with them since day one here, and to deliver that is very special for them – and a great feeling for me. ”Ticktum was part of the Red Bull Junior Team from 2017 to 2019. He was also a development driver at the Williams Driver Academy from 2020 to 2021, though his time there was often marked by controversy.After starting from fifth on the grid, Ticktum navigated a late Safety Car and two Full Course Yellows, having smartly made it past polesitter and net leader at the time, Jake Dennis, through the second round of Attack Mode activations on Lap 29.Also Read: Jakarta E-Prix 2025 results: Dan Ticktum registers first Formula E career win, Edoardo Mortara and Nico Mueller join him on podium From there, Ticktum had Edoardo Mortara’s Mahindra to fend off over the final four racing laps in a sprint finish.

'I had so much hate'

London: Carlos Alcaraz warned his Wimbledon rivals that he ""feels great"" on grass after the world number two defied his own expectations by winning the Queen's Club title for a second time.Alcaraz battled to a bruising 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 6-2 victory over Czech world number 30 Jiri Lehecka in the final of the Wimbledon warm-up event on Sunday.The 22-year-old has extended his career-best winning streak to 18 matches, putting him in the perfect position to defend his Wimbledon title.Alcaraz has won the French Open, the Rome Masters and Queen's during his blistering run.But the five-time Grand Slam champion had arrived in west London concerned about his ability to make the tricky transition from the clay-court season to the unique demands of the brief grass campaign.Underling the difficulty of the task, Alcaraz is the first player to win Roland Garros and Queen's back to back since Rafael Nadal in 2008.""I'm going to say it's really complicated, the switch from clay to grass in just few days, because that's the time I had before the tournament began, just two days of practising,"" Alcaraz said.""So I came here with no expectations at all. I came here with a goal to play two or three matches, try to feel great on grass, and give myself the feedback of what I have to improve.""But I got used to the grass really quick, and I'm really proud about it. My goal was complete, and I'm not talking about lifting the trophy or making the final.""It was just to feel great, to feel really comfortable on grass once again.""For a player raised on the clay courts of Spain, Alcaraz has become a formidable force on the lawns of Queen's and Wimbledon.He is only the third Spanish man to win four grass-court tournaments after Nadal and Feliciano Lopez.""It's great to be with Rafa and Feli, such great players from our country,"" he said.""Hopefully now I will not stop here. Hopefully keep going.""A key part of Alcaraz's winning formula is his ability to switch off from tennis after tournaments to ensure he is refreshed when he returns to the court.The former world number one partied in Ibiza after his epic five-set French Open final triumph against Jannik Sinner earlier this month.He won't have time for a similar holiday before Wimbledon starts on June 30, but he plans to relax as much as possible in London before focusing on his bid for a third successive All England Club crown.""A lot of people ask me the same question: Are you going to go back to Ibiza? I wish! As I said, I'm a player who needs days off to enjoy, days for myself to spend with my friends, with my family, just to turn off my mind,"" he said.""I can't go back home. I'm going to stay here in London, hopefully enjoy it a little bit, then be back and preparing Wimbledon the best way possible.""While Sinner crashed out in the Halle second round against Alexander Bublik this week, Alcaraz's success at Queen's moved his record since losing to David Goffin at the Miami Masters in March to a formidable 27-1.Alcaraz believes that defeat was a transformative moment in his season.""I had so much hate when I lost in Miami. A lot of people started to say 'What's going on with this guy. He just lost in the first round, and he didn't practice, he didn't go to the court',"" Alcaraz said.""I think that was the key, just to have five, six days off, not grabbing a racquet, not stepping on the court. Just go to vacation with my family, to turn off my mind, to think what should I have done better?""I just got the joy back. I started to enjoy playing tennis again, realising what is the most important thing for me.""","Carlos Alcaraz wins Queen's Club title for second time. Beats Jiri Lehecka 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 6-2 in the final on Sunday. World number two extends his winning streak to 18 matches. He is the first player to win Roland Garros and Queen's back to back since Rafael Nadal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122014918,imgsize-66630,width-400,resizemode-4/122014918.jpg"

- Ruthless Alcaraz -

L ONDON: Carlos Alcaraz clinched his second Queen's Club title as the world number two warmed up for Wimbledon with a 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 6-2 win against Jiri Lehecka in Sunday's final. Alcaraz blasted 33 winners and 18 aces to subdue the gritty Czech world number 30 in two hours and 10 minutes in west London.Having won titles on clay at the French Open, Rome and Monte Carlo, as well as the hard courts of Rotterdam, Alcaraz has now collected five trophies in 2025.The 22-year-old has not lost since the Barcelona final against Holger Rune on April 20 and is enjoying the longest winning streak of his career with 18 successive victories.Top seeded Alcaraz is just the second Spanish man to win Queen's twice after Feliciano Lopez, who lifted the trophy in 2017 and 2019.""I'm happy to lift this trophy once again. It's a nightmare to play against Jiri, but it's been an incredible week,"" Alcaraz said.""I came without expectations. I just wanted to play good tennis and get used to the grass.""It's really special playing here every year. I can't wait to come back next year.""For a player raised on the clay courts of Spain, Alcaraz has developed into a formidable force on grass.The former world number one signalled his emergence on the surface by winning Queen's in 2023.He clinched the Wimbledon title for the first time just weeks later and defended his All England Club crown last year.Alcaraz, who has an 11-1 career record at Queen's, will start his bid for a third successive Wimbledon title on June 30.After his semi-final win over Roberto Bautista Agut on Saturday, Alcaraz fired an ominous message to his Wimbledon rivals, warning that his ""grass-court mode"" had been activated.And on the evidence of his relentless display against the obdurate Lehecka, he is in no mood to surrender his All England Club crown.Playing his first tournament since his epic French Open victory against Jannik Sinner two weeks ago, Alcaraz's march to the Queen's showpiece made it five consecutive finals for the Spaniard.In contrast, Lehecka was playing in his first grass-court final after a shock win against British star Jack Draper in the last four.The 23-year-old was the first Czech in the Queen's final since Ivan Lendl in 1990.Lehecka had come from a set down to stun Alcaraz in the Qatar Open quarter-finals in February.But there would be no repeat of that upset on the lawns of Barons Court.In his second Queen's final, Alcaraz had an early chance to break in the fifth game of the first set.Lehecka thundered down an ace to get out of trouble of that occasion.But the five-time Grand Slam champion matched Lehecka's serve blow for blow, dropping just one point in his first four service games.Alcaraz's piercing ground-strokes increased the pressure and Lehecka finally cracked in the the 11th game when an badly-timed double-fault gifted the first break to the Spaniard.Alcaraz served out the set in typically ruthless fashion, but Lehecka refused to surrender without a fight.A tight second set stayed on serve all the way through to the tie-break and, for once, Alcaraz stumbled with a key double-fault, allowing Lehecka to level the match.Alcaraz was unfazed, breaking for a 3-1 lead in the deciding set when Lehecka netted an off-balance forehand.Alcaraz had the finish line in sight and he wrapped up his latest title triumph with a flurry of searing winners.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Jiri Lehecka 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 6-2 to win Queen's Club title. World number two is just the second Spanish man to win the tournament twice. The 22-year-old has not lost since the Barcelona final on April 20. He is enjoying the longest winning streak of his career with 18 successive victories.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122008446,imgsize-62112,width-400,resizemode-4/122008446.jpg"

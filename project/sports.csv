Former West Indies cricketer Ian Bishop has shared his insights on whether Indian cricket veterans Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli could feature in the 2027 ICC ODI World Cup, while also commenting on Shubman Gill 's captaincy future. Bishop emphasized that the veterans' participation would depend on their motivation, fitness, and form, while suggesting that Gill requires time to develop as a captain despite showing promise.Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are set to return to international cricket in the upcoming Australia tour, having been selected for India's ODI squad following their Champions Trophy victory earlier this year.The future of both players in the 2027 World Cup remains a subject of discussion, considering Rohit would be 40 and Kohli 39 by then.""That's their decision. I can't answer that for Rohit or for Virat or for the BCCI. It depends on what their determination and skill are like. They've been fine so far,"" Bishop told PTI Videos.The discussion also centered around Shubman Gill's recent appointment as captain, following his leadership in India's 2-0 Test series victory against the West Indies.""He'll be fine. Those two guys will help him along the way. He will grow in the job,"" Bishop told PTI Videos. ""He's nowhere near the finished article.People have to give him that chance to grow as a captain, and as a batsman, he will grow as well.""Bishop highlighted the importance of having experienced players like Rohit and Kohli to guide Gill through his captaincy journey.""He has the temperament and the skill to lead, but the growth in captaincy and tactics is something that will take a couple of seasons to grow into. I'm sure he'll get help from the two veterans,"" Bishop elaborated.The former West Indies pacer also provided his analysis of the recent Test series between India and West Indies.Despite India's dominant performance, Bishop identified positive developments for the West Indies team.""From a West Indian perspective, it was great to see a few of the batters spending time at the crease. The trust they showed in the pitch was excellent,"" he remarked, specifically mentioning performances by Shai Hope , John Campbell, and Justin Greaves, along with spinner Jomel Warrican.Bishop concluded his observations about the West Indies team saying, ""It's not that they've arrived, but they've put some building blocks in place.""Both Rohit and Kohli's experience and leadership will be crucial in mentoring the next generation of Indian cricket leaders, particularly as Gill develops in his new role as captain.The upcoming ODI series in Australia will provide an opportunity for this leadership transition to unfold, with the veterans supporting Gill's development while maintaining their own performance standards.","Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are set to return to international cricket in the upcoming Australia tour.

Former England cricket star Stuart Broad has criticized the current Australian cricket team ahead of the upcoming Ashes series, describing them as the weakest Australian side since 2010, while responding to Australian opener David Warner 's prediction of a 4-0 victory for Australia and his comments about England playing for a ""moral victory.""Broad, who recently retired after the 2023 Ashes series and now works as a TV commentator, has highlighted concerns about Australia's top-order batting and the unsettled nature of their lineup.The former England pacer pointed to Australian captain Pat Cummins ' uncertain availability for the opening Test in Perth on November 21 as a significant concern for the home team.""You wouldn't be outlandish in thinking – it's actually not an opinion, it's a fact – it's probably the worst Australian team since 2010 when England last won, and it's the best English team since 2010,"" Broad told the BBC's For the Love of Cricket podcast. ""So those things match up to the fact it's going to be a brilliant Ashes series.""Broad, who was part of England's successful 2010-2011 Ashes campaign in Australia where they won 3-1 under Andrew Strauss 's leadership, gained prominence in the series with his remarkable bowling performance of 8-15 at Trent Bridge in 2015.His relationship with Australian crowds became contentious after the 2013 incident where he refused to walk after edging a ball to slip, earning him the status of an Ashes villain.Broad acknowledged the historical difficulty of winning in Australia but emphasized the current vulnerabilities in the Australian team, particularly with uncertainty surrounding players like Marnus Labuschagne, Sam Konstas, and Beau Webster.""It's very, very difficult to win in Australia as an England side or any side – it just is,"" Broad said. ""Australia have to be massive favourites. The question really was 'which team's under the most pressure?' Well, Australia are under the most pressure because they're expected to win. They're brilliant at home.""The former England bowler specifically addressed the leadership and team composition concerns facing Australia.""But they've got question marks over their team and question marks over the captain (Pat Cummins),"" Broad stated. ""Australia have been so consistent for a long period of time that you just knew who was going to open the batting, who was going to bat where, what bowlers there were – and they don't have that.""Broad reinforced his assessment of the current Australian team's standing in comparison to previous sides.""I don't think anyone could argue that it's their weakest team since 2010 … it's just a fact,"" he concluded.The comments from both Broad and Warner have intensified the pre-series dialogue between the two cricket nations, setting the stage for the opening Test in Perth on November 21.These exchanges continue the traditional pre-Ashes verbal sparring between England and Australia, adding another chapter to the historic cricket rivalry between the two nations.The upcoming series will test both Broad's assessment of the Australian team's perceived weaknesses and Warner's confident prediction of a dominant home victory.","Former England bowler Stuart Broad has criticized the current Australian cricket team ahead of the upcoming Ashes series.

NEW DELHI: Amid cheers and flashing mobile phones, fans flocked to Delhi airport on Tuesday, hoping for a selfie with Rohit Sharma as the star cricketer arrived ahead of India’s upcoming tour of Australia.

This series will mark his first appearance since India’s Champions Trophy 2025 victory in March, where he was named Player of the Match for scoring 76 off 83 balls in the final. It will also be his first outing in the blue jersey since Shubman Gill assumed ODI captaincy.The 38-year-old recently completed an intensive two-hour training session at Shivaji Park with former Mumbai teammate Abhishek Nayar as part of his preparations for the Australia tour. Social media was abuzz with visuals of fans gathering to watch Rohit practice. During the session, he showcased his signature pull and cut shots against pace bowling, along with aggressive inside-out drives. He also focused on sweep and slog sweep shots while practicing against spin bowling.Reports circulated claiming Rohit accidentally hit his Lamborghini during the practice session, though these remain unverified. The training, held at All Heart Cricket Academy, included Mumbai cricketer Angkrish Raghuvanshi and several local players, with Rohit participating in two batting net sessions.Rohit’s last appearance for India was in the Champions Trophy final against New Zealand in February, where he led the team to their second consecutive ICC title following the T20 World Cup win in the Americas in 2024. After Shubman Gill became India’s ODI captain, Rohit is now focused on the three-match series against Australia, starting October 19 in Perth, aiming to make a strong comeback in the international arena.",Rohit Sharma arrives in Delhi ahead of three-match ODI series against Australia.

Demerit points/sanctions to be carried forward irrespective of formats

NEW DELHI: As the Ranji Trophy season gets underway, the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) has updated its playing conditions to cover the loopholes in the serious injury replacements provision. According to the new document shared with the state associations, a player will not be eligible to take the field for a week from the day he/she is replaced for a serious injury and will need to take clearance from BCCI’s centre of excellence (COE).The board has introduced the ‘serious injury replacement’ provision in playing conditions as a part of the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) pilot project before incorporating it in international cricket’s playing conditions.“If a player is replaced for serious injury during the match, the concerned player will have to stand down for a minimum period of seven days from the time the serious injury replacement was permitted. After the completion of the minimum stand down days the concerned player will be required to report to BCCI – COE for further assessment of his fitness. The specialist panel at the BCCI COE will assess his / her fitness and based on the specialist report the player will be cleared for any future participation in BCCI matches,” the BCCI notification to state associations read.As per the updated playing conditions, if a player gets injured on Day One of the match scheduled from Oct 15-18 and is taken to the hospital in the evening for a scan before an injury replacement was requested and permitted on Day Two (Oct 16), Oct 17 will be the first day of the minimum stand down days.There have been raging debates around allowing a replacement for serious injuries. The debate gathered steam when Rishabh Pant walked out to bat in the Manchester Test this July with a broken foot followed by Chris Woakes being unable to bowl in the second innings of the final Test of the series at Oval. While a section of former cricketers raised the need to have such replacements, few were concerned about teams misusing the provision. TOI understands that the ICC will take stock of how it is working out in domestic tournaments in the coming chief executives’ meeting in Nov.The BCCI also clarified that a player’s demerit points and sanction will be applicable in the next match his team is slated to play irrespective of the format. For example, if a player cops a suspension or demerit points in the last Ranji Trophy match of the team, he/she will have to stand down from the next game his/her team plays even if it’s in T20 or One-day format.",The Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) has updated its playing conditions to cover the loopholes in the serious injury replacements provision.

Three decades ago, Amay Khurasiya was buried in books on reasoning and management, preparing for an entry into a premier B-school in Indore. With a steady hand and a sharp mind, a corporate high-flyer’s life seemed inevitable.But destiny bowled a googly.“I was serious about cricket ,” he says with a smile. “It pulls you back in ways you don’t expect,” he tells TOI.Instead of fielding boardroom queries, Khurasiya found himself facing fast bowlers — first as a stylish middle-order batter for India in the late 1990s, and now as the architect behind Kerala’s rise in domestic cricket.“I never sat for the civil services exam,” he clarifies, addressing long-standing myths.“I was a gazetted officer, yes, but I took VRS in 2014. I was a superintendent in Customs and Excise.”His wife Kirty, he points out, is the real civil servant in the family.Khurasiya’s cricketing credentials remain evergreen — a 57 off 45 balls against Sri Lanka in 1999 on his ODI debut.But it’s his coaching acumen that’s drawing attention now. Under his calm but driven leadership, Kerala reached their first-ever Ranji Trophy final last season.“Last year was the result of a system in place — structured camps, focused development, and a fiercely cohesive unit. It all came together,” he says.Beating his home state, Madhya Pradesh, was a personal and professional turning point. “That match was emotional. It validated everything we’d been building.”This season, the hunger remains. Three off-season camps helped identify emerging talent while reinforcing the team’s core. “There’s still that fire. We’ve tasted the final …now we want the title.”Off the field, Khurasiya has embraced Kerala wholeheartedly — picking up Malayalam (“Entha visheshum?” is his go-to icebreaker), including the locker-room slang. “I know all the cuss words now,” he jokes.Even the food has grown on him. A lifelong vegetarian, he now swears by avial and thoran.For Khurasiya, learning a language sharpens his neurons. Coaching Kerala gives him purpose.“We’re not underdogs anymore,” he says. “We’ve shown we can make the final. This time, we’re here to win it,” he adds.From cricket fields to customs halls and back again, Khurasiya’s journey is anything but conventional. But he’s exactly where he belongs: at the heart of Kerala’s cricketing renaissance.","Amay Khurasiya is the architect behind Kerala's rise in domestic cricket.

People have to give him that chance to grow as a captain, and as a batsman, he will grow as well.""Bishop highlighted how Rohit and Kohli's experience will benefit Gill in leadership responsibilities and pressure management.""He has the temperament and the skill to lead, but the growth in captaincy and tactics is something that will take a couple of seasons to grow into. I'm sure he'll get help from the two veterans,"" he added.When questioned about Rohit and Kohli's potential participation in the 2027 World Cup, Bishop emphasized it would depend on their personal choices.""That's their decision. I can't answer that for Rohit or for Virat or for the BCCI.It depends on what their determination and skill is like. They've been fine so far,"" he continued.India demonstrated their superiority by winning the home Test series against West Indies convincingly.Bishop noted positive developments in the West Indies team, particularly in batting and bowling performances from several players, adding, ""From a West Indian perspective, it was great to see a few of the batters spending time at the crease.

England secured their spot in the 2026 World Cup with a commanding 5-0 victory over Latvia, while Portugal's qualification was delayed after a 2-2 draw with Hungary on Tuesday. The matches were marked by notable performances from Harry Kane and Cristiano Ronaldo , while pro-Palestinian demonstrations preceded Italy's crucial win against Israel.England maintained their perfect record in Group K, securing their sixth consecutive win in Riga. The victory gave them an unassailable seven-point lead at the top of the group with 18 points, confirming their World Cup qualification with two games remaining.Anthony Gordon initiated the scoring for England before Harry Kane added two goals, including a penalty, to make it 3-0 by halftime. Kane's performance continued his impressive run, bringing his total to 21 goals in 13 games this season for club and country.""It comes rarely that you qualify for a World Cup, so the mood is very, very good,"" said England manager Thomas Tuchel.The match concluded with an own goal by Maksims Tonisevs and a fifth goal from Eberechi Eze, cementing England's dominant performance.In Group F, Portugal's qualification celebrations were put on hold after a dramatic 2-2 draw with Hungary in Lisbon. Hungary took the lead through Attila Szalai's header before Ronaldo equalized and later scored again, extending his international scoring record to 143 goals in 225 appearances.Ronaldo's performance also earned him the record for most goals in World Cup qualifying with 41, surpassing Guatemala's Carlos Ruiz's previous record of 39. However, Hungary's Dominik Szoboszlai scored in injury time to secure the draw.Italy's match against Israel in Udine was preceded by protests, with pro-Palestinian demonstrators clashing with police while thousands peacefully marched through the city. The demonstrations were sparked by concerns over hosting the match amid Israel's military offensive in Gaza.The Azzurri secured a 3-0 victory in the Group I fixture, with Mateo Retegui scoring twice and Gianluca Mancini adding a third. The win ensures Italy will finish at least second in the group, positioning them three points behind leaders Norway with two games remaining.Spain continued their strong qualifying campaign in Group E, defeating Bulgaria 4-0 in Valladolid. Mikel Merino scored two headers, bringing his qualifying tally to six goals in four games, while an own goal by Atanas Chernev and a penalty from Mikel Oyarzabal completed the scoring.""We don't have much further to go to get to the World Cup, but it's not done yet...

Khalid Jamil promises 'attacking mode' as India take on Singapore in AFC Asian Cup 2027 qualifiers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/khalid-jamil-promises-attacking-mode-as-india-take-on-singapore-in-afc-asian-cup-2027-qualifiers/articleshow/124546071.cms,"Indian football team (X)

Margao:

At the pre-match media interaction, India coach Khalid Jamil used the word “positive” five times, not surprising given his known approach to games. But, quite uncharacteristically, he referenced activating an “attacking mode” right from the start three times.That’s probably the biggest cue of what to expect from India when they face Singapore in a must-win game of the AFC Asian Cup 2027 final round qualifiers at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, on Tuesday.India drew 1-1 against Singapore with a last-gasp goal away last week. With five points between Jamil’s side and leaders Hong Kong in the group at the halfway stage, the hosts are left with no option but to attack.“It’s our home game. We have to be in an attacking mode from the start,” Jamil said while responding to a query from TOI during the pre-match media interaction. Against Singapore last week, India fought bravely for a 1-1 draw, despite Sandesh Jhingan being sent off two minutes into the second half.Jamil now wants his side to carry the same spirit forward as the teams face off again in Goa. The last time Singapore played here in 2004, they lost by a solitary goal.India started their campaign with a goalless draw against Bangladesh at home in March and then suffered a 0-1 loss against Hong Kong, both under Manolo Marquez.Last week’s draw means India have two points, with Hong Kong (7) on top and Singapore next on five.With Jhingan suspended, Jamil had to summon left-back Subhasish Bose to fill the void in defence, while Lalengmawia Ralte (Apuia) has been drafted in place of Macarton Nickson, who was handed his national team debut just last week. Both were left out for the away clash.“We required them, especially Subhasish, because we don’t have an extra left-back. Sandesh is out and Apuia I think deserves to be back again because of his experience. I have seen his (recent) game and he was good, so we thought this is the right time to use the players,” said Jamil.Only the top team qualifies for Saudi Arabia 2027, so it won’t be easy for India, who need to win all their remaining three games to give themselves a chance of qualifying. If they turn it around, it will be for a record three editions in a row.Singapore are also chasing their own piece of history, having never played at the AFC Asian Cup before. They were on course for three points after a dominating performance at home against India, only to shoot themselves in the foot in the final minute of regulation time.","India face Singapore in a must-win game of the AFC Asian Cup 2027 final round qualifiers at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, on Tuesday.

Switzerland forced to wait

Injury-hit France were held to a 2-2 draw by Iceland in 2026 World Cup qualifying on Monday, while Germany won in Northern Ireland with a Nick Woltemade goal and Belgium beat Wales to stand on the brink of a place at next year's finals.France, World Cup winners in 2018 and runners-up in 2022, were without a host of players in Reykjavik including captain Kylian Mbappe and Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele, both out injured.They fell behind to a Victor Palsson goal late in the first half, but Christopher Nkunku equalised just after the hour mark.Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta then gave Les Bleus the lead midway through the second half, getting his first senior international goal on his first start.However, Iceland were back level almost from the restart as Kristian Hlynsson of FC Twente ran through unchallenged to make it 2-2.France could have clinched qualification for next year's tournament in North America with a win in Reykjavik combined with Ukraine failing to beat Azerbaijan at the same time.But while they were dropping points, Ukraine were beating Azerbaijan 2-1 in the Polish city of Krakow -- Oleksiy Hutsuliak and Ruslan Malinovskiy scored for Ukraine either side of a Vitaliy Mykolenko own goal.France are nevertheless three points clear at the top of Group D with two games remaining next month, and a win at home to second-placed Ukraine in Paris will wrap up top spot.""We totally controlled the game. Iceland had two shots on target and scored two goals,"" France coach Didier Deschamps told TFI.""But we have another point on the board and next month will be decisive.""Germany have now recorded three consecutive victories in Group A after beginning their campaign with a defeat in Slovakia last month.Newcastle United forward Woltemade headed in the only goal of the game as Germany beat Northern Ireland 1-0 in Belfast, and Julian Nagelsmann's team are top of the group with nine points.""It was a very important three points for us,"" Woltemade told Germany's RTL, adding that ""in this atmosphere and in a bit of an ugly game, you have to win and we did well"".Slovakia sit second only on goal difference as they defeated Luxembourg 2-0 at home, Adam Obert and Ivan Schranz scoring the goals in the second half.The 12 group winners in European qualifying will go to the World Cup, with runners-up continuing on to play-offs set for next March -- the meeting between Germany and Slovakia in Leipzig next month will therefore be decisive.Belgium have almost qualified from Group J after Kevin De Bruyne converted two penalties in a 4-2 win over Wales in Cardiff.Joe Rodon had given Wales an early lead but De Bruyne's spot-kick double came either side of a Thomas Meunier goal.Nathan Broadhead pulled it back to 3-2, only for Leandro Trossard of Arsenal to seal Belgium's victory at the death.Rudi Garcia's Red Devils -- who beat Wales 4-3 at home in June -- now know one win from their two games next month away to Kazakhstan and at home to Liechtenstein will clinch top spot.Meanwhile, Wales must try to catch second-placed North Macedonia, who were held 1-1 at home by Kazakhstan on Monday with Enis Bardhi replying for the hosts after Dinmukhamed Karaman's opener.Switzerland could have qualified from Group B with the right combination of results, but will have to wait until next month after a 0-0 draw in Slovenia.The Swiss are now only three points clear of Kosovo, who beat Sweden 1-0 in Gothenburg thanks to a solitary strike by Fisnik Asllani of Hoffenheim.Sweden's campaign has proven to be a disaster as they sit bottom of the section with just one point despite having Viktor Gyokeres and Alexander Isak starting together up front -- they have failed to even score in their last three matches.",France held to a 2-2 draw by Iceland in 2026 World Cup qualifying.

Cape Verde, a small island nation of 550,000 people, made history on Monday by qualifying for their first-ever FIFA World Cup . They defeated Eswatini 3-0 in Praia to secure their spot in the 2026 tournament, becoming the second-smallest country after Iceland to reach the World Cup finals.The Blue Sharks dominated Group D with 23 points, finishing ahead of eight-time World Cup participants Cameroon. Goals from Dailon Livramento, Willy Semedo, and Stopira in the second half sparked wild celebrations across the capital city Praia.""Giving this happiness to these people is enormous... it's a victory for all the Cape Verdean people and, above all, a victory for those who fought for our independence,"" said coach Pedro Brito, known as Bubista, highlighting the achievement's significance during the country's 50th independence anniversary.The victory triggered a carnival-like atmosphere in Praia. Fans poured onto the streets, honking horns and setting off fireworks. Local reggae and funana music filled the air as people danced in celebration.The team's success is remarkable given their rocky start to the campaign. After drawing with Angola and losing to Cameroon, they won five straight matches to secure qualification. The Blue Sharks rely heavily on players born outside the country to Cape Verdean parents or grandparents.Emotional captain Ryan Mendes said: ""Honestly, I don't have the words to describe this moment. I'm very, very happy."" Veteran goalkeeper Vozinha, 39, added: ""I have been dreaming of this moment since I was a child. It's time to celebrate.""FIFA President Gianni Infantino praised the historic achievement, saying it would likely ""power a new generation of football lovers"" across the nation.Cape Verde join Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and Ghana as the six African teams that have already qualified for the 2026 World Cup, to be held in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.The triumph is particularly meaningful for this former Portuguese colony, which gained independence in 1975 and first attempted World Cup qualification in 2002. The team has shown steady progress, reaching the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals in both 2013 and 2023.","Cape Verde become second-smallest country after Iceland to reach World Cup finals.

Poll Do you think Ghana can make a deeper run than their 2010 quarter-finals berth at the 2026 World Cup? Yes, they have a strong team. No, the competition is tougher.

Ghana sealed their spot at the 2026 FIFA World Cup after a hard-fought 1-0 win over Comoros in Accra on Sunday, becoming the fifth African nation to qualify alongside Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia.Midfielder Mohammed Kudus was the hero for the Black Stars, scoring the only goal of the match just two minutes after half-time. A packed 40,000-strong home crowd roared as the Tottenham playmaker pounced on a loose ball in the six-yard box and tapped home following a goalmouth scramble.While Ghana dominated first-half possession, their slow and predictable approach meant Comoros goalkeeper Adel Anzimati-Aboudou was rarely tested. But Kudus’s early second-half strike settled the contest and erased memories of past heartbreaks — Comoros had stunned Ghana at the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations and again in the World Cup qualifiers two years ago.The victory saw Ghana top Group I with 25 points from 10 matches, ahead of Madagascar (19) and Mali (18). It marks Ghana’s fifth World Cup appearance, with their best showing coming in 2010 when they reached the quarter-finals in South Africa before losing to Uruguay on penalties.The result also vindicated Ghana’s decision to persist with coach Otto Addo, who was under pressure after the team’s disastrous 2025 AFCON qualifying campaign, where they finished last in their group without a win.Elsewhere, Egypt defeated Guinea-Bissau 1-0 in Cairo despite resting Mohamed Salah , while Niger shocked Zambia 1-0 to climb to third in the mini-league of second-placed teams.Four more automatic African qualifiers will be decided on Monday and Tuesday, with Benin, Cape Verde, Ivory Coast, and Senegal currently leading their respective groups as the race to the expanded 48-team World Cup heats up.",Ghana beat Comoros 1-0 to seal their place at the 2026 World Cup.

Erling Haaland continued his sensational form for Norway, scoring a hat-trick to surpass 50 international goals in record time as his team thrashed Israel 5-0 in Oslo on Saturday. The win edges Norway closer to their first World Cup finals since 1998.The match unfolded against the backdrop of political unrest, with hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators chanting “Free Palestine” to protest Israel’s actions in Gaza. Norwegian police used tear gas to disperse the crowd and made several arrests. Inside Ullevaal Stadium, a small group of Israeli fans waved flags and held a banner reading “Let the Ball Talk!”Norway now top Group I with 18 points, six ahead of second-placed Italy, who defeated Estonia 3-1 in Tallinn. The result leaves the Norwegians firmly in control as they aim for qualification for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Israel, meanwhile, will face Italy in Udine on Tuesday, needing a win to stay in contention.Haaland became the fastest player in men’s international football to reach 50 goals, now boasting 51 in just 46 games. His first penalty was saved by Israel goalkeeper Daniel Peretz, and even a retake was denied, but Norway surged ahead through an 18th-minute own goal by Anan Khalaili.Haaland added his first goal soon after, with Israel contributing another own goal through Idan Nachmias. He then completed the hat-trick with a header and a final nod-in, marking his sixth career international hat-trick.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

World No. 204 Valentin Vacherot from Monaco took the tennis world by storm on Saturday, defeating an ailing Novak Djokovic 6-3, 6-4 in the Shanghai Masters semi-finals. The 26-year-old qualifier overcame the 38-year-old Serbian, who struggled with vomiting, leg injuries, and fatigue under 31°C heat and 62 percent humidity, to book a spot in Sunday’s final against either his cousin Arthur Rinderknech or Daniil Medvedev.“I’m trying to pinch myself, is this real?” Vacherot said after his career-defining win. “To have Novak on the other side of the court was first of all an invaluable experience for me. I have a hundred feelings right now.”But who exactly is Valentin Vacherot? Tennis runs deep in his family. Born in 1998, he started playing at a young age and went on to play college tennis for Texas A&M University. Turning professional in 2022, he is coached by his half-brother Benjamin Balleret, who himself is the son of former players Bernard Balleret and Alexia Dechaume-Balleret. Tennis talent clearly runs in the family, as Vacherot’s cousin Arthur Rinderknech is also a former US Open pre-quarterfinalist.Vacherot first came into the spotlight by winning his maiden ATP Challenger title at the Nonthaburi Challenger in 2022. He made his Grand Slam debut last year at Roland Garros, becoming the first player from the Monegasque Tennis Federation to reach the main draw, though he lost in the first round to Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.Against Djokovic, Vacherot’s composure shone through. After Djokovic broke in the opening game, Vacherot immediately broke back. As Djokovic’s physical troubles worsened in the seventh game, requiring medical treatment and repeated stretches, Vacherot seized the moment, breaking again to take the first set with two aces. Despite a brief resistance from Djokovic in the second set, Vacherot held his nerve to serve out the match, denying Djokovic a chance at a fifth Shanghai Masters title.This remarkable victory cements Vacherot’s arrival on the big stage and marks a career-defining moment for the young Monegasque, whose journey from college tennis to shocking one of the sport’s greatest legends will be remembered for years to come.","Valentin Vacherot beats Novak Djokovic 6-3, 6-4 in the Shanghai Masters semi- finals.

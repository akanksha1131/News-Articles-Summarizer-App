Jos Buttler Exclusive Interview: I owe Jayawardene for letting me open in T20

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants held their nerve to clinch a thrilling 12-run victory over Mumbai Indians in Match 16 of IPL 2025 at the Ekana Cricket Stadium on Friday.While Mitchell Marsh’s explosive 60 (off 31 balls) and Hardik Pandya ’s five-wicket haul dominated headlines early on, it was young leg-spinner Digvesh Singh Rathi who turned the tide in LSG’s favour with a sensational spell under pressure and notched up the Player of the Match award in the process.Batting first, LSG posted a commanding 203/8, thanks to Marsh’s 60 off 31 balls and late fireworks from David Miller (27 off 14).Hardik Pandya was the pick of the MI bowlers, bagging five wickets, including key dismissals of Nicolas Pooran, Rishabh Pant, David Miller, and Aiden Markram, keeping MI within reach.However, the real story unfolded in the second innings, where Mumbai seemed to be cruising with Suryakumar Yadav in ominous form.At 86/2 in the 9th over, MI looked set to chase the target down. But Digvesh Singh Rathi, playing only his second IPL match, changed the game with a crucial breakthrough. He removed the dangerous Naman Dhir for 46 with a sharp delivery that skidded on and bowled him, derailing MI’s momentum.The spinner's figures of 1/21 were not just economical, but tactically brilliant.Bowling with superb control and guile, he applied pressure in the middle overs, conceding just 11 runs in his final two overs when MI were gearing up for a final assault.His tight spell forced the batters to take risks at the other end, eventually leading to Suryakumar’s dismissal in the 17th over.Even with Hardik Pandya launching a late onslaught, LSG’s total proved just out of reach for MI, who ended at 191/5.Rathi’s composure and fearless approach stood out, marking him as a rising star in LSG’s ranks.This win lifts LSG to sixth on the table and gives their campaign fresh momentum.For MI, questions remain over their middle-order finishing and death bowling. But if there’s one name they won’t forget from this game, it’s Digvesh Singh Rathi.",Lucknow Super Giants beat Mumbai Indians by 12 runs in IPL 2025. Digvesh Singh Rathi was named Player of the Match. Mitchell Marsh and David Miller top scored for LSG.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals (RR), now back under the leadership of Sanju Samson , will take on an in-form Punjab Kings (PBKS) in a high-stakes Indian Premier League IPL ) 2025 clash on Saturday.A big focus of the match will be on a struggling Yashasvi Jaiswal , who will be eager to shift attention back to his batting. Jaiswal has had a turbulent few weeks — switching domestic allegiances from Mumbai to Goa amid reported internal rifts and posting underwhelming scores of 1, 29 and 4 in this IPL season. The 22-year-old southpaw, hungry for leadership roles, now finds himself needing runs more than ever, especially after being overlooked for the Champions Trophy squad.Samson’s return as captain comes after RR’s inconsistent run under stand-in skipper Riyan Parag, whose leadership failed to inspire despite a narrow win over Chennai Super Kings. The Royals’ batting remains heavily reliant on Samson, with Shimron Hetmyer expected to provide the finishing firepower. However, Jaiswal and Dhruv Jurel’s form will be key in putting up or chasing a big score.Punjab Kings, meanwhile, come in hot — led impressively by Shreyas Iyer , who has scored back-to-back half-centuries and already smashed 13 sixes in two games, equaling his tally from all of last season. Iyer's tactical nous has stood out too, with sharp field placements and smart bowling changes, including effective use of Glenn Maxwell the spinner, who’s looked sharper than even Yuzvendra Chahal.Rajasthan’s bowling attack — with Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana, Wanindu Hasaranga, and Tushar Deshpande — is solid but not fearsome.

Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) has slipped to the bottom of the IPL points table following a crushing defeat to their former IPL final rival, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). The loss marks SRH’s third consecutive defeat, highlighting their struggle to find form this season. With key players such as Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma failing to make an impact, the team’s performance has been below expectations, and their once-feared dominance seems to be missing this year.Despite early setbacks in their batting line-up, SRH's bowlers have also been unable to provide the necessary breakthroughs, leaving the team in a precarious position. As the season progresses, the Orange Army will need to rediscover their charm if they are to turn their fortunes around.Meanwhile, Kolkata Knight Riders have experienced a significant boost, climbing to the fifth spot after their convincing victory over Hyderabad. KKR’s victory was powered by standout performances from Vaibhav Arora and Varun Chakravarthy. Arora, with his stellar bowling, removed Travis Head on just the second ball of the match and followed it up with a second-wicket maiden over of the season. Chakravarthy continued to bother batters with his mystery spin, claiming three vital wickets.KKR’s batting was no less impressive, as Venkatesh Iyer and young Angkrish Raghuvanshi played pivotal roles in pushing the team’s total to 200 runs, giving them a commanding position. With both departments in form, KKR looks set to pose serious challenges to other teams as the tournament progresses.Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals continue to dominate top position in the points table. Both teams remain unbeaten with two wins from two matches. The revamped squads of both teams have been performing exceptionally well, and they appear to be in prime position to continue their dominance.Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Gujarat Titans (GT) occupy the third and fourth spots, respectively, both with four points. Gujarat Titans, under the leadership of the young and dynamic Shubman Gill, are on a winning streak, showcasing their excellent form early in the season. On the other hand, RCB, after a strong start with two wins, faced a setback in their last match, adding some uncertainty to their campaign.As the IPL season progresses, the points table is expected to undergo more shifts, and teams are gearing up for intense battles in pursuit of the iconic IPL trophy. With the competition heating up, the excitement around the tournament is set to reach new heights in the coming weeks.","Sunrisers Hyderabad have slipped to the bottom of the IPL points table.

As Rajasthan Royals (RR) prepare to face Punjab Kings (PBKS) on Saturday, all eyes will be on Yashasvi Jaiswal , who has made headlines off the field but is yet to fire with the bat this IPL season. After switching from Mumbai to Goa amid controversy, the young left-hander has struggled for form, managing scores of just 1, 29 and 4. With Sanju Samson returning as captain, RR will hope Jaiswal steps up to support a batting unit that relies heavily on its skipper.The Royals were far from convincing under stand-in skipper Riyan Parag and now face a stern test against an in-form Punjab side led smartly by Shreyas Iyer . Iyer has been in red-hot form, smashing back-to-back fifties and already matching his last season’s six tally in just two games. His tactical captaincy and improved power-hitting have made Punjab serious contenders early in the tournament.Rajasthan’s bowling — featuring Archer, Theekshana, and Hasaranga — is competent but lacks firepower, making a big total crucial. RR will need Jaiswal, Jurel and Hetmyer to fire alongside Samson to stand a chance. Expect a high-scoring encounter with leadership and batting form likely to decide the outcome.Rajasthan Royals hold the upper hand in their rivalry with Punjab Kings, having emerged victorious in 16 of their 28 meetings.

You either get a good ball or something else happens,"" Axar said with a laugh. ""Vo yahi bol rahe the ki tu ek kaam kar, kuch vidhi vidhi karwale (He was suggesting I get some rituals done to correct it).""Beyond the banter, Axar credited Dhoni for playing a key role in shaping his career.""I have a very close connection with Mahi bhai.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians fans hoping for a Rohit Sharma resurgence were left disappointed on Friday evening, as the star opener was ruled out of the high-stakes clash against Lucknow Super Giants at the Ekana Cricket Stadium.The official word from MI captain Hardik Pandya at the toss was clear: “Rohit was hit on the knee. He is missing out.”Also See: MI vs LSG Live Score, IPL 2025 While the extent of the injury isn’t yet known, the timing of the setback couldn’t be worse for both the player and the franchise.Rohit, who has been under scrutiny for a string of low scores this season, was expected to bounce back in a crucial match that could shape Mumbai’s campaign.With only two points from three matches, MI currently sit sixth on the table and are still searching for consistency.Hardik, who opted to bowl first after winning the toss, downplayed the surface factor and focused on execution.“We’ve spoken in the group about not overthinking the pitch. It’s about adaptation and sticking to the right plans,” he said.He also hinted at Jasprit Bumrah returning soon, another major boost for Mumbai in the coming fixtures.Rohit’s absence means the batting lineup will have to reshuffle, potentially opening the door for a young replacement to make an impression.Meanwhile, Rishabh Pant ’s LSG will also be looking to turn things around after a disappointing start to their home campaign, and the pressure is now squarely on both sides to deliver.For now, Mumbai must regroup without one of their most experienced campaigners, and fans will hope Rohit's knee issue is minor and not a sign of a longer layoff.Aiden Markram, Mitchell Marsh, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh Pant(w/c), Ayush Badoni, David Miller, Abdul Samad, Shardul Thakur, Digvesh Singh Rathi, Akash Deep, Avesh KhanWill Jacks, Ryan Rickelton(w), Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya(c), Naman Dhir, Raj Bawa, Mitchell Santner, Trent Boult, Ashwani Kumar, Deepak Chahar, Vignesh Puthur",Rohit Sharma ruled out of Mumbai Indians' clash with Lucknow Super Giants.

The Catalans continue their impressive unbeaten run in 2025, now stretching to 21 games.Barcelona, who have won the Copa del Rey a record 31 times, dominated the match following the entertaining 4-4 draw in the first leg.The defeat leaves Atletico Madrid with limited objectives for the remainder of the season, as they now trail Barcelona by nine points in La Liga with nine matches left.""We can't relax, we have to keep believing and working, with humility and I'm sure good things will come,"" Torres told Movistar. ""If a final is already a huge motivation, imagine playing against your most direct rival.""Real Madrid secured their place in the final after a 5-4 aggregate victory over Real Sociedad, following a 4-4 draw at the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday.Barcelona manager Hansi Flick reinstated Raphinha to the starting lineup, with the Brazilian winger becoming a target for Atletico's defensive tactics.Cesar Azpilicueta received a yellow card for a challenge on Raphinha, surviving a VAR review for a potential red card, while Rodrigo de Paul was also booked for a hard tackle.Seventeen-year-old Lamine Yamal impressed on the opposite wing, creating chances and providing the assist for Torres's goal with a well-weighted pass.Atletico Madrid introduced Alexander Sorloth at halftime, who had scored in the previous three meetings between the teams this season.Sorloth missed a clear opportunity early in the second half, opting to shoot instead of passing to an unmarked Antoine Griezmann.The Norwegian striker later had a goal disallowed for offside as Atletico increased their pressure on Barcelona's defense.""We played really bravely here, it was not easy, especially in the second half,"" Flick told Barca One.

Arsenal lose Gabriel

Nottingham Forest secured a crucial 1-0 victory over Manchester United at the City Ground on Tuesday, strengthening their Champions League hopes, while Arsenal maintained pressure on league leaders Liverpool with a 2-1 win against Fulham, marked by Bukayo Saka's return from injury and goal.Former Manchester United winger Anthony Elanga scored the decisive goal for Forest just five minutes into the match with a remarkable solo effort, running from his own half before beating Andre Onana with a low shot.Third-placed Forest now hold a 10-point advantage over Newcastle in sixth position, with the top five teams likely to qualify for Champions League due to English clubs' strong European performances this season.Forest, two-time European champions, haven't competed in the Champions League since 1980 when they were title holders.Elanga, who left United in 2023, has found success under Nuno Espirito Santo at Forest.""He's a special boy and he gives this team his speed. He does it by himself and we are delighted,"" said Nuno about Elanga's performance.Forest's impressive season continues despite playing 120 minutes plus penalties against Brighton in Saturday's FA Cup quarter-final and missing top scorer Chris Wood through injury.United's manager Ruben Amorim expressed frustration with his team's performance: ""This season is like that. We had a lot of shots on goal, we pushed the opponent to the last third, but in the last third we had a lack of quality. We should have won this game, not even drawn, but in the end we have lost three points.""United remain in 13th place, still unable to secure consecutive Premier League wins this season.In Arsenal's match, Mikel Merino's deflected shot gave them the lead before Saka headed in his first goal since returning from injury.""A beautiful moment to see how much our people love and respect Bukayo,"" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said regarding the warm reception Saka received.Arsenal's victory was overshadowed by defender Gabriel Magalhaes's injury exit, adding to their injury concerns ahead of their Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid.Saka made an immediate impact after replacing Ethan Nwaneri, scoring his tenth goal of the season by heading in Martinelli's flick from Merino's cross.Rodrigo Muniz scored a late consolation goal for Fulham, whose European ambitions took a hit with the defeat.Arsenal's injury list continues to grow with Jurrien Timber also leaving the game, joining already sidelined players Riccardo Calafiori, Ben White, Kai Havertz, and Gabriel Jesus.The victory reduced Arsenal's gap to league leaders Liverpool to nine points.In other Premier League action, Wolves boosted their survival prospects with a 1-0 win over West Ham at Molineux, with Jorgen Strand Larsen scoring the only goal, moving them 12 points clear of the relegation zone.",Nottingham Forest beat Manchester United 1-0 at the City Ground.

A 1-4 loss to Argentina, their bete noire, in the World Cup qualifier rang throughout the football cathedrals of the world, with stark images of the Mineirazo blinking on the stream of consciousness and social media.That had happened on the fateful June evening, the agony in Belo Horizonte, where Brazil suffered a humiliating 7-1 defeat to Germany on their own turf in the 2014 World Cup semifinal. Two unsuccessful World Cup campaigns followed, which took a toll on Tite, Ramon Menezes (caretaker), Fernando Diniz (caretaker). Last week, the sword, as expected, fell on Dorival Junior .Amid such changes, Brazil’s tendency to implode occasionally has been the excruciating constant. It is not the first time in the recent past that Brazil conceded four. Swamped with information that’s mostly unnecessary and used to obfuscate thought and reason, the world forgot that under Menezes in a June 2023 friendly, Sadio Mane’s Senegal pumped as many past Ederson, the Man City goalkeeper. Last week, however, the unfortunate gloveman was Bento.With 18 months to go for the World Cup, Brazil’s suffering against an Argentina that was without Lionel Messi, only strengthens the notion that the Canarinhos will qualify for the World Cup 2026, but nothing beyond. Thankfully with six out of 10 ten teams making it out of the South American group in this time’s inflated 48-team competition, Brazil and its fans don’t have to spend sleepless nights.The question that keeps popping up like unwelcome adverts, though, is, what ails Pele ’s team? Well, as the football romantic Simon Kuper says, “Brazil will always be Pele’s team.” For a while, it was also Ronaldo’s team. Post-Ronaldo, the history of Brazil is a history of struggle against Europe, non-transference of knowledge, and a story of brilliant individuals failing to play as a team.Their World Cup campaigns are a repeat-show of slipping on European banana peels. In 2006, it was Zidane’s France. Four years later in South Africa, it was Wesley Sneijder who rose above the yellow shirts. In their own backyard, Belo Horizonte, Brazil scripted their darkest chapter against Germany. Kevin de Bryune’s Belgium undid Neymar-powered Brazilians in Russia. In Qatar, Luka Modric’s Croatia cut short their run even though hardly any non-Croatian remembers Mislav Orsic the provider or Bruno Petkovic, the one who equalized.It marked Brazil’s fifth elimination in the World Cup against European opposition since a 2-0 victory over Germany in the 2002 final. No wonder Vinicius is left crying after the fresh debacle on the banks of River Plate.“Everyone did badly, we played badly, and Argentina played excellent,” Vinicius said, “We must rethink everything we’ve been doing, because the pressure will come, the people want us to win.“The World Cup is a year away and I’ve already played in a World Cup and I don’t want to lose again. I think we must do a lot of different things and take the good things we’re doing in qualifying to build a squad. Everyone knows how difficult it is to play in this kit, but we must keep our heads up. We’re going to qualify for the World Cup and try to do everything for our country,” he would add.Perhaps, the screams are a little too late in coming. Lest we forget, the country’s Olympic team, the stepping stone to the Selecao, failed to qualify for Paris 2024. Those who could recall another friendly against Spain under Dorival, the lingering image was how Lamine Yamal taught the visitors lessons in dribbling, a skill that was once the domain of the men in yellow.The words of Mario Zagallo, a World Cup winner as both a player and coach, turned out to be prophetic. He warned that the sellout of homegrown talent has led to the erosion of Brazil’s football identity. He was speaking right after Mineirazo; even a decade later — till his death this January — he wasn’t proven wrong.Leaving the shores early for Europe, is almost a Brazilian way of life. One can argue with some truth that they don’t make Pele, Garrincha, a Romario or Ronaldo anymore, just as they don’t make Shakespeare anymore.Raphinha is the key to Barcelona’s current degree of hotness. Players with lesser ability have come together to win football’s highest honour with organization, coaching acumen and a slice of luck. Marquinhos, for his life, will not be able to explain how Petkovic’s shot took that deflection to send Alisson the wrong way in Qatar. Neither could Tite.Dorival Junior is the third coach that the CBF has sacked after Tite resigned following the 2022 exit. Often quick changes in coaching staff are held responsible. Mario Zagallo was appointed just three months prior to the 1970 World Cup. And the team that rediscovered the ‘beautiful game” under Tele Santana in 1982, considered to be the best team not to have won the World Cup, had been under his charge for a full two years.In Brazil, it has always been the triumph of the individual over the collective. Unreasonable it may seem, as we are constantly feeding off European models. No one can explain Branco’s goal from a free-kick against Holland in 1994. Or Oliver Kahn’s spilling of Rivaldo’s stinger with Ronaldo sniffing around.In 2002, Brazil’s humungous qualification struggle had been buried into oblivion. Among four automatic slots, Brazil hadslipped in claiming the third! Reading Brazil, we instantly go back some 75 years when the world empathized with the struggle of the underprivileged. The intermediate changes in the society are overlooked as we lament Brazil’s reversals.Samindra Kunti, author of Brazil 1970, says, “The romantic idea of football is dead and we are forever expecting Brazil to rekindle the dream.”Maybe Brazil have wasted three years of preparation time or who knows, someone like Zagallo will appear to inspire and wipe away Vinicius’s tears.Marcela Mora y Araujo, who specialises in South American football, feels that the debacle against Argentina is just a blip and not a crisis.“Brazil’s qualification road has not always been smooth if we go by the history. They always have an ace up their sleeve.”",Brazil lost 1-4 to Argentina in a World Cup qualifier in Rio de Janeiro. It was the Canarinhos' fifth World Cup defeat against European opposition since 2002 final.

‘One defeat cannot define who Brazil are’

Chennai: With the World Cup little over a year away, Brazil find themselves in a not-so-ideal situation. The five-time champions, often expected to cruise through the qualifiers, are huffing and puffing on their way to the football extravaganza.The South American heavyweights are terribly low on morale after enduring their heaviest defeat in WC qualifying history, a 1-4 drubbing at the hands of bitter rivals and defending champions Argentina recently. Making matters worse, Brazil are without a head coach following the ouster of Dorival Jr and have gone back to square one.World Cup winners Dunga and Gilberto Silva , who know a thing or two about dazzling for Brazil on the global stage, remarked that the national federation should have finalised the manager for the World Cup a long time ago. “We have a lot of good coaches in Brazil, but here is the problem. We have one year to go for the WC and we are still looking for a coach. Postponing things might be the biggest problem. You start winning the World Cup off the field,” said Dunga, who is in Chennai for the Brazil Legends-India All Stars match and Football Plus summit.The seasoned Carlo Ancelotti, currently under contract at La Liga giants Real Madrid, has been heavily linked with the Brazil top job. “Sometimes, people take decisions based on emotions. This is not the solution. Sometimes, we have to be in this kind of situation, which is very disappointing. We are going to look for a manager one year before the start of the competition. This makes the work of the players even harder (tougher). I hope that whoever they (federation) decide, we start to play well again,” said Gilberto.Brazil have been let down by the indifferent international form of potential game-changers Vinicius Jr and Raphinha, players who have been delivering at club level.On why they are struggling to replicate their club form playing for the country, Gilberto said: “There is a massive difference between club and country. In a club, you are there every day, training with your colleagues and coach. In the national team, you may have the opportunity to spend time with your colleagues and manager about six times a year. It is not enough. In the short time, the players have to do as much as they can to maintain a high level.”The 2002 WC-winning member, who made the defensive midfielder’s position his own, added: “When you are in the national team of any country, there is massive pressure. When you are in Brazil, people do not understand how high the pressure is, how difficult it is to play under pressure. We, as supporters of the Brazil team, put pressure on everyone. We have been there, so we know the difficulties. We have to support them.”Dunga stressed that patience is key when trying to create a world-beating unit, something that Brazil have not managed to construct over the last 20 years. “We have to understand how hard it is to be a champion. We had a very strong group and it takes time to build that. It takes time to build champions and legends,” said Dunga, a 1994 WC winner.“Brazil struggled between 1970 and 1994, they did not win (the WC) for many years. Talent and technique are important, but only those are not enough to become a champion. It is important to have a ‘team’, which understands what discipline and sacrifice are. Sometimes, one shot is all that is there for us to win,” added Dunga, who also served as Brazil chief coach.Gilberto emphasised that the recent thrashing against Argentina cannot be considered the end of the world for Brazil. “It does not matter when we win a couple of games. When we lose one game, it is a big story. While preparing for the 2010 World Cup, we beat Argentina 3-1. From time to time, these kinds of situations happen. One defeat cannot define what we are at the moment. We should have in mind what we are capable of,” said Gilberto.","Brazil are without a head coach following the ouster of Dorival Jr. World Cup winners Dunga and Gilberto Silva say the national federation should have finalised the manager a long time ago.

Bombay Sport Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner , the three-time Grand Slam champion , received a three-month ban after testing positive twice for the banned substance clostebol .The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) agreed to the ban after Sinner admitted ""partial responsibility"" for team mistakes.Umberto Ferrara , Sinner's former physical trainer, has spoken publicly about the scandal for the first time. He claims to be blameless and places the responsibility squarely on Sinner's former physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi .""I was perfectly aware that it was banned so I always kept it safely stashed away in my wash bag. I suggested to Naldi to use it for a cut which had not healed and was affecting his work. I was absolutely clear when I spoke to him about the nature of the product and it was imperative it never came into contact with Jannik. In effect I told him to use it only in my bathroom. Naldi did not deny he had been told, but he said he could not recall,"" he told Gazzetta dello Sport.Ferrara states that he had been using a spray containing clostebol, prescribed by a doctor for an illness, and had kept it safely stored away.He suggested that Naldi use the spray for a cut that was not healing, but explicitly warned him to use it only in Ferrara's bathroom and to ensure it never came into contact with Sinner.According to Ferrara, Naldi did not deny being warned about the nature of the product but claimed he could not recall the instructions.Ferrara alleges that Naldi treated Sinner without gloves and without washing his hands after using the spray, despite the warnings.Ferrara acknowledges that, in hindsight, he would not have handled the situation the same way. He expresses regret over the behavior of others and claims to have suffered due to the ""bad faith of some.""Sinner's suspension ends on May 4, allowing him to return in time for the French Open. The clay-court tournament in Hamburg will be his second tournament after his return, followed by the Italian Open in Rome.","Jannik Sinner received a three-month ban after testing positive twice for the banned substance clostebol.

Czech teen sensation Jakub Mensik stunned Novak Djokovic in straight sets 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (7/4) to clinch the Miami Open championship at Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday. The 19-year-old world number 54 captured his maiden ATP Tour title in impressive fashion.The victory prevented Djokovic from reaching the milestone of 100 professional tennis titles in his illustrious career.Mensik overcame rain delays and a determined Djokovic to claim the Miami Open title. At 19, he became the second-youngest champion in the tournament’s history, following Carlos Alcaraz, who won as an 18-year-old in 2022.The match was delayed for nearly six hours due to rain in Florida, leaving Mensik with plenty of time to process the challenge ahead — preventing Djokovic from clinching his 100th career title.Born in September 2005, when Djokovic had already broken into the ATP top-100, Mensik refused to be overwhelmed by the occasion. Instead, he delivered a near-flawless performance, using his powerful serve and aggressive baseline game to become the first Czech player sinceTomas Berdych in 2005 to win an ATP Masters 1000 event.Djokovic, appearing troubled by an issue under his right eye, frequently applied eye drops and consulted his team.Still, Mensik capitalised, racing to a 3-0 lead in the first set before Djokovic clawed back. In the tie-break, Mensik dominated, building a 5-0 advantage before closing it out with an overhead smash.The second set saw Djokovic applying pressure from the baseline, but Mensik remained composed, dropping just one break point in the match. With 77% of first-serve points won, the Czech teen sealed a statement victory, toppling a legend and etching his name in Miami Open history.","Jakub Mensik beat Novak Djokovic in straight sets 7-6 (7/4), 7-4.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka secured her first Miami Open title by defeating American Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the WTA 1000 event final at Hard Rock Stadium on Saturday. This victory marks Sabalenka's second title of 2025, following her Brisbane triumph in January, and her eighth WTA 1000 title overall.Sabalenka, who had recently lost the Indian Wells final to Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva, showed determination not to repeat that outcome in Miami.""I'm super happy to have this trophy, I was able to play my best tennis in the final,"" said Sabalenka, acknowledging Pegula's performance and referencing their previous encounter at the US Open final.The first set was marked by service struggles, featuring seven breaks of serve. Pegula challenged Sabalenka by drawing her to the net, but the momentum shifted when Pegula served at 6-5 down.Sabalenka secured the first set with a combination of a delicate forehand drop and a down-the-line winner.Despite losing her first service game in the second set, Sabalenka quickly regained control. She broke twice to establish a 3-1 lead and maintained her dominance to complete the victory in one hour and 27 minutes.""I think I was able to completely forget about (it being) the final, about the outside things and I was just so focused on the game,"" Sabalenka reflected.The Belarusian has won 12 of her last 14 matches against top 10 players, attributing her success to her performance in crucial moments.""It is all about those key moments of the match, about playing aggressive and staying with the game plan, going for shots without being afraid of losing the point,"" she explained.This marked Pegula's third loss to Sabalenka in a final. The American acknowledged Sabalenka's superiority on hard courts.""I consider myself one of the world's best hard-court players, but she's probably the best,"" Pegula stated after the match.""She just keeps ... raising her level in key moments of the match when she needs to, and I feel like that was the big difference today and the last few times I have played her,"" Pegula added.Despite the loss, Pegula expressed satisfaction with her tournament performance: ""Happy to be in another big 1000 final and having consistent results and keep going deep in tournaments. The reason we play is to put ourselves in good chances to win these events. I was able to do that the last couple weeks.""At 26, Sabalenka has accumulated 19 WTA Tour titles, with 17 on hard courts, including three Grand Slam singles titles - the 2023 Australian Open, 2024 Australian Open, and 2024 US Open.Sabalenka's on-court demeanour has evolved from her earlier years, showing more composure during challenging moments.""I think before, every time I would lose my serve, one game, I could just completely lose the match because I would still be thinking about that first game,"" she reflected.Sabalenka credited her past serving challenges for developing a stronger overall game and mental approach.""When I was struggling with my serve I had to push myself on the return and had to play with something else. So now, every time I am losing (serve) I know that I have weapons, that I can return well and that I can break back,"" she said.""I think that challenge really helped me to be more focused and not get too crazy on court after losing a game on my serve,"" she added.The Miami Open men's final is scheduled for Sunday, featuring Novak Djokovic against Czech teenager Jakub Mensik, with Djokovic pursuing his 100th professional title.","Aryna Sabalenka beats Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the final of the Miami Open.

Football superstar and Argentina's World Cup-winning captain Lionel Messi was in attendance at the Hard Rock Stadium on Friday, where Novak Djokovic advanced to the Miami Open final with a commanding victory over 14th-seeded Grigor DimitrovIn pursuit of his 100th singles title, and seventh in Miami, Djokovic won 6-2, 6-3 and will face upstart Jakub Mensik, who upset Taylor Fritz 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4) in the other semfinial, for the title.During his post-match court interview, Djokovic recognised that Messi, who currently represents Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, was present, referring to him as ""King Leo.""Djokovic revealed that Messi, accompanied by his wife and children, visited the locker room where they exchanged presents. While Djokovic had previously attended Messi's matches, this marked the first occasion where the football star watched him play.""Obviously, it's a thrill to have his whole family,'' Djokovic said. ""It's a huge honour. He's such a great athlete, not just a football player. His impact on the world of sports in the last 20 years has been immense.""To have him watch me live brings me great joy and excitement and also a little pressure. It's definitely different when he brings his family. I was touched by that.""The 37-year-old Djokovic's performance hasn't been up to his lofty standards, beginning with a withdrawal due to injury at the Australian Open in January. At Indian Wells earlier this month, he suffered a first-round defeat against Botic van de Zandschulp.During the third game, play was halted when security personnel escorted a disruptive spectator from the venue. The chair umpire descended from his position and approached the stands while summoning security staff.Dimitrov engaged in a verbal exchange with the spectator and proceeded to direct the umpire's attention to the location of the troublesome fan at the sideline.""It's just heckling, it's fine,'' Dimitrov said. ""I'm a very calm guy overall. I don't pick any fights but don't trigger me.''Despite Dimitrov securing an early break against Djokovic in the opening game, the Serbian regained composure and secured the first set in 32 minutes.The current men's record holder of 24 Grand Slam titles displayed remarkable serving efficiency, landing 87% of first serves with merely six misses throughout the match. He maintained exceptional control, recording only five unforced errors during the 70-minute contest.""Now I know how it feels to be (John) Isner and (Reilly) Opelka,'' Djokovic said of two serving behemoths. ""Maybe my serve has been a bit underrated.""Djokovic extended his dominant head-to-head record against Dimitrov to 13-1. The Bulgarian player showcased his finest performance during the match.""He wears confidence like a stain on your shirt,'' Dimitrov said. ""It's beautiful to see. Only a few athletes on earth possess that quality.''Mensik, who entered the Miami Open as world number 54, has yet to reach a final in an ATP 1,000-point tournament.In a crucial moment against Fritz, he displayed remarkable composure at 4-4 in the final tiebreaker, securing victory by winning three consecutive points.Throughout the match lasting two hours and 25 minutes, Mensik failed to break serve but managed to win with a brilliant backhand winner down the line at 5-4. Fritz subsequently lost the next two points, sending a forehand long after a 20-shot exchange and netting a forehand on match point.Prior to the match, Mensik had a handshake with Messi. ""I didn't wash my hands before I stepped on the court,"" Mensik said.Tennis inspiration came to Mensik through Djokovic, whom he faced in a three-set match at the Shanghai Masters last October. The age difference between them stands at 18 years.","Novak Djokovic beats Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3 to reach Miami Open final.

She has spent six years immersed in tennis, training alongside top coaches and aspiring tour players.Her disciplined approach stems more from family influence than her academy training.""It's not something I learned in the academy.

It's also something my family has guided me through, it's part of my family's values.""""They are successful people in business, they are successful in their own fields and people I look up to.

I really wanted to have my family see me winning, but I know they'd be happy just to see me compete in this setting.""""And Toni also came in to Miami. That did mean a lot, because I have been working closely with him for so long, alongside my main coaches from the academy, it showed a lot about the confidence and the pride the academy has in me.""Eala recalled a previous photograph with Swiatek at an academy graduation event two years ago.

Miami Gardens: Alexandra Eala , a 19-year-old wildcard from the Philippines, produced a huge upset at the Miami Open on Wednesday, defeating world number two Iga Swiatek 6-2 7-5 to reach the semi-finals.Ranked 140th in the world, Eala, the first woman from her country to reach the last eight of a WTA 1000 tournament, took advantage of a unusually poor display from Swiatek, keeping her focus as she fought back from 4-2 down in the second set.Eala broke the Pole for the eighth and final time when Swiatek was serving to stay in the match at 6-5 down in the second set and looked stunned as she struggled to contain her emotions.""I'm just in disbelief right now. It's so surreal,"" she said on court.""I'm so happy and so blessed to be able to compete with such a player on this stage,"" said Eala, who has now beaten three grand slam winners on her route to the last four at Miami -- having dealt with Jelena Ostapenko and Madison Keys before upsetting four-time French Open champion Swiatek.""I'm trusting my shots and I have a great team to tell me that I can do it,"" she said.Eala moved to Spain at the age of 13 to join Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca and Toni Nadal, the Spaniard's uncle and former coach, was in her box for the match.""It meant a lot that he showed up here. It showed the confidence he had in me and the confidence the academy had in me,"" she said.Eala will face Jessica Pegula , who beat Britain's Emma Raducanu in the other quarter-final. The American came through 6-4, 6-7, 6-2.""Just because I won this match or the one before doesn't make the next one any less tough. If anything it will be more tough, so it will take everything that I have,"" said Eala.Swiatek will look forward to moving on to the clay season after conceding that she had been far from her usual level.""I'm sure I wasn't playing my best game and I felt like my forehand collapsed a little, so it wasn't comfortable and Alexandra, for sure, used her chances and pushed me, so for sure she deserves to win this match,"" she said.""I don't want to think about this too long. It's nice to learn from losses but there are other things ahead and I am happy we are going to play on clay.""",Wildcard Alexandra Eala beats world number two Iga Swiatek 6-2 7-5 in Miami. Eala is the first woman from her country to reach the last eight of a WTA 1000 tournament.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka fought back in the second set to secure her spot in the semi-finals of the Miami Open , defeating China's Zheng Qinwen 6-2, 7-5 on Tuesday.This win marks Sabalenka’s first appearance in the semi-finals in Miami, where she’ll meet Italy's Jasmine Paolini for a chance to reach the final.It seemed like a straightforward match for the Belarusian against the ninth seed Zheng as she easily took the first set. However, Zheng made adjustments and came out strong in the second set, breaking Sabalenka twice to establish a 4-2 lead.Sabalenka faced significant pressure at 0-40 but, after showing some frustration, rallied to hold serve and tie it at 4-4. She then unleashed a powerful finish, breaking Zheng again to lead 6-5 and serving confidently to clinch the match.""Honestly every match is tough against her, I always have to work really hard to get the win and today was an incredible level from both of us,"" said Sabalenka.""I'm super happy to get this win. I'm super happy with the way I handled all the emotions and handled the pressure,"" she added.Meanwhile, Paolini advanced to the semi-finals with a decisive 6-3, 6-2 victory over Poland's Magda Linette . The sixth seed, who reached the finals at Wimbledon and the French Open last year, becomes the first Italian to reach the last four in Miami.Despite a lengthy rain delay, Paolini quickly established control over Linette, who had previously upset Coco Gauff in the quarters. Paolini, aiming for her second WTA 1000 title since winning in Dubai last year, exuded confidence and expressed that she knew her hard work would eventually lead to results.""I think I didn't play bad this season but I just didn't have a great result. But I was there. I lost many matches but to big opponents,"" she said.""It was tough but I was repeating to myself that I was there - maybe I just needed a little more confidence and it came here maybe,"" she said.In Wednesday's quarter-finals, second seed Iga Swiatek will face Alexandra Eala, the teenage wildcard from the Philippines who has already defeated Australian Open champion Madison Keys.Additionally, Britain's Emma Raducanu, who is experiencing her best tournament run since winning the US Open in 2021, will take on American fourth seed Jessica Pegula.","Aryna Sabalenka defeated China's Zheng Qinwen 6-2, 7-5 on Tuesday.

Paolini sinks Osaka

Australia's Alex de Minaur put an end to Brazilian talent Joao Fonseca 's challenge at the Miami Open, outlasting the 18-year-old 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in an enthralling contest.Attendance on stadium court had been sparse throughout Monday, but the Hard Rock Stadium turned into a mini-Maracana Stadium for Fonseca's match, complete with Brazilian flags and football-style chanting.Fonseca brought his energetic brand of ultra-attacking tennis, but De Minaur was up to the challenge, coping with both the blistering forehands and the partisan crowd.Such was the dominance of Fonseca's raucous support that the referee switched to Portuguese for his appeals for quiet.But de Minaur won six of the final seven games to move into the fourth round, keeping his cool even when the crowd, at times, disrupted his serve preparation.""Mentally I was ready for this match, I knew I was not only going to play an incredible talent like Joao, playing with immense confidence and nothing to lose, but also an incredible crowd that was on his side from the first point until the last,"" de Minaur said.""One of my biggest strengths is my mentality and that is what got me the win today,"" he added.Top seed Alexander Zverev recovered from a slow start to power into the fourth round of the Miami Open with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Australia's Jordan Thompson.The German was 4-1 down in the first set but then went on a roll, winning eight of the next nine games to progress.Zverev lost in the opening round at Indian Wells, but with Carlos Alcaraz already out in Miami he will fancy his chances of adding to his list of seven Masters 1000 titles.Third-seed Taylor Fritz also moved into the fourth round beating Denis Shapovalov of Canada 7-5, 6-3.The American let slip a 5-2 lead in the first set, but regained control with his serve proving too much for Shapovalov.In the women's draw, third-seed Coco Gauff 's bid ended with a 6-4 6-4 loss to Poland's Magda Linette .Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka eased her way into the last eight with a 6-4, 6-4 win over last year's winner Danielle Collins of the USA.Next, Sabalenka will be up against ninth seeded Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen who reached her second consecutive WTA 1000 quarter-final, with a straight-sets win over Ashlyn Krueger.""I'm super happy to get this win in straight sets and happy with the level I played today,"" said Sabalenka.""She's a tough opponent, and we had a lot of tough and tricky matches in the past. So was very happy to get through this one,"" she added.Italy's Jasmine Paolini enjoyed a 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 comeback win over Naomi Osaka in 2 hours and 15 minutes.Since her comeback from maternity leave 15 months ago, Osaka has been showing some signs of getting back towards her best but Paolini was the first top 10 player Osaka has faced this year.""I don't think that I can say that I've played a lot of matches against top players like this in a while,"" said Osaka.""The way she plays kind of catches me off guard, simply because of her height. I didn't know she could hit like that,"" she added.Emma Raducanu continued her impressive form in Miami, cruising to a 6-1, 6-3 victory in 69 minutes over American Amanda Anisimova, who had eliminated Indian Wells winner Mirra Andreeva on Sunday.It is the first time Raducanu has won four straight WTA Tour main draw matches in a row since her US Open triumph in 2021. She will face American Jessica Pegula next.Raducanu, who has brought in some old faces from the early days of her career for this tournament, said she was benefitting from their presence.""I'm really happy with how things are on and off the court right now and just so happy that's able to transfer on to the match court,"" she said.Alexandra Eala, the 19-year-old from the Philippines who upset Australian Open champion Madison Keys on Sunday, was handed a place in the quarter-finals after her fourth round opponent, Spain's Paula Badosa, pulled out with a lower back injury.In the last eight Eala will face second seed Iga Swiatek who battled past Ukraine's Elina Svitolina 7-6 (7/5) 6-3.","Alex de Minaur beats Joao Fonseca 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in enthralling contest.

CHENNAI: Sankar Muthusamy recorded the biggest win of his nascent career yet, defeating World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12, 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.What surprised many was the way in which the Indian dominated the deciding game. Despite losing the opener, the 21-year-old did not give up and pushed the match to the decider. He was helped by a flurry of unforced errors that Antonsen committed — the Dane hitting the shuttle wide and long on multiple occasions. Sankar made the most of the opportunity and succeeded.The Chennai lad entered the tournament as a qualifier and registered two wins to enter the main draw.“It feels good, and I have been doing well in this tournament. The first game (against Antonsen) lasted for close to 30 minutes and I feel that he became tired after that. I was able to score points from long rallies and capitalised on the situation. I was focusing on one point at a time and did not think much about the result,” Sankar, ranked 64th, told TOI from Basel.“In the deciding game, I was just expecting him to come back at me and was ready to handle the situation. My aim was to move him around the court and make him tired.”Sankar, who was a former junior World No. 1, lacked consistency in the 2024 season due to various reasons. However, he started the 2025 season on a bright note, reaching the quarterfinals of the Thailand Masters. He was later down with fever and could not give his best in the next few tournaments. However, Sankar recovered well ahead of the Swiss Open.The youngster, who is known for his defensive play, has improved his attacking skills and stroke-making.“My strokes have become sharper than usual, and I am able to finish off points from the rear court. My power is gradually increasing, and I am working on it. There is still a long way to go,” he said.Sankar’s long-time coach Aravindan Samiappan said that the win has come at the right time for his ward.“The moment has not sunk in properly. Sankar was an underdog and had nothing to lose. Our plan was to stay neck-to-neck on points and towards the end anything could have happened. But none would have expected such a scoreline in the decider. It was a bit shocking but that happens sometimes,” Aravindan said.The coach feels that opponents can no longer come prepared for Sankar, as he lends unpredictability into his game now.“Sankar can vary the pace of the match whenever required, and this was not the case one and a half years ago. Players could anticipate what he was going to do, as he played at a single pace. Now, you cannot predict him, and that is the major difference in his gameplay,” pointed out the coach.","Sankar Muthusamy defeated World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12,. 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.

NAGPUR: Malvika Bansod rallied from three points (14-17) down to clinch the first game but as luck would have it the 23-year-old world No.23 missed a chance to save the second match point in the decider to go down fighting against higher ranked Michelle Li of Canada, and bow out of the Swiss Open on Wednesday.Though Malvika suffered an early exit from the BWF World Tour Super 300 tournament, the world No.20 Li escaped to win the opening round contest against the Nagpur shuttler. Malvika lost the 65-minute thrill-a-minute clash 22-20, 14-20, 19-21.For Malvika, it was a heartbreak exit from the $250,000 tournament at Basel, Switzerland. In a neck-and-neck contest, Canada’s Li won a handful of net shots as Malvika made her higher ranked opponent dance to her tunes with various cross court tricks. But the handful of lucky points through the net that Li won proved crucial in the third and deciding game.Later, India No.1 PV Sindhu suffered yet another first round exit when the seventh seeded, world No.17 lost to Julie Jakobsen 17-21, 19-21.In an all Indian contest, Isharani Baruah surprised Aakarshi Kashyap 18-21, 21-17, 22-20 while Anupama Upadhyaya outplayed Anmol Kharab 21-14, 21-13 to enter the second round of the women’s singles event.Earlier, Kidambi Srikanth beat compatriot HS Prannoy 23-21, 23-21 to enter the men’s singles second round.","Malvika Bansod loses to Michelle Li of Canada in first round of Swiss Open.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

Bangladesh World Cup T20 squad:





NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Sunday strongly criticised the BCCI ’s decision to ask Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to release Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman , insisting that sport should remain separate from politics.Speaking to The Indian Express, Tharoor said the move amounted to an unnecessary politicisation of cricket. His comments came after the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) decided against sending its national team to India for the T20 World Cup next month, citing security concerns and government advice. The decision followed KKR’s release of Mustafizur on the BCCI’s instruction.On Sunday, Bangladesh named their squad for the T20 World Cup beginning in February, leaving out middle-order batters Jaker Ali Anik and Mahidul Islam while selecting five fast bowlers. Wicketkeeper-batter Litton Das was named captain for the tournament to be held in India and Sri Lanka, the BCB said.However, the squad announcement also coincided with Dhaka requesting that its four group matches scheduled in India be shifted to Sri Lanka, amid anger over India forcing a Bangladeshi player to quit the Indian Premier League.“I think it’s an absolutely appalling decision by the BCCI. It is an unnecessary politicisation of a sporting decision.And there are various aspects I object to. One is the fact that purely as a cricketing decision, it makes no sense because teams were invited to choose from a registered pool of players selected by the BCCI. So if a fellow was in the pool, why is KKR to blame for selecting somebody from that pool? So, the first question is that it makes no sense to object to the selection of somebody whom the BCCI has submitted to all the teams as an eligible player,” Tharoor told The Indian Express.“Bangladesh is not Pakistan. Bangladesh has not been dispatching terrorists across the border. It’s not a comparable situation at all. And besides, our relationship with the two countries is also different. And the stage of our negotiations or our diplomacy with Bangladesh is different from our relationship with Pakistan. You cannot make a simple equation between the two.“There is also a moral objection I have, which is why is it that sports and cricket alone have to bear the burden of social media outrage? There are so many other ways in which we are interacting with Bangladesh at various levels. But somehow, cricket has to bear this. And one particular player, that player has never condoned hate speech, he has never said anything against India or against the Hindu minority in Bangladesh, he is just a sportsman. Who are we victimising here?“And if we have decided now that the social media outrage will mean that every Bangladeshi cricketer is ineligible to play in India, then what happens if a Bangladeshi Hindu cricketer like Litton Das or Soumya Sarkar — who are good players in Bangladesh and have played in the IPL in the past — if they had been picked this year, would they also have been kicked out? And if not, then what are we signaling? Are we such an intolerant country that we’re against Muslim Bangladeshis and not against Hindu Bangladeshis?“This entire thing has not been thought through at all by anybody who took this reflexive decision, presumably in response to social media outrage. And I find this absolutely preposterous. To my mind, it demeans us as a nation. It demeans our diplomacy. It demeans our bilateral relationship. It demeans our culture as a nation with a broad enough mind and a big enough heart to be able to look at these things in a broader spirit,” he said.Litton Das (captain), Mohammad Saif Hasan, Tanzid Hasan Tamim, Parvez Hossain Emon, Towhid Hridoy, Shamim Hossain, Nurul Hasan Sohan, Mahedi Hasan, Rishad Hossain, Nasum Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Taskin Ahmed, Mohammad Shaifuddin, Shoriful Islam.",Congress MP Shashi Tharoor criticises BCCI's decision to ask Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to release Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman.

Excerpts...

You trace your roots to Chennai — a city which your parents hail from. Do you speak Tamil at home? Do you relish South Indian cuisine? Have you been to, or do you plan to go to Chennai at some point in life?

You’ve joined Delhi Capitals as a replacement player this season. How did the call come through and what was your first reaction when you heard it was DC?

How good are DC's chances of ending their trophy jinx and clinching their maiden WPL title this time?

You have played one WPL match for UP Warriorz last year. As someone who regularly plays in the Women’s Big Bash League, how excited are you about returning to the WPL?

How has the pre-season camp been so far in Goa, and we’re seeing a lot of fun content coming out of the DC camp—how’s the team atmosphere been?

You will be playing for Delhi Capitals under Jemimah Rodrigues, who slammed that match-winning century against Australia. What would you say about that?

Does the World Cup semifinal defeat to India at the DY Patil Stadium still rankle?

Will Australia bounce back from that semifinal defeat?

Is Australia looking to avenge its World Cup semifinal defeat to India when Harmanpreet Kaur & Co tour Australia in Feb-March for a multi-format series?

As a women’s cricketer, what does India’s maiden World Cup triumph mean for the women’s game?

Who is the best batter that you have ever bowled to?

Was Australian leg-spin legend Shane Warne your inspiration while growing up?





NAVI MUMBAI: There are quite a few reasons for Alana King to fall in love with India. The Australian leg-spinner has Indian roots; her parents, Leroy and Sharon, are Anglo-Indians who migrated to Melbourne from Chennai in the 1980s. On October 25, 2025 during a Women's ODI World Cup match in Indore, King delivered a stunning seven-over spell, taking seven for 18 to spin out South Africa for merely 97. These are the best figures in the history of the Women's World Cup. Having gone unsold in the Women’s Premier League (WPL) auction in November, King found a way to play in the lucrative tournament, set to kick off from Jan 9, as the Delhi Capitals picked her up as a replacement for all-rounder Annabel Sutherland, who withdrew due to personal reasons.I don’t speak Tamil, unfortunately. My parents never taught my brother and me because we grew up in Australia and they didn’t think we needed to learn it. But growing up in an Indian household, Indian food was always around, and my dad’s cooking was incredible. I’m very well equipped with Indian food and I absolutely love it — the spice is in my blood. I’ve surprised a few of the girls here because I eat everything and don’t find it spicy at all, and then they automatically think I can speak the language, which I can’t.I’d love to learn a few phrases while I’m here. I haven’t been to Chennai in quite a few years, but I’d love to go back. Cricket brings me to India quite often and hopefully it takes me there again. There’s a multi-format series against India coming up (next year), and if there’s a game in Chennai, that would be really special.It was very exciting. I got the call on Boxing Day night, and I was actually at the Australia–England Test match. My manager rang me and said I was going to India and needed to get back to Perth. I was meant to be with my family for Christmas, and two days later I was on a flight. It was hectic and a bit chaotic getting everything sorted, but I’m very grateful for the opportunity. To be part of the DC family is really exciting, and I’m just happy to be here. ”I hope it’s fourth time lucky (for DC). With every tournament, everyone starts on zero. It’s a new year, there are some fresh faces in the team including myself, and there’s a new captain in Jemimah (Rodrigues). There’s been a little bit of change, and sometimes change is a good thing because it can refresh the group. This team is hungry, excited to start the season, and ready to hit the ground running.It’s something a lot of cricketers want to be part of. To get another opportunity to play in the WPL and to do it with DC is something I’m incredibly grateful for. There’s a great group of support staff and some excellent players. I get to play with internationals I haven’t played with before and also learn from the Indian players in their home conditions. I’m excited to be here and get started.It’s been great. There’s a lot of fun in this team, and the support staff brings a lot of energy. The content team is also a lot of fun, and when the environment is like that, it gives you an extra pep in your step. The girls have been fantastic. I’m still learning everyone’s names, especially the domestic players, but it’s been a really welcoming group. I’m excited to work under Jonathan Batty (DC head coach) and enjoy being part of this setup.She’s been a great player for a long time, and to do that on the biggest stage is something she and her country should be incredibly proud of. It’s nice to finally be on Jemimah’s team instead of being on the receiving end. We’ve played a lot against each other, including Shafali (Verma) as well, so to be on the same side and collaborate together is really refreshing.It was very disappointing as a group. Losing a semifinal always hurts, especially in a World Cup. One game doesn’t define a team, but those games are hard to take. Credit to India—they outplayed us in a really important match and deserved to go on to win the World Cup.This team always reflects and reviews big tournaments, whether we win or lose. We haven’t come together as a group yet because we went straight into the WBBL, but when we do, we’ll look at what we can do better. We can’t dwell on what’s happened. We learn from it, take those learnings forward and focus on what’s ahead.We’ll be playing the world champions, so it’s going to be a massive challenge. India are a huge threat across all formats. It’s an exciting series and one we’re really looking forward to.It’s massive. For India to win a World Cup will do a world of good for the women’s game, not just in India but around the world. Moments like that inspire young girls and help grow the game globally.It’s hard to narrow it down to just one. In recent times, Smriti Mandhana and Nat Sciver-Brunt have probably been the hardest batters to bowl to.During the 2025 ODI Women’s World Cup, you took a historic seven-wicket haul (7/18) against South Africa. Is that the best you have ever bowled?It was pretty special to do it in a World Cup. Everything happened really quickly and I didn’t take it in at the time. I don’t look too much at personal accolades, but it’s something I’m very proud of. To do it on that stage, with my family there, and to put the team in a strong position made it a really special moment.Absolutely. Watching Warne at the MCG was the reason I picked up leg-spin. He made it fun and exciting. Once I understood leg-spin, I stuck with it. I learned a lot from him, especially later through his commentary, and he had a huge influence on my journey.”","Alana King has joined Delhi Capitals as a replacement player this season.

Australia’s assistant coach Daniel Vettori has backed the team’s call to go in with an all-seam attack for the fifth Ashes Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, while making it clear that spin bowling still matters in Test cricket.With senior off-spinner Nathan Lyon ruled out because of a hamstring injury, Australia chose not to play a specialist spinner in Sydney. This marked the first time since 1888 that Australia fielded an all-pace attack at the SCG. It was also the third occasion in the ongoing Ashes series that Australia opted for only fast bowlers.The SCG, once known for surfaces that helped spinners, has in recent years offered more help to seam bowlers.""That's the thing. It's history – it's a long time ago,"" Vettori said, referring to the ground’s past reputation. He pointed out that spinners have averaged 53 across the last three Tests at the venue, and close to 60 when Lyon’s figures are excluded.""You've seen over the last three years it's been diminishing results for spin bowlers here, which is obviously not something that we'd like, but it's the nature of the surface,"" Vettori said.Australia’s position in the series supports the decision. They lead 3-1, and their loss in the two-day Test in Melbourne was not linked to the absence of a spinner.Vettori, who took 362 wickets in 113 Tests for New Zealand, said the recent trend does not mean spin bowling is being pushed aside in the longer format.Australia have gone with an all-seam attack in four of their last six Tests. Two of those matches were pink-ball games in which Lyon was available.""It's probably just a point in time,"" Vettori said. ""I don't think it's going to be something that's going to continue on for years on end.""I think spin bowling is incredibly important to Test match cricket. I think people love watching it when it's at its absolute best and when conditions can assist the spin bowler.""But we're just in the stage now where that's not the case. I wouldn't be surprised that it changed in the future.""I think at some stage it will get back to possibly how it was preceding these last couple of years.""","Daniel Vettori says spin bowling is still important in Test cricket.

BCCI Asks KKR To Release Bangladesh Player From IPL After Outrage Over Attacks On Hindu Minorities

What BCB said







NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Sunday decided that the Bangladesh team will not travel to India for the upcoming T20 World Cup. The decision was taken at a board meeting held on Sunday afternoon.The matter was discussed following Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman ’s exit from the Indian Premier League (IPL). BCB directors had earlier held an online meeting on Saturday night to deliberate on the issue.During that meeting, most directors supported avoiding any firm action. However, after input from the Bangladesh government, the board reconsidered its position and changed its decision.""The Board reviewed the situation in detail, taking into account developments over the last 24 hours and expressed deep concern over the overall circumstances surrounding the participation of the Bangladesh National Team in matches scheduled to be played in India,"" BCB said in a statement.""Following a thorough assessment of the prevailing situation and the growing concerns regarding the safety and security of the Bangladesh contingent in India and considering the advice from the Bangladesh Government, the Board of Directors resolved that the Bangladesh National Team will not travel to India for the tournament under the current conditions,"" the statement added.BCB has also sought a change of venues for its matches. ""In light of this decision, the BCB has formally requested the International Cricket Council (ICC), as the event authority, to consider relocating all of Bangladesh’s matches to a venue outside India,"" the board said.""The Board believes that such a step is necessary to safeguard the safety and well-being of Bangladeshi players, team officials, Board members and other stakeholders and to ensure that the team can participate in the tournament in a secure and appropriate environment. The Bangladesh Cricket Board looks forward to the ICC’s understanding of the situation and an urgent response on this matter,"" the BCB statement read.The development followed Mustafizur Rahman being released by Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) after directions from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), amid diplomatic issues between India and Bangladesh.KKR had signed the 30-year-old left-arm pacer for Rs 9.20 crore at the IPL auction last month. His base price was Rs 2 crore, with Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals also involved in the bidding.The BCCI said KKR would be allowed to name a replacement player if required for the tournament, which begins on March 26.India and Sri Lanka are joint hosts of the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. According to the schedule announced so far, Bangladesh are set to play West Indies in Kolkata on February 7, the opening day of the tournament.Bangladesh’s other three group matches are also scheduled in Kolkata and Mumbai.Earlier on Sunday, the BCB announced a 15-member squad for the World Cup, naming Liton Das as captain.",Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) decides that the team will not travel to India for the upcoming T20 World Cup.

This time, it involves the T20 World Cup and the Indian Premier League.Bangladesh has asked that their matches at next month’s T20 World Cup not be played in India. Instead, they want the games moved to Sri Lanka. The request came after Bangladeshi fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman was released from his IPL team following advice from the BCCI.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor reacted sharply to the development. He took to social media and criticised India’s role in the situation.""Hardly surprising. We have brought this embarrassment upon ourselves,"" Shashi Tharoor wrote on X.The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) held an emergency meeting on Sunday.

He said the country would not tolerate any disrespect.""will not accept any insult to Bangladeshi cricket, cricketers and Bangladesh under any circumstances.""""The days of slavery are over,"" he added.""Where a Bangladeshi cricketer cannot play in India despite being contracted, the entire Bangladeshi cricket team cannot feel safe going to play in the World Cup,"" he wrote.The T20 World Cup begins on February 7 and is co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.

But BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia said that “considering recent developments” the franchise had been “advised to release” him.Nazrul also threatened further action.""I have requested the Information and Broadcasting Adviser to stop the broadcasting of the IPL tournament in Bangladesh,"" he said.Kolkata Knight Riders later said Mustafizur’s “release has been carried out following due process and consultations”.The controversy comes at a sensitive time.

Poll Will Mumbai qualify for the knockout stage of the Vijay Hazare Trophy? Yes, they'll win both remaining matches Yes, but will need to win at least one No, they'll miss the knockout stage Unsure, it's too close to call





Even as Mumbai are set to be bolstered by the arrival of India’s ODI vice-captain Shreyas Iyer , T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav and allrounder Shivam Dube in Jaipur, the team has injury concerns heading into their final two league matches of the Vijay Hazare Trophy (VHT).Captain Shardul Thakur and leading batter Sarfaraz Khan both underwent MRI scans on Saturday after picking up injuries, casting a shadow over Mumbai’s campaign at a crucial stage.Placed second in Elite Group C behind table-toppers Punjab, with four wins in five matches and 16 points in their bag, Mumbai must win both—or at least one—of their remaining matches to make it to the knockout stage of the domestic one-day tournament. Following their 128-run defeat to Maharashtra on Saturday, their net run rate (1.293) has taken a significant hit, meaning they also need to improve their NRR.However, ahead of the two crucial games -- against Himachal Pradesh and Punjab—Mumbai have been left sweating over the fitness of their captain Shardul Thakur, who underwent a scan on Saturday following a calf injury.Thakur experienced pain in his calf region and hobbled off while bowling his seventh over (6.5-1-25-0) during Mumbai’s 128-run defeat against Maharashtra in Jaipur on Saturday. While there has been no official word from the Mumbai Cricket Association on Thakur’s injury so far, sources revealed to TOI that the India allrounder is even in danger of missing the rest of the Vijay Hazare Trophy.“Even if he misses the rest of the league games of the VHT, Shardul will stay back in Jaipur and will be monitored regularly by the Mumbai team’s physio. Depending on the result of his scans, a call will be made about his future availability,” a source tracking developments told this paper. Shardul has been Mumbai’s most successful bowler, claiming 11 wickets in five games at 9.54, with best figures of four for 13 against Chhattisgarh and three for 20 against Goa.Meanwhile, in-form batter Sarfaraz, who with 220 runs in three matches at 110.00 has been Mumbai’s top run-getter in the VHT so far, missed Mumbai’s last match against Maharashtra due to pain in his quadriceps. Sarfaraz had suffered a quadriceps injury last year. However, the 28-year-old is likely to return to the XI for Mumbai’s next match against Himachal on Tuesday.",Mumbai have injury concerns heading into their final two league matches of the Vijay Hazare Trophy.

Under the supervision of a court-appointed committee, a tender was issued for the ISL’s commercial rights, but it did not attract any bidders.On Thursday, 13 of the 14 ISL clubs informed the AIFF that they ""may be ready and willing"" to participate in the delayed season if there is no participation fee and if the federation takes responsibility for organisational and operational costs of a shortened tournament.Meanwhile, the AIFF said on Saturday that the start date of the delayed ISL season will be announced next week after the Coordination Committee submitted its report.Following a meeting of its Emergency Committee, the AIFF said it will conduct the league, though clubs had raised concerns earlier.News agency PTI reported that that the AIFF may propose February 15 as the start date for the 2025-26 ISL season.""The AIFF Emergency Committee met today (January 3, 2025) to consider and acknowledge the report submitted by the AIFF-ISL Coordination Committee.

Arsenal fought back from a goal down to beat Bournemouth 3-2 on Saturday, stretching their lead at the top of the Premier League as Aston Villa extended their winning run at home. A goal from Gabriel Magalhaes and two from the returning Declan Rice sent the Gunners six points clear of second-placed Villa and seven ahead of Manchester City.Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta praised the character of his team, singling out Rice and Gabriel, whose sloppy pass set up Bournemouth for the opening goal.""I love the character of Gabriel, the way he overcome that situation -- it's just unbelievable, it says a lot about how much we've grown,"" he told Sky Sports.""The team found a way to beat them and it's a massive win.""The Spaniard said that Rice had worked hard to be available after missing Tuesday's 4-1 home win against Villa with a knee problem.""He has stretched himself to the very limit and the team were awarded with two great goals,"" he added.Evanilson gave impressive Bournemouth an early lead, stroking home after Gabriel's error but the Brazil defender made up for his mistake just minutes later, converting after Noni Madueke's drive to the byline.England midfielder Rice side-footed the Gunners ahead in the 54th minute from the edge of the area and gave them breathing space with about 20 minutes to go, producing a low finish from substitute Bukayo Saka's cutback.Junior Kroupi brought Bournemouth back into the game with a thunderous right-footed finish but Arsenal held on for a fifth straight Premier League win -- keeping them firmly on course for a first English title since 2004.Earlier, Unai Emery's Villa bounced back from their chastening defeat at Arsenal to beat Nottingham Forest 3-1, recording their 11th consecutive home win in all competitions.England forward Ollie Watkins gave Villa a deserved lead on the cusp of half-time with a powerful strike from just outside the area and John McGinn scored twice in the second half, either side of a Morgan Gibbs-White goal.Villa boss Emery said his players and coaching staff had held a meeting after their drubbing at the Emirates Stadium.""I am so happy,"" he said. ""We had to recover our energy and our confidence. Here, at Villa Park, the energy we create was really important.""Forest are competitive.

""It's about actions. It's been very bad, very bad.""Wolves, who drew with Manchester United in midweek, remain 12 points from safety.""We have been improving and progressing and you saw that today,"" Edwards told the BBC. ""It is another step in the right direction, that is all it was and it is nice it has culminated in a win.""Elsewhere on Saturday, Brighton beat Burnley 2-0 to end a six-match winless run, courtesy of goals from Georginio Rutter and Yasin Ayari.City host managerless Chelsea on Saturday while Liverpool and Manchester United are also in action.",Arsenal fight back from a goal down to beat Bournemouth 3-2 on Saturday.

Poll Should Pep Guardiola consider a change in tactics after the frustrating draw? Yes, definitely No, the current tactics will work Only minor adjustments are needed





Manchester City missed the chance to keep pace with Arsenal at the top of the Premier League after being held to a frustrating 0-0 draw by Sunderland on Thursday, as a low-scoring start to 2026 saw three of four New Year’s Day fixtures end without a goal.City now trail league leaders Arsenal by four points after failing to capitalise on the Gunners’ emphatic 4-1 demolition of Aston Villa earlier in the week. Pep Guardiola’s side had won eight straight matches to close out 2025, but were unable to break down a resilient Sunderland team that preserved its unbeaten home record since returning to the top flight.Bernardo Silva thought he had given City an early lead, only for his effort to be ruled out for offside inside the opening six minutes. Despite Sunderland missing six players to the Africa Cup of Nations and centre-back Dan Ballard through injury, the hosts held firm. Goalkeeper Robin Roefs produced a string of fine saves to deny Erling Haaland and Josko Gvardiol, while Savinho blazed over a gilt-edged chance.“It’s a mystery,” Guardiola said. “We created a lot, especially in the second half. We take the point — it’s a long way to go.”Liverpool were also left frustrated after being held to a 0-0 draw by Leeds at Anfield.Reds boss Arne Slot lamented the absence of “individual special moments” as his side struggled without Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak. Leeds thought they had snatched a late winner through Dominic Calvert-Lewin, but his effort was ruled out for a marginal offside, extending their unbeaten run to six games.Tottenham’s attacking woes continued in another goalless draw away to Brentford on Thomas Frank’s return to the club he once guided into the Premier League. Spurs fans vented their frustration late on, chanting “boring, boring Tottenham,” while Frank admitted, “We don’t create enough. We need to keep working on that.”Elsewhere, Crystal Palace’s winless run stretched to six games after a 1-1 draw with Fulham. Jean-Philippe Mateta opened the scoring before Tom Cairney struck a fine equaliser.","Manchester City were held to a frustrating 0-0 draw by Sunderland.

PANAJI: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has given clubs 24 hours to confirm their participation and the preferred format for this season’s Indian Super League (ISL).According to sources, the clubs will respond to AIFF before Thursday’s deadline but at least eight of them will seek additional details pertaining to finances.Without a commercial partner, the toptier clubs are not ready to share added financial burden.“Why should the clubs pay for everything,” asked one official. “The AIFF owns the league but has not yet committed to any financial contribution. The clubs should not solely shoulder the responsibility, particularly at a time when we will not have central revenue share and even sponsorships.”The AIFF’s three-member ISL coordination committee has had five meetings with clubs since last week but there is no confirmation on either the format or whether all 14 of them will take part when the league kicks off next month.“AIFF is required to submit the outcome of these meetings to the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports before Jan 2,” AIFF’s deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan wrote in a letter to club CEOs on Wednesday.The federation has given clubs time till Jan 1 to “confirm participation.”For India to earn an Asian spot, all clubs must play atleast 24 league matches in a season.There’s no time now for a fullfledged league since player contracts, and the season, officially ends May 31.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has given clubs 24 hours to confirm their participation and the preferred format for this season's Indian Super League (ISL) According to sources, the clubs will respond to AIFF before Thursday’s deadline but at least eight of them will seek additional details pertaining to finances.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126282790,imgsize-71846,width-400,resizemode-4/fotball-isl-0101.jpg"
Real Madrid's nightmare deepens as Kylian Mbappe joins growing injury list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/real-madrids-nightmare-deepens-as-kylian-mbappe-joins-growing-injury-list/articleshow/126276004.cms,"Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)





Real Madrid have confirmed that Kylian Mbappe has suffered a sprain to his left knee, dealing a significant setback to their pursuit of La Liga leaders Barcelona. The club issued a statement on Wednesday revealing the diagnosis following medical tests, adding that his condition will be monitored over the coming days.The Spanish giants did not provide a clear timeline for the 27-year-old forward’s return. However, a source close to the France international told AFP that Mbappe is expected to be sidelined for a minimum of three weeks.Mbappe’s injury places his availability in serious doubt for Sunday’s home league fixture against Real Betis, Madrid’s first match after the winter break. Carlo Ancelotti’s side currently sit four points behind Barcelona in the title race. The forward could also miss the Spanish Super Cup semi-final against Atletico Madrid in Saudi Arabia on January 8, along with a league encounter against Levante and a Champions League meeting with his former club Monaco.Real Madrid have not disclosed when or how the injury occurred. Mbappe was involved in full training with the squad on Tuesday before undergoing an MRI scan the following day.The setback comes after an exceptional year for Mbappe.

Alix Earle and Tom Brady fuel romance rumors







Alix Earle is stepping into 2026 with a fresh outlook, embracing new beginnings and unforgettable moments. The social media star and “Dancing with the Stars” alum shared glimpses of her dreamy New Year getaway to St. Barts, where she celebrated with friends and NFL legend Tom Brady. “Rumor has it we’re still dancing,” Earle captioned her Instagram post. “New friends, new memories, and new beginnings to start off the new year :) words can’t describe how amazing this trip was, so grateful to @bgarlinghouse & @taragarlinghouse for hosting us & @managermyles for throwing the best nye party EVER!!!”The 25-year-old influencer’s getaway was star-studded, featuring fellow celebrities like Nina Dobrev, Keleigh, Miles Teller, and new couple Glen Powell and Michelle Randolph. Reports suggest Earle and Brady, 48, shared a special moment away from the larger group during a New Year’s Eve yacht party. “They were at a yacht party and met, and broke off from the larger group, talking for a lot of the night,” an insider told Page Six. This sparks curiosity about a possible romance following Earle’s recent split from Houston Texans wide receiver Braxton Berrios after two years together. Earle opened up about the breakup in a tearful video last month: “This has just been really hard.… It’s not drama. It’s not because he did anything wrong or I did anything wrong. It just didn’t really feel like it was working out, in the moment.”Fans were quick to react to Earle’s Instagram post, with one commenting, “NFL man to NFL daddy,” referencing her ex Berrios and her rumored connection with Brady. Another fan wrote, “Oh she knows exactly what she’s doing.” While Brady hasn’t commented directly on their interactions, he shared a cryptic New Year message on Instagram: “People are not beautiful for how they look or speak. They’re beautiful for how they love, care, and treat others. ”The timing of Earle’s rumored romance coincides with her own new chapter and Brady’s post-divorce life. The former Patriots and Buccaneers quarterback, divorced from supermodel Gisele Bündchen since 2022, is now in his second season as Fox’s lead NFL analyst and co-parents their two children. Meanwhile, Earle appears focused on embracing happiness, surrounded by friends and sparkling memories in paradise, making 2026 a year of exciting possibilities for the young influencer.Also Read: Livvy Dunne’s 1980s-inspired Bills Mafia look turns a freezing Jets game into a viral fashion moment, takes playful jab at Hailee Steinfeld",Alix Earle and Tom Brady are rumored to be dating.

DK Metcalf suspension impact on Steelers playoff hopes







DK Metcalf became the storyline Pittsburgh could not escape, even as the clock ticked toward its biggest game of the year. The Steelers walked into Week 18 knowing their fate rested on a single night, a single rival, and a single missing piece. The AFC North crown sat within reach, yet the player capable of changing the game with one catch was watching from afar. As Sunday Night Football approached, tension followed Pittsburgh everywhere, from the locker room to the city streets.Momentum had already slipped once. A chance to seal the division vanished in Cleveland, where the offense felt flat and predictable. With Baltimore waiting and the postseason hanging in the balance, the absence of Metcalf was not just a lineup change. It was a test of identity. The Steelers now had to prove they could win ugly, win disciplined, and win without their most dangerous playmaker.The suspension that sidelined DK Metcalf traced back to a heated moment in Detroit during Week 16. Near halftime, cameras caught Metcalf engaging with a fan along the sideline, an incident that quickly drew league scrutiny. Although he finished that game with four catches for 42 yards, the consequences arrived the next day.Adam Schefter reported that Metcalf would be suspended for two games, covering both Week 17 against the Browns and the season finale against the Ravens. An appeal followed, but the decision stood. The ruling meant Metcalf’s regular season ended abruptly, leaving Pittsburgh without its most explosive receiver during the most critical stretch.The impact was immediate. Against Cleveland, the Steelers struggled to find rhythm through the air. Without Metcalf commanding extra coverage, passing lanes shrank and big plays disappeared. The 13-6 loss dropped Pittsburgh to 9-7 and reopened the division race. Baltimore, sitting at 8-8, suddenly had a clear path.History offered a reminder of what was missing. When these teams met in Week 14, Metcalf torched the Ravens for 148 yards in a 27-22 Steelers win. This time, Pittsburgh had to face its rival without that advantage, relying instead on defense, discipline, and timely execution.Still, hope remained. A win in Week 18 would not only secure the AFC North but also clear the way for Metcalf’s return on January 5. With Aaron Rodgers under center and a defense ranked 16th on PFSN’s Defense Impact scale, Pittsburgh believed survival could lead to something more. One win would bring DK Metcalf back into the picture, right when the stakes grow even higher.Also Read: Who should win the NFL MVP race between Drake Maye and Matthew Stafford as the regular season ends?",Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver DK Metcalf was suspended for the final two games of the season.

Drake Maye vs. Matthew Stafford NFL MVP race hinges on value, not volume







Drake Maye vs. Matthew Stafford NFL MVP race has turned into the league’s most compelling late-season debate, and it is not driven by hype alone. It is fueled by results, timing, and the uncomfortable truth that value does not always favor reputation. As the regular season closed, two teams locked playoff spots, but only one quarterback reshaped expectations across the league.New England did more than win games. The Patriots changed their ceiling. Los Angeles, meanwhile, followed a familiar script of experience and firepower. Both paths produced wins, but only one forced voters to question old habits. As the postseason approaches, the MVP conversation now rests on impact, not resume.Drake Maye did not enter the season as a favorite, and that reality sharpens his case. At 23, he carried a roster many analysts expected to stall short of contention. Instead, New England claimed the AFC East and secured the No. 2 seed. Maye’s efficiency became his signature. He punished mistakes, protected the ball, and delivered points without excess. His career day against the Jets shifted the betting market because it captured his season in one clean performance.Matthew Stafford’s numbers demand respect. He finished with more yards and touchdowns, and his four-score finale reminded everyone of his arm talent. Still, context matters. Stafford operated behind one of the league’s best offensive lines with elite receiving options. The Rams allowed him to chase production deep into games, even when outcomes were secure. That approach inflated totals but blurred the line between dominance and opportunity.Maye’s case strengthens when the layers come off. He led in efficiency metrics, quarterback rating, and situational control. He often exited games early because the work was done. His supporting cast lacked the star power Stafford enjoyed, yet the results stayed steady. Critics point to schedule strength, but value also reflects execution. Maye mastered what was in front of him every week.The NFL will announce the MVP during NFL Honors on Thursday, February 5, in San Francisco, California. That decision will echo beyond one season. Choosing Stafford rewards longevity and volume. Choosing Maye rewards growth, control, and team transformation. The league says the award honors the most valuable player. In 2025, that definition points clearly to Foxborough.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes’ reaction says it all as Travis Kelce reaches historic milestone against Raiders","Drake Maye vs. Matthew Stafford NFL MVP race hinges on value, not volume.

Bills Mafia got their newest members: Olivia “Livvy” Dunne and boyfriend Paul Skenes. Buffalo has a way of pulling people in, even those whose careers live far from snowy sidelines. When Dunne arrived in Western New York with Skenes, it was not a casual stopover. It was a personal moment shaped by fandom, friendships, and the kind of access few get to see up close. The visit blended sports culture with social media savvy, giving fans a glimpse of how elite athletes connect across leagues.The weekend unfolded ahead of the Bills’ regular-season finale against the Jets, where the couple spent time with quarterback Josh Allen . For Dunne, the trip felt larger than a game day. Her excitement came through instantly online, capturing attention beyond football circles and placing her squarely inside Bills Mafia territory.At the center of the buzz was a simple photo that carried symbolic weight. Skenes and Allen swapped jerseys, Pirates meeting Bills in a quiet but powerful exchange. Dunne summed up the emotion with a line that needed no extra context. “This is my Super Bowl,” she wrote, turning a behind-the-scenes snapshot into a viral moment. The caption framed the visit as a personal milestone rather than a publicity stop.Dunne added her signature humor in a follow-up that resonated just as strongly.Smiling beside Skenes, she looked toward Allen’s inner circle and asked, “This is amazing and all but where’s @haileesteinfeld.” The playful tag nodded to Allen’s wife while reminding fans that the NFL star’s life extends well beyond the field. Allen and Steinfeld, who married last May, later shared that they are expecting their first child, adding warmth to an already personal exchange.The trip did not end in Buffalo. Skenes, fresh off an offseason after winning his first NL Cy Young Award, also explored Ontario, Canada with Dunne. Their relationship has moved quickly since going public in 2023, the same year he became the top overall pick in the MLB draft. His 1.97 ERA in the 2025 season only sharpened the spotlight.For Dunne, stepping into Bills Mafia felt natural. Her presence blended fandom with authenticity, leaving fans wondering if future game days might include her and Steinfeld side by side in Bills gear.

Travis Kelce retirement watch turns historic in Las Vegas







Travis Kelce stood at the center of the NFL conversation as the Kansas City Chiefs walked into Week 18 with far more than a regular-season finale on the line. At 36, with his contract expiring and whispers growing louder, the matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders felt like a moment suspended in time. Fans watched every snap closely, knowing they might be witnessing the final chapter of a legendary career written in red and gold.Kelce did not treat the night like a farewell tour. He played with the same sharp focus that defined his rise, even as questions about his future hovered in the background. After Kansas City’s Christmas Day loss to Denver, he addressed the uncertainty with calm honesty, saying, “Honestly, I’ve just been focused on trying to win football games man. I let that be a decision that I make with my family, friends, the Chiefs organization when the time comes. ” It was a reminder that for Kelce, football still comes first.History met uncertainty midway through the third quarter. With a short five-yard catch, Kelce crossed 13,000 career receiving yards, becoming the fastest tight end in NFL history to reach the mark. The Chiefs marked the moment in real time, posting, “Another height reached 🏹 Congrats, @tkelce!” It was not just another statistic.It was a milestone that placed him alongside Tony Gonzalez and Jason Witten, reached in far fewer games.Even from afar, the moment resonated. Patrick Mahomes, sidelined with a season-ending knee injury, reacted instantly on social media, writing, “13K!” Those two characters carried years of trust, timing, and shared success. Mahomes had spoken weeks earlier about savoring each season with his favorite target, admitting, “Every season I’ve had with (Kelce) these last few years I try to cherish because you never know. ”Kelce’s résumé already reads like a Hall of Fame blueprint. Ten straight seasons with at least 75 receptions. Now the eighth-most receptions in league history. Records that speak to durability as much as dominance. Whether this game marked his final bow remains unanswered. What is clear is that if Kelce chooses to walk away, he leaves having reshaped the tight end position and delivered one last historic moment when it mattered most.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers has millions on the line as Steelers-Ravens clash carries massive AFC North implications","Travis Kelce became the fastest tight end in NFL history to reach 13,000 career receiving yards.

How the injury happened and Vikings’ official statement





The Minnesota Vikings are facing a tense moment in Week 18 as quarterback J.J. McCarthy left the game due to a right-hand injury. The team officially listed him as questionable to return, leaving fans and analysts on edge. With the game still in progress, every snap without McCarthy could change the outcome and his status will likely dictate the Vikings’ offensive strategy for the rest of the matchup. Chiefs and Packers fans alike are keeping an eye on the sideline drama, knowing how pivotal his presence is.McCarthy exited the game in the third quarter after taking a hit that affected his right hand. While he initially tried to continue, it became clear that the injury was limiting his ability to grip and throw the football effectively. This is not the first time McCarthy has dealt with minor injuries this season, but the timing couldn’t be worse, as Week 18 carries playoff implications for Minnesota’s offense and overall momentum.The team officially labeled J.J. McCarthy as questionable to return. NFL insider Adam Schefter confirmed the update, noting that the Vikings are evaluating him on the sideline to determine whether he can safely continue playing.At this point, there’s no indication he will be ruled out, but the situation remains uncertain. Fans should expect updates during the broadcast and from the team’s official channels.McCarthy’s potential absence significantly impacts the Vikings’ offensive plan. Backup quarterbacks may need to step in, forcing play-calling adjustments and changing how the team attacks the defense. Every down becomes crucial, and even a brief absence could swing momentum toward the opposing team. Analysts are noting that the offense could lean more on the run game or short passes if McCarthy cannot return.For now, J.J. McCarthy remains questionable to return, and the Vikings’ fate in Week 18 could hinge on whether he steps back onto the field. Every play matters, and fans are watching closely, hoping their star quarterback can shake off the injury and guide the team in this critical matchup. Updates are expected as the game progresses, keeping the tension high for Vikings Kingdom everywhere.Also read - Travis Kelce arrives in Vegas ahead of Week 18 Chiefs-Raiders showdown amid retirement buzz","Minnesota Vikings quarterback J.J.

Fred Warner’s net worth in 2026

How much does Fred Warner make in 2026?

Also Read:





Fred Warner is presently one of the most prominent players for the San Francisco 49ers. Every year, he leads the defense with the same level of effort and consistency. By 2026, his income shows how valuable he is on the field. He is one of the highest-paid linebackers in the NFL because he has a big contract. People are more and more interested in how much Warner makes and how much his net worth is growing as he becomes more and more successful.By 2026, Fred Warner's net worth is expected to be between $20 million and $25 million. This is a huge jump from what people thought earlier in his career. This growth is mostly due to his NFL contracts, which pay him a lot of money. They have made him one of the highest-paid defensive players in the league.Warner's wealth skyrocketed when he got a lot better when he signed a three-year extension in 2025 that modified the terms of his current deal and kept him with the San Francisco 49ers until the end of the 2029 season. The agreement brought his average yearly pay up to $21 million, making him the highest-paid linebacker in the league, ahead of Roquan Smith.Depending on bonuses and incentives that come up over the year, Warner is likely to receive between $20 and $22 million during the 2026 NFL season. He gets a base income, signing bonuses that are paid out over the course of his contract, and roster bonuses that are part of his long-term deal. Warner will have made more than $155 million in his career by then, as long as he doesn't miss any large incentives or restructures.This is a lot of money because Warner has already made more than $65 million from his first major extension and rookie contract. With the most recent deal, it's almost inevitable that he will more than double that amount by the end of his current contract.One of the most important components of Warner's arrangement is security. Reports claim that his most recent deal comes with roughly $56 million in guarantees. This means that he will be financially comfortable for a long time, even if he gets hurt or doesn't play well. That kind of protection is one-of-a-kind and helpful for a linebacker, a position known for getting wounded a lot.Warner doesn't get quarterback-level endorsement money, but he has quietly built up a good portfolio outside of football. He has worked with companies including Nike, Levi's, BodyArmor, Dick's Sporting Goods, and EA Sports, which has given him a steady supplemental stream of income. These sponsorships don't add much to his net worth, but they do provide him a steady presence.","By 2026, Fred Warner's net worth is expected to be between $20 million and $25 million.

What Myles Garrett Needed Entering Week 18

Why This Still Feels Like a Legacy Moment





The number was clear before kickoff. One sack. That’s all Myles Garrett needed to break the NFL ’s single-season sack record and stand alone in history. As Week 18 unfolds, that number hasn’t changed but the clock has. With every passing snap, the pressure isn’t just on the quarterback anymore. It’s on time itself, turning Garrett’s pursuit of history into one of the most tense storylines of the entire NFL season.Myles Garrett entered the final game of the regular season with 22 sacks, putting him just one sack away from surpassing the NFL single-season record currently shared by Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt. Opportunities like this are rare, and for Garrett, this game represents his final chance this season to reach that historic mark.Being this close already places him in elite company. Very few defenders have ever pushed the record to this point, let alone carried the chase into the final week of the season.As the game has progressed, opposing protection schemes have made one thing clear: stopping Garrett has been the priority. Quick throws, extra blockers, and protection sliding heavily in his direction have limited clean pass-rushing opportunities.There haven’t been many long dropbacks. Quarterbacks have made fast decisions. And when Garrett has gotten close, the ball has often been gone just in time. It’s the kind of game flow that quietly works against sack totals, even when the pressure is constant.Even without the record-breaking sack yet, Garrett’s impact is impossible to miss. Entire offensive game plans have revolved around avoiding him. His presence alone has dictated play calls, timing, and protection adjustments.That’s the part the stat sheet doesn’t fully show. Being one sack away from history while still commanding this level of attention speaks to just how dominant his season has been. Record or not, Garrett has forced offenses to play a different brand of football all year.Now, the storyline is simple and brutal. The sack is still possible but time is shrinking. Every remaining defensive snap carries weight. Every third-and-long feels like a potential moment that could flip the season into history.If it happens, it will come late. And if it doesn’t, the chase itself will still be remembered as one of the most gripping defensive pursuits the league has seen in years.Myles Garrett is still one sack away from rewriting the record books. As Week 18 winds down, history remains within reach but it’s no longer guaranteed.Also read - Is Taylor Swift attending Chiefs vs. Raiders?

De'Von Achane injury update: Latest on Dolphins RB’s playing status for Week 18,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/devon-achane-injury-update-latest-on-dolphins-rbs-playing-status-for-week-18/articleshow/126336634.cms,"Image via IMAGN

Will De’Von Achane play in Week 18?

What does this mean for the Dolphins in Week 18?

Also Read:





The Miami Dolphins head into Week 18 with little left to play for, and that reality is shaping several key injury decisions none bigger than the status of star running back De'Von Achane. As Miami prepares to face the New England Patriots in the regular-season finale, all signs point toward Achane sitting out the game.As of now, Achane is not expected to play in Week 18. The Dolphins listed the second-year running back as doubtful on the final injury report after he failed to practice all week due to a shoulder injury. Historically, players carrying the doubtful tag rarely suit up, and head coach Mike McDaniel all but confirmed that trend when speaking to reporters.McDaniel acknowledged that Achane never progressed enough during the week to justify game action, noting that players who do not practice especially on Friday typically do not play. With Miami already eliminated from playoff contention, the coaching staff has little incentive to push one of the franchise’s most valuable young players into a meaningless game.Achane picked up the shoulder injury late in the season after staying remarkably healthy throughout most of 2025.Given his explosive, high-contact running style, Miami appears focused on caution rather than risk. There is no indication the injury is long-term, but the Dolphins clearly prefer to allow full recovery heading into the offseason.Achane was one of the few consistent bright spots in a disappointing Dolphins campaign. He finished the season with 1,350 rushing yards and eight touchdowns, while also adding 67 receptions for 488 yards and four scores through the air. His versatility and speed made him the engine of Miami’s offense, even as quarterback instability and injuries around him stalled the unit.Protecting Achane now ensures he enters the offseason healthy as a priority as Miami looks toward a reset in 2026.With Achane sidelined, the Dolphins are expected to lean on Jaylen Wright as the primary ball carrier, with Ollie Gordon II and Donovan Edwards rotating in support roles. Wright has flashed big-play ability in recent weeks and should see the bulk of the workload against New England, though expectations remain tempered given Miami’s depleted offense.Barring a late and highly unlikely change, De’Von Achane’s 2025 season is effectively over. While Dolphins fans won’t see their breakout star one last time in Week 18, the bigger picture favors caution. Achane has already proven he can be a foundational piece now the focus shifts to ensuring he’s fully healthy and ready to lead Miami’s offense next season.",Miami Dolphins running back De’Von Achane is not expected to play in Week 18.

Cameron Jordan car collection: Inside the New Orleans Saints star’s luxury garage featuring Range Rover and Mercedes models,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/cameron-jordan-car-collection-inside-the-new-orleans-saints-stars-luxury-garage-featuring-range-rover-and-mercedes-models/articleshow/126332868.cms,"Cameron Jordan car collection revealed.Image via: Getty

Cameron Jordan's garage is built for comfort, not attention







Cameron Jordan has been one of the NFL’s most reliable defensive players for over a decade now. The New Orleans Saints star is known for his consistency, leadership, and durability. Over seasons, he has shown up and delivered. Away from football, though, Jordan lives a much calmer and more private life. That balance is reflected clearly in his choice of cars. Jordan’s car collection is not built for attention or social media. It’s built for comfort. He isn’t someone who posts his garage online or turns his lifestyle into content. Instead, the vehicles linked to him over the years suggest a preference for space, ease, and subtle luxury rather than flash.Most of the cars associated with Jordan are luxury SUVs, including Range Rover–style vehicles. These choices make perfect sense for a player of his size and experience because the SUVs offer space, a smooth ride, and a premium feel without being too in-your-face. They work really well for daily commute and match his low-key personality. For an NFL veteran, comfort matters more than anything else and these vehicles are perfect for it.Unlike many NFL stars, Jordan does not appear to chase supercars or rare exotic builds. There’s no sign of a huge collection filled with high-maintenance vehicles or constant upgrades. His garage is quite practical, focusing mostly on long-term comfort rather than trends. Jordan’s steady NFL earnings let him enjoy luxury without going too far. Even with high-end brands, the focus stays on comfort and privacy, not attention. What stands out most is that his car collection seems quite personal, with no extra branding push or constant posting in the era of social media capital. No attempt to turn his garage into a statement. His cars feel chosen for his lifestyle, not for attention.Jordan has also been linked to Mercedes-Benz models, including G-Class-style SUVs and S-Class-type sedans. These choices show his preference for comfort over speed, with quiet cabins and relaxed driving that suit the demands of professional football. These are not cars meant to impress strangers. They are meant to make everyday life easier.Much like his football career, Jordan’s approach to cars is simple and consistent. Reliable. Comfortable. Built to last. His garage reflects the same qualities that have kept him relevant in the NFL for more than a decade: steady performance, smart decisions and confidence.Also read: Maxx Crosby car collection: Porsche, Rolls-Royce Wraith, and Tesla Cybertruck owned by one of the highest-paid non-QBs in NFL history","Cameron Jordan has been one of the NFL’s most reliable defensive players for over a decade now.

Michael Jordan confirms it wasn’t a dunk



One pose helped Michael Jordan build an empire





In the pantheon of global branding, few logos are as instantly recognizable as the silhouette of Michael Jordan soaring through the air. Yet, the ""Jumpman"" wasn't born from a game-winning dunk or a professional highlight reel. Instead, it was the result born out of a combination of basketball and dance.Yes, everyone’s beloved “Air Jordan” is not a pose of Jordan dunking but an instruction by a photographer to mimic a graceful dance move inspired by ballet.During an interview with the Hoop Magazine in 1997, Michael Jordan revealed that the jumpman logo wasn’t what people thought it was: him dunking. He said, ""I wasn't even dunking on that one.""People think that I was. I just stood on the floor, jumped up, and spread my legs, and they took the picture. I wasn't even running. Actually, it was a ballet move where I jumped up and spread my legs. And I was holding the ball in my left hand. ""The story begins in 1984, before Jordan had even played a minute in NBA. Photographer Jacobus Rentmeester was commissioned by Life magazine to capture the stars of the upcoming U.S.Olympic team. Rather than having Jordan perform a standard power dunk, Rentmeester asked him to execute a grand jeté, a ballet leap.On a grassy hill at the University of North Carolina, Jordan jumped straight up, splayed his legs wide, and held the ball in his left hand. It was a pose completely unnatural to his actual playing style, but the camera loved it. When Nike saw the photo, they knew they had found their visual north star. They eventually staged their own version of the shoot with MJ in Chicago Bulls gear, with the city skyline in the background, to create the high-resolution image that would become the logo.While Peter Moore designed the initial Wings logo for the Air Jordan 1, it wasn't until the Air Jordan 3 in 1988 that the Jumpman made its official debut on the tongue of the shoe. Designer Tinker Hatfield made the bold choice to favor this silhouette, signaling that Michael Jordan was a brand in himself. What makes the logo authentic is that it captures the feeling of flight rather than the mechanics of it and makes believe that the #23 jersey flies on the court.It was believed that only 3 million pairs of the shoes would sell in the first year of its release, but $126 million pairs were sold. Michael Jordan’s five-year, $2.5 million deal with Nike in 1984 has evolved into a benchmark that each NBA player dreams of. In 2024 alone, the Jordan brand has generated an estimated $7 billion in sales. Michael Jordan set such a high tone with his sneaker, logo, and branding that the fan craze is still unbeatable to this day.Also read: Magic Johnson and Cookie Johnson’s combined net worth in 2025: NBA power couple’s career earnings, endors","Michael Jordan confirms it wasn’t a dunk that inspired the Air Jordan logo.

Stephen Curry’s explosive return and the “Dunk” debate



Curry’s performance helped Warriors overcome Draymond Green’s ejection







The Golden State Warriors secured a resilient 123-114 victory over the Utah Jazz on Saturday night, but the post-game chatter centered on a rare moment from Stephen Curry. Returning to the lineup at Chase Center after missing a game with a sore left ankle, the 37-year-old superstar finished with a team-high 31 points. However, it was a second-half backdoor cut and a contested finish at the rim that prompted Curry to jokingly ask his teammates, “Did I dunk it?” after the play appeared to be a mix between a high-release layup and a rim-grazing slam.The highlight in question occurred during a third-quarter surge that saw the Warriors erase a double-digit deficit. Curry, known more for his ""gravity"" and long-range shooting than his leaping ability, rose for a transition basket that had the Warriors' bench on its feet. The way Curry stood and looked at his hands after the shot screamed, “Did I just dunk?”During the post-game conference, a reporter asked Curry, “So in that third quarter, after 17 years in the league, does that count for you as a dunk at this stage in your career?”To which Curry gave a very candid reply, “I was joking with the whole bench because last year in Philly, I said that was my last dunk. And then I surprised myself when I got in the air that I was high enough and then I made my mind up at the end. I was gonna try to turn it over, so I'm gonna count it, just because who knows how many chances I get, but I'll have to ask the locker room if they agree with me or not.”Well, the locker room and the Warriors fans will agree, as they say, be happy with what you get, even if it's a layup wrapped up like a dunk.The victory was not without drama, as the Warriors had to play the final 26 minutes without their defensive anchor, Draymond Green, who was ejected late in the second quarter after receiving two quick technical fouls for arguing a non-call with official Kevin Cutler.With the short clock stopped at 2:25, Green was ejected while the Jazz got a chance to push the score to 60-48, a 12-point lead, their largest of the night.Golden State responded with a 10-5 run to close the half-time and dominated the third quarter 42-31. Stephen Curry’s 31 points, 8 from the field with 6 being from the arc, proved to be crucial for Warriors' win over Jazz 123-114. With a 19-12 record, Warriors next stop is the Intuit Dome, Inglewood.Also read: LeBron James vs Stephen Curry net worth: Total earnings, salary, and more","Golden State Warriors defeated Utah Jazz 123-114 on Saturday night.

Y’all have a job.

The Indiana Pacers received another difficult development as injuries continue to hamper their season. Bennedict Mathurin, one of the team’s most productive scorers, will remain sidelined with no clear return date. The update adds further strain to a roster already stretched thin.

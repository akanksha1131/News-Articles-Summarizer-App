Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Rohit Sharma's troubles mount with another cheap dismissal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/rohit-sharmas-troubles-mount-with-another-cheap-dismissal/articleshow/116416443.cms,"Rohit Sharma after his dismissal at The Gabba on Tuesday.

KL Rahul Press Conference

BRISBANE: There's no easy way to couch the issue. Captain Rohit Sharma 's Test career stands at the crossroads in this mid-point of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series. It is imperative for India that he recovers some batting form in the remainder of the series.The image of a disappointed Rohit trudging back, after yet another cheap dismissal, has been a constant feature since the Adelaide Test. To complicate matters, Rohit has given up his usual batting position. KL Rahul 's extraordinarily disciplined effort at the Gabba on Tuesday, to back up a match-winning effort in Perth, means the opening slot is now his.Asking Rahul to give up opening now, just because it was meant to be a stop-gap arrangement, will be unfair on current form and detrimental to the team's interests.Rohit, who is above all a team man, must now reshape his approach and technique to suit the middle-order, where he is likely to bat in the immediate future. Having to do so in the heat of a hard-fought series in Australia, complicates matters for the 37-year-old Rohit.Having joined the team just a few days before the pink-ball Test, Rohit's poor returns in Adelaide were disruptive but could be explained away. Here, in the third Test, with the team in dire straits, he was expected to rediscover some semblance of his old self on Tuesday.Instead, counterpart Pat Cummins exposed his frailties, baiting him with a fuller delivery which Rohit, whose footwork was never his strong suit, reached out for and promptly edged to Alex Carey behind the stumps.When play began, Rohit was yet to open his account and Cummins applied the pressure with three slips, two gullies and a forward short leg. Rohit began well, showed he was amenable to leaving deliveries, and got off the mark against Starc in the next over with a single towards the cover region. Cummins, though, troubled him, in spite of the batter hitting a cracking four behind square off a loose delivery.Australia's pacer-captain clearly had a separate plan for Rahul and Rohit. To Rohit he began the next over slightly fuller, bowling in the channel in the good length area, before unleashing a short one down leg which pushed Rohit on the backfoot and deep inside his crease, the batter shaping up for the pull and missing. The third ball was fuller again and Rohit lunged forward, just that the front foot didn't move further enough to cover the line of the ball. Another loose shot, and out for 10.Rohit fumed off, throwing his gloves in front of the dugout to fuel some intense social-media speculation. The gloves just lay there in the open, deep into India's innings, until a member of the support staff picked them up.It was the sixth time in 12 innings that Cummins had dismissed Rohit, sparking de bate over whether the team, already struggling as a batting unit, could afford to carry him for the remaining two Tests.Without mentioning Rohit or anyone in particular, Rahul, when asked about the batting unit's plans for a turnaround, said, ""I'm quite certain that everybody has their own set plans. The only thing you can do in the first 30 overs is to tighten up your defence. Try and respect that the first 30 overs is the bowler's time and give them their time, leave balls, try and play as tight as possible and then really try to cash in once the ball gets older. So that's my plan, and that's pretty simple. I'm sure that's the plan for everybody.""In Rohit's case, the numbers tell the story. He is averaging less than 20 (19.66) in his last 9 Tests.The pressure to score has seemed to scramble his captaincy at times, as Ian Chappell has noted. Ravi Shastri criticized his field placements when Travis Head was on the rampage. The likes of Ricky Ponting and Cheteshwar Pujara have pointed out why Rohit is a natural opener who needs to return to the top of the order.On Tuesday, Rohit's gloves, lying there under the gloomy Queensland skies, was a pointer to his troubles.","Rohit Sharma's Test career stands at the crossroads in this mid-point of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.

Jasprit Bumrah 'the batter' walks the talk after his batting skills doubted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/jasprit-bumrah-the-batter-walks-the-talk-after-his-batting-skills-doubted/articleshow/116401256.cms,"KL Rahul Press Conference

NEW DELHI: ""You are questioning my batting ability,"" Jasprit Bumrah might have jokingly answered a journalist query, but the India pace spearhead showed that besides being a top-ranked Test bowler, he also possesses what it takes to be a batter, especially in crunch situations.""Hi, Jasprit. What is your assessment of the batting, although you are not the best person to answer the question, but what do you think about the situation of the team, considering the conditions in Gabba?,"" journalist asked after the third day of the third Test in Brisbane.""It's an interesting question. But, you are questioning my batting ability. You should use Google and see who has got the most number of runs in a Test over. But, jokes apart. That's another story,"" Bumrah gave journalist a reality check on Monday.Bumrah reminded everyone of his unique achievement as a batter: holding the record for the most runs scored in a single over in Test cricket - 35 runs off Stuart Broad On the penultimate day of the Brisbane Test, when India's top order crumbled like a pack of cards, Bumrah ensured to walk the talk, rising to the occasion to bail India out of a precarious position.India found themselves in deep trouble, reeling at 213/9 and needing another 33 runs to avoid the follow-on. However, what followed reflected that Bumrah can also excel with the bat when the team needs him the most.Bumrah frustrated Australia's star-studded bowling attack with his dogged resistance, holding his nerve to help India avert the follow-on, as they finished the day's play at 252/9 still 193 runs behind Australia's first innings 445.Bumrah forged a resilient 39-run partnership for the 10th-wicket with Akash Deep which is the highest 10th-wicket stand for India at the Gabba and the second-highest last-wicket partnership overseas since 2020. Interestingly, Bumrah was also part of the biggest one - a 50-run stand with Mohammed Siraj against England.Bumrah displayed a strong defensive technique during the last hour of play, effectively handling both fast bowlers and spin deliveries with assurance.The highlight of his unbeaten 10 off 27 balls was a six, where he pulled Australian captain Pat Cummins over fine leg. However, Bumrah played second fiddle to Akash Deep, who entertained everyone with an unbeaten 27 off 31 balls, including two fours and a six.Bumrah has scored 310 runs in 43 matches at a modest average of 7.20, but these numbers don't reflect the importance of the crucial cameos he plays for the team.",Jasprit Bumrah holds record for most runs scored in a single over in Test cricket.

After dropping KL Rahul on his overnight score of 33, Steve Smith came up with a one-handed blinder in the slips to deny the Indian opener a well-deserved century after leading India's fight on day four of the Brisbane Test at the Gabba .Tuesday got off to a dramatic start when Rahul edged Pat Cummins on the first ball of the day but heaved a sigh of relief to see Smith dropping a sitter at second slip.It cost Australia as Rahul added another 51 runs to his and India's score before he tried to cut off-spinner Nathan Lyon off while rocking back on a length delivery and got a thick outside edge that looked like flying past Smith's outstretched right arm before it stuck in his palm.It ended Rahul's knock of 84 and his 67-run partnership with Ravindra Jadeja.India started the day at a precarious 51 for 4 in reply to Australia's first innings total of 445, which included centuries from Travis Head (152) and Smith (101).It soon became 74 for 5 after captain Rohit Sharma (10) fell early in the day, edging Cummins to wicketkeeper Alex Carey.Conditions at the Gabba remained overcast, and the first session on Tuesday saw rain interrupting play briefly.The five-Test Border Gavaskar Trophy is level at 1-1.",KL Rahul dropped by Steve Smith on 33 on day four of the Brisbane Test.

Former Indian cricket coach Ravi Shastri has publicly supported former England cricketer Isa Guha following her apology for a comment made during the third Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test match at The Gabba. Guha’s comment sparked discussions about unconscious bias and cultural sensitivity in sports commentary.Shastri expressed his support for Guha during a Fox Cricket broadcast.“Brave woman. To do it on live television and apologise takes some steel, and you heard it from the horse’s mouth. As far as I’m concerned, game over. People are entitled to make mistakes—we are all human—and in the heat of the moment, like you saw with the Siraj incident with Travis Head , sometimes, when you have a mic in your hand, things can happen. But to own up, to put your hand up and say, ‘I’m sorry if things have gone out of place,’ takes courage. She’s done it, so let’s move on.”Ravi Shastri’s supportive comments emphasised the need for understanding and forgiveness in such situations. His statement suggested that acknowledging and apologising for a mistake is a crucial step towards moving forward.The incident occurred on Sunday when Guha, responding to Brett Lee ’s praise of Jasprit Bumrah ’s bowling performance, referred to Bumrah as the “MVP—Most Valuable Primate.”Guha’s intention was to highlight Bumrah’s significant contributions as India’s leading bowler in a challenging match. However, the use of the word “primate” generated controversy.Guha subsequently issued an apology for her choice of words.“Yesterday in commentary, I used a word that can be interpreted in a number of different ways. I’d like to apologise for any offence caused. I set myself really high standards when it comes to empathy and respect for others,” said Guha.She clarified her intent and expressed regret for her phrasing.“If you listen to the full transcript, I only meant the highest praise for one of India’s greatest players—someone I admire greatly. I’m an advocate for equality and someone who has spent their career thinking about inclusion and understanding in the game,” she added.Guha further explained her background and stressed the absence of any malice in her comment. She also expressed hope that the incident would not overshadow the ongoing Test match.“I was trying to frame the enormity of his achievement and I’ve chosen the wrong word. For that, I am deeply sorry. As someone who is also of South Asian heritage, I hope people will recognise that there was no other intention or malice, and I hope this hasn’t overshadowed what has been a great Test match so far. I look forward to seeing how it progresses.”The incident has reignited discussions about responsible commentary and the significance of cultural sensitivity in sports broadcasting.

Virat Kohli is one of the greatest players ever: Mitch Marsh

We as a team are going through transition: Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: Legendary Sunil Gavaskar voiced his anger over the shot selection of Shubman Gill in the first innings of the third Test in Brisbane on Monday. The former India captain urged Gill to ‘leave your image in the dressing room’ and put the fancy shots in his 'back pocket'.Gill chased a delivery outside off stump, playing it away from his body, resulting in an outside edge. Mitchell Marsh pulled off a brilliant catch at gully off Mitchell Starc's bowling.""Leave your image in the dressing room,"" Gavaskar said on Star Sports.""Certain shots are dangerous at the start of your innings before you are set, and you don't have the measure of what the wicket is doing. Keep all those shots in your back pocket. Take them out when you are 30-40-50 not out, then can you get those shots again,"" Gavaskar said.""Not very good shot selection, you could say. It was a very good catch, so there was a little bit of bad luck as well over there. But he could have left that ball alone; it would have gone harmlessly to the wicketkeeper,"" he further added.Gavaskar also urged Virat Kohli to take inspiration from Sachin Tendulkar 's iconic 241 against Australia in Sydney in 2004, advising him to avoid playing the cover drive to overcome his ongoing struggles with deliveries outside the off-stump.""He (Kohli) only needs to look at his hero, Sachin Tendulkar. The way in which he (Tendulkar) had kept his patience and control on his off-side game, scoring those 241 runs at Sydney,"" Gavaskar told Star Sports.Kohli suffered yet another failure as Josh Hazlewood dismissed him for 3, leaving a struggling India at 51 for 4 at stumps on Day 3, trailing by 394 runs.",Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar voiced his anger over the shot selection of Shubman Gill in the first innings of the third Test in Brisbane.

In the high-pressure crucible of the World Chess Championship , it wasn’t just the brilliance of D Gukesh ’s moves that left an indelible mark – it was his unwavering poise under tense situations that etched an unforgettable impression. The 18-year-old prodigy played not only with his mind but also with his heart, fighting every battle as though the board was a stage and he, the lead actor in a drama of unyielding resolve.Yet, it was his demeanour, as much as his daring, that caught the attention of those who observed him up close. Aleksandar Colovic, the Fair Play Officer of the blue-ribbon event tasked with ensuring the tournament’s integrity, noted that his job was made easier because of how well-behaved both Gukesh and former champion Ding Liren were.“They are very similar in many ways – both cultured and well-mannered. They both shook their legs when nervous, but in different ways. They were also very cooperative and kind. True gentlemen,” Aleksandar told TOI.In a world where chess geniuses often arrive wrapped in eccentricity, the Chennai teen has stood apart. Even in moments of extreme pressure, Gukesh maintained an aura of focus. Aleksandar, who observed every move with the precision of a hawk, quickly identified the quality that set Gukesh apart.“Actually, I was really impressed by Gukesh’s constant desire to put up a fight. I think Garry Kasparov or someone had said, ‘In a match between two players, the fighter always wins.’ Gukesh was the better fighter in this tournament. If you look at the games, when Ding was playing with the white pieces, he often avoided a fight. He wanted to be safe – wanted a draw.""But Gukesh wasn’t doing that. He took it to the extreme, avoiding a draw even in positions where he was objectively worse. This characteristic of being a true fighter, not shying away from a challenge, was the main difference that decided the champion,” said Aleksandar, a seasoned Fair Play Officer with extensive experience in events like the Grand Prix and the Candidates Tournament.After the victory, Gukesh praised his 32-year-old opponent, calling him a “true champion” and expressing his admiration. “I would also love to thank my opponent, Ding Liren. He is, in my eyes, a true champion, and we saw that despite a lot of pressure on him, he was able to put up a huge fight. I really admire you,” Gukesh said during the closing ceremony. This graciousness, especially at just 18, added to the impression of a young champion defined not only by his moves but also by his character.Meanwhile, Russian Chess Federation president Andrei Filatov has questioned the way Ding lost to Gukesh, calling for an investigation by FIDE . In response, Aleksandar remarked, “That blunder didn’t come out of nowhere. I mean, this was a long, gruelling game where Gukesh was pressing and pushing, while Ding just wanted the game to end. He was a few moves away, thinking nothing could go wrong, but then he messed up. After almost a month of constant pressure, people crack. That’s normal.”The officer’s role in the tournament was both challenging and rewarding, especially in an era where technology has blurred the lines of fair play. “Players were scanned before entering the play area, passing through different types of scanners to ensure they didn’t have any devices on them or their body. I also ensured no signals entered the glass cube. I really enjoyed it. I knew that maybe I’m becoming part of history here,” Aleksandar explained.","D Gukesh beat Ding Liren to win the World Chess Championship. The 18-year-old prodigy played not only with his mind but also with his heart. Aleksandar Colovic, the Fair Play Officer of the blue-ribbon event, noted that his job was made easier because of how well-behaved both players were.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116330003,imgsize-39352,width-400,resizemode-4/116330003.jpg"

Christmas came early to the Indian dressing room on Tuesday at the Gabba , which witnessed euphoric scenes minutes before close of play on day four of the third Test in Brisbane . India legends Virat Kohli , captain Rohit Sharma and chief coach Gautam Gambhir erupted in joy as soon as Akash Deep hit the boundary that ensured the visitors have saved the follow-on and potentially the third Test as well.An unbeaten 39-run partnership of 54 balls for the last wicket between Akash Deep (27*) and Jasprit Bumrah (10*) helped India go past the follow-on target of 246 to finish day four at 252 for 9. Although India still trail the home team's total of 445 by 193 runs, saving the follow-on has almost decisively moved the match towards a draw as Australia will have to bat now in their second innings on day five.But the scenes that went viral on Tuesday were of Kohli, Rohit and Gambhir doing the high fives and laughing heartily to watch Bumrah and Akash destroying Australia's hopes. The ninth wicket fell at the score of 213, when Jadeja was dismissed for a possibly match-saving knock of 77.The most important play of day four came in the last hour. At one stage where Australia were hoping that they could dismiss India, enforce the follow-on and bowl a few overs at the Indian openers before close of play, the visitors went to stumps with still a wicket in hand -- thanks to Bumrah, Akash and Jadeja.KL Rahul remains the top-scorer of India's first innings with his knock of 84.Both Bumrah and Akash showed exemplary display of copybook defence and game-awareness to milk the Australian bowlers with ones and twos and move closer to the follow-on target of 246. Once that was achieved, Akash showed his long-handle skills by hitting Pat Cummins for a six over mid-wicket.The shot brought Kohli on his feet as he ran right up to the glass window at the edge of the dressing room to see how far the ball travelled, while the rest of his teammates applauded with wide smiles on their faces.The importance of this match-saving act is such that it can potentially turn into a turning point in the series that will next move to Melbourne and then to Sydney for the concluding Test -- two venues that should favour the Indian batters more than Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane.","Akash Deep (27) and Jasprit Bumrah (10) help India go past the follow-on target of 246. India legends Virat Kohli, captain Rohit Sharma and chief coach Gautam Gambhir erupted in joy as soon as Akash Deep hit the boundary. India still trail the home team's total of 445 by 193 runs. Australia will have to bat now on day five.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116394174,imgsize-23768,width-400,resizemode-4/116394174.jpg"

Who could replace Rohit Sharma as Team India's captain in Tests?

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma has faced intense criticism following India's disappointing performance in the ongoing third Test against Australia at The Gabba.With Australia cruising at the moment, the pressure has continued to mount on the Indian captain, especially after a difficult Sunday, leaving fans frustrated and vocal about his decisions.India won the toss on Saturday and opted to field, a decision that has sparked widespread bitterness.Fans online were quick to express their dissatisfaction, with some arguing that India should have batted first instead of bowling on a pitch that allowed Australia’s openers to settle in comfortably.The frustration has boiled over, and numerous calls for Rohit's resignation have flooded social media platforms.One fan on X, formerly Twitter, expressed their dismay, writing, “He's just not meant for this job, he needs to accept it and resign immediately after this Test irrespective of the outcome of this match.”The sentiment was echoed by others, with another stating, “Rohit Sharma is on the verge of losing five consecutive Tests. We need to start a serious discussion about his captaincy now, and also sack Gambhir for the betterment of Indian cricket .”Rohit's leadership has been scrutinised during this match, with India struggling to capitalise on key moments in the field.The bowlers, such as Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, have fought hard, but Australia’s top order, led by Travis Head and Steve Smith , has managed to dominate the proceedings.""Look, I mean, today, I thought Akash Deep bowled really well. He bowled his heart out, as did Siraj. You know, Siraj struggled with cramps early in the day, but for him to keep running in, especially late in the day, and deliver short balls and that new-ball spell was great to see,"" bowling coach Morne Morkel said at the end of Day 2.The Australian batters' ability to bat through 80 overs, with steady contributions from both Head and Smith, has only added to the mounting criticism of India's tactical decisions.As the match progresses, India are on the backfoot, and many fans are questioning whether Rohit can handle the mounting pressure.","Rohit Sharma has faced intense criticism following India's disappointing performance in the ongoing third Test against Australia at The Gabba.

We as a team are going through transition: Jasprit Bumrah

Virat Kohli during the net session.

BRISBANE: The sun was out in its full glory and it was a very hot morning in Brisbane before Day 4 got underway. The forecast apps had maintained consensus on rain but the morning didn't suggest that the day would be headed in that direction. As the handful of spectators made their way to The Gabba, there was a lot of noise coming from the nets area. Few Indian training jerseys were spotted from the main junction but the moment one got closer, the cast of the session was revealed.With the training tank top on, Virat Kohli was in the nets and faced a lot of deliveries from Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar and the throwdown specialists. The India batter kept switching nets for small hits against different attacks as he looked to iron out the flaws which have been leading to his downfalls in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy .In the first innings at Gabba, the right-hander was out nicking at a delivery well outside the off-stump and chatter of his vulnerabilities in that channel only grew louder. So, here he was, on the morning of the fourth day, sweating out as few spectators observed proceedings from a higher elevation and some were stationed right behind the net. Bowling coach Morne Morkel and assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate were also present to assist Kohli, who also had Devdutt Padikkal batting in the adjacent net.There were drives, plenty of them, during the session and the former captain was comfortably shouldering arms to deliveries on length. Every time he would miscue the drive or shot, Kohli would speak to the throwdown specialist or the bowler and the interactions continued throughout his session.It will be safe to say that he looked assured and solid during that hit before the morning session got underway but the touch of the nets hasn't translated into match form during his recent outings. He scored a hundred in the second innings of the Perth Test but has been dismissed in single digits in three out of the four other innings in the series.There is still a lot of cricket left in the series and India's prolific batter would hope he gets his act right for the next two fixtures in Melbourne and Sydney. And even in the second innings in Brisbane, if weather permits.","Virat Kohli faced a lot of deliveries from Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar and the throwdown specialists.

Down & out India might just have saved Brisbane Test after Nos. 10, 11, Bumrah and

Akash Deep

, defy Aussie bowlers and help avoid follow-on

BRISBANE: There were only 6171 people in attendance on another stop-start day at the Gabba, but they roared like a million as some incredible scenes played out in the gloom towards the end of Day Four in the third Test.After KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja had engineered a remarkable resistance, India still needed to avoid the follow on. Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep, the last men standing, were out of their comfort zone with bat in hand. Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc were breathing fire. The target was still some distance away. The scoreboard showed 213 - 33 runs short of the follow-on target - when Ravindra Jadeja, who stamped his presence for the first time in this series, holed out to deep square in an attempt to tonk Cummins out of the ground.Run by precious run, Bumrah and Deep inched towards the target, goaded on by the loud Indian supporters. Akash Deep is better than a regular No. 11. And as for Bumrah, you just can't keep him out of the game these days.On the previous day, asked about the horrid shots played by some of the top order batters, India's performer of the series had replied with a big grin, ""It's an interesting question. You're questioning my batting ability. You should use Google and see who has the most runs in a Test match, sorry, in a Test over! Jokes apart, that's another story.""There was no time for jokes out in the middle. Bumrah finally got tired of being targeted at his ribs and hooked Cummins over fine leg. Six! The Australian captain smiled. Next ball, a fiery bouncer, was evaded with expert ease. Akash Deep took a single off Starc and settled down. The light was fading fast. With India on 225, Akash Deep cut Starc over wide gully. A crucial four!Bumrah was beaten once but played out a fine over from Nathan Lyon. Deep hit Cummins down the ground for two, pleasing Rohit Sharma. Eventually, the target was whittled down to six, then five runs. Australia's supporters goaded their players on, screaming their lungs out but the side, a major bowler short, looked tired and unsettled at this point.Akash Deep took a single, leaving a calm Bumrah to play out Lyon again. Next over from Cummins, Deep was struck on the thigh first ball. Nerves. Sometime in between, towels, drinks and some messages arrived from the dugout. Don't try to hit everything out of the ground. Keep your poise.Suddenly, a switch went off in Akash Deep's head. He decided he had had enough and slashed hard past a leaping gully. Four! India had avoided the follow-on and rediscovered some self-belief on a most challenging but inspiring day. Deep followed with a six over midwicket, sending the ball soaring into the stands. Six! A statement of intent!Eventually, bad light stopped play with India on 252/9, the last pair having added 39 vital runs.Australia were keen to put India in again if Bumrah and Deep had failed. Even with the loss of Josh Hazlewood to injury, Cummins' men knew their best chance of a win was to rattle India's sketchy top order again. By avoiding the follow-on, Rohit Sharma's men had made their most important statement of the series. They were not prepared to roll over as a batting unit.At the centre of this resistance were KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja. Rahul (84 off 139 balls; 8x4) did all the initial hard work and held one end up. He bided his time, left on length, played late, blunted sharply-rearing deliveries with a loose bottom hand, and kept Australia attack at bay until the ball got softer and batting became easier.Some of his drives and check drives were sublime. Rahul also got lucky. Beginning the day on 33, Steve Smith dropped him first ball at second slip as a rearing Cummins delivery took the edge. Smith eventually got his man with an incredible, well-anticipated diving effort off Lyon, but by that time the moment had slipped away from Australia.The other, significant moment of the day for India came when Jadeja (77; 123b, 7x4, 1x6) twirled his bat, swordsman like, to celebrate his half-century and announce to the world that India had erred in keeping him out of the first two Tests. Jadeja had an ordinary day with the ball earlier, but after adding 67 with Rahul, he now averages 50.40 with the bat in Australia from five Tests.On Tuesday, he showed why, displaying immaculate control. He was prepared to leave balls outside off, ready to sweep Lyon, play either straight or square of the wicket. He eliminated the drive. He made full use of the best batting conditions and the tiring attack, but that is what India needed him to do.The series is still 1-1, and India would like to keep it that way heading into Melbourne. The rain may help. With a heavy downpour expected on the last day, wresting a draw here could mark an important turning point for Rohit Sharma's men in this series.","India avoided the follow-on and rediscovered some self-belief on a most challenging but inspiring day.

India's stand-in captain Smriti Mandhana expressed disappointment with her bowlers' subpar performance in the second T20I against the West Indies. Hayley Matthews ' unbeaten 85 powered the West Indies to a resounding nine-wicket victory, leveling the three-match series.India posted a total of 159 for 9, thanks to Mandhana's 62. However, the West Indies chased down the target with 26 balls to spare. Indian bowlers conceded 27 boundaries and two sixes. Mandhana found this unacceptable, even considering the dew factor.""I think conditions changed, but we couldn't execute our plans. There was moisture, but we couldn't do better. As a bowling unit, we need to excute our plans better going forward. There was a lot dew, but we can't complaint. We need to come back stronger in the next game,"" Mandhana said at the post-match presentation ceremony.Mandhana also felt the Indian batters could have performed better. She believed they were not able to replicate the same shot-making from the first game.""The kind of batting we could do in the first game, the same shots were not coming off tonight. We had to be a little more sensible and then start launching. We had a good launchpad.""Mandhana praised Richa Ghosh 's quickfire 32 off 17 balls, which helped India cross the 150-run mark. She admitted that the team could have added another 10-15 runs to their total.""Richa batted extremely well, we could have scored 10-15 runs more. Even me, getting out at the wrong time, I could have stayed (at the crease) more. Going forward, we will have to pride ourselves on executing what we want to execute.""According to Mandhana, dew became a factor during the latter half of India's innings. She acknowledged the challenging conditions but emphasized the need to adapt.""It (the dew) was not there as much in the first ten overs of their fielding. Cricket is a game where you cannot complain. We knew dew was going to be there. We have to put our hand up and figure out where to bowl when dew is there and even (be better) at fielding.""West Indies captain Hayley Matthews was pleased with her team's performance. She felt that 160 was a par score and they were happy with restricting India to that total.""We felt 160 was around par, we were happy with what they got in the end.

NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah ’s cheeky 'search it' remark, made while flaunting his batting skills, drew a witty response from Google and its CEO Sundar Pichai, adding a humorous twist to the viral moment.Bumrah, who shared an unbeaten 39-run stand for the 10th wicket with Akash Deep to help India avoid follow-on on Tuesday, showcased his batting capabilities just 24 hours after highlighting his batting achievements during a media interaction following the third day's play at the Gabba.At stumps on Day 4, Akash Deep remained not out at 27 while Bumrah held firm at 10.

Josh Hazlewood is likely to be absent for the remaining Border-Gavaskar Trophy matches due to a right calf strain.

The team also missed the chance to enforce the follow-on after strong batting by Akash Deep and Jasprit Bumrah on the fourth day.Cricket Australia's official statement confirmed Hazlewood's right calf strain and his unavailability for the remaining Test series against India.“Josh Hazlewood has sustained a right side calf strain which will prevent him from playing any further part in the Test match against India in Brisbane. He is likely to miss the remainder of the Test series.”Hazlewood bowled only one over on Tuesday before leaving the field after consulting with captain Pat Cummins , senior player Steve Smith, and physio Nick Jones. He subsequently underwent scans.“He's pretty despondent,”Assistant coach Daniel Vettori described Hazlewood's state during the post-day press conference.""(He) felt it this morning in warm-ups, gave it a good crack, it's just unfortunate for him to come back, put so much effort after another injury with the side strain, then to pick up a calf strain here, particularly in these circumstances is really tough on him,""”Vettori further explained the difficult timing of the injury, particularly after Hazlewood's recent return from a side strain.On Monday, the third day, Hazlewood had dismissed Virat Kohli with a delivery outside off-stump. This was a key moment before his injury.Hazlewood's inclusion in the third Test marked his comeback after missing the Adelaide Pink Ball Test due to a side strain. He had replaced Scott Boland in the playing eleven.“Obviously, it looks like Hazlewood will be out,”Vettori acknowledged the likelihood of Hazlewood's absence for the remainder of the series and Scott Boland is expected to return to the playing eleven for the Melbourne and Sydney Tests.Vettori highlighted Boland's consistent performance as a backup seamer and his strong record in Australian conditions.""I think Boland speaks for himself. I mean, the way he bowled in Adelaide, the way that he has consistently been the back-up seamer, and every single time he has been asked to step up, particularly in Australia, he has been outstanding, so I think that would be the logical thing to conclude.”","Josh Hazlewood is likely to be absent for the remaining Border-Gavaskar Trophy matches due to a right calf strain.

NEW DELHI: The Gabba Test is poised for a draw as weather conditions predict a 90% chance of rain on Day 5, potentially washing out play. Both India and Australia have fought hard in this gripping contest, but the looming rain threatens to deny cricket fans a conclusive result.As players prepare for the final day in Brisbane , the heavy rain forecast overshadows any hopes of a dramatic finish. While the game hangs in the balance, it seems the weather will be the ultimate decider.With only 192 overs completed over four days of play, Wednesday's forecast suggests additional disruptions are expected.According to a Accuweather.com report, the forecast for the Gabba suggests difficult morning conditions with overcast skies and elevated humidity levels. The afternoon will likely bring thunderstorms, with rainfall probability at 90%, despite moderate temperatures.The temperature will register approximately 31°C, though the humidity will create a perceived temperature of 38°C. Weather services anticipate 15.8 mm of precipitation, prompting authorities to issue a minor flood alert. The sky will remain heavily overcast with cloud cover reaching 96%.Team India displayed resilience on Day 4 of the third Test in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .

Mumbai: Prithvi Shaw 's career is suffering one setback after another, and is in real doldrums at the moment. A couple of days after Mumbai clinched the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy in Bengaluru for the second time in three seasons to complete a hat-trick of titles this season, Mumbai's selectors, in a meeting on Tuesday, surprisingly again dropped opener Prithvi Shaw, along with left-arm spinner Shams Mulani due to ""poor form.""Shaw had scored 197 runs off just 126 balls in nine matches@21.88, at an impressive strike rate of 156.34. He scored 10 runs against Madhya Pradesh in the SMAT final on Sunday.""Shaw has been dropped due to poor form. He has been inconsistent. We wanted to give the youngsters, Ayush Mhatre and Angkrish Raghuvanshi an opportunity,"" Mumbai chief selector Sanjay Patil told TOI.Meanwhile, in-form veteran batsman Ajinkya Rahane will skip the first three matches of the tournament (in Ahmedabad from Dec 21) as he has requested the MCA for a break due to a ""personal reason"", TOI has learnt. Iyer, who led Mumbai to the SMAT title, will continue to lead the side in the Vijay Hazare Trophy as well.Rahane was in blazing form in SMAT, smashing 469 runs in nine matches@58.62, including five fifties and scoring his runs at a fabulous strike rate of 164.56. Seamer Mohit Avasthi is out due to an injury.Patil also informed that ""Ajinkya Rahane has asked for a break from the first three matches due to personal reasons. He has a family function. Shreyas Iyer (under whom Mumbai clinched the SMAT title on Sunday) will be the Mumbai captain for the entire Vijay Hazare Trophy.""Expressing his disappointment at the decision to axe him again-he had been dropped during the Ranji Trophy but received a recall for SMAT, Shaw vented out his emotions in a post on Instagram. ""Tell me God, what more do I have to see..if 65 innings, 3399 runs at an average of 55.7 with a strike rate of 126, I'm not good enough...but I will keep my faith in you and hopefully people believe in me still..cause I will come back for sure..OM SAI RAM..""After leading Mumbai to the SMAT title, Mumbai skipper Shreyas Iyer, while talking about Shaw’s recent struggles, had said that the 25-year-old was extremely talented, needed to get his work ethic right. “""I think, personally, he is a God-gifted player. The amount of talent he possesses as an individual, no one has it. He just needs to get his work ethics right, and if he does that, sky is the limit for him. We can’t babysit anyone, right? Every professional who is playing at this level, they need to know what they should be doing,” Iyer had said.On Monday, Mumbai's head coach Avishkar Salvi had revealed that the Mumbai Cricket Association was backing Shaw despite axing him from the Ranji Trophy squad, and the batter would “peak at the right time.”“I think the association has backed him well. Even though he was not part of the Ranji Trophy, I think the association took care of his practice, his fitness. There were routines given to him for the three weeks to be followed. I think that was pretty much taken care of by the association and the coaches from the academy. We were all very involved in it. And I think he came over there, he took that effort, he did his hard yards over there,” Salvi had said.“And then he came over here in this format, from those preparations. I think he is building up well. I think he will peak at the right time/ That's what we expect,” he added.Shreyas lyer (Captain), Ayush Mhatre, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Jay Bista, Suryakumar Yadav , Shivam Dube, Suryansh Shedge, Siddhesh Lad, Hardik Tamore (WK), Prasad Pawar (WK), Atharva Ankolekar, Tanush Kotian, Shardul Thakur, Royston Dias, Juned Khan, Harsh Tanna, Vinayak Bhoir","Prithvi Shaw and Shams Mulani dropped by Mumbai selectors.

(Reuters)

Rome: Inter Milan are hot on the heels of Serie A leaders Atalanta after crushing Lazio 6-0 in Rome on Monday to demolish one of the division's form teams and send a message to the rest of the league.Reigning champions Inter came through what was supposed to be a tough test at the Stadio Olimpico with flying colours and are three points off the Scudetto pace with a game in hand.Simone Inzaghi's side sealed the points with goals equally distributed either side of half-time from Hakan Calhanoglu, Federico Dimarco, Nicolo Barella and Denzel Dumfries, before Carlos Augusto and Marcus Thuram completed the rout with two late strikes.""It's three-and-a-half years that these boys have given me this level of commitment and I'm proud to be their manager,"" said Inzaghi to DAZN.Inter have an Italian Cup tie with Udinese on Thursday and league fixtures against Como and Cagliari before jetting off to Saudi Arabia, where they face Atalanta in the semi-finals of the Italian Super Cup on January 2.""It's going to be complicated but I hope we put in the same effort and level of performance like the one tonight,"" added Inzaghi.An unexpectedly heavy defeat for Lazio, who came into Monday's showdown off the back of fine away wins at Napoli and Ajax, left them fifth and six points behind Atalanta.Inter statementIt also damaged any ideas of Lazio being dark horses for a first league title in a quarter of a century as Marco Baroni's side crumbled once Calhanoglu rammed home the penalty which opened the scoring in the 41st minute.""I'm sorry for our supporters and I take responsibility for the defeat. We played well for the first 40 minutes but then collapsed, we fell apart"" said Lazio coach Baroni.""We did things that you just can't do against a team like Inter and that means I didn't do a good enough job.""The awarding of Inter's spot-kick, for a Samuel Gigot handball following a VAR check, came just after Inter had had a goal chalked off for offside during the same penalty box melee and angered Lazio.And the hosts, who had been the better side in the opening half an hour, were punished for lax defending when Dimarco volleyed home a brilliant second four minutes later after sneaking in unmarked at the back post to meet Dumfries' pinpoint cross.Any hope of a second-half fightback was ended when Barella crashed in his third goal of the season from distance in the 51st minute and Dumfries capitalised on more poor Lazio defending two minutes later with a bullet header.Carlos Augusto then become the third Inter wing-back to score of the evening in the 77th minute when he expertly controlled Dimarco's pass to spin Adam Marusic and calmly slot home the fifth.Thuram's brilliant individual strike wasn't just a slap in the face for Lazio, it also made Inter Serie A's top scorers ahead of Atalanta and emphatically showed that they won't give up their title easily.","Inter Milan thrash Lazio 6-0 in Serie A.

Manchester City 's Phil Foden maintains that the players continue to support manager Pep Guardiola despite their recent loss to Manchester United , which prolonged their disappointing run.Following Sunday's 2-1 defeat to Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium, City has now lost eight of their last eleven matches across all competitions.City's defense, which has been a recurring issue in their decline, faltered in the final minutes, allowing United to score twice and further diminish the Premier League champions' chances of securing a fifth consecutive title.Currently in fifth place, City trails the league leaders, Liverpool, by nine points, with Liverpool having a game in hand. City has already suffered five league defeats this season, compared to just three throughout the entire previous season.After the game, Guardiola admitted, feeling the weight of the worst crisis of his managerial career, that he is ""not good enough.""Despite this, Foden affirms that the squad remains behind Guardiola, who recently signed a new two-year contract.“We are still nowhere near our level, but I still believe that we are playing good enough to get points and results,” he said.Foden believes City is playing well enough to earn points and achieve positive results, despite not reaching their full potential.He highlights the team's tendency to lose focus at crucial moments, emphasizing the need for sustained concentration throughout the entire match.“It's about remaining focused throughout the full 90 minutes, but we keep switching off at important times. We just need to get the focus right.” he said.He emphasizes the importance of unity, regrouping, and drawing confidence from past accomplishments. Foden underscores the team's continued faith in Guardiola's methods.“We stick together, regroup and believe in ourselves after what we've achieved in the past.” he said.“We keep believing in the process and the manager -- I'm sure if we do that we will get back to winning ways and get back to our level.” he said.City faces a crucial Premier League match against Aston Villa on Saturday, needing to rediscover their winning form.Foden admits to being perplexed by City's sudden downturn, noting the evident impact on team morale following the derby loss.“I can't put a finger on what's going on,” Foden said.He believes their performances have warranted better results but acknowledges a recurring pattern of missed opportunities. He stresses the importance of team cohesion during this challenging period.“I thought the performance was more than good enough to get the result, but we come out with no points, and it seems to be the same story at the moment. We just have to stick together.” he said.He acknowledges the current disappointment within the team but emphasizes the need to move forward.“The changing room is obviously going to be down and sad at the moment, but we can't dwell on this too much.” he said.Following the Villa match, City will host Everton on December 26th and then travel to Leicester for their final game of 2024.With the demanding festive season approaching, Foden urges his teammates to maintain their unity and resilience.“It's about keeping our mentality strong throughout the whole 90 minutes and we're not doing that at the moment,” he said.He calls for the team to display character and overcome this difficult period. Foden expresses optimism about City's ability to rebound and regain their previous form.“We have to go again and show character to come back from this blip.” he said.“It's not a time for moaning, it's about sticking together, remaining strong and going again. I'm positive we are going to come back.” he said.City's upcoming fixtures present a crucial opportunity for them to address their current slump and reclaim their position among the league's top contenders.","Manchester City lost 2-1 to Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.

and longevity…

American men haven't had results like the women:

Graf was the hardest victory I ever had: Agassi

BENGALURU: Andre Agassi wondered if the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic would miss his greatest rivals -- the now-retired Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer -- in the last leg of a glittering career where the 37-year-old goes for more history.The eight-time Grand Slam champion, in the city for the TiE Global Summit, assessed Djokovic's run and the Serb's recent partnership with friend and rival Andy Murray in a candid chat with media.It's hard to say, Father Time always wins. He has already done so much for so long, it's hard to imagine longer. We said that about (Roger) Federer too. I think Novak will run out of energy more than capability. Cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left, that's a big thing.When Pete (Sampras) retired it was a blow to me, it set me back a little bit. It made me rediscover my inspirations on some level. Djokovic has lost the guys he made history with. It'll probably get tougher and tougher emotionally, but I would never bet against them. Bet against them at your peril.In any coach-student relationship you need trust and trust can take time, but it's nice when it starts with believing in somebody because you know that they know your experience. There's an asset to their history as competitors.Any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in and that's always the part you have to wait and see. It's not what I know that changes your career, information doesn't lead to transformation, somebody has to counter that. That's the connector. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of trust immediately, we'll see how the results go.Alcaraz defends like Novak, has more power and spin like Nadal, hands and finesse like Federer but just because he has the best of all the three doesn't mean he can do what they did. There are so many parts to the game such as decision-making, injuries, luck. So how long can (Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner) do it (for)? They could do it for 20 years or not.The women's game hasn't had to deal with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, but they have their version of it. Serena Williams is the Novak of the women's game and you got Coco as a potential, like Alcaraz has potential and Sinner has potential.How the game evolves is interesting. The women's game has gotten very powerful, just straight power. For lack of a better example, Lindsay Davenport was powerful, tall, precise through the court and now you have a lot of that. There's still room for somebody who can offset that kind of power, like an Ash Barty.The men's game has changed in the sense that guys have gotten bigger with longer levers, which means they're better athletes, they can move and they need more time, they start playing further back. Soon you're going to start seeing the net game start coming back, everything morphs in its own way. But the biggest issue for American (men) not winning is an unfortunate set of decades where the guys were very stingy and very greedy -- 66 Grand Slams in the same generation. There's not a lot left there (for others)!Andre Agassi - the second of five men to achieve a career Grand Slam in the Open Era and the first man to complete a career golden slam - has won it all, including a stirring love match.""She was the hardest victory I ever had,"" said Agassi of his wife German tennis legend Steffi Graf, a 22-time major winner.Agassi, who has won eight major titles and the Olympic gold, speaking during a session at the TiE Global Summit, said, ""We all live a hero's journey - first part of life is about performing and achieving. Then life hits us with broken relationships and dreams. I went through it all. Finally, in the last phase of the journey, it's about serving others.""The 54-year-old said, ""At 28 my (tennis) career started over. Without the struggles, I would've never gotten Steffi to say yes. I tried to get her for years.""On a lighter note, Agassi said he likes to keep his trophies out of the house. ""I don't bring my trophies home, because if I bring my trophies home, then she brings her trophies home - and that's bad math!""",Andre Agassi believes Novak Djokovic will run out of energy more than capability.

NEW DELHI: Legendary player Andre Agassi observed that Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal , while advising the tennis world against anticipating the young Spaniard to match the extraordinary achievements of these tennis legends.The collective Grand Slam victories of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic stand at 66, whilst Alcaraz, aged 21, has secured four major titles thus far.""I'm not a genius and I don't have a crystal ball. What I can tell you is Alcaraz defends like Novak, has power and spin like Nadal and has hands and finesse like Federer,"" said Agassi during a talk session in Bengaluru.The eight-time Grand Slam victor Agassi elaborated on why excessive expectations shouldn't burden Alcaraz.""Just because he has the best of all those three doesn't mean he can do what they did because there're so many other parts to the game, which mean decision-making, injuries, you know, luck,"" he said.With Djokovic at 37, approaching retirement, Agassi noted that the Serbian's competitive edge might diminish without Nadal and Federer in the arena.""He's already done so much, so long, and it's hard to imagine longer. I think he'll run out of the energy for it more than the capability of it, I would imagine.""It cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left.""The American provided additional context to his assessment.""When Pete (Sampras) retired, it was a blow to me. It set me back a little bit. It made me have to rediscover my inspirations on some level.""And he's (Djokovic) lost the guys that he's made history with. So, it's probably emotionally going to get tougher and tougher quickly, but I would never bet against him. Bet against him at your own peril,"" said Agassi.Regarding Djokovic's recent appointment of Andy Murray as coach to extend his career, Agassi expressed interest in their partnership's development.""They've been fierce rivals on court, and now Murray will be coaching Djokovic. Well, in any coaching student relationship, you need trust. Trust can take time.""I think there's an asset to their history as competitors, but any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in.""",Andre Agassi says Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

NEW DELHI: Tennis icon Andre Agassi on Tuesday highlighted how sports should remain integral to education, noting their role in teaching children to cope with defeat.At a Bengaluru event focussed on sports and education's role in fostering excellence, Agassi shared his insights.""Even when you have a failure, you have to get up and play again the next day. So, what sports is teaching you is that focusing on winning and losing is really a distraction from what we need to be thinking about. We need to be thinking about how to get better,"" he said.Since 2001, Agassi has invested in education for underprivileged children, establishing 130 schools serving approximately 80,000 students in the United States. He attributes this achievement to his persistent drive to overcome obstacles.His demanding tennis career shaped his ability to maintain focus and adapt when necessary.""Sports is all about problem-solving. Tennis taught me how to navigate a very intense environment and maintain my objectivity and problem-solving abilities. It forces me to be present, but also to understand the context of what I'm doing,"" Agassi said.Regarding his earlier defiant period, Agassi acknowledged it as a necessary phase in his journey.""Vulnerability is essential for growth, and I think vulnerability eventually leads to humility,"" he added.He recognised technology's crucial role in education, particularly in providing individualised learning opportunities for children. This belief influenced his investment in the Indian EdTech company, Square Panda .""I think technology can play an essential role, not just in scalability, but also in optimising personalised learning. That's why I got involved with Square Panda. We are here because of the sheer scale of impact the technology will bring to education,"" he said.","Tennis icon Andre Agassi highlighted how sports should remain integral to education.

NEW DELHI: Former world number one tennis player from Romania Simona Halep has raised concerns about the perceived discrepancies in the treatment of cases involving positive tests for banned substances by the International Tennis Integrity Agency ( ITIA ).Her criticism stems from the recent one-month ban imposed on Iga Swiatek , the current world number two, after testing positive for the heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in an out-of-competition sample.Halep, who returned to tennis in March 2023 after serving a provisional suspension since October 2022 for testing positive for roxadustat at the US Open, believes there is a lack of consistency in the ITIA's approach.She questions the significant difference in the penalties handed out to her and Swiatek, despite the cases occurring around the same time.In her statement, Halep expressed her bewilderment at the disparate treatment and questioned the logical reasoning behind the ITIA's decisions. She accused the organization of attempting to ""destroy"" her career, despite the evidence presented, and claimed to have suffered from the perceived injustice.“I have always believed in good, I have believed in the fairness of this sport, I have believed in kindness,"" Halep wrote on Instagram. “The injustice that was done to me was painful, is painful and maybe will always be painful.

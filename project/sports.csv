Chess is not so popular actually here in Belarus, but it’s not as if there is completely nothing. We have some support, and we have some good players Denis Lazavik, Belarus No. 1 Chess Player

Poll Should chess players from Russia and Belarus be allowed to compete internationally? Yes, they should compete under their national flags. No, they should only compete under the FIDE flag. Yes, but with certain restrictions. No, they should be suspended indefinitely.

Long before Russia emerged from the shadow of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the land was already a chess powerhouse.The clubrooms in Moscow and the grand tournament halls in St. Petersburg turned chess into something far greater than a mere pastime; the Soviet school of chess, as many enthusiasts can recall, was so meticulous and so deeply strategic that an aspiring player would board ships from faraway lands just to witness it firsthand, almost as if the game was woven into the very air they breathed. Players would learn Russian to decode the endless pages of chess theory and arm themselves with new strategies.A home to so many legends in the game of 64 squares, from Mikhail Botvinnik, Boris Spassky and Garry Kasparov to Vladimir Kramnik, is witnessing a slow erosion of its proud chess heritage.With President Vladimir Putin showing no signs of ending the aggression in Ukraine, the aftershocks are being felt far beyond the battlefield, with neighbouring Belarus also bearing the brunt.“After the war started in Ukraine, we don’t have many possibilities to play. I mean, like a team, as a team we can’t play. So it’s also many players are changing federation,” Belarus No. 1 Denis Lazavik tellsduring an exclusive interview from Minsk.Back in 2022, following the IOC’s suspension of Russian and Belarusian athletes, FIDE, the global governing body for chess, followed suit, suspending their national teams from official tournaments while allowing individual players to compete under the FIDE flag.That suspension, initially temporary, has now been extended to January 2026.In Russia alone, the ongoing conflict has prompted hundreds of chess players to change their sporting nationality. Among them are former Women’s World Champion Alexandra Kosteniuk (Russia to Switzerland) and top Grandmasters such as Vladimir Fedoseev (Russia to Slovenia), Kirill Alekseenko (Russia to Austria), Nikita Vitiugov (Russia to England), Alexandr Predke (Russia to Serbia), and Sanan Sjugirov (Russia to Hungary).For someone like 18-year-old Lazavik, this has created a painful paradox: to play, they must sometimes abandon the very flag they grew up under.“I haven’t thought about it (changing federation). But if it gets worse, of course, I might change. But now I feel kind of okay here. I have some support, and I don’t think that it will be useful to change now,” adds Lazavik, who was invited to the Global Chess League Contenders this year.Born in Minsk, Lazavik kick-started his chess journey at the age of seven. A father, who was not a professional player but an avid enthusiast, helped him learn the basics and up his level on the board. Chess sections in school soon became his playground, and by age eight, he was already outpacing peers, collecting trophies and medals.“I won more or less everything until maybe 12 or 13,” he recalls. “Even without regular training, I was just kind of talented enough to win.”Belarus may not boast the chess culture of Russia, but it has nurtured its share of gifted minds.“Chess is not so popular actually here in Belarus, but it’s not as if there is completely nothing. We have some support, and we have some good players,” Lazavik shares.Being the No. 1 player in the country, though, is a challenge in itself. There’s hardly anyone left to play against at home, which means Denis must travel abroad to find stronger opponents and earn valuable rating points.""When I was a kid, it was kind of hard for my parents financially because Belarus is not a rich country. Travelling to Europe or especially the US for tournaments was difficult,"" the teenage Grandmaster reveals, admitting that visa troubles at times turn his days into nightmares.""But now, the federation supports me, and I’ve already won some prizes. So it’s not such a big issue anymore, I can afford to spend on tournaments myself.""Lazavik dreams of climbing to a 2700 rating, perhaps one day competing for the World Championship.“I think I can earn lots of ratings and improve maybe until like 2700. Step by step, I will improve my game, and then we’ll see,” the 2605-rated player says with a smile. “I just feel that I haven't achieved my maximum potential. Right now, I just feel that I’m playing better than my level.”Where smiles are scarce, one can only pretend to be living in normalcy. Yet, Lazavik wants to look beyond his plight, beyond the board: “Of course, it’s bad here, but there are many people who feel worse… in Ukraine, in Russia. So, it’s not really, really bad in terms of chess.”","Belarus No. 1 chess player Denis Lazavik speaks to CNN about the impact of Russia-Ukraine conflict. He says chess is not so popular in his country, but there are some good players. The 18-year-old admits that travelling to Europe or the US for tournaments is difficult.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124524846,imgsize-108218,width-400,resizemode-4/chess-players-like-denis-lazavik-bear-the-brunt-of-russia-ukraine-photo-by-ap-amp-chesscomthomas-tischio.jpg"

Poll What do you think about Noman Ali's performance in the Test match? Exceptional, he played brilliantly! Decent, but could improve Average, didn't stand out Poor, wasn't effective at all

Former Pakistan captain and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ramiz Raja mocked 39-year-old spinner Noman Ali for his “sunglass choice” on the second day of the first Test between Pakistan and South Africa at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.Pakistan left-arm spinner Noman Ali took four wickets for 85 runs as world champions South Africa fought hard to reach 216/6 on a tricky wicket for batters.“He is wearing a fancy pair of glasses,” Raja said during commentary.“They look like welding glasses,” he added.Spinners dominated on the turning Gaddafi Stadium pitch, with all 11 wickets of the day falling to slow bowlers. South African left-armer Senuran Muthusamy claimed a career-best 6/117, helping dismiss Pakistan for 378.“We need to get them out as early as possible, and a 120-run lead would help us win this Test,” said Noman.“This pitch will further help spinners in the coming days, so it’s good for us.”At the close, De Zorzi was holding the fort with 81 not out, while Muthusamy was on six, as South Africa trailed by 162 runs in the first innings.De Zorzi batted with courage, hitting nine boundaries and a six, taking on Noman, who had claimed 4/85.South Africa started well with 45/0 on the board before Noman removed touring skipper Aiden Markram for 20 and Wiaan Mulder for 17 — both caught behind by wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan.Ryan Rickelton, who scored a punishing 71 with two sixes and nine boundaries, and De Zorzi added 94 for the third wicket, taking on the spinners with aggressive shots.It was part-timer Salman Agha who broke the stand, forcing an edge from Rickelton, with Babar Azam taking a smart low catch in the slips.Noman returned for his third spell to dismiss Tristan Stubbs caught behind for eight, Kyle Verreynne leg-before for two, while Sajid Khan removed Dewald Brevis for a golden duck.","Pakistan left-arm spinner Noman Ali took four wickets for 85 runs as world champions South Africa fought hard to reach 216/6 on a tricky wicket for batters.

Poll Who do you think will have the biggest impact in the T20I series against England? Mitchell Santner Rachin Ravindra Jimmy Neesham Tim Seifert

New Zealand cricket team announced changes to their squad for the upcoming T20I series against England, with white-ball captain Mitchell Santner and all-rounder Rachin Ravindra returning to the team, while Kane Williamson targets a comeback during the ODI leg. The three-match T20I series begins on October 18 at Hagley Oval, followed by three ODIs starting October 26.Santner has recovered from his recent abdominal surgery and will lead the side in the T20I series. Ravindra, who was previously ruled out of the Australian series due to a facial injury, makes his return to the squad.Kane Williamson, who recently returned from overseas, is set to make his international cricket comeback during the ODI series against England in his hometown of Tauranga.Wellington Firebirds fast-bowler Ben Sears will miss the England series after suffering a left-hamstring tear during training last week. The injury requires three to four weeks for recovery.Jimmy Neesham has been selected as the seam-bowling all-rounder following his impressive performance against Australia. The pace-bowling group remains unchanged with Jacob Duffy, Zak Foulkes, Matt Henry, and Kyle Jamieson.Michael Bracewell joins Santner in the spin department, while Ish Sodhi misses out. Tim Seifert will serve as the T20 wicket-keeper, joining the same batting unit that faced Australia.""Fresh from taking on Australia, it is great to have another world-class team arrive on our shores. We know what an exciting brand of cricket Harry Brook and his T20 boys play, and I am sure our guys are looking forward to meeting that challenge head on,"" said NZ coach Rob Walter.""It's awesome to hear the first game at Hagley Oval is about to sell-out and that will make for a fantastic occasion to start the series on Saturday night,"" Walter added.""It's great to have Mitch back. Alongside being our leader, he is one of the very best white-ball spinners in the world and his skills and experience will be a welcome addition. Likewise, it is nice to welcome back Rachin who was unlucky to miss out on Australia and I know is really excited for this series,"" Walter continued.""Kane had to overcome a minor medical issue in the past month, and we agreed he needs some more time to get himself physically ready to return. He is obviously a world-class player and we're hoping these two weeks will ensure he is ready for the ODIs against England and the following tour by West Indies.""""Ben had some discomfort while bowling last Tuesday, and the subsequent hamstring tear ruled him out of contention for this series. We wish him a speedy recovery and hope to see him back in the mix in the near future,"" Walter concluded.Several players were unavailable for selection due to injuries, including Finn Allen (foot), Adam Milne (ankle), Will O'Rourke (back), Glenn Phillips (groin), and Lockie Ferguson (hamstring).The New Zealand T20I squad: Mitchell Santner (captain), Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Jacob Duffy, Zak Foulkes, Matt Henry, Bevon Jacobs, Kyle Jamieson, Daryl Mitchell, Jimmy Neesham, Rachin Ravindra, Tim Robinson, and Tim Seifert (wk).",New Zealand announce changes to squad for T20I series against England.

Poll What do you think about Sachin Tendulkar's acknowledgment of those who helped him in his career? It's inspiring and humble It's expected, he's a celebrity It's overrated I don't care about his acknowledgments

The beauty of Sachin Tendulkar is that the legend never forgets to acknowledge those who contributed in any way to his success, especially in the early part of his life, when he was a middle-class boy trying to make a mark in the game.On Friday, while launching his sportswear and athleisure brand in Mumbai, the retired maestro remembered how his Mumbai and India teammate—and, most importantly, close friend—Pravin Amre, who was also his senior by four years at Shardashram Vidyamandir school, gifted him a pair of shoes when he was a teenager. This came after Amre returned from the India Under-19 tour of Australia, keeping a promise he had made to the then-prodigious batsman: he would give Tendulkar a pair of shoes once he scored a century.It so happened that when Tendulkar first went to his famous childhood coach Ramakant Achrekar’s nets, he was wearing a pair of white canvas shoes with flat green soles—something that was the norm for PE classes in school back then. After a few days, Achrekar asked Tendulkar’s brother, Ajit, to arrange a pair of cricket shoes with spikes for the boy.Narrating the tale of how Amre gifted him his first pair of classy, expensive cricket shoes by offering him an incentive to score a century in inter-school cricket, Tendulkar said, ""Pravin, who is also here, had gone to Australia and played for the India Under-19 team.After he returned from there, Achrekar sir told us: 'Watch his batting.' So we would watch him very closely, and while observing his batting, we would notice what kit he was using, which bat, which shoes. We saw some fancy cricket shoes in his kit bag, and we were naturally fascinated by those shoes. Pravin told me: 'Score a hundred and take them!'""So, when I scored a hundred, I didn't have the guts to tell him that he had promised me a pair if I scored a hundred. But Pravin himself came to me, and the first good-quality pair of shoes of my life was given to me! I cannot forget that.""Reacting to Tendulkar expressing gratitude for his generous act even after so many years, Amre, who was part of the audience that included chief selector and ex-India pacer Ajit Agarkar and former India stumper Kiran More, told TOI on Sunday: “I just didn’t expect Sachin to say that! I was really overwhelmed that he still remembered this gesture even after so many years. I had totally forgotten about it! This incident must’ve happened in 1987 or 1988. This is what makes Tendulkar truly a legend of sport. It marks his greatness. I remember they were imported shoes—you didn’t get such shoes in India back then. They were spike shoes for batting. I feel so proud that I gifted them to the right person, who went on to become perhaps the greatest cricketer ever!”“After the programme, I told him it was just a small thing I did for him. But he replied by saying that at that point in his life, it was a big thing for him!” Amre, a former India batsman who scored a courageous century on his Test debut against South Africa at Durban in 1992, added.",Sachin Tendulkar recalls how Pravin Amre gifted him a pair of shoes when he was a teenager. Amre had promised the then-prodigious batsman that he would give him shoes once he scored a century in inter-school cricket.

'We got desperate': Rohit Sharma on what clicked at 2025 Champions Trophy

Poll Do you think Rohit Sharma will continue to play till the 2027 WC after losing the ODI captaincy? Yes, he has proven himself No, he will fade away

Former India captain Rohit Sharma made his first public appearance since being replaced as ODI skipper, attending the 27th CEAT Cricket Rating Awards in Mumbai last week.Looking noticeably leaner and fitter, Rohit drew attention for more than just his physical transformation. In particular, his thoughtful act during the ceremony has now gone viral.Seated beside ODI vice-captain Shreyas Iyer , Rohit appeared relaxed, chatting with his wife Ritika Sajdeh through the evening.Iyer had earlier gone on stage to collect the CEAT JioStar Award but, after returning to his seat, placed the memento on the floor beside him instead of holding it or setting it on a table.Moments later, Rohit noticed the trophy near Iyer’s feet. Without making a fuss, the 38-year-old quietly picked it up and placed it on a nearby table in a gesture that has since drawn wide praise on social media. Fans lauded Rohit for his respect toward awards and achievements, calling it a small but telling sign of his humility and leadership.The event also marked Rohit’s first public outing since Shubman Gill took over the ODI captaincy. Yet, the veteran opener looked far from a man stepping away from the spotlight. Having led India to back-to-back ICC titles, clinching the 2024 T20 World Cup and the 2025 Champions Trophy, Rohit’s renewed fitness and energy sent a strong message that he remains hungry for more.Speaking on the sidelines of the event, Rohit said his focus remains firmly on cricket, particularly the upcoming ODI series against Australia starting October 19. “I love playing against them. I love going to Australia. It's a very challenging country to play cricket. People there love the game as well,” he said.He added, “Australia is a different challenge every time they have played against us. Having been there now several times, I do understand what to expect. Hopefully we can go there and do what the Indian team is supposed to do and get the result in our favour.”Even without the captain’s badge, Rohit’s calm composure and instinctive respect at the event reflected why he remains one of Indian cricket’s most admired figures.","Former India captain Rohit Sharma made his first public appearance since being replaced as ODI skipper, attending the 27th CEAT Cricket Rating Awards in Mumbai last week.

NEW DELHI: The blockbuster ICC Women’s World Cup clash between India and Australia at Visakhapatnam on Sunday will be remembered as one of the most record-laden matches in tournament history.From individual brilliance to historic team feats, the match rewrote multiple record-books as Australia chased down a mammoth 331 to win by three wickets with an over to spare.Indian opener Smriti Mandhana once again showcased her extraordinary form, scoring 80 and reaching a monumental milestone of 5,000 WODI runs, becoming the youngest and fastest woman to achieve the feat. Mandhana also became the first-ever player to cross 1,000 runs in a calendar year, amassing 1,062 runs in 18 innings this year alone. Her recent dominance over Australia continued, with five consecutive 50+ scores against the defending champions, cementing her status as an “Aussie hunter” akin to Virat Kohli in men’s cricket.Mandhana’s opening partner Pratika Rawal complemented her perfectly. Their 155-run partnership was not only the highest opening stand against Australia in Women’s World Cups but also the second-most century stands by an Indian pair in ODIs this calendar year. Together, they have registered six century partnerships, second only to Mithali Raj and Punam Raut.For Australia, all-rounder Annabel Sutherland turned 24 in style, taking her first five-wicket haul (5/40) and reaching her 50th WODI wicket.She became the first woman to claim a five-wicket haul on her birthday and only the second cricketer overall to achieve this in ODI cricket.Posting 330, India set their highest-ever World Cup total, surpassing the 317/8 against West Indies in 2022.Australian skipper Alyssa Healy stole the show with a masterful 142 off 107 balls, including 21 fours and three sixes. Her innings set the highest-ever successful chase in women’s ODI history, eclipsing Sri Lanka’s 302-run chase against South Africa last year. Healy’s knock also tied her with Karen Rolton and Meg Lanning for the most centuries by an Australian in Women’s World Cups.The match was also a six-fest, with 13 sixes smashed — seven by India and six by Australia — the most sixes in a single Women’s World Cup match.","India beat Australia by three wickets in the ICC Women's World Cup.

Poll Do you think India's lower-order collapse was the main reason for their loss against Australia? Yes No

NEW DELHI: India captain Harmanpreet Kaur admitted that her team’s shocking lower-order collapse proved decisive as world champions Australia chased down a record 331 to claim a thrilling three-wicket victory in the Women’s World Cup on Sunday.India appeared set for a mammoth total at 294 for 4 in the 43rd over, but their innings unraveled dramatically, losing the last six wickets for just 36 runs in seven overs. Annabel Sutherland spearheaded Australia’s comeback, ripping through the Indian lower order to grab her maiden five-wicket haul (5/40).“The way we started, we could have added 30-40 more runs,” Harmanpreet said at the post-match presentation. “We missed runs in the last six overs and that cost us. It was a good batting wicket, but not batting well in the end made the difference.”Earlier, openers Smriti Mandhana (80) and Pratika Rawal (75) provided the perfect platform with a 155-run stand. But despite a strong foundation, India’s middle and lower order failed to capitalise once again — an area that has plagued the team in the last few matches.“Openers have been outstanding, because of them we’ve been scoring 300-plus,” Harmanpreet said.“But the last five overs hurt us. In the last three games, we haven’t finished well in the middle and death overs. These things happen — it’s important how we come back.”India’s five-bowler strategy, designed to strengthen their batting, also came under scrutiny after the bowlers struggled to contain the Aussies. Harmanpreet hinted that the team might revisit the combination.“We’ll sit and discuss. This combination has given us success, and two bad games are not going to change that,” she said.Among bowlers, only Shree Charani (3/41) impressed, while the rest proved expensive. “She has been outstanding — even against top batters like Healy, she kept things tight,” Harmanpreet praised.Alyssa Healy powered Australia’s chase with a blistering 142 off 107 balls, while Ellyse Perry’s unbeaten 47 guided them home with an over to spare — completing the highest successful chase in women’s ODI history.","India captain Harmanpreet Kaur admits her team's lower-order collapse proved decisive as world champions Australia chased down a record 331 to claim a thrilling three-wicket victory.

Srinagar:

Umran Malik burst onto the scene in 2022, his raw pace leaving cricket fans and experts alike in awe. Soon after, he broke into India’s white-ball setup. But just as quickly, he dropped off the radar — no longer in the mix for either his IPL franchise, Sunrisers Hyderabad, or the national team.A dip in form and a string of injuries meant that, for the next two seasons, the 25-year-old speedster was seen more as a liability than an asset. But Malik didn’t let it bog him down. He took the setbacks in stride, focused on pushing himself harder, honed his skills, and maintained his trademark pace — all in the hope that better days were just around the corner.The hard work has finally paid off, and Malik feels his efforts will help him last the distance this season. His first big test comes against 42-time champions Mumbai, who open their Ranji Trophy campaign against Jammu & Kashmir at the Sher-I-Kashmir Stadium from Wednesday.Malik bowled for almost an hour and a half in the nets without breaking a sweat. Bystanders — mostly from the Jammu & Kashmir Cricket Association — said this is the best they’ve seen him in years. But as always in cricket, performance must match the hype.“I’m feeling good. I’m entering this Ranji season after a strong build-up through the Buchi Babu and local tournaments. I’ve taken good care of my body and trained well.Gradually, I’ve increased my bowling load to be match-ready,” Malik told TOI.Even though this will be his first competitive match since his lone appearance in the 2024 IPL, the right-arm pacer insists, “There’s no nervousness, even though I’m returning after a year. The focus is on playing good cricket and doing what I do — taking wickets.”After limited appearances in the 2023 and 2024 IPL seasons with Sunrisers Hyderabad, Malik was handed a fresh lease of life when Kolkata Knight Riders picked him up in the 2025 auction. But a hip injury sustained three to four months before the tournament forced him to pull out.That setback marked the beginning of a long road to recovery, giving him time for introspection. “Injuries are part of a fast bowler’s life. Last year, I got injured for the first time and missed the entire season. But that break taught me a lot about how to manage my body. That phase is over now, and my body feels much better,” Malik said.“I’ve done everything a fast bowler needs to do. I’ve trained hard — every day, every morning, every evening. Because of that, my body feels stronger, and I’m looking forward to playing as much cricket as possible,” he added.During his rehab, Malik trained under former India assistant coach Abhishek Nayar in Chennai. Like Rohit Sharma , KL Rahul , and several others, he has high praise for Nayar. Having first worked with him during his KKR stint, Malik decided to continue that relationship. “Working with him has helped. He keeps players in the right frame of mind. The way he breaks things down helps you focus on what really matters,” Malik said.Malik now sounds as confident as he did back in 2022, when after just four or five matches he knew he would play for India. “Even Dale Steyn (SRH’s bowling coach in 2022) told me at the end of that season that I would play for India,” he recalled.Malik admits to disappointment over limited opportunities with Sunrisers after the 2022 season, when he consistently clocked above 150 kmph and took 22 wickets. “There was disappointment. One season I take 22 wickets, and the next I’m sitting on the bench. But I tried to stay motivated,” said Malik, who played just nine IPL matches across the 2023 and 2024 seasons.",Umran Malik returns to competitive cricket for Jammu & Kashmir in Ranji Trophy.

No Chance for West Indies? Fans upbeat about India's opening day domination | IND vs WI 1st Test

Could India have done things differently on the field and with the ball on a pancake-flat Kotla surface on Monday? And will there be a subsequent attempt to return to the rank turners of the past when South Africa visit next month? These were the primary questions facing the team management after a resilient West Indies stretched the second Test to Day Five.As Ravindra Jadeja had said on Day Three, perhaps India were not expecting the pitch to hold so firm, likely leading to some tactical errors early on Monday, which they subsequently rectified. On such a slow surface, with the ball often keeping low, it was imperative to pull back lengths and force the batsmen onto the backfoot, or make them play square of the wicket on either side. When they eventually did so, the bowlers found wickets in clumps.In the morning session, with the ball reversing slightly, India were perhaps guilty of being a bit defensive with their fields when Jasprit Bumrah bowled. There was no slip for Bumrah; instead, an extra cover was in place. Maybe India also missed a trick by not bowling short to either Shai Hope or Roston Chase. Post-lunch, however, with the new ball, the Indian pacers changed the template and used the bouncer more frequently, while continuing to surprise with fuller deliveries.As for the lead spinners, while Jadeja changed angles, came around the wicket with a slip and backward short leg in place, and attacked the stumps, Kuldeep (8/186 off 55.5 overs) also pulled his length back and immediately induced false strokes. Drift and dip were the left-arm wrist-spinner’s allies in neutralising the pitch.“We did a few different things depending on the batters,” allrounder Washington Sundar said. “For some, we tried to bowl wider and hit the rough. For others, we tried to be straight and bring the stumps into play. We were really patient. The England series taught us what it feels like to be on the field for five days.”Although the Kotla is unique in its bland nature, the Ahmedabad pitch in the first Test was also a departure from the norm. If India continue to persist with such wickets, skipper Shubman Gill and coach Gautam Gambhir may have a tactical rethink on home Tests.West Indies’ effort evoked memories of other batting marathons at the Kotla, notably the December 2015 fourth Test against South Africa, when, set an unlikely 481 to win, AB de Villiers batted 297 balls for his 43 and Hashim Amla 244 balls for his 25. They stretched India for 525 minutes and 143.1 overs before folding for 143.With South Africa due to visit next month, will the pitches in Kolkata and Guwahati offer early turn? “This is a typical Delhi wicket, where there is not much bounce and obviously, there wasn’t a lot of turn on offer,” Washington said. “But yeah, different venues play out differently and that’s the beauty of this format. We play in a lot of different conditions.”","West Indies bowled India out for 143 on Day Five of the second Test in New Delhi.

No Chance for West Indies? Fans upbeat about India's opening day domination | IND vs WI 1st Test

This second Test has unfolded like cinema in reverse, with the spoiler alert preceding some fascinating subplots. A series sweep awaits India on Tuesday but there were many small victories for West Indies along the way as they pushed the game to the last day, much to India’s annoyance.The likely result was never in doubt even before the series began, given one side’s relative superiority. However, at the end of a frustrating fourth day’s play for India, a resolution was still awaited as Shubman Gill’s men took stumps at 63/1 in the 18 possible overs of their second innings.The side still needs 58 more runs to win, having been unexpectedly pushed to the limits of their physical and mental endurance by a surprisingly resilient West Indies batting lineup on the sterile Ferozeshah Kotla pitch.The events of the day again highlighted India’s hubris in enforcing a follow-on after they had been forced to bowl 81.5 overs in the first innings amid a late-order resistance on a pitch gone comatose.On Monday, perennial pushovers West Indies continued to pull their weight with the bat, managing to keep India on the field for a staggering 200 overs across two innings. Along the way, there were strong signs of the side’s survivability, if not their revivability.Their second innings was punctuated by twin centuries from opener John Campbell (115 off 199 balls; 12x4, 2x6) — his first in Test cricket in a stop-start career marred by a drug ban — and Shai Hope (103 off 214; 12x4, 2x6), whose Test career prospects seemed all but extinguished after a prolonged lean patch in which he failed to breach three figures across 58 innings and eight years.The benign surface needed only application and patience against the quality Indian attack. It was the perfect time to rediscover qualities which had gone missing in West Indies cricket for a while. The two batters threw India’s composure and tactical acumen out of gear.In the morning session, Campbell and Hope played just 9.7% false shots, their lowest in the series. Campbell resumed on 87, having already done the hard work and ridden his luck, trusting his ability to sweep, play some decisive strokes down the ground, show attacking intent when cornered and survive some incredibly close umpire’s calls.He then entered unfamiliar territory in the 90s and was stuck on 94 for 10 deliveries. In a statement of intent, the Jamaican journeyman then reached the milestone with a six over long on off Ravindra Jadeja The spinner subsequently got back by trapping him in front as Campbell attempted an unnecessary reverse sweep, a shot he later termed a “misjudgment.” The calm Hope, meanwhile, got to his century off 204 balls in an innings characterised by sound defence and fierce concentration, but their dismissals again led to a flurry of wickets before the last wicket pitched camp.Kuldeep (3/104 off 29 in the second innings) got two wickets in three balls, that of Chase and Khary Pierre, but Justin Greaves (50*) and Jayden Seales contributed 79 for the last wicket to stifle India’s hopes of an early finish. Bumrah helped polish off the resolute tail.The day was marked by exhaustion for India and it showed in the way Yashasvi Jaiswal subsequently went for a quick finish and paid the price. India’s long day was punctuated by hoarse shouts of “ chalo, chalo chalo, mehnat karna padega , boys (let’s go, we have to work hard, boys)” from wicketkeeper Dhruv Jurel.The sustained effort, however, didn’t bring the quick breakthroughs India would have wanted on this pitch. The Test is in the bag but it was West Indies’ tenacity which was the story of the day.",West Indies reach 63/1 in their second innings at Ferozeshah Kotla. India still need 58 more runs to win.

Former Indian cricketer and current men's team head coach Gautam Gambhir celebrated his 44th birthday on Tuesday. Known for his crucial performances during critical moments, Gambhir served as one of India's most successful opening batsmen from 2003 to 2016, forming a formidable partnership with Virender Sehwag In his Test career spanning from 2004 to 2016, Gambhir played 58 matches, accumulating 4,154 runs at an average of 41.95. His record includes nine centuries and 22 fifties, with a highest score of 206.Gambhir's peak performance came during 2008-09, where he scored 1,861 runs in 13 Tests at an impressive average of 77.54, including seven centuries and seven fifties. This exceptional form earned him the ICC Test Player of the Year award in 2009.His remarkable 137-run innings against New Zealand in Napier, lasting 436 balls, helped India save the Test match and secure a 1-0 series victory. This performance is considered one of India's finest overseas achievements.In One Day Internationals, Gambhir played 147 matches between 2003 and 2013, scoring 5,238 runs at an average of 39.68, with 11 centuries and 34 fifties.During the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup , Gambhir emerged as India's second-highest run-scorer with 393 runs in nine innings, including four fifties.His crucial 97 runs in the final against Sri Lanka at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium helped India chase down 275 and win the World Cup after 28 years.In T20 Internationals, Gambhir scored 932 runs in 37 matches at an average of 27.41 and a strike rate exceeding 119. His memorable 75 against Pakistan in the 2007 ICC T20 World Cup final contributed to India's victory.Across all international formats, Gambhir amassed 10,324 runs in 242 matches at an average of 38.95, including 20 centuries and 63 fifties. He joins the elite group of 14 Indians with over 10,000 international runs.In the Indian Premier League, Gambhir led Kolkata Knight Riders to two titles in 2012 and 2014. He scored 4,217 runs in 154 matches at an average of 31.00 and a strike rate of nearly 124, including 36 fifties.After retiring, Gambhir found success as a mentor, guiding Lucknow Super Giants to playoffs in 2022 and 2023. He also contributed to KKR's title victory as a coach under Shreyas Iyer's captaincy.As India's head coach, Gambhir initially faced challenges with a Test series loss to New Zealand and Australia. However, he led a new-look Indian team to a 2-2 draw against England in the UK without senior players like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Ravichandran Ashwin.His Test coaching record shows six wins, eight losses, and two draws in 16 matches. In ODIs, after an early setback in Sri Lanka, India won the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 and secured victory against England at home.Under his coaching, India's T20I team has transformed significantly, winning the T20I Asia Cup undefeated and notably sweeping Pakistan in three matches, including the final. His T20I coaching record stands at 18 wins, two losses, and two ties, maintaining an unbeaten record in bilateral series.","Gautam Gambhir celebrated his 44th birthday on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Nadine de Klerk once again showcased her composure under pressure, guiding South Africa to a thrilling three-wicket victory over Bangladesh in the Women’s World Cup on Monday. Chasing 233, the Proteas appeared in trouble at 78 for five in the 23rd over. But veteran all-rounders Marizanne Kapp (56 off 71) and Chloe Tryon (62 off 69) staged a remarkable fightback, putting together an 85-run partnership for the sixth wicket. South Africa eventually reached their target with three balls to spare.De Klerk, who had earlier been dropped by Shorna Akter at long-off in the penultimate over, finished the innings with an unbeaten 37 off 29 balls, striking a four and a six to seal the win. This was another match-winning performance by the all-rounder, who had starred against India earlier in the tournament.Bangladesh’s innings had been anchored by a blistering 51 not out from 18-year-old Shorna Akter, who came in after a cautious start and propelled her team to 232 for six. Sharmin Akhter (50 off 77) and captain Nigar Sultana (32 off 42) had earlier added a steady 77-run partnership for the third wicket to keep Bangladesh competitive.The visitors had begun well, with left-arm spinner Nahida Akter removing opener Tazmin Brits for a golden duck, reducing South Africa to 3/1. Skipper Laura Wolvaardt (31 off 56) and Anneke Bosch (28 off 35) attempted to stabilize the innings with a 55-run stand, but a mix-up between the two batters saw Wolvaardt run out, opening the door for Bangladesh.Leg-spinner Rabeya Khan then struck to dismiss Annerie Dercksen, while Fahima Khatun removed Sinalo Jafta, leaving South Africa wobbling at 78 for five. However, de Klerk’s brilliance, combined with Kapp and Tryon’s resilience, turned the tide decisively in South Africa’s favour.Earlier, Bangladesh’s openers Fargana Hoque (30 off 76) and Rubya Haider (25 off 52) started cautiously, taking 16 overs to reach 50. Rubya’s attempted slog sweep against Chloe Tryon ended in a catch to de Klerk at mid-on, while Fargana was adjudged lbw to Nonkululeko Mlaba after a review. Sultana and Sharmin Akhter then fought back with crisp boundaries, keeping Bangladesh in the contest before the final surge faltered.In the end, South Africa’s experience and composure under pressure prevailed, with de Klerk’s finishing touch proving decisive in one of the most exciting encounters of the tournament.","Nadine de Klerk once again showcased her composure under pressure, guiding South Africa to a thrilling three-wicket victory over Bangladesh.

Poll Should KL Rahul have opted to retire hurt after his injury? Yes, it was a wise choice No, he should have continued batting

Indian opener KL Rahul faced a batter’s nightmare on Day 4 of the second Test against West Indies at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi. On Monday, Rahul was struck painfully on the protective box by a nearly 134 kph nip-backer from Jayden Seales, leaving him grimacing and falling near the pitch in visible agony.The incident occurred on the second ball of the third over, Rahul’s fifth of the innings. The right-hander was just a few milliseconds late, missing the line of the delivery, which beat his inside edge and hit flush on the groin. Rahul immediately dropped his bat, removed his helmet, and fell to the ground in excruciating pain.The physio attended to him for several minutes before he managed to get back on his feet. Demonstrating remarkable resilience, Rahul went on to score 25 off 54 balls and remained unbeaten at stumps.Alongside him, B Sai Sudharsan was unbeaten on 30, as India closed day four at 63/1 in 18 overs, chasing a modest target of 121. Despite the early dismissal of Yashasvi Jaiswal who scored 175 in the first innings, Rahul and Sudharsan ensured India were well-placed to chase down the remaining 58 runs on Day 5 and complete a 2-0 series sweep.The pitch offered slow bounce and some turn, but the two batters settled into a steady rhythm, negotiating both pace and spin without further setbacks.While the target was small, day four served as a reminder that Test cricket often delivers unexpected moments and challenges.Watch the video here Earlier, West Indies’ Justin Greaves and Jayden Seales had tested India’s patience. With India starting the session with just one slip and spread-out fields, Seales survived two difficult chances when Rahul and Dhruv Jurel failed to hold catches. Greaves reached his fifty before India’s decision to bring back Jasprit Bumrah paid dividends, as Seales flicked straight to deep square leg, ending a stubborn last-wicket partnership and concluding West Indies’ spirited innings.Though the visitors put up resistance, it was insufficient to prevent India from being on the cusp of a comfortable victory, with Day 5 expected to be a formality in securing the series.","KL Rahul faced a batter’s nightmare on Day 4 of the second Test against West Indies at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi.

Sai Sudharsan’s T20 Evolution: Where skill meets science | TOI Sports Exclusive

NEW DELHI: With the IPL 2026 Auction fast approaching, conversations around player retentions and possible trades are gaining momentum — and unexpectedly, Sai Sudharsan’s name has become the talk of the cricketing circles. The stylish left-handed batter from Tamil Nadu, currently representing Gujarat Titans, has found himself at the centre of growing buzz.A light-hearted moment during the India vs West Indies Test in Delhi only added to the chatter. On Day 3 at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, Sudharsan was seen sitting near the boundary ropes, enjoying a burger while tending to a sore hand after taking a sharp catch at short fine-leg.A fan-captured video of the moment quickly went viral on social media. In the clip, a voice can be heard saying, “Gujarat se nikal jao, CSK mein zarurat hai!” (Leave Gujarat Titans, we need you at CSK!).Given his Chennai upbringing and deep ties with Tamil Nadu cricket, Sudharsan has long been viewed as a natural fit for the Chennai Super Kings . And with reports suggesting the IPL 2026 mega auction is slated for mid-December, talk of a potential “homecoming” has gathered pace.Watch the video here Since joining Gujarat Titans in their debut season in 2022, Sudharsan has grown into one of the IPL’s most reliable young batters.Across 40 matches, he has scored 1,793 runs, often playing the anchor’s role in Gujarat’s batting order with poise and maturity.His standout campaign came in IPL 2025, when he won the Orange Cap after amassing a remarkable 759 runs in 15 games — a run that helped Gujarat reach the playoffs once again.Although Gujarat Titans have not made any official statement regarding a possible trade, Sudharsan’s stellar consistency, calm temperament, and Tamil Nadu roots make him an enticing prospect for Chennai Super Kings as they look to rebuild in the post-Dhoni era.","IPL 2026 Auction fast approaching, conversations around player retentions and possible trades are gaining momentum.

When was the last time a Test in India went into Day 5?



NEW DELHI: India were left with just 58 runs to seal a 2-0 series sweep as they reached 63-1 on Day 4 of the second Test against West Indies. KL Rahul was unbeaten on 25, while Sai Sudharsan held firm on 30 from 47 balls, hitting five boundaries. Yashasvi Jaiswal , who had scored a brilliant 175 in the first innings, was dismissed for eight as India chased 121 for victory. Although there was an option to extend play by 30 minutes, it wasn’t needed.West Indies made India toil in their second innings, with Shai Hope scoring his first Test century in eight years to help the visitors reach 390 in 118.5 overs. John Campbell also notched his maiden Test hundred, and a 79-run stand for the last wicket ensured India had to bat on Day 5.West Indies had scored 248 in their first innings in reply to India’s massive 518-5 declared, giving away a 270-run lead.In the morning session, Campbell, whose previous best was 68 against New Zealand in 2020, batted brilliantly alongside Hope. The pair added 177 runs, reducing India’s lead to just 18 at lunch. Campbell fell lbw to Ravindra Jadeja before the break, and Mohammed Siraj then removed Hope for 103, sparking a collapse. Kuldeep Yadav ran through the lower order, dismissing Tevin Imlach, Roston Chase, and Khary Pierre in quick succession to finish with eight wickets.West Indies reached 361-9 at tea after a 30-minute extension, with Justin Greaves (50) and Jaydon Seales (32) frustrating the tiring Indian bowlers before Jasprit Bumrah (3-44) wrapped up the innings.It was only the fourth time since 1961 that India had to bat again in a Test after enforcing the follow-on.Such extended contests are rare in India, a country where home conditions usually favour the hosts.The last Test in India to go the full five days was the opening match of the three-Test series against New Zealand in Bengaluru in 2024.Rain had washed out Day 1, and India were bowled out for just 46.New Zealand responded with 402, thanks to Rachin Ravindra’s brilliant 134 off 157 balls, and went on to win by eight wickets.Ravindra was named Player of the Match for his exceptional performance.","India left with just 58 runs to seal a 2-0 series sweep as they reach 63-1 on Day 4 of the second Test against West Indies.

Poll Do you think Ghana can make a deeper run than their 2010 quarter-finals berth at the 2026 World Cup? Yes, they have a strong team. No, the competition is tougher.

Ghana sealed their spot at the 2026 FIFA World Cup after a hard-fought 1-0 win over Comoros in Accra on Sunday, becoming the fifth African nation to qualify alongside Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia.Midfielder Mohammed Kudus was the hero for the Black Stars, scoring the only goal of the match just two minutes after half-time. A packed 40,000-strong home crowd roared as the Tottenham playmaker pounced on a loose ball in the six-yard box and tapped home following a goalmouth scramble.While Ghana dominated first-half possession, their slow and predictable approach meant Comoros goalkeeper Adel Anzimati-Aboudou was rarely tested. But Kudus’s early second-half strike settled the contest and erased memories of past heartbreaks — Comoros had stunned Ghana at the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations and again in the World Cup qualifiers two years ago.The victory saw Ghana top Group I with 25 points from 10 matches, ahead of Madagascar (19) and Mali (18). It marks Ghana’s fifth World Cup appearance, with their best showing coming in 2010 when they reached the quarter-finals in South Africa before losing to Uruguay on penalties.The result also vindicated Ghana’s decision to persist with coach Otto Addo, who was under pressure after the team’s disastrous 2025 AFCON qualifying campaign, where they finished last in their group without a win.Elsewhere, Egypt defeated Guinea-Bissau 1-0 in Cairo despite resting Mohamed Salah , while Niger shocked Zambia 1-0 to climb to third in the mini-league of second-placed teams.Four more automatic African qualifiers will be decided on Monday and Tuesday, with Benin, Cape Verde, Ivory Coast, and Senegal currently leading their respective groups as the race to the expanded 48-team World Cup heats up.",Ghana beat Comoros 1-0 to seal their place at the 2026 World Cup.

Erling Haaland continued his sensational form for Norway, scoring a hat-trick to surpass 50 international goals in record time as his team thrashed Israel 5-0 in Oslo on Saturday. The win edges Norway closer to their first World Cup finals since 1998.The match unfolded against the backdrop of political unrest, with hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators chanting “Free Palestine” to protest Israel’s actions in Gaza. Norwegian police used tear gas to disperse the crowd and made several arrests. Inside Ullevaal Stadium, a small group of Israeli fans waved flags and held a banner reading “Let the Ball Talk!”Norway now top Group I with 18 points, six ahead of second-placed Italy, who defeated Estonia 3-1 in Tallinn. The result leaves the Norwegians firmly in control as they aim for qualification for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Israel, meanwhile, will face Italy in Udine on Tuesday, needing a win to stay in contention.Haaland became the fastest player in men’s international football to reach 50 goals, now boasting 51 in just 46 games. His first penalty was saved by Israel goalkeeper Daniel Peretz, and even a retake was denied, but Norway surged ahead through an 18th-minute own goal by Anan Khalaili.Haaland added his first goal soon after, with Israel contributing another own goal through Idan Nachmias. He then completed the hat-trick with a header and a final nod-in, marking his sixth career international hat-trick. Cristiano Ronaldo had a penalty saved as Portugal narrowly beat the Republic of Ireland 1-0, with Ruben Neves scoring in injury time while honoring his late teammate Diogo Jota. Spain maintained a perfect qualifying record, defeating Georgia 2-0, while Turkey crushed Bulgaria 6-1. Albania claimed a historic 1-0 win at Serbia, keeping their World Cup hopes alive behind England in Group K.With the group stages heating up, Norway and Haaland appear unstoppable, but tense matchups, protests, and dramatic finishes across Europe ensure that the road to the 2026 World Cup will be anything but predictable.","Erling Haaland scores a hat-trick as Norway thrash Israel 5-0 in Oslo.

Germany, four-time World Cup winners, returned to winning ways on Friday, thrashing 10-man Luxembourg 4-0 to reclaim top spot in Group A.

An early own goal from Patrik Hrosovsky and a stunning late volley by Trai Hume secured the win. “It was a great night, good performance and the most important thing is the three points,” Hume said.In Paris, Kylian Mbappe continued his fine form at Parc des Princes, scoring just before halftime to mark his 10th goal in consecutive games for Real Madrid and France.

India are without a win at the halfway stage of the AFC Asian Cup 2027 final round qualifiers, but miraculously, they are not out of the race either.Reduced to ten men early in the second half after Sandesh Jhingan was sent off just after resumption, Khalid Jamil’s side was a minute away from a second consecutive loss, and almost out of contention. Singapore, however, blundered in the final minute of regulation time as Rahim Ali’s first international goal helped secure a 1-1 result in Singapore on Thursday.Singapore are still on top of the group with five points, three more than India’s two, but they will have a chance to make amends in the home clash next week. Hong Kong (four) and Bangladesh (one) have a game in hand.Only the group winners qualify for the Saudi Arabia edition.“I think it’s going to be difficult, we are just taking one game at a time,” Sunil Chhetri , who returned to the team after being left out for last month’s CAFA Nations Cup, said after the draw. “Going ten men and getting a result wasn’t easy. Just glad to be taking a point away.”Given the circumstances, India will be delighted with a point. When Ikhsan Fandi scored in first half stoppage time for Singapore and Jhingan was sent off for a second yellow, India were left with their backs against the wall.Chances were limited, and the hosts were in the ascendancy, only to blunder right at the end. Without a shot on goal till then and ineffective upfront, India could have only scored from a defensive lapse.India were thrown a lifeline in the 90th minute when Jordan Emaviwe casually played a ball back to goalkeeper Izwan Mahbud. Rahim pressed and the keeper’s clearance struck the feet of the India striker, who was left with an open goal to score his first international goal.For most part, Singapore were the better team, enjoying 63 % ball possession and plenty of looks at the India goal. The hosts had several chances, only to miss, twice from handshaking distance. Ilhan Fandi had two good chances in quick succession.At first, he shot wide, after being put under pressure by a sliding Rahul Bheke, while another attempt from a one-on-one situation with Gurpreet Singh Sandhu saw the keeper effect a good save.Even in the first half with everyone available, India never really posed a threat to the rival goal. Jamil chose to start with two men upfront – Chhetri, Farukh Choudhary – but without creativity in midfield, chances were in short supply.Then, with time running out, Jamil was forced into attacking changes: Udanta Singh, Sahal Abdul Samad and Rahim were all thrown into the mix, and India were ‘rewarded’ with a lucky goal to bring home a point.","Singapore draw 1-1 with India in AFC Asian Cup 2027 qualifier.

With qualification secured, coach Vladimir Petkovic substituted both scorers to manage the squad ahead of the final round of Group G fixtures.Algeria sit atop Group G with 22 points, four ahead of second-placed Uganda, and will make their fifth World Cup appearance in the United States, Canada, and Mexico next year. Their previous campaigns include first-round exits in 1982, 1986, and 2010, while they reached the second round in 2014 before losing 2-1 to eventual champions Germany.Notably, goalkeeper Luca Zidane, son of French legend Zinedine Zidane, made the squad after switching allegiance from France to Algeria.Elsewhere on the continent, Kenya defeated Burundi 1-0 in a fiery East African derby, with Ryan Ogam scoring the decisive goal. Burundi played almost the entire match with 10 men following a straight red card for Bonfils-Caleb Bimenyimana. The win lifted Kenya to third place in Group F, eight points behind leaders Ivory Coast, who can confirm their fourth World Cup spot with a win in their penultimate fixture.As Africa’s qualification race heats up, nine matches are scheduled Friday, including a crucial Group C round where Benin, South Africa, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Lesotho all remain in contention. With Algeria now guaranteed a place, attention shifts to the remaining spots, ensuring high-stakes drama across the continent’s qualifying groups.","Algeria secured their place in the 2026 FIFA World Cup on Thursday with a commanding 3-0 victory over Somalia.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

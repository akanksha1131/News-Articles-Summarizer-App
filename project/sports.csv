Before the Asia Cup, you lit up the UP T20 with your batting. Do you see that as the perfect preparation for the big tournament?



We’ve seen a few changes in your batting. Can you tell us more about them?

Gautam Gambhir has been a huge influence on your career — first at KKR and now as India’s head coach. How special is it to play under him again?



Did you get a chance to speak with him after your Asia Cup selection?

Gambhir often values players with all-round skills. Can we expect to see you contribute with the ball as well?

Poll Do you think Rinku Singh is primarily a T20 specialist? Yes, he excels in T20s No, he can play all formats

Is No. 7 your favourite batting position, or do you see yourself thriving elsewhere too?

Suryakumar Yadav is known for giving players plenty of freedom. How has your experience been under his leadership?

You’re often tagged as a T20 specialist ...

Looking back, do you think those five sixes in an over completely changed your career?

Do you consider yourself a strong contender for the T20 World Cup squad?

When it comes to your batting, where do ‘fear’ and ‘pressure’ fit in?

: Say Rinku Singh and the first couple of images are of breathtaking sixes, last-over thrillers, balls soaring over the bowler’s head, opposition captains holding their heads in disbelief, and crowds erupting in deafening cheers. The left-hander, who shot to fame after smashing five consecutive sixes in an IPL over, is often labelled a T20 specialist. But Rinku insists that while his power-hitting has made him a household name, he can also dig deep and bat in “defensive mode” when it comes to red-ball cricket.In 33 T20Is, Rinku has scored 546 runs at an average of 42.00 and a strike rate of over 160. Yet his domestic red-ball record tells an equally impressive story. The man known for sending bowlers on a leather hunt has played 50 first-class matches, amassing runs at a staggering average of 54.68, with seven centuries and 22 fifties to his name.Now preparing for the Asia Cup 2025, Rinku says his biggest dream is to don the whites for India in Test cricket.Rinku features in India’s 15-member Asia Cup squad and has been warming up in style. In the recently concluded UP T20, he collected 295 runs in nine matches, including a century and two fifties, stamping his authority ahead of the continental tournament.Ahead of the Asia Cup, to be played in the T20 format and starting on September 9 in the UAE, TimesofIndia.com caught up with Rinku for an exclusive conversation — on his evolving technique, playing under Suryakumar Yadav , guidance from Gautam Gambhir , life after the five sixes, and much more.The batting is going really well. It’s helping both the team and my confidence. I’m getting chances to bat in situations where I can take the team to victory. The position I’m batting at is one I really like, so it feels good to play there. I’m happy to have found rhythm and flow ahead of the Asia Cup. The ball is coming nicely onto the bat, and I’m really enjoying it.I’ve been training in Mumbai and practicing at the KKR Academy under Abhishek Nair sir. He has helped me a lot and asked me to now take my game to another level. T20 cricket is so demanding. Once you’ve played the IPL for a long time, bowlers start to understand your batting. That’s why you need to keep adding new elements to your game. You need to put runs on the board because the opposition also comes with the mindset of scoring heavily. I keep learning new things, like which shots I can add to my batting. After so many years in the IPL, bowlers know what weaknesses a batsman has, so I practice specifically on improving those areas. Practice has been really good. Yes, I’ve added a few more shots to my game. I’ve worked a lot on the sweep and reverse sweep. I’ve trained hard during this period, and I feel mentally and physically fit.GG sir (Gautam Gambhir) has always backed me and supported me a lot. When I first met him at KKR, he gave me so much confidence. I had a brief session with him where he spoke to me about pull shots. He always backs his players, and that feels really good. He’ll come, talk to you, and inject confidence. He’s a man with a lot of knowledge. I’ve enjoyed working with him—whether it’s batting, talking, or training. It’s always fun to share things with him. I’m really eager to play under his coaching again. It’s a special feeling to share the dressing room with a legend like GG sir.Not yet. Once I go to Dubai, I’ll have a big conversation with him (laughs). Till now, we haven’t spoken about anything. I’m just very excited to meet him and learn from him. His support in my career has been immense.Nowadays, every player is expected to contribute with both bat and ball. What else you can offer the team apart from your main skill is very important. If you are a batter and the captain gives you the ball and you manage to take a couple of wickets, there’s nothing better than that. It helps you and the team as well. If needed, I can bowl and pick up wickets too. Even selectors look at whether a player can contribute in both departments, so it definitely adds value. There’s no harm in it — it’s always for the team’s good. As a batter, if the captain hands me the ball in a particular situation and I take wickets, it’s a big plus for the team.My approach remains the same, no matter what position I come in to bat. That won’t change in the Asia Cup either. By God’s grace, I’ve been scoring runs, and I want to carry the same confidence into the tournament. If I get the chance to feature in the eleven, I’m ready to bat anywhere — whether at 6 or 7, or even higher up in the middle overs. It’s not that I can only bat down the order; I can play wherever India needs me. I always analyse the situation and bat accordingly, and I really enjoy being in crunch and tense situations.Surya bhai is a fantastic captain. In all the games I’ve played for India, he has supported me a lot. He always tells me to play the same way I’ve been playing in the IPL. He takes the pressure off and gives me confidence. He reminds me that playing for India is a big achievement, and that I must have done something special to get here. For him, it’s all about mindset. He makes players feel comfortable so that no one feels out of place or under pressure. That’s what makes him so special — he’s truly a players’ captain.I know fans love it when I hit sixes, and I’m really grateful for that. But my Ranji Trophy average is also very good — I average over 55 there. I really enjoy playing red-ball cricket. I’ve also played two ODIs for India and did well in one of them. So, it’s not like I’m only a T20 player. I believe I can perform in every format if I get the chance. I don’t like being tagged as a one-format player; I see myself as an all-format player. My dream is to play Test cricket for India, and if I get the opportunity, I’ll be ready to grab it.Suresh Raina bhaiya is my idol. He always tells me, “Rinku, be ready and prepared for everything.” I’d be very happy to play Tests for India and contribute there too. Raina bhaiya has played most of his matches at the position where I bat, and he has produced many match-winning knocks. I want to be the same kind of player for India across all formats.Yes, people know me because of that match, and since then expectations have gone up a lot. I’ve received so much love from everyone. After those five sixes, I got a different identity altogether — not just for myself, but for the whole of India. For me, it was a huge moment. The team needed 28 runs, and then five sixes came in a row. It was like a dream — these things don’t happen every day. It happened to me, and I’m thankful to the Almighty for that. All the hard work I had put in over the years felt rewarded in that one innings. In that moment, I felt God gave me everything.Yes, my dream is to be part of the World Cup squad and to hold that trophy. I keep praying to God for that. If I perform well in the upcoming series, things will become clearer for the World Cup. That’s my ultimate aim — to do well for my country in the Asia Cup, and I’m confident I will deliver.Pressure is always part of the game, but the most important thing is belief. If you believe in yourself, it doesn’t matter who the bowler is. Hard work and confidence make things easier. If you play with fear, everything goes wrong. But if you believe, anything is possible. That’s the mindset I carry every time I walk out to bat.",Rinku Singh is fit and available for fourth T20I against England.

FIDE Rating List

Five-year-old Aarini Lahoty has carved her name into Indian chess history by becoming the country’s youngest player to earn FIDE ratings across all three formats - classical, rapid, and blitz.The Delhi girl now holds ratings of 1553 in classical, 1550 in rapid, and 1498 in blitz, becoming the first 2019-born chess player from India to do so.“We prepared her at home itself. We made her play tournaments in all formats, tried to get her used to the same time patterns, and only then sent her for official tournaments. Now her ratings have been published, we are very happy,” her father and coach, Surendar Lahoty, told TimesofIndia.com after FIDE released the ratings on Sunday.Born on September 19, 2019, Aarini had already become India’s highest-rated player in her age group in August, across boys and girls, among those born after 2019.""In Rapid, the format was 15+10, and in Blitz, it was 3+2. At home, we kept practising with the same time controls to prepare her for tournaments. And even at this minute, if I ask her to play a tournament, she’s ready to go with me. In fact, today she played a local tournament where she won the Under-7 category and finished second in Under-16,"" he added.In her age group, while some players have got rapid ratings, Aarini is the first 2019-born to hold FIDE ratings in all three formats.Surendar, who runs the IGSF Chess Academy in Delhi and teaches physical education at Bluebells School International, recalled, “From the age of one, she would set up the board herself. During lockdown, she watched me teach online and started moving the pieces correctly on her own.”With Indian chess in its golden era, Aarini represents the youngest wave of the boom.Surendar is clear about her path ahead: “We want her to become India’s youngest IM and GM, and make everyone proud.”","Five-year-old Aarini Lahoty is the first 2019-born chess player from India to do so.

Jasprit Bumrah should skip IPL for five-match Test series? Former India bowling coach weighs in

Poll Do you consider Jasprit Bumrah to be a modern-day great bowler? Absolutely Somewhat Not really Not at all

Legendary Pakistan fast bowler Wasim Akram has heaped praise on India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah , calling him a ""modern-day great."" He also credited the Indian team management for handling Bumrah’s workload with remarkable precision.“Jasprit Bumrah is a world-class bowler, no doubt about it,” Akram said on the show Hasna Mana Hai.“He has a very unusual action, he has pace, and the way India is managing him is incredible. Full credit to the management and their mindset.”When asked if Bumrah was an all-time great, Akram replied: “One should not compare eras. He is a right-arm fast bowler, I was a left-arm quick. I’ve seen debates on social media, but neither he cares nor do I. He is a modern great. I did my bit in my time, but he is very impressive.”Reflecting on the challenges of modern cricket, Akram added: “In the 90s, there was no T20. In ODIs, batters often left bad balls, but now even good balls in Tests get hammered. There’s much more pressure on bowlers these days. Jasprit has more chances of picking wickets since batters are always looking for shots. As bowlers, we enjoy that aggression.”Sharing his views on the proposed two-tier system in the World Test Championship (WTC), Akram expressed his disapproval.“If Pakistan, West Indies, and Bangladesh keep playing among themselves, how will they improve?” he said. “I don’t agree with the two-tier system. Test cricket needs quality teams. There’s no point in letting associate teams play Tests before developing their first-class structure.”","Wasim Akram has heaped praise on India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah.

Team India Head Coach Gautam Gambhir and former India star Virender Sehwag were honoured at the Delhi Premier League 2025 final, held at Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday. The DDCA felicitated both for their unforgettable contributions to Indian cricket, with president Rohan Jaitley presenting the awards.On the field, West Delhi Lions claimed the title with a six-wicket victory over Central Delhi Kings. Captain Nitish Rana starred with an unbeaten 79 to guide his team in successfully chasing a target of 174 runs.Early wickets by Central Delhi Kings’ Simarjeet Singh and Arun Pundir reduced the Lions to 48/3 in the fifth over, but Rana stabilised the innings alongside Mayank Gusain with a 42-run partnership before Gusain fell for 15. Hrithik Shokeen then joined Rana, and their unbroken partnership sealed the win. Shokeen contributed 42* off 27 balls, complementing Rana’s dominant display.Central Delhi Kings had earlier recovered from 78/6 to post 173/7, thanks to a vital seventh-wicket stand between Yugal Saini (65 off 48 balls) and Pranshu Vijayran (50* off 24 deliveries).West Delhi Lions’ bowlers were key in keeping the target achievable.Manan Bhardwaj led the attack with figures of 2/11 in 3 overs, while Shivank Vashisht took 2/12 in 2 overs. Rana also chipped in with 1/16 in his four overs.Rana’s consistent performance in the playoffs was remarkable, scoring 134* in the Eliminator, 45* in Qualifier 2, and 79* in the Final. His leadership, combined with Shokeen’s support, proved decisive in securing the Lions’ title.The felicitation of Gambhir and Sehwag added a celebratory tone to the final, recognising their lasting impact on Indian cricket.

Sports memorabilia carry immense emotional, cultural, and historical value, often transcending sport itself. Cricket, with its rich heritage, has produced some of the most treasured artefacts ever auctioned. From iconic bats to legendary baggy greens, these prized possessions not only capture unforgettable moments on the field but also command staggering sums under the hammer.In 2020, Shane Warne stunned the cricketing world by auctioning his treasured Baggy Green cap to raise funds for the Australian bushfire appeal. The cap eventually fetched an extraordinary A$1,007,500, bought by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The bank ensured it wasn't locked away but displayed nationwide to raise more money for the cause. Today, the cap rests at the Bradman Museum in Bowral, immortalising Warne's generosity as much as his unmatched spin wizardry.Bradman's first Test cap, worn in the 1928-29 series against England, remains one of the most significant items in cricket history.Symbolising the humble beginning of a career that would later define cricketing greatness, this rare artefact was auctioned in 2020 for nearly A$450,000. Collectors see it as the genesis of “The Don's” incredible journey, from a young debutant to the greatest batsman the sport has ever seen, with an immortal average of 99.94.The National Museum of Australia recently secured a piece of cricket's greatest legacy — Sir Donald Bradman's Baggy Green worn during the 1946–47 Ashes series. The Don amassed 680 runs in that series, averaging a staggering 97.14. Auctioned for A$438,500, this cap is among just 11 Bradman baggy greens known to exist. It represents not only his cricketing genius but also Australia's post-war revival, making it a national treasure beyond monetary value.Bradman's Baggy Green from his farewell tour of England in 1948 — famously known as the “Invincibles” tour — is another priceless relic. It was during this tour that he needed just four runs to secure a Test average of 100 but was bowled for a duck in his final innings. The cap sold in 2003 for £170,000 to a UK-based collector. More than memorabilia, it is a poignant reminder of cricket's most human moment.Few sporting memories stir as much emotion as MS Dhoni's six that sealed India's 2011 World Cup triumph after 28 years. The bat used in that iconic moment was auctioned for £100,000, bought by R K Global Shares & Securities Ltd. At the time, it became the most expensive cricket bat ever sold. Beyond its price, the willow represents national pride, Dhoni's legendary calmness under pressure, and a generation's most cherished sporting memory.Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack is often called the “Bible of Cricket,” and a complete set covering its first 144 editions (1864–2007) was sold for a whopping £84,000 in 2008. The collection included rare index issues, making it highly desirable for cricket historians and collectors alike. Beyond its market value, the Almanack is a time capsule of cricketing history — chronicling the evolution of the game from its early days to the modern professional era.In 1968, Sir Garfield Sobers etched his name into cricket folklore by hitting six consecutive sixes in an over against Glamorgan's Malcolm Nash in a first-class match. The bat that delivered those historic blows was auctioned in 2000, fetching £54,257. For fans, it symbolises the audacity and power of Sobers, arguably cricket's greatest all-rounder. The sale not only honoured the record itself but also preserved the spirit of attacking cricket Sobers embodied.Before Brian Lara broke it decades later, Sobers' monumental 365 against Pakistan in 1958 stood as the highest individual Test score for 36 years. The bat with which he achieved this feat was auctioned in 2000 for £47,475. More than just wood and leather, this willow embodies the brilliance of Sobers' strokeplay and his ability to dominate bowling attacks. For collectors, it remains one of the purest connections to Test cricket's golden records.These jaw-dropping auction figures prove that cricketing history isn't just about numbers on a scorecard. From Bradman to Dhoni to Warne, these artefacts are priceless bridges between generations — symbols of sporting greatness preserved forever.","Sports memorabilia carry immense emotional, cultural, and historical value.

India cricketers eye Test berths with Duleep Trophy | All eyes on Mohammed Shami and other pacers

MUMBAI: Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar 's annual party, postponed after being initially planned in May because of a war-like situation between India and neighbours Pakistan, finally happened at the Mumbai Cricket Association's Bandra-Kurla Complex Recreation Club on Sunday night. Incidentally, it turned out to be the same day when India's Test batting stalwart Cheteshwar Pujara announced his retirement from cricket.Just a day earlier (on August 23), Gavaskar and former ICC, BCCI , and MCA president Sharad Pawar had unveiled a statue of himself at the entrance of the MCA's Sharad Pawar Cricket Museum.Gavaskar's fierce patriotism came to the fore when the invitation card for the party itself mentioned that the event was being held to ""celebrate the success of Operation Sindoor and the performance of the Indian cricket team in England, which has won the hearts of all Indians."" Operation Sindoor was India's substantial response to Pakistan in the wake of the Pahalgam attacks on April 22. While led by a young, debutant captain in Shubman Gill, India, against all expectations, drew a hard-fought series against England 2-2 while playing some thoroughly entertaining and magnificent cricket.On the occasion, Gavaskar didn't forget to remember his old childhood friends who had departed and were a regular feature at his annual event.At the entrance of the hall, Gavaskar remembered all his childhood friends and former Mumbai teammates Milind Rege, Ehsan Hakim, Vijay Karkhanis, Padmakar Shivalkar, Abdul Ismail and his India teammate Dilip Doshi, with their names inscribed on miniature bats.Present on the occasion was former India captain Nari Contractor, who is 91 now. However, three other cricketers of yesteryear who are all in their 90s — ex-India allrounder Chandu Borde, ex-India ‘keeper Chandu Patankar, and former Rajasthan leg-spinner Chandu Joshi — couldn’t make it due to health reasons. Apparently, Joshi started off from Pune for the party, but had to return from Lonavala as he wasn’t feeling well.The guests at the do included Dilip Vengsarkar, India's 1983 World Cup heroes Sandeep Patil and Balwinder Singh Sandhu, former India wicketkeeper and ex-Kolkata Knight Riders and current Madhya Pradesh head coach Chandrakant Pandit, ex-India players Pravin Amre, Raju Kulkarni, Yajurvindra Singh Bilkha and Jatin Paranjape. Ex-India seamer-turned-commentator Irfan Pathan's presence attracted eyeballs too.In a video message, Gavaskar said, “What a wonderful last 10 days it has been! On August 15, which was our 78th Independence Day, it also happened to be my mother's 100th birth anniversary. Our family got together, it was such a fun evening. I'm pretty certain that my parents, my mother, looking from the heavens above, would have also had fun seeing practically the whole family get together to celebrate her 100th birthday. ”“And then a few days later, my statue was unveiled at the Wankhede Stadium, something which I had not even dreamt of when I started playing cricket in the Bhagirathi buildings. And the day after that, we got together to celebrate Operation Sindoor and the young Indian team's performance in England. It was the annual get-together that I generally have for all those whom I have played with right from school, college, club, and Ranji Trophy level, so it was also such a wonderful evening. I can't be thankful enough to God almighty to have the opportunity to have a get-together and celebrate all three occasions with all my family and friends. Normally, it is Milind and Anil Joshi (Gavaskar’s old friend) who organise everything, but this time I’m thankful to Anil for organising the party. We missed Milind Rege, Abdul bhai Ismail, my skipper ‘Papa’ Karkhanis, ‘Paddy’ Shivalkar, and Dilip Doshi. We also missed some others who couldn’t make it.”As usual, Gavaskar's party didn't have any speeches or loud music, just some precious anecdotes that went perfectly with the alcohol and some highly delicious food that was served right through the evening.",Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar held his annual party on Sunday night.

A piece of Australian sporting history has found a permanent home, after a cricket cap worn by Sir Donald Bradman during the 1946-47 Ashes series was bought by the National Museum of Australia in Canberra for AU$438,500 (approx. US$286,700).The federal government covered half the purchase cost, with Arts Minister Tony Burke hailing the acquisition as vital for safeguarding a national treasure.“You’d be hard-pressed to meet an Australian that hasn’t heard of the great Donald Bradman, arguably the greatest cricketer of all time,” Burke said. “Now to have one of his iconic baggy greens in the National Museum of Australia means visitors will have the opportunity to get up close and connect with our sporting and cultural history.”Bradman wore the cap as captain in the 1946-47 Ashes series – the first Test contest between Australia and England after World War II – scoring 680 runs at a staggering average of 97.14 to lead his team to a 3-0 victory.

Paris Olympics 2024: Neeraj Chopra Wins Silver, Pak's Arshad Nadeem Breaks Record | 'Also Our Son'

Two-time Olympic medallist Neeraj Chopra had to settle for a runner-up finish in the Diamond League Final for the third year in a row as Germany’s Julian Weber produced a commanding performance to win his maiden title with two massive 90m-plus throws in Zurich on Thursday.Weber lit up the event with a season world-leading 91.57m effort, also his personal best, coming in the second round. He had already set the tone with 91.37m in his opening attempt, and from there it was a one-man show. None of his rivals came close to the German, whose five legal throws all went beyond 83m, underlining his dominance in the seven-man field.Chopra, meanwhile, had an uncharacteristically modest series. The 27-year-old Indian began with 84.35m and then slipped with efforts of 82m and a foul. At the halfway stage, he was placed third behind Trinidad and Tobago’s Keshorn Walcott. Two more fouls followed before he salvaged his night with a final-round 85.01m to snatch back second place, edging Walcott by just six centimeters. Defending champion Anderson Peters of Grenada finished fourth with 82.06m.“This was not too bad,” Chopra reflected after the event. “We are getting close to the world championships, so I still need to throw a little further.A few things went well, a few things did not. But I am very happy for Julian – he managed to throw really far. Showing 91m was really good.”The modest return was a rare off-day for Chopra, who has made a habit of breaching the 88m mark in recent seasons and famously crossed the 90m barrier earlier this year in Doha. He acknowledged that the focus now shifts to Tokyo, where he will defend his world title next month. “At major championships, the gold is more important than the far throws. So I will try my best to win the medal,” he said.For Weber, it was another breakthrough in a season where he has already thrown over 90m three times, including his 91.06m effort in Doha in May. Thursday’s win also gave him a 3-1 edge over Chopra in head-to-head contests this season, although the Indian still holds a dominant 15-5 overall record.Chopra has not finished outside the top two in any competition since June 2021. But on the biggest Diamond League stage, Weber’s night of brilliance ensured the Indian star had to settle for second best yet again.",Two-time Olympic medallist Neeraj Chopra had to settle for a runner-up finish in the Diamond League Final for the third year in a row.

(Instagram)

Tourism Australia has launched a new version of its ""Come and Say G'day"" campaign specifically targeting the Indian audiences. The new campaign features Sara Tendulkar , daughter of cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar , alongside Ruby the Souvenir Kangaroo, an animated character. It is a $130 million initiative aiming to increase Indian tourists' visit to Australia, capitalising on the market's impressive growth with visitor arrivals exceeding 450,000 and spending reaching $2.7 billion.The new tourism campaign's success builds on strong momentum in the Indian market. Nishant Kashikar, Tourism Australia's country manager for India and the Gulf, reports that Indian visitor numbers are up 8% from last year. Even more impressive is the 21% increase in overnight stays, totalling 29 million nights, and a 14% jump in spending by Indian tourists.Sara Tendulkar's selection as brand ambassador wasn't random. She has a long-standing connection with Australia, having visited the country since childhood. ""Sara has been visiting Australia ever since she was a kid, over the past couple of decades, and therefore, as a result of the trip, she's developed that natural affinity and an emotional connect with Australia,"" explains Kashikar.The 27-year-old Sara Tendulkar brings more than just star power to the role. ""For me, the 'Come and Say G'day' campaign goes beyond tourism. It's about sharing stories of the places that shape you,"" she told NDTV. Her Instagram posts showcase various Australian experiences, including a nostalgic visit to the Melbourne Cricket Ground.Sara's engagement with the campaign reflects her personal philosophy about travel. ""Travel is about discovery, culture, food, and the interesting people you meet along the way,"" she shared.""That's the kind of work I want to keep doing - something that connects people and creates lasting impressions that stay with you long after the holiday.""Tourism Australia sees huge potential in the Indian market. They aim to attract 500,000 Indian visitors by next year. This goal seems achievable given India's position as one of the world's fastest-growing economies and expanding aviation connections between the two countries.","Tourism Australia has launched a new version of its ""Come and Say G'day"" campaign specifically targeting the Indian audiences.

Poll Is it more important for a fast bowler to focus on speed or accuracy? Speed Accuracy Both are equally important

Bengaluru: Mohammed Shami is barely a week away from his 35th birthday and much slower than he once was, but the fire within hasn’t dimmed. Neither has the tenacity to fight. With several of his illustrious teammates having called it a day in recent times, Shami has received many not-so-subtle hints to walk off into the sunset.But the premier fast bowler isn’t throwing in the towel just yet, and as he reiterated just a couple of days ago, “The day I get bored, I will leave. You don’t pick me, don’t play me, I don’t care. But I will keep working hard.”Arguably one of India’s finest pace-bowling exponents, Shami has his focus set on the 2027 50-over World Cup. Mentally, he is all there. The question is, will his body hold up? His last appearance in the ODI format, after all, was in the Champions Trophy final in Dubai in March earlier this year.Playing in his first competitive red-ball game since Nov 2024, the Bengal pacer was slow but not rusty in the Duleep Trophy tie between East and North Zone at the BCCI Centre of Excellence here on Thursday. He bowled 17 overs spread over four spells, focusing more on accuracy rather than speed, on a surface that offered considerable bounce but little seam movement.He was effective but not incisive, looking primarily to test his injury-ravaged body.In his first spell of five overs, his inswingers from good length troubled the right-handers — openers Shubham Khajuria and Ankit Kumar, in particular — while his next spell of three overs was rather uneventful, barring a few edges towards fine leg.Post lunch, Shami switched ends and gears. He appeared to have assessed the conditions to his satisfaction, and his third spell of 4-2-9-0 was his best of the day. Shami was more probing, as he tempted Ayush Badoni and Yash Dhull in the corridor outside off. He finally struck late in the day with a delivery that sent back Sahil Lotra.Shami continued the probing line and in the 70th over, Lotra offered a thick edge to wicketkeeper Kumar Kushagra. The catch was redemption for Kushagra, who had earlier dropped Kanhaiya Wadhwan off Shami. With rain ensuring an early end, it will be interesting to see how Shami and his new-ball partner Mukesh Kumar , who went out for nine overs due to a niggle, fare on a moist surface.","Mohammed Shami played in his first competitive red-ball game since Nov 2024.

'Never Dreamt of This...': Rohit Sharma's BIG CONFESSION After Retirement From Test Cricket

What is the Bronco Test?

Former India cricketer Manoj Tiwary has made a striking claim about the introduction of the Bronco Test in Indian cricket, suggesting it could be aimed at keeping Rohit Sharma out of the team. The new fitness benchmark, implemented under India’s strength and conditioning coach Adrian Le Roux, adds to the existing Yo-Yo and 2-kilometre time trial tests that players must meet.Speaking to Crictracker, Tiwary raised questions about the timing and purpose of the test, particularly as India prepares for a transitional phase ahead of the 2027 World Cup. ""I think it will be very difficult to keep Virat Kohli out of the plans for the 2027 World Cup, but I have doubts about Rohit Sharma. I believe the Bronco Test has been introduced for players like him. It seems designed to make it difficult for some senior players to stay in the team,"" Tiwary said.Tiwary also highlighted that Rohit could struggle to re-enter the ODI setup if his fitness standards are not up to the mark. He questioned why the test was introduced at this particular time rather than at the start of the new head coach’s tenure. ""Why now? Who decided to bring in the Bronco Test? It is hard to say, but the observation is that players like Rohit will find it challenging if they do not work hard on their fitness,"" he added.Drawing parallels with past phases in Indian cricket, Tiwary said similar fitness benchmarks have previously sidelined senior players. ""When legends like Gambhir, Sehwag, and Yuvraj were performing well, the Yo-Yo Test was introduced after the 2011 World Cup. Fitness standards have often been used to shape team selection,"" he explained.The Bronco Test is an endurance-focused fitness challenge commonly used in sports like rugby. Unlike the Yo-Yo Test, which allows short recovery breaks, the Bronco Test requires players to complete continuous shuttle runs of 20 metres, 40 metres, and 60 metres, repeated five times without a pause, covering a total of 1,200 metres. Top-level Indian cricketers are expected to complete it in around six minutes.For context, the Yo-Yo Test is a 20-metre shuttle run with increasing speed and ten-second recovery intervals, with a minimum pass mark of 17.1. The 2-kilometre time trial requires fast bowlers to finish in 8 minutes 15 seconds and batters, spinners, and wicketkeepers in 8 minutes 30 seconds.The decision to implement the Bronco Test reportedly followed concerns over endurance levels during India’s recent five-Test tour of England. Among the fast bowlers, only Mohammed Siraj managed to play all five matches, highlighting potential gaps in fitness.",Former India cricketer Manoj Tiwary questions the purpose of the Bronco Test.

I want to play on the global stage the way I played street cricket,” he said.Beyond cricket, Ashwin emphasised living life on his terms. “My thing is I want to live my life on my terms for my happiness.

Poll Do you think West Delhi Lions could have won without Nitish Rana's performance? Yes, they had a strong team No, he was crucial to their success

West Delhi Lions claimed the Delhi Premier League 2025 title with a commanding six-wicket win over Central Delhi Kings in the final at Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday. Captain Nitish Rana played a brilliant unbeaten 79 to guide his team in successfully chasing a target of 174 runs, capping off a stellar tournament performance.The chase, however, did not start smoothly for the Lions. Early breakthroughs by Central Delhi Kings’ bowlers Simarjeet Singh and Arun Pundir reduced the Lions to 48/3 in the fifth over. Rana, as he had throughout the tournament, anchored the innings. He shared a 42-run partnership with Mayank Gusain, who contributed 15 before falling, stabilising the chase after the early losses.Hrithik Shokeen then walked in and joined Rana in an unbroken partnership that saw the Lions through. Shokeen played a fluent 42 off 27 balls, while Rana continued to dominate the bowling attack, displaying his trademark aggression and composure under pressure.Earlier, Central Delhi Kings, after being reduced to 78/6, were revived by a vital seventh-wicket stand. Yugal Saini and Pranshu Vijayran added 78 runs together, with Saini scoring 65 off 48 balls and Vijayran remaining unbeaten on 50 from just 24 deliveries.Their partnership brought respectability to Kings’ total of 173/7 in 20 overs, giving the Lions a challenging yet achievable target.The Lions’ bowlers were equally impressive. Manan Bhardwaj led the attack with figures of 2/11 in 3 overs, supported by Shivank Vashisht’s 2/12 in 2 overs. Rana also contributed with the ball, picking up 1/16 in his full quota.Rana’s consistency throughout the playoffs was remarkable. He scored 134* in the Eliminator, 45* in Qualifier 2, and 79* in the Final. His all-round leadership, both as a captain and a player, was key to West Delhi Lions’ title triumph, making him the standout performer of the Delhi Premier League 2025.","West Delhi Lions claimed the Delhi Premier League 2025 title with a commanding six-wicket win over Central Delhi Kings in the final.

Former India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin , who retired from international cricket last December and from the IPL last week, has expressed interest in featuring in the fourth season of the UAE’s International League T20 (ILT20).

Hopefully, I will have a buyer if I register for the auction,” Ashwin told Cricbuzz, confirming his interest.If picked, Ashwin would become the biggest name from Indian cricket to feature in the ILT20, now in its fourth season. Robin Uthappa and Yusuf Pathan have previously played in the league, while Ambati Rayudu represented MI Emirates in eight matches.Ashwin brings an extensive T20 resume, having featured in 221 IPL matches across five franchises.

BENGALURU: With some players returning from injury and others playing competitive cricket after a hiatus, the focus was on shielding players from injury while also ensuring game time rather than pushing for outright wins in the Duleep Trophy quarterfinal.North Zone progressed to the semifinals by virtue of their first innings lead against East Zone, the draw being agreed some 30 minutes before tea on Sunday, the final day, at the BCCI Centre of Excellence.The teams shook hands just after Ayush Badoni secured a double century (204 n.o; 223b; 13x4; 3x6) and North declared their second innings at 658/4 in 146.2 — a mammoth 833-run lead. Ankit Kumar and his men now face South Zone in the semifinal.Earlier in the day, resuming from an overnight 168, skipper Ankit looked comfortably on course to scoring his maiden first-class double century, but the rush to achieve the 200-mark saw him miscue a pull off Mukhtar Hussain, which Suraj Jaiswal took at mid-on.At the other end, Badoni hardly put a foot wrong as he clinically went about dismantling a beleaguered East bowling attack. Their lead pacers, Mohammed Shami and Mukesh Kumar , did not take the field.While Shami hurt a toe on Day 3 and didn't bowl in the final session on Saturday onwards, Mukesh sat out of the second innings due to a niggle sustained in the first innings. This put pressure on the other bowlers and skipper Riyan Parag, returning from a shoulder injury, was forced to roll his arm over.Badoni too appeared keen to get off the pitch and put his feet up and he secured his century off 123 deliveries, reaching the mark with a boundary and he took lesser deliveries (99 balls) en route to the double ton.Admitting a win was not on their mind, Ankit said, “We could have gone for a result because we had the upper hand. But we didn't try because we had the lead in the first innings.""On not declaring, he suggested he wanted to conserve Asia Cup-bound bowlers. “We wanted to keep Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana as fresh as possible,"" he said.At the adjoining ground, Central, who sealed their last-four berth against West with a 347-run first innings lead, played out the day with NorthEast denying them an outright victory. NorthEast finished on 200/6 in their second innings.Spinner Kuldeep Yadav , who is a part of the Asia Cup squad, bowled 32 overs across two innings and went wicketless.With Tilak Varma heading to Dubai for the Asia Cup, South Zone will be led by Kerala skipper Mohammed Azharuddin. Tamil Nadu spinner Sai Kishore, who sustained a hand injury while fielding during a local league match has been replaced with Andhra leggie Shaik Rasheed, while Puducherry's Ankit Sharma will take Varma's place in the line-up.Brief scores: North Zone 405 & 658/4 decl in 146.2 overs (Ankit Kumar 198, Yash Dhull 133, Ayush Badoni 204 n.o, Nishant Sindhu 68) drew with East Zone: 230.Central Zone: 532/4 decl & 331/7 decl drew with NorthEast: 185 & 200/6 in 58 overs (Jehu Anderson 64, R Jonathan 60; Harsh Dubey 2-53, Aditya Thakare 2-21, Shubham Sharma 2-10)",North Zone progress to semifinals by virtue of their first innings lead against East Zone. Ayush Badoni secured a double century (204 n.o; 223b; 13x4; 3x6) and North declared their second innings at 658/4 in 146.2.

Tilak Varma ruled out; Azharuddeen to lead South Zone

MUMBAI: In a big blow to his aspirations ahead of India's home Test season, set to kick off against West Indies in October, Mumbai's middle-order batsman Sarfaraz Khan , who recently cracked two back-to-back centuries in the Buchi Babu Tournament in Chennai, has been ruled out of the Duleep Trophy due to an injury.Sarfaraz was set to turn out for defending champions West Zone in their semifinal clash against Central Zone, starting September 4 at the BCCI's CoE in Bengaluru.""Sarfaraz is suffering from a quadriceps injury, which he picked up while scoring a century against Haryana in the Buchi Babu event five days ago. He's set to be out for almost three weeks, and is currently rehabilitating at the CoE,"" a source confirmed to TOI on Sunday. Sarfaraz is likely to be replaced by Baroda batter Shivalik Sharma, who was named among the reserves for West Zone in the tournament. Shivalik has scored 1,087 runs in 18 first-class matches at an average of 43.48, with three hundreds and five fifties. He scored 484 runs in seven matches last season at 44.00, with one hundred and three fifties.The 27-year-old Sarfaraz, who was snubbed from India's Test tour of England this summer, had shown fine form in the Buchi Babu, scoring a run-a-ball 111 against Haryana and an aggressive 114-ball 138 against TNCA XI in Mumbai's opening match of the tournament.Meanwhile, India's Test wicketkeeper Dhruv Jurel, who was named as the captain of the Central Zone side in the Duleep Trophy but missed the opening match against North East due to a groin injury, has also been ruled out of the semifinal clash against West Zone from September 4, TOI has learnt. Jurel has been replaced by his fellow Uttar Pradesh wicketkeeper Upendra Yadav in the Central Zone side. The other change in the Central side is that India's chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav, set to report to Dubai on India duty for the Asia Cup, has been replaced by Vidarbha pacer Yash Thakur.In another development, South Zone have announced a major change in their squad for the Duleep Trophy semifinal against North Zone from September 4. Captain Tilak Varma will not be participating, as the match begins on the same day Team India departs for the T20 Asia Cup scheduled in the UAE.Mohammed Azharuddeen of Kerala, who was earlier named the vice-captain of the team, will now lead South Zone in Varma's absence, with Tamil Nadu's wicketkeeper-batsman N Jagadeesan, who was recently flown to England as a replacement for the injured Rishabh Pant for the fifth Test against the hosts, as his deputy.Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu's left-arm spinner Sai Kishore has also been ruled out owing to a finger injury.","Sarfaraz Khan ruled out of Duleep Trophy due to quadriceps injury.

NEW DELHI: Riyan Parag ’s main aim at the Duleep Trophy was to get some much-needed game time after managing a shoulder injury for most of the season, and the Assam all-rounder was satisfied to have achieved that. The injury, which he picked up late last year, continued to trouble him during IPL 2025, limiting both his batting and bowling. Since the end of the T20 league, Parag hadn’t played any competitive cricket until he turned up to lead East Zone in the Duleep Trophy quarterfinal.""The match felt good. I mean, that was the main goal when I came here to play the game. Performances, I didn't really focus on it that much. I just wanted to have some fun. I haven't played competitive cricket in a long time,"" Parag told reporters after the match, which North Zone won on a first-innings lead to enter the semifinals.""Since the IPL, I haven't really played any cricket. IPL also, I was managing a lot of stress and stuff like that. But this was a good outing. Not in a good way with the amount of overs we fielded.""But then still, rolled my arm for a few overs, batted for a while. I could have converted it for a bigger score, but I'm happy.The arm also feels much better,"" he added.Parag contributed 39 runs off 47 balls and bowled 22 overs, taking a wicket in North Zone’s second innings.His next opportunity will only come in mid-October, either in the Ranji Trophy or if he earns a place in India’s white-ball squad for the tour of Australia.""I think it's back to basics now. I took a break for the shoulder and stuff like that happened. Ranji is coming in, then the Australia tour is coming in (in October). If I get selected there, I do that.""Otherwise, I will go back to domestic cricket and do what I've been doing for the last 2-3 years. Be top scoring every single game, and have a good IPL and play for the country again,"" Parag said.The East Zone skipper admitted he was disappointed with the result.""They played better cricket, I got to give credit to that, the way, I think the first things they were, 230 for 5 and the way Nishant's partnership with their wicket-keeper Kanhaiya and then Auqib, he did a handy hand as well.""So, I feel we could have done better in the first innings while bowling but then we should have got at least close to 350 and then try to restrict them,"" he explained.Reflecting further, he added: ""Once we did not do that (bowling out North quickly in the first innings), they had the lead of around 200 runs and then their batters played really well and just took the game away from us.""",Riyan Parag captained East Zone in the Duleep Trophy quarterfinal.

Poll Should Jasprit Bumrah skip IPL if India is playing a Test series? Yes, it's important for his fitness No, he should participate regardless Only if BCCI compensates him Not sure

Former India bowling coach Bharat Arun feels a bowler like Jasprit Bumrah should skip the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) if India is playing a five-match Test series. At the same time, he says the bowler should be adequately compensated by the BCCI Citing the example of Cricket Australia, Arun noted how they don’t allow premier bowlers Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc to participate in the IPL or other leagues if an Ashes series is scheduled, because Test cricket is their top priority and they need their best cricketers fit and ready to perform.""Definitely, this would help. Especially when you want to preserve bowlers,"" Arun said in conversation with K. Shriniwas Rao, Head of Content (Sports), Times Internet, on the latest episode of Bombay Sport Exchange.""Like, it’s okay for a batter or a spinner to play all formats. But for a fast bowler, yes — playing too much cricket doesn’t give enough time to work on the physical front.""So yes, this definitely can be looked into. People like Bumrah or any other bowler we feel is very important for a particular series can be rested, and they can also be adequately compensated.""If he’s properly compensated and then told by the BCCI, because he’s on contract, that we want you to work on this particular aspect of your game, I think that’s fair enough.""When asked about newer players who have impressed him, Arun said: “Siraj has been there for a while. He has been exceptional.”“He is captain’s delight. Every time you give him the ball, he runs in and gives 100%. That is what I expect from a fast bowler. He’s got fantastic energy.""Looking at this five-Test series, Siraj has maintained the same intensity in the fifth Test as in the first. He needs to be preserved and given sufficient rest before the next series so he can recover fully physically before playing again.”","Former India bowling coach Bharat Arun feels a bowler like Jasprit Bumrah should skip the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) if India is playing a five-match Test series.

Poll Who was the standout player in Sri Lanka's victory against Zimbabwe? Dilshan Madushanka Pathum Nissanka Kamindu Mendis Asitha Fernando

Sri Lanka faced a five percent match fee penalty for maintaining a slow over-rate in their first ODI victory against Zimbabwe in Harare on August 31. The team was found one over short of the target after time allowances, leading to sanctions imposed by ICC Elite Panel Match Referee Jeff Crowe.The penalty was enforced under Article 2.22 of the ICC Code of Conduct, which mandates a five percent match fee fine for each over not bowled in the allotted time. Sri Lankan captain Charith Asalanka accepted the proposed sanction, eliminating the need for a formal hearing.Sri Lanka secured a narrow seven-run victory thanks to Dilshan Madushanka's decisive hat-trick in the final over. The team posted 298/6 in their 50 overs, powered by half-centuries from Pathum Nissanka (76), Janith Liyanage (70 not out), and Kamindu Mendis (57 not out).Zimbabwe's chase began disastrously, losing Brian Bennett and Brendan Taylor for ducks in the first over. However, Ben Curran (70) and captain Sean Williams (57) stabilized the innings with a 118-run partnership.The hosts' hopes were further revived by a 128-run stand between Sikandar Raza (92) and Tony Munyonga (43 not out). With 10 runs needed in the final over, Madushanka's hat-trick sealed Zimbabwe's fate as they finished at 291/8.Madushanka claimed the Player of the Match award for his bowling figures of 4/62, while Asitha Fernando supported well with 3/50.

Barcelona’s perfect start to the La Liga season came to an end on Sunday after a 1-1 draw away to Rayo Vallecano, with the match overshadowed by a malfunction to the video review system.Lamine Yamal gave the champions the lead from the penalty spot in the 40th minute after being tripped by Pep Chavarría. Rayo players and staff furiously contested the call, but with VAR unavailable, the referee’s decision stood. Yamal, who celebrated by pretending to crown himself, later said: “They had fouled me, I felt confident and I always am ready to put the team on my back.”The home side, however, caused Barcelona constant problems with their pace and movement in behind. Goalkeeper Joan García was forced into five major saves, including two one-on-one stops, keeping his side in front until Fran Pérez equalised with a volley from a corner in the 67th minute.Coach Hansi Flick admitted his team struggled to control the contest: “We have to control the ball better. We have to be happy with the point. Joan García played a fantastic match today.”The absence of VAR dominated the post-match discussion. Rayo coach Íñigo Pérez, booked for his heated protests during the first half, later apologised for what he called his “embarrassing behaviour.”He added: “I am a firm defender of the referee’s right to make mistakes. What made me lose my cool was that you can’t start playing with video review and then be told that now you are playing without it.”The result leaves Barcelona on seven points from three games, while Rayo earn their second draw of the campaign.

Poll Do you think Alexander Isak will be a good fit for Liverpool? Yes, definitely! No, not really.

Liverpool are closing in on the signing of Alexander Isak from Newcastle United in a deal set to break the British transfer record, according to multiple reports on Monday.The Premier League champions have agreed a fee of around £130 million ($176m) for the Swedish striker, surpassing the £106m Chelsea paid Benfica for Enzo Fernandez in 2023. The Athletic reported that the 25-year-old will undergo his medical on Monday before sealing a six-year contract at Anfield.Fabrizio Romano broke the news on X, confirming that the deal was agreed for a record £130m transfer fee.Isak enjoyed a prolific season for Newcastle last year, finishing with 23 Premier League goals, which was second only to Mohamed Salah. However, his future became the subject of a drawn-out saga this summer after making clear his desire to move to Merseyside, leading him to train separately from the rest of Eddie Howe’s squad.Newcastle had earlier rejected a £110m bid but were eventually persuaded after signing German forward Nick Woltemade on Saturday for what was also a club-record fee, believed to be up to £69m. Howe hinted last week that the sale of Isak could help ease the club’s Profit and Sustainability Regulations concerns, admitting the financial impact of such a deal could not be ignored.Liverpool’s capture of Isak follows a string of high-profile summer arrivals, including German midfielder Florian Wirtz, French attacker Hugo Ekitike, Dutch defender Jeremie Frimpong and left-back Milos Kerkez.Despite not yet hitting their free-flowing best, the Reds have made a perfect start to their title defence with three wins from three, including Sunday’s 1-0 victory over Arsenal. Newcastle, by contrast, are 17th after a goalless draw with Leeds United.","Liverpool are closing in on the signing of Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak.

Erling Haaland marked his 100th Premier League appearance with a goal, his third of the season, but it wasn’t enough to halt City’s collapse.James Milner equalised for the hosts from the penalty spot in the second half, before 18-year-old Brajan Gruda sealed the win in the 89th minute. Guardiola admitted City struggled in the final half-hour, losing composure and relying on long balls.Haaland had earlier missed two clear chances, including a scuffed effort and a weak header, before finally converting a close-range finish in the 34th minute after a pass from Omar Marmoush.Rodri also squandered a first-half opportunity following a miscued clearance from Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen.In another early fixture, West Ham ended their poor run with a 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest. Jarrod Bowen opened the scoring in the 84th minute, followed by Lucas Paqueta’s penalty in the 88th and a 90th-minute header from Callum Wilson.The win offered relief to manager Graham Potter, who had faced heavy criticism after two consecutive defeats and a League Cup exit.

- 'Hard' for Man Utd 'keepers -

MANCHESTER: Manchester United secured a much-needed first win of the season for under-fire manager Ruben Amorim but needed a 97th minute Bruno Fernandes penalty to beat newly-promoted Burnley 3-2. After exiting the League Cup to fourth-tier Grimsby on Wednesday, the Red Devils twice blew the lead at Old Trafford on Saturday.But they were saved in stoppage time when Fernandes, who missed a penalty in last weekend's 1-1 draw at Fulham, scored from the spot after a VAR review for a pull on Amad Diallo.Victory takes United onto four points from their opening three Premier League games and eases the pressure on Amorim ahead of a two-week international break.""I'm not thinking about turning points,"" said Amorim after securing just his eighth win in 30 Premier League games in charge.""I had this conversation with you guys (the media) like 10 times, so it's day by day...we have a lot to do, but we returned a little bit to our level today.""The 20-time English champions had suffered the latest and biggest embarrassment of Amorim's reign in losing to League Two opposition for the first time in the club's history in midweek.The Portuguese coach cast doubt on his future in the aftermath, saying ""something has to change"" and that he would ""think things through"".Amorim dropped goalkeeper Andre Onana after his role in both Grimsby goals, but his replacement Altay Bayindir endured another difficult afternoon.United have been linked with a move for Antwerp's Senne Lammens as a solution to their goalkeeping issues before Monday's transfer deadline.""It's hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment. But if you look at the first goal, we can defend the better the box,"" added Amorim.""The players are struggling a little bit with all the things around the club, that is normal. So it's not just the goalkeepers, I think everybody has to improve.""United began like a side keen to make amends.Martin Dubravka did well to deny Bryan Mbeumo an early opener before United had a penalty overturned by a VAR review after Mason Mount went down under Kyle Walker's challenge.United's only previous Premier League goal of the season came via the opposition when Fulham's Rodrigo Muniz turned into his own net.Amorim's men needed another own goal to break the deadlock when Casemiro's header came back off the bar and in off the unfortunate Josh Cullen.United should have been further ahead before half-time as Diallo sliced a huge chance wide from Mbeumo's pass.Burnley had barely threatened as an attacking force in the first half but opened up United with ease to level on 55 minutes.Lyle Foster stretched to meet Jacob Bruun Larsen's pinpoint cross.Straight from the kick-off, United retook the lead.Mbeumo's slick movement took him away from his marker to meet Diogo Dalot's cross and net the Frenchman's first Premier League goal since a £65 million move from Brentford.United's frailty from set-pieces and their goalkeeping woes continued as Burnley again came from behind.The Clarets and Foster were denied a second equaliser by the finest of margins for offside against the South African international.Instead, it was Jaidon Anthony who levelled when Bayindir could only parry Loum Tchaouna's effort back into the middle of the goal.Amorim finally introduced £74 million striker Benjamin Sesko for the final 15 minutes in the search for a winner.Twice the giant Slovenian headed chances to make himself a hero off target.Instead Fernandes rode his his side's rescue after a lengthy VAR check on whether Anthony's pull on Diallo continued inside the box.An agonising defeat leaves Burnley with three points from their opening three games.",Manchester United beat Burnley 3-2 in their Premier League clash at Old Trafford.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

McLaren team principal Ian James pens open letter to fans

What’s next in Formula E?

Team Principal Ian James of the departing Formula E team NEOM McLaren has penned an open letter to the fans of the team, marking their departure from the electric motorsport format. Addressing the Papaya Army, James thanked them for their trust and support as the team went on to win two Drivers’ World Championships and two Teams’ World Championships over 103 races in seven seasons.Ian James began the letter saying that he wrote it with “a huge amount of pride, as well as with more than a hint of sadness,” as the team closed the final chapter after seven years of competing in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship.Thanking the fans for their love on social media and at the track, he said, “The team was always blown away by the amount of papaya we saw at circuits across the world, race-in, race-out, right from our very first round as the NEOM McLaren Formula E team.

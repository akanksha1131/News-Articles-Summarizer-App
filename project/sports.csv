Pakistan coach fires warning ahead of Asia Cup final

Rashid Latif tweet

During Pakistan ’s nervy Super Four match against Bangladesh on Thursday evening, former captain Rashid Latif sparked chatter on social media with a pointed post.He tweeted a photo of Mushtaq Ahmed — currently Pakistan’s spin coach at the High Performance Centre in Lahore and also serving as Bangladesh’s spin bowling coach — smiling while the scoreboard in the background showed Bangladesh struggling at 51 for 5. Latif’s caption highlighted Mushtaq’s dual roles and described him as a “great bowler.”The timing of the post did not go unnoticed. Pakistan were still in a fight to defend 135, with the game delicately poised. In the end, Shaheen Afridi and Haris Rauf delivered under pressure, taking three wickets each as Bangladesh were restricted to 124 for 9, handing Pakistan an 11-run win. Mohammad Haris earlier top-scored with 31 in Pakistan’s total of 135 for 8.On Friday, India extended their unbeaten run to six games after edging Sri Lanka in a dramatic Super Over finish, even though the result was a dead rubber with their place in the final already confirmed. Pathum Nissanka’s blistering century nearly handed Sri Lanka an upset, but Arshdeep Singh bowled a brilliant Super Over to give India the win after both sides finished level on 202. Abhishek Sharma once again stood out with a 31-ball 61, while Sanju Samson and Tilak Varma played crucial supporting roles in the batting effort.The victory ensured Pakistan will face India in Sunday’s Asia Cup final in Dubai. It will be the third meeting between the two sides in this tournament, after India won both the group stage and Super Four encounters. Those matches were clouded by controversy, including the absence of post-match handshakes.","Pakistan coach fires warning ahead of Asia Cup final against India.

Bayern Munich's Harry Kane achieved a remarkable milestone by scoring his 99th and 100th goals for the club in just 104 games during their 4-0 victory against Werder Bremen on Friday, reaching the century mark faster than football stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Erling Haaland did for their respective clubs.Kane's achievement came one game sooner than both Ronaldo, who needed 105 games to reach 100 goals for Real Madrid in 2011, and Haaland, who also took 105 games to hit the century mark for Manchester City last year.""It's crazy even for me, to be honest. Obviously it's an honor to reach 100 goals for this great club. A big thanks to all the staff, the players, everyone who helped me get to where I am. But 100 goals, to do it that quickly, is something I'm really proud of. But as I always say, it's on to the next one now and hopefully I can reach another hundred as soon as possible,"" Kane told broadcaster Sky.The match began with Jonathan Tah's backheel giving Bayern the lead, followed by Kane's first goal from a penalty in the 45th minute after being fouled by Marco Friedl. His landmark 100th goal came in the 65th minute from Luis Díaz's assist, making it 3-0.Kane's form has been exceptional this season, scoring 15 goals in eight games for Bayern in 2025-26, plus one goal for England against Serbia.He was substituted for Nicolas Jackson in the 78th minute, missing the chance for his third hat trick of the season. Konrad Laimer completed the scoring with Bayern's fourth goal in the 87th minute.""I honestly have to say that isn't a topic for us. We don't discuss that, we don't need to discuss that,"" coach Vincent Kompany told Sky when asked about Kane's potential return to the Premier League next year. ""What he's showing now is how he feels, I believe, and that was another nice moment for him today.""The victory strengthened Bayern's position at the top of the Bundesliga with their fifth consecutive win. They now prepare for their Champions League match against Pafos in Cyprus on Tuesday.Bremen currently sits in 14th place in the 18-team league and risks dropping into the relegation zone depending on weekend results.The match featured Bayern wearing a special grey and green Oktoberfest commemorative shirt, which prompted protests from fans.

Australian women's cricket team captain Alyssa Healy has made an appeal to Indian fans ahead of the 2025 ODI World Cup. She encouraged them to attend matches wearing Chennai Super Kings jerseys featuring MS Dhoni 's name.Healy suggested that since both Australian and CSK jerseys share the same yellow colour, it would create a nice atmosphere in the stadiums.The tournament schedule reveals that Australia's group stage matches will not be played in Chennai.The team will play three matches in Indore, two in Vizag, and two in Colombo, Sri Lanka. However, MS Dhoni's popularity extends beyond Chennai, with fans across India supporting CSK in various cities during IPL matches.""I'd really like to encourage the Indian fans to show up in their Chennai MS Dhoni shirts because they're yellow,"" Healy said at the captain's day press meet. ""That would be great. Yeah, so show up in that, have some yellow in the crowd, that would be nice.""Australia enter the tournament as favourites, having won seven World Cup titles and possessing one of the strongest squads globally, even for Indian conditions.""I don't think it gets any easier,"" Australian pacer Mitchell Starc's wife added.""I feel like you have labelled us favourites, so thanks for that. But I don't necessarily think that's the case. I think India in their home conditions are going to be really, really tough to beat, along with a couple of captains sitting alongside. So it doesn't get any easier. I think this ODI World Cup is going to be one of the strongest ones that I have been a part of.""Healy emphasised that her team remains focused and determined to perform well in the tournament.""I don't think it's quite in the Australian culture to get too complacent about things at any point in time. People tend to write more about us when we lose than when we actually win, so it's quite a nice thing to experience. I feel like I'm part of a really special group at the moment that wants to be better every single day. That mindset is already in place, it just allows them to go out there and enjoy their cricket on the field. That's basically as simple as it gets.

Poll Who was the standout player in the Asia Cup match between India and Sri Lanka? Pathum Nissanka Sanju Samson Abhishek Sharma

: It took a Super Over to produce the result of the most inconsequential match of the Asia Cup Pathum Nissanka ’s (107 off 58 balls; 7x4, 6x6) maiden T20I ton went in vain as India held their nerve to keep their winning streak alive in the tournament.Even in the Super Over, there was drama.On the fourth ball of the Super Over, Dasun Shanaka missed a wild hoick and an alert Sanju Samson hit the stumps with a direct hit from an under-arm flick. It was a yorker-length ball, Shanaka moved away, tried to dig it out, but missed. The ball went past the edge with no bat involved. For some reason, Shanaka was off for a run, but Samson hit the bullseye. Since it had already been given out caught behind and reviewed, the ball was declared dead, and umpire Gazi Sohel made his point clear to India that the first decision would stand. Because the bowler’s-end umpire had signaled out, the ball was dead—allowing Shanaka to escape the run-out.However, it cost India little, as Arshdeep Singh dismissed Shanaka with the very next ball and India sealed the match.Chasing 203, Nissanka came down on the Indian bowlers like a ton of bricks and smashed the first century of the Asia Cup off just 52 balls. The Sri Lankan opener attacked from ball one and spared none.He teed off with a boundary off the first delivery, but lost opening partner Kusal Mendis in the very first over.Hardik Pandya struck early, removing Mendis for a duck, but Nissanka and Kusal Perera counterattacked brilliantly. The pair tore into both seamers and spinners, adding 127 runs for the second wicket.Nissanka was the star, blasting 7 fours and 6 sixes en route to his maiden T20I century. Perera too looked fluent, scoring 58 off 32 balls, before Varun Chakravarthy broke the stand by dismissing the left-hander in the 13th over.Charith Asalanka (5) and Kamindu Mendis (3) failed to capitalise on the platform, while skipper Shanaka chipped in with a brisk 22 not out off 11 balls. Nissanka’s fine knock ended on 107 in the final over, courtesy of Harshit Rana.The match went down to the wire. With Sri Lanka needing three runs off the last delivery, Shanaka heaved it to the leg side. A misfield in the deep, followed by a fumble from Rana while collecting, left the door open for a third run. But Shanaka and Janith Liyanage chose to settle for two, dragging the contest into a Super Over.Earlier, Abhishek Sharma’s 31-ball 61 and Sanju Samson’s fluent 39 helped India post an imposing 202 for 5 against Sri Lanka in their final Super 4s clash at the Dubai International Stadium on Friday.It was the highest total of the tournament so far, eclipsing India’s 188 against Oman and Afghanistan’s identical tally versus Hong Kong.Abhishek set the tone with a 31-ball 61, his third straight half-century, while Samson finally found his rhythm at No. 5, smashing three sixes in a 22-ball cameo. Tilak Varma anchored the innings superbly, finishing unbeaten on 49 off 34 balls—a knock that will give him plenty of confidence.Abhishek’s dominance in the powerplay has become a hallmark of this tournament. His innings, peppered with eight fours and two sixes, once again threatened to turn into a century before he was caught at deep mid-wicket off a Charith Asalanka half-tracker.Earlier, Shubman Gill (4) perished when a Maheesh Theekshana delivery stopped on him, the leading edge comfortably pouched by the bowler. Skipper Suryakumar Yadav’s (12) lean patch continued, trapped leg-before by Wanindu Hasaranga while attempting a sweep.Samson’s arrival changed the tempo. Batting with intent, he looked in ominous touch for the first time in the tournament. His standout strike was a towering hit straight down the ground off Hasaranga, muscled into the sight-screen after he shuffled across to create room. Soon after, he dispatched Shanaka over cow corner for another maximum.Samson and Tilak added 66 runs in just 6.5 overs to set the stage for a late flourish, which Axar Patel capped with a last-over six to push India beyond 200.India will take on Pakistan in the summit clash on Sunday.",Pathum Nissanka hits maiden T20I century but India win by one wicket.

But Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Perera steadied the innings with a second-wicket stand of 127 runs. Perera fell for 58 off 32 balls to Varun Chakaravarthy, but the chase stayed alive with Nissanka holding one end.With his incredible innings of 107 runs in 58 balls, Nissanka registered his fifth half-century in the Asia Cup T20 format.In doing so, he surpassed Virat Kohli’s tally of four fifties, becoming the player with the most 50-plus scores in the tournament’s history. Kohli had set his mark in just nine innings, but Nissanka has now gone one clear with five from 12 innings.He also snatched another record from Kohli and KL Rahul, becoming the owner of the biggest partnership for any wicket thanks to the 127-run partnership between Nissanka and Kusal Parera. This bettered the 119 runs added by Kohli and KL Rahul against Afghanistan in 2022.Moreover, the century by Nissanka is also the highest score by a Sri Lankan against India in T20Is. He breached the 100-run mark against India in just 52 balls.

Their final score of 202 for 5 became the highest team total in the Asia Cup 2025 so far, surpassing Afghanistan’s 188/6 against Hong Kong and India’s own 188/8 against Oman earlier in the tournament.This makes India the first side to cross the 200-run mark in this edition of the tournament.It is also only the second time in Asia Cup T20I history that a total of more than 200 has been recorded, with India also holding the overall record of 212/2 against Afghanistan in 2022.The achievement put on display the depth in India’s batting. Abhishek’s fearless approach at the top, added with Tilak’s steady hand through the middle, showcased the balance the team currently has.India also owns the record the highest-ever score in the Asia Cup in the T20 format, which came when they scored 212/2 against Afghanistan in 2022, where they won by 101 runs.For Sri Lanka, who came into the contest already eliminated from the race to the final, the challenge of chasing down a record total only added to what has been a difficult campaign.India’s innings not only secured them momentum heading into the title decider, but also placed their name once again in the record books of Asia Cup T20Is.","India's score of 202 against Sri Lanka on Friday meant that they became the first to achieve a unique record in this Asia Cup.

India batter Abhishek Sharma has etched his name in history by becoming the highest run-scorer in a single T20 Asia Cup edition.The dynamic left-hander overtook Pakistan’s Mohammad Rizwan and India’s Virat Kohli , both of whom previously dominated this record.With his fluent knock of 61 off just 31 balls against Sri Lanka in the final Super Fours fixture in Dubai, Abhishek moved past Rizwan’s tally of 281 from 2022 and Kohli’s 276 in the same year.He now stands unbeaten on 309 runs from six innings, underlining his consistency and explosive impact at the top of the order.Abhishek’s strike rate has been equally remarkable, making him a vital cog in India’s Asia Cup campaign.His aggressive start against Sri Lanka once again laid a strong foundation, even though he fell at 92/3 after being dismissed by skipper Charith Asalanka.The contest itself is a dead rubber, with India and Pakistan already through to Sunday’s final.However, it remains crucial for India to iron out flaws, particularly their fielding lapses, after dropping 12 catches in the tournament.For Sri Lanka, the fixture offers a chance to salvage pride following back-to-back defeats that ended their campaign.At the toss, Sri Lanka’s Charith Asalanka opted to bowl first, hoping to restrict India to around 170.

The Asia Cup Super Fours fixture between India and Sri Lanka in Dubai saw an early moment of brilliance that left fans and players alike stunned. As India’s Shubman Gill walked to the crease, Sri Lanka’s spinner Maheesh Theekshana produced a spectacular caught-and-bowled dismissal.Theekshana delivered a fullish ball that wasn’t quite in the driving zone.Gill went for a confident drive and made solid contact, but the ball headed toward Theekshana, who reacted instantly. The spinner dived across and clutched the ball with both hands, leaving Gill frozen in disbelief before he began his walk back.The dismissal, which means Gill could amass only four runs off three balls, showcased exceptional reflexes and timing from the Sri Lankan bowler.Sri Lanka captain Charith Asalanka had won the toss and opted to field first against India.Speaking at the toss, Asalanka said, ""We are going to bowl first. We know that we can't qualify for the final, but it is still an important game for us. It is a good pitch, and we want to restrict them to 170-175. They have been doing really well, especially our openers. We have one change - Janith Liyange comes in for Chamika Karunaratne.""India, having already secured a place in the Asia Cup final against Pakistan on Sunday, looked to maintain their momentum.Skipper Suryakumar Yadav remarked, ""Just continue doing what we have been doing. We were actually looking to bat first. Good atmosphere, good game, and we are looking forward to it. It is part of the game (dropped catches).

Aston Villa secured their first win of the season with a 1-0 victory over Bologna in their Europa League opener, while Rangers suffered a 1-0 home defeat to Genk on Thursday, intensifying pressure on their manager Russell Martin. The matches marked the beginning of the Europa League campaign for both teams.Villa, despite being pre-tournament favorites and reaching the Champions League quarter-finals last season, had struggled with their form, failing to win any of their first five Premier League games. The victory came amid internal tensions, with manager Unai Emery recently criticizing his players and sporting director Monchi departing the club.John McGinn's strike in the 13th minute proved decisive for Villa. The Scotland international found the bottom corner with a shot from the edge of the area.Ollie Watkins, who started on the bench due to his goalless run this season, missed a penalty in the second half with Łukasz Skorupski making an easy save.Bologna came close to equalizing when Santiago Castro's header hit the crossbar, but Villa managed to hold on for the win, repeating their success against the Italian side from their previous Champions League encounter.""Important to get a win at home after not our strongest start to the season,"" McGinn said.

Barcelona secured a 3-1 comeback victory against Real Oviedo in La Liga on Thursday, with Robert Lewandowski and Ronald Araujo scoring headers after Eric Garcia's equalizer cancelled out Alberto Reina's opening goal. The win keeps Barcelona two points behind league leaders Real Madrid.Barcelona fell behind in the 33rd minute when goalkeeper Joan Garcia's error allowed Reina to score from 40 yards out into an empty net. The Catalans equalized through Eric Garcia early in the second half.Substitute Lewandowski put Barcelona ahead with a header that went in off the crossbar from Frenkie de Jong's cross. Araujo sealed the victory in the 88th minute by heading in Marcus Rashford's corner.""In the second half, I said to my team, we have to continue, we have to play with calmness, to be convinced about playing with the ball, and we did it well,"" said Barcelona coach Hansi Flick.The victory marked Barcelona's fourth consecutive win across all competitions, achieved without injured star winger Lamine Yamal.Oviedo, playing in Spain's top flight for the first time since 2000/01, featured 40-year-old midfielder Santi Cazorla making his first start of the season.Rashford, who started on the left wing after being benched last weekend for tardiness to a team meeting, created several chances. Oviedo goalkeeper Aaron Escandell made multiple saves from his attempts.""I saw the goalkeeper's mistake and I went first time, and in the moment I kicked it, I saw it was good,"" Oviedo midfielder Reina told DAZN. ""My first in the top flight, I'll never forget it.""Flick defended his goalkeeper's mistake: ""It's the style that we want him to play in, and it can happen. He's a fantastic goalkeeper... one mistake and they use it, but it's football.""De Jong's introduction at halftime helped Barcelona increase their tempo. Escandell continued making saves from Raphinha and Torres before Lewandowski's breakthrough.""The changes were at the right time, with Frenkie and also with Lewy,"" said Flick.Lewandowski, who has mainly been used as a substitute this season following an early injury, showed patience: ""I'm patient, I'm not in a hurry, the season is long and we have a lot of games.""Despite the loss, Oviedo's goalscorer remained positive: ""All footballers dream of nights like this, to play against these players and with these fans.

Indian Women's League: Women-heavy coaching team for Sethu FC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/indian-womens-league-women-heavy-coaching-team-for-sethu-fc/articleshow/124130026.cms,"Rutuja Gunwant

CHENNAI: Indian Women’s League (IWL) club Sethu FC have appointed women in positions of power for the upcoming season. While Rutuja Gunwant has been roped in as the head coach, Kulsum Bi Shaikh and Surbhi Manjrekar have been anointed the head of women’s football and assistant coach respectively.The 2025-26 IWL is expected to begin in the first week of November and end in April, with the top-tier league taking a big break for the AFC Women’s Asian Cup – where the India senior team will compete – in Australia in March.Rutuja will fill the seat vacated by Arun Kumar, who had replaced Shareef Khan midway through the previous season. Rutuja had represented Sethu as a player in the club’s formative years and most recently served as a coach for the Gokulam Kerala FC women’s team. As for Kulsum, she was associated with Odisha FC in the last IWL season.“We felt that it would be better to hand over the coaching duties to a known face. We wanted to have people who are familiar with the system (Indian women’s football). I personally felt that women coaches would be able to handle our players in a better way. That is why we have gone with a women-heavy coaching and staff contingent this time,” Seeni Mohaideen, founder and owner of the Tamil Nadu-based club, told TOI on Thursday.Having finished a disappointing fifth in the previous IWL campaign, Sethu, champions of the 2018-19 season, are determined to once again battle for top honours. In the close season, they have shown ambition, securing the services of forward Lynda Kom and midfielder Grace Lalrampari by paying transfer fee to the now-relegated Odisha.Sethu have retained approximately 14 domestic players and are likely to sign two foreign outfield members – from Africa – and an overseas goalkeeper. “We have players who are part of the India team. We also have young talent in the squad, so it should be a good mix. Our ultimate goal is to get to the AFC Women’s Champions League (the IWL winners will have an opportunity to qualify for the tournament),” Seeni added.Seeni also stressed that the IWL clubs are finding it increasingly difficult to plan for the season ahead, due to lack of clarity regarding the schedule. “The fixtures are yet to be finalised by the AIFF, so we do not know when we will play our home matches. We need to book the stadium soon,” said Seeni while confirming that Chennai’s Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium will remain the club’s home venue.Sethu FC staff: Rutuja Gunwant (head coach), Kulsum Bi Shaikh (head of women’s football), Surbhi Manjrekar (assistant coach), Aadil Ansari (goalkeeping coach), John Mark Danny (strength and conditioning coach), Akshayaa (physiotherapist), Parthiban (head of operations).",Sethu FC appoint women in positions of power for the upcoming season.

(AP Photo/Jose Breton)

Antony's late goal denied Nottingham Forest a winning return to European football as Real Betis grabbed a 2-2 draw in their Europa League opener on Wednesday, while Roma won at Nice.Forest, managed by Ange Postecoglou who won the tournament with Tottenham last season, are playing in Europe for the first time in 30 years.They are only in the Europa League rather than the Conference League because English FA Cup winners Crystal Palace fell foul of UEFA 's rules governing multi-club ownership.Last season's Conference League runners-up Betis struck first in the 15th minute when Antony's pass picked out Cedric Bakambu inside the area, before the veteran striker turned and fired the ball into the roof of the net.But Forest levelled three minutes later as a sweeping move finished with Morgan Gibbs-White's low ball across the face of goal being tapped in from close range by Igor Jesus.Brazilian Igor Jesus, who scored his first goals for Forest since his summer move from Botafogo against Swansea last week, completed the turnaround midway through the first half with a clinical header from Douglas Luiz's corner.Postecoglou's men threatened to seize complete control before half-time, as Igor Jesus twice went close to a hat-trick and Callum Hudson-Odoi hit a shot against the post.Betis managed to stay in the game, though, and a period of late pressure paid dividends when Antony slotted in Marc Roca's ball at the back post with five minutes remaining.""I think first I should be proud of the players' efforts. It's a difficult place to come, difficult conditions,"" Postecoglou, still waiting for his first win in charge since replacing the sacked Nuno Espirito Santo, told TNT Sports.""The thing I could fault is we didn't put the game to bed.""Roma got their campaign for a first Europa League title under way with an impressive 2-1 victory at Nice.Gian Piero Gasperini's men, who have reached at least the semi-finals in three of the previous five seasons, secured a winning start thanks to two goals in the space of three second-half minutes from Evan Ndicka and Gianluca Mancini.Terem Moffi pulled one back for Nice from the penalty spot with 13 minutes to play, but Roma held on.Local authorities and prosecutors said 102 people identified as Roma ultras, many of whom caught with potential weapons, were arrested in the build-up to the game for intending to commit violence.Celtic, playing in the competition for the first time since 2021 after an embarrassing loss to Kairat Almaty in Champions League qualifying, were held to a 1-1 draw by fellow former European champions Red Star Belgrade in Serbia.A long spell of Celtic pressure at the start of the first half culminated in Kelechi Iheanacho's second goal since signing on a free transfer from Sevilla earlier this month.Red Star hit back, though, in the 65th minute as Marko Arnautovic turned in Franklin Tebo Uchenna's cross.Elsewhere, Dinamo Zagreb beat Fenerbahce 3-1 in the Croatian capital, while Bundesliga side Freiburg clinched a 2-1 home win over Basel.",Nottingham Forest held 2-2 by Real Betis in Europa League opener.

Chelsea survive

Alexander Isak scored his first Liverpool goal to inspire a 2-1 win against Southampton in the League Cup third round, while Chelsea survived a scare to beat third-tier Lincoln on Tuesday.Isak was making his third appearance for Liverpool since his British record £125 million ($169 million) move from Newcastle on transfer deadline day.The 26-year-old had drawn a blank in his 58-minute debut appearance against Atletico Madrid and also failed to net after coming off the bench for the last 23 minutes of Saturday's Merseyside derby win over Everton.But Isak got off the mark in the 43nd minute as Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy tried a short pass that was intercepted by Federico Chiesa, who picked out the Sweden striker to fire home.It was a belated birthday present for Isak, who turned 26 on Sunday.Isak, who had scored for Newcastle in their League Cup final win against Liverpool last season, was taken off at half-time as he builds up his fitness after missing pre-season training while his transfer was being negotiated.Shea Charles equalised for the Championship side in the 76th minute with a close-range finish after a wayward header from Liverpool's Wataru Endo.Arne Slot had made 11 changes from the Everton game but substitute Hugo Ekitike saved Liverpool's understudies from a penalty shoot-out when he finished off Chiesa's pass in the 85th minute.The French striker took off his shirt to celebrate and was dismissed for a second bookable offence.Liverpool have made a perfect start to the season, with seven successive wins, including five in the Premier League to take them to the top of the table and one in the Champions League against Atletico.""Not our best performance.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

Croatian tennis legend Nikola Pilic, the pioneering coach who trained Novak Djokovic and the only captain to lead three countries to Davis Cup glory, has died at the age of 86, the Croatian Tennis Association announced on Tuesday. Pilic passed away on Monday in the western Croatian town of Opatija.Born in Split in 1939, Pilic began representing the Yugoslav youth national team just four years after starting tennis. He went on to dominate national competitions, winning five Yugoslav singles titles, seven doubles crowns, and one mixed doubles championship. His greatest achievement on the court came in 1973 when he finished runner-up at the French Open to Ilie Nastase. He also claimed the US Open doubles title in 1970 alongside Pierre Barthes.Pilic was already a prominent figure when tennis turned professional in 1968, becoming one of the first eight men, dubbed the “Handsome Eight,” to sign with Lamar Hunt’s World Championship Tennis tour.

Taylor Fritz held off Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to seal Team World's triumph in the Laver Cup on Sunday as two wins for Carlos Alcaraz on the final day proved too little for Team Europe.Fritz fired a backhand volley winner on his first match point to give Team World a 15-9 victory over Europe in the global tennis event, sparking jubilant celebrations from his teammates and World captain Andre Agassi at Chase Center -- home of the NBA's Golden State Warriors.""The energy from the team, it just feels the moments of winning feel so much better, the moments of losing feel so much worse because you're doing it for all these guys,"" Fritz said.""It just fires me up so much,"" added the fifth-ranked American, who had beaten Alcaraz on Saturday when Team World swept all four matches to seize a 9-3 lead.Fritz had raced through the opening set against a weary-looking Zverev.The German stepped it up in the second set, but he was down a break and trailing 4-3 before he finally mustered his first break points of the night.He converted his third to level the set at 4-4 to the delight of his Europe teammates and captain Yannick Noah.A quick hold from Zverev left Fritz serving to stay in the set.He held to love and they battled to the tiebreaker, where Fritz took a 3-0 lead only for Zverev to win three straight points before Fritz won four of the final five.Alcaraz, fresh off his sixth Grand Slam title at the US Open, had kept Europe's title defense alive with a blistering 6-2, 6-1 victory over Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo.Alcaraz and Casper Ruud had sliced Europe's deficit with a 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 doubles victory over Reilly Opelka and Alex Michelsen to open Sunday's action.But Australian world number eight Alex De Minaur then beat Czech Jakub Mensik 6-3, 6-4 to push Team World's lead to 12-6, with 13 points needed to claim the Cup and each match on Sunday worth three points.De Minaur, a late replacement on Team World for Frances Tiafoe, had nabbed two wins on Saturday -- beating Zverev in singles and coming through again in doubles.Team World regained the title they surrendered to Europe last year in Berlin.Europe have won five of eight editions of the event co-created by Swiss great Roger Federer , which will be held in London next year.Ruud def.

SHENZHEN: Jasmine Paolini beat Jessica Pegula on the fourth match point as defending champion Italy won the Billie Jean King Cup with a comprehensive victory over the United States on Sunday.Italy won both singles ties in straight sets, meaning there was no need for a decisive doubles match. The No. 8-ranked Paolini beat seventh-ranked Pegula 6-4, 6-2 after No. 91 Elisabetta Cocciaretto won 6-4, 6-4 against Emma Navarro, breaking her serve three times.Paolini broke Pegula's serve with a two-hand backhand down the line to take the first set and move Italy closer to success at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Center Arena in China.But with Paolini serving for the match at 5-1 she wavered a little. Pegula saved three match points and then two unforced errors from Paolini allowed Pegula to break back to 5-2 down.A strong looping forehand gave Paolini - the runner-up at the French Open and Wimbledon last year - a fourth match point and she took it, clinching victory when Pegula's two-handed backhand clipped the net and landed wide.Paolini raised her arms in the air, then walked over to hug her teammates.All the staff members joined them on the court as they danced in a circle before celebrating with blue-shirted, flag-waving Italy fans.Pegula and Navarro each came from a set down to defeat Britain and reach the final.But not this time.Italy boasted a doubles pairing of Olympic champions Paolini and Sara Errani, who also won the French Open doubles together this year. They would have faced Pegula and top-ranked doubles player Taylor Townsend in what might have been an exciting trophy decider.The BJK Cup was formerly known as the Fed Cup, and the United States is the most successful team as an 18-time winner, but not since 2017.Italy was contesting its third straight final and clinched its sixth title.

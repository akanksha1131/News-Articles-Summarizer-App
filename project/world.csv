In response to the White House proclamation on H-1B visas, major US firms including Amazon , Meta, Microsoft, and JPMorgan have issued urgent advisories asking employees on H-1B visas to return to the US before the Sept 21 deadline.Microsoft’s advisory, shared shortly after the proclamation, warned of the risk of being denied re-entry into the US if employees travel abroad. “While the proclamation does not reference H-4 dependents, we also recommend that H-4s remain in the US,” the company said. The note also added that while “there is other content about the pause in processing H-1B petitions for individuals who are outside the US,” the company does not interpret this to immediately affect extensions of H-1B status or changes of status for those already in the country.The company urged overseas staff to make immediate travel arrangements to return before the deadline. “This guidance is being positioned as a precaution to avoid disruptions to personal and professional plans,” the note said. Emails to Microsoft and JPMorgan went unanswered till going to press.Fidelity Investments and State Street reportedly sent similar advisories, though TOI could not independently verify them. According to Reuters, Amazon has asked its employees to stay within US borders until there is more clarity. JPMorgan, through its law firm Ogletree Deakins, told staff: “H-1B visa holders who are currently in the US should remain in the US and avoid international travel until the govt issues clear travel guidance. ”","Major US firms including Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and JPMorgan have issued urgent advisories asking employees on H-1B visas to return to the US before the Sept 21 deadline.

"'Border czar' in trouble? Tom Homan secretly probed for 'bribery' in 2024, report says; case closed under Trump",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-border-czar-in-trouble-tom-homan-probed-by-fbi-for-bribery-in-2024-report-says-case-closed-under-trump/articleshow/124021137.cms,"Tom Homan (File photo)





Tom Homan, US president Donald Trump’s close aide and his “border czar,” was the target of an FBI undercover operation last year, according to a report.As per MSNBC's exclusive report, Homan accepted $50,000 in cash after suggesting to undercover agents — who posed as business executives — he could help them secure government contracts in a second Trump administration.The probe began in Texas the summer of 2024, after a subject in a separate investigation claimed Homan was soliciting payments in exchange for awarding contracts should Trump win the presidential election. At the time, he was the president and owner of a private consulting business that offered to help companies in the border security sector secure government contracts.The FBI and Justice Department held off to see whether he would follow through if formally empowered under Trump.On November 11, 2024, six days after the presidential election that he won, the Republican named Homan as his “border czar.” Because the role is adversarial in nature, it did not require Senate confirmation or a full FBI background check.The matter stalled in January - shortly after Trump began his second and final term - despite investigators believing they had a strong criminal case. In recent weeks, the probe was officially closed after FBI director Kash Patel called for a status update.In a joint statement to the outlet, Patel and deputy attorney general Todd Blanche gave the following explanation:""The case originated under the previous Joe Biden administration. It was subjected to a full review by FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors. They found no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing. The department’s resources must remain focused on real threats to the American people, not baseless investigations. As a result, the investigation has been closed.""The White House criticised the probe as ""blatantly political"" and one that found no evidence of illegal activity.""Tom Homan has not been involved with any contract award decisions. He is a career law enforcement officer and lifelong public servant who is doing a phenomenal job on behalf of President Trump and the country,"" White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson said.In Trump's first term, Homan, 63, briefly served as the interim head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).","Tom Homan, US president Donald Trump’s close aide and his “border czar,’ was the target of an FBI undercover operation last year, according to a report.

Who is Mary Cleary?





A conservative lawyer who has denied allegations she took part in the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot has been appointed acting US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, following the ouster of the office’s chief on Friday.Mary “Maggie” Cleary informed staff of her appointment in an email on Saturday, writing, “While this appointment was unexpected, I am humbled to be joining your ranks,” according to the Associated Press.Cleary takes over from Erik Siebert, who was forced out amid a Trump administration push to bring criminal charges against New York attorney general Letitia James over alleged mortgage fraud. Trump later insisted he had fired Siebert, rejecting the latter's claims of a resignation.The investigation into James, a long-time Trump adversary, centers on paperwork discrepancies tied to her Brooklyn townhouse and a Virginia property. The Justice Department has yet to bring charges, and her attorneys have dismissed the inquiry as politically motivated retaliation.Cleary returned to the Justice Department recently as senior counsel in the criminal division after serving as a prosecutor in the Culpeper Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office.She also worked as deputy secretary of public safety under Virginia's Republican governor Glenn Youngkin and later in the office of the state's attorney general, Jason Miyares.Earlier this year, Cleary wrote in The Spectator World that she had been “wrongly identified” in a photo as being on Capitol grounds during the January 6 riot, while she was a federal prosecutor in Virginia. “Everyone knew I was a conservative. It was all over my resume. I was in leadership in my local Republican Committee. But I had not gone to the Capitol that day,” she wrote.She described being placed on administrative leave and questioned by agents before later being cleared to return to work. “In the last four years, I’ve been somewhat cautious about sharing my experience, but now, while Donald Trump is president, I feel emboldened to finally tell how I, too, was targeted politically,” Cleary added.","Mary ""Maggie"" Cleary appointed acting US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.

Billionaire Richard Branson ignored on NYC streets while promoting ‘Doorbell of Dreams’



New Yorkers too busy to notice Richard Branson with a mic



Billionaire’s rejections spark laughter and praise online

British billionaire Richard Branson, best known as the adventurous founder of the Virgin Group, recently experienced an unusual moment on the bustling streets of New York City. While promoting his latest initiative, Doorbell of Dreams, the 75-year-old tycoon tried stopping passersby for quick interviews, only to be repeatedly ignored. Despite his global fame and media presence, New Yorkers brushed past him as though he were just another man with a microphone or a street performer. The incident, filmed by entrepreneur Simon Squibb, quickly went viral on Instagram, sparking amusement, admiration, and lighthearted commentary online. What began as a fun campaign to encourage everyday dreamers to pitch their business ideas turned into an unexpected lesson in humility, showing that even billionaires are not immune to everyday rejection, unpredictability, public scrutiny, or the realities of life outside celebrity circles.During a lighthearted promotional event, Branson attempted to stop pedestrians for quick interviews. Despite his global reputation, most passersby ignored him, hurrying along as though he were just another stranger with a microphone.The unusual moment, filmed by entrepreneur Simon Squibb, quickly gained traction on Instagram, showing the tycoon facing rejection after rejection.This unexpected moment wasn’t just a publicity stunt; it was part of a campaign to promote “Doorbell of Dreams.” The initiative, launched by Branson in partnership with Squibb’s startup HelpBnk, invites everyday dreamers to pitch their business ideas in under 60 seconds.What makes the concept unique is its accessibility. Through a specially designed video doorbell, aspiring entrepreneurs can present their ideas, with the hope of receiving mentorship, guidance, or even investment. Originally launched in the UK, the project recently expanded to New York, where Virgin Hotels partnered as a venue for participants. The street interviews were meant to spark curiosity among locals and draw attention to the campaign.The video shows Branson politely approaching strangers with the question, “Can I ask you a question?” But instead of engaging, people brushed him off. One woman walked by without so much as a glance, while another looked briefly at him before rushing away, clearly preoccupied with her own thoughts and errands.For a man who has conquered industries from airlines to space travel, being ignored on the sidewalk was a rare and humbling experience. Squibb, amused by the scene, remarked, “A bit of rejection is healthy.” Branson laughed at himself and replied, “I’m not doing too well, am I?” Eventually, a passerby did agree to share his dream, stating his goal was to achieve financial independence, help others, and contribute positively to the world in meaningful ways.Once uploaded, the clip drew widespread attention on social media. Many users were stunned that a man of Branson’s stature could blend so seamlessly into the crowd. One viewer commented, “Richard Branson getting rejected? Unbelievable!” Another wrote, “Imagine ignoring one of the world’s most inspirational entrepreneurs who’s just asking you a simple question.”The rejections, however, were not seen as embarrassing but rather refreshing. Viewers praised Branson’s good-natured attitude and willingness to step into unfamiliar situations despite his status. A popular comment read, “This is what humility looks like. Sir Richard Branson has every reason to stay in his comfort zone, but he still pushes himself.”","Billionaire Richard Branson ignored on NYC streets while promoting ‘Doorbell of Dreams’ While promoting his latest initiative, the 75-year-old tycoon tried stopping passersby for quick interviews.

"UAE cuts interest rates after US Fed’s decision: What it means for your loans, savings, and investments",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-cuts-interest-rates-after-us-feds-decision-what-it-means-for-your-loans-savings-and-investments/articleshow/123965156.cms,"The UAE lowered its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.15%, following the US Federal Reserve’s recent cut

UAE mirrors US Fed's rate cut

Impact on borrowing costs, sectoral outlook

Real Estate: Falling mortgage rates may reignite demand in Dubai’s property market, especially among first-time buyers and investors seeking leveraged exposure.



Retail and Tourism: Lower interest rates can boost disposable income and spur consumer demand, supporting domestic consumption and inbound travel.



SMEs and Corporates: Easier access to cheaper financing may encourage business expansion, especially for small and medium enterprises and capital-intensive industries.





Why the UAE Dirham is pegged to USD





What is a currency peg?





Reduced exchange rate risk in trade and investment



Greater price stability in imported goods



Enhanced investor confidence due to currency predictability





Behind the Fed's move

Slowing job gains



A slight uptick in the unemployment rate, although it remains relatively low



Moderated economic growth in the first half of 2025



Elevated inflation, particularly in core categories









In a significant shift aligned with the US Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy easing, the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has reduced its base interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.15%, effective September 18, 2025. The rate cut marks the UAE’s response to changing global economic signals and is expected to lower borrowing costs, potentially stimulating sectors like real estate, tourism, and small business growth, while also impacting savings and investment preferences.On September 18, 2025, the Central Bank of the UAE lowered the Base Rate applicable to the Overnight Deposit Facility (ODF) by 25 basis points, from 4.40% to 4.15%. This move directly followed the US Federal Reserve’s decision the previous day to reduce its Interest Rate on Reserve Balances (IORB) by the same margin.The UAE’s base rate, which serves as a floor for overnight money market interest rates, is anchored to the Fed’s IORB. Given the UAE dirham’s long-standing peg to the US dollar, changes in US interest rates are typically mirrored in the Emirates to maintain monetary stability.In addition to adjusting the base rate, the CBUAE announced that it would maintain the spread for borrowing short-term liquidity from the central bank at 50 basis points above the base rate across all standing credit facilities.This is the first interest rate cut in the UAE since the Fed’s last policy shift in December 2024, when rates were reduced to a range of 4.25%–4.50%. With the current adjustment, the Fed’s target federal funds rate now stands at 4.00%–4.25%, the lowest level since November 2022.The UAE’s rate cut is expected to translate into lower borrowing costs, with wide-ranging implications for consumer spending, business investment, and credit activity.Key sectors likely to benefit:Conversely, traditional savers and fixed-income investors may feel the downside. Returns on fixed deposits and bonds are likely to decline, pushing individuals and institutions toward riskier asset classes such as equities or real estate.Stock markets, especially those rich in growth and dividend-paying companies, are expected to benefit from the rate environment, although volatility may persist due to lingering global macroeconomic uncertainties.The UAE’s monetary policy is heavily influenced by its currency peg to the US dollar, a regime that has been in place since 1997. The exchange rate has been fixed at 1 USD = 3.6725 AED, offering a stable foundation for trade, investment, and macroeconomic planning.The peg plays a crucial role in simplifying oil trade transactions, given that oil exports are globally priced in US dollars. This alignment shields the UAE from exchange rate volatility and enhances confidence among international investors.A currency peg, or fixed exchange rate, is a mechanism by which a country’s central bank maintains its currency’s value at a constant rate against a foreign currency or a basket of currencies. The primary benefits include:As of 2024, 12 countries peg their currencies to the US dollar, with the UAE being one of the most prominent examples in the Middle East.Because of this peg, monetary policy independence in the UAE is limited. The Central Bank typically aligns its interest rate decisions with the Fed to maintain the stability of the peg and prevent capital flight or currency arbitrage.The US Federal Reserve’s rate cut on September 17, 2025, was its first of the year, driven by growing signs of a cooling labor market and persistent political pressures, including tariff-related inflationary concerns.According to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), recent economic data pointed to:The Fed emphasized that further policy adjustments will be contingent on incoming data, the evolving economic outlook, and risk assessments. This suggests a cautious but flexible approach to monetary easing in the months ahead.","The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has reduced its base interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.15%, effective September 18, 2025.

JD Vance hosts 'The Charlie Kirk Show': US VP lashes out at liberals; recalls Erika’s tribute,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-hosts-the-charlie-kirk-show-us-vp-lashes-out-at-liberals-recalls-erikas-tribute/articleshow/123911323.cms,"Trump Unleashes Crackdown After Kirk’s Murder: Visa Bans, Mass Firings, Military Probes Sweep US





US Vice-President JD Vance has said that national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk , warning that such behaviour fuels further political violence.Speaking as guest host of The Charlie Kirk Show on Monday, Vance said: “Call them out, and hell, call their employer. We don't believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility.”The vice-president took over presenting duties from his ceremonial office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with the programme livestreamed into the White House press briefing room. It was the first episode of the podcast since Kirk, 31, was fatally shot in the neck while moderating a debate at Utah Valley University last week.Vance, who flew Kirk’s body home to Arizona aboard Air Force Two, said he was “filling in for somebody who cannot be filled in for”. He recounted conversations with Kirk’s widow Erika, describing him as “a kind, loving husband”, and admitted her words had inspired him to “be a better husband and… a better father”.In his remarks, Vance directly challenged those making light of Kirk’s assassination. “There is no unity with the people who celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination,” he said.“There is no unity with someone who lies about what Charlie Kirk said in order to excuse his murder… And there is no unity with the people who fund these articles, who pay the salaries of these terrorist sympathisers who argue that Charlie Kirk, a loving husband and father, deserved a shot to the neck because he spoke words with which they disagree. ”He added: “I’m desperate for our country to be united in condemnation of the actions and the ideas that killed my friend. I want it so badly that I will tell you a difficult truth. We can only have it with people who acknowledge that political violence is unacceptable.”Other Republicans have echoed calls for accountability. Florida congressman Randy Fine said he would “demand their firing, defunding, and licence revocation”, while South Carolina’s Nancy Mace urged federal funding to be cut from universities that refuse to act.Vance, who described Kirk as a close friend and mentor, credited him with helping President Donald Trump’s re-election and with shaping the administration. “If it weren't for Charlie Kirk, I would not be the vice president of the United States,” he said.","US Vice-President JD Vance said national unity is impossible with people who celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

The Trucial States and British Control: Foundations of UAE National Day





1820–1853: A series of treaties were signed between Britain and the ruling sheikhs, starting with the defeat of the Qawasim maritime force. These agreements aimed to curb maritime conflict, prohibit the construction of warships or coastal fortifications, and maintain peace at sea.

1853: The Perpetual Maritime Truce formalized an indefinite end to hostilities at sea. Britain limited its role to maritime security without interfering in the internal governance of the emirates.

1892: The Exclusive Agreements prohibited the Trucial States from engaging with foreign powers without British approval. In exchange, the UK pledged military protection against external threats.



Path to federation: Early steps toward UAE National Day





February 18, 1968: Sheikh Zayed met with Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum of Dubai at Al Samha . They agreed to unite their emirates and invite others to join, forming the first step toward regional federation — the Union Accord.

December 2 marks a pivotal moment in the history of the United Arab Emirates — the day it became an independent, sovereign nation in 1971. But the choice of this date was not symbolic alone; it was the culmination of decades of treaties, negotiations, British withdrawal, and a shared vision among the region's leaders. This is the detailed story of how the UAE came to be, why December 2 became its National Day, and the constitutional foundations that shaped the Federation.The territory that is now the UAE was historically known as the Trucial States, a group of independent emirates along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf. British involvement in the region began in the early 19th century:British control over the region intensified in the mid-20th century, largely driven by oil exploration and geopolitical interests. They controlled oil concession grants and intervened in territorial disputes to secure exploration zones, including helping define inter-emirate boundaries in the 1950s.However, by 1968, economic constraints pushed the UK to announce a full military and political withdrawal from the Gulf by end of 1971. This move set off a chain of political activity among the Trucial States’ rulers to form a new, self-governed entity before the British departure.The initiative to form a unified state began with Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who became Ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966. Seeing the necessity of regional cooperation, he envisioned a federation that could unify resources and political will.Despite this progress, Bahrain and Qatar opted for independent statehood in August and September 1971, respectively.As the British exit approached, six emirates — Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Fujairah — committed to forming a new union.The Supreme Council of Rulers, composed of the Rulers of each emirate, became the highest federal authority. Decisions would require a majority vote — with both Abu Dhabi and Dubai needed to be part of the majority for any decision to pass.Article 138 specifically enabled the unification of the UAE Armed Forces under federal command, ensuring centralized defense policy and organization.Several shared factors helped facilitate a smooth transition to federation:Immediately after its formation, the UAE began establishing itself as a credible state in the international community:","December 2 marks the UAE’s formation, uniting seven emirates into a strong, independent federation.

Steep hike from current fee







A wave of panic gripped Indian H-1B visa holders and applicants across the United States on Saturday, with scenes of chaos unfolding at airports after US President Donald Trump signed a proclamation imposing an unprecedented USD 100,000 fee on H-1B visa petitions.At San Francisco International Airport, several Indian passengers allegedly disembarked from an Emirates flight just minutes before takeoff, fearing they might not be able to return to the US if they left. The flight was reportedly delayed for over three hours as ground staff scrambled to manage the sudden exits.Videos circulating on X and Instagram, though not independently verified by TOI, showed a cabin packed with Indian nationals. Passengers could be seen in panic after news of the H-1B visa fee hike began spreading.“An international flight packed with Indians (coming for Durga Puja) from Bay Area had completed boarding & was due to leave SFO Airport, when the news about H-1B visa new rules just broke out. Indians aboard panicked, pleaded to get off the plane,” one X user posted.The proclamation has triggered widespread anxiety in the Indian diaspora.Several major US firms — including Microsoft, Amazon and JP Morgan — reportedly urged employees on H-1B visas to return to the US before September 21 or avoid international travel altogether to prevent potential visa complications.Currently, the cost of filing an H-1B petition ranges between USD 2,000 and 5,000, depending on employer size and other factors.

'Own wedding trip cancelled'



'Travel ban'



'Who's next?'



Indian H-1B visa holders in US described the ""crazy sense of panic"" that ensued the community after Donald Trump-administration approved $1,00,000 fee on the work visas on Saturday.The sudden move, coming just weeks before Diwali and the year-end holiday season, has left families in turmoil, many cancelling flights at the last minute, including one individual who called off their own wedding trip to India. With the new rule linked to restrictions on re-entry, even those holding valid visas fear being stranded abroad.US admin, however, tried to bring order to chaos saying that those leaving the country or visiting India ""don't need to rush back before Sunday or pay the $100,000 fee"", adding that the fee was ""only for new and not current existing holders.""An individual revealed how a person cancelled their own wedding trip last minute ""because they don't know what to do.”“People who are standing in boarding lines at airports, people who are leaving for their own wedding tomorrow, things like that. They are cancelling because they don't know what to do,” PTI quoted them saying.Moreover, one said how people have cancelled Diwali plans and December holiday plans because of the move.“People had plans to travel to India for Diwali. They're all in a flux and not sure what to do. Families book tickets for Diwali, for the December holiday season well in advance. This is the time when most people travel,"" they said.“This is the time when people actually want to leave and be with family during the holiday season. Now this has happened. Does that mean that I cannot travel this year? That’s another sense of ‘oh my god’,” they added.Terming it a ""travel ban"", one person questioned the administration over lack of clarity over procedure regarding the move.“This is a travel ban! Even if a person has a valid H-1B visa stamped on their passport, if they are travelling, or are on vacation, you cannot enter the US unless they have proof of the USD 1,00,000 payment. No one knows what the process is, what the fine print is. There’s absolute panic,” PTI quoted the person saying.Citing internal memos by major tech companies, one said, “The biggest question that has come out is that you cannot leave the country.”The memos advised employees against travelling abroad and urged those already outside the US to return before the September 21 deadline, when Trump’s proclamation is set to take effect.“The number one thing that all of the employers are just saying is that if you are inside the country right now, do not leave,” PTI quoted one saying.Raising doubts over who could be the new target of Trump's tightening of immigration rules, one asked, “Will students on F-1 visas or those on L-1 work visas be next.”“What happens to my spouse who's on a H4 visa, can they travel? None of these things are super clear. Another thing that has caused panic for a lot of people is that when such news comes out, nobody talks about the specifics. Nobody's able to help,” PTI quoted them saying.","Indian H-1B visa holders in US described the ""crazy sense of panic"" that ensued the community after Donald Trump-administration approved $1,00,000 fee on the work visas on Saturday.

‘Majority American-owned’: White House outlines TikTok deal; signing soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/majority-american-owned-white-house-outlines-tiktok-deal-signing-soon/articleshow/124023302.cms,"



The White House has given fresh details on a deal over TikTok’s future in the United States, saying an agreement is “close to being finalised” and will ensure American control of the platform’s operations, data, and algorithm.Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that the arrangement, reached after months of negotiations with China, would make TikTok “majority owned by Americans in the United States” with six of seven seats on its new governing board held by Americans. “The data and privacy will be led by one of America's greatest tech companies, Oracle, and the algorithm will also be controlled by America as well,” she said.Leavitt praised officials who led the talks. “Great credit to Secretary Besant and Ambassador Jamison Greer and our vice president, JD Vance, who really led the charge on this and have been negotiating with the Chinese for months,” she said. “They were able to accomplish a deal that puts America first and keeps Tick Tock open for all of the young Americans and all of the small businesses who have benefited greatly from selling their products and really creating a name for themselves on this highly popular app. ”President Donald Trump, who discussed the deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a phone call on Friday, echoed that confidence. “We have great American patriots that are buying it — very, very substantial people, people that love our country,” he told reporters.“And they’re very smart technologically, and they will not let anything bad happen to TikTok.”Leavitt stressed that Trump had “recognized the need to protect Americans’ privacy and data while also keeping this app open” and even credited TikTok as “a vital part of our democratic process.” She added that the president believed the platform, along with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, played a role in energising young voters in the last election.While China has yet to confirm the reported approval of the deal, Leavitt insisted the framework was set. “All of those details have already been agreed upon. Now we just need this deal to be signed. And that will be happening, I anticipate, in the coming days,” she said.Congress had previously passed legislation mandating a TikTok ban in January unless Chinese parent company ByteDance divested its US operations. Trump has repeatedly delayed its enforcement while pursuing a deal he says will ensure “very good control” of the platform.","The White House has given fresh details on a deal over TikTok’s future in the United States.

'Concerned': US Chamber of Commerce reacts to Trump’s $100k visa fee; calls move disruptive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/concerned-us-chamber-of-commerce-reacts-to-trumps-100k-visa-fee-calls-move-disruptive/articleshow/124023087.cms,"



US President Donald Trump’s decision to increase visa sponsorship fees has triggered concern from the US Chamber of Commerce, which warned of widespread consequences for workers, families, and businesses. Trump signed an Executive Order raising the fee for companies sponsoring H-1B applicants to $100,000, a sharp jump from the current level of around $2,000 to $5,000.“We’re concerned about the impact on employees, their families, and employers. We’re working with the Administration and our members to understand the full implications and the best path forward,” the Chamber of Commerce said in response.The proclamation, which takes effect immediately, stipulates that the total fee for three years of H-1B sponsorship will amount to $300,000, according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The move is part of Trump’s broader effort to crack down on immigration, with the White House arguing that the visa system has been exploited to undercut American workers. Trump said the H-1B programme, designed to bring in specialised, high-skilled talent, had been abused to replace Americans with “lower-paid, lower-skilled labour,” undermining both economic and national security.India, which has long been the largest beneficiary of the H-1B programme, reacted with concern.“This measure is likely to have humanitarian consequences by way of the disruption caused for families,” External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, adding that the government hoped “these disruptions can be addressed suitably by the US authorities.” New Delhi has instructed its missions to assist Indian nationals attempting to return to the US before the new rules come into force.Industry groups have also warned of major disruption. Nasscom, representing India’s $283 billion IT sector, said: “A one-day deadline creates considerable uncertainty for businesses, professionals, and students across the world. Policy changes of this scale are best introduced with adequate transition periods, allowing organisations and individuals to plan effectively and minimise disruption.”Indians account for more than 70 per cent of H-1B visa holders, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services. The sudden fee hike is expected to affect Indian technology companies most severely, with both Indian and American industries now weighing the implications as they look for ways forward.","The US Chamber of Commerce has warned of widespread consequences for workers, families, and businesses.

California governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday signed a law prohibiting most law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from covering their faces while conducting official business.The state is the first in the US to enact such a ban, a direct response to the recent immigration raids in Los Angeles where masked federal agents made mass arrests. The raids triggered days of violent protests in June and led President Donald Trump to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to the city.Newsom, a Democrat and frequent Trump critic, framed the measure as a ""defence"" of California’s diversity, noting that 27 per cent of residents are foreign-born. “We celebrate that diversity. It’s what makes California great. It’s what makes America great. It is under assault,” he said, according to the Associated Press.The new rule bars officers from wearing coverings such as ski masks and neck gaiters, though exceptions exist for undercover work, medical masks, tactical gear, and state police.The law’s enforceability against federal agents remains unclear. A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official called the legislation “despicable,” arguing it endangers officers.DHS has already warned California and other Democratic-led states that it would take “all appropriate measures” if they continue resisting federal immigration detainers.Newsom, a potential candidate for US presidency in 2028, asserted the law would help California push back against “federal overreach.”Trump administration officials have defended the use of face coverings, arguing that immigration agents face mounting harassment in public and online as they carry out the president’s mass deportation agenda. Masking their identities, they say, is necessary to protect both the officers and their families.Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin noted in a statement this week that federal agents are already required to identify themselves and wear vests marked with ICE or Homeland Security during operations.","California governor Gavin Newsom signed a law prohibiting most law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from covering their faces.

In recent days, US forces, acting under Trump’s instructions, have carried out three strikes targeting Venezuelan vessels allegedly involved in narcoterrorism.In August, the US State Department increased the reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Maduro to $50 million, up from $25 million.

Some now live in relief camps, others under the open sky.” He added that two villagers drowned while attempting to flee.Officials declared Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur tehsils safe after a major flood wave passed through Head Panjnad.Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu confirmed that 100,000 people had been evacuated from Jalalpur Pirwala alone in three days.Breaches in Shujabad and Jalalpur Pirwala are now being filled, while helicopters and drones drop food and medicine into cut-off areas. Boats continue to ferry supplies into rural belts.At a press briefing in Bahawalpur, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Panjnad Headworks still faced a “high flood” but levels had dropped from 700,000 cusecs earlier this week to 575,000 cusecs on Saturday. By evening, the Flood Forecasting Division reported further decline to 492,695 cusecs.“There is no threat to Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur cities,” Kathia assured, adding that water in Bahawalpur would also recede within 24 hours. He called the scale of evacuation “historic,” stressing that Multan could have faced forced evacuations if operations were delayed.According to official data, 4,447 mouzas across 28 districts have been inundated. Alongside the mass displacement of people, more than 2.19 million cattle were rescued and shifted to higher ground.For now, the rivers appear to be calming, the Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala was recorded at 95,000 cusecs, categorised as medium flood. But for the millions already uprooted, the crisis has only just begun.","Nearly 2.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes and at least 101 lives have been lost.

Protests Erupt in Pakistan, as Imran Khan Supporters Call for His Release

“

(With ANI inputs)





The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment, as his legal team lodged an appeal with the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture.The elder son, Sulaiman Khan, condemned Khan's treatment in a statement attached to the appeal:Our father is being kept in conditions that no human being should endure. These are violations of his rights, and they amount to torture.”The younger son, Kasim Khan, said:The UN has already recognised that our father’s imprisonment is arbitrary and unlawful. What he is enduring now shows how far the regime will go to break him. But he will not be broken.”Sulaiman and Kasim are the cricketer-turned-politician’s sons with British filmmaker Jemima Goldsmith, with whom he was married for nine years until 2004. They live in the UK with Goldsmith.The appeal, filed by the US-based law firm Perseus Strategies on behalf of Khan’s legal team, alleged a “systematic pattern of abuse, including prolonged solitary confinement, denial of medical care, contaminated food, and restricted access to legal counsel and family visits.”His lawyers argued that these conditions breach Pakistan’s obligations under the UN Convention against Torture (CAT) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). They urged the UN to press authorities to safeguard the former PM’s physical and mental well-being.Khan has been in prison since August 2023 after being charged in multiple cases.","The sons of jailed former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said their father “will not be broken” by his “unlawful” imprisonment.

Aid meant for relief diverted? Pakistan funding reconstruction of LeT HQ destroyed in Op Sindoor; what intel says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/aid-meant-for-relief-diverted-pakistan-funding-reconstruction-of-let-hq-destroyed-in-op-sindoor-what-intel-says/articleshow/123878923.cms,"Intel Reveals Pak Using Aid To Rebuild LeT HQ Hit In Op Sindoor, Experts Say ‘Time To Strike Again’

Poll Do you believe the reconstruction of LeT's Markaz Taiba is a threat to regional security? Yes, it poses a significant threat. No, it will not impact security.

How India destroyed LeT HQ



Why its reconstruction is a matter of concern?







Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba, which was destroyed in precision airstrikes during Operation Sindoor on May 7. According to ANI, citing an agency dossier, LeT has launched fundraising campaigns under the pretext of flood relief to support the redevelopment project.Moreover, Islamabad has already allocated PKR 4 crore, though the group estimates costs at over PKR 15 crore. The dossier stated that its army and ISI remain involved in sustaining and reviving LeT.Senior commanders Maulana Abu Zar and Yunus Shah Bukhari are overseeing the project, due by February 2026, mirroring past cases where LeT diverted humanitarian aid, including most of the 2005 earthquake relief, to militant infrastructure.This comes amidst Pakistan's continuous assertions on global platforms that it was combating terrorism.The Indian Air Force (IAF), earlier this year, showcased the extensive damage caused to LeT Muridke headquarters during Operation Sindoor, highlighting the precision and reach of the strikes.Muridke, home to LeT’s Markaz Taiba, was identified as a critical target. The strikes hit senior leadership residential areas and office buildings where commanders convened for planning and operations.The IAF showed videos captured directly from the weapons, pointing out the level of devastation within the complex.The airstrikes reportedly killed around a dozen high-value terrorists, including Yusuf Azhar, the IC-814 hijacker, Abu Jundal (also known as Mudassar), the Muridke chief of LeT, and the son of the planner of the 2016 Nagrota attack. The operation, conducted in retaliation for the Pahalgam killings, reinforced India’s ability to carry out precise, high-impact missions inside enemy territory.The ongoing reconstruction of LeT Markaz Taiba headquarters has raised serious concerns regarding regional security, given the facility’s central role in training and radicalizing terrorists. Established in 2000, the complex serves as both a residence for senior commanders and a training ground where recruits are instructed in intelligence gathering, arms handling, and other operational skills. Analysts warn that reviving the facility could strengthen LeT’s operational capabilities and enable the recruitment of new militants.Markaz Taiba functions as the “alma mater” of LeT, providing courses that combine physical and arms training with ideological indoctrination. The center attracts recruits from within Pakistan and abroad, using religious and radicalization programs to cultivate loyalty and operational skills among future militants. Its facilities, including a mosque and guest house financed by Osama bin Laden, underscore the longstanding support the organization has received from international terror networks.The scale of the operation at Markaz Taiba further amplifies the threat. The facility reportedly trains around 1,000 students annually, preparing them for operational roles within LeT. Past evidence has shown that graduates of this center have gone on to participate in high-profile attacks, including the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, highlighting the direct link between the facility and acts of cross-border terrorism targeting India.LeT’s historical connection with Pakistan’s intelligence apparatus adds another layer of concern. Senior commanders at the facility, including those who oversaw training for the 26/11 perpetrators, have operated under the guidance of the ISI.","Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba.

Hamas-style Ambush Stuns Pak: 12 Soldiers FALL Into Pakistani Taliban Trap, Drones Captured | Watch





A Pakistani Taliban ambush in northwest Pakistan on Saturday resulted in the deaths of at least 12 soldiers, as confirmed by local government and security officials to AFP.During a military convoy's passage through South Waziristan district at 4:00 am, ""armed men opened fire from both sides with heavy weapons"", resulting in 12 security personnel deaths and four injuries, according to a local government official.The area's security officer verified the casualties and reported that the assailants captured the convoy's weaponry.The Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban, took responsibility for the attack via social media.This incident ranks among the most severe attacks in recent months within Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the TTP previously controlled significant territories until a 2014 military operation forced their retreat.Since the Afghan Taliban's return to power in Kabul in 2021, militant activities have intensified in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border regions. Although distinct organisations, the TTP maintains close ties with the Afghan Taliban.Pakistan contends that Afghanistan fails to remove militants who use Afghan soil to attack Pakistan, whilst Kabul authorities reject these claims.Local residents across various Khyber Pakhtunkhwa districts have recently reported TTP-branded graffiti appearing on buildings, expressing concerns about a potential return to the group's previous control during the height of the US ""War on Terror"".A high-ranking local government official recently informed AFP about increased TTP fighter presence and attack frequency.Since January 1, approximately 460 individuals, predominantly security forces personnel, have lost their lives in attacks by anti-state armed groups in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces, according to AFP's records.Pakistan experienced its most lethal period in nearly ten years during the previous year, with over 1,600 fatalities, including almost half being soldiers and police officers, as reported by the Islamabad-based Center for Research and Security Studies.","Pakistani Taliban ambush in northwest Pakistan kills at least 12 soldiers.

KATHMANDU: The 'Gen Z' group on Saturday demanded the arrest of deposed prime minister K P Sharma Oli and then home minister Ramesh Lekhak over their alleged role in a shootout that killed 19 people during the anti-government protests on September 8.Addressing a press conference at Sambad Dabali here, Dr Nicholas Bushal, one of the advisers to the Gen Z group that spearheaded the protests, said Oli, Lekhak and Chief District Officer of Kathmandu Chhabi Rijal should be arrested immediately as they were directly responsible for the shootout at Naya Baneshwor in which 19 activists were killed.Bhushal also demanded the formation of a high-level probe commission to investigate the wealth of all high-ranking leaders and government officials since 1990.Separately, the Gen Z activists also organised a sit-in demanding Oli and Lekhak's arrest at Maitighar Mandala near Singhdurbar Secretariat in Kathmandu, from where they started their protest rally on September 8.At least 72 people, including three policemen, were among the dead during the violent protests against alleged corruption and a ban on social media on September 8 and 9.On Friday, the former prime minister denied that he had given any shooting orders during the Gen Z demonstrations, saying bullets were fired at protesters from automatic guns that the police did not possess and called for a probe into the matter.In his first public statement since his ouster, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) chairman blamed the infiltrators for the violence during the ""peaceful protest"" by Gen-Z.""The government didn't order to shoot at the demonstrators,"" 73-year-old Oli said in a message issued on the occasion of Constitution Day.""The bullets were fired at the protesters from automatic guns, which were not possessed by the police personnel, and this must be investigated,"" Oli said.Oli quit on September 9 shortly after hundreds of agitators entered his office demanding his resignation.Meanwhile, Supreme Court Chief Justice Prakash Man Singh Raut on Saturday said that the apex court had not issued an order to ban social media sites.""The Supreme Court had not ordered the government to shut down social media sites,"" CJ Raut said while talking to the media in Kathmandu.The apex court had urged the government to regularise the social media sites through formulating necessary laws which is a normal international practice, he said.The Oli-led government had banned 26 social media sites citing the Supreme Court's order, which sparked protests from the Gen Z group on September 8. The ban on social media was lifted on the night of September 8.On September 12, former chief justice Sushila Karki took oath as Nepal's first woman prime minister to lead an interim government.","The 'Gen Z' group on Saturday demanded the arrest of deposed prime minister K P Sharma Oli and then home minister Ramesh Lekhak over their alleged role in a shootout.

A British couple, who were detained in Afghanistan earlier this year, have been freed after the Qatari-mediated negotiations.Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband Peter, 80, were taken into custody by the Taliban’s interior ministry on February 1 and moved to a maximum-security prison in Kabul in March, AP reported.The couple have lived in Afghanistan for 18 years, running “Rebuild,” an organisation providing education and training programmes. Together since the 1960s, they married in Kabul in 1970.""Two British nationals named Peter and Barbara Reynolds, who had violated the laws of Afghanistan, were released from custody today following the judicial process,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi said on social media.He added that the government ""does not view the matters of citizens from a political or transactional angle"".“God is good, as they say in Afghanistan,” Barbie Reynolds said after she arrived at Kabul International Airport to fly out of the country.The Reynolds’ family members in the U.K. repeatedly called for the couple’s release, saying they were being mistreated and held on undisclosed charges. While the Taliban rejected the abuse allegations, they have never explained what prompted their detention, AP reported.“This is a moment of immense joy for our family, and we are deeply thankful to everyone who played a role in securing their release,” the family said in a statement after their release, mentioning Qatar and the British governments.“This experience has reminded us of the power of diplomacy, empathy, and international co-operation. While the road to recovery will be long as our parents regain their health and spend time with their family, today is a day of tremendous joy and relief.”Their son Jonathan told Sky News in April his parents had ""never heard one accusation or one charge"". He said the British govt had offered to evacuate them when the Taliban took over, to which they replied: ""Why would we leave these people in their darkest hour?Qatar, an energy-rich nation on the Arabian Peninsula that mediated talks between the U.S. and the Taliban before the American withdrawal, assisted in releasing the Reynolds couple from Afghanistan, a diplomat said. The couple left Afghanistan on Friday. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations involved in the case.Earlier this month, the Taliban said they had reached an agreement with US envoys on a prisoner exchange as part of an effort to normalise relations. The meeting came after the Taliban in March released US citizen George Glezmann, who was abducted while travelling through Afghanistan as a tourist. Afghanistan remains a focus of US President Donald Trump. On Thursday, while visiting the UK, Trump suggested that he was working to reestablish a US presence at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Zakir Jalaly, an official at the Taliban’s Foreign Ministry, dismissed the idea.Reynolds couple were flown to Doha and are now on their way home to be reunited with their family.","Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband Peter, 80, were taken into custody by the Taliban’s interior ministry on February 1 and moved to a maximum-security prison in Kabul in March.

Today is Constitution Day — the day the Nepali people, after 70 years of struggle, saw the constitution enacted by the

Constituent Assembly

they themselves had elected. It is the day when a democratic republic, a federal inclusive system, and the rights of the people were established.

The challenges we faced while drafting this constitution are still fresh in your memory. Even overcoming blockades and threats to the country’s

sovereignty

, the constitution was promulgated. Therefore, Nepal’s constitution is a blueprint for the future that the Nepali people have written for themselves.

After the constitution was enacted, we were building transport structures connecting north and south to make the landlocked country accessible and resilient against blockades. We had also signed transport agreements with our northern neighbor and were expanding the strength of our sovereignty. We were laying the foundations for development structures and the economy was growing steadily.

Last week, during what was supposed to be a peaceful Jan Gatha (Jan-G) protest, intruders entered — as the organizers themselves had claimed. Conspirators who infiltrated caused violence, resulting in the deaths of our youth. The government had not ordered the demonstrators to be fired upon. The investigation must determine how automatic weapons, which the police did not possess, were used. I again express my grief over the incident, pay tribute to the deceased youth, and wish speedy recovery to the injured.

At this moment, our constitution is under a major attack. After my resignation from the position of Prime Minister, Singha Durbar was set on fire — the map of Nepal was burned, and the national symbol was targeted for erasure. Offices of public representatives, courts, business institutions, political party offices, the homes of leaders and activists, and personal property were systematically destroyed.

I will not speak much today about the

conspiracy

behind this; time itself will reveal many truths. Was our country truly being destroyed, or was anger being stirred up merely through fabricated narratives of destruction? Our new generation will realize this for themselves. Society that once criticized the crowds at airports will, in time, understand what it means when external movement is blocked. Our new generation will come to understand all of this.

However, this is something that must be understood now; if not, our country’s sovereignty will exist only in history.

Our youth must have read the history of Bhim Malla’s death sentence. Bhim Malla, after expanding the country’s borders and returning, was executed upon his return, leaving only regret as the option. Outcomes of discontent fueled beyond reality only serve as lessons in regret, and such regret will deepen the memory of the nation being built.

All Nepalis across generations must unite — to face attacks on our sovereignty and defend our constitution. Sovereignty is our existence, and the constitution is the armor of our freedom. Only our unity can lift and protect the country from this unimaginable crisis.

I appeal to everyone —

Let us protect the constitution, let us defend our sovereignty.

Nepal In Flames: PM KP Oli Resigns, Flees In Army Chopper As Gen Z Protesters Burn Down Parliament





Days after massive unrest upended Nepal’s political situation, deposed Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has shifted from army protection to a private residence. According to news agency PTI, citing Nepal army sources, Oli spent nine days under army security before moving out.Oli had flown to an army barracks -- believed to be in the Shivapuri forest area, north of Kathmandu on September 9, immediately after the Gen Z-led protests turned violent and he resigned as Prime Minister.After nine days in army security, the chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) (CPN-UML) relocated to a private location, the Nepal Army confirmed.However, his current address has not been officially disclosed. Media reports indicate that Oli has shifted to a private house in the Gundu area of Bhaktapur district, about 15 km east of Kathmandu.During the second day of the protests on September 9, Gen Z demonstrators burned Oli’s house in Balkot, Bhaktapur, to ashes. On the same day, while Oli was at the official residence of the Nepal Prime Minister, protesters also partially torched the Prime Minister’s Office in Balkot. He was safely evacuated by a Nepal Army helicopter.Several other senior political figures -- including former Prime Ministers Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda,’ Sher Bahadur Deuba, Jhalanath Khanal, Madhav Kumar Nepal, and others -- had also taken shelter under army protection for a few days. At present, only Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba and his spouse, former foreign minister Arzju Rana Deuba, remain under army security. The couple sustained injuries during the protests and are currently receiving hospital treatment under military protection.Meanwhile, the CPN-UML, led by Oli, is planning a separate event to mark Constitution Day on September 19 at Chyasal in Lalitpur district, where the party’s central office is located. However, it remains uncertain whether Oli will attend the programme.Nepal will observe Constitution Day on Ashoj 3 of the Bikram Era calendar—September 19 this year—marking the promulgation of the country’s constitution drafted by the Constituent Assembly on September 20, 2015.The Nepal government is organising a grand celebration in Kathmandu on September 19 to mark Constitution Day and has declared a public holiday for the occasion. President Ramchandra Paudel, Prime Minister Sushila Karki, the Nepal army chief, ministers and other dignitaries are scheduled to attend.","Deposed PM KP Sharma Oli has shifted from army protection to a private residence.

With Nepal slowly regaining normalcy after the deadly Sept 8-9 protests that left more than 70 people dead, police have turned their focus to identifying those behind the violence. The crackdown has triggered a 'digital retreat' among many protesters, who are deleting social media accounts or going silent online to avoid detection.Nepal police said they have received nearly 30,000 emails from citizens containing photos and videos that document arson, looting, and attacks on public buildings. The evidence was submitted after an appeal by police urging people to share digital material pertaining to the protests while promising not to disclose the identity of the senders to ensure their safety.DIG Binod Ghimire, spokesperson of Nepal police, said the huge volume of citizen responses received would aid the investigation. ""The videos and photos that we have got from citizens will help us track down those involved in the violence. We will analyse the data and act accordingly. We urge people to share more evidence, if any.""His statement came amid another appeal by Kathmandu police cautioning people against buying looted items.During the protests, many had looted valuables from banks, supermarkets, jewellery shops and other business establishments. Some perpetrators had also looted weapons and other items from police stations across the country.Earlier on Wednesday, ministers of the newly-formed interim govt visited the federal parliament building to assess the destruction. Rameshwor Prasad Khanal, the interim finance minister, said: ""The damage to properties is extensive across the country. We are assessing the loss after which necessary action would be taken to repair or rebuild properties. Our PM has already said that the vandalism and arson was a criminal act which will be punished. Police are therefore working towards bringing the perpetrators to justice.""Meanwhile, in Kathmandu, the sense of unease is palpable, especially among younger residents. Many say the fear of being linked to the unrest has changed everyday routines. ""Youngsters are now not just hesitant to come out of their homes but have also deleted their social media accounts,"" said Prashant Shrestha, who runs a souvenir shop in Thamel. ""There's fear of being identified for the loot and vandalism that caused so much loss to both public and private property. ""Ram Bahadur Chhetri, 64, a retired govt employee, termed the vandalism as a 'brainless act' while demanding strict action against perpetrators. ""Our country had somehow managed to get back on its feet after the 2015 earthquake . Now, again some people under the garb of protests against corruption, caused unforgettable damage. It will take years for us to cope with this loss,"" said Chhetri.","Nepal police have received nearly 30,000 emails from citizens containing photos and videos that document arson, looting, and attacks on public buildings. The crackdown has triggered a 'digital retreat' among many protesters who are deleting social media accounts or going silent online to avoid detection.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123984691,imgsize-1114873,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Why is Trump eyeing Bagram airbase?







United States president Donald Trump on Thursday said he was working to ""get back"" Bagram airbase, which the United States gave up control of after the 2021 Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.""We're trying to get it back, by the way, that could be a little breaking news. We're trying to get it back because they need things from us. We want that base back,"" Trump said at a press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.Trump claimed his intention to return American forces to Afghanistan’s Bagram Airbase is because “China now controls Bagram.”About a month earlier, Trump had suggested the US might return to Afghanistan, saying, “We are going to keep a small force on Bagram” to counter China’s growing influence.Trump stressed that his focus on Bagram was not about Afghanistan itself.“We wanted to keep this base because of China, not because of Afghanistan,” he said, noting the airbase’s proximity to China’s nuclear facilities, “just an hour” away, as its key strategic value.Bagram Airbase has long been one of the United States’ most important military assets in South Asia, valued for both its location and its capabilities.Located about 40 kilometres north of Kabul, it sits close to the borders of China, Pakistan, Iran, and Central Asia, giving the US a forward-operating hub near some of the world’s most volatile regions.Its proximity to China’s Xinjiang region, where Beijing maintains nuclear and military facilities, made it particularly significant for American strategic planning.During the US presence in Afghanistan, Bagram was the largest American airbase in the country. It had multiple runways capable of handling heavy bombers and transport aircraft, housed thousands of US and Nato troops at its peak, and included extensive infrastructure such as command centers, detention facilities, and logistics hubs. This made it the nerve center of US military operations in Afghanistan for nearly two decades.Beyond Afghanistan, Bagram gave Washington the ability to project power across South and Central Asia, carry out surveillance, support counterterrorism missions, and monitor regional adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, and Pakistan. Symbolically too, the base represented the scale of America’s military footprint in the region.Its abrupt abandonment during the 2021 withdrawal was seen by many analysts as a strategic mistake, as it left the facility open to Taliban control and raised concerns about possible Chinese interest in the site.","US president Donald Trump said he was working to ""get back"" Bagram airbase.

Putin Warns UK Against Interference In Ukraine Truce Negotiations | Watch





UK secret intelligence service chief Richard Moore on Friday said there is “absolutely no evidence” that Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to negotiate peace in Ukraine, accusing him of deceiving the world with false promises of dialogue.In a parting speech at the British consulate in Istanbul, Moore said Putin was “stringing us along” while seeking to impose his “imperial will by all means at his disposal.” “Bluntly, Putin has bitten off more than he can chew. He thought he was going to win an easy victory, but he – and many others – underestimated the Ukrainians,” Moore said.Moore warned that the Russian leader is “mortgaging his country’s future for his own personal legacy and a distorted version of history,” adding that the war is accelerating Russia’s decline.The head of Britain’s secret intelligence service, will retire in September this year after serving five years in the role. He will be preceded by UK's first woman intelligence officer, Blaise Metreweli.Moore, a former UK ambassador to Turkey, said the 2022 invasion had backfired on Moscow by strengthening Ukrainian national identity, speeding Kyiv’s westward shift, and prompting Sweden and Finland to join NATO. “Putin has sought to convince the world that Russian victory is inevitable. But he lies. He lies to the world. He lies to his people. Perhaps he even lies to himself,” Moore told reporters.The Ukraine conflict, now in its third year, continues to rage primarily in the country’s east, with tens of thousands killed since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February 2022.","Richard Moore, head of Britain's secret intelligence service, will retire in September this year.

‘Do As I Say Or…’: Trump Loses Temper At NATO Nations Buying Russian Oil; Warns Them To Stop…





US President Donald Trump claimed that the UK Prime Minister supported his criticism of NATO and EU countries over their continued energy purchases from Russia, despite the West’s broader stance on sanctions, calling it a key obstacle to achieving peace in Ukraine.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his return to Washington after a state visit to the United Kingdom, Trump said, “The UK Prime Minister was embarrassed about me calling out NATO and EU countries over buying oil from Russia. And he said that’s not good. He appreciated that I said it, but he said that’s not good. How about that?”Trump further stated that the UK PM Keir Starmer expressed willingness to take action on the issue. “He also agrees to stop buying oil from Russia, and he’s willing to impose sanctions too. And he’s not one of the culprits in terms of Russian oil,”Trump added.The remarks appear to underline ongoing tensions over Europe's energy dependence on Russia, which has remained a point of friction between Washington and several NATO allies. While Trump's comments suggest some level of private consensus with the UK on the issue, there has been no official confirmation yet from Downing Street regarding any new commitments.He reiterated his belief that cutting off Russian oil exports is essential to bringing an end to the war in Ukraine. “Ultimately, if oil prices go down, or if Russia is not selling oil, they have no choice but to settle. When EU or Nato nations are buying oil from Russia, that’s not the greatest thing,” he said.Trump also admitted that the conflict in Ukraine has proven more complex than he had initially expected. He said he felt “let down” by Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite earlier confidence in their personal rapport to help negotiate a peace deal.Trump has consistently criticised Nato and EU nations for what he sees as a contradiction - relying on US defence support while continuing economic ties with Russia through energy trade.(With inputs from agencies)",US President Donald Trump claimed that the UK Prime Minister supported his criticism of NATO and EU countries over their continued energy purchases from Russia.

EU Chief Kaja Kallas To India: Rethink Moscow Ties Or Risk Free Trade Agreement With European Union





The UK has carried out its first deportation under a new returns treaty with France, with home secretary Shabana Mehmood calling it an “important first step” in efforts to curb illegal English Channel crossings.“This is an important first step to securing our borders. It sends a message to people crossing in small boats: if you enter the UK illegally, we will seek to remove you,” Mehmood said Thursday. She added that the government would continue to challenge “last-minute, vexatious” attempts in court, and stressed that Britain would continue to provide refuge through “safe, legal and managed routes — not dangerous crossings. ”According to UK home office sources, the deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August. He was flown on a commercial flight to Paris under the “one-in, one-out” deal signed with France. Once returned, he will be offered a voluntary repatriation scheme to India; refusal would bar him from applying for asylum and could result in enforced removal.The pilot agreement, which began in August and will run until June 2026, allows the UK to deport migrants who arrive illegally while accepting an equal number from France through a new safe and legal asylum pathway, subject to strict eligibility and security checks.The first arrivals under this reciprocal route are expected in Britain in the coming days.Official data show that 2,715 Indian nationals were in UK immigration detention as of August — more than double last year’s figure, an increase of 108 per cent. The deported man is among the first group of migrants held by UK Border Force since the treaty came into force.According to the home office, more than 35,000 people with no right to remain were removed from the UK in the past year, with returns of foreign criminals up 14 per cent and asylum-related removals up 28 per cent.","The deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August.

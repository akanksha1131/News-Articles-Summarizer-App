How did the clash unfold?



What’s happening now?



Assad’s fall and its aftermath



More than 70 people were killed and dozens wounded on Friday in violent clashes between Syrian security forces and gunmen loyal to deposed ruler Bashar al-Assad in the coastal province of Latakia, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).""More than 70 killed and dozens wounded and captured in bloody clashes and ambushes on the Syrian coast between members of the Ministry of Defence and Interior and militants from the defunct regime's army,"" the monitor said in a post on X.The violence erupted in Jableh, a town in Latakia province, as security forces launched operations to root out Assad loyalists who have regrouped in the mountainous coastal region.Earlier reports had put the death toll at 48, with SOHR describing the fighting as the ""most violent"" since Assad was ousted by Islamist rebels in December. The dead included 16 security personnel and 28 pro-Assad fighters, while others were wounded or captured.The clashes reportedly began when gunmen linked to an Assad-era commander, Suhail al-Hassan , attacked security patrols and checkpoints. In response, government forces launched helicopter strikes on a village in Latakia.“The armed groups that our security forces were clashing with in the Latakia countryside were affiliated with the war criminal Suhail al-Hassan, who committed the most heinous massacres against the Syrian people,” Latakia's security director Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Kunaifati told state news agency SANA.Al-Hassan, nicknamed “The Tiger”, was a key military commander under Assad, leading special forces in major battles against the rebels in 2015. His hometown, Beit Ana, became a focal point of the latest tensions after residents reportedly disrupted security forces during an operation to arrest an arms dealer.Security forces have been deployed in and around Jableh to restore order. Reports indicate that Alawite community leaders have accused the government of targeting peaceful protesters in the helicopter strikes. The Alawites, Assad’s sectarian base, largely backed him during his rule but are now caught in the turmoil following his downfall.SANA, citing defence ministry sources, confirmed that reinforcements have been sent to the Jableh region to bring the situation under control.The latest violence is part of Syria’s ongoing instability following the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December 2024. His ouster, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) rebels, marked the end of his 24-year rule and the Assad family’s five-decade hold on power.In the final hours before Damascus fell to the rebels, Assad fled the country in secrecy, misleading his aides about Russian military support.""He told his commanders and associates after his Moscow trip that military support was coming,"" said Hadi al-Bahra, the head of Syria’s main opposition abroad. ""He was lying to them. The message he received from Moscow was negative.""As his government collapsed, security forces abandoned their posts, allowing rebels to seize control of Damascus. Assad’s brother Maher and other key regime figures also fled, while some were ambushed by rebel fighters.Since Assad’s departure, the HTS-led insurgents have promised an inclusive government, but concerns remain over their Islamist ties.","Violence erupted in Jableh, a town in Latakia province, as security forces launched operations to root out Assad loyalists.

Donald Trump signs order mandating upfront bond payments in lawsuits challenging his policies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-signs-order-mandating-upfront-bond-payments-in-lawsuits-challenging-his-policies/articleshow/118772615.cms,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday directing government lawyers to request that plaintiffs post bonds when suing to block his policies, potentially imposing steep financial barriers for challengers, Reuters reported.The order mandates that US Justice Department attorneys ask judges to require plaintiffs to cover the government’s costs and damages if a policy they seek to halt is later upheld as lawful. The money would need to be posted in advance as a bond.Judges are not obligated to grant these requests, but if they do, plaintiffs could be forced to provide significant sums before proceeding with their lawsuits.""Federal courts should hold litigants accountable for their misrepresentations and ill-granted injunctions,"" Trump stated in the order, accusing “activist organizations” of securing improper and excessive legal blocks against his administration’s policies.The directive comes in response to more than 100 lawsuits filed against Trump's efforts to downsize the federal bureaucracy, cut government spending, and reshape immigration and social policies. While the administration has faced legal setbacks, it has also secured some victories in recent weeks.Government lawyers have already sought bonds in multiple cases, including one challenging Trump’s freeze on $3 trillion in federal loans, grants, and financial aid. However, U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan rejected the request, stating it would ""defy logic"" to ""hold plaintiffs hostage"" with a bond. She has temporarily blocked the freeze while reviewing the case.Additional bond requests have been made in lawsuits over cuts to medical research grants and the funding freeze, though judges have yet to rule on them.","President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday directing government lawyers to request that plaintiffs post bonds when suing to block his policies.

PARIS: A prominent Iranian pop singer who made a song urging women to remove their headscarves said Wednesday that he was willing to pay ""a price for freedom "" after being flogged 74 times by the authorities as part of his sentence.Mehdi Yarrahi , arrested in 2023, was released last year after being convicted for his song in support of the ""Woman. Life.

Ukraine’s security dilemma amid growing Russian aggression

After the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Ukraine was left with one of the world's largest nuclear stockpiles. The third-largest nuclear power, it inherited around 5,000 nuclear weapons, including intercontinental missiles that could deliver thermonuclear warheads. After having this powerful arsenal, Ukraine took the unprecedented step of relinquishing its nuclear weapons according to the ET reports. This decision, as it determined the fate of the nation, would go on to set the stage for future conflict with Russia.The denuclearization decision of Ukraine was made on the basis of myriad considerations. Although the nation had physically possessed the weapons, it hadn't possessed the control to utilize them. Russia, possessing the launch codes and control systems, possessed control over the weapons. It rendered Ukraine's nuclear arsenal meaningless as a deterrent since they couldn't utilize them by themselves.In addition, having such a large nuclear arsenal was financially unsustainable for the newly independent state of Ukraine, which was only just stabilizing its economy. The financial burden of keeping, securing, and possibly controlling operation of the weapons was too great, and to attempt to do so would have been likely to precipitate a diplomatic crisis with Russia and the West. Geopolitical risks and economic costs dissuaded Ukraine from giving up its nuclear arsenal.In response to international pressure to proliferate nuclear weapons, in 1991 the United States launched the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program, funding and technical assistance to enable former Soviet republics to dismantle nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. International pressure to dismantle nuclear stockpiles in former Soviet republics, including Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, resulted in the creation of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program in 1991.Ukraine, despite all this, in 1994 signed the Budapest Memorandum, a significant treaty, in which the United Kingdom, Russia, and the United States guaranteed Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in return for its giving up nuclear weapons. The treaty also guaranteed that these countries would not threaten or use military action against Ukraine and would call for UN action in the case of Ukraine being threatened at any time.Whereas initially the Budapest Memorandum was welcomed as a monumental step toward global nuclear disarmament, assurances laid out in the agreement began to lose legitimacy with shifts in political loyalties. Academics had long advised, nonetheless, that the preservation of nuclear weapons by Ukraine was required to protect from probable Russian attack, since Ukraine being geopolitically situated half-way between Russia and Europe. These concerns increasingly caught momentum since Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency.Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its backing of the separatists in eastern Ukraine dispelled any illusions about the validity of the Budapest Memorandum. While the memorandum was supposed to provide guarantees, Russia's move proved that commitments by nuclear powers can be unilaterally renounced with impunity. Steven Pifer, a former US ambassador to Ukraine, said there was a two-way failure by Washington and Kyiv to anticipate the ambitions of a rising Russia.The annexation of Crimea and the war in Eastern Ukraine revealed Ukraine's weakness after it had given up its nuclear status. Russia's action proved that international security guarantees, especially those offered by nuclear powers, were not reliable in the presence of aggressive actions by a great power.With the growing Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the world observed how Ukraine's sovereignty was targeted head-on by a nuclear nation. Ukraine's countermove came in the form of requesting and accepting Western military aid. It was about high-end weapons and intel sharing, but it left more questions on larger Ukrainian security concerns. The Budapest Memorandum that had provided for protection earlier hadn't managed to deter the violence it was intended to prevent.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict illustrates the vulnerabilities of Ukrainian security in an order of the world where nuclear forces are not dependable guarantors of peace. The conflict has caused immense suffering and devastation on the human dimension, posing severe questions about Ukrainian territorial integrity and whether international assurances of security could reasonably deter future aggression.","After the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Ukraine was left with one of the world's largest nuclear stockpiles.

A return to extreme vetting?

“They vetted us, then they banned us”

Pakistan also on the list?

“Leave now” warning issued

What happens next?

A new travel ban from President Donald Trump could take effect as early as next week, potentially barring travelers from Pakistan and Afghanistan in a dramatic escalation of his immigration crackdown, as per the sources quoted by Reuters.The policy, eerily reminiscent of Trump’s controversial “Muslim ban” from his first term, is set to block thousands of Afghans who aided US forces from reaching safety, throwing their fates into uncertainty.As per reports, the new restrictions stem from an executive order Trump signed on January 20, his first day back in office. The order mandates a stricter security review of foreign nationals and demands a list of countries that allegedly pose national security risks. That list, sources say, includes Afghanistan and Pakistan, with other nations possibly being added.While the Trump administration insists the move is about security, critics call it a heartless betrayal of Afghan allies who risked their lives working alongside American forces.Among those left in limbo are over 200,000 Afghans awaiting US visas—many of them former translators, military aides, and government workers promised protection from Taliban retaliation.“Afghans who cleared resettlement screenings are already the most heavily vetted people in the world,” a US official familiar with the process was quoted as saying. “And yet, here we are, shutting the door in their faces.”Trump’s crackdown also comes amid rising Taliban violence and Islamic State insurgencies in Afghanistan, leaving many fearing that deportations or stranded visa applicants could face deadly consequences.Pakistan, a nuclear-armed nation and longtime US ally, is also expected to be included in the ban. The move is likely to inflame tensions between Washington and Islamabad, especially as Pakistan grapples with its own wave of violent extremism.With 20,000 Afghan refugees stuck in Pakistan, advocates fear a bureaucratic nightmare unfolding—stranded visa holders, families torn apart, and mounting pressure on an already overwhelmed Pakistani government.In response, Shawn VanDiver, head of the #AfghanEvac coalition, is urging visa holders to leave immediately.""Multiple sources within the US government suggest a new travel restriction could be implemented within the next week,"" he said in a statement.The official list of banned countries is expected by March 12, while Afghan resettlement efforts could be shut down by April. Trump's 90-day freeze on refugee admissions has already left thousands stranded in limbo.While legal challenges and diplomatic pushback are inevitable, for many Afghans and Pakistanis desperate to reach the US, time is running out.","A new travel ban from President Donald Trump could take effect as early as next week, potentially barring travelers from Pakistan and Afghanistan.

The internet has a new political meme star— US Vice President JD Vance . Following a tense Oval Office confrontation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 28, Vance has become the subject of viral memes, with social media users mocking his demeanor and remarks.During the high-stakes meeting, Vance aggressively challenged Zelenskyy’s request for more US funding, questioning his credibility and warning that American support might dwindle if Ukraine didn’t accept Washington’s terms. The exchange reportedly strained diplomatic ties, but it was one particular phrase that set the internet ablaze—Vance’s repeated demand: “Did you even say thank you?”Memes flooded X (formerly Twitter), with exaggerated edits of Vance as everything from an ogre to a spoiled child clutching a lollipop. Some gave him airbrushed features, plump lips, and perfectly groomed eyebrows. One widely shared post captioned, ""JD Vance’s inner diva is finally unleashed.""The fallout wasn’t just digital. As Vance vacationed in Vermont, he was met with a wave of protests from pro-Ukraine demonstrators carrying signs that read “International embarrassment” and “Vermont stands with Ukraine.” The backlash forced Vance and his family to relocate from their planned ski resort to an undisclosed location, reports say.Meanwhile, President Trump jumped into the controversy, accusing Zelenskyy of “gambling with World War III” for refusing to compromise on Ukraine’s position. The visit ultimately ended in failure for Zelenskyy, who left Washington without securing additional US aid or finalizing a minerals deal.The White House has yet to comment on the viral storm, but one thing is clear—JD Vance’s internet infamy isn’t fading anytime soon.","US Vice President JD Vance has become the subject of viral memes.

Why Was Barron Missing from the Joint Address?

Barron's Role in Politics

The Rest of the

Trump Family

Barron Trump , the youngest son of US president Donald Trump, was not present at his father's recent joint address to Congress, but the reason for his absence was a practical one, according to a report.While his siblings—Ivanka, along with her husband Jared Kushner; Don Jr., with girlfriend Bettina Anderson; Eric; and Tiffany, with her husband Michael Boulos—were in attendance at the joint meeting, accompanied by their mother, Melania Trump , Barron was notably absent, as reported by the Daily Mail.Barron, the 18-year-old freshman at New York University (NYU), had classes scheduled for the week and was therefore unable to attend the event in Washington DC, according to the Daily Mail. As a resident of Trump Tower in New York, his university experience is far from that of an ordinary student due to the 24/7 Secret Service protection he receives, the report stated.In December, his mother commented on the unique challenges he faces, saying, ""I don't think it's possible for him to be a normal student. His experience at college—it's very different from any other kid,"" as quoted by the Daily Mail.Melania, who spent most of her first month as First Lady in New York with Barron, has always been particularly protective of him, the report noted. However, she has also publicly praised the ways in which Barron has contributed to his father’s political campaigns. In January, she told Fox News that Barron had advised his father on how to reach young male voters in the 2024 election, recommending podcasts that would appeal to them, according to the Daily Mail.Keeping Barron Away from Major EventsDespite acknowledging Barron’s involvement, Melania has largely kept him away from high-profile political events, including the Republican National Convention this summer, the Daily Mail reported. Barron, who was just 10 years old when his father first took office, spent his teenage years in the White House and is now navigating adulthood.Although Barron did not attend the joint address, Melania stated that he would visit them in Washington DC. She told Fox News, ""I feel that children, when they reach 18 or 19 years old, we teach them, we guide them, and then we give them the wings to fly. I always respect Barron's yes and no—what he likes to do and where he wants to be,"" as quoted by the Daily Mail.While Barron remains somewhat out of the spotlight, his siblings continue to be active in both their personal and professional lives. Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, now living in Miami with their three children, have stepped away from politics to focus on family but remain a strong emotional support for the president, according to the report.Meanwhile, Don Jr., Eric, and Tiffany remain engaged in their own business and personal ventures. Tiffany and her husband, Michael Boulos, are expecting their first child, while Lara Trump has launched a new programme on Fox News, the Daily Mail reported.","Barron Trump, the youngest son of US president Donald Trump, was not present at his father's recent joint address to Congress.

The Canadian government has delayed its second set of retaliatory measures against US tariffs by one week, following President Donald Trump's decision to postpone levies on most Canadian and Mexican goods for a month.""As a result, Canada will not proceed with the second wave of tariffs on $125B of US products until April 2nd, while we continue to work for the removal of all tariffs,"" finance minister Dominic LeBlanc announced on X.Canada's existing 25 per cent tariff on $30 billion in U.S. goods remains active, whilst the additional tariffs on American products worth $125 billion have been rescheduled to April 2.Canada planned to implement 25% tariffs on C$155 billion ($107 billion) of American goods starting Tuesday if the US proceeds with its proposed tariffs on Canadian products.Trump signed an executive order on Thursday waiving the 25 per cent tariff on Canadian and Mexican imports under the Canada-US-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), which experts indicate covers 95 per cent of bilateral trade.The suspension, which will remain in effect until April 2, halts duties of up to 25% on these neighbouring nations. These tariffs were previously implemented under the North American trade framework earlier in the week.This decision follows a similar one-day-prior exemption granted to the automotive industry. The automotive exemption, lasting one month, was approved for vehicles moving under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) after consultations with major US automobile manufacturers Stellantis, Ford, and General Motors.Nevertheless, the White House clarified that substantial portions of Canadian and Mexican exports would continue facing tariffs. A representative indicated that about 62% of Canadian imports, predominantly energy-related goods, would still incur duties, albeit at a lower rate of 10%. Conversely, approximately half of Mexican imports, covered under the USMCA, will not face additional charges.",Canada's existing 25% tariff on $30 billion in U.S. goods remains active. The additional tariffs on American products worth $125 billion have been rescheduled to April 2.

Elon Musk denies responsibility for federal job cuts in talks with GOP lawmakers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-denies-responsibility-for-federal-job-cuts-in-talks-with-gop-lawmakers/articleshow/118772006.cms,"Trump signals caution, but backs Musk's role



Legal challenges mount as job cuts escalate



Musk’s influence rattles Washington



Some workers reinstated amid growing backlash



Democrats sound the alarm



In private discussions with Republican lawmakers this week, the billionaire tech mogul insisted that the widespread dismissals of federal employees, including veterans, were decisions made by individual agencies—not by him. His remarks come as he leads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in its mission to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal system.Musk , a close adviser to President Donald Trump, enjoys strong Republican backing for his work at DOGE. However, as job cuts ripple through communities nationwide, GOP lawmakers are facing backlash and pressing him for answers.""Elon doesn’t fire people,"" said Rep. Richard Hudson , R-N.C., after a closed-door meeting with Musk in the Capitol’s basement. ""He doesn’t have hiring and firing authority. The president's empowered him to go uncover this information, that’s it.""The Republican president weighed in on Thursday, urging agency heads to be meticulous in their decisions. ""Be very precise"" about who stays or goes, Trump posted on social media, advocating a ""scalpel rather than the hatchet"" approach.""I don’t want to see a big cut where a lot of good people are cut,"" Trump later told reporters in the Oval Office.While Trump maintained that agency leaders would lead the process, he also suggested Musk could intervene more forcefully if necessary. ""If they can cut, it’s better. And if they don’t cut, then Elon will do the cutting.""Trump also announced that Musk and Cabinet officials would meet every two weeks to advance cost-cutting initiatives.Musk’s role in reshaping the federal workforce is facing mounting legal scrutiny. Lawsuits are piling up over his aggressive push to consolidate government management and sidestep congressional authority over federal spending.One key dispute involves the White House’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which instructed agencies to fire probationary workers who lack full civil service protection. The sweeping dismissals led to abrupt staff reductions, some of which were later reversed—such as the reinstatement of workers in nuclear weapons programs.A federal judge in San Francisco raised concerns about the legality of these mass terminations, prompting the administration to shift blame to individual agencies rather than Musk or the OPM.""Some of the folks that were the probationary people, he didn’t fire them, they were actually supposedly fired by the agencies — and they messed up,"" said Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla.Asked whether Musk himself used the phrase ""they messed up,"" Gimenez clarified: ""Well, if they were in fact, you know, critical people, and the agency did the firing, then yeah, they messed up. But not him.""Musk and his team have embedded themselves deep within federal agencies, gaining access to sensitive data and challenging long-standing bureaucratic structures. Their aggressive approach has unnerved career officials, with top executives—such as those at the Social Security Administration—resigning rather than complying with Musk’s demands.The billionaire appears unfazed by the upheaval. ""We're making good progress,"" he remarked as he moved swiftly through the halls of Congress late Wednesday.Musk’s reputation as a risk-taking visionary is well established through his ventures, including SpaceX, Tesla, and social media platform X. But his leadership at DOGE represents his first direct foray into government operations—where political backlash is unavoidable.During a Senate lunch discussion, Musk was quick to distance himself from the firings.""I would say that there was an argument that that’s not coming from DOGE, it’s actually coming from individual agencies,"" said Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky.Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., went further, suggesting Musk believed some agencies mishandled the process deliberately. ""The point that he was making is that DOGE had not made recommendations for across-the-board cuts of all probationary employees at every agency,"" Barr said.Instead, he suggested that some agencies ""implemented it improperly through either incompetence or in a handful of cases actual malicious efforts to sabotage and create a public relations problem for DOGE.""Amid the fallout, some federal agencies are walking back job cuts. This week, about 180 employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were informed they could return to work. Their recall email carried an urgent subject line: ""Read this email immediately.""Musk was invited to Capitol Hill by Trump’s allies and GOP leaders to address lawmakers facing tough questions about the DOGE layoffs. With Republican lawmakers feeling the heat at town halls back home, House Speaker Mike Johnson , R-La., advised them to engage with constituents in less confrontational settings.To improve communication, Musk provided his personal phone number—to senators, but not to House members. His team is also setting up a dedicated phone line where lawmakers can raise concerns or offer input on which jobs and agencies should be spared.Democrats and advocacy groups are warning that the sweeping cuts could have devastating consequences for ordinary Americans.On Thursday, 141 House Democrats, led by Rep. Gerald Connolly of Virginia, wrote to the acting director of the OPM, urging the reinstatement of all unlawfully terminated probationary employees.""Indiscriminately firing thousands of these employees threatens the future of the nonpartisan federal workforce and our government’s ability to deliver life-saving services to the American people,"" the letter read.House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries issued a challenge to Republicans: if they want to dismantle federal agencies, they should bring it to Congress.""We welcome that fight,"" Jeffries said. ""We’ll stand on the side of the American people, and (Republicans will) continue to stand on the side of Elon Musk.""","Billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk is leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) DOGE's mission is to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal system.

As the speaker steps up to the microphone, a massive maple leaf flag ripples on the screen behind him, setting the tone for a powerful homage to the nation's spirit.Created by an anonymous group of Canadian creatives, the video sees actor Jeff Douglas reprise his iconic role as the passionate everyman, delivering a powerful tribute to Canada’s identity. Though his hair may be a little greyer, his message remains as resolute as ever: Canada will not bow to the United States.“They mistake our modesty for meekness, our kindness for consent, our nation for another star on their flag and our love of a hot cheesy poutine with their love of a hot cheesy Putin,"" Douglas declared in the video.""This is the birthplace of peanut butter and ketchup chips and yoga pants.

No. But we are not the 51st anything,"" he added.With soaring orchestral music and a surge of patriotic pride, the new version reimagines the iconic 2000 Molson Canadian ad .

The first nation of hockey! And the best part of North America! My name is Joe! And I am Canadian!""This release is particularly significant amidst growing Canada-US tensions. The video delivers a sharp rebuttal to President Donald Trump’s recent suggestion that Canada could become the 51st US state—a remark that sparked outrage among Canadians.With unwavering defiance, the ad makes its stance clear that: ""We are not 51st anything.""The updated version showcases prominent Canadians, including Terry Fox and Gordon Lightfoot, alongside Canada's response to adversity.""We are the first to unite in the crisis, the first to build bridges – not walls – and the first to stand on guard for thee,"" Douglas states in the footage, referencing the national anthem.The production concludes as a unifying message for Canadians, with Douglas expressing, ""We humbly hope it may be something that can help boost Canadian spirits.""","A new version of the iconic ""Joe Canadian"" beer commercial has been released.

Passengers aboard a Southwest flight from Houston to Phoenix were in for an unexpected show when a woman stripped naked mid-taxi, screamed at the top of her lungs, and tried to storm the cockpit in a bizarre preflight meltdown.Eyewitnesses described the scene as “completely unexpected.” The woman, initially fully clothed, suddenly walked to the front of the plane and demanded to be let off. When the crew continued taxiing, she lost control—jumping, screaming, and then stripping down to nothing.“She just started taking everything off—her hat, her shoes, everything,” one stunned passenger told 12 News.As the cabin descended into chaos, the nude flyer paced up and down the aisle, ignoring shocked passengers, including young children.

'Worse than tariffs': Jack Daniel's maker on Canada removing US alcohol from shelves,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/worse-than-tariffs-jack-daniels-maker-on-canada-removing-us-alcohol-from-shelves/articleshow/118768841.cms,"Jack Daniel’s maker Brown-Forman ’s CEO Lawson Whiting, criticised Canadian provinces for removing US alcohol from store shelves in response to President Donald Trump ’s trade policy, calling the move ""worse than a tariff"" and a ""disproportionate response"" to the administration’s levies.In response to US tariffs on Canadian goods, several Canadian provinces, notably Ontario, the most populous, implemented countermeasures this week. Earlier on Tuesday, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario ( LCBO ), a major global alcohol purchaser, removed US-made alcoholic drinks including Jack Daniel’s from its shelves.The CEO of Brown-Forman, Lawson Whiting, criticised the Canadian reaction as ""disproportionate"" compared to the Trump administration's 25% duties on Canadian products.""I mean, that's worse than a tariff, because it's literally taking your sales away, completely removing our products from the shelves,"" Whiting said, BBC reported.Canada has imposed 25% levies on US imports, including beer, spirits, and wine in retaliation to the tariffs. Additionally, some provinces, such as Ontario and Nova Scotia, have implemented their own measures.Ontario's Premier Doug Ford announced that the LCBO's annual US alcohol sales of nearly $1 billion would cease immediately, adding that: ""As of today, every single one of these products is off the shelves.""As the exclusive Ontario wholesaler, the LCBO's decision means provincial retailers, bars and restaurants cannot replenish US products, Ford added.Whiting noted that Canadian operations represented merely 1% of total sales, making the impact manageable. However, he expressed concern about Mexico, which contributed 7% of 2024 sales, according to its annual report.Brown-Forman shares fell more than 3% on Thursday, despite being up about 8% earlier after the company reaffirmed its annual forecasts, factoring in the impact of tariffs.Despite acknowledging ""continued uncertainty and headwinds in the external environment"", Whiting expressed confidence in the company's direction.The LCBO is encouraging Canadians to support locally made products, with some already opting for domestic goods in response to Trump's tariffs.Brown-Forman has been grappling with weakening demand this year, particularly in the US, Canada, and Europe. However, growth in emerging markets like Mexico and Poland has helped offset some of the decline.To navigate a more challenging market, the company has implemented cost-cutting measures, including workforce reductions. Analysts suggest these moves reflect broader difficulties facing both Brown-Forman and the spirits industry as a whole.","Jack Daniel’s maker Brown-Forman ’s CEO Lawson Whiting, criticised Canadian provinces for removing US alcohol from store shelves.

"Is Gavin Newsom shifting right? Calls trans athletes in women’s sports 'deeply unfair,' says Democrats ‘weaponized’ issue",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-gavin-newsom-shifting-right-calls-trans-athletes-in-womens-sports-deeply-unfair-says-democrats-weaponized-issue/articleshow/118765940.cms,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom (AP)

A calculated move for 2028?

Cracks in the Democratic narrative?

He rejected the term “Latinx”

He called defunding the police “lunacy”

He criticized “cancel culture”

He admitted private doubts from Democratic friends about trans inclusion in sports

The takeaway: Is Newsom pivoting right?

California Governor Gavin Newsom , once a trailblazer for LGBTQ+ rights, made a surprising admission: Democrats are losing the battle on transgender athletes in women’s sports.During the first episode of his new podcast This Is Gavin Newsom, the governor told conservative activist Charlie Kirk that the issue was “deeply unfair” and that his party was taking a serious political hit.“We’re getting crushed on it. Crushed. Crushed,” Newsom said, acknowledging the growing backlash.This is a stark shift for Newsom, who famously defied his own party two decades ago by issuing same-sex marriage licenses in San Francisco. Now, he’s signaling that Democrats may have miscalculated on trans athletes, particularly in youth and college sports.Newsom’s strategic shift comes as he positions himself for a potential 2028 presidential run . He was surprisingly open with Kirk, even praising a Trump campaign attack ad that used Vice President Kamala Harris' past support for taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for detained immigrants against her.“She didn’t even react to it, which was even more devastating,” Newsom noted, calling the ad “brutal” and “great”—a statement few Democrats would dare to make.While Newsom reaffirmed his commitment to LGBTQ+ rights, he also distanced himself from progressive talking points:His biggest break came when he discussed AB Hernandez, a transgender high school track star whose victory in California has fueled conservative outrage. When pressed by Kirk, Newsom didn’t defend the policy but instead admitted:“The issue of fairness is completely legit.”Newsom’s tone shift on trans issues, crime, and progressive culture wars suggests a calculated repositioning—one that could set him apart in a future Democratic primary. While he stopped short of calling for bans, his willingness to agree with MAGA-world influencers shows a more pragmatic, centrist-friendly approach.Could this be the beginning of a Democratic shift on trans athletes? Newsom’s words suggest he’s reading the political winds—and they’re not blowing left.","California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Democrats are losing the battle on transgender athletes in women’s sports.

Pakistan has been ranked as the second-most terrorism-affected country in the world, moving up from its previous fourth position, according to the Global Terrorism Index (GTI) 2025 report.The report, published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), highlights a worrying increase in terrorist activity in the country, with deaths from terrorism surging by 45 per cent in 2024.Fatalities rose from 748 in 2023 to 1,081 in 2024, one of the sharpest increases globally,reported.The number of terrorist attacks also more than doubled, rising from 517 in 2023 to 1,099 in 2024. This marked the first time since the GTI’s inception that attacks exceeded 1,000 in a single year. The report links this surge to the growing influence of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has exploited the situation in Afghanistan since the Taliban's return to power.The TTP remained the deadliest terrorist group in Pakistan, accounting for 52 per cent of all terrorism-related deaths.The group carried out 482 attacks in 2024, resulting in 558 deaths—a 90 per cent increase from the previous year. The GTI report stated, ""Since the Afghan Taliban took control in 2021, TTP has expanded its operations by using safe havens across the border, allowing it to launch attacks with greater ease.""Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, both bordering Afghanistan, remained the worst-hit regions, experiencing over 96 per cent of all terrorist incidents in Pakistan. The deadliest attack of 2024 was a suicide bombing at Quetta railway station, carried out by the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), killing at least 25 people, including civilians and soldiers.Attacks by BLA and similar groups surged from 116 in 2023 to 504 in 2024, with deaths rising from 88 to 388.The GTI report also places Pakistan’s terrorism crisis in a global context, noting that terrorism-related deaths worldwide increased by 11 per cent in 2024.Burkina Faso, Pakistan, and Syria recorded the highest number of deaths from terrorism. The Sahel region remained the epicentre of terrorism, accounting for over half of all global fatalities.The Islamic State (IS) remained the deadliest terrorist organisation, responsible for 1,805 deaths, primarily in Syria and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).The report also highlighted the changing nature of terrorism, particularly in the West, where ""lone wolf"" attacks accounted for 93 per cent of fatal incidents over the past five years. Social media, gaming platforms, and encrypted messaging apps have played a significant role in radicalisation.The Israel-Gaza conflict has further fuelled global tensions, leading to a rise in antisemitic and Islamophobic hate crimes, particularly in the US and Europe.Steve Killelea, founder and executive chairman of the IEP, noted that the world is witnessing an increase in both traditional and emerging threats.He stated, ""This year’s Global Terrorism Index highlights two key concerns, firstly, 98 per cent of all terrorist deaths occurred in conflict zones, with 2024 recording the highest number of conflicts since World War II. Secondly, social tensions and dissatisfaction within the West are fuelling lone actor terrorism.""","Pakistan has been ranked as the second-most terrorism-affected country in the world, moving up from its previous fourth position.

Taliban-linked outfit claims dozens of Pakistan soldiers killed in cantonment attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/taliban-linked-outfit-claims-dozens-of-pakistan-soldiers-killed-in-cantonment-attack/articleshow/118743228.cms,"Photo/ANI

ISLAMABAD: Anguished cries of mourners preparing to bury their dead pierced an uneasy calm in Bannu cantonment of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Wednesday, a day after 13 civilians and five soldiers were killed in a burst of mayhem caused by militants ramming two explosives-laden vehicles into a wall of the army compound.Seven of the civilian casualties in the violence late Tuesday were children while five were women. Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack and declared that dozens of soldiers were killed.The army said its prompt response to the militant incursion into the cantonment city helped thwart what could have been a suicide attack with far more devastating consequences. All 16 militants involved in the raid were killed, taking the casualties to 34, the military's media wing said.Schools and shops in Bannu city didn't open the morning after and remained shut throughout the day, reflecting that gloom that descended in the area, adjacent to the restive North Waziristan tribal district bordering Afghanistan. This was the second militant attack on the cantonment within a year and the third within Pakistan since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan last Sunday.In a statement shared on social media, Jaish al-Fursan said the blasts were triggered through explosives-laden vehicles.Official sources said the militant raiders blew up the vehicles at the gate after they were intercepted by security personnel stationed at the entrance. The attack started at 6.30pm, minutes after iftar (break in fasting), and was followed by an unspecified number of militants trying to infiltrate the camp. This resulted in a gunfight that continued till the last of the militants were killed.Over a dozen people were buried in the debris of walls and roofs of multiple houses destroyed by the explosions. A mosque next to the cantonment's entrance also collapsed, trapping a number of worshippers in the rubble. They were pulled out of the debris after the fighting ended.A few days earlier, a suicide bomber killed six people at an Islamic religious school in Akora Khattak town of the same province. Several Taliban leaders graduated from this school, infamous as the ""university of jihad"".Last year was the deadliest in a decade for Pakistan, with a surge in attacks in which over 1,600 lives were lost, according to official data.Islamabad accuses Kabul of failing to root out fighters sheltering on its soil and preparing to mount assaults on Pakistan, a charge the Taliban govt stoutly denies.Jaish al-Fursan is headed by Hafiz Gul Bahadur, a commander of what used to be regarded as the ""good Taliban"".","Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack.

ISLAMABAD: US President Donald Trump's announcement to Congress late Tuesday about the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla – mastermind of the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing outside Kabul airport that killed 13 American military service personnel and 170-odd Afghans – came with a surprise pat on Pakistan's back for its role in the operation.""Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,"" Trump said in his first address to Congress since returning to the White House for a second term.""I want to thank especially the govt of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he said of the prolonged search culminating in forces tracing Sharifulla to a hideout on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.According to US media reports, CIA and Pakistani intelligence worked closely to find Sharifulla, whom Pakistan described as a ""top-tier operational commander"" of the proscribed Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP).

The big picture



Renewed counterterrorism cooperation: A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan.

A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan. Regional security concerns: The Islamic State Khorasan, IS’s regional affiliate, has been linked to several high-profile international attacks, including the March 2024 Moscow concert hall bombing that killed over 140 people and the deadly attack in Iran last year. The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations.

The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations. Pakistan’s domestic threats: IS-K has expanded its reach beyond Afghanistan, increasingly targeting Pakistani cities and security forces. Meanwhile, the TTP has launched numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan’s tribal regions. The government has struggled to contain these threats, making counterterrorism cooperation with the US a strategic necessity.

Between the lines



What’s next



US-Pakistan relations: If this counterterrorism cooperation continues, it could lead to a thaw in relations between the two countries, potentially reviving security assistance programs that had been cut in recent years. The US may also push Pakistan to do more against militant safe havens within its borders.

The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP. Broader implications for Afghanistan: This arrest further highlights Afghanistan’s growing role as a sanctuary for international terrorist networks. The Taliban’s ability (or unwillingness) to suppress IS-K will be a key issue for regional stability.

Pakistani security forces played a crucial role in capturing Mohammad Sharifullah , a top commander of the Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), who was allegedly responsible for the devastating suicide bombing outside Kabul airport in August 2021. The attack, which occurred during the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, killed 13 US service members and 170 Afghan civilians.President Donald Trump, in his first address to Congress since his return to the White House, announced that Pakistan had helped arrest “the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity.” While he did not provide details about the operation, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later confirmed that Sharifullah was apprehended in a counterterrorism raid along the Pakistan-Afghan border.Pakistan’s involvement in this high-profile counterterrorism operation could significantly reshape its relationship with the US.By assisting in Sharifullah’s arrest, Pakistan is signaling its willingness to re-engage with Washington on security matters.This move comes as Pakistan faces increasing pressure from militant groups, including IS-K and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which have intensified attacks within the country.The operation could help Islamabad gain favor with the US, potentially unlocking military and economic assistance at a time when Pakistan is grappling with financial instability.Pakistan’s decision to assist in Sharifullah’s arrest is not just about counterterrorism—it is also about geopolitics. The country’s strategic importance has waned since the US and Nato withdrawal from Afghanistan, but this operation could help Islamabad regain relevance in Washington’s security calculus.South Asia expert Michael Kugelman noted that Pakistan is trying to “leverage US concerns about terror in Afghanistan and pitch a renewed security partnership.”At the same time, Pakistan’s cooperation might be seen as a balancing act. Islamabad has maintained complex ties with the Afghan Taliban, and it remains to be seen how Kabul will react to this development.The US justice department has charged Sharifullah with ""providing and conspiring to provide material support and resources"" to the group.""He confessed. This was the planner of that bombing,"" White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said in an interview with Fox News.FBI director Kash Patel said Sharifullah was in US custody, in a post on X alongside a picture of agents standing in front of the plane that he was due to arrive on.""That time you delivered the sword of justice for the American people- thank you for your incredible leadership @AGPamBondi and @JohnRatcliffe.

'English in taste'

'Language of learning'

""Dram"", meaning a measure of whisky. ""Turm"", describing a cavalry unit. ""Taupie"", a foolish youngster.Not words in a typical teen's vocabulary, but all come easily to Pakistani prodigy Bilal Asher , world under-14 Scrabble champion.Despite a musty reputation, the word-spelling game has a cult youth following in Pakistan, a legacy of the English languageimposed by Britain's empire but which the country has adapted into its own dialect since independence.In the eccentric field of competitive Scrabble, Pakistan's youngsters reign supreme -- boasting the current youth world champion and more past victors than any other nation since the tournament debuted in 2006.""It requires a lot of hard work and determination,"" said 13-year-old Asher after vanquishing a grey-bearded opponent.""You have to trust the process for a very long time, and then gradually it will show the results.""Karachi, a megacity shrugging off its old definition as a den of violent crime, is Pakistan's incubator for talent in Scrabble -- where players spell words linked like a crossword with random lettered tiles.Schools in the southern port metropolis organise tutorials with professional Scrabble coaches and grant scholarships to top players, while parents push their kids to become virtuosos.""They inculcate you in this game,"" said Asher, one of around 100 players thronging a hotel function room for a Pakistan Scrabble Association (PSA) event as most of the city dozed through a Sunday morning.Daunters (meaning intimidating people), imarets (inns for pilgrims) and trienes (chemical compounds containing three double bonds) are spelled out by ranks of seated opponents.Some are so young their feet don't touch the ground, as they use chess clocks to time their turns.""They're so interested because the parents are interested,"" said 16-year-old Affan Salman, who became the world youth Scrabble champion in Sri Lanka last year.""They want their children to do productive things -- Scrabble is a productive game.""English was foisted onthe Indian subcontinent by Britain's colonialism and an 1835 order from London started to systematise it as the main language of education.The plan's architect, Thomas Macaulay, said the aim was to produce ""a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect.""It was instrumental in creating a colonial civil service to rule for Britain according to Kaleem Raza Khan, who teaches English at Karachi's Salim Habib University.""They started teaching English because they wanted to create a class of people, Indian people, who would be in the middle of the people and the rulers,"" said Khan, whose wife and daughter are Scrabble devotees.British rule ended in the bloody partition of 1947 creating India and Pakistan.Today there are upwards of 70 languages spoken in Pakistan, but English remains an official state language alongside the lingua franca Urdu, and they mingle in daily usage.Schools often still teach English with verbose colonial-era textbooks.""The adaptation of English as the main language is definitely a relation to the colonial era,"" said PSA youth programme director Tariq Pervez. ""That is our main link.""The English of Pakistani officialdom remains steeped in anachronistic words.The prime minister describes militant attacks as ""dastardly"", state media dubs protesters ""miscreants"" and the military denounces its ""nefarious"" adversaries.Becoming fluent in the loquacious lingo of Pakistani English remains aspirational because of its association to the upper echelons of society.In Pakistan more than a third of children between the ages of five and 16 are out of school -- a total of nearly 26 million, according to the 2023 census.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared an ""education emergency"" last year to address the stark figures.""People are interested in Scrabble because they can get opportunities for scholarships in universities or for jobs because it provides the vocab,"" said Asher's sister Manaal.But the 14-year-old reigning female number one in Pakistan warned: ""You've got to be resilient otherwise Scrabble isn't right for you.""In the Karachi hotel, Scrabble -- invented in the 1930s during America's Great Depression by an unemployed architect -- is an informal training programme for success in later life.""The main language of learning is English,"" said Pervez.""This game has a great pull,"" he added. ""The demand is so big. So many kids want to play, we don't have enough resources to accommodate all of them.""At the youngest level the vocabulary of the players is more rudimentary: toy, tiger, jar, oink.But professional Scrabble coach Waseem Khatri earns 250,000 rupees ($880) a month -- nearly seven times the minimum wage -- coaching some 6,000 students across Karachi's school system to up their game.In Pakistani English parlance ""they try to express things in a more beautiful way -- in a long way to express their feelings,"" said 36-year-old Khatri.""We try to utilise those words also in Scrabble.""But when Asher wins he is overwhelmed with joy, and those long words don't come so easily.""I cannot describe the feeling,"" he said.",Pakistani youngsters reign supreme in the eccentric field of competitive Scrabble.

Talks start on Pakistan’s $7 billion IMF bailout review,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/talks-start-on-pakistans-7billion-imf-bailout-review/articleshow/118717323.cms,"IMF

ISLAMABAD: Formal talks between cash-strapped Pakistan and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) for the first biannual review of a $7-billion bailout programme kicked off Tuesday in Islamabad.Pakistan and IMF had reached a three-year $7 billion aid package deal in July, with the new programme set to allow the country to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”. As part of the deal, Islamabad had agreed to a number of unpopular measures, including increasing the amount of tax it collects from people and businesses.A nine-member team led by IMF mission chief Nathan Porter had landed in Pakistan on Monday to assess the country’s economic performance to determine the release of a $1.1-billion tranche. “They are here. We will have two rounds of talks, first technical and then policy level. I think we are well-positioned for the talks,” finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said.During their discussions with Pakistani authorities, the IMF delegation will assess the country’s compliance with quantitative performance criteria, structural benchmarks and indicative targets under the 37-month programme.A senior govt official involved in preparations for the IMF review said there were some technical slippages for certain deadlines. The most critical weakness observed so far had been the revenue shortfall against programme targets, the official added.The ongoing 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme consists of six reviews over the life of the bailout, and the release of the next tranche of approximately $1bn will be contingent on the success of the performance review.Just before the mission’s visit, IMF reiterated last week that its programme aimed to raise Pakistan’s woefully low tax-to-GDP ratio by 3%, while improving the fairness and efficiency of the tax system by broadening the tax base and improving tax compliance.According to media reports, IMF has been demanding action against tax evasion in the real estate sector. “During the ongoing talks, the IMF pushed for action against those misdeclaring property values,” a local TV station reported, saying the government had assured the global lender it would activate the Real Estate Regulatory Authority.Pakistan has taken more than 20 loans from the IMF since 1958 and is currently its fifth-largest debtor. For decades, the country has relied on IMF loans to meet its needs and continued to struggle after years of financial mismanagement.In 2023, Pakistan was on the verge of defaulting on its debts and had barely enough in foreign currencies to pay for a month of imports.","Pakistan and IMF had reached a three-year $7 billion aid package deal in July.

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar. Following his father’s assassination in 2018, he also became chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) political party. He had also previously served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007.Haq was also among the few who called on the world and Pakistan to immediately recognise the Taliban govt and establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul in 2021.Last year, he led a delegation of religious scholars to Afghanistan for “religious diplomacy” meetings with Taliban leaders.His seminary had faced controversy in the past as its students were accused of involvement in the assassination of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. The madrasa, however, denied any connection with the suspects.","At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque.

Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was alos present during the ceremony.According to a statement by CMSA, both nations will collaborate on selecting and training Pakistani astronauts, with the chosen candidate expected to join Chinese taikonauts for a short-term mission in the coming years.""This signifies a major step in China’s international space cooperation ,"" reported Global Times, highlighting the growing partnership between Beijing and Islamabad in aerospace advancements.China’s space station, which has been operational for nearly four years, was built after the country was reportedly excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns over the involvement of China’s military in its space programme.The station is also seen as a new frontier of competition between China and the US.As per the news agency PTI, the agreement further solidifies China’s support for Pakistan’s space ambitions, following previous collaborations such as the launch of Pakistani satellites.Pakistan’s first digital communications satellite, Badr-1, was launched aboard a Chinese Long March 2E rocket in 1990, while earlier this year, Pakistan’s CubeSat accompanied China’s Chang’e-6 probe to the Moon.According to Global Times, the selection of the astronaut is expected to take around a year, after which the candidate will undergo intensive training in China. This move, experts say, demonstrates the reliability of China's manned space technology and its willingness to lower barriers for developing countries to participate in space exploration .China has also set ambitious goals for space exploration, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon before 2030.Meanwhile, the US has its sights set on returning to the lunar surface by 2025.","China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong.

Candace Owens alleges that Erika Kirk orchestrated TPUSA livestream drama





The heated clash between conservative commentator Candace Owens and Turning Point USA has taken an unexpected turn, with Owens now aiming her criticism directly at Erika Kirk, the widow of the late TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk . What began as a disagreement over scheduling a livestream to address Owens’ allegations about Kirk’s killing has now spilled into a conversation about leadership, transparency, and who is truly calling the shots at TPUSA.Owens insists she never backed out of speaking publicly, but claims the organization attempted to control the narrative by changing terms at the last minute and refusing to let her join virtually. Now she’s questioning Erika Kirk’s role in it all.The dispute escalated after TPUSA member Blake Neff claimed Owens declined their invitation to speak live on The Charlie Kirk Show. Neff argued the group was not “booking a guest” but simply offering Owens a chance to respond to accusations against her.Owens countered by saying TPUSA changed the conditions after she agreed, demanding she appear in person in Phoenix at a time that clashed with her own podcast. She maintains she was misled about both timing and format.She later announced that if TPUSA insisted on speaking during her regular streaming slot, she would not back down, writing, “It has been decided by the public that the best response for this is for my team to livestream your livestream and provide commentary.”Owens insisted she had never refused to speak, only refused to play by new rules imposed without discussion.Then came the statement that shocked many: Owens accused Erika Kirk of directing TPUSA to set up the livestream and push the confrontation forward. On her podcast and on X, Owens wrote, “TPUSA says it was Erika Kirk who directed them to host a livestream. Did she approve of the letter Blake read?” The question implied not only involvement, but responsibility for a message Owens considers misleading.Erika Kirk, now CEO of TPUSA, has not issued a response. With Owens continuing to suggest the organization betrayed Charlie Kirk’s legacy, the conservative movement finds itself facing a very public divide and neither side appears ready to back down.Also Read: Candace Owens accuses TPUSA of playing games with livestream invite, says the group hasn’t felt “sincere” since Charlie’s death","Conservative commentator Candace Owens has escalated her dispute with Turning Point USA, now targeting Erika Kirk.

George Farmer and Candace Owens: how they met





Candace Owens’ husband is George Farmer, a British-American businessman and the former CEO of Parler. The couple married in 2019 and have four children. George Farmer is also the son of Lord Michael Farmer from the U.K. House of Lords. He is known for staying mostly private, but Owens often says he is a strong part of her team at home and at work.Candace Owens spoke openly about her husband after she said she could not travel to Phoenix for a Turning Point USA show. She told viewers she would even “beg” the “Supreme Court,” her joke name for her husband, to allow an in-person show if Erika Kirk is there and if she can bring her team and show her “timelines.” Candace Owens said, “My husband is very much a part of my team…”She also shared that she could not attend the show because “my husband instantly said, ‘No, you cannot do this Monday.’” She explained that he “runs the household” and had an important event the same day with people coming “from overseas.” These quotes made many people ask about her husband and why he has such a big role in her work life.Candace Owens shared when talking about the TPUSA show:“If you’re saying that I don’t have to deal with you and this is actually going to be very open and I can ask every question under the sun… I might beg … I want to make this happen … Let’s make this work for the people.”And then she explained why she could not attend the TPUSA show on the given dates:“Even if I could have made it work, which I couldn’t have because my husband instantly said, ‘No, you cannot do this Monday.’ He runs the household and he has an important thing going on that day, which involves people that are coming in from overseas.”These quotes, shared by Collin Rugg on X, show how involved George Farmer is in Candace Owens’ decisions.George Farmer is known for business, but in Candace Owens’ words, he is also the person who helps her plan her work, travel, and shows.She calls him her “Supreme Court,” a sign of how much she trusts him. Their bond shapes her schedule, her public moments, and many choices she makes.Candace Owens met George Farmer in December 2018 at a dinner in London. They got engaged only 17 days later. Their wedding took place in August 2019 at the Trump Winery in Virginia. Candace Owens has said many times that Farmer is a steady support for her.Their family now includes four children, and both often speak about their faith and simple home life. As Owens said again in her new comments, “My husband is very much a part of my team.”There was also growing attention because of recent public arguments and online debates. In moments like this, George Farmer’s name comes up because Candace Owens explains her choices by sharing how he guides her decisions.Also Read: “Come On My Show Tomorrow”: Candace Owens Hits Nick Fuentes With Receipts After He Slams Her Over TPUSA Livestream Date","Candace Owens’ husband is George Farmer, a British-American businessman and the former CEO of Parler.

Judge rejects plea for house arrest as 6ix9ine’s violations stack up





Tekashi 6ix9ine is headed back behind bars, marking yet another chapter in a legal saga that has followed him since his infamous racketeering case. The rapper, whose real name is Daniel Hernandez, has been sentenced to three months in prison after a judge ruled that he violated the terms of his supervised release.The decision comes after prosecutors argued that his repeated run-ins with the law showed a disregard for the conditions set when he gained early release in 2020. Despite pleas from his legal team that jail time would put him at higher risk due to his status as a cooperating witness, the court refused to grant him house arrest.According to ABC News and Billboard, prosecutors were initially pushing for a sentence of three to nine months, citing multiple offenses since 6ix9ine began his supervised release. His violations date back to November 2024 when he admitted to using drugs and traveling to Las Vegas without authorization. He served 45 days in jail for that offense and received an additional year of supervision. But trouble continued to follow him.By February, he was caught with cocaine and MDMA. Months later, he was involved in an assault at a Florida mall, further complicating his legal probation. These back-to-back incidents strengthened the prosecution’s argument that he continually disregarded court orders.Despite the repeated violations, 6ix9ine’s attorney, Lance Lazzaro, maintained that incarceration would have a disproportionate impact on his client. Lazzaro wrote that due to Hernandez’s cooperation in the 2018 racketeering case, where he testified against members of the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods, his safety requires strict isolation whenever he is jailed.This means harsher conditions compared to standard inmates. “Due to Mr. Hernandez’ classification, he always serves his jail time segregated and fully isolated from other inmates,” he stated, adding that isolation leads to “very little time outside to get fresh air and exercise.”The court was unmoved, and 6ix9ine is expected to report to prison on January 6, 2026. For a rapper who built a career on controversy, this sentence serves as another reminder that legal consequences continue long after headlines fade.Also Read: “Get shot on stream”: Asmongold fears Twitch could face a deadly crisis if ‘nuisance streamers’ continue to thrive","Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine, real name Daniel Hernandez, faces three months in jail for violating supervised release terms.

Candace Owens Explodes; Claims Tpusa Staffer Hid Charlie Kirk’s ‘Death Text’

Candace Owens says TPUSA changed the rules and then blamed her for refusing to appear





The tension between Candace Owens and Turning Point USA continues to build, and her latest comments suggest this is about more than politics or personality clashes. Owens is calling out the organization for what she sees as misleading behavior surrounding a livestream they invited her to join.What might seem like a simple scheduling issue has turned into a bigger conversation about trust and transparency inside TPUSA since the death of Charlie Kirk. Owens’ frustration is clear, and her latest post makes it sound like she believes something has changed within the group and not for the better.The back-and-forth started when TPUSA’s Blake Neff shared a post claiming Owens declined their offer to join a livestream conversation. Neff wrote, “She was given the opportunity to join and declined.” But Owens says that version of the story leaves out important details.According to her, the original offer didn’t demand an immediate response or an in-person appearance. She explained, “You literally said ‘we would SINCERELY welcome her participation in that livestream’ which you were clear your team would be streaming from your studio in Phoenix at a date that had not been decided.”Owens says the invitation suddenly shifted into strict requirements she never agreed to. “You never said, ‘she MUST be in-person for the stream and she MUST respond within 24 hours after we choose a date and time.’”What frustrates her most is what she sees as dishonesty in how TPUSA publicly presented the situation. She wrote, “There was nothing sincere about what you did following that announcement and you deserve the ratio you’re getting.”Owens then added something more personal: “Frankly, nothing has felt sincere about the organization since Charlie passed.”Her words cut deeper than a simple disagreement over logistics, suggesting grief, confusion, and trust issues are playing out in real time. This doesn’t look like a fight either side plans to end quietly.Also Read: Blake Neff rejects Candace Owens’ offer to join Charlie Kirk's TPUSA livestream virtually, pushes forward with Kirk livestream alone","Candace Owens publicly accused Turning Point USA of misleading behavior regarding a livestream invitation.

Charlie Kirk Assassination Theory Rocks MAGA; Candace Owens Drops Bombshell

Perez Hilton challenges Erika Kirk’s comments on gun violence

Erika Kirk opens up about forgiving Charlie Kirk’s assassination

Erika Kirk named new CEO of TPUSA after the Charlie Kirk assassination





Perez Hilton gave a strong reaction after Erika Kirk, the wife of Charlie Kirk, said that America does not have a “gun problem,” even though her husband was shot and killed in public. Erika Kirk spoke at The New York Times DealBook Summit on December 3 with host Andrew Ross Sorkin. The event was streamed live. During the talk, Sorkin asked her about gun violence in America. He also reminded viewers that Charlie Kirk always supported the Second Amendment.Erika Kirk said she still believes guns are not the real issue. She said the bigger problem is people who choose violence. Her answer became a major talking point. On December 4, Perez Hilton wrote about this in his blog and disagreed with her view. He said gun safety is about simple steps that save lives. He also said people can care about both mental health and gun safety at the same time.During the interview, Erika Kirk shared memories about her late husband and spoke about the day he died. When Sorkin asked her about gun violence, she said the problem was not guns. She said it was a human problem and a mental problem. Erika Kirk said:“What I’ve realized through all of this is that you can have individuals that will always resort to violence.And what I’m afraid of is that we are living in a day and age where they think violence is the solution to them not wanting to hear a different point of view. That’s not a gun problem, that’s a human, deeply human, problem. That is a soul problem, that is a mental, that is a very deeper issue.”Perez Hilton quoted her words and then pushed back on her view. He wrote that he was not shocked by her statement “given her beliefs.” But he also explained why he disagreed. In his blog, he said:“It’s about saving as many lives as possible, and it’s not about taking guns away. It’s about safety and common sense. Prevention, people! Prevention matters, and you can care about both the mental health problems AND gun safety. They are not mutually exclusive.”He said the goal of the gun safety movement is to lower the chance of such shootings.Later in the talk, Erika Kirk spoke about the moment she publicly forgave the man who killed her husband. She first shared this message at Charlie Kirk’s memorial. She said she did not plan that part of the speech. She said:“That part I specifically left open. If you look at my speech notes, that part I prayed on so heavily beforehand, and that was a game-time, exact second-to-second moment. That was not something pre-planned. That was not because I’m not going to say something I don’t truly believe.”She also said:“And when I prayed on it, I knew that the Lord would really press it on my heart. And if I was meant to say it because I truly meant it and believed it, then I was going to say it. But I was not going to pre-plan that.”She added that forgiveness did not mean she thought the act was okay. She said her husband also believed in forgiveness.A few days after Charlie Kirk’s assassination, TPUSA’s board voted for Erika Kirk to become the new CEO. She said her husband always wanted young people to talk openly about mental health. She said he pushed these talks at college events.Before the DealBook interview, Erika Kirk also spoke with Megyn Kelly, where she shared more memories of her husband.Also Read: “Come on my show tomorrow”: Candace Owens hits Nick Fuentes with receipts after he slams her over TPUSA livestream date",Erika Kirk said she still believes guns are not the real issue.

Planning your year around UAE holidays





Local authorities may add extra holidays

Public holidays are not carried forward if they fall on weekends or overlap with another holiday

Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, so slight adjustments are possible





Residents of the UAE have much to look forward to in 2026, with several public holidays promising opportunities for long weekends and family time. From Eid celebrations to the National Day, a mix of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar holidays will shape the holiday calendar. Here is a detailed guide to all predicted public holidays, how they are determined, and tips to plan your time off.UAE public holidays are a combination of fixed Gregorian dates and Islamic lunar calendar dates. Gregorian holidays, such as New Year’s Day and National Day, occur on the same date each year. Islamic holidays, including Eid Al Fitr, Eid Al Adha, Islamic New Year, and Prophet Muhammad’s Birthday (PBUH), shift each year based on moon sightings.The UAE Public Holiday Law, established in April 2024 and implemented from January 2025, allows certain holidays to be shifted to the start or end of the week to create long weekends, except for Eid holidays. Cabinet Resolution No. 27 of 2024 also permits local governments to declare additional holidays for special occasions.Holidays that fall on weekends or coincide with another public holiday are not carried forward, but 2026 predictions indicate no overlap between Islamic holidays and Gregorian holidays.Residents in the UAE can expect at least 12 public holidays in 2026. While final dates depend on moon sightings and government announcements, current predictions give a clear picture of the likely schedule:Transferable holidays: Islamic holidays such as Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al Adha are not transferable. Other holidays, including the Islamic New Year, Prophet’s Birthday, and National Day, may be moved to create long weekends based on Cabinet resolutions.2026 promises several opportunities for extended breaks:Residents are advised to plan ahead, as Islamic holidays depend on moon sightings, which may adjust official dates.Public and private schools in the UAE align their breaks with national holidays, though exact dates differ by curriculum and school authority:This schedule helps families coordinate holidays and make the most of predicted long weekends.Understanding the mix of fixed and lunar based holidays allows residents to strategically plan annual leave. For example, taking just a few days off around Eid or National Day can maximize time away from work. While the UAE government confirms official dates closer to each holiday, these predictions serve as a reliable guide for 2026.Residents should note:With this guide, UAE residents can look forward to a year of well timed breaks, long weekends, and ample family and leisure time.","UAE residents in 2026 can enjoy 12 public holidays, including Eid, National Day, and school breaks.

Indian student’s honest UK student journey: Expectations vs Reality

Which universities have halted or paused recruitment?





A growing list of institutions has already moved to protect their compliance status:

University of Chester has suspended recruitment from Pakistan until autumn 2026, citing an unexpected rise in visa refusals.

has suspended recruitment from Pakistan until autumn 2026, citing an unexpected rise in visa refusals. University of Wolverhampton is no longer taking undergraduate applicants from Pakistan and Bangladesh.

University of East London , Coventry, Sunderland and others have temporarily stopped recruitment from one or both countries.

, Coventry, Sunderland and others have temporarily stopped recruitment from one or both countries. University of Hertfordshire — under a Home Office-mandated action plan — has paused recruitment from both countries until 2026.

Oxford Brookes has paused undergraduate recruitment from Pakistan and Bangladesh for its January 2026 intake.

London Metropolitan University has stopped recruitment from Bangladesh entirely, saying the country accounted for 60 per cent of its visa refusals.

BPP University has temporarily paused recruitment from Pakistan as a risk-mitigation measure.

1. Higher scrutiny from the Home Office





2. Sharp rise in asylum claims





3. Uneven quality of overseas recruitment





How is this affecting students in Pakistan and Bangladesh?





Offers are being withdrawn late in the process

Applications are being paused or left in limbo

Some students have paid deposits they cannot recover

Many who were preparing to travel in January or spring 2026 now have no clear pathway

Why are universities so worried?





Tens of millions in lost tuition revenue

Layoffs and course closures

An irreversible reputational hit

Inability to recruit for key postgraduate programmes

What changes are universities making?





Increasing deposit requirements

Tightening financial documentation checks

Re-evaluating all partnerships with overseas agents

Diversifying recruitment to other markets

Introducing stricter pre-CAS interviews

Reducing exposure to any country with a high refusal risk

What does this mean for migration policy?





The bottom line









The irony is sharp. For years, British universities depended on international students to keep their books balanced and their campuses global. Now many of those same institutions are quietly shutting their doors to two of their biggest applicant pools. The sector insists this is about compliance, not discrimination, but the effect is unmistakable: students from Pakistan and Bangladesh are being blocked, deferred or dropped because universities fear breaching tougher Home Office rules.Here is the full breakdown.Several UK universities have stopped accepting new applications from Pakistan and Bangladesh after tighter Home Office rules made it riskier to sponsor students from countries with high visa refusal rates.The trigger is the overhaul of the Basic Compliance Assessment, the framework universities must meet to retain their student sponsor licence. Under the updated rules, no more than 5 per cent of an institution’s sponsored visa applications can be refused. The previous limit was 10 per cent.Pakistan and Bangladesh now sit well above the new threshold. Their refusal rates — roughly 18 per cent for Pakistan and 22 per cent for Bangladesh in the year to September 2025 — put universities at risk of sanctions, including losing their ability to enrol international students altogether.For many mid-tier and lower-fee institutions, that is an existential threat.Some institutions have reinstated certain programmes for the January intake, but most remain cautious.Why are refusal rates so high?Three major trends have converged:The government has tightened student-visa rules as part of a broader strategy to reduce net migration. Universities now face stricter monitoring of outcomes: refusal rates, enrolment follow-through, and student attendance.There has been a surge in asylum claims lodged by individuals who first entered the UK on a study or work visa. Ministers have warned universities that student routes must not become a “backdoor” to settlement.Some universities rely heavily on education agents to source students. Multiple insiders say poor vetting — particularly in high-volume markets — has led to a mix of strong applicants alongside others with weak documentation or questionable intentions.This combination has pushed refusal rates above the new threshold, putting institutions at risk of non-compliance.For thousands of genuine applicants, the consequences are immediate and painful:Education consultants in the region say the decisions are “heartbreaking” for students who did everything correctly but are caught in the crossfire of institutional risk-management.They also argue that UK universities themselves created the incentives that led to aggressive agent recruitment, weak documentation and fraudulent applications — and are now punishing students for it.The new rules are unforgiving. If a university breaches the 5 per cent refusal cap or other compliance metrics, it can lose its licence to sponsor international students for at least a year.A one-year loss could mean:Officials estimate that at least 22 universities would fail at least one compliance criterion if no corrective action is taken. Five of them could lose their sponsorship rights outright, cutting an estimated 12,000 international students from the system.For lower-fee universities, heavily dependent on international enrolments, even a brief suspension could be fatal.Institutions are now:The result is a cautious and sometimes blunt response: cutting entire markets to protect compliance.The UK government has made it clear that the new rules are intended to restore public confidence in the international student route. Ministers argue that genuine students remain welcome but institutions must take greater responsibility for screening applicants. At the same time, universities warn that the reforms will reshape the sector — reducing diversity, limiting access for students from developing countries, and pushing institutions toward more profitable markets such as China and the Gulf. The Home Office maintains that it “strongly values” international students but insists that only genuine applicants should come to the UK.The freeze on recruitment from Pakistan and Bangladesh is not a political statement by universities. It is a defensive manoeuvre forced by tougher immigration rules, high refusal rates and the fear of losing the right to sponsor students altogether. But regardless of the intention, the impact is immediate: thousands of South Asian students now find their UK education plans derailed, delayed or dropped — not because of their merit, but because the system around them changed overnight.","Several UK universities have stopped accepting new applications from Pakistan and Bangladesh after tighter Home Office rules.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's alleged secret daughter, Luiza Rozova, apologised for the Ukraine war when Ukrainian journalist Dmytro Sviatnenko confronted her on the streets of Paris.Sviatnenko’s brother, drone pilot Volodymyr, had been killed in a Russian airstrike in November, and the reporter demanded Rozova speak to her alleged father and urge him to end the conflict.“Three weeks ago, your father killed my brother,” Sviatnenko told Rozova. When asked if she supported Putin’s policies, she replied, “I did not give you permission to film me,” covering her mouth with a mask, New York Post reported.“I’m really sorry that this is happening. Unfortunately, I’m not responsible for this situation,” Rozova, 22 year old DJ, added.Sviatnenko pointed out that Kyiv was without power and under an air raid alert, and again asked how she felt about her father’s policies. Rozova responded, “What does that have to do with me?” He suggested she call her father and say, “Dad, stop shelling Kyiv.” Rozova said, “Well, of course,” but explained she could not arrange travel.When Sviatnenko offered to buy her a plane ticket to Ukraine so she could perform “better than any Patriot air defence system” and end the “mess” in his country, Rozova said, “Unfortunately, I can’t help you. I’m very sorry.”Who is Rozova?Rozova is alleged to be the love child of Putin and his former mistress, cleaner-turned-multimillionaire Svetlana Krivonogikh. Born in 2003, she was outed as Putin’s alleged secret daughter in 2020 by Russian media outlet Proekt, which cited her “phenomenal resemblance” to her alleged dad. The outlet reported that Putin was not listed on Rozova’s birth certificate but that her patronymic “Vladimirovna” meant “daughter of Vladimir. ”An art school graduate, Rozova had largely kept a low profile until she became more active on social media.

Just touched down in Saudi Arabia and eager to get behind the wheel? Whether you're planning to navigate Riyadh's busy streets or take a leisurely drive through Jeddah, your first step is to figure out if your foreign driving license can be easily converted, or if you'll need to start fresh.Whether you're a new resident or a long-term expat, this guide breaks down the process of converting your license or applying for a new Saudi driving license. We’ve got you covered with everything you need to know, so you won’t be left guessing.Foreigners are allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia under certain conditions. If you hold a valid international or foreign driving license, you can legally drive for up to one year from your date of arrival in the Kingdom, or until your license expires, whichever comes first. After this period, or if you become a resident, you will need to obtain a Saudi driving license.If you're from India, Europe, or any other country, you can drive in Saudi Arabia for up to one year using your home country’s driving license. However, you must carry both your original license and a translated International Driving Permit (IDP). The IDP is required by law for driving on a foreign license in Saudi Arabia, as it serves as an official translation of your original license.Keep in mind that driving without a valid Saudi or officially converted foreign license could result in fines or legal consequences, so be sure to get the necessary documentation in place before you hit the road.If you're planning to stay longer than a year, or you're applying for certain services, you’ll need to convert your license or obtain a new one, depending on where it's issued from.Saudi Arabia offers two different paths for obtaining a Saudi driving license, depending on where your original license was issued.If you're eligible for direct license conversion, meaning you hold a valid license from one of the approved countries, you can convert it directly into a Saudi license without the need to take a driving test. This process is much faster and more straightforward.However, if your home country is not on the approved list, you won’t be able to convert your license directly. Instead, you’ll need to apply as a new driver, which involves enrolling in a Saudi driving school. You’ll need to complete both theoretical and practical driving tests and pay for training sessions, testing, and issuance fees.If you hold a valid driving license from one of the 48 approved countries, including GCC countries, you’re generally eligible to convert it directly into a Saudi driving license, no driving test required. However, an application, proper translation, documentation, and a medical check are still mandatory.If your license is from one of these countries, here’s how you can convert it.Your first task is to get your driving license officially translated into Arabic. Without this step, the conversion process will not proceed.Use the official Absher portal ( absher.sa ) to book an appointment with the General Department of Traffic (Muroor).Use your bank’s online app to access Sadad under Government Payments and select “Driving License Issuance.”Visit an Efada-approved medical center for your health check, bringing:Tests include:On your appointment day, head to the designated Muroor office or traffic school with:Make sure you have your Iqama and all original documents ready, as they are required to complete your license issuance.If everything is in order and your license is from an approved country, you’ll receive your Saudi license the same day, no tests required.If your home country is not listed, you will need to apply as a new driver in Saudi Arabia. That means:This process is longer and involves multiple steps, including lessons and test scheduling, but is required for full legal driving eligibility in Saudi Arabia.Also read: How can foreigners obtain a Saudi driving license if they’re not eligible for direct conversion?",Saudi Arabia allows visitors from 48 countries to directly convert their driving licenses without a driving test.

The United States is planning to expand the number of countries that were covered by its travel ban - and the new list may include over 30 countries.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, on Thursday, during an interview on Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle, when asked whether President Donald Trump’s administration would increase the number to 32, she said “I won’t be specific on the number, but it’s over 30, and the president is continuing to evaluate countries. ""In June, Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats, Reuters reported.The bans applied to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travellers.Noem did not specify which countries would be added to the list. “If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” she said.Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable.An expansion of the list would mark a further escalation of migration measures the administration had taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week.Investigators said the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement programme under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting. Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define “third-world countries.”Prior to that, officials from the Department of Homeland Security said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the administration of his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, and Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries. Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push, but until now it has put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration.","US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the president is 'continuing to evaluate countries' In June, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation banning citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States.

India’s Growing Imports of Russian Crude Oil

Russia's position in India's oil procurement landscape has seen a substantial shift since the Ukraine conflict. Prior to 2021, Russian supply was minimal, with yearly crude purchases hovering around $2-3 billion, constituting just 1-2% of India's total oil acquisitions.

This scenario altered significantly in 2022, with purchases reaching $25.5 billion, increasing Russia's contribution to approximately 15% of India's crude imports, as sanctions redirected Russian oil towards Asian markets at reduced prices.

The figures escalated in 2023, with imports reaching $48.6 billion, pushing Russia's share to 34.6%, establishing it as India's primary oil supplier, surpassing traditional Gulf sources.

In 2024, the value increased to $52.7 billion, with Russia's portion reaching 37.3% of total crude imports. This three-year transition has fundamentally altered India's energy security considerations and increased its involvement in global oil sanctions politics.

India-Russia: Trade & Defence Dynamics





What will be the outcome of Putin’s India visit?

GTRI envisions two scenarios as outcomes of Putin’s visit to India:

Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s India visit this week is being closely watched by the world - especially to understand what will it mean for India’s trade dynamics with both Russia and the US. Will India bring down its crude oil imports from Russia or look to maintain its autonomy while navigating pressure from US President Donald Trump? The answer is not straightforward - laced in geopolitical, economic and diplomatic issues!Putin is making his first diplomatic visit to India since the conflict in Ukraine started, marking a crucial diplomatic milestone amidst complex geopolitical circumstances. Discounted Russian crude has reshaped India’s energy security but deepened its exposure to sanctions and geopolitical risk, says Ajay Srivastava, founder of Global Trade Research Initiative.The visit occurs at a complex time. India faces continuous US pressure regarding its Russian oil purchases whilst being urged to increase access for American products and defence equipment in its markets.“Putin’s visit is not a nostalgic return to Cold War diplomacy. It is a negotiation over risk, supply chains and economic insulation. A modest outcome will secure oil and defence; an ambitious one will reshape regional economics. The visit is ultimately not about choosing sides—but about managing dependence in a fractured world,” GTRI says.History explains the resilience of the partnership. During the Cold War, the United States backed Pakistan and deployed the USS Enterprise during the 1971 war.The Soviet Union responded with weapons support and diplomatic shielding at the United Nations. Moscow stood by India after its 1962 war with China, provided repeated diplomatic backing over Kashmir, and remained a defence partner after India’s 1998 nuclear tests brought Western sanctions. “ Over decades, Russia transferred strategic technologies the West withheld. Even today, about 60–70% of India’s military platforms remain of Russian origin. The partnership was built in conflict, not commerce,” the think tank says.Also Read | Trump sanctions: India’s crude imports from Russia at 5-month high - can it continue? According to GTRI, India’s current engagement with Russia rests on three pillars—energy, defence and diplomacy. Energy now dominates the relationship.Russia has become India’s largest crude oil supplier, accounting for as much as 30–35% of total oil imports, turning discounted crude into the foundation of the partnership.Defence forms the second pillar. Russia continues to supply and service a majority of India’s frontline platforms—fighter jets, submarines, tanks and air defence systems—and talks continue on maintenance support and future acquisitions.The third pillar is diplomatic coordination through multilaterals including BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the Eastern Economic Forum, alongside cooperation in nuclear power, space exploration, fertilizers and connectivity.Even as India deepens relations with Washington, Brussels and Tokyo, it treats Moscow as essential to its strategic autonomy, notes GTRI.Russia has emerged as India's main oil supplier, making up approximately one-third of total crude imports in 2024. A substantial increase in India's expenditure on Russian oil is evident, rising from $2.3bn in 2021 to $52.7bn in 2024 - a significant shift in energy procurement patterns.Financial sanctions have necessitated alternative payment arrangements. Following Russia's partial SWIFT exclusion, payments now involve multiple currencies: dirhams (60-65%), rupees (25-30%), and yuan (5-10%). Approximately ₹60,000 crore in rupees remain largely unutilised in dedicated Indian accounts. Russian preference has shifted towards UAE dirham settlements, offering better spending and conversion flexibility. Yuan transactions occur periodically. While functional, this arrangement remains susceptible to instability and political pressures.“In energy, New Delhi is expected to pursue long-term crude contracts with Non US sanctioned Russian firms like Lukoil and Roseneft, revival of Indian investments in Russian energy projects, and advancement of nuclear cooperation beyond Kudankulam. Cooperation in critical minerals, manufacturing and maritime connectivity linking India with Russia’s Far East may also be discussed,” says GTRI.Also Read | India’s love for Russian oil continues? State refiners pick non-sanctioned crude at higher discounts; but will Moscow remain top supplier? GTRI points out the defence relationship remains vital, as approximately two-thirds of India's military equipment comes from Russia, linking operational capability to Russian components and modernisation programmes.Indian defence officials plan to request faster delivery of additional S-400 Triumf systems whilst seeking assurances regarding maintenance and upgrades for Russian-origin equipment. Discussions about the Su-57 stealth fighter are anticipated, though primarily as a long-term prospect rather than immediate acquisition.India's exports to Russia stand at approximately $5bn annually, whilst imports, primarily energy-related, reach nearly $64bn. India’s export footprint in Russia is narrow, with pharmaceuticals and machinery strong but garments, electronics and consumer goods negligible. Payments are increasingly de-dollarised, routed through UAE dirhams, rupees and yuan, reflecting the workaround economy created by sanctions, says GTRI.Trade figures between India and Russia show a significant imbalance, with limited export expansion but substantial energy-focused imports. Indian exports increased from $4.3 billion in FY24 to $4.9 billion in FY25, achieving $2.25 billion during April-September 2025.The exports concentrate primarily on industrial and chemical products, with machinery ($367.8 million), pharmaceuticals ($246 million), and organic chemicals ($165.8 million) constituting the main share in FY26's first half. Other sectors show minimal presence: smartphones ($75.9 million), Vannamei shrimp ($75.7 million), meat ($63 million), and garments ($20.94 million), reflecting India's restricted access to Russian consumer markets and electronics sectors despite strategic shifts.Russian imports maintain their dominance, reaching $63.2 billion in FY24 and $63.8 billion in FY25, with April-September 2025 recording $31.2 billion. The import composition heavily features petroleum, specifically crude oil ($23.1 billion) and petroleum products ($2.5 billion), alongside coal ($1.9 billion). Essential imports include fertilisers ($1.3 billion), sunflower seed oil ($633 million), and diamonds ($202 million).This creates an unbalanced trading relationship where India depends on Russia for crucial energy resources and raw materials whilst facing challenges in expanding its value-added exports, creating a trade dynamic susceptible to international commodity price fluctuations.The most likely outcome is a cautious strengthening of existing ties. India could secure firm timelines on defence deliveries, maintenance contracts, and technology upgrades for aircraft, tanks and submarines. Russia, in turn, may lock in long-term energy commitments—including revived Indian equity in LNG fields, multi-year crude supply agreements, and accelerated nuclear plant construction, says GTRI. The two countries may also formalize a new payment framework using the dirham or integrate Russia’s SPFS system with India’s RuPay network. This scenario stabilizes the relationship without significantly raising diplomatic costs, it says.The more ambitious alternative would mark a deeper realignment. “India and Russia could agree on joint production of defence equipment, Indian investment in Russian oil and gas projects such as Arctic LNG 2 or Vostok, and expansion of nuclear cooperation beyond existing reactors,” says the think tank.“Connectivity initiatives like the Chennai–Vladivostok corridor or nodes of the International North–South Transport Corridor could also gain momentum. A structured settlement framework could be unveiled to reduce idle rupee balances. This scenario would reshape India’s Eurasian integration—but potentially provoke sharper Western response,” it adds.“Beyond optics, the summit is about securing fuel, weapons and payments against a world of financial and political fragmentation. For India, the challenge is strategic balance—protecting autonomy while navigating pressure from Washington and dependence on Moscow,” concludes GTRI.",Putin is making his first diplomatic visit to India since the conflict in Ukraine started. India faces continuous US pressure regarding its Russian oil purchases whilst being urged to increase access for American products and defence equipment in its markets.

Donald Trump's Stricter H-1B Visa Rule Hits Indian Talent, Background Check Screening Expanded





Researcher Simon Hankinson who worked as a visa officer in India opened up about his experience of interviewing for H-1B visa program 25 years ago and said he did not fail to see even at the beginning what was wrong with the program. In an opinion piece for Fox News, Hankinson wrote that something was badly wrong with the program which intended to bring 'specialty' workers to the US. But in reality, even 25 years ago, it was average college graduates that he interviewed for the visa program, he said.Hankinson said it's unfair to compare between a Chinese of an Indian student with an American student as a Chinese or Indian student goes to free or inexpensive schools in their countries, gets a BA, MA or even a PhD with little debt. But in America, students are borrowing thousands of dollars to get to the same level. ""They can’t take jobs at the same low salaries their H-1B competitors can,"" Hankinson said.""Amazon got over 10,000 approvals for H-1B visas in 2025, in the same year as they announced cuts of over 30,000 jobs. Was any effort made to retrain or re-assign Americans? Many other large US companies follow the same pattern: hire abroad, fire at home.""Hankinson also said that US companies do not need a lot of specialty workers. ""The truth is, the number of real ""specialty"" workers that even big American companies really need should fit in a bus, not a stadium. And they should be willing to pay a high premium for them,"" he wrote.""If AI firms are really willing to pay up to a hundred million dollars in signing bonuses for top talent, they will be willing to pay high salaries to get a few essential foreign workers. Some in Washington want to increase visas for foreign workers. Some even believe that Americans should have to compete for their jobs with the whole world. I don’t,"" he wrote.In his recent H-1B report for the Heritage Foundation, Hankinson cited the example of Indian politician Kandi Srinivas Reddy, who allegedly used several shell companies to submit multiple H-1B petitions for the same workers. In the 2020 lottery, Reddy reportedly submitted more than 3000 entries, Hankinson wrote, pointing out the abuse of the system that went on for a long time.",Researcher Simon Hankinson who worked as a visa officer in India opened up about his experience of interviewing for H-1B visa program 25 years ago.

US District Judge Rodney Smith on Friday ordered the release of grand jury transcripts from the Florida investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein . Judge Smith said in a brief order that the Epstein Files Transparency Act mandates their release.The Justice Department requested the unsealing after President Donald Trump signed a bill last month requiring the public release of all govt records regarding Epstein. Grand jury proceedings are generally kept secret, and a previous Justice Department request to unseal the transcripts from Epstein’s Florida case was rebuffed.Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida in 2008 to a state charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution. The wealthy financier was arrested again in New York in 2019 on charges of sex trafficking of minors. He died while in pre-trial detention, and his death was ruled to be a suicide.The Justice Department is also seeking the release of the grand jury transcripts from the New York case and that of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting underage girls for Epstein.Trump, a once close friend of Epstein, fought for months to prevent the release of the Epstein files held by the Justice Department.However, on November 19 he caved to pressure from Congress, including from his Republican Party, and signed a law compelling release of the materials.The Epstein Files Transparency Act calls for the release within 30 days of ""all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials"" in the possession of the Justice Department, the FBI and US attorneys’ offices related to Epstein and Maxwell.The FBI and Justice Department triggered a political furor in July with the release of a memo stating that after an ""exhaustive review"" of the Epstein files no evidence had emerged that would warrant further investigation.","The Justice Department requested the unsealing after President Donald Trump signed a bill last month requiring the public release of all govt records regarding Epstein.

Vice President JD Vance on Friday dismissed a wave of online speculation about his marriage, saying his relationship with Second Lady Usha Vance is “as strong as it’s ever been.”He said the couple has taken the growing swirl of social media rumors in stride, opting to laugh off the speculation about their personal lives.This comes after a recent rash of tabloid-style headlines that surfaced when the second lady was photographed without her wedding ring.“I think that we kind of get a kick out of it,” Vance said in an interview with NBC News, when asked whether the recent controversy had frustrated him.“With anything in life, you take the good with the bad,” Vance said, adding that ""there are some sacrifices and there are some very good things that come along with it, too. But our marriage is as strong as it’s ever been, and I think Usha’s really taken to it, and it’s been kind of cool to see how she’s developed and evolved in this new role.”The couple’s marriage drew online scrutiny after Usha Vance was spotted without her wedding ring during a November 19 visit to Camp Lejeune, a military training facility in Jacksonville, North Carolina, where she accompanied First Lady Melania Trump.The attention intensified in October when former White House press secretary Jen Psaki sparked controversy by joking about “saving” Usha Vance from her marriage to the vice president, prompting a sharp response from the White House.Responding after the photos of her missing wedding ring went viral, a spokesperson for the second lady said in a statement that she is “a mother of three young children, who does a lot of dishes, gives lots of baths and forgets her ring sometimes.”Vance shared a more recent anecdote from a few days earlier, recounting how he and his wife were rushing to the White House before the second lady departed for another event with Melania Trump. As she got into the car, Usha Vance realized she had once again left her rings behind after taking a shower.“She was like, ‘Oh, if I don’t go back and get them, there’s going to be some ridiculous psycho who talks about it on social media,’” Vance was quoted as saying by NBC News. “And I was like, let them. It’s not even worth the trip to run back upstairs. So we actually have a little bit of fun with it. And we thought that whole viral social media cycle was kind of funny.”The vice president addressed the situation when asked whether such stories had been difficult for the couple, who tied the knot in 2014.“It’s funny,” he said. “I actually don’t think that it’s tough.”The couple has been in the spotlight since US President Donald Trump chose Vance as his running mate for the 2024 presidential election.They met at Yale Law School, married in 2014, and have three children. Usha Vance previously worked as a trial lawyer at the Munger, Tolles & Olson law firm but stepped away from her career shortly after her husband joined the ticket.","Vice President JD Vance said his marriage to Second Lady Usha Vance is as strong as it's ever been.

He expressed views supportive of Trump, according to the person familiar with the investigation, who was not authorised to speak publicly.Cole spoke to investigators after his arrest at his home in Woodbridge, Va., that he shares with his mother and other family members, about 30 miles from Washington, according to an FBI affidavit filed in court.New leaders at the FBI and the DOJ intensified their focus on the case this year amid intense pressure to solve the crime from Trump’s political base.The FBI released an image with a size chart showing the height of the alleged pipe bomber at 5 foot 7 inches.Attorney General Pam Bondi said the investigation continued and more charges may be added. ""Today's arrest happened because the Trump administration made this case a priority,"" she said at a press conference on Thursday. ""This cold case languished for four years, until Director [Kash] Patel and Deputy Director [Dan] Bongino came to the FBI.""""We are working every day to restore the public's trust. We are hoping today is a significant step toward that progress,"" Bondi said at the presser.Cole made his first court appearance on Friday. He wore a beige jumpsuit and glasses and answered questions from the judge. The next hearing will be a pretrial detention hearing on Dec. 15.Bondi said the FBI had no new tips or new witnesses but had relied on ""diligent"" police and prosecutorial work to identify the suspect. The FBI had previously set a Rs 4.15 crore (approx) reward for information leading to his capture.FBI Director Kash Patel said, ""We solved it,"" adding that the suspect will still have his day in court.FBI Director Kash Patel spoke with Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum last month.An FBI affidavit said Cole purchased components that could have been used to make the pipe bombs, including electrical wire, steel wool, battery connectors and parts to close the end of a pipe.Court papers also said a cell phone tied to Cole pinged cell towers near the RNC and DNC the night the bombs were placed. A license plate reader near the area captured his car, a Nissan Sentra, that evening.Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney for the District of Columbia, said, ""This case involved millions of pieces of data, and it is a huge win, because it was like finding a needle in a haystack.""The discovery of the bombs occurred at a critical moment on January 6-2021. The first device was found just before the initial breach of rioters at the Peace Circle, and the second was discovered as the Proud Boys helped flood the Capitol's west front and the fighting was intensifying.Capitol Police Inspector General Michael Bolton told Congress in 2021, ""If those pipe bombs were intended to be a diversion, plainly speaking, it worked.""Former USCP Chief Steven Sund wrote in his book, ""I believe the timing and placement of these devices were deliberate diversionary tactics, intended to divert significant resources away from securing the Capitol, which they succeeded in doing.""Before joining the FBI as deputy director, Bongino spread conspiracies about the bomber and said it must've been an ""inside job"" by the government.","FBI arrested Brian J.

FIFA Raises Trump Speculations After Announcing ‘YMCA’ Performance For 2026 World Cup Draw





US President Donald Trump on Friday stole the spotlight at the FIFA 2026 World Cup draw when he rose from his seat at the Kennedy Center and performed his signature “YMCA” dance. The moment came as organizers brought the Village People on stage to perform the hit number, a staple at Trump campaign rallies alongside “Nessun dorma. ”Trump attended the event alongside Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.The ceremony was co-hosted by actor-comedian Kevin Hart and supermodel Heidi Klum, and featured appearances by sports icons including Tom Brady, Shaquille O’Neal, Wayne Gretzky, Eli Manning and Aaron Judge.The US president also received the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize from the sport’s global governing body.""Mr President, this is your prize. This is your peace prize,"" said Gianni Infantino, the president of the international football association as presented the prize to Trump. ""There is also a beautiful medal for you that you can wear everywhere you want to go.""Trump then placed the gong around his neck, saying, “I’m going to wear it right now.”Football fans around the world tuned in to the World Cup draw to see how the match-ups would take shape, and organizers are hoping that same global interest will translate into strong attendance at the tournament.Trump said earlier this week that ticket sales were “good,” though questions remain about how the event will ultimately unfold. The matches begin in June and will culminate in the July 19 final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.Concerns, however, have been raised. In a July 1 letter to FIFA, more than 80 civil rights and labor groups warned that the Trump administration’s immigration policies could affect the staging of the World Cup, as cited by USA Today.At the event, Trump, Sheinbaum, and Carney took part in the proceedings by drawing their countries into predetermined World Cup groups before the remaining slots in the 12 four-team groups were filled.North Macedonia and Curaçao, whose qualification prospects have improved with the expansion of the World Cup from 32 to 48 teams, were among the beneficiaries of the new format. The increase also pushed the number of groups from eight to 12.The expanded field made the draw more complex, with six of the 48 teams still undecided. Those remaining spots will be determined through playoffs in March, requiring the use of placeholders during the draw, as cited by AP.The expanded field also reduced the likelihood of several top-tier teams being placed in the same group.",US President Donald Trump stole the spotlight at the FIFA 2026 World Cup draw when he performed his signature ‘YMCA’ dance.

Vanity Fair and West Coast editor Olivia Nuzzi have ""mutually agreed"" to part their ways after her contract with the Condé Nast-owned magazine expires.The decision came after the controversy over allegations of Nuzzi's affair with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other past behavior.A joint statement Friday from Vanity Fair and West Coast editor Olivia Nuzzi said they “have mutually agreed, in the best interest of the magazine, to let her contract expire at the end of the year.” Nuzzi had joined the magazine in September as West Coast editor, AP news agency reported.The decision followed controversy over Nuzzi’s personal relationship with Robert F Kennedy Jr. while she was a Washington correspondent for New York magazine. The relationship emerged in the fall of 2024, when it was revealed that Kennedy, then a presidential candidate and now head of the Department of Health and Human Services, had been intimately involved with Nuzzi.New York magazine dismissed Nuzzi for failing to disclose the relationship. She later reflected on the affair and its consequences in her memoir American Canto, which refers to Kennedy as “The Politician” and ex-fiancé Ryan Lizza as “the man I did not marry.”Excerpts appeared in Vanity Fair but competed for attention with a series of Substack posts by Lizza containing embarrassing allegations.The feud between Nuzzi and Lizza gripped media insiders after he alleged that she had an affair with another profile subject and had given Kennedy political advice—both considered off limits for journalists. Lizza also published salacious, cringeworthy text messages from Kennedy to Nuzzi that he had intercepted.Following the revelation, the magazine placed Nuzzi on leave, and they later parted ways. But Nuzzi had recently returned to a newsroom after Vanity Fair's recently appointed global editorial director Mark Guiducci named her West Coast editor in September.In a Substack interview with Emily Sundberg, Nuzzi denounced her ex-fiancé’s posts as “fiction-slash-revenge porn.”Friday’s announcement came only days after the publication of American Canto, which critics disdained and readers largely ignored. The book ranked just 6,094 on Amazon.com’s bestseller list as of Friday afternoon.During the turbulent week, Nuzzi published a humorous Substack column titled “Signs Your Book Rollout Has Gone Awry,” including the entry “Monica Lewinsky reaches out to check on your mental health.”","Vanity Fair and West Coast editor Olivia Nuzzi have ""mutually agreed"" to part their ways after her contract with the Condé Nast-owned magazine expires.

A former Pentagon official has come up with an unexpected way to credit US President Donald Trump for boosting India–Russia ties — a relationship anchored in a 2000 strategic partnership and elevated in 2010.While talking with ANI on Saturday, former Pentagon official Michael Rubin said that President Trump deserves a Nobel Prize for bringing India and Russia together.""From Russia's perspective, the visit is extremely positive, and India has bestowed honours on Vladimir Putin that he can hardly get anywhere else in the world. I would actually argue that Donald Trump deserves a Nobel Prize for bringing India and Russia together the way he did,"" he said.He further added, ""How many of these agreements (MoUs) are actually gonna come to fruition?

Because Donald Trump isn't going to admit that he is the one at fault.

FBI director Kash Patel 's girlfriend reacted and laughed off a fresh gossip that her boyfriend wanted FBI security detail to drop her 'drunk friend' home, on one occasion and was refused. MSNOW claimed that this happened more than once that Patel ordered the security detail protecting Alexis to escort one of her drunk friends after a night of partying in Nashville. The report said the security agents objected to diverting from their assignment but Patel insisted because Winkins had requested. The report also claimed that once Patel called the head of Wilkins' security details and yelled at him.The report came as Patel had been fighting a stiff resistance against him as the FBI chief coming from inside the MAGA base. It was also reported that Kash Patel would lose his post by December 15 but President Donald Trump dismissed the speculations and said he was doing a great job. Patel's personal relationship, his use of FBI assets for his personal travels, for his girlfriend's security -- everything has come under scrutiny. Recently, a report by former FBi agents claimed that Patel threw tantrums when he reached Utah soon after Charlie Kirk's assassination, as he did not have his FBI jacket. The report claimed he was not ready to get off the plane unless he had an FBI jacket with a perfect fit.Patel himself refuted the jacket story and claimed that he was handed over a jacket, and he was honored to wear it, calling the tantrums episode 100% fabricated. Similarly, the FBI said the 'drunk friend' story is false and Alexis does not even drink.FBI spokesperson Ben Williamson said after he received the allegation from the reporter, he checked with all the parties concerned -- Kash Patel, Alexis Wilkins , the security detail. All of them said it didn't happen but the reporter claimed that they have trust on their sources.""I got this allegation on Tuesday. It sounded made up and I told the reporter so. I went and checked with everyone involved - Alexis (who doesn’t even drink), the Director, the Detail, and more - all of whom said it didn’t happen.

President Donald Trump's National Security Strategy 2025 , in which he outlined what he wants from the world, has been released. India found four mentions in the 29-page document and one of them was in connection with Trump's claim that he negotiated peace between India and Pakistan -- among other countries.The second mention comes where Trump says US must work with allies and partners. ""We must continue to improve commercial (and other) relations with India to encourage New Delhi to contribute to Indo-Pacific security, including through continued quadrilateral cooperation with Australia, Japan, and the United States (“the Quad”),"" the document said.

There, the President won the Gulf States’ support for America’s superior AI technology, deepening our partnerships. America should similarly enlist our European and Asian allies and partners, including India, to cement and improve our joint positions in the Western Hemisphere and, with regard to critical minerals, in Africa,"" the third mention of India said.The fourth mention was in the context of the South China Sea.""Strong measures must be developed along with the deterrence necessary to keep those lanes open, free of “tolls,” and not subject to arbitrary closure by one country. This will require not just further investment in our military—especially naval—capabilities, but also strong cooperation with every nation that stands to suffer, from India to Japan and beyond, if this problem is not addressed,"" the document said.Another major takeaway from the strategy document was its firm stand against migration. ""In countries throughout the world, mass migration has strained domestic resources, increased violence and other crime, weakened social cohesion, distorted labor markets, and undermined national security. The era of mass migration must end. Border security is the primary element of national security. We must protect our country from invasion, not just from unchecked migration but from cross-border threats such as terrorism, drugs, espionage, and human trafficking.

The Donald Trump administration took a host of measures in the aftermath of DC shooting in which the suspect was identified as an Afghan national who was given asylum in the US.

Trump announced that he would terminate the Temporary Protected Status for Somalia. This would make Somalis open to be arrested. The crackdown on Somalis stemmed from financial fraud allegations in Minnesota.

Trump announced an immigration ban on 'third-world countries' without specifying which countries will be affected.

on 'third-world countries' without specifying which countries will be affected. The administration put a hold on immigration requests from 19 countries of concern. These 19 countries are those that were put on a complete/partial travel ban list earlier.

India does not feature any of these lists and there is no ban on Indians in the US. But Indian remains the center of the immigration topic as India contributes the maximum to the H-1B visa program which is a specialty visa to hire skilled workers from foreign countries.





Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal emerged as a loud voice against Donald Trump's crackdown on Somali migrants in Minnesota, as she said 'being undocumented is not a crime'. While her statement invited intense criticism, Jayapal explained that overstaying a visa or being undocumented in the US is not a criminal offence, but a civil offence and hence undocumented migrants should be held in civil detention facilities, not in prisons.""We really have to look into the problem of Indians' low self-esteem,"" Right-wing writer Ann Coulter wrote on X taking a jibe at Jayapal who was born in India.In an interview with MS Now, Jayapal also said that immigrants from Somalia, India, Latin America, and Africa built America.

Ro Khanna said the concept of 'third-world countries' is a pre-1965 idea. ""If Trump had his way, my parents who taught me to love this country would not have been welcome.

13,000 videos recorded in six years





Oumair Aejaz, an Indian-origin former doctor from Michigan, was sentenced to 35-60 years in prison on charges of sexual misconduct after he secretly recorded women and children exploiting his position as a doctor. He started at his home as he filmed his wife, their young children and female relatives, the wife told the police in 2024 that started the investigation. Aejaz was charged on 31 counts of sexual misconduct and he pleaded no contest. As he was sentenced on December 2, the courtroom witnessed the pain of his victims as they came forward, calling out the evil, sadistic doctor.As the women recounted how they have been affected, the judge said Oumair Aejaz's actions were beyond words. “Incomprehensible that there’s a human being that could stoop to this level of conduct. You are not deserving of any title or any recognition. You have damaged so many lives, hurt so many people and all I can do is put you in prison,” the judge said before sentencing. “I wish I could do more, but I can’t.”Investigation against Awjaz began in August 2024 after his wife submitted evidence that she was being secretly recorded.Their two minor children and several female relatives had also been filmed. Investigators found that Aejaz recoded children and adults at Goldfish Swim School in Rochester Hills, Michigan, as well as children and adults in hospital rooms and bedrooms using a hidden camera.A search warrant recovered six computers, four cell phones and 15 hard drives. One hard drive reportedly contained over 13,000 videos Aejaz recorded over the last six years.Aejaz did not speak at his sentencing but four women spoke before the judge made her decision. “Stop looking at the ground, you coward. Look up and look me in the eyes. I address you because you had the audacity when you decided to wander in the swim school, turn on a camera, place it upward in a two foot space that was at the bottom of those changing rooms, and then sit there for God knows how long just recording the moms, parents, dads, aunts, uncles, grandmas with their kids as their kids were literally changing out of their wet swimsuits.

A new jaguar spotted in Arizona points to progress in the endangered species' recovery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-new-jaguar-spotted-in-arizona-points-to-progress-in-the-endangered-species-recovery/articleshow/125793811.cms,"Photo credit- AP





The spots gave it away. Just like a human fingerprint, the rosette pattern on each jaguar is unique so researchers knew they had a new animal on their hands after reviewing images captured by a remote camera in southern Arizona.The University of Arizona Wild Cat Research and Conservation Center says it's the fifth big cat over the last 15 years to be spotted in the area after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The animal was captured by the camera as it visited a watering hole in November, its distinctive spots setting it apart from previous sightings.""We're very excited. It signifies this edge population of jaguars continues to come here because they're finding what they need,"" Susan Malusa, director of the center's jaguar and ocelot project, said during an interview Thursday.The team is now working to collect scat samples to conduct genetic analysis and determine the sex and other details about the new jaguar, including what it likes to eat. The menu can include everything from skunks and javelina to small deer.As an indicator species, Malusa said the continued presence of big cats in the region suggests a healthy landscape but that climate change and border barriers can threaten migratory corridors.She explained that warming temperatures and significant drought increase the urgency to ensure connectivity for jaguars with their historic range in Arizona.More than 99% of the jaguar's range is found in Central and South America, and the few male jaguars that have been spotted in the U.S. are believed to have dispersed from core populations in Mexico, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Officials have said that jaguar breeding in the U.S. has not been documented in more than 100 years.Federal biologists have listed primary threats to the endangered species as habitat loss and fragmentation along with the animals being targeted for trophies and illegal trade.The Fish and Wildlife Service issued a final rule in 2024, revising the habitat set aside for jaguars in response to a legal challenge. The area was reduced to about 1,000 square miles (2,590 square kilometers) in Arizona's Pima, Santa Cruz and Cochise counties.Recent detection data supports findings that a jaguar appears every few years, Malusa said, with movement often tied to the availability of water. When food and water are plentiful, there's less movement.In the case of Jaguar #5, she said it was remarkable that the cat kept returning to the area over a 10-day period. Otherwise, she described the animals as quite elusive.""That's the message - that this species is recovering,"" Malusa said. ""We want people to know that and that we still do have a chance to get it right and keep these corridors open.""",The University of Arizona Wild Cat Research and Conservation Center says it's the fifth big cat over the last 15 years to be spotted in the area after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.

TOI Correspondent from Washington:





At a time the Trump administration is attriting India’s security and economy with punitive tariffs and indulgence towards hostile neighbors, the new US 2025 National Security Strategy wants to enlist New Delhi to prevent domination by “any single competitor nation” while advancing its own primacy.The 29-page report released on Friday marks a significant reorientation of US foreign policy in generations, rejecting the bipartisan internationalist framework that has guided Washington since the end of the Cold War. In doing so, it fundamentally redefines America’s posture toward Asia, India, and the Indo-Pacific, recasting it to advance US interests, seemingly at the expense of allies and partners it ostensibly views as vassal states.Where previous iterations of the NSS emphasised alliances, trade liberalisation, multilateralism, and the maintenance of a rules-based international order, the 2025 document characterises such commitments as the misguided work of “our elites,” who allegedly saddled Americans with an unsustainable burden. It argues that successive administrations built “a vast military, regulatory and foreign-aid apparatus” while enabling allies to “offload the cost of their defence onto the American people.In stark contrast, the new NSS is blunt in announcing what it calls a “Necessary, welcome correction”: a hard pivot toward unilateral action, economic nationalism, and the uncompromising pursuit of “core national interests” — sovereignty, homeland defence, self-reliance, and domestic industrial strength.Gone is the aspirational language of values promotion, democracy assistance, or stewardship of the global commons. In its place is an isolationist, highly transactional framework that explicitly rejects the foreign-policy consensus of the Obama, Bush, and Biden eras. Essentially, it offers a foreign policy of withdrawal wrapped in the language of national resurrection, with a focus on domestic economic renewal and sovereignty.The change is particularly stark for India, which finds four mentions in the report, including the discredited claim of Trump having brought about a truce in war with Pakistan.“We must continue to improve commercial (and other) relations with India to encourage New Delhi to contribute to Indo-Pacific security, including through continued quadrilateral cooperation with Australia, Japan, and the United States (“the Quad”),” the report says, mirthlessly prefacing its outlook with that assertion that the US “must work with our treaty allies and partners to counteract predatory economic practices and use our combined economic power to help safeguard our prime position in the world economy” – this at a time Washington has kneecapped India’s economy with punitive tariffs and sanctions while kissing up to China.Elsewhere, the report says America should “enlist our European and Asian allies and partners, including India, to cement and improve our joint positions in the Western Hemisphere and, with regard to critical minerals, in Africa,” forming “coalitions that use our comparative advantages in finance and technology to build export markets with cooperating countries.” By most accounts, the US is attriting any advantage India has in finance and technology.Broadly, the NSS reframes India as a diplomatic challenge to be managed rather than as a strategic partner, as viewed by previous administrations, including during Trump 1. Instead of treating New Delhi as a counterweight in balancing China, the NSS positions India as a participant whose contributions to regional security must be coaxed rather than cultivated through shared values or long-term alignment.Remarkably for a country that was largely built by European settlers with land stolen from Native Americans, the report also takes on the burden of protecting western civilisation, asserting the US wants to “support our allies in preserving the freedom and security of Europe, while restoring Europe’s civilisational self-confidence and Western identity,” warning of a continent where “certain Nato members will become majority non-European. ”The NSS was widely panned both by Trump critics, as expected, but also from MAGA nativists.

The USCIS has announced an immediate hold on all asylum requests pending a comprehensive review. This has nothing to do with any country. This is applicable to all asylum applications. An individual can apply for asylum in the US when they can prove that they are facing persecution in their own country.

The administration has halted all immigration requests from 19 countries pending review.

The administration will also conduct a comprehensive re-review of approved benefit requests from these 19 countries.

The candidates may get called for a potential interview and, if necessary, a re-interview, to fully assess all national security and public safety threats along with any other related grounds of inadmissibility or ineligibility. The administration said it will now do a case-by-case review and assessment.





A massive delay in processing all forms of immigration applications is now inevitable as the Donald Trump administration ordered a re-review of all Green Cards issued during the Biden administration to the nationals of 19 countries of concern. All asylum cases approved under the Biden administration from these 19 countries will also be reviewed again.Ricky Murray, who was chief of staff of Refugee and International Operations at USCIS until November 29, told Newsweek that such orders are unprecedented and this will slow down the immigration work, leading to a backlog.""This is going to have a tremendous effect on the backlog. Having to pull resources together to review hundreds of thousands of cases is going to require thousands of man-hours. These man-hours are only going to be taken from processing of new filings,"" Murray said. ""There are finite resources. You can expect to see significant delays in the processing of any new forms in the area that USCIS steals the resources from to do this re-review. """"The memo is unique in that it is using a single event to call into question the validity of the benefits of thousands of immigrants, almost all who have nothing to do with this isolated event. Immigrants of 18 of the 19 countries have no ties to this event, and even a very limited number of Afghans have ever even had contact with the perpetrator of the heinous event spurring this release of this memo,"" Murray said.",USCIS has announced an immediate hold on all asylum requests pending a comprehensive review.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





Pakistan’s defence ministry on Friday officially notified the appointment of Field Marshal Asim Munir as the country’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).The ""president, on the advice of the prime minister, is pleased to appoint Field Marshal Asim Munir (NI) M as the chief of army staff, concurrently the chief of defence forces for a tenure of five years,” the notification read, news agency PTI reported citing Dawn.This comes a day after President Asif Ali Zardari approved his appointment on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.According to the notification issued under Article 243 of Pakistan’s Constitution and the amended Pakistan Army Act, Munir will serve concurrently as Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces for a tenure of five years. The notification marks the most significant restructuring of Pakistan’s military command since the 1970s.The appointment follows the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment last month, which created the new CDF post to establish a unified command structure and enable faster decision-making in critical situations.The amendment also abolished the office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which had coordinated the tri-services since 1976. The CJCSC post formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.With the restructuring, operational, administrative and strategic authority of the armed forces has been consolidated into a single office headed by the CDF. The revised Article 243 provides that the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, will appoint the army chief, who will concurrently serve as the CDF.Munir was first appointed Army Chief in November 2022 for three years. His tenure was extended to five years in 2024 after amendments to the Pakistan Army Act.He was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal days after the four-day conflict with India in May, becoming only the second officer in Pakistan’s history to hold the rank after Field Marshal Ayub Khan.Alongside Munir’s notification, the defence ministry also confirmed a two-year extension for Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu. His extended tenure as Chief of the Air Staff will begin in March 2026 and continue till March 2028.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Munir on his “historic” appointment, saying his leadership had been pivotal in guiding Pakistan’s armed forces. He also praised the air chief for his command during recent operations. defence minister Khawaja Asif and other senior leaders also extended their congratulations, according to Dawn.Information minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan’s defence had strengthened with the establishment of a unified command. Dismissing speculation over the delay in the notification, he said rumours circulating on social and electronic media had proven baseless.Earlier uncertainty had followed the abolition of the CJCSC post and the end of Munir’s original three-year term in late November, leading to political speculation over upcoming four-star appointments. Government officials maintained that the delay was procedural and linked to the prime minister’s travel schedule.Explaining the significance of the new post, army spokesman Lt General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry said the CDF headquarters would improve coordination across modern, multi-domain warfare involving land, sea, air, cyber, space and intelligence operations. He added that many countries already operate under similar unified command structures.Under the amended military laws, the five-year tenure of the first COAS-plus-CDF is deemed to begin from the date of notification, effectively resetting Munir’s term. The law also allows future reappointments or extensions of up to five years, creating the legal framework for continuity in leadership.The next major step under the new structure will be the appointment of the Commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position responsible for strategic assets. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.Meanwhile, law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the defence ministry is finalising a new organogram for the CDF to clearly define command flows between the CDF, the service chiefs and the newly created strategic command.Politically, the 27th Constitutional Amendment has drawn mixed reactions. While the ruling coalition hailed it as a step towards efficiency and national security, opposition leaders warned that it concentrates excessive power in the military and could weaken democratic and provincial autonomy.",Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces.

Pak President Zardari Approves Asim Munir As The First Chief Of Defence Forces Amid Power Tensions





President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday formally appointed Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir as Pakistan’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) for a period of five years.The move follows the recent passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment on November 12, which created the post of CDF to unify command across the armed forces and streamline decision-making during critical situations.The newly created CDF replaces the abolished office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which formally ended on November 27 following the retirement of General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.President Zardari approved the recommendation submitted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for Munir’s appointment. A press release from the President’s office extended best wishes to Munir in his new role.The same release also announced a two-year extension in the service of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu, Chief of Air Staff, effective from the completion of his current tenure in March 2026.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the reforms “bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while maintaining military honour and tradition” and confirmed there were no legal or political obstacles to Munir’s appointment. He also stated that the Defence Ministry was preparing a new organogram for the CDF to reflect the changes.Field Marshal Munir, who was initially appointed as COAS in November 2022 for three years, had his tenure extended to five years in 2024.With this appointment, he assumes a historic dual role, serving simultaneously as Chief of Army Staff and the first Chief of Defence Forces, marking a significant shift in Pakistan’s military hierarchy and institutional structure.The 27th Constitutional Amendment elevates the army chief to the role of CDF with constitutional authority over all three branches of the military: army, navy and air force.It also introduces judicial reforms, including the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) to handle constitutional matters, allowing the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the amendment as a demonstration of national unity, highlighting the role of law enforcement in recent counterterrorism efforts.While the ruling coalition including PPP, PML-N, and MQM-P, supported the amendment, opposition parties criticized it as unconstitutional, warning it could concentrate excessive power in the military.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan described it as the “Baku Amendments,” accusing the government of undermining democracy. PPP Senator Raza Rabbani warned the changes could damage provincial autonomy and roll back powers devolved under the 18th Amendment, according to Dawn.Following Munir’s appointment, the next key step will be appointing the commander of the National Strategic Command (NSC), a four-star position previously under the CJCSC. The NSC commander will be appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the CDF.","President Asif Ali Zardari formally appointed Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir as Pakistan’s first Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) for a period of five years.

Rise of Rehman Dakait and the Peoples’ Aman Committee





Feuds, betrayal and the making of Uzair Baloch





Parallel governance, ‘parchi’ systems and water mafias





Several informal systems operated during this period:

The ‘Parchi’ System: Residents, businesses and even small schools were required to obtain a stamped permission slip or parchi from PAC offices to build, renovate, operate stalls or open new ventures. What looked like a routine approval process effectively served as taxation, a tool of surveillance and a means to regulate economic activity.

Water and Tanker Control: Amid persistent water shortages across Karachi, PAC factions captured key pipeline points and operated illegal hydrants. Water was sold through tankers at inflated rates, turning a basic utility into one of the most profitable sources of revenue for the gangs. Control over water distribution also gave PAC leverage over entire neighbourhoods.

Welfare Patronage and ‘Robin Hood’ Politics: A share of illicit earnings was used to sponsor madrassas, support religious events, organise football tournaments, fund community funerals and assist poor families. This welfare strategy deepened PAC’s influence and aligned it with PPP’s political base, reinforcing the perception of gang leaders as protectors rather than mere criminals.

PPP, the Bhuttos and the contested 'protector' narrative





A factual account of the events surrounding Benazir’s return and death underscores this point:

Karsaz bombing (18 October 2007): Benazir was in an open truck surrounded by PPP volunteers, not in a car. Her protection was largely handled by party workers and an informal crowd, not gang networks.

Assassination in Rawalpindi December, 27, 2007: At the time she was targeted, she was travelling in a white Toyota Land Cruiser driven by Javed Rehman, a trained PPP driver, not Rehman Dakait. No credible evidence links the gangster to her security detail.

Post-war Lyari: Quiet streets, unresolved questions









NEW DELHI: Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the “mother of Karachi” – one of the city’s oldest settlements powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football-obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets, long branded as Karachi’s “wild west.”It is this layered, contradictory Lyari that Aditya Dhar’s recent 'Dhurandhar' turns into cinema. The film revolves around characters that seem to be inspired by gangster Rehman Dakait, police officer Chaudhry Aslam and a shadowy military-intelligence player resembling Ilyas Kashmiri (fictionalised as Major Iqbal). Alongside Pakistani security figures, the narrative hints at a foreign intelligence angle featuring an unnamed “Indian spy chief” — a character with echoes of a former top security official who, in real life, has been involved in covert roles in regional conflicts in Pakistan. These references remain ambiguous on screen, but they mirror real allegations that have circulated for years through local press conferences, dossiers and counterclaims on both sides of the border.Reacting to the controversy around Dhurandhar and the a case file in Delhi high court, Major Mohit Sharma’s brother, Madhur Sharma, said the petition was filed due to ongoing speculation that the film was inspired by the Ashok Chakra awardee’s life without any transparency from the makers. Madhur clarified that the family is not opposed to a film based on Major Sharma, but objected to the possibility of using his story without consent. “We would be proud if a film is made on him. Even in 2021, a film was announced and we supported the producers. He has left a legacy, and it should live on,” he said. The family maintains that they are only seeking clarity and dignity for the officer: “There is no benefit the parents are looking for… If the film is based on him, just say, ‘Sorry ma’am, we didn’t inform you.’ If not, say the hype is untrue.”The Delhi high court heard the plea filed by Major Sharma’s parents seeking a review before the film’s release. While the court did not stay the December 5 release of Dhurandhar, it acknowledged the legitimacy of the family’s concerns regarding similarities to a real-life officer without consent. The court referred the matter to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for examination, noting the need for regulatory scrutiny before the film proceeds.Following the controversy, director Aditya Dhar issued a clarification on X addressed to the family. He wrote: “Hi, sir - our film Dhurandhar is not based on the life of braveheart Major Mohit Sharma AC(P) SM. This is an official clarification. I assure you, if we do make a biopic on Mohit sir in the future, we will do it with full consent and in complete consultation with the family, and in a way that truly honors his sacrifice for the nation and the legacy it has left for all of us. Jai Hind.”This blurred mix of fact, rumour and state narrative reflects Lyari’s history itself. For more than six decades, the neighbourhood has moved on two parallel tracks. One is a working-class community that powered Karachi’s docks, produced champion boxers and footballers, and remained a loyal base of the Pakistan People's Party ( PPP ). The other is a network of gangs and protection rackets that emerged from the hashish trade of the 1960s and later expanded into narcotics trafficking, extortion, land capture and control of water tankers.Successive governments, including PPP administrations, did not simply fight these groups; at various points they bargained with them, funded them or turned a blind eye. Leaders like Rehman Dakait, and later Uzair Baloch, acted not only as crime bosses but as political intermediaries who ran parallel governance under the banner of the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), often brandishing PPP flags at their offices. As Taliban networks poured into Karachi in the 2000s and regional intelligence rivalries spilled into the city, Lyari’s gangs were no longer seen merely as enforcers protecting a vote bank — they were gradually treated as potential pieces in a wider security chessboard.With Dhurandhar reigniting attention, this story revisits how Lyari transformed from a labour colony to PPP stronghold to a battleground shaped by gang wars, state patronage, counter-terror operations and allegations of espionage. What emerges is not simply the tale of feared men, but the story of a neighbourhood where poverty, politics and competing security agendas turned everyday life into a prolonged and violent conflict.a long, violent war.Lyari is among the oldest continuously inhabited parts of Karachi and holds a foundational place in the city’s history. Long before Karachi became Pakistan’s financial hub, Lyari evolved as a working-class settlement dominated by Baloch communities who migrated from coastal and interior regions in search of livelihoods. During the 18th and 19th centuries, as the port emerged as the centre of colonial trade, Baloch labourers became indispensable to loading cargo, building roads and supporting maritime activities. This early dependence on manual workers gradually transformed Lyari into a labour colony closely interlinked with Karachi’s industrial and infrastructural growth.Despite its importance in sustaining the city’s economy, the locality remained neglected in terms of urban development. Narrow lanes, dense housing clusters, unreliable utilities and limited state services came to define its daily reality. Yet, Lyari’s social fabric remained strong: sports, community centres and local cultural traditions created a sense of belonging that distinguished it from other Karachi neighbourhoods.In politics, Lyari’s identity further crystallised with the rise of the Pakistan People's Party. Since the 1970s, the PPP’s populist messaging—centred on economic justice and empowerment of marginalised groups—found deep resonance in Lyari. During decades of shifting political power in Karachi, the locality consistently returned PPP candidates to provincial and national assemblies. This loyalty turned Lyari into the party’s most dependable urban stronghold, a constituency where electoral victories were seldom in doubt.Over time, however, this relationship between Lyari and the PPP took a complex turn. As Karachi’s security landscape deteriorated in the 1980s and 1990s, the party increasingly relied on local strongmen, community leaders and later armed groups to maintain influence and protect its vote bank. Patronage networks developed, blurring the lines between politics, street authority and organised crime. What began as a working-class community with a vibrant political identity would eventually become the focal point of Karachi’s most violent gang conflict—one in which loyalty, power and criminality became deeply entangled.The roots of the Lyari gang war go back to the 1960s, when the area emerged as a key node in the local hashish trade. According to both journalistic and academic accounts, early figures like Dad Muhammad (“Dadal”) and his brother Sheru moved into the hashish business in the mid-1960s, challenging the dominance of an older drug boss known as “Kala Nag”.Kala Nag was eventually killed in what was officially described as a police encounter, and the hashish economy fragmented into rival factions. Violence at this stage largely revolved around knives and small arms, with public killings used to send messages and enforce territorial control.In the 1990s, a more educated generation of criminals appeared. One of the most prominent was Iqbal, known locally as “Babu Dacoit”, who reportedly held a Master’s degree in physics. Operating across a wider network, he ran drugs and other rackets while remaining largely beyond the reach of the police. His later arrest, when he was already paralysed, symbolised a shift from small-scale street crime to more organised, networked operations.A major shift in Lyari’s politics and crime landscape came with the ascent of Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, widely known as Rehman Dakait. Born into a family already linked to smuggling networks, Rehman entered the criminal world at a young age. By the mid-1990s, he had developed a reputation for extreme violence, with local accounts even alleging that he murdered his own mother during a domestic dispute—an unverified but persistent story that reinforced his notoriety.By the early 2000s, Rehman had consolidated control over large parts of Lyari’s illicit economy, including drug trafficking, extortion and gambling rackets. Yet, he also cultivated an image as a benefactor. Oral histories, media reporting and academic studies describe how he funded small clinics, madrassas, football tournaments, neighbourhood parks and schools, using criminal proceeds to build patronage. This dual identity—provider and predator—helped him secure legitimacy among segments of the local population who felt abandoned by the state.Rehman’s rise coincided with Lyari’s continued loyalty to the PPP. As political competition intensified in Karachi, PPP leaders increasingly saw strategic value in a local armed actor who could protect the party’s dominance and mobilise votes. Political alignment, according to multiple accounts, allowed Rehman to operate with greater impunity and helped formalise gang influence under a new name: the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC).Formed around 2008, the PAC presented itself as a community “peace” organisation but functioned as an institutionalised version of Rehman’s operations. It opened offices, appointed local commanders, mediated disputes, collected protection money and distributed welfare. In a context of chronic state neglect, many residents began to rely on the PAC as a parallel administration, making it one of the most powerful non-state authorities Karachi had ever seen.The roots of Lyari’s modern gang war lie in an older conflict shaped by ransom kidnappings, shifting alliances and internal betrayals. In the 1980s and 1990s, parts of Lyari’s criminal economy were dominated by a figure known as Haji Lalu, with another notorious operator, Dadal, working as one of his trusted aides. Disputes over ransom money extorted from wealthy businessmen gradually fractured this relationship. The split laid the foundation for two rival blocs: one centred on Lalu and his son, Arshad Pappu, and the other aligned with Dadal’s family, including his son, Rehman Dakait.The rivalry intensified through the 1990s. Dadal’s murder—widely believed to have been carried out by a competing gang—created a vacuum that Rehman moved to fill, initially with Lalu’s support. But a later dispute over a substantial ransom sum allegedly taken behind Rehman’s back marked the end of that partnership. The fallout turned the former allies into adversaries, cementing a bitter feud between Rehman’s camp and that of Haji Lalu and Arshad Pappu.A separate event subsequently brought an important new actor onto the scene: Uzair Jan Baloch, the son of a transport businessman, Faiz Muhammad, known locally as Mama Faizu. According to both police records and local accounts, Faizu was kidnapped and killed in 2003 by men linked to Arshad Pappu. Uzair initially attempted to seek justice through legal channels but reportedly faced threats and obstruction. Sharing a common enemy in Pappu, he turned instead toward his cousin, Rehman Dakait, joining his organisation.Over the following years, the Rehman–Uzair alliance fought a sustained war against the Pappu–Lalu network. What began as a dispute over illicit profits evolved into a violent cycle of killings, reprisals and territorial battles. By the mid-2000s, the feud had escalated into one of the deadliest urban conflicts in Karachi, with casualties running into the hundreds and paving the way for a new era of militarised gang politics.With the rise of Rehman Dakait and, later, Uzair Baloch, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) grew beyond a criminal network and evolved into a parallel governance structure in Lyari. Between roughly 2008 and 2013, researchers describe Lyari as effectively under PAC’s informal administration, with neighbourhood “commanders’’ exercising authority over small jurisdictions. These commanders managed disputes, issued permissions and collected funds in a manner that closely resembled state functions.These overlapping spheres blurred boundaries between state actors and non-state power. PAC offices routinely displayed both their own banners and PPP flags, while police operations in Lyari were often delayed, curtailed or influenced by political pressure. For a period, the PAC did not simply challenge state authority—it partially replaced it.Within Lyari, Rehman Dakait was widely viewed as being closely aligned with senior leaders of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). Journalistic reporting and local accounts repeatedly describe him as someone who maintained proximity to the Bhutto leadership and attended major PPP political events.A popular narrative in Lyari claims that Rehman “saved” former prime minister Benazir Bhutto during the 18 October 2007 Karsaz attack in Karachi, when two explosions targeted her homecoming procession. In these accounts, Rehman is portrayed as part of an informal security circle that helped her escape following the blast. The story has fuelled his “protector” image and contributed to his Robin Hood-style mystique.However, despite the narrative’s frequency in oral history, there is no independent, verifiable evidence confirming that Rehman personally rescued Benazir or served as her driver or official security guard at any point. What is more clearly documented is the broader political relationship: Lyari’s gangs and the PPP operated in a framework of mutual benefit for years, with the party relying on armed control of the constituency and the gangs receiving political space to operate.After the PPP returned to power in 2008, Rehman publicly rebranded himself as Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, presenting the Peoples’ Aman Committee as a community organisation rather than a gang body. His growing political visibility, and reported sympathies with certain Baloch nationalist circles, are believed by some analysts and residents to have contributed to his killing in a controversial police “encounter” in 2009.As media scrutiny of Lyari intensified and gang violence spread to other parts of Karachi, state pressure began to mount. At the centre of this response was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, an officer in the Crime Investigation Department (CID) known for aggressive policing tactics. Aslam cultivated a reputation as an “encounter specialist,” targeting both militant groups and organised crime. His public stance against Lyari gangs put him in direct confrontation with Rehman Dakait, who by the mid-2000s had become one of the most influential figures in Karachi’s underworld.Law enforcement records and press reports from the period describe a tense cat-and-mouse dynamic between the two men. Rehman repeatedly evaded capture; in at least two documented incidents, he escaped custody after allegedly bribing police officers. According to local media accounts and later investigations, Rehman paid select CID and jail officials to secure temporary releases or avoid charges, a practice facilitated by weak internal oversight and political protection. These incidents contributed to Aslam’s personal resolve. Journalists covering Karachi’s crime beat recall that Aslam increasingly framed the pursuit of Rehman as a matter of professional and personal credibility for the police force.On 9 August 2009, police announced that Rehman had been killed in a shootout near Steel Town, on Karachi’s outskirts. Officials claimed that Rehman and three accomplices opened fire on police and were killed in retaliatory fire. However, from the outset, rights groups and local residents questioned the official account. Activists, lawyers and researchers later described the killing as a likely extrajudicial execution, consistent with a broader pattern of “encounters” used in Karachi to bypass a slow judicial system and fragile witness protections.With Rehman removed, the gang landscape did not stabilise. Instead, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), which he had informally led, underwent a leadership transition. Within weeks, Uzair Jan Baloch was positioned as Rehman’s successor, assuming both the criminal networks and the political connections tied to PPP support. Unlike Rehman, whose authority rested heavily on personality and charisma, Uzair’s tenure was marked by greater bureaucratisation—defined commanders, more formalised extortion systems and deeper conflict with the state. This period would set the stage for some of the bloodiest episodes of the Lyari gang war.After Rehman Dakait’s killing in 2009, leadership of the Lyari network did not pass smoothly to a single successor. Uzair Jan Baloch projected himself as the political head of the organisation: educated, relatively well-spoken, and comfortable appearing alongside PPP leaders. His image contrasted sharply with the operational commander Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla”, who had a reputation for ruthlessness built over years as an enforcer in neighbourhood turf battles.Initially, the two worked side by side under the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) banner. But disagreements over extortion routes, neighbourhood control and access to political patrons gradually turned into open rivalry. Within Lyari, some commanders gravitated toward Uzair’s political authority and alleged links to provincial leadership; others aligned with Baba Ladla’s street power. This divide transformed PAC from a single entity into competing armed factions.The conflict reached its most infamous moment in March 2013, with the killing of rival gangster Arshad Pappu. According to court filings and media reporting, Pappu and his brother Yasir Arafat were abducted from Karachi’s Defence neighbourhood and taken to Lyari. Both were tortured, killed and later mutilated. Their remains were reportedly burned and dumped—widely interpreted as Uzair’s retaliation for the killing of his father, Faiz Muhammad. Some later accounts, including police dossiers and local testimonies, alleged that gang members kicked or played football with severed heads, turning the murders into a grim public spectacle that circulated in local narratives.By this stage, the greatest toll fell on ordinary residents. Prolonged firefights between splinter factions left neighbourhoods barricaded for days. Homes and small businesses were commandeered as torture rooms or lookout posts. Young men were coerced into gang recruitment, teachers and shopkeepers were forced to pay “taxes,” and ambulance workers trying to retrieve bodies were threatened by both sides. In response, the state increasingly turned to large-scale fires, sieges and heavy weaponry, culminating in the militarised crackdowns that would soon follow.In April–May 2012, the Sindh government initiated one of Karachi’s largest security actions against gang networks, later known as Operation Lyari. The police deployed thousands of personnel, armoured carriers and specialised units with the stated goal of clearing the area and arresting key commanders linked to the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). For the first time, a formal state crackdown directly targeted the network that had operated for years through political patronage and parallel governance.The operation, however, quickly encountered intense resistance. Armed groups used heavy weaponry, including rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), to attack the advancing police. Several armoured personnel carriers were damaged or destroyed, and police units struggled to push through Lyari’s dense alleyways, where snipers and lookout positions gave gang members a tactical advantage. After several days of fighting, rising casualties, and growing criticism from political circles, the operation stalled. It ended without major arrests and was widely perceived as a failure that exposed both the state’s limitations and PAC’s entrenched power.For residents, the consequences were immediate and severe. Lyari was effectively sealed off for about a week, with restricted movement in and out of the neighbourhood. Power and water supplies were disrupted, markets were shut, and families already living under economic strain faced shortages of food and basic essentials. Humanitarian groups and ambulance services reported being blocked or delayed from providing aid, amid police suspicions that relief efforts could serve as a cover to transport weapons or militants.The failed siege deepened mistrust between civilians, gangs and the state. Many residents had already endured years of coercive “taxes” and violence under PAC rule; the security operation then subjected them to collective punishment, indiscriminate fire and deprivation. Instead of restoring confidence, the crackdown reinforced the perception that both the state and the gangs were willing to sacrifice ordinary people to protect their own interests.Even as Lyari’s gang networks fought prolonged turf wars, Karachi was simultaneously becoming a logistical base for militant organisations, particularly factions of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). As security operations intensified in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt, militants sought anonymity in large urban centres. Pashtun-majority neighbourhoods such as Sohrab Goth, Manghopir and SITE became key sanctuaries and transit corridors where fighters, explosives and finances could be moved with relative ease.The turning point came on 8 June 2014, when ten militants launched an armed assault on Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, using automatic weapons, grenades and a rocket launcher. The attack triggered an overnight battle that left at least 36 people dead, including all ten assailants. The incident severely embarrassed federal authorities and exposed vulnerabilities in Karachi’s security infrastructure. The scale of the attack underscored that the city’s violence was no longer just about gangs—it was also linked to national insurgency networks.In the aftermath, the state expanded its response. The federal and provincial governments granted Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) extensive policing and detention powers to target both militants and criminal networks. These operations aligned with ongoing national counterinsurgency campaigns, including Operation Zarb-e-Azb and later Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad, which aimed to dismantle militant networks and disrupt their finances and recruitment pipelines.In Karachi, this translated into a sustained, multi-year crackdown led by the Rangers. Tactical raids, mass arrests, prolonged detentions under special legal provisions and high-profile encounters became common features of urban policing. In Lyari, the result was a shrinking space for gangs to openly control territory. The Peoples’ Aman Committee and splinter factions still operated, but their public influence diminished as armed checkpoints, displays of heavy weaponry and enforced taxation became more difficult to sustain. Although pockets of violence persisted, the crackdown marked the beginning of the end of large, overt gang administrations in the city.One of the most high-profile casualties in the post-2014 security phase was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, the police officer who had led major operations against both Lyari gangs and militant networks. On 9 January 2014, a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into Aslam’s convoy in Karachi, killing him and at least three others. The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility, calling the attack revenge for police operations against its fighters and financiers. Aslam’s death was widely perceived as a serious setback to the city’s counter-terror and anti-gang efforts, though operations continued under other police officers and with greater reliance on Pakistan Rangers (Sindh).For Lyari’s armed groups, the most decisive blow came three years later. Acting on intelligence reports, Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) launched a pre-dawn raid on 2 February 2017 in Phool Patti Lane, Lyari, targeting Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla.” According to Rangers’ statements, a gun battle lasting over 30 minutes ensued, during which gang members used automatic weapons and grenades. By the end of the raid, Rangers announced that Baba Ladla and two close associates had been killed.Listed for years among Pakistan’s “most wanted” criminals, Baba Ladla faced cases ranging from murder and extortion to armed attacks on police and suspected collaborations with extremist groups. His death effectively dismantled a key pillar of the Uzair-era structure, removing the most prominent operational commander who had challenged both rivals inside Lyari and the security forces sent to eliminate them.By the mid-2010s, as state pressure intensified and gang structures were fractured by successive operations, Uzair Jan Baloch left Pakistan. In December 2015, Interpol arrested him at Dubai International Airport, reportedly while he was travelling from Muscat. He was subsequently handed over to Pakistani authorities and brought back to Karachi.From 2016 onward, Uzair was charged in dozens of criminal cases, ranging from murder and attempted murder to extortion, kidnapping and terrorism. Many of these cases have since resulted in acquittals due to lack of evidence, hostile witnesses or procedural weaknesses—a pattern that has long characterised Karachi’s organised crime trials, where intimidation makes witness testimony difficult.In April 2017, a new dimension emerged when the Pakistan Army took custody of Uzair to try him under military law. He was accused of espionage and leaking sensitive information to a foreign intelligence agency, reportedly linked to Iran. In April 2020, a military court sentenced him to 12 years in prison on espionage charges, marking a significant shift in how the state officially characterized him—not merely as a gang leader, but as a potential national security threat.Pakistani officials and segments of local media have occasionally linked Uzair’s alleged intelligence connections to the controversial case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Indian national sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court in 2017. One strand of narrative suggests that Uzair’s alleged contacts in Iran overlapped with networks also linked to Jadhav. However, India has rejected Pakistan’s claims in the Jadhav case as coerced and unsubstantiated, and publicly verifiable evidence connecting Uzair directly to operational support for Jadhav remains limited.What is clearer is that, from the perspective of the Pakistani state, Uzair Baloch’s profile evolved from that of a gang leader embedded in local politics to an alleged cross-border security risk—reshaping the narrative around Lyari’s gangs and their significance.As violence worsened and Lyari began drawing national and even international scrutiny, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) gradually shifted its stance on the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). Between 2012 and 2013, amid pressure from rival parties, security agencies and media coverage, the PPP formally disowned the PAC, despite years of visible proximity.Senior party leaders later framed PAC figures as rogue actors or products of state neglect, arguing that they were not part of a deliberate political strategy. Critics, however—including journalists, residents and some researchers—contend that the PPP benefitted for years from PAC’s armed control of Lyari, only distancing itself once the political and reputational costs became unsustainable.This distancing reflected a broader shift: as the state redefined Lyari’s gangs from political intermediaries to security liabilities, political actors recalibrated their alliances. What had once been an informal partnership built on patronage and vote control became a liability in the age of counterterrorism and international scrutiny.Security indicators suggest that overt gang violence in Lyari has dropped sharply since the mid-2010s. Rangers-led operations, the removal or incarceration of key gang leaders such as Rehman, Uzair and Baba Ladla, and broader counter-terror campaigns have reduced the frequency of armed clashes and targeted killings in the area.The legacy of the Lyari gang war remains unfinished. For many families, the years of kidnappings, torture, blockades and forced recruitment left deep social and economic scars. Questions continue to surround extrajudicial killings, disappearances and the conduct of both the gangs and state agencies tasked with fighting them. Although large armed networks have been dismantled, traces of informal control and low-level criminality persist in new forms.At the same time, Lyari’s cultural and political identity is evolving again. The football grounds, community schools and cultural centres that once defined the neighbourhood are re-emerging, even as residents remain wary of new power brokers. In popular culture, recent portrayals such as Dhurandhar and other planned projects reflect an enduring public fascination with Lyari—its blurred boundaries between criminal groups, political actors and state security agencies, and the unanswered questions they leave behind.Seen in retrospect, the gang war was not merely the story of violent figures in a marginalised settlement. It grew out of structural inequality, weak state institutions and a political party’s reliance on armed intermediaries to protect its vote bank. As militancy and regional intelligence rivalries later intersected with local crime networks, a neighbourhood built from labour and sport became entangled in national security narratives.Lyari today is quieter, but its past continues to shape how residents understand politics, policing and protection. The names of Rehman Dakait, Uzair Baloch, Baba Ladla and Arshad Pappu remain part of local memory—sometimes condemned as criminals, sometimes recalled as flawed protectors, always as evidence of how quickly a working-class community can become a battleground when crime, politics and security policy converge.","Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the ‘mother of Karachi’ – powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football- obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets. It is this layered, contradictory Lyari that Aditya Dhar's recent 'Dhurandhar' turns into cinema.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125768364,imgsize-87724,width-400,resizemode-4/lyari-gang-war.jpg"

'Munir Is A Mentally Unstable Man': Ex-Pakistan PM Imran Khan Blames Army Chief of Fueling Terrorism





Pakistan’s jailed former prime minister Imran Khan on Wednesday launched a sharp attack on the country’s army chief and de-facto ruler Asim Munir , calling him a ""mentally unstable man."" He also claimed that field marshal Munir’s policies were ""disastrous"" for Pakistan and accused him of intentionally ""igniting tensions"" with Afghanistan.The 73-year-old former cricketer-turned-politician shared these remarks on social media a day after his sister, Dr Uzma Khan, met him in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. The meeting took place after more than a month, following “special permission” from Shehbaz Sharif ’s government, amid widespread rumours on social media about Imran’s health and safety after he was placed in solitary confinement.In a post on X written in Urdu, Khan said, “Asim Munir’s policies are disastrous for Pakistan. Because of his policies, terrorism has spiralled out of control that grieves me deeply.”He further alleged, “Asim Munir has no concern for Pakistan’s national interests. He is doing all this merely to please Western powers. He deliberately ignited tensions with Afghanistan so that he could be seen internationally as a so-called 'mujahid'.”The PTI founder said he had always opposed “drone attacks and military operations against own people in the country which he said would only fuel more terrorism.”He claimed, “Munir first threatened Afghans, then expelled refugees from Pakistan and carried out drone strikes whose consequences we now face in the form of rising terrorism.”Calling Munir a “mentally unstable man,” Khan alleged that the army chief’s “moral bankruptcy has led to the complete collapse of the Constitution and rule of law in Pakistan.”He also accused Munir of being behind the cases against him and his wife, saying they had been “imprisoned in fabricated cases and subjected to the worst form of psychological torture.”Khan described his prison conditions, saying, “I have been kept in complete solitary confinement, locked inside a cell with no contact with a single human being for four weeks. I was kept entirely cut off from the outside world, and even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been taken away from us.”He added that despite court orders, his meetings with political colleagues were stopped, and now even his access to lawyers and family had been cut off. “Pick up any human rights charter, psychological torture is considered 'torture' and is deemed even more severe than physical torture. My sister Noreen Niazi was dragged on the road simply for demanding her legitimate right to meet me,” he said.Khan praised Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi for showing courage during what he called an “environment of repression.” He wrote, “I ask him to continue to play on the front foot. There is no law or Constitution in this country. The law is enforced only against PTI as everyone else is exempt. Those threatening governor’s rule in KP should impose it today rather than tomorrow and then watch what happens to them. ”Speculation about Khan’s health had grown after an undeclared ban was imposed on meeting him. Uzma, after seeing her brother, said his health was “perfectly fine” but he was being subjected to “mental torture in solitary confinement.”“Praise be to Allah! His health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture,” she said.","Imran Khan says Asim Munir's policies are ""disastrous"" for Pakistan. He accuses Munir of intentionally ""igniting tensions"" with Afghanistan.

Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), state media reported on Wednesday.The loss-making airline is being privatised as part of a $7 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) program , which requires the federal government to reform or divest struggling state enterprises. A previous attempt to offload PIA last year was scrapped after the government failed to receive a sufficiently attractive offer.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with corporate entities and company representatives involved in the process, according to a press release shared by state broadcaster PTV News. “PIA’s bidding will take place on December 23, which will be broadcast live on all media. We are ensuring transparency and merit in the privatisation process,” the statement quoted him as saying.Sharif said the process was proceeding “smoothly” and argued that privatisation would help restore the airline’s “lost prestige,” align it with modern aviation requirements and facilitate the restoration of PIA’s global flight operations — a step he said was crucial for overseas Pakistanis.If completed, the transaction would mark Pakistan’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.Founded in October 1946, PIA is based at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, the country’s second-busiest airport and its largest city’s main aviation hub.","Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines.

NEW DELHI: Imran Khan’s sister on Tuesday said the former Pakistan prime minister is “completely fine” and in good health, after she was finally allowed to meet him inside Adiala Jail following weeks of restricted access that had fuelled protests and rumours about his condition.Authorities at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail permitted Imran’s sister Uzma Khanum to meet him on Tuesday, breaking a prolonged period during which family members and PTI leaders were repeatedly denied access. According to Pakistan news outlet Dawn, Uzma entered the prison as several PTI supporters gathered outside demanding transparency on Imran’s health.Following the meeting, PTI USA shared her remarks, quoting her as saying, “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he said that they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this.”AccordingUzma said that Imran Khan was kept in his room throughout the day, allowed only limited time outside, and had no communication with anyone.

There has been absolutely no contact with Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan , which has intensified speculation about his possible death. Demanding access to the PTI founder, party members have decided to stage a protest despite the restrictions imposed by the Pakistan government.Following the PTI workers' announcement of protests outside the Islamabad High Court and Adiala Jail, Section 144 was enforced in both cities. However, the order has not deterred Imran Khan’s supporters. They declared their protest plans even as restrictions have been in place since November 18 for two months.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday declared that the party would stage a major protest outside the Islamabad High Court on Monday, followed by another demonstration outside Adiala Jail on Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference at the CM House, Afridi claimed that Imran Khan, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, has been held in “complete isolation” since November 4, with no one granted access to him.He said that Khan’s sisters, senior party leaders, lawyers, and even doctors have all been barred from meeting him, effectively placing him in total solitary confinement—a situation he described as “extremely alarming.”PTI leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan. After KP CM Afridi ordered the party members to immediately move to Islamabad, the party has also asked the supporters to gather outside the Adiala Jail later.Talking to reporters, Afridi said that on Tuesday, all parliamentarians would first gather at the IHC to stage a strong protest before the court’s chief justice, noting that despite judicial orders, he himself was not allowed to meet Khan.“This is blatant contempt of court. We will hold a protest at the IHC,” Afridi asserted.He said the parliamentarians would then move to Adiala Jail to attempt to meet Khan and to express solidarity with his sisters.Following the announcement of protests, the Rawalpindi deputy commissioner's office issued the notice on Monday that Section 144 shall be imposed in the city from December 1 to December 3. According to the notice, the order has been enforced on the basis of “imminent threats” identified by the district intelligence committee (DIC), particularly in and around sensitive installations, major roads and other critical infrastructure. The committee’s assessment underpinned the local government’s decision to restrict public gatherings during this period.The Rawalpindi notification prohibits all kinds of gatherings of more than five people. As per the statement, ""All kinds of Assemblies, Gatherings, Sits-in, Rallies, Processions, Demonstrations, Jalsas, Dharnas, Protests and such like other activities, i.e gathering of 05 or more persons.""""Carrying of weapons, spikes, laden batons, gaulails, ball bearings, petrol bombs, improvised explosives or any other instrument that could potentially be used for violence,"" is also listed as one of the restrictions in the notice.Along with these, pillion riding and the use of loudspeakers or display of ""arms and hatred speeches"" are also prohibited.The Islamabad district magistrate’s office issued the order after what it described as “certain segments of society … planning to organise unlawful assemblies … within the jurisdiction of Islamabad Capital Territory,” according to a report in Dawn. The announcement in Rawalpindi came through a notification from the deputy commissioner’s office, which cited security concerns due to potential large gatherings.In Islamabad, the order did not define what would constitute an “unlawful assembly” but noted that authorities deemed it “necessary to control such types of illegal activities which present a threat to public peace, tranquillity and maintenance of law & order.”Pakistan’s former Prime Minister has remained completely out of sight for more than six weeks, with neither his party members nor his family able to establish any direct contact during this period. His prolonged absence from public view has intensified anxiety across the country, fuelling widespread speculation and deepening fears about his safety.The lack of verified updates or appearances has further heightened concerns, with many questioning whether the politician-turned-cricketer may have become the target of a possible assassination attempt or is otherwise being kept in undisclosed conditions.Khan’s sons fear authorities may be hiding “something irreversible” about his condition. His son, Kasim Khan, told Reuters that the family has had no direct or verifiable contact with the jailed former Prime Minister, despite a court order allowing weekly meetings.“Not knowing whether your father is safe, harmed, or even alive is psychological torture,” he said, noting that there has been no independently confirmed communication for months.“We have no reliable information about his condition,” he added. “Our deepest fear is that something irreversible is being kept from us.”Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, filed a contempt of court petition in the IHC on November 28 against the Adiala Jail superintendent and other officials, alleging they prevented her from meeting her brother.Submitting the petition in the presence of Chief Minister Afridi, she cited the IHC’s March 24 order, which had restored a twice-weekly visitation schedule for the 73-year-old former prime minister.Pakistan government officials have rejected rumours that Imran Khan has died in custody or been quietly moved out of Adiala Jail, insisting he remains inside the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.“There is no truth to claims of his transfer from Adiala Jail. He is in good health and receiving full medical care,” Geo News quoted Rawalpindi prison officials as saying.Imran Khan is currently being held in Adiala Jail, where a court first handed him a three-year prison term in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Since then, successive corruption convictions have pushed his total sentence to 14 years, the longest jail term imposed on him so far.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders have been demanding access to the party founder, Imran Khan. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi claimed that Imran Khan has been held in “complete isolation” since November 4. Khan’s sisters, senior party leaders, lawyers, and even doctors have all been barred from meeting him.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125710838,imgsize-1508415,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

‘4,000 Soldier Deaths, 20,000 Injured’: Pak FM Ishaq Dar Blames Taliban For Troop Losses

In a first, the Baloch Liberation Front (BLF) used a woman fidayeen operative to storm a heavily-guarded complex belonging to the Frontier Corps and housing a Chinese copper and gold mining project center located in Chagai, Balochistan. Six Pak personnel were reportedly killed in Sunday evening’s attack but there was no official word from the Pak authorities.The BLF also released the photo of the bomber, Zareena Rafiq aka Trang Mahoo, who detonated herself at the barrier to allow the rebel fighters to breach the main compound. The attack is significant because it is the first time the BLF has used a suicide bomber, a tactic exclusive to Majeed Brigade of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) which has carried out a series of attacks including the Jaffar Express hijack in the region.The fact that the complex was linked to the Saindak and Reko Diq projects, managed by Chinese companies and a Canadian firm, indicates the change in rebels’ strategy to strike high-value assets with geopolitical significance, sources said. In a statement released on Telegram, the BLF spokesperson Gwahram Baloch said that the Fidayeen operation was carried out by its ‘selfsacrifice’ unit, Saddo Operational Battalion (SOB), named after Martyred Commander Waja Sado aka Sadath Marri.Meanwhile the BLA released a statement on the wave of coordinated attacks carried out at multiple locations between Nov 28-29, claiming 27 Pak army personnel were killed in 29 attacks. The BLA also said it had taken control of motorways and seized weapons.BLA fighters struck the Pakistani army’s Coast Guard camp in the Pasni area of Gwadar with multiple grenade launchers. They targeted military intelligence personnel in the Jiwani area of Gwadar with a remote-controlled IED attack while they were returning after extorting money from vehicles, the BLA said. Another attack was on the residence of a Pakistani army major in Mastung city.Six blasts were reported at defence installations in Quetta as well. Meanwhile, state forces and bomb disposal squad personnel attempting to advance towards the sites were targeted in another attack resulting in further casualties.",Baloch Liberation Front (BLF) used a woman fidayeen operative to storm a heavily-guarded complex belonging to the Frontier Corps. Six Pak personnel were reportedly killed in Sunday evening’s attack but there was no official word from the Pak authorities. The attack is significant because it is the first time the BLF has used a suicide bomber.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125707623,imgsize-667815,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

Pakistan Rages At UN After Criticism Of Munir’s Immunity Amendment Amid Fears Of Deeper Militarism

Also Read |





Author and National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) member Tilak Devasher claimed that Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is “intentionally” staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces (CDF).Created through the 27th amendment to Pakistan’s constitution, the post is set to be assumed by Field Marshal Asim Munir, potentially making him the most powerful army chief in the country’s history.Speaking to ANI, Devasher highlighted that Sharif left for Bahrain and then London, leading to speculation that he's ""deliberately"" staying away to avoid issuing the notification.“Very smartly, the Pakistan PM went to Bahrain and then to London. He clearly does not want to issue the notification giving Asim Munir five years as army chief and as Chief of Defence Forces. He seems to believe that by staying away and avoiding signing the notification, he can escape the consequences,” said Devasher, author of four books on Pakistan.The comment comes after Sharif’s government failed to issue the required notification appointing Munir as the first-ever CDF by the November 29 deadline—the day his original three-year term as army chief ended.With the creation of the CDF post, the office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee has formally been abolished.Devasher added that Pakistan is currently navigating a “very messy” situation.“If it turns out that he (Asim Munir) is no longer the army chief, then Pakistan finds itself without an army chief, and even the nuclear command authority—meant to fall under the new Strategic Forces Command—is effectively leaderless. It’s an extremely strange situation,” he remarked.Legal experts remain divided over whether the notification is necessary. Under the amended Constitution, the Chief of Army Staff’s term is meant to run concurrently with the CDF, lasting five years.Some analysts, however, argue that the issue may already be addressed by the Pakistan Army Act’s 2024 amendment, which extended the tenure of service chiefs to five years, according to Dawn. The amendment includes a “deeming” clause stating it “shall always be deemed to have been part of the Pakistan Army Act,” implying that Munir’s current term could automatically extend from three to five years without any additional notification.Devasher, however, called this interpretation “controversial,” questioning the view that a notification may not be required.“Some people argue that the Army Act was amended in 2004, setting the army chief’s tenure at five years. Since he has already served three, he supposedly has another two years remaining. From this perspective, no new notification would be required. This is controversial, and it’s unclear how the judiciary or the government will view it. But the fact remains that it makes his position very tenuous,” Devasher said.He also pointed to what he described as political manoeuvring within the military. “There are reports that other generals are now jostling for the position of army chief or for the two newly created four-star posts,” he stated.Devasher added that Prime Minister Sharif’s absence is only deepening the uncertainty. “But this situation cannot continue,” he warned. “A nuclear-armed country cannot function without a Chief of the Army Staff or someone in charge of the nuclear command authority.”","Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is ""intentionally"" staying out of the country to avoid being present when the notification would be issued for the appointment of the first-ever Chief of Defence Forces.

Pakistan Army General Warns Of Hybrid-To-Full War As Pakistan Reshapes Military Power Under Munir





Fresh violence broke out in Pakistan after a suicide bomber detonated himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan, sparking an intense exchange of fire and a major security response, Dawn reported.The attack, claimed to be the work of militants described by officials as Fitna-al-Khawarij — the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — triggered a swift retaliatory operation in which three attackers were killed.According to FC Balochistan South, the assault began when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance, allowing several armed militants to force their way into the compound. Security personnel from the quick response force immediately engaged the attackers, with heavy gunfire reported from the area. Officials said at least six gunmen were believed to have entered the headquarters, prompting a full-scale clearance operation that continued through the day.In a statement, the FC spokesperson said troops were determined to neutralise the remaining threat, adding that the “last of the terrorists will also be” dealt with.Local reports described sustained firing inside the headquarters as forces worked room-to-room to secure the facility.The incident comes just days after a similar assault on an FC compound in the northwestern city of Peshawar, where gunmen and two suicide bombers stormed a paramilitary headquarters, killing three people. Police had said the first bomber detonated at the main entrance while the second entered the compound, forcing law enforcement to cordon off the busy FC Chowk area amid multiple explosions.These attacks form part of a broader escalation in militant violence this year. Earlier attacks in Quetta — including a deadly car bomb outside a paramilitary base and a suicide blast at a political rally — have added to growing instability in Balochistan. The province has endured a long-running insurgency, with hundreds of security personnel killed in 2024 alone, alongside attacks claimed by separatist groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army.","Suicide bomber detonates himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan.

Pakistan Army General Warns Of Hybrid-To-Full War As Pakistan Reshapes Military Power Under Munir





At least seven explosions were reported in Pakistan’s Balochistan province over the past 24 hours, with suspected insurgents targeting sites in Quetta and Dera Murad Jamali. No casualties were reported, although two security guards with a construction company were injured in the attacks.The incidents triggered fear and panic in the provincial capital.On Saturday, insurgents hurled hand grenades at a police checkpoint in Quetta, followed by the detonation of an IED near an Anti-Terrorism Department vehicle. Three additional explosions took place later in the evening, as cited by PTI.Senior Superintendent of Police Asif Khan said the blast near Lohr Karez, on the outskirts of Quetta, damaged the main line connecting the city with other parts of the country.SSP Khan said the attackers had planted IEDs on a railway track and detonated them as a train was scheduled to arrive at Quetta station. The blast damaged the track and forced the suspension of rail services.Khan added that armed men also attacked a construction company site on Quetta’s Sariab Road with hand grenades, damaging machinery and injuring two security guards. In another incident, motorcycle-borne insurgents hurled two hand grenades at the Manzoor Shaheed police station, one of which exploded while the other was defused by a bomb disposal squad.In Dera Murad Jamali, a patrolling police vehicle was targeted with hand grenades.Attackers also threw hand grenades in the Kech Beg area near a police patrol post in Quetta.No group immediately claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attacks, but insurgent activity resumed on Sunday morning.Earlier this year, at least ten people were killed and several others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside the paramilitary headquarters in Quetta.On September 3, a suicide bombing at a political rally in the city killed 11 people and wounded more than 40, targeting a stadium parking area where hundreds of Balochistan National Party supporters had gathered.Pakistani forces continue to battle a longstanding insurgency in Balochistan, which has claimed 782 lives in 2024. In March, the Baloch Liberation Army hijacked a train and killed off-duty troops. Since January, more than 430 people, most of them security personnel, have been killed in various attacks, including six soldiers in Bannu.","At least seven explosions reported in Pakistan's Balochistan province over the past 24 hours.

Brazening it out, Pakistan on Sunday dismissed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk’s concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment, urging him to avoid remarks that reflect “political bias and misinformation. ”“Like all parliamentary democracies, all legislation as well as any amendment to the constitution remain the exclusive domain of the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan. While Pakistan gives due importance to the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the statement issued,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement.The FO added that Pakistan remains “fully committed to protecting, promoting and upholding human rights, human dignity, basic freedoms and the rule of law as enshrined in the constitution”.“It is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the remarks. We urge the High Commissioner to respect the sovereign decisions of Pakistan's parliament and avoid commentary that reflects political bias and misinformation,"" it stated.In a statement on Friday, Türk criticised Islamabad for adopting the amendment without “broad consultation” with legal experts and civil society, warning that the “hastily adopted” changes could undermine judicial independence and raise questions about military accountability.The 27th amendment has stirred intense political debate within the neighbouring nation. On November 12, a joint parliamentary committee of the Senate and National Assembly approved the bill , prompting the opposition to warn that the government was sounding “the death knell for the Supreme Court”.The amendment alters Article 243 by abolishing the post of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and replacing it with a new Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). It also proposes establishing a Federal Constitutional Court and reducing certain powers of the Supreme Court.The first CDF will be Asim Munir, the Pakistan Army chief who was “promoted” to the five-star Field Marshal rank following the conflict with India in May.According to Dawn, the Pakistan government is yet to notify the appointment of the CDF, even as the office of the CJCSC formally ended on Thursday.",Pakistan dismisses UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk's concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment.

She was moved to the coronary care unit (CCU) four days later due to deteriorating health complications.""The medical board has unanimously decided that she will be taken to London via the Qatar Royal Air Ambulance, either after midnight tonight or early tomorrow morning,"" Hossain announced outside the hospital.Whilst Hossain, a BNP standing committee member, refrained from detailed comments about Zia's current condition.At Tuesday's briefing, he had noted her positive response to treatment. The decision for urgent transfer was made by an expanded medical board, including recently arrived specialists from China and the United Kingdom.The BNP released a list of 14 accompanying individuals, including Syeda Shameela Rahman, widow of Zia's younger son Arafat Rahman, six doctors, party adviser Enamul Haque Chowdhury, two Special Security Force (SSF) agents from Muhammad Yunus' interim government, and personal assistants.Qatar offered their air ambulance service whilst military and air force helicopters conducted rooftop landing tests at the hospital.

The sensitivity of this matter also limits the scope for detailed explanation,"" he stated.Rahman has resided in London since 2008, previously facing various legal charges. In 2024, Yunus' government withdrew these cases, with courts issuing revised acquittals.Government advisers have assured his safe return. Foreign adviser Touhid Hossain confirmed readiness to process travel documents, though no requests had been received through Wednesday evening.Nationwide prayer gatherings are being held across Bangladesh, including Dhaka, Jhenaidah, Sunamganj, Bagerhat, Cumilla, Chuadanga and Munshiganj, for Zia's recovery.","Former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia to be flown to London for specialist treatment.

FULL PRESSER: Karoline Leavitt Blames Democrats’ ‘RIDICULOUS Gimmicks’ For Mayhem At US Airports





WASHINGTON: The US government shutdown entered its 35th day on Tuesday, matching a record set during Donald Trump's first presidency, as his administration warned of potential chaos at airports going into one of the busiest travel periods of the year.The federal closure appears almost certain to become the longest in history, with no major breakthroughs expected before it goes into its sixth week at midnight -- although there were fragile signs in Congress that an off-ramp was closer than ever.The government has been grinding to a halt since Congress failed to approve funding past September 30, and pain has been mounting as welfare programs -- including aid that helps millions of Americans afford groceries -- hang in limbo.About 1.4 million federal workers, from air traffic controllers to park wardens, have been placed on enforced leave without pay or made to work for nothing.The Trump administration sounded the alarm Tuesday over turmoil at airports nationwide if the shutdown drags into a sixth week, worsening staff shortages, snarling airport lines and closing down sections of airspace.""So if you bring us to a week from today, Democrats, you will see mass chaos...You will see mass flight delays,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told a news conference in Philadelphia.""You'll see mass cancelations, and you may see us close certain parts of the airspace, because we just cannot manage it because we don't have the air traffic controllers.""Thanksgiving air travel is expected to set a new record this year, the AAA projected -- with 5.8 million people set to fly domestically over the November 27 holiday.More than 60,000 air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers are working without pay, and the White House has warned that increasing absenteeism could mean chaos at check-in lines.Airport workers calling in sick rather than working without pay -- leading to significant delays -- was a major factor in Trump bringing an end to the 2019 shutdown, the joint-longest alongside the current stoppage.Some lawmakers are hoping a slew of elections taking place in New York, Virginia, New Jersey and California on Tuesday will provide the momentum they need to reopen the government.But both sides remain dug in over the main sticking point -- health care spending.- 'Defiance' -Democrats say they will only provide votes to end the funding lapse after a deal has been struck to extend expiring insurance subsidies that make health care affordable for millions of Americans.But Republicans insist they will only address health care once Democrats have voted to switch the lights back on in Washington.While both sides' leadership have shown little appetite for compromise, there have been signs of life on the back benches, with a handful of moderate Democrats working to find an escape hatch.A separate bipartisan group of four centrist House members unveiled a compromise framework Monday for lowering health insurance costs.Democrats believe that millions of Americans seeing skyrocketing premiums as they enroll onto health insurance programs for next year will pressure Republicans into seeking compromise.But Trump has held firm on refusing to negotiate, telling CBS News in an interview broadcast Sunday that he would ""not be extorted.""The president has sought to apply his own pressure to force Democrats to cave, by threatening mass layoffs of federal workers and using the shutdown to target progressive priorities.Last week, his administration threatened to cut off a vital aid program that helps 42 million Americans pay for groceries for the first time in its more than 60-year history, before the move was blocked by two courts.Trump nevertheless insisted Tuesday -- in apparent defiance of the court orders -- that the food aid would be disbursed only after the government shutdown ends.The White House later clarified, however, that it was ""fully complying"" with its legal obligations and was working to get partial SNAP payments ""out the door as much as we can and as quickly as we can.""","The US government shutdown entered its 35th day on Tuesday, matching a record set during Donald Trump's first presidency.

'American Dream Stolen': India in the Spotlight as Trump’s H-1B Visa Misuse Ad Sparks Controversy

Who is Bankim Brahmbhatt





What is the case against him





Where is Bankim Brahmbhatt now





What next





American investment giant BlackRock has accused Bankim Brahmbhatt, the Indian-origin CEO of US-based telecom companies Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice, of multi-million-dollar fraud, The Wall Street Journal reported.Lenders, including HPS Investment Partners - the private credit arm of BlackRock - have accused Brahmbhatt’s firms of fabricating accounts receivable that were used as collateral for loans. The lenders now claim to be owed over $500 million. Brahmbhatt’s lawyer told WSJ that his client disputed the fraud allegations.Bankim Brahmbhatt is the founder, president and CEO of Bankai Group, a US-headquartered telecommunications and fintech company.In interviews with Entrepreneur Middle East and Industry Chronicle, Brahmbhatt described himself as a telecom engineer turned entrepreneur, who began his journey in 1989 by setting up a push-button telephone manufacturing unit in India. Over the years, his ventures expanded into satellite dishes, telecom billing, and digital financial solutions.Bankai Group’s flagship product, MobiFin Elite, provides digital financial services and has been implemented by clients across several countries, particularly in Africa.Brahmbhatt often spoke about his vision to create a self-sustaining ecosystem for carriers, operators, and financial institutions, combining “technical skills and people skills.”His LinkedIn profile which earlier has sizable followers appears to have deactivated.According to WSJ, HPS began lending to a financing arm linked to Brahmbhatt’s companies in September 2020, later expanding its exposure to about $430 million by August 2024, with BNP Paribas helping finance the loans.Trouble surfaced in July 2024, when an HPS employee discovered that some customer emails appeared to come from fake domains imitating real telecom firms. When questioned, Brahmbhatt reportedly assured HPS officials there was nothing to worry about, before stopping all communication.Subsequent checks by accounting firm CBIZ and law firm Quinn Emanuel, hired by the lenders, found that emails and invoices provided as proof of receivables were falsified, the report said. A Belgian telecom company, BICS, confirmed to investigators that it had no connection to the emails used by Brahmbhatt’s firms, calling it a “confirmed fraud attempt.”Court filings allege that fraudulent customer contracts dated back to 2018 and that assets pledged as collateral were transferred to offshore accounts in India and Mauritius.Brahmbhatt’s companies - Broadband Telecom, Bridgevoice, Carriox Capital II, and BB Capital SPV - filed for bankruptcy in August, the same month lenders sued. BNP Paribas also reported adding €190 million (around $220 million) in loan-loss provisions linked to a “specific credit situation,” though it did not name the borrower.HPS has told clients it believes Brahmbhatt is currently in India. A person who visited the New York offices of his companies in July found them closed and vacant, the WSJ report said.Brahmbhatt also filed for personal bankruptcy on August 12, the same day his companies sought Chapter 11 protection.Despite the scale of the alleged fraud, sources told WSJ that the incident represents only a small portion of HPS’s $179 billion in assets under management and is unlikely to materially affect BlackRock’s overall performance.While the US courts are now handling the bankruptcy proceedings and civil lawsuits, Brahmbhatt has denied these allegagtions and is missing. The full scope of the alleged fraud and its potential impact on BlackRock’s private credit arm and BNP Paribas remains under investigation.","Bankim Brahmbhatt is the Indian-origin CEO of US-based telecom companies Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice.

Visit Your Branch or App: You will apply for the Ma’al Card directly through your bank either by visiting your local branch or applying via your bank's mobile application or website, just as you would for any other card.

Choose Your Card Type: The Ma'al system supports multiple products, so you can specify whether you need a debit card (linked to your current account), a credit card, or a prepaid card.

Who is eligible to get the Ma’al Card?

Does the Ma’al Card work internationally?





The days of relying solely on international payment giants are ending in the Sultanate. Driven by the Central Bank of Oman (CBO), major local banks are launching the ""Ma'al"" Card, a groundbreaking national payment card designed to bring financial independence, unmatched cost savings, and a strong sense of Omani ownership to every digital transaction.For citizens and local businesses alike, the Ma'al Card meaning ""wealth"" or ""money"" in Arabic is set to transform your wallet, promising zero issuance fees for customers and significantly reduced transaction costs for merchants, marking a monumental step forward for the goals of Oman Vision 2040.Oman payment card explainedThe Maal card is the Central Bank of Oman’s (CBO) national payment card brand, created to run on the Sultanate’s domestic payment network (OmanNet). The name, which simply means ""money"" or ""wealth"" in Arabic, signals a significant shift towards national pride and control in the financial sector. For decades, Omani banks have relied heavily on international networks for payment cards.The Ma'al Card is set to change this by creating a robust, independent national payment system. This move strengthens Oman’s financial infrastructure, keeps transaction data secure within the country, and aligns perfectly with the economic goals of Oman Vision 2040.It will include debit, prepaid, credit, corporate and premium card types so people and businesses can pay at shops, withdraw cash, pay online, and use government e-services within Oman’s payment ecosystem.The launch of the Ma'al Card brings excellent news for every Omani, especially when it comes to saving money. The CBO has confirmed two crucial benefits designed to promote widespread usage and support the local economy:The CBO plans to offer a full range of products under the Ma'al brand, including debit, credit, payment, and prepaid cards, giving you total flexibility.Since the Ma'al Card is a brand-new national system, the application process will be simple and based on the established practices of your local bank. While the official launch date has not yet been announced, here is what you need to know:The key step for now is to follow the announcements from the Central Bank of Oman and the participating local banks.The Ma’al Card is designed to be the primary card for the entire country, meaning eligibility will be broad and tied to holding a bank account in Oman. All Omani citizens with a valid bank account at a participating institution will be eligible to apply. While the card primarily strengthens the national system, it is being rolled out by commercial banks. Therefore, legal residents of Oman (expatriates who hold a valid Residence Card/ID) who maintain a bank account with a participating local bank are expected to be eligible for the card.Since the Ma'al Card is intended to be a replacement for locally-issued cards currently relying on foreign networks, any customer who can currently receive a debit or credit card from a local Omani bank should be eligible for the Ma'al equivalent.Initially, the Ma'al Card is focused on strengthening domestic payments within the Sultanate of Oman. At the time of its initial rollout, the Ma'al Card will be primarily valid for domestic use via the existing national network, OmanNet. This includes POS (point-of-sale) payments, ATM withdrawals, and e-commerce transactions within Oman.The CBO has stated that plans are underway to enable Ma'al Card acceptance across the GCC countries through a connection with the regional network, GCCNet.There is potential for future international acceptance through bilateral agreements, but this will be a later phase.In simple terms: Use it confidently everywhere in Oman. For immediate travel outside of Oman, you may still need a card that uses a major international network (like Visa or Mastercard) until the GCCNet integration is complete.","The Ma'al Card is being rolled out by a group of six local banks.

'I saw tower collapse in diagonal way': Eye witness









A worker, who had been rescued from the rubble of the collapsed medieval Torre dei Conti in central Rome, died, Italian news outlet Corriere della Sera reported after midnight on Tuesday.Crowds had cheered when emergency services freed him on Monday evening, but crews, who worked through the night amid the risk of further collapses, were unable to save him.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni named the man as Octay Stroici in a statement after midnight, saying ""she shares deep sorrow and condolences, on behalf of myself and the government, for the tragic loss"".""We are close to his family and colleagues at this time of unspeakable suffering,"" she added.Another worker was seriously injured when the Torre dei Conti collapsed twice on Monday during renovation work.Italy’s national fire department spokesman Luca Cari said one worker was in hospital in a critical condition, while three other workers were pulled out unharmed.Hundreds of tourists watched firefighters use a mobile ladder to reach the upper level of the 29-metre (95 ft) tower, where the man had been trapped by the first collapse sometime before noon.During the rescue attempt, another part of the structure collapsed, sending a cloud of debris over the area and forcing firefighters to retreat. Large clouds of dust filled the square, accompanied by the sound of falling masonry.The tower remained standing but suffered significant internal damage.Gelato shop worker Queen Paglinawan, 27, said she heard two loud noises in quick succession. She said: ""I was working and then I heard some like falling, and then I saw the tower collapse in a diagonal way.""German student Viktoria Braeu, 18, said: ""We were just at the Colosseum … and we were just walking to get some food. ... And then we were like, 'It's probably not long until it's going to go down,' and then it just started erupting.'""No firefighters were injured. A drone was flown up to check the condition of the trapped worker.Rome city authorities said the Torre dei Conti, also known as the Tower of the Counts, has not been used since 2006 and was undergoing a four-year renovation project due to end next year.The surrounding area on Via dei Fori Imperiali had been closed off to pedestrians during the work. The tower, built in 1238 by Pope Innocent III for his family, was originally twice as high but was scaled down after damage from earthquakes in the 14th and 17th centuries.","Italian PM Giorgia Meloni named the man as Octay Stroici in a statement after midnight.

Trump claims his test results were 'perfect'









White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt found herself under pressure on Tuesday when reporters repeatedly asked why President Donald Trump had undergone an MRI during a recent visit to Walter Reed Military Medical Center last week.Leavitt offered little clarity, saying only that she would “check back,” while insisting the president remained in “optimal physical health.”The questions came after the 79-year-old MAGA chief revealed last week that he had undergone both an MRI and a cognitive test during a visit to the military hospital. The disclosure came just six months after his annual physical in April.During the briefing, CNN’s Kristen Holmes asked, “Why did President Trump get an MRI during his recent visit to Walter Reed?” Leavitt responded that the visit had been a “follow-up appointment” and repeated that the president was in “optimal physical health.”When Holmes pressed further, noting that an MRI is ""a very specific procedure"" and not typically part of a routine exam, Leavitt repeated, “I’ll check back for you,” before moving on to another question.Trump first mentioned the scan himself while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Japan. “We had an MRI, MRI and the machine, you know, the whole thing, and it was perfect,” he said, later directing reporters to ask his doctors for details.Concerns over the president’s health have lingered for months. Photos showing bruises on his hands and swelling in his ankles have raised questions about his condition. The White House attributed the bruising to frequent handshakes and Trump’s routine aspirin use, and said the swelling was caused by chronic venous insufficiency, a common ailment in older adults.

Top Indian American immigration attorney hails Trump’s H-1B reforms; calls it ‘light over darkness’ for international students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/top-indian-american-immigration-attorney-hails-trumps-h-1b-reforms-as-light-over-darkness-for-international-students/articleshow/125096189.cms,"Indian Workers Face New Challenge as US Tightens Work Visa Rules Amid Crackdown on H-1B Abuse





Recent reforms to the H-1B visa system will benefit international students rather than restrict them, according to prominent Indian American immigration attorney Aparna Dave.Speaking at the “Diaspora at the Crossroads: Law, Policy and Opportunities” conference in Bethesda, Maryland, earlier this week, Dave said the new executive orders from the Trump administration mark a positive shift for those pursuing education and skilled employment in the United States, reports New India Abroad.Dave explained that revisions to the H-1B lottery and allocation process, which now prioritise graduates with advanced U.S. degrees, have created more opportunities for students finishing their studies in America. She described the changing visa regulations as “light over darkness” for those chasing the American dream through education and work pathways.Under the updated policy, which took effect in September 2025 following a presidential proclamation on H-1B reforms, international students with master’s or doctoral degrees from US institutions are more likely to be selected in the visa process.The administration has said this approach aims to retain talent already trained in American universities, encouraging highly skilled graduates to remain in the country.However, the new system also brings higher filing costs and stricter employer requirements, which could impact smaller companies. Recent rules have raised H-1B petition fees to around USD 100,000 for some employers, alongside new wage guidelines intended to favour high-skilled roles.The MAGA administration has defended the reforms as a long-term investment in America’s innovation economy, saying the system will now “reward merit, not manipulation.” Supporters argue that prioritising advanced US degree holders will reduce visa misuse and ensure that only the most qualified candidates are selected. Critics, however, warn that the steep rise in fees and compliance costs could limit diversity in the tech workforce by sidelining smaller firms and startups that rely on global talent. Immigration experts believe the true impact of these reforms will become clearer once the next H-1B lottery cycle begins in early 2026.","Recent reforms to the H-1B visa system will benefit international students, says prominent Indian American immigration attorney Aparna Dave.

‘JUST IGNORE HIM!’: Zohran Mamdani ‘HUMILIATES’ Trump As He Casts Ballot In NYC Mayoral Election

Mamdani’s record and the Israel debate





In a sharp escalation ahead of New York’s mayoral election, US President Donald Trump called Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani a “self-professed Jew hater,” adding that “any Jewish person who votes for him is stupid.” The remarks, posted on Trump’s Truth Social account just as voting began, have injected fresh controversy into a closely watched race already marked by tensions over religion, identity, and foreign policy views.Trump’s post came as New Yorkers cast ballots in an election that could make Mamdani — a 34-year-old Muslim lawmaker and democratic socialist — the city’s first Muslim mayor. The city is home to the country’s largest Jewish and Muslim communities, adding further significance to the contest.The president has repeatedly criticised Mamdani over recent months, calling him “a communist” and “a total nutjob,” while questioning his views on Israel and national security. On the eve of the election, Trump took the unusual step of endorsing independent candidate Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic governor, instead of Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa — a decision that underscored his desire to prevent a Mamdani victory.In his Truth Social post, Trump accused Mamdani of “hating Israel” and said Jewish voters who support him were “betraying their own community.”Mamdani, who represents Queens in the New York State Assembly, has faced criticism for his views on Israel and Palestine. He has argued that Israel should not exist as a specifically Jewish state and has spoken in support of Palestinian rights. He was also criticised for not initially condemning the slogan “globalise the intifada,” though he later said he would discourage its use.","US President Donald Trump called Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani a “self- professed Jew hater,’ adding that “any Jewish person who votes for him is stupid” The remarks, posted on Trump’s Truth Social account just as voting began, have injected fresh controversy into a closely watched race.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125095981,imgsize-82758,width-400,resizemode-4/39any-jew-who-votes-for39-donald-trump-attacks-zohran-mamdani-ahead-of-nyc-polls.jpg"

' Hot Girls for Zohran '









Former New York City mayor Bill de Blasio has openly backed mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani , casting his vote while wearing a “Hot Girls for Zohran” T-shirt.De Blasio shared a smiling photo of himself at the polling station and posted on X: “One of the happiest votes I ever cast! What a beautiful day for NYC!”Meanwhile, Donald Trump made a scathing remark about New York’s future leadership in his recent CBS' 60 Minutes interview, criticising the possibility of Mamdani leading the city. The president warned that New York could risk losing federal support, noting that the city currently receives $7.4 billion in federal funding.Trump dismissed Mamdani as a “communist,” saying, “If you have a communist running New York, all you’re doing is wasting the money you’re sending there.” The remarks have fuelled speculation about whether Trump’s administration would actually move to restrict funding and send National Guard in the Blue region, like he did previously with other Democratic strongholdsBill de Blasio was the 109th mayor of New York City, serving from 2014 to 2021 as a Democrat. He built his image around progressive causes, pushing for affordable housing, early childhood education, and police reform. Before his time as mayor, he worked as a political organiser and later as the city’s public advocate. Though his tenure ended with criticism over public safety and his handling of the pandemic, de Blasio remains active in local politics. His recent support for Zohran Mamdani shows that he still identifies with New York’s progressive movement and its shifting political base.The campaign slogan “Hot Girls for Zohran” has become a viral grassroots movement supporting Zohran Mamdani, the progressive New York mayoral candidate. What began as a cheeky slogan on T-shirts and social media has turned into a creative force for mobilisation, blending humour with activism. The phrase redefines “hot” to mean politically aware and socially engaged, resonating strongly with younger voters. The group behind it has helped organise events and sell merchandise at campaign pop-ups, turning a playful idea into a statement of identity.","Bill de Blasio was the 109th mayor of New York City, serving from 2014 to 2021 as a Democrat.

US transport secretary Sean Duffy on Tuesday warned that if the government shutdown continues for another week, it will disrupt air travel by worsening staff shortages, causing long queues at airports and forcing the closure of parts of US airspace.""So if you bring us to a week from today, Democrats, you will see mass chaos...

Public services continue to be affected as Trump’s Republicans and Democrats remain unable to reach an agreement.More than 60,000 air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) staff are currently working without pay. The White House has warned that rising absenteeism among staff could lead to delays at airport security checkpoints.During the 2019 shutdown, one of the two longest shutdowns at 35 days, similar staff shortages and sick calls from airport workers were a key factor in ending the standoff.In the latest effort to reopen the government, a House-approved resolution failed again in the Senate on Tuesday, marking the 14th rejection.Democrats say reopening the government requires negotiation led by Trump on their demand to extend subsidies that help millions of Americans afford health insurance.

Did Israel kill Charlie Kirk? Owens weighs in



Conspiracy theories







Conservative commentator Candace Owens has accused Donald Trump ’s team of showing little to no interest in the investigation into Charlie Kirk ’s death, while doubling down on her claim that Israel was involved in the conservative leader’s assassination, according to the Independent.Owens is a long-time ally of the late Turning Point USA founder, who was assassinated by a sniper bullet in September. She has repeatedly pushed the theory since Kirk’s death.In a post on X, Owens claimed that the MAGA administration is “hosting public auditions” to fill Kirk’s place and that the public can see it happening.On her podcast this week, she took aim at Trump and the Republican establishment. “I know spiritually, from the moment Charlie Kirk passed, that we were never going to get the full story from officials,” she said, adding that the Trump administration’s silence was due to the “pro-Israel lobby.”Owens slammed Trump for posting an “AI-generated photo” of himself with Kirk and the Star of David in the background, claiming it was proof the investigation had stalled.“Find me just one person with a platform who is pro-Israel who says ‘I want the investigation into [Kirk’s] death to continue,’” she said. “It’s a bit weird right? Dog’s very silent right now and there’s steak on the ground and they’re not moving.”The influencer also condemned Trump’s move to declare a national day of remembrance for Kirk, arguing it was an attempt to close the case.“I think it’s crap. It’s never good when the feds are lining up to give you a holiday. Martin Luther King, Jr. vibes. I definitely think the feds killed Martin Luther King Jr … I don’t like it. The best way to honour Charlie Kirk is to figure out who killed him.”Owens has previously faced accusations of antisemitism, particularly after she was suspended from YouTube in 2023 for re-uploading a 2022 interview with Kanye West in which he claimed “Jewish people control the media.”Her latest comments resulted in the birth of more conspiracy theories surrounding Kirk’s death, with Owens and fellow conservative Tucker Carlson suggesting Israel suppressed information about the case. They argue that Kirk, before his death, had begun to question Israel’s influence over US politics.Owens further alleged that Kirk told her he had been threatened by Israeli officials and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. Both Ackman and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have denied her claims.","Owens is a long-time ally of the late Turning Point USA founder, who was assassinated by a sniper bullet in September.

US Expert’s Big Reveal





US Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi slammed vice president JD Vance for his recent comments about his wife’s Hindu background, saying they contribute to a growing atmosphere of prejudice and anti-Hindu sentiment in the United States.“At a time when Hindu and Indian-American communities are confronting a climate of rising prejudice, talk of mass deportations, and growing anti-Hindu sentiment even against members of his own party, it's deeply disappointing that the Vice President would add to that climate through his recent comments while remaining silent in the face of hate,” Krishnamoorthi said on X.Vance, who is married to Indian-American Usha Vance, made some controversial remarks during a public event at the University of Mississippi. Vance said he hoped Usha turned to Christianity and claimed that her Hindu background stems from ""not a particularly religious family.""Responding to a question about his interfaith marriage, he said, “Now, most Sundays, Usha will come with me to church. As I've told her, and as I've said publicly, and as I'll say now in front of 10,000 of my closest friends, do I hope, eventually, that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved by in church? Yeah, I honestly do wish that because I believe in the Christian gospel and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way.He added, “But if she doesn't, then God says everybody has free will, and so that doesn't cause a problem for me. That's something you work out with your friends, with your family, with the person that you love.”Vance converted to Catholicism in 2019, describing Usha’s background, saying, “My wife did not grow up Christian. I think it's fair to say that she grew up in a Hindu family, but not a particularly religious family in either direction.”His comments stirred a row. Canadian journalist Ezra Levant called them “disgusting” and accused Vance of disrespecting his wife’s faith. “It's weird to throw your wife's religion under the bus, in public, for a moment's acceptance by groypers,” Levant wrote on X.Vance fired back, saying critics were twisting his words and that he loves his wife with all his heart. “My wife is the most amazing blessing I have in my life,” he wrote. “She is not a Christian and has no plans to convert... I hope she may one day see things as I do. Regardless, I'll continue to love and support her.”","US Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi slammed vice president JD Vance for his recent comments about his wife’s Hindu background.

Indian-origin MAGA supporter Dinesh D’Souza has sparked outrage online after comparing Zohran Mamdani ’s possible mayoral victory in New York City to the September 11 terrorist attacks.In a post on X, the right-wing commentator wrote, “We didn’t see 9/11 coming and when we did it was too late. We’ve seen this guy coming for a while. The result will be no less catastrophic. ”D’Souza’s remark came in response to betting site Polymarket’s latest prediction, which placed Democratic socialist Mamdani as the clear favourite with 92% odds, compared to 8% for Andrew Cuomo.Internet users were enraged by D’Souza's remarks, calling him a propagandist and a racist. Netizens pointed out the irony of a Christian Indian-origin commentator attacking a Muslim Indian-origin who is aspiring to enter politics — something they said he should be proud of. Many added that D’Souza’s attitude showed how deeply “white privilege” had influenced him.Mamdani is a 33-year-old state assemblyman of Ugandan-Indian descent, has become a political sensation with his anti-billionaire, pro-worker platform and calls to “tax the rich.” His rise has rattled conservatives and business elites alike, including figures like Elon Musk, who earlier claimed that Mamdani’s name appeared twice on the city’s ballot.Anti-MAGA supporters said D’Souza’s post shows the rising panic within MAGA circles over the idea of a socialist taking charge of America’s largest city.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment





The Pakistan government announced plans to introduce the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which includes proposed changes related to the command of the armed forces. The amendment will be tabled in Parliament soon, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar confirmed on Tuesday.“Of course, the government is bringing it and will bring it … the 27th Amendment will arrive … and is about to arrive. We will try that it be tabled in accordance with principles, laws and the Constitution,” Dar said in the Senate, as quoted by PTI.According to sources, the proposed amendment includes provisions to set up a constitutional court, streamline the process for appointing the chief election commissioner, amend Article 243 dealing with matters of the armed forces, reduce the provinces’ share in federal resources, and transfer control of the education and population welfare ministries from provinces to the federal government.Article 243 of the Constitution states that “the federal government shall have control and command of the armed forces.” The proposal to revise this article is being viewed as a move that could further strengthen the position of Army Chief General Asim Munir and expand the military’s role in national affairs.Dar rejected concerns that the amendment might be passed without proper procedure. “It is not the case that the amendment is tabled and there is voting on it in a haphazard, ad hoc manner; this will not happen,” he said.He said the amendment would first be introduced in the Senate and then referred to a bipartisan committee for discussion, adding that the government would welcome positive suggestions to improve the draft.PPP Senator Raza Rabbani said the changes would damage provincial autonomy and “undo the good work of the 18th amendment,” which devolved powers to the provinces in 2010.The government has the required two-thirds majority in the 336-member National Assembly with the support of 233 members. In the 96-member Senate, it holds 61 seats and will need at least three opposition members to pass the amendment.The secrecy around the proposed changes, particularly the plan to amend Article 243, has drawn attention to whether the new constitutional move will give the armed forces greater influence in the country’s governance.","Pakistani government announces plans to introduce the 27th Constitutional Amendment.

Pakistan Among Countries Testing Nuclear Weapons, Donald Trump Says While Announcing US Testing Plan





US President Donald Trump has claimed that Pakistan is among several countries actively testing nuclear weapons, asserting that this justifies his administration’s decision to resume America’s own nuclear testing after more than 30 years.In an interview with CBS News’ 60 Minutes on Sunday, Trump said that Russia, China, North Korea and Pakistan were all conducting tests while the United States had refrained from doing so.“Russia’s testing and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. We’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it because otherwise you people are going to report. They don’t have reporters that are going to be writing about it,” he said.“We’re going to test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing,” Trump added.When questioned about his decision to resume nuclear detonations, Trump argued that such testing was necessary to ensure the reliability of US weapons systems, citing recent trials of advanced nuclear-capable systems by Russia.“You have to see how they work... We’re the only country that doesn’t test.And I don’t want to be the only country that doesn’t test,” he said.Confusion surrounded Trump’s announcement, first made on social media minutes before his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. The last US nuclear explosion occurred in 1992.While no country other than North Korea is known to have conducted a detonation for decades, Trump maintained that “they test way underground where people don’t know exactly what’s happening.”US energy secretary Chris Wright later clarified that current discussions referred to “non-critical” system tests, not full nuclear explosions.",US President Donald Trump has claimed that Pakistan is among several countries actively testing nuclear weapons.

Pakistan Issues Naval Warning as Its War Games Overlap with India’s Military Drills





Pakistan, heavily dependent on the waters of the Indus basin, faces a acute risk of insufficient water storage after India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year, according to the Ecological Threat Report 2025.The report, released by the Institute for Economics and Peace, a Sydney-based independent and non-profit think tank, says the suspension gives India the ability to control the westward flow of the Indus and its tributaries into Pakistan. The move came after India decided to put the treaty in abeyance as a punitive measure following the Pakistan-sponsored Pahalgam terror attack on April 22 this year.This marks a major setback for Pakistan, whose agriculture depends 80 per cent on the Indus River system. The report highlighted that Pakistan’s dams can currently hold only about 30 days of Indus flow, leaving the country highly vulnerable to disruptions.“Pakistan lacks sufficient storage to buffer variations,” the report warned, adding, “If India were truly to cut off or significantly reduce Indus flows, Pakistan’s densely populated plains would face severe water shortages, especially in winter and dry seasons.Indeed, about 80 per cent of Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture depends on Indus basin rivers.”While India’s infrastructure limits its ability to completely stop river flows, even small disruptions could have ""disastrous"" short-term effects on Pakistan’s farm sector.In May, India carried out “reservoir flushing” operations at the Salal and Baglihar dams on the Chenab River without notifying Pakistan. This process, used to remove silt by draining reservoirs, had been restricted under the treaty due to the risk of sudden downstream changes.The impact was immediate: parts of the Chenab River in Pakistan’s Punjab ran dry for several days when India shut the dam gates and later released sediment-filled torrents upon reopening them.The Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960 and mediated by the World Bank, has long acted as a key tool for water-sharing and conflict resolution between the two countries. It governs the use of the Indus River and its six major tributaries -- five on the left bank and one on the right.","India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year.

‘Pak Is Infuriated With…’: MEA Slams Pakistan Over Border Tensions With Afghanistan





Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) second-in-command Amjad, a key figure in the banned militant group, was killed along with three other militants when security forces foiled an infiltration attempt from Afghanistan into Pakistan, the army said on Thursday.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), cited by PTI, the militants tried to cross the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Bajaur district on Wednesday night when their movement was detected.“The troops effectively engaged and thwarted the militants' attempt to infiltrate,” the statement said, adding that four militants, including high-value target Amjad alias Mazahim, were “sent to hell.”Amjad, who served as deputy to TTP chief Noor Wali and headed the group’s Rehbari Shura, was among Pakistan’s most wanted militants, carrying a bounty of Rs five million. The ISPR said he was “actively involved in perpetuating numerous terrorist activities inside Pakistan while residing in Afghanistan.”The army also urged the interim Afghan government to take “concrete measures to ensure that Afghan soil is not used by militants to perpetrate terrorism against Pakistan.”Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded the security forces for eliminating the TTP commander and his aides. Prime Minister Shehbaz said the security forces, through their professional expertise, eliminated the highly wanted TTP commander Amjad and thwarted “the nefarious designs of the enemies of Pakistan's sovereignty.” He added, “We will continue to defeat the elements that harm innocent people. ”The operation in Bajaur came a day after six Pakistani soldiers, including a captain, were martyred during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district, where seven terrorists were also gunned down.Formed in 2007 as an umbrella organisation of several militant outfits, the TTP seeks to impose its strict version of Islam across Pakistan. The group, believed to have close ties with al-Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for numerous deadly attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad and the 2009 assault on army headquarters.","Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) second-in-command Amjad, a key figure in the banned militant group, was killed along with three other militants.

'Pakistan’s patience has run its course'



Growing tensions on the border







Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with the United States that allows the use of drones within its territory, TOLOnews reported, citing Afghan and diplomatic sources. The acknowledgment, made during the latest round of Pakistan-Afghanistan peace talks in Turkey.According to TOLOnews, the Pakistani delegation said it “cannot break” the agreement with Washington that authorises drone operations. Afghan negotiators, in response, demanded written guarantees that Pakistan would not allow US drones to use its airspace or strike Afghan territory. Sources familiar with the talks, cited by TOLOnews said Pakistan’s delegation initially agreed to these conditions but later reversed its position after receiving instructions from Islamabad, saying it had “no control over US drones and could not ensure action against ISIS. ” Qatari and Turkish mediators were reportedly taken aback by the sudden shift in stance.The Afghan side reiterated that the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) issue was Pakistan’s own internal problem. “The Islamic Emirate has repeatedly emphasised, and again reaffirmed, that insecurity in Pakistan is a domestic matter,” TOLOnews quoted its delegation as saying, adding that Afghanistan remains committed to ensuring no group uses its soil to harm other nations.The disclosure came as four days of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement. Pakistan’s information minister Attaullah Tarar said the dialogue “failed to bring about any workable solution,” blaming Kabul for refusing to act against militants responsible for cross-border attacks. “Pakistan’s patience has run its course,” Tarar said, adding that Islamabad “would continue to take all possible measures necessary to protect our people from terrorism. ”Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif issued a strong warning to the Taliban regime, vowing that Islamabad could “strike deep into Afghanistan” if further attacks occurred. “If their territory is used and they violate ours, we will retaliate — we surely will,” Asif told reporters. In a separate post on X, he cautioned Kabul against testing Pakistan’s “resolve and capabilities at its own peril and doom.”The breakdown in talks follows weeks of escalating border clashes that left dozens dead. Pakistan’s military earlier this month struck what it described as TTP hideouts inside Afghanistan, prompting retaliatory attacks that killed Pakistani soldiers. Though a ceasefire brokered by Qatar on 19 October remains technically in effect, all major crossings between the two countries remain closed, with hundreds of trucks stranded.Islamabad insists that the Afghan Taliban continues to shelter militants who launch attacks in Pakistan, a charge Kabul denies. The UN has expressed concern over the failed negotiations, urging both sides to avoid renewed fighting.","Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with the United States that allows the use of drones within its territory, TOLOnews reported.

Escalation Fears Mount As Pakistan-Afghanistan Talks End Without Conclusion In Turkey

Operation Sindoor







Days after Jaish-e-Mohammed announced the formation of its first-ever women's wing, 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat', the JeM's chief Masood Azhar has released a 21-minute audio message from group's Bahawalpur headquarters, Markaz Usman o Ali, outlining a detailed plan for training, indoctrinating, and deploying women under the new unit, as local media reported.According to media reports, in the audio, Azhar explains how women will be recruited, trained, and integrated into his long-term ""global jihad"" mission, mirroring the structure of JeM's long-running male training programme.Azhar declares that just as men undergo the 15-day ""Daura-e-Tarbiat"" course, women joining 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat' will be trained through an induction course named ""Daura-e-Taskiya"", conducted at Markaz Usman o Ali in Bahawalpur.For the past two decades, JeM's ""Daura-e-Tarbiat"" has served as the primary indoctrination stage for male recruits, convincing them that jihad against India guarantees paradise. Azhar now intends to extend the same ideological training to women.In his speech, the wanted terrorist promises that any woman who joins Jamaat-ul-Mominaat “will go straight to paradise from her grave after death.”He added that women completing the first course will advance to a second stage, ""Daura-Ayat-ul-Nisah,"" which will teach how Islamic texts ""instruct women to conduct jihad.""Justifying the formation of a female brigade, most-wanted terrorist Azhar claimed, ""The enemies of Jaish have put Hindu women into the army and set up female journalists against us,"" declaring that he is ""mobilising his women to compete and fight against them.""He asserts that JeM’s male Mujahids will work alongside this new female unit, saying the women’s brigade will ""spread Islam across the world.""Azhar also announces that Jamaat-ul-Mominaat branches will be opened in every district of Pakistan , each headed by a District Muntazima responsible for recruiting local women. He lays down strict communication rules, stating, ""Women joining the brigade must not speak to any unrelated men through phone or messenger, except their husbands or immediate family members.""According to IANS, the women’s wing will be led by Sadiya Azhar, sister of Masood Azhar. Her husband, Yusuf Azhar, was killed during Operation Sindoor on May 7, when Indian forces targeted JeM’s previous base, Markaz Subhanallah.""His other sister Samaira Azhar, and Afeera Farooq, widow of Pulwama attacker Umar Farooq, are also part of the leadership,"" sources confirmed, adding that “they are tasked with conducting daily online sessions to motivate and recruit women.”JeM has since verified these details in a new poster naming Umme Masood (real name Samaira Azhar) as the instructor for online classes, conducted five days a week from October 25.Azhar further reveals that Jamaat-ul-Mominaat includes “4–5 women whose male relatives were killed in encounters with the Indian Army,” who will inspire new recruits under a campaign called “Shoba-e-Dawat.”He urges women cadres to read his book “Ae Musalman Behna” (O Muslim Sister) as part of their indoctrination.It is significant that 14 members of Masood Azhar’s family were killed in India’s Operation Sindoor, including Yousuf Azhar, Jameel Ahmed, Hamza Jameel, and Huzaifa Azhar. Azhar now claims that his elder sister Hawa Bibi also died in the same strike.In the audio, an emotional Azhar recounts that he had conceptualised the idea of a women’s brigade with his sister before her death.In retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians, India launched a major military operation targeting Pakistan-based terror infrastructure. The counterterror action, named Operation Sindoor, struck nine key terror hubs across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The strikes destroyed major bases of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), including their headquarters in Bahawalpur and Muridke, which were reduced to rubble by precision airstrikes carried out by the Indian armed forces.In response, Pakistan attempted retaliation by launching multiple drones and missiles towards Indian territory the following night. However, India’s advanced air defence systems swiftly intercepted and neutralised the incoming threats, preventing any casualties or damage.India then answered this provocation with targeted strikes on crucial Pakistani airbases, including the strategically significant Nur Khan Airbase and Rahim Yar Khan Airbase.The heightened military tensions between the two neighbours were eventually de-escalated following a mutual peace agreement, initiated by Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO).Since then, these outfits have reportedly relocated to Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) region to avoid further strikes. Their leaders have been issuing propaganda messages and appeals for funds to rebuild their networks.Media sources also reveal that Masood Azhar has been aggressively collecting donations. During his September 27 address at Markaz Usman o Ali, he publicly appealed for financial support.JeM is now collecting a donation of 500 PKR from every woman enrolling in the new course and requiring them to fill out online registration forms.Earlier, on October 8, Masood Azhar formally announced the formation of Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, followed by an event titled “Dukhtaran-e-Islam” in Rawalakot, PoK, on October 19, aimed at drawing women into the organisation.While groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, Hamas, and LTTE have long deployed women in combat and suicide missions, organisations such as JeM, LeT, and Hizbul Mujahideen had largely avoided such practices -- until now. Security agencies believe JeM’s latest move signals its intent to train and deploy female suicide bombers in future terror operations.","Jaish-e-Mohammed announces formation of women's wing, 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat' JeM's chief Masood Azhar releases 21-minute audio message from group's Bahawalpur headquarters, Markaz Usman o Ali.

Pakistan has issued a stark warning to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan after the peace talks in Turkey failed to bear any outcome on Tuesday. Boasting Pakistan's defence arsenal, its Pakwarned that ""not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. ""“Let me assure them that Pakistan does not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. If they wish so, the repeat of the scenes of their rout at Tora Bora, with their tails between the legs, would surely be a spectacle to watch for the people of the region,” Dawn reported Asif saying.Kabul has blamed Pakistan for the failed peace talks in Turkey after Islamabad disagreed ""to stop violating Afghan airspace and prevent US drone flights,"" Tolo News reported citing sources.The violence, which left more than 70 people dead and wounded hundreds more, erupted after a series of explosions in Kabul on October 9, attacks that Taliban authorities have attributed to Pakistan. The two sides had been engaged in peace talks in Istanbul at the time.Pakistan information minister Attaullah Tarar on Wednesday informed in a post on X that the talks between the two nations had no conclusion as the ""Afghan side gave no assurances, kept deviating from the core issue.""""Regrettably, the Afghan side gave no assurances, kept deviating from the core issue and resorted to blame game, deflection and ruses,"" AFP quoted Tarar saying. ""The dialogue thus failed to bring about any workable solution.""Adding to this, Asif took a more firm stance warning Afghanistan against any ""terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan"".“We have borne your treachery and mockery for too long, but no more. Any terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan shall give you the bitter taste of such misadventures. Be rest assured and test our resolve and capabilities, if you wish so, at your own peril and doom,” Dawn quoted Asif saying.Though there has been no direct statements from Kabul's side, media reports stated that the talks broke down as ""Pakistani delegation reportedly presented demands that were also unacceptable to both sides.""According to Tolo News, sources said Islamabad pressed the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan to formally classify the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as a terrorist organization and to act against the group.Reacting to this, Afghanistan defence minister Mawlawi Mohammad Yaqoob Mujahid, said, “Pakistan and other countries use the label of terrorism for political purposes against their opponents.”However, a Pakistani security source said the Afghan delegation initially agreed to act decisively against the TTP but repeatedly backtracked under instructions from Kabul, AFP reported.Following the October 9 Kabul explosions, the Taliban launched a border offensive—prompting Pakistani strikes in response. A 48-hour ceasefire collapsed before a new truce was reached on October 19 in Doha, with Qatar and Turkey mediating. The border has now been shut for over two weeks, allowing only expelled Afghans to cross, leaving goods stranded and spoiling in places like Spin Boldak.","Kabul has blamed Pakistan for the failed peace talks in Turkey after Islamabad disagreed ""to stop violating Afghan airspace and prevent US drone flights,"" Tolo News reported citing sources.

Pakistan repeats old claims





Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday warned Afghanistan that if the attack on Islamabad continues, then they will give a 50 times stronger response, and accused Kabul of acting as a puppet for India.The remarks came after peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul dramatically collapsed.Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, Asif Kabul, using Pakistan’s familiar playbook of deflection, claimed that Kabul was merely a puppet in India’s hands.He said “I would compliment their delegation, but the people in Kabul pulling the strings and staging the puppet show are being controlled by Delhi.""""India is compensating for its defeat on their western border through Kabul. The junta there (in Afghanistan) has elements that have visited India and visited their temples,"" Asif claimed. ""India wants to engage in a low-intensity war with Pakistan. To achieve this, they are using Kabul,"" he added.When asked to comment on threats by Afghanistan that they would “attack Islamabad” in the event of further hostilities, Asif replied: “If Afghanistan even looks at Islamabad, we will gouge their eyes out.“They can employ the use of terrorists and they already are. Over the past four years, they have been using terrorists,” he added.“There should be no doubt that Kabul is responsible for the terrorism in Pakistan. Kabul is a tool for Delhi. If they want to, God forbid, attack Islamabad, we will give a befitting response. A response 50 times stronger,” the defence minister said.Kabul had previously rejected Islamabad’s accusations as unfounded.Still, the Pakistani minister praised the Afghan negotiators for their cooperation — even as he directed sharp criticism at the Kabul leadership.This is not the first time. Earlier also, Pakistan claimed India was behind a recent assault in Afghanistan. Ministry of external affairs dismissed Pakistan’s accusations that India was behind a recent assault in Afghanistan, saying Islamabad’s record of harbouring terrorism was well knownAt the weekly press briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “Three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbours for its own internal failures. Three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories.""The remarks followed the collapse of the latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Turkey. According to Afghan and Pakistani sources cited by Reuters, both sides had earlier agreed to a ceasefire on October 19 in Doha but failed to make progress in Istanbul.Each country blamed the other for the stalemate. The discussions, mediated by Turkey and Qatar, concluded on Monday without any breakthrough.","Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif warned Afghanistan that if the attack on Islamabad continues, then they will give a 50 times stronger response.

The quake claimed the lives of at least 20 and injured more than 300, with authorities warning that the toll could rise.According to the US Geological Survey, the quake occurred at a depth of 28 kilometers (17.4 miles) near the city, which is home to about 523,000 people.Videos circulating on social media showed the widespread destruction caused by the quake, with footage capturing residents rushing out of their homes as buildings shook and partially collapsed.The earthquake also damaged parts of the holy shrine in Mazar-i-Sharif, according to Balkh province spokesperson Haji Zaid, as reported by Reuters.The US Geological Survey (USGS) issued an orange alert through its PAGER system, which provides automated assessments of earthquake impacts.It warned that “significant casualties are likely and the disaster is potentially widespread.” The alert noted that past earthquakes of similar intensity have typically required regional or national-level responses.Eastern and northeastern Afghanistan, particularly areas bordering Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Pakistan, are highly prone to earthquakes.Afghanistan lies on the edge of the Eurasian tectonic plate, where it meets the Indian plate and is also affected by the Arabian plate to the south.This makes it one of the world’s most earthquake-prone regions. Most quakes occur due to the Indian plate pushing northward against the Eurasian plate.Heavily populated Kabul suffers the highest average earthquake damage in Afghanistan, estimated at about $17 million annually, according to a study cited by Reuters.Quakes are especially dangerous in the country’s mountainous regions, where they often trigger landslides that worsen destruction and casualties.Since 1900, Afghanistan has recorded nearly 100 “damaging” earthquakes. One of the strongest, a 7.5-magnitude quake in 2015, killed 399 people across Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India.In August, another powerful earthquake and a series of strong aftershocks struck southeastern Afghanistan, killing more than 2,200 people and injuring thousands.","A powerful 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck northern Afghanistan early Monday near the city of Mazar-e-Sharif.

At least 20 people were killed and 250 injured after an earthquake of magnitude 6.3 struck Afghanistan on Sunday.According to the United States Geological Survey, the earthquake hit at a depth of 28 km (17.4 miles) near Mazar-e Sharif, which has a population of about 523,000.Sharafat Zaman, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Health, earlier said at least 10 people died and 260 were injured in the earthquake. Later, the ministry confirmed that death toll has risen to 20.Meanwhile, the earthquake also destroyed part of the holy shrine of Mazar-i-Sharif, Balkh province spokesperson Haji Zaid told Reuters.The USGS issued an orange alert in its PAGER system, which is an automated system that produces information on the impact of earthquakes, and indicated that ""significant casualties are likely and the disaster is potentially widespread"".Past events with this alert level have required a regional or national level response, the system's alert added.Earlier in August, thousands died and thousands more were injured after earthquake and a series of aftershocks hit AfghanistanAfghanistan is especially vulnerable to earthquakes as the country is located on two major active faults that have the potential to rupture and cause extensive damage.Large tremors in western Herat, near the Iranian border, in 2023, and in eastern Nangarhar province in 2022 killed hundreds and destroyed thousands of homes.The United Nations and aid agencies have warned hunger is rising in the Afghan population and the isolated country is suffering from a humanitarian crisis compounded by drought, economic restrictions on the banking sector, and the pushback of millions of Afghan citizens from neighbouring Iran and Pakistan.Earthquakes are common in Afghanistan, particularly along the Hindu Kush mountain range, near where the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates meet.","The earthquake hit at a depth of 28 km (17.4 miles) near Mazar-e Sharif, which has a population of about 523,000.

Born after 2007? You’ll never be allowed to smoke in the Maldives — here’s what the new rules say,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/born-after-2007-youll-never-be-allowed-to-smoke-in-the-maldives-heres-what-the-new-rules-say/articleshow/125031180.cms,"(AI image generated using ChatGPT)





The Maldives began Saturday a generational smoking ban on anyone born after January 2007, becoming the only nation with such a prohibition, the Health Ministry said.The move, initiated by President Mohamed Muizzu earlier this year, came into effect on November 1 and will “protect public health and promote a tobacco-free generation”, the ministry said, as per AP.“Under the new provision, individuals born on or after January 1-2007 are prohibited from purchasing, using, or being sold tobacco products within the Maldives,” it added.“The ban applies to all forms of tobacco, and retailers are required to verify age prior to sale.” It also applies to visitors to the nation of 1,191 tiny coral islets scattered some 800 kilometres (500 miles) across the equator and known for its luxury tourism.The ministry said it also maintains a comprehensive ban on the import, sale, distribution, possession, and use of electronic cigarettes and vaping products, applicable to all individuals regardless of age.Selling tobacco products to an underage person carries a penalty of 50,000 rufiyaa ($3,200), while using vape devices carries a fine of 5,000 rufiyaa ($320).A similar generational ban proposed in Britain is still going through the legislative process, while New Zealand — the first country to enact such a law against smoking — repealed it in November 2023, less than a year after it was introduced.","The Maldives began Saturday a generational smoking ban on anyone born after January 2007.

‘ Violent insurrection ’

'Principal architect': Interim govt targets Hasina





Ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said she fled the country on August 5 last year “out of necessity"". She claimed that remaining in Bangladesh, which was battling widespread protests against Hasina, would have endangered her life and the ""safety of those around her"".“Staying would not only have put my life in danger, but also the lives of those around me,"" she said, speaking in an exclusive interview with The Independent.Despite fleeing the country and the Awami League being banned in Bangladesh, she maintains that she is still committed to “restoring democracy” in the country.Hasina described the August protests in Bangladesh as a “violent insurrection.”“As a leader, I ultimately take leadership responsibility, but the claim that I ordered or wished for the security forces to open fire on the crowds is simply wrong,"" she said.She added that she blames the high number of casualties on “breakdowns in discipline among security forces on the ground.” Hasina said her government had launched an independent inquiry into the initial killings, which was later shut down by the interim administration that replaced her.She said that she would “neither be surprised nor intimidated” if Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) sentenced her to death, calling the proceedings “a sham trial” motivated by political revenge.“The ICT is a sham court presided over by an unelected government consisting of my political opponents. Many of those opponents will stop at nothing to get rid of me,"" Hasina said, as cited by The Independent.What began last July as a movement by university students demanding the removal of job quotas for relatives of independence war veterans soon grew into a nationwide uprising in Bangladesh, which ultimately led to Hasina fleeing the country.Hasina disputed the widely reported death toll from the student-led protests, saying that “the 1,400 figure is useful to the ICT for propaganda purposes but is probably inflated.”Meanwhile, the interim government's chief prosecutor, Tajul Islam, has called Hasina the “mastermind and principal architect” behind the alleged crimes against humanity during the student-led uprising.","Ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said she fled the country on August 5 last year “out of necessity” She claimed that remaining in Bangladesh, which was battling widespread protests against Hasina, would have endangered her life and the ""safety of those around her"" Hasina described the August protests in Bangladesh as a “violent insurrection”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124988908,imgsize-637906,width-400,resizemode-4/sheikh-hasina-ani.jpg"
‘If patience is tested again ...’: Afghanistan's stern warning to Pakistan after ceasefire; how talks unfolded,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/if-patience-is-tested-again-afghanistans-stern-warning-to-pakistan-after-ceasefire-how-talks-unfolded/articleshow/124980466.cms,"Escalation Fears Mount As Pakistan-Afghanistan Talks End Without Conclusion In Turkey





Afghanistan’s interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani has issued a stern warning to Pakistan, saying Kabul’s patience should not be mistaken for weakness as both sides agreed to maintain a fragile ceasefire after days of failed negotiations.Haqqani warned that if Afghanistan’s patience was tested again, the country would deliver a “crushing” response. “Defending our territory is among our priorities,” he said. “Yet despite all this, the path of understanding remains open. But if someone commits aggression, we have fought the emperors of the world and it is no difficulty for us to defend our territory,” the interior minister said as quoted by TOLOnews.Haqqani added that Afghanistan may lack long-range missiles or heavy weapons but has “strong resolve and determination in the battle against aggression.” Without naming Pakistan, he accused some nations of violating the sovereignty of others “to preserve their interests.” “Afghans have proved themselves in the battlefield,” he warned. “If our patience is tested again, our response will be very crushing,” he said, as per TOLOnews.His comments came soon after Turkey announced that Pakistan and Afghanistan had agreed to uphold a ceasefire following days of tense talks in Istanbul, mediated by Turkey and Qatar. The ceasefire deal, confirmed on Thursday, aims to prevent further border clashes that have recently left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. The two sides are set to reconvene in Istanbul on November 6 to finalise a monitoring and verification mechanism, including penalties for any violation of the agreement.Despite the progress, the border remains shut, with hundreds of trucks and refugees stranded on both sides. Afghan government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said Kabul was committed to “resolving disputes through diplomacy” and wanted “relations based on mutual respect, non-interference, and not posing a threat to any side.”In Islamabad, defence minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif said Pakistan agreed to continue talks at the request of Qatar and Turkey. Pakistani officials reiterated that their main demand was for Afghanistan to take “clear, verifiable and effective action” against militant groups operating on its soil.Tensions spiked earlier this month when Kabul accused Pakistan of launching airstrikes inside Afghanistan, including one that hit a market in the east. Afghan officials claimed they retaliated, killing 58 Pakistani soldiers, though Islamabad said 23 of its troops died while targeting militant hideouts.",Afghanistan’s interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani has issued a stern warning to Pakistan.

'I'd love to go home but...': Sheikh Hasina on life in New Delhi; warns of voter boycott as her party barred from Bangladesh polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/id-love-to-go-home-but-sheikh-hasina-on-life-in-new-delhi-warns-of-voter-boycott-as-her-party-barred-from-bangladesh-polls/articleshow/124910852.cms,"Bangladesh Political Crisis: Sheikh Hasina's Son Sajeeb Wazed Urges Yunus For Inclusive Election





NEW DELHI: Ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday said she lives freely in New Delhi, and “would love to go home” but remains cautious, given her family’s violent past.“I would of course love to go home, so long as the government there was legitimate, the constitution was being upheld, and law and order genuinely prevailed,” Hasina told Reuters in her first media engagement after her dramatic fall from power last year.The 78-year-old Awami League chief fled to India in August 2024 after a deadly student-led uprising ended her 15-year rule. An interim government led by Muhammad Yunus has ruled Bangladesh since Hasina’s ouster and has promised to hold elections in February 2026.Sitting in the Indian capital, Hasina said she won’t return to Bangladesh under any government formed through elections that exclude her party.Hasina further warned that millions of Awami League supporters would boycott next year’s national election, after the party was barred from contesting the polls.“The ban on the Awami League is not only unjust, it is self-defeating,” she said in emailed responses to Reuters.“The next government must have electoral legitimacy. Millions of people support the Awami League, so as things stand, they will not vote. You cannot disenfranchise millions of people if you want a political system that works,” she added.Once praised for transforming Bangladesh’s economy, Hasina now faces charges of crimes against humanity over a brutal crackdown on student protests in mid-2024.A verdict from the International Crimes Tribunal is expected on November 13, Reuters reported.A United Nations report estimates that up to 1,400 people were killed and thousands more injured, mostly by security forces’ gunfire, during the unrest between July 15 and August 5, marking Bangladesh’s deadliest violence since the 1971 war of independence.“These proceedings are a politically motivated charade,” Hasina said, denying the allegations. “They’ve been brought by kangaroo courts, with guilty verdicts a foregone conclusion. I was mostly denied prior notice or any meaningful opportunity to defend myself,” she added.Despite her exile, Hasina remains hopeful about her party’s future.“It’s really not about me or my family,” she said. “For Bangladesh to achieve the future we all want, there must be a return to constitutional rule and political stability. No single person or family defines our country’s future.”",Ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina says she lives freely in New Delhi.

In a rare confession, Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with a ""foreign country"" which allowed it to carry drone strikes on Afghanistan soil, Tolo News reported citing source. It has sought retreat from the Turkey talks asking the Afghan side to ""accept that Pakistan has the right to carry out attacks on Afghan soil during TTP assaults. ""The report, however, did not reveal the ""foreign country"" under question.It further said that because of the agreement, Pakistan ""cannot prevent such strikes because breaking the agreement is not possible.""According to the report, the source claimed there was a lack of coordination within the Pakistani delegation, suggesting that rather than putting forward a coherent case, they seemed more inclined to backtrack and walk away from the talks.The Islamic Emirate’s delegation has argued that the TTP matter is Pakistan’s own longstanding internal issue, not something that concerns Afghanistan.This came after reports suggested that there was a deadlock in the Pakistan-Afghanistan truce talks with both the nations blaming each other for failure to reach a deal.There has been no official comment about the status of the talks.","Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with a ""foreign country"" which allowed it to carry drone strikes on Afghanistan soil.

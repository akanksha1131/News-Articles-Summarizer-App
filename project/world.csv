‘I need help with you’: Donald Trump says he denied Vladimir Putin’s offer to help on Iran; redirects focus to Ukraine deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/i-need-help-with-you-donald-trump-says-he-denied-vladimir-putins-offer-to-help-on-iran-redirects-focus-to-ukraine-deal/articleshow/122059814.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin (Picture credit: AP)





US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had called him to offer assistance in dealing with the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel, but he redirected the conversation to focus on the war in Ukraine.“Vladimir called me up. He said, ‘Can I help you with Iran?’ I said, ‘No, I don’t need help with Iran. I need help with you'”, Trump told journalists en route to the Nato summit.Trump added that he hoped to strike a deal with Russia soon, remarking, “Six thousand soldiers died last week,” in reference to ongoing battlefield losses in Ukraine. He did not offer further details about what such a deal might include or the status of talks.The comments came as Trump was en route to the Nato summit in The Hague, where he is set to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines. The two leaders have had a tense relationship in the past, and summit organisers have deliberately shortened the main working session to avoid any high-profile confrontations, according to news agency AFP.As per The Kyiv Independent, Russia has launched a new summer offensive in Ukraine, disregarding Kyiv’s calls for an unconditional ceasefire.Trump’s push for a peace deal comes as he continues to question the level of US financial support to Ukraine and remains sceptical of Kyiv’s war aims, reportedly believing Ukraine’s expectations are “unrealistic” given the current situation on the ground.Meanwhile, Nato allies are preparing to adopt a new defence spending pledge of 5 per cent of GDP, 3.5 per cent for core military needs and 1.5 per cent for broader security, to ensure continued US support.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the plan as “historic,” and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte praised Trump for “bringing everyone on board,” AFP reported.Still, Trump has stirred unease among Nato partners. During his flight to The Hague, he refused to explicitly affirm his commitment to Nato’s Article 5 mutual defence clause, saying, “Depends on your definition. There’s numerous definitions of Article Five,” a remark likely to alarm allies already wary of his unpredictable stance.He also lashed out at Spain for initially resisting the new defence spending plan, posting, “Spain threatens to derail Nato summit,” and complaining about its “very unfair” position. Spain eventually agreed after a €10 billion increase to meet Nato’s existing 2 per cent target.Trump’s overture to Putin also comes as Russia continues to deepen its military and nuclear cooperation with Iran. Moscow has relied heavily on Iranian Shahed drones in its campaign against Ukraine, while the two nations have cooperated in advancing nuclear capabilities under Western sanctions.Zelenskyy, speaking in The Hague ahead of his meeting with Trump, reaffirmed Ukraine’s position and said, “Russia must see that Ukraine will not be left alone and that Europe will not back down.”However, under pressure from the US, Nato is not expected to mention Ukraine’s membership aspirations in the summit’s final communiqué.","US President Donald Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin called him to offer assistance in dealing with the conflict between Iran and Israel.

A cargo ship transporting nearly 3,000 vehicles to Mexico sank in the North Pacific Ocean on Monday, weeks after a fire forced its crew to abandon the vessel.The ship, named Morning Midas, went down in international waters off Alaska’s Aleutian Islands, according to a statement from the vessel’s management company, London-based Zodiac Maritime.The fire broke out on June 3, when the Morning Midas was about 300 miles southwest of Adak Island. The blaze burned out of control for days, ultimately disabling the 600-foot ship, which was built in 2006 and sailed under a Liberian flag, reported the Seattle Times.All 22 crew members evacuated safely to a lifeboat and were rescued by a nearby merchant marine ship. No injuries were reported during the evacuation.Despite efforts to contain the damage, worsening weather and water seepage contributed to the ship's sinking in waters approximately 16,400 feet deep and about 415 miles from land.The ship had departed from Yantai, China, on May 26 and was headed to a major Pacific port in Mexico. It was carrying around 3,000 new vehicles, including about 70 electric and 680 hybrid models. A plume of smoke had been observed coming from the ship’s stern, reportedly from the area where electric vehicles were stored.While it remains unclear whether any of the vehicles were salvaged before the sinking, Zodiac Maritime confirmed that two salvage tugs equipped with pollution control gear remain on-site to monitor for environmental risks.The company is also dispatching a specialized pollution response vessel as a precaution.According to the US Coast Guard, no visible pollution has been detected so far. Right now we also have vessels on scene to respond to any pollution,” said Petty Officer Cameron Snell, based in Alaska.The incident follows growing global concerns about fire safety on ships carrying electric vehicles. A recent Dutch safety board report called for improved emergency response on North Sea routes after a similar fire in 2023 on a freighter transporting cars from Germany to Singapore.","The ship, named Morning Midas, went down in international waters off Alaska’s Aleutian Islands.

The United States deployed its B-2 Spirit bombers in Sunday's strikes on three key nuclear facilities in Iran. The aircraft, sometimes also referred to as the “Stealth” bomber, has an Indian connection - a naturalized US citizen from India was involved in the development of the plane's propulsion system.The engineer, Mumbai-born Noshir Gowadia, was later sentenced to over 30 years in prison for sharing classified military information with China, with which Beijing developed a cruise missile exhaust system to make Chinese cruise missiles resistant to detection.According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Gowadia, now 81, was first arrested in October 2005 on a criminal complaint which alleged that he ""wilfully communicated"" national defense-related information to a person ""not entitled to receive it.""As per information produced during the trial, Gowadia worked with Northrop Grumman Corporation - the makers of B2 bombers - for almost 20 years, from approximately 1968 to 1986. During this time, he contributed to the development of the unique propulsion system and low observable capabilities of the B-2; he also continued to work on classified matters as a contractor with the with the United States government until 1997, when his security clearance was revoked.Evidence displayed at the trial showed that Gowadia visited China six times between June 2003 and July 2005 to provide defense services in the form of design, test support and test data analysis of technologies for the purpose of helping Beijing build a cruise missile system by developing a stealthy exhaust nozzle.At the time of his arrest, Gowadia had been paid at least $110,000 by the Chinese.Gowadia was found guilty in August 2010, following six days of deliberation after a trial spanning nearly four months in Honolulu. In January 2011, he was handed a jail term of 32 years.(This is a top Google Trends topic)","Noshir Gowadia, a naturalized US citizen from India, was involved in the development of the B-2 bomber's propulsion system.

Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah, urged Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to step down now if he wants to get a fair trial, something that Reza said Khamenei never gave to any Iranian. Reza Pahlavi announced that he was ready to take the regime over and he was setting up a new secure platform for dissidents and internal opponents of the regime to coordinate their efforts to overthrow the disctatorrshio and put the country on the path of a ""free and democratic"" future.“We are a proud, ancient and resilient people,” Pahlavi told a press conference in Paris on Monday. “To my compatriots: This is our moment. I am with you. Let us build this new Iran together.”“I am here today to submit myself to my compatriots to lead them down this road of peace.”Pahlavi said he has spoken with people across Iran and realized that this is Iran's Berlin Wall moment. ""But like all moments of great change, it comes fraught with danger. We stand at a crossroads. One road leads to bloodshed and chaos. The other—to a peaceful and democratic transition,"" he said.The destruction of the Natanz, Isfahan and Fordow has diminished the regime's domestic nuclear enrichment, he said. ""But it does not diminish the regime’s intent to acquire and use nuclear weapons.

‘Naked political provocation’: China slams US over spy recruitment videos; mocks CIA’s drive as ‘absurd’ and ‘amateurish’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/naked-political-provocation-china-slams-us-over-spy-recruitment-videos-mocks-cias-drive-as-absurd-and-amateurish/articleshow/122060315.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.





Beijing has sharply criticised the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for what it called an ""absurd"" and ""clumsy"" attempt to recruit Chinese citizens through social media videos.In a statement posted Wednesday on its official WeChat account, China’s ministry of state security (MSS) called the CIA’s efforts an “amateurish gambit” and accused the US of “paranoid delusions.”“These two painstakingly crafted ‘job ads’, riddled with clumsy rhetoric and slanderous claims, lay bare the absurd logic and paranoid delusions of American intelligence agencies,” said the MSS, as cited by news agency AFP.“Once again, the self-proclaimed 'world’s top intelligence power' has turned itself into an international laughingstock through its baffling incompetence.”The CIA videos, posted last month on platforms including YouTube and X, featured fictional narratives of Chinese officials secretly contacting the CIA over concerns about corruption and lack of progress within the Communist Party.The clips also included contact information on the dark web and encouraged potential informants to take control of their own fates.“Heaven helps those who help themselves,” one of the CIA videos stated, showing a senior Chinese official expressing fear for his family’s future before reaching out to the CIA.CIA Director John Ratcliffe had confirmed to Fox News that the videos were aimed at “recruiting Chinese officials to help the US” by sharing classified information. “One of the ways we do that is by recruiting assets that can help us steal secrets,” he said.The MSS condemned the initiative as a “naked political provocation” and warned that “any attempt to incite betrayal among the Chinese people is doomed to fail, and any plot to infiltrate China for intelligence will prove futile,” according to AFP.The campaign sparked mockery on Chinese social media. On Weibo, users joked about the videos, with one commenter asking, “Can we organise a group of scammers to carry out a telecom fraud against the CIA?”The US and China have a long history of accusing each other of espionage. Earlier this year, China claimed to have implicated three US “secret agents” in cyberattacks during February’s Asian Winter Games.The MSS also said in March it sentenced a former Chinese engineer to death for allegedly leaking state secrets to a foreign country.The CIA’s latest effort to boost human intelligence follows its broader push to recruit sources in adversarial nations such as Iran and North Korea. The agency had previously launched a similar online campaign targeting Russia.","US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) launched social media campaign to recruit Chinese citizens.

India-born B-2 engineer's espionage revisited as US targets Iran with stealth bomber,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/india-born-b-2-engineers-espionage-revisited-as-us-targets-iran-with-stealth-bomber/articleshow/122060177.cms,"A brilliant Bombay-born engineer helped build America's deadliest ghost in the sky. Then he betrayed it. Sold its secrets to China.

The former Northrop engineer helped design B-2 stealth bomber's propulsion system, held top-level security clearance, and taught classified aeronautics. He was convicted of espionage after passing classified information to Beijing.Born April 11, 1944, to a Parsi family, Gowadia reportedly earned the equivalent of a PhD by 15. At 19, he left for US to study aeronautical engineering and became a naturalised American on July 25, 1969. A year later, he joined Northrop, where he was instrumental in developing the B-2 Spirit's infrared-shielded propulsion system.""The entire geometry came from me,"" Gowadia said. His internal codename: ""Blueberry Milkshake"". Northrop secured the B-2 contract in 1981, the bomber's defining breakthrough being its radar-elusive profile.Gowadia's work reduced visual, infrared, and radar signatures - vital to B-2's stealth edge.He left Northrop to start his own defence consultancy in Albuquerque. He advised on CIA aircraft and nuclear weapons at Los Alamos, and in 1999, launched NS Gowadia Inc. But mounting expenses drove him to look abroad for clients - a search that ended in China. Gowadia made three trips to China, providing details on stealth propulsion. Beijing used the information to build an undetectable exhaust system for cruise missiles. His payment: $110,000. Years later, satellites picked up what looked like a B-2 clone drone at a Chinese air base.On Oct 13, 2005, FBI agents knocked on Gowadia's Hawaii home. Seeing handcuffs, Gowadia muttered: ""No."" The agent tucked them away. On Oct 26, he was arrested and charged with one count of sharing national defence secrets with a foreign nation. On Oct 22, 2005, he wrote his final confession: ""On reflection what I did was wrong to help the PRC make a cruise missile. What I did was espionage and treason because I shared military secrets with the PRC. ""Gowadia was convicted on 14 counts under Espionage Act and Arms Export Control Act.

Trump administration authorizes $30 million for Israeli-backed group distributing food in Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-authorizes-30-million-for-israeli-backed-group-distributing-food-in-gaza/articleshow/122060051.cms,"Trump administration authorizes $30 million for Israeli-backed group distributing food in Gaza (Image: AP)





WASHINGTON: The Trump administration has authorized providing $30 million to a US- and Israeli-backed group that is distributing food in Gaza, a US official said Tuesday, an operation that has drawn criticism from other humanitarian organizations.The request is the first known US government funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's aid distribution efforts amid the Israel-Hamas war. The American-led group had applied for the money to the US Agency for International Development, which has been dismantled and will soon be absorbed into the State Department as part of the Trump administration's deep cuts of foreign aid.The application is part of a controversial development: private contracting firms led by former US intelligence officers and military veterans delivering aid to some of the world's deadliest conflict zones in operations organized with governments that are combatants in the conflicts.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive diplomatic issue involving a controversial aid program, said the decision to directly fund GHF was made ""to provide effective and accessible humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza.""The announcement comes as violence and chaos have plagued areas near the new food distribution sites since opening last month. In a statement, GHF refuted AP's reporting about any killings near its sites.The group says it has delivered some 44 million meals to Palestinians in need.Palestinian witnesses and health officials say Israeli forces have repeatedly opened fire on crowds heading toward desperately needed food, killing hundreds in recent weeks. The Israeli military says it has fired warning shots at people it said approached its forces in a suspicious manner.Witnesses said Israeli troops opened fire as crowds tried to reach a GHF site on Tuesday in southern Gaza. At least 19 were killed and 50 others wounded, according to Nasser hospital and Gaza's Health Ministry. The Israeli military did not immediately comment.Israel wants the GHF to replace a system coordinated by the United Nations and international aid groups. Along with the United States, it accuses Hamas of stealing aid, without offering evidence. The United Nations, its affiliated aid agencies and private humanitarian groups that work in Gaza have denied that there has been any significant theft of their supplies by Hamas.UN agencies, humanitarian groups and crisis experts have warned for months that many of Gaza's more than 2 million people are on the brink of famine. Israel recently eased a blockade on food and other humanitarian supplies to the territory, but the UN humanitarian aid office says deliveries into Gaza remain severely restricted, describing the current flow of food as a trickle into an area facing catastrophic levels of hunger.The Oxfam America aid organization condemned the Trump administration's funding decision Tuesday, calling the US and Israeli-supported aid operation ""a multimillion-dollar distraction from the actual causes - and solutions - of Gaza's humanitarian crisis that also carries fatal risks for its intended beneficiaries.""The Associated Press reported Saturday that the American-led group had asked the Trump administration for the initial funding so it can continue its aid operation, which has been criticized by the UN, humanitarian groups and others. They accuse the foundation of cooperating with Israel's objectives in the 21-month-old war against Hamas in a way that violates humanitarian principles.State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters earlier Tuesday that she had no information to provide on funding for the foundation.","The request is the first known US government funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's aid distribution efforts amid the Israel-Hamas war.

Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old Indian-origin Muslim and democratic socialist, has pulled off a stunning upset in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary, defeating former governor Andrew Cuomo. With 95% of ballots counted, Mamdani was leading with 43% of the vote, though a final result awaits the completion of ranked-choice tabulations.Cuomo, attempting a political comeback after resigning in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal, conceded shortly after polls closed. “Tonight is his night.

Cuomo too has left open the possibility of continuing as an independent.New York is a key Democratic stronghold, widely regarded as one of the party’s ""Big Three"" power bases, along with California and Illinois.Born in Uganda to Indian parents, Mamdani’s campaign resonated with younger voters, driven by promises of free buses, universal childcare, rent freezes, and taxing the wealthy.His grassroots strategy and social media savvy helped him gain endorsements from progressives like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Supporters celebrated outside polling stations across Central Brooklyn, dancing and handing out iced tea in the sweltering heat. “It’s 100 degrees outside and it’s a vibe,” said Amani Kojo, a 23-year-old first-time voter. “It feels very electric seeing all the people around, the flyers, all the posts on my Instagram all day.”While Cuomo and others labelled Mamdani inexperienced and unqualified, especially for his pro-Palestinian stance, Mamdani hit back sharply. “To Mr. Cuomo, I have never had to resign in disgrace,” he said during one debate.","Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old Indian-origin Muslim and democratic socialist, has pulled off a stunning upset in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary.

'Bomb Iran': Trump baits Tehran; posts parody video hours after declaring ceasefire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bomb-iran-trump-baits-tehran-posts-parody-video-hours-after-declaring-ceasefire/articleshow/122059726.cms,"Donald Trump and Ayatollah Khamenei (AP)

A fragile ceasefire





Just hours after announcing a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, US President Donald Trump posted a parody song titled “Bomb Iran”. The video, shared on Trump’s Truth Social account, featured footage of B-2 bombers set to the 1980 parody track by Vince Vance & the Valiants, which includes the lyric: “Ol’ Uncle Sam’s getting pretty hot, time to turn Iran into a parking lot. ”This came after, Iranian state TV released a bizarre Lego-style animation showing a cartoon Trump eating a cheeseburger while speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The animation ended with the message: “We control the game.”The post came after a fragile ceasefire took effect following nearly two weeks of intense conflict between Israel and Iran. Trump had earlier claimed that US strikes had “completely destroyed” Iran’s nuclear programme. “THE NUCLEAR SITES IN IRAN ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED!” he posted online, dismissing a classified US intelligence assessment that found the bombing campaign had only set back Tehran’s programme by a few months.The White House stood by Trump’s claims, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling the leaked report “flat-out wrong” and denouncing it as an effort to “discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission.”The conflict saw Israeli airstrikes targeting Iranian military and nuclear facilities, while Iran launched missile attacks in retaliation. At least 610 civilians were killed in Iran, according to its health ministry, while Israel reported 28 deaths. US forces joined the fray with bunker-buster bombs on key Iranian nuclear sites, which Trump declared had neutralised the threat.However, intelligence sources cited by CNN and the Associated Press said centrifuges remained functional and enriched uranium stockpiles had likely been relocated before the strikes. Despite the public statements by Trump and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth—who insisted the bombs “obliterated Iran’s ability to create nuclear weapons”—analysts believe much of Iran’s underground nuclear infrastructure survived.Trump appeared frustrated at the shaky start to the ceasefire. “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don’t know what the f—- they’re doing,” he said. Hours later, he claimed the truce had been salvaged, telling reporters that Israeli warplanes would “turn around and head home” and that “nobody will be hurt.”","US President Donald Trump posted a parody song titled ""Bomb Iran"" The video featured footage of B-2 bombers set to the 1980 parody track by Vince Vance & the Valiants.

Karmelo Anthony, the teen who admitted to stabbing and killing Austin Metcalf, at a track meet in Texas in self defense has been indicted by a grand jury with first-degree murder. The indictment came after the local district attorney presented evidence to a grand jury asking jurors to uphold a first-degree murder charge.""For weeks, my team has been presenting evidence to the grand jury. Today, I summarized that evidence, and I asked the Grand Jury to return a first degree murder indictment against Karmelo Anthony— which they did,"" Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis said in a press release Tuesday afternoon.""With that indictment, the case now moves formally into the court system. From this point forward, we’ll continue doing our part — fully and fairly — to pursue justice under the law. The trial schedule will be set by the court. But when the time comes, we’ll be ready.""The incident shocked the country as Anthony was released on bond because of his lack of criminal history, age and community ties. nthony was released on house arrest with an ankle monitor, required to remain under adult supervision, avoid contact with Metcalf’s family, and check in with the court weekly. His defense attorneys, Mike Howard, Billy Clark, and Kim Cole, argued the $1 million bond was excessive for a first-time offender, emphasizing the need for a fair investigationAccording to an arrest-warrant affidavit and witness statements, the incident unfolded during a weather delay caused by thunderstorms and heavy rain.Both students were under a tent designated for Memorial High School’s track team, where Metcalf was a member. Anthony, a student from Centennial High School, was reportedly sitting in the Memorial team’s tent, leading to a verbal dispute. A witness stated that Metcalf told Anthony to move, to which Anthony responded by reaching into his bag and saying, “Touch me and see what happens. ” When Metcalf touched or pushed Anthony, Anthony allegedly escalated the situation by saying, “Punch me and see what happens.” According to the affidavit, Metcalf grabbed Anthony to move him, at which point Anthony pulled out a black knife and stabbed Metcalf once in the chest before fleeing the scene.Metcalf, bleeding heavily, ran down the bleachers, grabbing his chest and calling for help. His twin brother, Hunter Metcalf, attempted to save him by applying pressure to the wound, but despite efforts from athletic trainers and emergency responders, Metcalf was pronounced dead at a hospital shortly after. Surveillance footage from Kuykendall Stadium, released under strict conditions by Frisco ISD, captured the moment of the altercation but is distant and does not clearly identify individuals or the act itself. The footage shows sudden movement under the tent around 9:55 a.m., followed by people dispersing and emergency response effortsAnthony surrendered to police at the scene and was taken into custody. He admitted to the stabbing, stating, “I’m not alleged, I did it,” and claimed self-defense, saying, “He put his hands on me, I told him not to.” While in the police vehicle, Anthony was described as “crying hysterically” and asked if Metcalf would be okay and whether his actions could be considered self-defense.","Karmelo Anthony, the teen who admitted to stabbing and killing Austin Metcalf, at a track meet in Texas in self defense has been indicted by a grand jury.

The core components of Ira's nuclear program are intact, and they can be set back by months, a top secret assessment of the US intelligence revealed, CNN reported.

On Fox News, the vice president said the location of the uranium is not the question before the US now but the question is whether Iran can make nuclear weapons from what they have.The Iranian stockpile of uranium was believed to have been located mainly at Isfahan, which houses a conversion facility that turns uranium into the form that can be fed into centrifuges for enrichment. “The goal was to bury the uranium, and I do think the uranium is buried,” Vance said.Vance dismissed the possibility that Iran moved the stockpile before the attack and said the Midnight Hammer mission was successful.","CNN quoted two people familiar with the assessment who said Iran's stockpile of uranium was not destroyed.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Monday extended its airspace ban on Indian aircraft for another month, citing ongoing tensions between the two countries following the Pahalgam terrorist attack and subsequent military operations.The ban, originally imposed on April 23, was first extended on May 23 after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7. The Indian military action targeted and reportedly dismantled several terror camps in Pakistan-administered territory, triggering four days of intense cross-border clashes that concluded with a ceasefire on May 10.A fresh Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) issued by the Pakistan Airports Authority now extends the restriction from June 23 to July 23. The notice states, “Pakistan airspace not available for Indian registered aircraft and aircraft operated/owned or leased by Indian airlines/operators including military flights.”The situation remains tense despite the end of direct hostilities. Diplomatic channels have yet to yield any breakthroughs in repairing the fractured bilateral relationship. Indian and Pakistani officials have not resumed formal dialogue since the flare-up.The initial ban followed the Pahalgam terrorist attack, which killed at least 26 people, further deepening mistrust and heightening military alertness on both sides.","The ban, originally imposed on April 23, was first extended on May 23 after India launched Operation Sindoor.

Pakistan Condemns U.S. Strikes On Iran A Day After Nobel Peace Prize Endorsement For Donald Trump





The Pakistani government and its powerful military establishment are facing a wave of public backlash after formally recommending US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, a move that drew widespread condemnation following the US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities.Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff. But the recommendation triggered a storm on social media after Trump ordered attacks on Iran’s Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear sites, an operation he called a “historic moment” and one that escalated regional tensions.On X (formerly Twitter), users accused the Pakistani government of appeasing its “master.” One user mocked, “Pakistanis, beware! After the attack on Iran, PM Shehbaz might not only award Trump the Nobel Peace Prize, but also Tamgha-e-Jurat, Tamgha-e-Shujaat, Tamgha-e-Basalat, Tamgha-e-Imtiaz, and perhaps even the Nishan-e-Haider!”Veteran journalist Ameer Abbas recalled that PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique had once likened Trump to Genghis Khan and Hitler.“Now, the same government nominates him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Who is orchestrating such shameful and cowardly decisions?” he asked.Raheeq Abbasi, political analyst and columnist, noted the irony, “Trump, who vetoed the Gaza ceasefire 8 times and is protested across the West for war crimes, is being nominated for a Nobel by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Is there no sense of honour left?”The backlash cut across ideological lines. Some users accused the military establishment of calling the shots. “The uncrowned kings are ready to sell out the nation whenever they please,” wrote Major (R) Asim.Another user, Jarjees Ahmad, called out the “supreme level of hypocrisy”, “We’re nominating someone involved in the massacre of Palestinians while claiming to stand with Iran.”Aamir Khan added, “What greater betrayal could there be to Muslims, our country, and the people of Pakistan?”The Pakistani government has yet to respond officially to the criticism.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff.

ISLAMABAD: In a move likely to stir diplomatic discussion across the region, the Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan govt announced on Saturday that it will formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, citing his diplomatic intervention during the recent India-Pakistan military crisis, reports Omer Farooq Khan.In an official statement shared on X, the Pakistan govt credited Trump's ""decisive intervention"" and ""pivotal leadership"" with helping de-escalate a rapidly intensifying standoff between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Islamabad said it responded with a calibrated military action - Operation Bunyanum Marsoos - described as a ""measured"" and ""precise"" strike intended to restore deterrence without targeting civilian areas.Pakistan's govt claimed Trump engaged both Islamabad and New Delhi through high-level diplomacy at a moment of heightened regional volatility, securing a ceasefire that averted a wider conflagration. ""President Trump demonstrated strategic foresight and statesmanship, preventing a broader conflict that could have had catastrophic consequences for the region,"" the statement read.The govt also praised Trump for his ""sincere"" willingness to assist in resolving the Kashmir dispute - an issue Pakistan maintains is central to lasting peace in South Asia.India, however, has consistently rejected third-party involvement in Kashmir, reiterating that the issue must be resolved bilaterally under the Simla Agreement.The Pakistani statement expressed hope that Trump's ""legacy of pragmatic diplomacy"" would continue to play a role in addressing global flashpoints, including the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and rising tensions involving Iran.Trump, who is yet to respond publicly, has previously highlighted his role in managing past India-Pakistan tensions, including in 2019 following the Pulwama-Balakot incident. His earlier offer to mediate on Kashmir was firmly rebuffed by New Delhi.The Nobel Peace Prize nomination process permits formal recommendations from heads of state, national lawmakers, and certain academic and diplomatic figures. The Norwegian Nobel Committee does not comment on individual nominations.If successful, Trump would join a select group of American leaders - US Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter, and Barack Obama - who have received the Nobel Peace Prize.","Pakistan to nominate US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.

'Could not Occur Without Money': FATF Condemns Pahalgam Attack; Pakistan's Return To Grey-List Soon?





A new report from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has cited a case involving Pakistan’s missile development programme, referencing a shipment seized by Indian customs officials in 2020 that was bound for Port Qasim in Karachi. The FATF case study outlines how dual-use goods, including equipment critical for ballistic missile technology, were mis-declared in export documents and linked directly to Pakistan’s National Development Complex, which is known to be involved in the development of long-range ballistic missiles.The FATF report reveals that Indian investigators intercepted a cargo ship falsely declaring autoclaves, equipment used for high-energy materials and missile motor components. “The Bill of Lading of the seized cargo provided evidence of the link between the importer and the National Development Complex,” the report noted.This latest disclosure comes as FATF increases its scrutiny of state-sponsored terrorism, particularly following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, which left 26 dead. In a public condemnation, FATF said: “This, and other recent attacks, could not occur without money and the means to move funds between terrorist supporters.”As per PTI sources, India is likely to use this FATF disclosure in its dossier to push for Pakistan’s return to the FATF grey list. The upcoming Asia Pacific Group meeting in August and the FATF plenary in October may see renewed calls for sanctions or monitoring. According to officials cited by PTI, the inclusion of “state-sponsored terrorism” in the FATF’s upcoming analysis marks a significant step in acknowledging Pakistan’s involvement in funding and facilitating terror operations.The incident flagged by FATF, which occurred in February 2020 at Kandla port, saw authorities act on intelligence regarding a suspicious Hong Kong-flagged ship, Da Cui Yun, that had departed from China’s Jiangyin port, TOI had reported. Officials seized a massive pressure chamber described as a pipe-like object, 35-40 feet in length, now confirmed to have potential ballistic missile applications. Experts from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) joined a high-level investigation into the cargo, amid tight-lipped responses from customs due to the national security implications.Also read: ‘Suspicious’ Chinese ship seized at Kandla, under strict scrutiny The FATF report also highlighted the growing global risk from proliferation financing (PF), especially concerning state and non-state actors acquiring dual-use technologies for weapons of mass destruction (WMD). “The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related financing represents a significant threat to global security and the integrity of the international financial system,” the report warns, adding that failure to implement effective controls could allow actors to exploit weaknesses in global export and financial systems.","A new report from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has cited a case involving Pakistan’s missile development programme.

ISLAMABAD: In a bid to recalibrate Pakistan’s global narrative and bolster ties with Washington, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States, meeting senior American scholars, strategic experts, and international media representatives during an official visit to Washington DC, the Pakistani military said on Friday.In a carefully choreographed diplomatic offensive, Munir interacted with leading think tanks and policy institutions, offering what officials described as “Pakistan’s principled perspectives” on evolving regional and global dynamics. His engagements underscored Islamabad’s renewed focus on international outreach amid a shifting geopolitical landscape in South Asia.The army chief reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to regional stability, counterterrorism, and a rules-based global order, pitching the country as a responsible actor in an increasingly multipolar world.Munir spoke at length about Pakistan’s counter-terrorism strategy, highlighting military operations such as Maarka-e-Haqa and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. He reminded his audience of Pakistan’s role as a frontline state in the global war on terror, citing the “immense sacrifices” borne by its security forces and civilians.Without naming India, Munir warned against “regional actors using terrorism as an instrument of hybrid warfare” – a familiar refrain in Pakistan’s diplomatic lexicon referring to its neighbour.While not new, the accusation resurfacing in the US capital, signalling Pakistan’s intent to shape the security discourse in South Asia.Munir also showcased Pakistan’s economic aspirations. He pitched the country’s untapped potential in IT, agriculture, and mineral wealth, calling on global stakeholders to invest in these “engines of shared prosperity”.From foreign policy to economic diplomacy, Munir portrayed Pakistan as a country pursuing dialogue, diplomacy, and international law — an image Islamabad has been keen to project as it seeks to distance itself from past reputational baggage.Discussing Pakistan-US relations, Munir called for transforming the historical security-centric engagement into a multidimensional partnership grounded in strategic convergence and mutual respect. He acknowledged past cooperation on counterterrorism and economic development but pushed for a broader framework of engagement.According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, participants appreciated the candid nature of the discussions and acknowledged Pakistan’s efforts to maintain regional stability. The meetings were seen as a trust-building exercise amid evolving US priorities in the Indo-Pacific region and growing scepticism over Islamabad’s commitments.The visit comes at a time when Pakistan is striving to reset ties with major powers, especially after its recent economic crises and shifting regional alignments. With India drawing closer to the US and Afghanistan remaining volatile, Islamabad is attempting to reposition itself as an indispensable — if complicated — regional player.","Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States.

The warning comes amid increasing political friction between the federal and provincial governments.Gandapur suspended implementation of the recently passed provincial budget and instructed lawmakers not to submit any cut motions during Friday’s session. He added that a new strategy would be announced on Monday.“If we don’t pass the budget, the federal government could take control of the province under the pretext of a financial emergency,” Gandapur said, accusing Islamabad of conspiring to topple his government.He also lashed out at the federal authorities for what he described as “unjust treatment” of the province following the May 9, 2023, incidents. He alleged that the public mandate in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was stolen in the aftermath.“Our leader was unjustly jailed, and the way we were treated after May 9, followed by the theft of our mandate, is unacceptable.

ISLAMABAD: The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz, with whispers of backroom deals that could reshape the balance of power in South Asia and far beyond.What began as a one-hour lunch in the Cabinet Room turned into a two-hour marathon meeting that continued in the Oval Office, attended by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, special representative Steve Witkoff, and Pakistan NSA and Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Asim Malik.The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) handout flags counter-terrorism, trade, and peace, but the real stakes — against the backdrop of Iran-Israel airstrikes and India-Pakistan tensions — reveal a high-wire act with far-reaching implications.Trump, channeling his trademark deal-maker bravado, now sees Pakistan as a strategic prize. As Israel intensifies strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and Washington edges closer to military escalation, Pakistan’s shared border with Iran becomes critical. Sources say Trump privately pressured Munir for airspace access and intelligence on Tehran — leveraging Pakistan’s backchannel role as the host of Iran’s interests section for the US.In return, he offered advanced weaponry and economic incentives, aiming to lure Islamabad away from China’s orbit and Russia’s Brics alliance.Trump’s push to expand trade in critical minerals, cryptocurrency, AI, and energy is part of a broader strategy to anchor Pakistan within US-led markets and curb China’s regional influence. He has also claimed credit for defusing the May 2025 crisis between India and Pakistan.As Pakistan’s power broker, Munir brings serious leverage. His military’s fight against Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) syncs with US aims in Afghanistan. With ties to Iran and a shared border, Munir can offer covert intelligence or logistical support, though Pakistan’s pro-Iran rhetoric caps public alignment. Economically, he can unlock Pakistan’s mineral and tech potential for US investors, but treading too far risks Beijing’s wrath.On India, Munir’s role in brokering the May ceasefire – praised by President Trump – has been framed in Islamabad as a direct rebuttal of New Delhi’s allegations of Pakistani involvement in cross-border terrorism. With the country facing severe economic challenges, Munir is believed to have sought US military and financial assistance to modernise Pakistan’s armed forces and stabilise its economy. Trump’s openness to providing drones or missile defence systems could significantly alter the military balance with India. Munir also reportedly urged Trump to de-escalate growing tensions between Iran and Israel, warning of broader regional instability and citing Pakistan’s vocal alignment with Tehran. In a bold diplomatic gesture, Munir extended an invitation for Trump to visit Pakistan, an effort seen as central to reshaping bilateral ties and enhancing Islamabad’s global relevance.Timed amid Middle East turmoil and South Asian friction, the Trump-Munir summit is a geopolitical pivot. It signals a fragile US-Pakistan thaw, driven by Washington’s ally hunt and Pakistan’s economic crunch. For India, it’s a call to counter a US strategy cosying up to both rivals while eyeing Iran. Trump’s deal-making and Munir’s strategic charm aim to reposition Pakistan as a US cornerstone, potentially redrawing South Asia’s power map at India’s expense. Wednesday’s White House talks weren’t just diplomacy, they were a bold move in a high-stakes regional chess game.","The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz.

LONDON: A high court judge here has struck out a libel claim brought by the UK branch of Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) against multimillionaire Tory peer Rami Ranger but allowed the claim against him brought by the US SFJ’s general counsel, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, to continue.The£500,000 (Rs 5.8 crore) libel claimcentres on an interview Ranger, chairman of the British Sikh Association, gave “Pakistan Daily” in 2021 and a tweet in which he alleged SFJ and Pannun were funded by “the enemies of India”. Ranger is quoted in the article as saying: “They are misleading the public that there are atrocities in Punjab and Sikhs are being badly treated, and all that nonsense, in order to capture the money which is coming to gurdwaras. ”The article was published on Nov 30, 2021 with the headline “Lord Ranger questions faith, funding of Sikh separatist leader”.Both SFJ UK and Pannun, a New-York based attorney, who India has designated as terrorist, claimed the article damaged their reputations and sought damages and an injunction. They pleaded that the meaning of the article was that they “are agents of and are funded by Pakistan and ISI and are therefore dishonest about the source of their funding”, and that Pannun “is deliberately misleading the public about the atrocities and ill-treatment suffered by Sikhs in the Punjab in order to illegitimately take money from the gurdwaras”.Justice Jay described the case as a “storm in a teacup”. He struck out the claim by SFJ UK in its entirety, saying that the entire article was about the US-based SFJ and SFJ UK was not mentioned, even though David Lemer, representing the claimants, had sought to argue the context inferred SFJ UK.With reference to the “enemies of India”, he said it is “well known Pakistan is the main enemy of India and vice versa” but added that “there is nothing in the article to suggest Pakistani ISI is somehow involved… or that these claimants are agents of Pakistan. To be funded by Pakistan is not defamatory.”He refused Lemer permission to appeal and SFJ UK was ordered to pay Ranger’s legal costs/Nayaz Qazi, who works for Ranger, told TOI outside court: “It is shocking that these frivolous allegations brought by SFJ and Pannun were used against Rami Ranger in deciding the revocation of his CBE.”","Rami Ranger, chairman of the British Sikh Association, gave an interview to ‘Pakistan Daily’ in 2021.

French prosecutors on Tuesday charged a British man with crimes including money laundering and identity theft, following his alleged involvement in a disturbing event at Disneyland Paris, where he reportedly staged a fake wedding ceremony , acting as the groom to a nine-year-old Ukrainian girl.Prosecutors stated that the 39-year-old man, whose name has not been disclosed, is a convicted sex offender and is currently wanted by authorities in the UK. He allegedly staged it for some sick social media stunt.According to Meaux prosecutor Jean-Baptiste Bladier, the British citizen is currently wanted in the UK for failing to meet the requirements of the country’s sex offenders register.He was taken into custody early Saturday morning after police were called to the theme park by a “guest” who said that the man had hired him to portray the bride’s father in the staged ceremony, reported BBC.The man said he had been paid €12,000 to play the role and that he only realised at the last minute that the ""bride"" was a child, according to a statement by Meaux prosecutor Jean-Baptiste Bladier.The New York Post reported that the venue had been privately booked for the event, at an estimated cost of $150,000, but Disneyland Paris staff intervened and halted the ceremony after realizing the “bride” was a 9-year old girl.Authorities said the British man was arrested along with three others: a 24-year-old Latvian woman pretending to be the bride’s sister, the 9-year-old girl’s 41-year-old mother, and a 55-year-old Latvian man who had been brought in to take part in the ceremony.“We all thought we were going to attend a wedding … Everyone was stunned, no one expected it,” one of the hired extras told.The guests who were hired were reportedly told they were being paid to participate in an upscale wedding rehearsal.The “scared and confused” little girl was spotted wearing a wedding dress and 5-inch heels “taped to her feet” when she showed up to the park, Le Parisien reported.The statement put out by authorities also noted that the Ukrainian girl, who had arrived in France two days prior, had not been subjected to physical or sexual abuse and was not ""forced to act"" as the bride.“The investigations, including the medical examination of the minor, a Ukrainian national, showed that she had not been subjected to any violence or coercive acts,” the prosecutor’s office said.Approximately 100 French extras were brought in to participate in the staged ceremony, which was planned to be filmed privately. The British man reportedly rented Disneyland Paris for several hours to play the groom. Preliminary findings said he had allegedly been ""made-up professionally so that his face appeared totally different from his own,"" according to the prosecutor, reported BBC.","A 39-year-old British man has been charged with money laundering and identity theft.

An Indian student studying at Northumbria University broke into a first-year female undergraduate's bedroom when she was not there and ejaculated on her belongings, including her teddy bears and bedcovers. UK media identified the offender as Udkarsh Yadav, who gained access to the victim's bedroom at the university accommodation by using a gym keycard that by mistake allowed him to access all rooms.When the victim returned to her accommodation, she found white substance on her soft toys. UK Express reported that Yadav admitted his offences and escaped with a suspended prison sentence, while the university demanded that he move to different accommodation.""Following his conviction he now faces being kicked off his course by university chiefs and sent home in shame,"" the report said.The university administration said there was an administrative error in the key cards and that was quickly resolved.It was, however, through the key card data that Yadav was found as the culprit and his DNA matched with the white substance in the victim's room.Prosecutor Jennifer Coxon told the court that Yadav admitted that he was ""overcome with desire"" and he was aware that the gym cards were set up incorrectly giving access to all rooms.The victim said she had her photos on the wall and she was worried that an unknown man had committed a sex act in her room. The report said she went to stay with a friend.Yadav admitted to burglary with intent to cause criminal damage.The incident took place earlier this year when the victim went to her home for Christmas.The report said Yadav was sentenced to 14 months suspended for two years, with rehabilitation requirements, 200 hours unpaid work and £117 compensation for three Jellycat soft toys and bed covers.Yadav's lawyer Shada Mellor told the court that his father owns a construction business in India. “His behaviour on the day in question is wholly out of character,"" his lawyer argued saying that Yadav chose to study in the UK as he wants to succeed and leave a lasting impact on the world.","Udkarsh Yadav, an Indian student studying at Northumbria University, broke into a first-year female undergraduate's bedroom. He ejaculated on her belongings, including her teddy bears and bedcovers. Yadav admitted his offences and escaped with a suspended prison sentence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122029018,imgsize-18258,width-400,resizemode-4/122029018.jpg"

Data, Dreams and Dharma: Stanford GSB Commencement Speech 2025





In a rare joint address that felt more like a fireside conversation than a commencement speech, former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his wife, investor-philanthropist Akshata Murthy, took the stage at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business (GSB) to reflect on leadership, life, and the Eastern values that have guided them through power, politics, and parenthood.But it was one ancient Sanskrit word——that became the philosophical cornerstone of their address to the Class of 2025.“It’s a concept known in Sanskrit as Dharma,” Sunak explained. “The idea that we should gain our fulfilment from simply doing our personal duty, rather than from any rewards that may come with our efforts.”It was not just an abstract idea. Sunak revealed that Dharma was the principle that guided his decision to step into the chaos of British politics in 2022—after losing the Conservative Party leadership race, only to return weeks later as Prime Minister following Liz Truss’s resignation and a market meltdown.“At that point,” Sunak recalled, “a purely ambitious politician would have sat out the impossible situation. But Akshata reminded me: my Dharma was clear.”That invocation of duty over ambition—a far cry from the usual Machiavellian fare of Westminster—drew warm applause from the GSB audience. For a school known for producing Silicon Valley unicorns and global CEOs, the speech was a gentle, unexpected reorientation: success isn’t just about spreadsheets, scalability, and shareholder value.Sometimes, it’s about doing the right thing, even when it costs you.The speech was also deeply personal. Akshata and Rishi, both graduates of Stanford GSB’s Class of 2006, met during their time on campus. “This is literally where we met,” Murthy told the audience. “In the Schwab courtyard, to be precise.”Their anecdotes—him in “seriously uncool” cargo shorts, her dragging him along on runs—were a charming counterpoint to their more weighty themes. But even those early conversations, they said, were seeded with discussions about leadership, values, and Dharma.“We started talking about this idea without knowing it,” Murthy said. “At Arbuckle Café over breakfast… and whether 11am was too early for some ice cream for Rishi.”From Omicron to OmSunak drew on his COVID-era experience as Chancellor of the Exchequer to drive home a broader point: while data was critical, instinct—rooted in values—was what made the difference.“I used to find comfort in the idea that data could always provide a certain answer,” Sunak said. “But Akshata helped me see that data can’t look around corners. It can’t make the decision for you.”It was a lesson, he said, that helped him resist pressure for a second national lockdown in late 2021, when the Omicron variant emerged. While the experts were divided, Sunak trusted his intuition—and ultimately, his duty to protect not just lives, but livelihoods.The concept of Dharma wasn’t just for prime ministers. Murthy extended it to young people, particularly through initiatives like Lessons at 10 and The Richmond Project, both aimed at increasing youth numeracy and life skills across the UK. “Successes and failures are part of the package that comes with leadership,” she said. “Dharma isn’t just relevant in public service… it gives you the resilience and clarity to overcome whatever’s thrown at you without losing your way. ”The GSB audience—diverse, ambitious, and often torn between idealism and practicality—was urged to embrace the same principle. Not to obsess over outcomes, but to anchor themselves in purpose. “If you want to lead,” said Sunak, “it’s not a question of data or intuition. You’ve got to get comfortable with both.”That both Sunak and Murthy come from families steeped in Indian values added an additional layer to the message. As the daughter of Infosys founder Narayana Murthy, and as Britain’s first Indian-origin prime minister, they embodied a fusion of East and West, Silicon Valley and Westminster, tradition and modernity.In invoking Dharma, they weren’t just quoting a Sanskrit term—they were redefining global leadership with it.For a generation of graduates who will face climate breakdowns, AI disruption, political upheavals and moral dilemmas far more complex than case studies can capture, the message resonated:Don’t just optimise. Do your duty.Whether it’s in public service, entrepreneurship, or social impact, the world, they said, needs more leaders shaped not just by capital markets—but by Dharma.As the applause rang out and the tassels turned, Rishi and Akshata Murthy left the GSB stage not as power couple or policy wonks, but as philosopher-guides—reminding the next generation that greatness isn’t just built on ambition or data, but something older, deeper, and infinitely more enduring.A sense of duty.Or as the Bhagavad Gita would put it: “Karmanye vadhikaraste ma phaleshu kadachana” — “You have the right to perform your duty, but not to the fruits of your actions.”That, perhaps, is the ultimate graduation gift.","Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his wife, investor-philanthropist Akshata Murthy, took the stage at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business (GSB) to reflect on leadership, life, and the Eastern values that have guided them through power, politics, and parenthood.

'Historic step': UK MPs back assisted dying; bill heads to House of Lords,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/historic-step-uk-mps-back-assisted-dying-bill-heads-to-house-of-lords/articleshow/121977752.cms,"AP photo

'Heartbreaking stories'

Public support





Britain took a historic step toward legalising euthanasia on Friday as Members of Parliament (MPs) backed a controversial bill that would introduce assisted dying for terminally ill people.In the House of Commons, lawmakers voted 314 to 291 in favour of sending the proposal to the House of Lords for further consideration, following four hours of emotional debate.The outcome sparked celebrations among supporters gathered outside Parliament, who argued that legalising euthanasia would offer dignity and choice to people facing incurable illnesses at the end of their lives.At the same time, opponents at a nearby counter-protest voiced concerns that vulnerable individuals could be pressured into choosing death and called on lawmakers to instead prioritise improvements in palliative care.The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would allow assisted suicide in England and Wales for adults diagnosed with less than six months to live. Under the proposed law, individuals would need to self-administer the life-ending medication, and their decision would require approval from two doctors and a panel of experts.If passed, the bill would bring Britain in line with several countries in Europe and elsewhere — such as Belgium and the Netherlands — that have already legalised some form of assisted dying.Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, who introduced the bill, told Friday’s third reading debate that changing the law would “offer a compassionate and safe choice” to terminally ill people.She argued that keeping the current ban in place would result in more “heartbreaking stories” of “pain and trauma, suicide attempts, PTSD, lonely trips to Switzerland, (and) police investigations.”However, Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft raised concerns that the bill did not include strong enough safeguards to protect disabled individuals.“We have to protect those people who are susceptible to coercion, who already feel like society doesn't value them, who often feel like a burden to the state, society and their family,” she said.Outside Parliament, demonstrators held placards with messages such as “Let us choose” and “Don’t make doctors killers.”David Walker, 82, shared his personal story of supporting the bill after witnessing his wife suffer for three years toward the end of her life.“That’s why I’m here, because I can’t help her anymore, but I can help other people who are going through the same thing, because if you have no quality of life, you have nothing,” he told AFP.But Elizabeth Burden, a 52-year-old doctor, warned that the legislation could lead to a “slippery slope” where eligibility for assisted dying might expand.“Once we allow this. Everything will slip down because dementia patients, all patients... are vulnerable,” she told AFP.MPs had initially backed an earlier version of the bill in November by 330 to 275 votes. Since then, several changes have been made, including a ban on advertising assisted dying and provisions allowing all healthcare workers to opt out of participating in the process.Lawmakers also added a safeguard to prevent eligibility “solely as a result of voluntarily stopping eating or drinking,” effectively ruling out cases such as people with anorexia.Britain’s medical community remains divided, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s cabinet is also split. His health and justice secretaries have publicly opposed the proposed law.However, public support appears strong. A YouGov poll of 2,003 adults, conducted last month and published on Thursday, found that 73 per cent of respondents supported the introduction of an assisted dying law.The bill now moves to the House of Lords, which must approve the legislation before the end of the current parliamentary year, likely in the autumn, or it will lapse.If passed and granted royal assent, the law would take approximately four years to implement before assisted dying services become available.A government impact assessment published this month estimated that between 160 and 640 assisted deaths could take place in the first year, potentially rising to 4,500 annually within a decade.Assisted suicide is currently illegal in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, carrying a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.Meanwhile, a separate assisted dying bill is progressing through the devolved Scottish Parliament. In March, the Isle of Man became the first British territory to pass an assisted dying bill.",MPs vote 314 to 291 in favour of sending the bill to the House of Lords for further consideration. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would allow assisted suicide in England and Wales for adults diagnosed with less than six months to live. Opponents say vulnerable individuals could be pressured into choosing death.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121978028,imgsize-79176,width-400,resizemode-4/121978028.jpg"
Mehul Choksi sues India in UK high court for ‘kidnapping him’ in Antigua,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/mehul-choksi-sues-india-in-uk-high-court-for-kidnapping-him-in-antigua/articleshow/121961131.cms,"Mehul Choksi

'Mehul Choksi's Extradition To India Will Be Tough' Says Former CBI Director

LONDON: Fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi is suing the Indian govt and five other people in the London high court for orchestrating what he refers to as his “kidnapping” from Antigua in 2021 in an alleged honeytrap plot.Choksi has claimed in the preliminary hearing that five people working for R&AW kidnapped him in Antigua and smuggled him on a yacht to Dominica in a plot masterminded by the Indian state in order to extradite him to India to face charges in the Rs 13,500 Punjab National Bank scam.Antigua police named Gurdip Bath, Barbara Jarabik, Gurmit Singh, Gurjit Singh Bhandal and Leslie Farrow-Guy as the five suspects, mostly UK-based, in the kidnapping. They are all being sued by Choksi alongside the Indian govt. They all deny the charges.The court documents were served on the ministry of external affairs by the British high commission in New Delhi.Edward Fitzgerald KC, representing Choksi (66), told Justice Freedman on Monday that Choksi was filing a civil suit against the Indian govt for allegedly ordering Choksi to be kidnapped on May 21, 2021 and smuggled by yacht to Dominica.India denies any involvement, argues it is protected by state immunity and that the UK courts do not have jurisdiction for this case.Harish Salve KC, representing India’s govt, said: “There is no evidence of India having anything to do with the alleged events. The claimant’s account is rife with non sequiturs and unsupported assumptions. Those accused seem a rather unlikely band of state-sponsored conspirators.”Choksi is currently in jail in Belgium where he is fighting extradition proceedings brought by India.Choksi first met Barbara Jarabik, a Hungarian luxury goods expert, in Antigua in Aug 2020. In May 2021 she is alleged to have asked him to visit the apartment she had rented in Jolly Harbour.A group of men of Indian origin burst into the apartment and told Choksi he was “being detained to be interrogated by Indian agencies”, Fitzgerald told the court, London’s Times newspaper reported.Choksi alleges that the men told him they worked for R&AW and beat him up, left him unconscious, and tied him to a wheelchair on the yacht to Dominica to extort a false confession from him and implicate the Congress party.“The evidence points inevitably to India being behind this — they had the motivation, they had the resources,” Fitzgerald told the court, the Daily Telegraph reported.Choksi denies the charges against him. Thenext hearing is expected in September.",Fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi is suing the Indian govt and five other people in the London high court.

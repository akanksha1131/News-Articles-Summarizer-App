British Muslim Journalist Sami Hamdi set to be released after ICE detention; wife demands justice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/british-muslim-journalist-sami-hamdi-set-to-be-released-after-ice-detention-wife-demands-justice/articleshow/125237919.cms,"



British Muslim journalist Sami Hamdi, who was arrested by US federal immigration authorities, is set to be released and allowed to return to the UK after being held for more than two weeks.On Monday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) said he had opted to accept a US govt offer to leave the country voluntarily, CNN reported.Hamdi, a London-based commentator visiting the United States on a speaking tour, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on October 26 as he passed through San Francisco International Airport. Authorities informed him that he was being held for overstaying his US visa.Muslim advocacy groups contend that his visa was revoked without cause or prior notice during his trip. Hamdi’s family believe the decision was driven by his public criticism of Israel’s actions in the Palestinian territories.“The government has agreed to release Sami,” Hamdi’s family said in a statement posted on social media Monday. “He will be able to return home soon insha’Allah.”Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CNN that Hamdi had voluntarily requested removal from the US and that ICE was “happily arranging his removal from this country.”McLaughlin characterised Hamdi as “an illegal alien and terrorist sympathizer” and said “Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country. ”ICE records show Hamdi remained in custody in California Monday afternoon. He was detained a day after speaking at CAIR’s annual gala in California.CAIR’s California chapter and Hamdi’s lawyer welcomed the US decision to release the British national. “This agreement establishes that the government does not consider Hamdi a danger to the community or to national security,” the statement read.On Friday, Hamdi’s wife Soumaya said the US government provided “no evidence” to justify his detention. “If they want him out of the country, why not simply let him go?” she posted to Instagram. “Why is the US government holding a British journalist without charge?”Hamdi is known for his analysis of Middle East developments and appearances on British television. He recently spoke about the US-brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza and international plans for the enclave’s post-war governance. At an event in London in 2023 following Hamas’ October 7 attack, he called on the audience to “celebrate the victory.” In a speech the following year hosted by the Canadian Muslim Public Affairs Council, he said that “no one is saying October 7 was right” and that “People are saying October 7 was a natural consequence of the oppression that is being put on the Palestinians. ”“It is this simple: Sami never should have spent a single night in an ICE cell,” CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush said on Monday. “His only real ‘offense’ was speaking clearly about Israel’s genocidal war crimes against Palestinians.”Hamdi is among the latest pro-Palestinian foreign nationals whose visas were revoked by the Trump administration. Earlier this year, Cornell graduate student Momodou Taal had his visa revoked and was targeted for deportation. The dual UK-Gambian citizen accused the Trump administration of targeting him for participating in pro-Palestinian protests amid the Israel-Hamas war. In late March, Taal announced he would voluntarily leave the US.","British journalist Sami Hamdi is set to be released and allowed to return to the UK after being held for more than two weeks.

US President Donald Trump on Monday demanded US air-traffic controllers return to work and offered a $10,000 bonus to those who had stayed on the job without pay during the government shutdown.The shutdown, which began October 1 and was now the longest in history, had meant 13,000 controllers, 50,000 TSA agents, and more than a million other govt workers went without pay for over a month, prompting some to call in sick, take leave or otherwise not show up for work.“All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!!! Anyone who doesn’t will be substantially ‘docked’,” Trump raged on social media.He went on to offer a bonus of $10,000 to controllers who worked unpaid during the shutdown, describing them as “great patriots.“For those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU,” Trump said.Jimmy Kimmel’s delusional wife is yet another self-important lib willing to sacrifice family ties for politicsOfficials said it was unclear under the controllers’ union contract how they could be docked or what the source of the $10,000 bonus Trump promised was.""

The situation was expected to worsen this week, New York Post reported.The FAA had instructed airlines to cut 4% of their daily flights starting last week at 40 major airports based on air-traffic-control safety concerns caused by staffing issues amid the shutdown. Reductions in flights were mandated to reach 6% on Tuesday and then hit 10% on Friday.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said he first wanted to see air-traffic-control staffing and safety data improve before the govt-required flight cuts were lifted.The Senate took the first step towards ending the shutdown Sunday evening, with Congress set to take final votes on reopening the govt later this week.","US President Donald Trump demanded US air-traffic controllers return to work and offered a $10,000 bonus to those who had stayed on the job without pay during the government shutdown.

"'People are pissed': Democrats fume over Senate shutdown deal, blame Chuck Schumer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/people-are-pissed-democrats-fume-over-senate-shutdown-deal-blame-chuck-schumer/articleshow/125237395.cms,"U.S Senate Emergency: Chuck Schumer Makes Big Shutdown Offer To Republicans; 'Waiting For Yes'





A private House Democratic caucus call on Monday turned into a heated airing of grievances, as lawmakers vented frustration at a group of Senate Democrats who cut a bipartisan deal with Republicans to reopen the government.According to multiple members on the call, more than a dozen Democrats spoke — nearly all sharply critical of the compromise struck in the Senate. The mood, one lawmaker said, was “furious.”Rep Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) told colleagues, “People are f**king pissed.” One participant said nearly “everyone [was] strongly against” the deal, according to the Axios.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) instructed members to keep criticism directed at Republicans and to avoid targeting “a few individuals in the Senate,” according to three lawmakers on the call. Rep Susie Lee (D-Nev.), the leadership representative for members in battleground districts, likewise urged colleagues to focus shutdown-related attacks on Republicans, not fellow Democrats.The fury followed Sunday’s vote by eight Senate Democrats to advance a bill that would reopen the government. The deal struck with Republicans promises a Senate vote next month on renewing expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits.However, the bill requires 60 votes to pass and offers no guarantee of a House vote, making its success uncertain.Roughly half of those who spoke on Monday’s call either directly criticised Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) or concurred with earlier speakers who lambasted him, sources said.Indian-origin RO Khanna blamed Schumer after several Senate Democrats cut a deal with Republicans aimed at ending the government shutdown and called for him to step aside from his leadership post in Washington.“He's the leader of the Senate. This deal would never have happened if he had not blessed it. Don't take my word for it. Take the word of other senators who are saying that they kept Sen. Schumer in the loop the whole time,” Khanna said in an interview with CBS News’ “The Takeout.”He continued: “Look, I've worked with Sen. Schumer. He did an incredible job on the CHIPS Act, on the [Inflation Reduction Act], on infrastructure. But it's time for him to be replaced. He is not meeting the moment. He's out of touch with where the party's base is.”Rep Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) argued that Schumer either “can’t control his caucus” or he “gave his blessing” to the deal. A spokesperson for Senator Schumer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Despite widespread anger among progressive and moderate House Democrats, some of the party’s most centrist members indicated openness to the Senate deal. As the call began, Rep Jared Golden (D-Maine), a retiring centrist who has opposed his party’s shutdown strategy, signalled support. “Congressman Golden’s position on using a government shutdown as a legislative strategy has been clear and has not changed,” a spokesperson told Axios, while stressing his support for extending ACA tax credits.Lee said on the call that she remained undecided on the bill even as Jeffries declared his opposition and vowed to fight it.","Private House Democratic caucus call on Monday turned into a heated airing of grievances.

Hundreds of cops resign ahead of Zohran Mamdani’s term in NYC: ‘How do you work for a mayor who wants to defund police?’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hundreds-of-cops-resign-ahead-of-zohran-mamdanis-term-in-nyc-how-do-you-work-for-a-mayor-who-wants-to-defund-police/articleshow/125193007.cms,"‘CITY THAT DEVOURS MAYORS’: Zohran Mamdani Faces BRUTAL Reality Of Running NYC | EXPLAINED

Workforce in numbers









New York City police officers are leaving the force in growing numbers, with morale sinking ahead of socialist Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral inauguration, according to the New York Post.NYPD figures show a 35 per cent rise in officer departures in October, with 245 officers quitting compared to 181 in the same month last year, according to Police Pension Fund data.“Morale is down because everyone is concerned about the policies Mamdani wants to put in place,” said Detectives Endowment Association President Scott Munro. “You have a person who is supposed to be running New York City that does not believe in law enforcement. What’s coming out of everyone’s mouth is, ‘We’re in trouble.’”The Police Benevolent Association warned that attrition could worsen. “Every single month, we’re losing enough cops to staff an entire precinct,” PBA President Patrick Hendry said. “It will certainly get worse if our city leaders don’t work with us to fix our unsustainable workload, our expired contract and the constant second-guessing that is driving good cops away from the job.”New hires have helped cover up some of the losses. The NYPD has recruited 2,911 new officers this year, the highest in a single year since 2006, with the next class scheduled for December. The department currently has 33,745 uniformed officers, down slightly from 33,812 in 2024. Peak staffing was 40,285 in 2000, according to Independent Budget Office data.Concerns are mounting that Mamdani’s proposed reforms could further strain the force. The mayor-elect wants to create a Department of Community Safety to dispatch mental health professionals to crisis calls and shift disciplinary power to the Civilian Complaint Review Board.“How’s that going to work when the person pulls out a gun or a knife?” a Bronx cop questioned.Former and current officers voiced frustration at Mamdani’s past comments calling cops racist and homophobic. “How do you work for somebody who considers you racist and anti-queer and wants to defund the police? Things are hard enough already. If you’re eligible to leave, why would you want to stay in that situation?” said a retired officer.A police union consultant warned recruitment could become increasingly difficult. “Nobody wants to be a New York City cop. It’s not worth the money, the stress, the danger, especially working for a mayor who wants to take the department apart,” the source told the New York Post.","NYPD figures show a 35 per cent rise in officer departures in October, with 245 officers quitting compared to 181 in the same month last year. “Morale is down because everyone is concerned about the policies Mamdani wants to put in place,” said Detectives Endowment Association President Scott Munro.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125193072,imgsize-1148308,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

What we know so far:

How Trump reacted?

Thune says 'the deal is coming together'



What is in the deal?



What would be next step if vote succeeds





US senators on Sunday reached an agreement to reopen the government after 40 days, signaling an end to the lengthy shutdown.A group of at least eight Senate Democrats, in consultation with Senate GOP leaders and the White House, reportedly reached a deal on Sunday to end the 40-day US government shutdown in exchange for a future vote on extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.The Senate is expected to vote on the proposal between 8:30 and 9 pm ET (7:30 am IST Monday).President Donald Trump, who arrived at the White House from the Commander’s game, told reporters that the shutdown will end soon.""Looks like we're getting very close to the shutdown. We'll never agree to give any substantial money or any money to really prisoners, illegals that come into our country,"" Trump said."" And I think the Democrats understand that. And it looks like we're getting close to the shutdown ending. You'll know very soon,"" he added.Senate Republican Leader John Thune said a test vote was “coming together” as he prepared to put forward a narrow spending package. He cautioned, “We’ll see kind of where the votes are. This kind of stuff can drag on indefinitely if you allow it to.” He told reporters earlier that the chamber planned to vote on the House-passed funding measure to reopen the govt, along with a handful of year-long funding bills.The procedural motion has fallen short of the 60-vote threshold 14 times.According to CNN and CBS News, the deal was led by Sens Angus King of Maine, and Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, in coordination with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the White House.Under its terms, the Senate would vote on a Democrats’ bill concerning the Affordable Care Act by the end of the second week of December. The agreement also calls for the reversal of all shutdown-related layoff notices and extends the stopgap funding measure through January, among other provisions.Meanwhile, NBC news reported that the agreement contains a package of bills, known as a “minibus” — three full-year appropriations bills that will fund certain departments like Agriculture through the end of the fiscal year next fall — and a continuing resolution to fund the rest of the govt at existing spending levels through January 30.It also fully funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, once known as food stamps, through next September, a major flashpoint in the shutdown, according to sources. The sources said the deal also reverses Trump’s attempted layoffs of federal workers during the shutdown through RIFs, or “reduction in force” notifications.As per NBC, in a major concession from Democrats, it does not include an extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. Allowing the funds to lapse would raise insurance premiums for millions of Americans unless they are extended. Instead, the Democrats settled for a promise that the Senate will vote on a bill to extend the subsidies by the end of the second week of December, with the outcome uncertain, two of the sources said.Even if Sunday’s vote succeeds, the shutdown may not end immediately. House Democrats would need to approve the package, and their support was not assured. The Associated Press reported that necessary Democratic backing remained uncertain, in part because many Democrats continue to demand a one-year extension of the ‘Obamacare’ subsidies for low-income Americans in return for reopening the govt.Republicans need only five Democratic votes to clear the Senate threshold, and around 10 to 12 Democrats have been involved in the talks. Critics within their ranks have said the emerging deal falls short. If the Senate passes the amended package, it must still clear the House of Representatives and be signed by President Trump, a process that could take several days.","US senators on Sunday reached an agreement to reopen the government after 40 days, signaling an end to the lengthy shutdown.

Oman extends expat resident card validity up to a maximum of 10 years - what changed and what it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/oman-extends-expat-resident-card-validity-up-to-a-maximum-of-10-years-what-changed-and-what-it-means/articleshow/125215594.cms,"Oman extends expat resident card validity to 10 years / AI-generated illustration

What the new law changes for residents?

The previous maximum validity for an expat resident card was three years.



The new maximum validity is up to 10 calendar years from the date of issuance or renewal.



Fees and renewal

Service Cost Period Covered Issuance/Renewal RO 5 (Omani Riyals) per year Up to 10 years maximum Replacement (Lost or Damaged Card) RO 20 (Omani Riyals) flat fee N/A

Why is the 10-year card a game changer?

Reduces Red Tape: Frequent trips to government offices and endless paperwork for renewals are significantly minimized. This boosts operational efficiency for both the ROP and the employers.



Attracts Investment: Simplifying long-term residency makes Oman a far more appealing destination for foreign investors, high-value entrepreneurs, and top-tier professionals seeking stability for themselves and their families.



Fosters Stability: The longer validity period offers genuine peace of mind and long-term security to Oman’s large expatriate community, which includes roughly 1.8 million individuals working across the private sector, government, and domestic roles.



Modernization: This change aligns Oman's civil status processes with international best practices, similar to how the ROP simultaneously confirmed that the Omani national identity card validity remains at 10 years, matching the national passport duration.



Conclusion





Oman’s Royal Oman Police (ROP) has amended the executive rules for civil status so resident identity cards for expatriates can have longer validity, now up to 10 years in some cases, and Omani national ID cards are extended to 10 years as well. Fees were simplified: the resident-card cost is RO 5 per year (with total cost depending on chosen validity length) and replacing a lost or damaged card is RO 20. Cardholders must renew within 30 days of expiry. Several local outlets report slightly different references to the implementing decision number; the change was announced by the ROP’s leadership and has been widely published.The change was made official by the Royal Oman Police (ROP) under Decision No. 157/2025. This decree amends provisions of the Executive Regulations of the Civil Status Law.The key change is simple but powerful:The decision was issued by His Excellency Lieutenant General Hassan bin Mohsen Al-Shuraqi, the Inspector General of Police and Customs, reflecting the government's high-level commitment to streamlining services.Crucial Caveat: While the card can be issued for up to 10 years, this will apply to specific categories and controls to be determined and regulated by the Director General of the ROP.This suggests that certain long-term residents, investors, or highly skilled professionals may be the first beneficiaries of the full 10-year term.To support the extended period, the ROP has also simplified the fee structure, making it straightforward for residents and employers to plan for the long term:This means a resident opting for a five-year card, for example, would pay RO 25 (5 years * RO 5/year).Renewal Deadline: The ROP requires all cardholders to renew their documentation within 30 days from the date of its expiry to remain fully compliant with the Civil Status Law.This new structure replaces a previous decision issued just months ago, which offered flexible one-, two-, and three-year options. The adoption of the 10-year maximum showcases a faster-than-expected push toward long-term residency solutions.This administrative reform has immediate and powerful implications for Oman’s economy and its residents:By embracing this 10-year residency option, Oman signals a commitment to cultivating a stable, efficient, and welcoming environment for those who contribute to its development.Oman’s decision to extend the validity of expat resident cards up to 10 years is more than just an administrative update—it’s a powerful statement of intent. By offering a decade of stability, the Sultanate is not only easing the lives of its current residents but is actively shaping its future.This move signals to the world that Oman is committed to a modern, efficient, and welcoming system for attracting and retaining the long-term talent and investment crucial for its Vision 2040 goals. For the expatriate community, the new 10-year resident card means less bureaucracy, more security, and a greater sense of belonging in the Sultanate.",Oman’s Royal Oman Police (ROP) has amended the executive rules for civil status so resident identity cards for expatriates can have longer validity. The new maximum validity is up to 10 calendar years from the date of issuance or renewal.

Biometric Crackdown: Green Card Holders Face New Rules as US Tightens Immigration Security

Also read:





: Foreign nationals seeking to immigrate to the United States could now be denied visas and green cards based on pre-existing chronic health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, under new guidance issued by the Trump administration.The directive, which significantly expands the criteria for who is deemed a potential ""public charge,"" has been sent by the State Department on to US embassies and consular offices worldwide.A cable sent by the State Department to visa officers instructs them to flag applicants whose medical conditions could require ""hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of care."" The list of conditions cited includes, but is not limited to cardiovascular diseases; respiratory diseases; cancers; diabetes; metabolic diseases; neurological diseases; and mental health conditions.The guidance also specifically advises officers to consider conditions like obesity, noting that it can lead to costly complications such as asthma, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure. All these chronic illnesses are now being assessed as potential indicators that an individual might become a future financial burden on the United States.The policy shift, revealed on Thursday, is one of the most aggressive moves in the administration’s broader immigration crackdown, effectively linking an applicant’s health status to their eligibility for entry.It was not immediately clear if the directive applies to tourist and student visas. While it technically applies to all visa applicants, including those seeking non-immigrant visas for tourism (B-1/B-2) and studies (F1), it is expected to be primarily used for those seeking to permanently reside in the US.As things stand, tourist visa applicants are required to demonstrate they have sufficient financial means for their trip; they intend to leave the US at the end of their authorized stay; and they will not become a ""public charge"" during their temporary visit.At the heart of the new guidance is a stricter interpretation of the ""public charge"" rule—a century-old immigration provision designed to exclude those likely to become primarily dependent on government assistance. While health screenings have always been part of the visa process, traditionally focusing on communicable diseases like tuberculosis, the new directive vastly expands the list of conditions to be considered.Immigration advocates warn that the new rules grant consular officers, who lack medical expertise, sweeping authority to make subjective judgments about an applicant's long-term health since no one is expected to disclose their ailments in visa applications.Also read: Getting US visa could soon be harder for many – Who's affected? Under the new framework, visa officers are explicitly instructed to determine whether applicants have the financial resources to cover the costs of such long-term medical care ""over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense.""Immigration experts contend that this policy will dramatically reduce legal immigration for older applicants and those with common chronic illnesses.

‘They’ll Love Us Again’: Trump Confirms India-U.S Trade Deal Almost Done – Tariffs To Drop Soon!





US President Donald Trump on Monday said he would be reducing tariffs on India “at some point” because New Delhi had stopped or substantially reduced buying Russian oil.At an Oval Office ceremony for the swearing in of Sergio Gor as the new ambassador to India, Trump seemed aware of the enormous damage his policies and his approach have caused to bilateral relations, conceding, “So right now, they don't love me, but they'll love us again.”“We're getting a fair deal, just a fair trade deal. We had pretty unfair trade deals. They had very good negotiators there. We're getting close…I think we're pretty close to doing a deal that's good for everybody,” Trump said, without elaborating on when there will be an agreement and what is holding it up.His segue from “they've stopped doing the Russian oil” to “it's been reduced very substantially,” in the same breath suggested he is waiting for a certain level of reduction of Russian oil purchases with a concurrent uptick in purchase of U.S energy before he signs off on the deal.Unusually, Trump hosted Gor’s oath taking in the Oval Office, the ceremony attended by a phalanx of MAGA luminaries, some of whom had nothing to do with the India portfolio.Several liberal commentators savaged the event, calling it “creepy” “obsequious” and “Stalinesque” as several speakers, invited by Trump to make remarks, flattered him with what one observer called “North Korea level” sycophancy, with very little reference to India.Trump himself held forth on various other issues, including the government shutdown and ties with Syria, after brief boilerplate remarks on Gor’s mission to India.Asserting that he (Trump) has a “fantastic” relationship with Prime Minister Modi, the U.S President called India “an important economic and strategic security partner in the Indo-Pacific region,” even though, from all accounts, he has diminished the partnership with punitive tariffs on India (as compared to China and Pakistan) and his shoddy treatment of Quad, a group whose mission was to counter China’s influence in the region.“It (India) is an amazing country. Actually, 1.5 billion people. China is 1.4 billion. Those are two big countries. As Ambassador, Sergio will work to fortify our country's bond, promote investments in key industries and technologies, increase American energy exports and expand our security cooperation. And you know, we're making a deal with India, a much different deal, than we had in the past,” Trump said, having virtually ceded a co-equal peer position to China with repeated references to G-2 over the past fortnight.He said he was trusting Gor to strengthen “ one of our country's most important international relations, the strategic partnership with India,” adding “being the ambassador to India is a big deal.”Vice-president JD Vance, who formally administered the oath to Gor as per protocol, also tried to put some gloss on the damaged ties, saying, Gor would be a great ambassador to India, “which the President and I love.”Bizarrely, Trump said Gor has already become friendly with PM Modi, and knowing that he is going to be the ambassador “they would call constantly to say, let's get to know this man, and they like what they see.”“So I know you're going to have a great success over this,” he told Gor.The presence of a large number of MAGA luminaries was also a testament to Gor’s proximity to the President and his popularity and influence in the administration, prompting Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who would technically be his boss, to say, “it looks like there are 1.5 billion people in the Oval Office today.”Among those who spoke glowingly of Gor when they veered off from flattering Trump was former TV host Jeanine Pirro, attorney general for Washington DC, and Erika Kirk, widow of slain MAGA activist, Charlie Kirk.","US President Donald Trump said he would be reducing tariffs on India “at some point” because New Delhi had stopped or substantially reduced buying Russian oil. “We're getting a fair deal, just a fair trade deal.

"FBI director is said to have made pledge to head of MI5, then broken it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fbi-director-is-said-to-have-made-pledge-to-head-of-mi5-then-broken-it/articleshow/125238057.cms,"Kash Patel





At a secret gathering in May, south of London, the head of UK’s domestic security service asked Kash Patel , the FBI director, for help. UK security officials rely on the bureau for high-tech surveillance tools — the kind they might need to monitor a new embassy that China wants to build near the Tower of London. The head of MI5, Ken McCallum, asked Patel to protect the job of an FBI agent based in London who dealt with that technology, according to some US officials with knowledge of the episode.Patel agreed to find funding to keep the posting, the officials said. But the job had already been slated to disappear as the White House moved to slash the FBI budget. The agent moved to a different job back in the US, saving the FBI money but leaving MI5 officials incredulous. It was a jarring introduction to Patel’s leadership style for British officials. They had long forged personal ties with their US counterparts, as well as with three other close allies, in an intelligence partnership known as the Five Eyes.The relationships among the organisations matter because many top national security officials view trust and reliability as paramount to sharing critical information with allies — vital for communication between agency directors, and hard to restore once lost.On the same day in 1946 that Winston Churchill delivered his Iron Curtain speech in the US, Britain and the US secretly signed the pact that formed the basis for their intelligence alliance. It was an outgrowth of their collaboration during World War II. The partnership expanded during the advent of the Cold War to include other countries — Australia, Canada and New Zealand — earning it the name Five Eyes.Patel’s inexperience, his dismissals of top FBI officials and his shift of bureau resources from thwarting spies and terrorism have heightened concerns among other Five Eyes nations that the bureau is adrift, according to the former US officials and those familiar with allies’ reactions to bureau changes.The shift under Patel has struck directly at the Five Eyes relationship through the removal of senior agents who spent years fighting extremists or blunting counter-intelligence threats alongside operatives from allied countries. FBI declined to comment on the director’s discussions with McCallum. A representative of the British home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, whom McCallum reports to, refused to comment.Patel’s trip to Britain in May was the kind of gathering that top national security officials regularly attend, a conference with other Trump administration officials and their Five Eyes peers to discuss such issues as counterterrorism and cybersecurity. Organisers also set aside time for the principals to meet to discuss specific investigations and to get acquainted.The gathering was relatively informal. McCallum, a Scot known for his discretion and mild manner who was close to Patel’s predecessor, Christopher A. Wray, was waiting. When McCallum asked Patel to keep the agent’s key position in London, Patel told him that it would not go away, and that money would be found to keep the agent in London, according to two of the former US officials familiar with the episode.But the funding for that position had already been cut before Patel left for Britain. It wasn’t clear whether Patel was aware of this at the time he made the pledge to MI5, the two former officials said. Patel ultimately didn’t re-allocate funds for the role because of the costs involved, according to three current and former US officials.","UK security officials rely on the bureau for high-tech surveillance tools.

Syria to join US-led coalition to defeat IS group: Report

Trump praises Al-Sharaa

What Syria said about meeting?

US partially waives Caesar Act sanctions on Syria after meeting







US President Donald Trump hosted Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa at the White House on Monday, welcoming Syria into a US-led global coalition to fight the Islamic State group. The meeting marked the first visit to the White House by a Syrian head of state since Syria gained independence from France in 1946.Al-Sharaa arrived at the White House around 11.30 am and shortly after began a closed meeting in the Oval Office. He entered via West Executive Avenue rather than the West Wing driveway normally used for foreign leaders’ arrivals. He left about two hours later, greeting a throng of supporters outside before getting into his motorcade, AP reported.Syria will join the international coalition to combat the Islamic State group, marking a shift in US foreign policy in the Middle East, according to BBC report.Diplomatic relations between Syria and the US have been suspended since 2012, although Trump has moved to restore them after the fall of the regime of Bashar al-Assad.The talks between the two countries focused on Syria’s role in defeating Islamic State, the reconstruction effort and the lifting of sanctions.“We’ll do everything we can to make Syria successful because that’s part of the Middle East,” Trump told reporters.The US president said of al-Sharaa that “I have confidence that he’ll be able to do the job.”“He’s a very strong leader. He comes from a very tough place, and he’s a tough guy,” Trump told reporters. “People said he’s had a rough past, we’ve all had rough pasts...And I think, frankly, if you didn’t have a rough past, you wouldn’t have a chance.”Trump said Syria was a “big part” of his plan for a wider Middle East peace plan, which the US president is hoping will prop up the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.Syria’s foreign ministry, in a statement, described the meeting as “friendly and constructive.” It said Trump “affirmed the readiness of the United States to provide the support that the Syrian leadership needs to ensure the success of the reconstruction and development process.”The statement added that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio then met with Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who arrived in Washington on Monday, and that they agreed to proceed with implementing an agreement reached in March between Damascus and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces to integrate the SDF into the new Syrian army. It was unclear what concrete steps were agreed.The statement said the American side also affirmed its support for reaching a security agreement with Israel, but did not say how Syria had responded.Trump and al-Sharaa first met in May in Saudi Arabia. At the time, the US president described al-Sharaa as a “young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past, very strong past. Fighter.” It was the first official encounter between the US and Syria since 2000, when then-President Bill Clinton met with Hafez Assad.The US partially suspended the imposition of Caesar Act sanctions on Syria for 180 days, the Treasury Department announced on Monday.The suspension replaces a May 23 waiver that also granted a 180-day exemption from mandatory Caesar Act sanctions and represents ""our commitment to continued sanctions relief for Syria,"" according to an advisory from the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).It halted the imposition of Caesar Act sanctions except for certain transactions involving the govts of Russia and Iran, or transfers of Russian-origin or Iranian-origin goods, technology, software, funds, financing, or services, the advisory said.Rubio, in a statement, said, ""Today, I issued a suspension of mandatory Caesar Act sanctions based on the actions taken by the Syrian government following the fall of the al-Assad regime.""""The suspension of Caesar Act sanctions supports Syria’s efforts to rebuild its economy, restore ties with foreign partners, and foster prosperity and peace for all its citizens,"" he added.While the Caesar Act sanctions are currently waived by Trump, a permanent repeal would require Congress to act.","US President Donald Trump hosted Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa at the White House on Monday.

Media MELTDOWN: Trump’s $1.5B Threat Sends BBC Into Crisis After ‘Fake’ Documentary Fallout | WATCH

Unedited remarks



Fallout







The BBC has been plunged into a massive row after broadcasting a Panorama documentary that showed a doctored version of US President Donald Trump’s January 6, 2021, speech.MAGA critics, including the White House, said the programme misleadingly portrayed Trump as inciting violence during the Capitol attack. The row over the clip has led to the resignations of BBC director-general Tim Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness.In the programme, titled Trump: A Second Chance, the edited clip shows Trump saying: “We’re gonna walk down to the Capitol, and I’ll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”The broadcast gave the impression that Trump was directly urging his supporters to storm the Capitol, inviting backlash of the BBC’s editorial choices.The unedited speech shows a very different message. Trump actually said: “We’re going to walk down, and I’ll be there with you, we’re going to walk down, we’re going to walk down any one of you but I think right here, we’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.”He also included instructions for peaceful action: “I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.”The contrast between the edited and unedited footage became the center point of the drama.Following the backlash, Tim Davie and Deborah Turness resigned from their positions.Trump reacted on his social media, posting: “The TOP people in the BBC, including TIM DAVIE, the BOSS, are all quitting/FIRED, because they were caught ‘doctoring’ my very good (PERFECT!) speech of January 6th. Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.’ These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!”The POTUS has put the BBC on notice, demanding a full retraction, apology, and compensation over the Panorama documentary. His legal team said the programme contained “false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements” and accused the broadcaster of causing “overwhelming financial and reputational harm.” Trump’s lawyers have given the BBC until November 14, 2025, to comply or face a civil lawsuit seeking at least $1 billion in damages. A BBC spokesperson said the broadcaster would review the letter and respond “in due course.""","The BBC has been plunged into a massive row after broadcasting a Panorama documentary that showed a doctored version of US President Donald Trump’s January 6, 2021, speech.

We had divers that entered the water and tried to search for any victims and didn’t find any.”Moser added that no homes were damaged in the crash and that federal aviation officials would investigate the cause.The plane had taken off from Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport at around 10:14 am, according to a spokesperson for the City of Fort Lauderdale, which owns and operates the airport. Coral Springs police officers and fire crews arrived at the scene at 10:19 am, just five minutes after takeoff.Broward County, where the plane took off and later crashed, is home to a large Caribbean American community that had been actively collecting relief supplies after Hurricane Melissa hit Jamaica as a Category 5 storm last month, causing major damage.The plane was on a humanitarian mission to deliver aid to communities affected by the hurricane.","Plane carrying hurricane relief supplies to Jamaica crashed into a pond in Coral Springs, a suburb of Fort Lauderdale.

In an interview with UnHerd, the 24-year-old Indian-origin MAGA voice said he was confused over religion in his childhood. His maternal grandparents who were almost his surrogate parents, followed Sikhism while his parents were Protestant Christians.Haley said he immersed himself in books on world religions to find out what he should follow when other kids of his age were reading about cars and dinosaurs. Eventually, he concluded that Christianity is the true faith but the conclusion was preceded by a spiritual experience that he did not detail in the interview.“I needed to research my own faith better in terms of the history, the early beliefs, the Church Fathers,” he said. “When I did that, I felt as though anyone who does that kind of research will walk away a Catholic.”The interview comes as Hindu Indian-origin politicians in the US are facing unprecedented attacks over their religion.

‘AMERICA WILL EXPLODE’: Schumer & Sanders On US Senate Floor Before ‘Shutdown Humiliation’ By Dems





US Democrats barely got a week to enjoy sweeping by-elections victories before bloodletting erupted between the party’s progressive wing and moderate centrists over a deal with Republicans to end the longest government shutdown in the country’s history.Eight moderate Democrats and one independent broke ranks to join Republicans in a 3am 60-40 vote that allowed passage of a clean continuing resolution (CR) to find government at current levels through February 14, 2026. The stop-gap measure secured none of the key Democratic priorities that had been demanded by the party’s progressive wing in exchange for keeping the government open, including an immediate extension for expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and new money for child care subsidies.Angry progressives on the left denounced the deal, calling it a surrender by the party’s leadership led by New York Senater Charles Schumer and Congressman Hakeen Jeffries. “This is not leadership; it’s liquidation,” raged NYC lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez outside the Capitol, flanked by progressive allies like Ilhan Omar and Jamaal Bowman. She argued that the shutdown pain was the “exact leverage we needed to force GOP concessions,” and accusing leadership of “trading the dignity of furloughed federal workers for a press release.Her mentor Bernie Sanders echoed the sentiment, saying, “Working families cannot eat bipartisanship… When Republicans demand austerity for the poor... Democrats must draw a line. Today we erased it. California governor Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 Presidential candidate, called the purported surrender “pathetic.”But moderates argued that internal polls showed independent voters, particularly in purple battleground states, blaming Democrats for the shutdown. Voting to reopen the government was the only adult option and Democrats can't win elections shutting off social security checks to grandma, they maintained, clawing back a loss of face within the party last week when NewYorkCity went far left. “Voters hired us to govern, not grandstand. Progressives mistake noise for power,” Kirsten Sinema, an independent who aligns with Democrats, asserted.The crises, inner-party for Democrats and nationwide for Americans, is far from over. Funding for the government is only till February 14 and all sides are girdling to resume battle 96 days from now in a process foreigners find mystifying. Hours after the deal, Pramila Jayapal, a raging radical lawmaker from Washington state, circulated a “No More Blank Checks” pledge, vowing to withhold votes on any future spending bill lacking Green New Deal benchmarks and student debt relief. More centrist lawmakers like California’s Ro Khanna were working to bridge the gap with a “People’s Budget” amendment, aiming to pair progressive priorities with centrist guardrails.A victorious President Trump meanwhile pledged a $2000 “tariff dividend” to Americans (excluding high income individuals), a direct rebate from revenues generated by his administration's sweeping tariff policies even as he denied they had raised the cost of living.","Eight moderate Democrats and one independent broke ranks to join Republicans in a 3am 60-40 vote that allowed passage of a clean continuing resolution to find government at current levels through February 14, 2026.

'Ethically problematic': Child-sex offender walks free after Trump’s Jan 6 pardon wipes out his jail time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ethically-problematic-child-sex-offender-walks-free-after-trumps-jan-6-pardon-wipes-out-his-jail-time/articleshow/125228232.cms,"



A Texas man who received a pardon from Donald Trump for his violent role in the January 6, Capitol riot has managed to avoid prison for child sex offences, after a judge credited him with the time he served for the riot before the pardon.37-year-old Andrew Taake pleaded guilty to soliciting what he believed was a 15-year-old girl for sex. The “girl” was actually an undercover police officer on a dating website. Despite the seriousness of the charge, Taake avoided a prison sentence because he had accumulated more than three and a half years of detention time from his earlier federal case. That case involved him attacking officers with bear spray and a metal whip during the Capitol riot. He was convicted for those actions, but his sentence was later wiped out when Trump issued a blanket pardon to more than 1,500 January 6 offenders on Inauguration Day.According to Harris County court records, Taake received 1,306 days of credit, most of which was from the period he spent in custody before he was sentenced for the riot last year. That credit was then applied to his unrelated state child solicitation case, allowing him to walk free with only a requirement to register as a sex offender for ten years.Lawyers told the Daily Beast that using time from a pardoned political crime to erase punishment for child exploitation was “exceptionally rare” and “ethically problematic”. Washington-based attorney Evan Oshan said the situation was especially concerning because it shifted credit “from a political or protest crime to child exploitation”.Taake’s behaviour on January 6 shocked even the judge overseeing his federal case. He sprayed officers in the face with a chemical irritant and carried a whip made of metal. Prosecutors argued that Taake showed no remorse and continued to portray himself as a patriotic hero.Taake had already been facing the solicitation charge before the riot. He was out on bond for sending explicit messages and photos to the undercover officer on Plenty of Fish dating app, continuing even after being told she was underage.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Sunday that it was committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban but demanded that Kabul must address concerns regarding the use of its territory by terrorists.Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi issued a statement on different media queries regarding the third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime in Istanbul on November 6, which concluded a day later. Turkiye and Qatar mediated the parleys.The peace talks ended without any agreement to tackle the thorny issues of cross-border terrorism , the top officials had said on Saturday.""Pakistan remains committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue. However, Pakistan's core concern, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needs to be addressed first and foremost,"" the FO said in a statement.It also said that Pakistan's Armed Forces and its people were well determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism from its soil and take action against its supporters, abettors and financiers.In the long statement, the spokesperson said that for the past four years, since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil.""Throughout these years, Pakistan, despite suffering military and civilian casualties, exercised maximum restraint and did not retaliate,"" it said.Pakistan's expectation was that the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna al Khawarij (TTP/FaK) elements present on Afghan soil, the FO said.The Pakistan government last year notified the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as ""Fitna al-Khawarij"", a reference to a group in earlier Islamic history which was involved in violence.Pakistan also tried to positively engage with Afghanistan by offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance, and the intention to constructively engage with Afghanistan so as to enable it to become a stable, peaceful and prosperous country that is at peace within and with its neighbours, the statement said.However, despite all these positive gestures, ""the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction,"" it added.Instead of acting upon the core expectation to stop Afghan territory from being used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions, it said.""Instead, it has tried to confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues. By confusing the main issue of terrorism, it keeps trying to develop a narrative which absolves the Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards the international community and its own people,"" it added.The statement said that Pakistan's October 2025 response to the consistent attacks emanating from Afghanistan was a manifestation of the will and determination that it will not leave any stone unturned to safeguard its territory and its people.The statement added that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK terrorists.Pakistan also accused the Afghan Taliban of using the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue, adding that they had fled in 2015 to avoid a military operation and fought together with the Afghan Taliban against Nato troops.""These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by the Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to the Afghan Taliban,"" it said, and added that the same terrorists established training camps in Afghanistan to launch terrorist activities in Pakistan.The FO rejected the Kabul excuse of lack of control over TTP and demanded definite and concrete actions. Pakistan also rejected the portrayal of TTP as refugees and asked Kabul to hand them over to Pakistan.It said Pakistan has never eschewed dialogue with any Government in Kabul, but it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group.",Pakistan says it is committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

What does it mean?



Opposition backlash and protests



Divided legal opinions



Support for reforms







Pakistan’s government has introduced a major constitutional change that has sparked widespread debate and protests across the country. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment, which will be voted on in Parliament next week, seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary, prompting strong criticism from the Opposition.The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s longest-serving de facto head of state, who introduced sweeping constitutional changes to entrench military control under a civilian façade. The proposed 27th Amendment, risks reviving that legacy by placing the armed forces once again at the centre of Pakistan’s political structure.The bill, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after cabinet approval, proposes to abolish the post of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC) and replace it with a new and more powerful position -- chief of defence forces (CDF).According to reports in Dawn, the post will be held by the serving chief of army staff, who will also become the constitutional head of the army, navy and air force. This change would make General Asim Munir the most powerful military officer in Pakistan’s history, formalising his recent promotion to Field Marshal.The amendment also includes plans to set up a new federal constitutional court (FCC) and change how high court judges are appointed.It seeks to transfer some powers from the Supreme Court to the new court, while also granting the president lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.Pakistan law minister Azam Nazir Tarar presented the bill in the senate, where chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred it to a committee led by Farooq Naek for review. Naek said the goal was to “create consensus among members” before the bill comes up for voting on Monday. The government is confident of securing a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the national assembly.Opposition parties have strongly opposed the amendment, calling it a direct threat to Pakistan’s Constitution. A coalition of opposition groups, the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes Imran Khan’s PTI, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) has announced nationwide protests starting Sunday.“Democratic institutions have been paralysed within Pakistan… the nation must step up against the [proposed] 27th Amendment,” MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said.PkMAP leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai said the protests would begin with the slogan: “Long live democracy, down with dictatorship.” He warned, “The opposition alliance had no choice but to launch a protest movement following the government’s move, which is shaking the foundations of the Constitution.”Legal experts are split on the amendment’s impact. Critics say it would reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, making it “irrelevant,” and tighten executive control over the judiciary.One senior counsel told Dawn, “Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’.”Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar warned that the changes would “empower [the new] Federal Constitutional Court by disempowering the Supreme Court.” He said the amendment also gives the Chief of the Defence Forces constitutional authority for life, formally recognising the Field Marshal rank.Another lawyer pointed out that under the new Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC would outrank the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and serve until the age of 68 -- three years longer than the current limit of 65.Some legal experts, however, have welcomed the changes. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar called the 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in Pakistan’s justice system.He said the plan to have two separate apex courts -- one for appeals (Supreme Court) and one for constitutional cases (FCC) -- would bring “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence.”He also argued that the reforms could reduce political influence in the judiciary, cut down case backlogs, and modernise the justice system.Khokhar added that the new defence structure under Article 243 was in line with “modern constitutional democracies,” ensuring that the armed forces would operate under a single advisory framework accountable to the prime minister, defence minister and National Security Committee.Newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association in Pakistan, President Haroonur Rasheed also supported the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court, saying it could help streamline the judicial process.","Proposed 27th constitutional amendment will be voted on in Parliament next week.

Pakistan on edge: Jaffar Express services suspended over security fears; thousands affected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-on-edge-jaffar-express-services-suspended-over-security-fears-thousands-affected/articleshow/125199650.cms,"Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups (AI image)

Blast Hits Jaffar Express in Pakistan, Several Injured

A train under siege



The months that followed saw a stream of attacks:

In October, a blast on the Sindh section of the railway line derailed five bogies and injured several passengers.

In September, an explosion on the track in Mastung derailed six coaches, leaving 12 injured.

In August, six coaches derailed after an improvised explosive device went off in Mastung, while days earlier a pilot engine came under gunfire.

In July and June, two separate blasts in Sindh derailed multiple coaches.

Late last year, a suicide bomber at Quetta Station killed at least 26 people.

One battle after another

Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday, citing “serious security concerns” in Balochistan, news agency PTI reported.The temporary suspension — enforced from 9 to 12 November — follows multiple insurgent attacks on the train over the past year, including a dramatic hijacking in March that left 26 people dead.Railway officials said the move came after fresh intelligence warnings of possible attacks targeting tracks, railway assets and civilian passengers. “The precautionary measure is based on advice from security and intelligence agencies to ensure the safety of passengers, railway staff, civilians and critical rail assets,” a senior official said, as quoted by PTI.The Jaffar Express is one of Pakistan’s busiest long-distance routes, carrying thousands of passengers daily at a cost far lower than road travel. Local commuters have criticised the shutdown, saying it leaves people in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with few affordable transport options.Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups, particularly the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).In March, BLA militants hijacked the train with 380 passengers on board, triggering a two-day standoff in a mountainous tunnel. Twenty-six people were killed before security forces rescued more than 350 passengers. Authorities said 33 militants also died in the rescue operation.Security officials say insurgent groups are increasingly targeting railways to cripple movement and signal the state’s inability to secure critical transport arteries. Analysts note that the frequency of attacks shows “a collapse of basic security control” across parts of Balochistan’s rail corridor.Political leaders in the province argue that Islamabad has ignored decades of local grievances. Balochistan National Party chief Akhtar Mengal recently warned that the state has “lost control” of the region, saying: “There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority.”The suspension comes as Pakistan faces one of its most dangerous security challenges in years. Not only has the BLA intensified operations across Balochistan, but attacks linked to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamic State Khorasan (ISK) and cross-border militants have surged.According to the latest Global Terrorism Index, Pakistan recorded a 45% jump in terrorism-related deaths this year. Security officials warn the country is now battling “four fronts at once”—an insurgent network straddling provincial, sectarian and cross-border lines.Diplomatic efforts have yielded little. Peace talks this week between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement, with both sides blaming each other for breakdowns in the ceasefire. Pakistan accuses Kabul of sheltering TTP fighters; the Taliban dismisses the allegations.","Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday.

Pakistan’s government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades. The proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after approval by the federal cabinet, rewrites the chain of command of the armed forces and places Field Marshall Asim Munir higher than any military officer before him.The bill restructures Article 243 of the Constitution and creates a powerful new post: Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). According to Dawn, the position will be held by the serving Chief of Army Staff, who will simultaneously become the constitutionally recognised head of Pakistan’s Army, Navy and Air Force. The development formalises General Munir’s elevation as Pakistan’s Field Marshal — a title that the government has already awarded but is now seeking to permanently embed into the Constitution.The changes have ignited intense debate in Islamabad, dividing political parties, lawyers and civil society. Supporters argue that the bill modernises command structures, while critics see it as a dramatic centralisation of military power that weakens civilian oversight.As per report from Dawn, the bill abolishes the position of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), the top coordinating office among Pakistan’s military services, from 27 November, when the tenure of the current CJCSC General Sahir Shamshad Mirza ends.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told Parliament that no new appointment will be made, because the Army Chief will take over the role’s functions as Chief of Defence Forces.Under the amendment, the President will appoint the Army, Naval and Air Chiefs on the Prime Minister’s advice, while the CDF will be constitutionally empowered to command all three services.A new position Commander of the National Strategic Command will oversee Pakistan’s nuclear and strategic arsenal. Dawn reported that the commander must be an officer from the Army, appointed by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the CDF. This further cements the Army Chief’s control over nuclear command authority.The bill also grants unprecedented rights to officers who attain five-star ranks such as Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force, or Admiral of the Fleet.Law minister Tarar clarified that Parliament not the Pakistan Prime Minister will have the power to cancel such titles.The amendment does not stop at the military. The second half of the proposal restructures Pakistan’s judicial system.According to Geo News, the bill establishes a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC): a powerful new judicial body that would:Legal experts quoted by Dawn warned that the changes could “dethrone” the Supreme Court as Pakistan’s top judicial authority. One senior counsel said the Supreme Court risked being turned into a “Supreme District Court”, dealing mostly with ordinary appeals, while constitutional matters shift to the FCC.Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar argued that the amendment tightens executive control over the judiciary and “empowers the FCC by disempowering the Supreme Court”.However, other senior lawyers called it a “forward-looking reform”. They say separating constitutional and appellate functions would reduce delays, depoliticise the Supreme Court and bring Pakistan closer to judicial models in other democracies.The bill has triggered fierce debate in Islamabad. The timing — months after Munir’s elevation and amid delicate coalition negotiations — has intensified public scrutiny.Dawn reported that the proposal surfaced after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari revealed that PML-N leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, requested PPP support for constitutional reforms.Government allies insist the reform merely formalises existing military structures and honours national heroes. Critics say it permanently rebalances power in favour of the Army.If adopted, the 27th Constitutional Amendment will be one of Pakistan’s most consequential defence reforms since the 1980s, dissolving one of the military’s oldest offices, raising the Army Chief to unprecedented constitutional supremacy, and reshaping Pakistan’s highest courts.","Pakistan's government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades.

Donald Trump Stuns Shehbaz Sharif With India-Pak Peace Remark After Gaza Ceasefire Summit In Egypt





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday once again thanked US President Donald Trump for resolving the India-Pakistan conflict in May.New Delhi has been consistently maintaining that India and Pakistan reached an understanding on May 10 to end the conflict after four days of intense cross-border drone and missile strikes, and no third party was involved in the process.""It was President Trump's bold and decisive leadership that brought about the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, restoring peace in South Asia, averting a major war, and saving millions of people,"" Sharif said while addressing Azerbaijan's Victory Day parade in Baku.Since May 10, when Trump announced on social media that India and Pakistan had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" after a ""long night"" of talks mediated by Washington, he has repeated his claim several times that he ""helped settle"" the tensions between the two countries.India has consistently denied any third-party intervention.Pakistan has praised Trump on multiple occasions, claiming that he brokered a ceasefire during the May conflict.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians.In his address, Sharif also mentioned Kashmir, saying that Azerbaijan's victory in Karabakh is a beacon of hope for all nations fighting against oppression.The Prime Minister said Pakistan seeks peace, but it will not allow anyone to challenge its sovereignty or undermine territorial integrity.The parade also included contingents of the armed forces from Pakistan and Turkiye who marched alongside Azerbaijani forces.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: A day after peace talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan in Turkey broke down, the Taliban on Saturday accused “elements within the Pakistani military” of pursuing “anti-Afghanistan policies for years. ”“Unfortunately, certain military elements in Pakistan appear to view a stable and strong Afghanistan as contrary to their interests,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement on X. “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts.”Mujahid also rejected claims that the rise of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was linked to the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul. “Some groups have falsely accused the Islamic Emirate, suggesting that instability in Pakistan and the TTP’s growth began with our arrival. In reality, both date back to 2002, a result of misguided policies by certain Pakistani military elements who aligned with the US, permitted drone strikes in Waziristan, and turned against their own people,” he wrote.He pointed to a series of Pakistani military campaigns against the TTP — including Operations Al-Mizan, Rah-e-Rast, Sher Dil, Nijat, Koh-e-Safid, and Zarb-e-Azb — that, he said, displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians.“In this so-called war on terror, 80,000–90,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, by Islamabad’s own count, long before the Islamic Emirate’s rise,” Mujahid added.Calling Pakistan’s instability “an internal issue,” Mujahid remarked the Taliban has taken steps to prevent cross-border militancy since taking power. These include mediating dialogue among political and religious figures, relocating refugees from the Durand Line, banning weapons among refugee populations, and issuing fatwas against unauthorized foreign jihad.“The Islamic Emirate welcomes all efforts that allow refugees to return safely,” he stated, reaffirming that Afghanistan would not allow its territory to be used to interfere in another country’s affairs.","The Taliban accused “elements within the Pakistani military’ of pursuing “anti- Afghanistan policies for years” “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125186693,imgsize-78016,width-400,resizemode-4/taliban-accuses-pakistani-military-of-fueling-instability-through-quotmanufactured-pretextsquot.jpg"

Why Pakistani critics are skeptical?







Taking ""lessons"" from tensions with India, Pakistan has moved to fortify the constitutional basis of military command, signaling a push to modernize defense structures and tighten civilian-military coherence. Its law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house, a move aimed at revising Article 243 to formally enshrine the appointments and parallel ranks of the Army, Air, and Naval chiefs.Citing “lessons” from recent India-Pakistan standoffs, Tarar said the nature of modern warfare had changed, requiring constitutional alignment with evolving command realities.“Recent Pakistan-India tensions have taught us many lessons. The nature and strategy of war have completely changed. Appointment procedures and some positions were previously in the Army Act but were not mentioned in the 1973 Constitution. Parallel ranks exist worldwide for Air Chief and Naval Chief,” Tarar said.The move, however, has come under scanner as many believe it could give more power to military than the civilian government in Pakistan.India, on May 7, launched Operation Sindoor against terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists and targeting key JeM and LeT camps. The move, which came in retaliation to Pahalgam terror attack, turned into a major India-Pakistan issue with the latter also launching a military operation against India.By May 10, the two nations announced a ceasefire after Pakistan approached India for truce talks.Ten days after the truce, Pakistani army general Asim Munir was promoted to the rank of field marshal, the principal military advisor to the prime minister and the president of Pakistan on all matters related to national security. Before Munir, former Pakistan President Genral Ayub Khan had self elevated himself to field marshal in 1959.The proposed changes to Article 243 in Pakistan's Constitution, are designed to significantly bolster the authority of the military, specifically, army chief and recently designated field marshal Asim Munir. Here's how:According to an article by Pakistani media outlet Dawn, legal experts in Pakistan remain divided on whether such institutional adjustments truly warrant a constitutional amendment, noting that most operational reforms can be achieved through ordinary legislation rather than altering Article 243.Constitutional experts argued that modernising command structures or creating a Chief of Defence Staff-type position does not require amending Article 243. Such reforms could be introduced through ordinary legislation or defence rules. Altering the Constitution, they warned, risks expanding military autonomy under the guise of structural integration.Another confusion surrounding Article 243 stems from the changes introduced by the 26th Amendment, which extended the army chief’s tenure from three to five years. The current chief, appointed under the old law and later elevated to the ceremonial rank of field marshal, a position not mentioned in the Constitution, has become the focal point of legal ambiguity.Dawn reported that experts remain divided on whether his term automatically extends under the new law or requires a fresh notification, raising questions about the real intent behind the proposed 27th Amendment: to resolve this technical uncertainty or to further cement the military’s influence within Pakistan’s constitutional framework.","Pakistan's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house.

Water shortage adds to worries – dams running dry

Pakistan’s twin cities are staring at a worsening flour emergency after the Punjab food department halted wheat supplies to mills in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, triggering panic across markets and raising questions over the country’s fragile food security. The sudden suspension has deepened an already tense economic climate, with transport blockades, water shortages and declining dam levels all feeding fears of another nationwide crisis.Dealers say all existing orders for flour, wheat and fine flour were cancelled from Friday night, leaving shops and tandoor owners without stock, PTI reported citing the The Express Tribune.The Rawalpindi Flour Mills Association, which held an emergency meeting to address the crisis, warned that “production will remain paralysed” unless wheat permits are restored immediately. The association described the ban as “ill-considered” and cautioned that shortages could spiral into a humanitarian emergency in the federal capital and adjoining regions.Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers. According to the Pakistan Naanbai Association, the price of a 79-kilogram sack of red flour has doubled to PKR 11,000 since the Shehbaz Sharif–Maryam Nawaz government took office.Fine flour, used widely for bread and bakery items, has risen from PKR 6,200 to PKR 12,600.The association’s president, Shafiq Qureshi, accused authorities of “state oppression”, claiming that dozens of tandoors have been demolished and nearly a hundred sealed for selling roti at higher prices in line with rising flour rates. Many owners have been fined between PKR 25,000 and PKR 50,000. “Instead of fixing the wheat supply, they are taking out their frustration on us,” Qureshi said, warning that families are being pushed to breaking point as bread becomes increasingly unaffordable.While wheat supply chokes Punjab’s food chain, Pakistan’s transport routes are already gridlocked due to deteriorating relations with Afghanistan. Thousands of trucks carrying food items, pharmaceuticals and export consignments for Afghanistan and Central Asia have been stranded at ports and highways.Senior Vice Chairman of the Goods Transport Association Imdad Hussain Naqvi said drivers are stuck without food, water or security. “This is not just a loss for transporters; it's a loss for the entire state,” he said, as quoted by PTI. He further warned that perishable goods are rotting on highways and thousands of workers are on the brink of starvation.The current wheat crisis comes months after India regulated flows from the Chenab following the Pahalgam terror attack. The move had contributed to a sharp drop in water levels at the country’s two key dams, Mangla and Tarbela.Pakistan is among six countries with the highest levels of inefficient agricultural water use, worsening freshwater losses amid arid conditions, according to the World Bank’s first global water monitoring report, Continental Drying: A Threat to Our Common Future.The study highlights that inefficient irrigation in drying regions—particularly in Pakistan, Algeria, Cambodia, Mexico, Thailand, Tunisia, and Romania—drives massive water waste, with more than two-thirds linked to water-intensive crops.","Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers.

‘Knew F-16s could deliver nukes’: Ex-CIA officer makes major claim on Pakistan; recalls warning of ‘enemy within’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/knew-f-16s-could-deliver-nukes-ex-cia-officer-makes-major-claim-on-pakistan-recalls-warning-of-enemy-within/articleshow/125181155.cms,"Representative image

CIA Whistleblower Confirms Pakistan’s F-16s Were Nuke-Capable, But US Hid The Truth From The World

‘Benazir was cut out of the loop’

A cover-up?





In a startling revelation, former CIA counterproliferation officer Richard Barlow has claimed that successive US Presidents continued to certify Pakistan as a non-nuclear state until 1989 — even though Washington’s own intelligence showed that US-supplied F-16 fighter jets had been modified to deliver nuclear weapons.Barlow, who tracked Pakistan’s clandestine nuclear program through the 1980s, said US officials were fully aware of Islamabad’s nuclear capabilities. “We knew that the F-16s were capable of delivering the Pakistani nuclear weapons as they existed at that time, without any doubt. It’s a hard engineering question, period. It had been looked at by the engineers and the physicists, not by me. There was that. Yet the government went ahead with the sale,” Barlow said in an interview with ANI.He added that the Reagan and Bush administrations kept certifying that Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons “all the way through 1989,” even as CIA assessments contradicted those claims. “The President continued to certify that Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons all the way through 1989. Now, I mean, I can tell you that most of us in the CIA are not comfortable with that, to say the least. But we’re not elected officials,” Barlow said.“All we can do is provide the elected officials and senior policymakers with the best available intelligence information, which is accurate, and brief them accordingly. What they do after that is not our place; we’re not in control of that.”Barlow said the US intelligence community had long concluded that Pakistan’s F-16 fleet could deliver nuclear weapons, a finding later echoed in journalist Seymour Hersh’s 1993 article in The New Yorker. “You can read all about it in Seymour Hersh’s article in The New Yorker in 1993. They saw the intelligence community saw nuclear weapons moving to air bases and being put on F-16s, et cetera. You know, so the nuclear weapons that Pakistan did not possess, according to the President of the United States, were actually being stuck on,” Barlow said.The revelations trace back to the 1987 “Brass Tacks” crisis, when Pakistani scientist Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan openly hinted at a nuclear deterrent amid heightened tensions with India. Barlow noted that the US technical experts had already verified Pakistan’s nuclear capability at that time.“To put it in a nutshell, there had been studies for years inside the intelligence community by experts, like national laboratories, etc. We knew all about the Pakistani nuclear weapons design, and we knew all about the F-16s, as you could imagine,” he said.According to Barlow, then Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had limited control over Pakistan’s nuclear program, which was effectively managed by General Mirza Aslam Beg and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan. The US, he said, only confronted Islamabad over the issue after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989.The US had kept the matter quiet during the Afghan war to secure Pakistan’s cooperation against the Soviet Union — a Cold War priority that overshadowed nuclear proliferation concerns.Additionally, talking about past India-Pakistan tensions, Barlow said that by 1990, tensions between India and Pakistan over the nuclear issue had reached alarming levels. The crisis was ultimately defused after then Defense Secretary Robert Gates was sent to New Delhi and Islamabad by President George HW Bush.He added that the 1990 standoff was “far more dangerous” than more recent India-Pakistan flare-ups due to poor command structures and limited communication. “There was a significantly greater chance of miscalculation in 1990 and miscommunication, among other issues. So I think that was a far more dangerous period,” he said.Barlow also discussed the Pressler Amendment, a 1985 US law requiring the President to certify annually that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear device to receive military aid.“After the 1990 nuclear crisis, my bosses at the agency refused to go along with any more certifications. Believe it or not, there were still people in the US government who wanted to certify under the Pressler Amendment,” he said. “They were having a collective heart attack because they knew it was over — the aid, et cetera.”Barlow also claimed that senior US State Department officials secretly tipped off Islamabad about an undercover American operation in the 1980s to arrest a retired Pakistani general involved in nuclear smuggling. The joint CIA–Customs sting had targeted Pakistani agent Arshad Parvez, who was attempting to purchase 25 metric tons of Maraging 350 steel — a key material for uranium enrichment — under the direction of Brigadier General Inam-ul-Haq. “He was supposed to show up in Pennsylvania... but Haq didn’t show up. And I learned that some people in the State Department had tipped off the Pakistani government to this arrest warrantBarlow said he was furious upon learning that officials within his own government had sabotaged the operation, describing his reaction as “ballistic.” The revelation, he said, pointed to how elements within Washington prioritized Pakistan’s cooperation in the Afghan war over enforcing non-proliferation laws. “These were people in my own government, the enemy within,” Barlow remarked, adding that such internal compromises weakened US efforts to curb Pakistan’s nuclear build-up during the 1980s.",Former CIA counterproliferation officer Richard Barlow has claimed that successive US Presidents continued to certify Pakistan as a non-nuclear state until 1989.

'No willingness to take responsibility': Afghanistan-Pakistan peace talks fail again; what next?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-willingness-to-take-responsibility-afghanistan-pakistan-peace-talks-fail-again-what-next/articleshow/125178929.cms,"Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again

Ceasefire holds despite clashes





Background of escalating tensions









NEW DELHI: The third round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan ended on Saturday without any agreement on tackling cross-border terrorism, with both sides trading blame for the collapse of negotiations.Afghanistan’s Taliban government accused Pakistan of adopting an “irresponsible and uncooperative” stance during the two-day talks held in Istanbul under the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye.“During the discussions, the Pakistani side attempted to shift all responsibility for its security to the Afghan government, while showing no willingness to take responsibility for either Afghanistan's security or its own,” Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on social media.The negotiations, aimed at addressing Pakistan’s concerns over attacks by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) from Afghan territory, failed to produce a breakthrough after Kabul refused to give a written commitment to act against the group, according to Pakistani officials.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the talks had been suspended indefinitely. “There is a complete deadlock. The negotiations have entered an indefinite phase,” Asif told a private TV channel, adding that “there is no programme for the fourth round of talks.”Asif thanked Qatar and Turkiye for their mediation efforts but said even the facilitators had lost optimism. “They support our stance. Even the Afghan delegation agreed with us; however, they were not ready to sign a written agreement. They wanted verbal assurances to be accepted, which is not possible in international negotiations,” he said.He reiterated that Pakistan would only recognise a formal, written accord. “If there is any attack from Afghan soil, we will respond accordingly. As long as there is no aggression, the ceasefire will remain intact,” Asif said.The breakdown in talks marks another setback for efforts to ease tensions between the two neighbours, who have seen repeated border clashes and escalating mistrust since early October.Mediation efforts falter amid renewed border tensionsThe breakdown came as tensions flared along the border, with both sides accusing each other of overnight shelling that left four Afghan civilians dead and several others wounded. Pakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed the stalemate, saying that “the onus lies on the Afghan Taliban to fulfil its long-standing international, regional, and bilateral pledges regarding control of terrorism, in which so far they have failed. ”“Pakistan does not harbour any ill-will against the Afghan people. However, it shall never support the Afghan Taliban regime’s any measures that are detrimental to the interests of the Afghan people as well as the neighbouring countries,” Tarar wrote on X, stressing that Islamabad will “continue to safeguard its citizens and sovereignty.”The talks were the latest in a series of mediation efforts since October, when cross-border fighting between Afghan and Pakistani forces left dozens dead on both sides. A Qatar-brokered ceasefire on October 19 has largely held, though sporadic clashes have continued.Pakistan has repeatedly accused Afghanistan’s Taliban government of harbouring TTP militants responsible for attacks inside Pakistan, a claim Kabul denies. Afghan officials, in turn, accuse Islamabad of initiating the latest round of border clashes.The Afghan side, led by intelligence chief Abdul Haq Wasiq, and Pakistan’s delegation, headed by Lt. Gen. Asim Malik, had met in Istanbul to salvage the truce, but the discussions yielded no progress.Tensions between the two neighbours have escalated since early October, following explosions in Kabul and Paktika that Afghanistan blamed on Pakistan. Both sides have since exchanged artillery fire and traded accusations of harbouring militants.In recent months, Pakistan has seen a surge in militant attacks claimed by the TTP, a group designated as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations and the United States. The TTP, though separate, is closely allied with the Afghan Taliban, with many of its leaders believed to be operating from within Afghanistan since the Taliban’s takeover in 2021.With the latest round of peace talks collapsing, both nations now face renewed uncertainty over how to prevent further cross-border violence, despite international mediation and repeated calls for restraint.",Third round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan ends without any agreement on tackling cross-border terrorism.

'A shame': Barlow on Indira Gandhi not approving joint India-Israel strike on Pakistan's nuclear facility





NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s initial motive for developing nuclear weapons — to counter India — gradually evolved into an effort to create an “Islamic bomb” aimed at aiding other Muslim nations, including Iran, according to former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer Richard Barlow.Barlow, who served as a counter-proliferation officer during the 1980s when Islamabad was covertly advancing its nuclear programme, attributed this shift in intent to Abdul Qadeer Khan, widely regarded as the father of Pakistan’s atomic weapons project.“Pakistan’s primary motive for developing nuclear weapons was to counter India. But it was also very clear from AQ Khan and the generals’ perspective that it was not just the Pakistani bomb; it was the Islamic bomb — the Muslim bomb,” Barlow told news agency ANI.“I think AQ Khan was even quoted once as saying, ‘We’ve got the Christian bomb, the Jewish bomb, and the Hindu bomb; we need a Muslim bomb.’ It was very clear to me that Pakistan intended to provide nuclear weapons technology to other Muslim countries — which is what happened,” he added.However, the phrase “Muslim bomb” did not originate with Khan but with then Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who initiated Pakistan’s nuclear programme and placed Khan at its helm.Meanwhile, Barlow also alleged that Washington’s response to Islamabad’s secret nuclear dealings was marked by “negligence.”“Not only did they (the United States) shut down from doing anything about that in 1987 and 1988, but they did nothing for the next 20 to 24 years,” he remarked.Today, only nine countries possess nuclear weapons: Russia, the United States, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea — the number of weapons in that order.While India adheres to a No First Use (NFU) policy, pledging not to use nuclear weapons unless attacked first, Pakistan imposes no such restriction on itself.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that the conflict between India and Pakistan in May, was on the verge of turning nuclear, but that his “intervention” prevented an escalation and led to a ceasefire.Barlow also claimed that a proposal by Israel to jointly bomb with India, Pakistan's Kahuta nuclear facility in the early 1980s could have ""solved a lot of problems.""The disapproval by the Indira Gandhi government was a ""shame,"" he said.""I was out of government from 1982 until 1985. And I think that may have occurred while I was out of government. I heard about it at some point. But I didn't get my teeth into it because it never happened. It's a shame that Indira Gandhi didn't approve it; it would have solved a lot of problems,"" he stated.According to reports and declassified accounts, Israel and India had planned a pre-emptive airstrike on Pakistan's Kahuta uranium enrichment plant -- the core of its nuclear programme -- to prevent Islamabad from developing and proliferating nuclear weapons, particularly to Iran, which is regarded as a ""grave adversary"" by Israel .Barlow suggested that the US administration at the time, under then-President Ronald Reagan, would have strongly opposed any such strike, particularly from Israel, as it could have disrupted America's covert war effort against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.","Former CIA counter-proliferation officer Richard Barlow says Pakistan's initial motive for developing nuclear weapons was to counter India.

Eight Jets, Not Seven, Shot Down: Donald Trump Adds Fresh Twist to His India-Pak Ceasefire Claims





NEW DELHI: Pakistan's duplicity on terrorism was laid bare once again after a minister in prime minister Shehbaz Sharif's government paid a visit to the political wing of Hafiz Saeed ’s banned Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), the outfit responsible for the 26/11 Mumbai attacks.Talal Chaudhry, minister of state for interior and a close aide of Shehbaz Sharif, visited the Faisalabad office of the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML), widely recognised as the political front of Hafiz Saeed's JuD, and held meetings with its leaders on Thursday, news agency PTI reported. The visit, described locally as an attempt to ""build political consensus,"" has sparked outrage for what appears to be official patronage of a proscribed terror-linked organisation.Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, is currently serving time in Lahore jail after multiple convictions in terror-financing cases.In a statement released after the visit, the PMML said Chaudhry and party leaders discussed ""national unity"" and ""political stability,"" underscoring the importance of ""continuity of democratic processes."" The meeting, held under the guise of promoting harmony, effectively showcased how Pakistan’s political establishment continues to normalise banned extremist outfits.This marks the first visit by a federal minister to the PMML office in recent years, further blurring the line between Pakistan's political class and its radical organisations. Earlier, Punjab assembly speaker Malik Ahmad Khan had attended a PMML rally in Kasur, where he openly praised Saeed, another indication of how terror-linked figures are courted by the ruling elite.Observers say the timing is significant. The PMML’s resurgence has coincided with renewed tensions with India, especially after the Pahalgam terror attack, with the group reportedly operating freely ""under government umbrella.""","Talal Chaudhry, minister of state for interior, visited the office of the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML) The PMML is the political wing of the banned Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), responsible for the 26/11 Mumbai attacks.

Thailand has suspended its Malaysia-brokered peace deal with Cambodia after a landmine explosion injured two Thai soldiers near the shared border, government officials confirmed on Monday.Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul announced the suspension of the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords, citing the incident as evidence that tensions remain high. The deal, overseen by U.S. President Donald Trump, was intended to normalise relations through disarmament and border demilitarisation measures.“Everything we have been doing until now will be stopped until there is more clarity,” Anutin told reporters. “What happened shows that the hostility hasn’t decreased as we thought it would. So we can’t proceed any further from here.”The suspension includes halting the release of 18 detained Cambodian soldiers, which had been scheduled to begin on November 21, government spokesperson Siripong Angkasakulkiat said.According to Bloomberg, the Thai army suspects that the landmines — which exploded during a routine patrol in Si Sa Ket province — were freshly planted, straining the ties even more between the two neighbours.The latest blast marks the seventh explosion since July, a series of blasts that led to one of the most violent border clashes.Under the peace accord, both sides had agreed to withdraw heavy weapons and clear landmines from the border area between November 1 and December 31. The explosion now threatens to derail those plans.Anutin has instructed the foreign affairs and defence ministries to file a formal complaint with the regional observer team of Southeast Asian military officials, according to a Thai government statement. He is expected to visit Si Sa Ket on Tuesday to meet the wounded soldiers and chair a meeting to reassess Thailand’s stance on the peace process.The Cambodian government has not officially commented on the latest incident but reiterated an “unwavering commitment to peace” in a statement on Monday. Phnom Penh has previously denied allegations that its forces planted landmines along the disputed border.Thailand and Cambodia have long contested stretches of their frontier, a dispute dating back more than a century.

Clinton Family, USAID And Yunus: Sheikh Hasina Aide’s Explosive Allegations On Bangladesh Coup





DHAKA: Fear has gripped Bangladesh's tiny Christian minority after three crude bomb attacks on churches and a Catholic school, which police on Sunday said caused no injuries but were ""certainly"" designed to sow terror.No group has claimed responsibility for the incidents or explained why the Christian community, which numbers around 500,000 people of the South Asian nation's 170 million citizens, was targeted.""We are trying to determine whether the incidents are connected or isolated -- they are certainly aimed at terrifying people,"" Dhaka police spokesman Muhammad Talebur Rahman told AFP.Bangladesh has been in political turmoil since a deadly uprising toppled the autocratic government of Sheikh Hasina more than a year ago.The recent attacks on Christian sites add to tensions as parties gear up for elections slated for February 2026.A churchgoer said on Sunday there was an ""eerie feeling"" within the community.""Anxiety grips many of us while going to church,"" the 25-year-old university graduate said, asking not to be named.The first attack took place on October 8, when a crude bomb was hurled at the capital's oldest church, the Holy Rosary Catholic Church, established by the Portuguese in the 17th century.Then, overnight Friday, attackers targeted two more Catholic sites -- St Mary's Cathedral and St Joseph's School and College.Nirmal Rozario, president of the Bangladesh Christian Association, said that the crude bomb exploded in front of St Mary's Cathedral, but that around 500 people came the next day to worship.Rahman said attackers targeting the cathedral zoomed up on a motorbike, and ""threw a crude bomb inside the school campus and fled"".Brother Chandan Benedict Gomes, school principal at St Jospeh's, said that the attack had caused ""anxiety"" but that ""classes were held as usual.""Interim leader Muhammad Yunus, the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner serving as chief adviser, has repeatedly promised that the first elections since the uprising will be held in February as planned, despite violent incidents.On November 5 major parties opened their campaigns, which turned violent almost immediately, with a shooting at a rally for the powerful Bangladesh National Party.Bangladesh police this month also offered cash rewards for the surrender of more than 1,300 machine guns, rifles and pistols looted during last year's uprising.",Three crude bomb attacks on churches and a Catholic school in Bangladesh.

Former Army Commander Warns of Rising Extremist Threat from Bangladesh





A former Bangladeshi minister has alleged that the 2024 riots, which led to the fall of Sheikh Hasina’s government, were backed by USAID and the Bill Clinton family. Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury, who served in Hasina’s cabinet, made the claims in an interview with Russia Today.Chowdhury said that several US-based organisations had been “running campaigns” against the Awami League government since 2018. “Certain actions of some NGOs, especially from the United States, naming a few, I mean USAID or the International Republican Institute were aimed at destabilising us,” he said.The remarks come more than a year after Hasina was forced out of power. In August 2024, student-led protests over job quotas turned violent, killing more than 700 people, according to the interim government. Hasina, who ruled Bangladesh for 15 years, fled after protestors stormed her residence. Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus was later appointed chief adviser of the interim government.Chowdhury claimed the violence was not a sudden uprising but part of a “carefully planned” operation supported by Western interests.“There is a nexus between the Clinton family and the Yunus regime from a long time ago,” he alleged. “Funding through secret NGOs was taking place to bring regime change in Bangladesh.”He also questioned the use of US aid funds. “IRI was active, USAID’s fundings were going to nowhere. Where had that money gone? It was destined for regime change activities,” he said.The 85-year-old Muhammad Yunus, a close associate of Bill and Hillary Clinton, won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for introducing microcredit—small loans aimed at helping rural families escape poverty.Sheikh Hasina, currently residing in India, had leveled accusations against the United States after her exile, alleging their involvement in her removal from power.“I resigned so that I did not have to see the procession of dead bodies. They wanted to come to power over the dead bodies of students, but I did not allow it, I resigned from the premiership. I could have remained in power if I had surrendered the sovereignty of Saint Martin Island and allowed America to hold sway over the Bay of Bengal. I beseech to the people of my land, 'Please do not be manipulated by radicals',” Hasina said in a message, the Economic Times quoted her as saying.The White House denied any involvement, saying, ""We have had no involvement at all. Any reports or rumors that the United States government was involved in these events is simply false,"" White House spokesperson Jean-Pierre had said during a press briefing when asked about the alleged US involvement.The United States has long maintained friendly relations with Bangladesh’s military and military-backed governments and reportedly sees the recent change in power as a favourable development, according to The Hill.","Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury, who served in Hasina’s cabinet, made the claims in an interview with Russia Today. In August 2024, student-led protests over job quotas turned violent, killing more than 700 people, according to the interim government. Hasina fled after protestors stormed her residence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125203816,imgsize-33540,width-400,resizemode-4/1280720-52.jpg"

Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif Threatens War Against Taliban On Eve Of Afghan Peace Talks





KABUL: The latest round of Afghanistan-Pakistan peace talks in Istanbul ended without agreement, with the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan accusing Islamabad of insincerity and attempting to shift blame onto Afghanistan.In an official clarification released by Zabihullah Mujahid on November 8, the Taliban government expressed gratitude to ""the Republic of Turkey and the State of Qatar - the two brotherly countries - for hosting and mediating the talks."" It added that Afghan representatives had attended ""in good faith and with appropriate authority"" on November 6 and 7, expecting Pakistan to approach the matter ""seriously and constructively. ""The statement said Pakistan displayed an ""irresponsible and non-cooperative attitude,"" trying to ""refer all responsibilities regarding its security to the Afghan government,"" while showing ""no willingness to assume responsibility for either Afghanistan's security or its own."" Acting on leadership instructions, the Afghan delegation had aimed for ""a fundamental solution,"" but Pakistan's actions made the talks fruitless.Criticising Islamabad's stance, the Taliban reiterated its ""principled position"" that Afghanistan will not allow its territory to be used against another country, nor permit any foreign nation to violate its sovereignty and independence. The statement emphasised that defending Afghanistan's people and territory remains ""the Islamic and national duty"" of the Emirate, vowing to ""firmly defend against any aggression with the help of Allah and the support of its people. ""While reaffirming ties with the ""Muslim people of Pakistan,"" the Taliban stated it would only cooperate ""within the limits of its responsibilities and capabilities."" The statement reflected Afghanistan's frustration at Pakistan's repeated attempts to externalise internal security issues and its reluctance to commit to regional stability.Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif admitted that the third round of talks had ""reached an uncertain stage with no results"" and said there are ""no plans yet for a fourth round."" Afghanistan's Minister for Tribes, Borders, and Tribal Affairs, Noorullah Noori, warned Pakistofficials ""not to test the patience of Afghans"" and cautioned Asif ""not to be overly confident in his country's technology,"" adding that if conflict occurs, ""both the elders and youth of Afghanistan will rise to fight. ""Zabihullah Mujahid said in a press briefing on Saturday that the issue between the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Pakistan is long-standing, dating back to 2002, and did not emerge after the Islamic Emirate assumed power.He added that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan had facilitated direct talks between the TTP and Pakistan, which were largely successful, but certain elements of the Pakistani military sabotaged the process. Mujahid also stated that some factions within the Pakistani military oppose a sovereign authority firmly established in Afghanistan.The Istanbul talks, meant to reduce border tensions, exposed Pakistan's duplicity, deepening mistrust and raising the potential for confrontation. While the ceasefire remains along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, Afghanistan suspects Pakistan may again launch unprovoked attacks, including drone strikes targeting civilians.","The latest round of Afghanistan-Pakistan peace talks in Istanbul ended without agreement.

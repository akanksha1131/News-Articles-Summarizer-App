New York ICE incident: Officer who pushed woman at immigration court reinstated,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-york-ice-incident-officer-who-pushed-woman-at-immigration-court-reinstated-report/articleshow/124223738.cms,"New York ICE incident: Officer who pushed woman at immigration court reinstated





An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who was temporarily removed from duty following a widely shared video showing him pushing a woman to the ground outside a New York immigration court has been returned to work, two US officials cited by CBS News claimed.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the reinstatement has not been publicly announced.The incident gained national attention last week after videos captured the officer confronting a visibly upset Ecuadoran woman at the 26 Federal Plaza building in Manhattan, which houses the immigration court.Footage shows the woman and her young daughter trying to cling to her husband as federal officers attempted to take him into custody.At one point, the officer, identified only as part of the ICE enforcement team, is seen pushing the woman to the floor while telling her ""adios"" several times.As per CBS News, Ruben Abelardo Ortiz-Lopez, the woman’s husband, was in the US unlawfully and entered the country in March 2024. ICE also said he had previous arrests, including for assault and obstruction of breathing.The woman involved is also facing deportation proceedings.The officer’s reinstatement comes just days after the department of homeland security condemned the conduct, calling it “unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE” and stating that he was being relieved of duties pending a full investigation, as per The Guardian.A DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, had emphasised that ICE officers are “held to the highest professional standards”, as per NPR.The case has also drawn political scrutiny. New York Rep Dan Goldman and City Comptroller Brad Lander urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to consider felony charges against the officer, citing “excessive physical force” and violations of the woman’s rights under the Constitution.Goldman called the incident an example of federal officers using “excessive violence… with impunity”.This is not the officer’s first controversial encounter. According to NPR, in September, he was allegedly observed forcibly removing a teenage girl from her father’s arms at the same court, raising concerns among court observers over repeated aggressive behaviour.","Officer who pushed woman at immigration court reinstated to work, US officials claim.

FBI Probes Dark Motive Behind Michigan Church Massacre, Leavitt Hints at Anti-Mormon Hate





Investigators in Michigan are intensively examining the life and actions of a man who killed four people and injured eight others in a church attack over the weekend, as officials work to determine his motive behind the attack and know what drove him to commit the violence.Authorities continue to classify the incident as an ""act of targeted violence,"" with the motive remaining unclear, according to Reuben Coleman, acting special agent in charge of the FBI’s Detroit field office, according to the New York Times.The suspect, identified as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford of Burton, Michigan, was killed in a gunfight with police shortly after the rampage. Sanford, a Marine Corps veteran who served from 2004 to 2008 and achieved the rank of sergeant, had attended high school locally.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was quoted as saying by Fox News that the FBI is exploring whether Sanford harboured religious animosity.“All they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith, and they are trying to understand more about this, how premeditated it was, how much planning went into it, whether he left a note”, she said.Authorities are also examining Sanford’s property, mobile phone records and speaking with his family, who have cooperated with investigators.The attack occurred Sunday morning at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints meetinghouse in Grand Blanc Township, a community of about 8,000 near Flint.Sanford drove a pickup truck into the building, brandishing two American flags, opened fire on worshippers, and set the church ablaze. Two victims were killed by gunfire, and two more were found later in the charred remains of the building.Eight others, ranging in age from 6 to 78, were hospitalised for gunshot wounds or smoke inhalation, as per Reuters.Grand Blanc Police Chief William Renye confirmed that all worshippers had been accounted for and said authorities are still investigating how the fire began, noting Sanford had likely used an accelerant such as petrol, reported BBC.Officials have interviewed more than 100 people connected to the incident as part of the probe.A separate account from a local Burton City Council candidate, Kris Johns, said Sanford had described members of the church as ""the antichrist"" during a conversation a week before the attack.Google Maps images show a Trump campaign sign at Sanford’s residence, though officials have not linked this to his actions.The Michigan shooting marks the 324th mass shooting in the US in 2025, according to the Gun Violence Archive. It comes a month after a shooting at a Catholic church in Minneapolis and coincidentally involved another 40-year-old Iraq War Marine veteran in a separate North Carolina shooting.Officials, including Governor Gretchen Whitmer, are urging the public to avoid speculation. “While it might feel natural to want to know why this attack happened, speculating is unhelpful and it can be downright dangerous,” she said, as cited by BBC.The FBI has deployed crisis response teams, bomb technicians, and more than 100 agents to assist in the ongoing investigation.Church representatives emphasised the sanctity of places of worship and called for healing. “We pray for peace and healing for all involved,” said Doug Andersen, a spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.","Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, killed in gunfight with police after shooting at Michigan church.

'It's ridiculous': Des Moines schools superintendent arrested by ICE found registered as Democrat voter in Maryland; Republican slams,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/its-ridiculous-des-moines-schools-superintendent-arrested-by-ice-found-registered-as-democrat-voter-in-maryland-republican-slams/articleshow/124223279.cms,"Read more:





Ian Andre Roberts, the superintendent of the Des Moines Public Schools in Iowa, who was arrested by ICE, is a registered active Democrat voter in the state of Maryland.According to the official website for the Maryland State Board of Elections, Roberts, who overstayed a student visa from 1999, held an active voter status and was registered as a Democrat in Maryland, Fox News reported.The development was first reported by columnist Dustin Grage. Republican state Delegate Matt Morgan, chair of the Maryland House Freedom Caucus, told Fox News Digital that Roberts’ registration meant he was eligible to vote in all federal, state and local elections despite not being a U.S. citizen and likely not having lived in Maryland for the past decade.Morgan explained that there was nothing in Maryland law allowing non-citizens to be registered to vote in federal or state elections, even if Roberts were still a legal resident.The House Freedom Caucus is now demanding answers from the Maryland State Board of Elections about ""gaping holes"" in the state’s election integrity systems.In a letter sent to the elections board on Monday, the Freedom Caucus also demanded answers on why the board had been ""obstructing a valid request by the Department of Justice to ensure compliance with federal election laws,"" citing immigration enforcement as a primary concern.Morgan referred to a letter the elections board sent to the Justice Department in August in which State Administrator of Elections Jared DeMarinis expressed concern that if the board provided voter information to the federal government, the data would be ""used for enforcement of immigration laws against Maryland residents.""Commenting on the letter, Morgan asked, ""If illegal aliens are not allowed to vote, why would they be on the voter rolls in the first place? And how would that enhance immigration enforcement? I don't know, but that's the excuse that they wrote to the DOJ."" ""It's ridiculous,"" he continued, adding that ""everyone reasonable wants a safe and secure election.""Before his arrest by ICE, Roberts headed the Des Moines Public Schools, the largest school district in the state, despite not being legally authorised to work in the U.S. after his employment authorisation card expired in 2020, according to authorities.He was taken into custody on a fugitive warrant last week. ICE agents arrested Roberts after he attempted to flee and was found hiding in brush. The vehicle Roberts was driving was found with $3,000 in cash, a fixed-blade hunting knife, and a loaded Glock 19 firearm, ICE said.Roberts also had illegal weapons possession charges from 2020 and was given a final order of removal in 2024. The state of Iowa revoked Roberts' education licence on Sunday, triggering the Des Moines School Board to place him on unpaid leave.""We were notified that the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners revoked Doctor Roberts' licence to practise as a superintendent in the state of Iowa. Without such a licence, Doctor Roberts is not in compliance with his contract,"" said Jackie Norris, chair of the school board.Morgan said that although Roberts’ case was baffling, he feared Roberts might just be the tip of the iceberg regarding illegal aliens registered to vote in Maryland. ""We have no idea how widespread this is. We hear rumours, but we have no idea,"" he said. ""This is uncharted territory,"" he added.","Ian Andre Roberts, the superintendent of the Des Moines Public Schools in Iowa, is a registered active Democrat voter in the state of Maryland.

Pharmacist Shuts Down Trump’s Dangerous MMR Vaccine Advice: ‘Puts Children at Risk’





US President Donald Trump is planning to meet with the top four congressional leaders at the White House on Monday, one day before the federal government faces a potential shutdown, a White House official and congressional sources confirmed.According to news agency AP , House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., along with house Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will be attending the meeting.The development comes after Trump abruptly cancelled a planned meeting with Democratic leaders on Thursday at the urging of Johnson and Thune, calling Democratic demands “unserious and ridiculous”.The president has faced mounting pressure as the September 30 funding deadline approaches, with Congress needing to pass a spending bill to prevent a shutdown at 12:01 am (local time) on Wednesday.“President Trump has once again agreed to a meeting in the Oval Office,” Schumer and Jeffries said in a joint statement Saturday evening.“We are resolute in our determination to avoid a government shutdown and address the Republican healthcare crisis.Time is running out”, the statement added.Democrats are demanding key health care provisions be attached to any short-term funding measure, including an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies and the reversal of cuts to Medicaid included in earlier Republican legislation, as per AP.Republicans have rejected these conditions as nonstarters, insisting on a straight seven-week extension of current funding. GOP leaders have argued that health care and other policy discussions can occur separately from the emergency spending negotiations.Johnson previously acknowledged encouraging Trump not to meet Democratic leaders until they “do the basic governing work of keeping the government open”.Tensions have escalated in recent days, with the White House Office of Management and Budget instructing federal agencies to prepare reduction-in-force plans in case of a shutdown.A senior White House official described the administration’s approach bluntly and was quoted as saying by Politico, “We’re going to extract maximum pain… Democrats will pay a huge price for this”.Officials said Trump and his allies believe Democrats will be blamed for any disruptions, while GOP members are prepared to repeatedly force votes in the Senate.Despite the posturing, Democrats maintain that the president must negotiate to secure their votes.“In what world do you ask people for their votes without sitting down and having a conversation with them,” said Shalanda Young, former OMB director under President Biden, as per Politico.Every Senate Democrat, except for Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman, voted last week against a clean, seven-week funding measure backed by Republicans.The Monday meeting will be the latest effort to find common ground before federal agencies potentially halt nonessential operations, risking mass layoffs and service disruptions across the country.",US President Donald Trump is planning to meet with the top four congressional leaders at the White House on Monday.

Rise in the Conservative movement

Following Kirk’s death

The “One Conversation at a Time” tour

Looking ahead

The 19-year-old Brilyn Hollyhand has become a central figure in the conservative youth movement following the assassination of his mentor, Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk . He is now leading his own nationwide campus tour while navigating increased security threats.Hollyhand first gained attention in 2018 when he interviewed Kirk as a fourth grader. The encounter marked the beginning of his involvement in national conservative activism. Since then, he has built a large social media following and founded The Truth Gazette, a conservative political website. He also launched a podcast that aimed to give young conservatives a platform to share their views.Hollyhand is currently a freshman at Auburn University in Alabama. He has been active in politics since a young age. His college education runs alongside his political work. Campus authorities now escort him to classes due to security concerns following Kirk’s death, as reported by the New York Post.Despite his youth, Hollyhand has already taken on significant roles in political organizations. In 2023, he was named co-chair of the Republican National Committee’s Youth Advisory Council.This position allows him to influence policies and initiatives aimed at engaging young voters.Hollyhand’s rise has been closely tied to Kirk. The young activist credits his early interviews with Kirk for giving him exposure and guidance. Over the years, Hollyhand has built a reputation as a conservative voice among young Americans. The New York Post reports that he has nearly half a million followers on social media and has participated in public events across the country.He has often emphasised work ethic and persistence in his activism. Hollyhand’s approach combines public speaking, social media outreach, and organising campus events. These methods mirror the strategies that made Kirk a prominent figure in conservative circles.Charlie Kirk was shot and killed on September 10 during Turning Point USA’s “American Comeback Tour” at Utah Valley University. Hollyhand told NY Post how he had spoken to Kirk hours before the shooting and credited him for consistent mentorship over the past eight years.After the assassination, Hollyhand’s security risks increased significantly. His threat level has reportedly tripled. He now has a personal security team. Campus authorities at Auburn University escort him to classes. Family and friends have advised him to pause public appearances. He has chosen to continue.Hollyhand has announced a 10-stop campus tour called “One Conversation at a Time.” The tour will start at the University of Arkansas. Turning Point USA is sponsoring the series. The tour aims to engage students in discussions about politics and conservative ideas.Hollyhand said he views the tour as an opportunity to carry forward Kirk’s legacy. He believes that public engagement is critical for young conservatives, especially after the death of his mentor.Brilyn Hollyhand’s career illustrates the rising influence of youth in American conservative politics. From a fourth-grade interviewer to a national youth leader, he has built a platform through persistent effort and mentorship. His activities combine digital media, campus outreach, and political leadership.Hollyhand continues to focus on his education while taking on national political responsibilities. He balances college life at Auburn University with public appearances, social media work, and leadership roles in the Republican Party.He represents a new generation of conservatives who are willing to step into leadership roles at an early age. Hollyhand’s story also reflects the growing intersection of youth activism and national politics.While his mentor’s death has raised new challenges, it has also accelerated his visibility. Hollyhand’s future activities, including the campus tour, will test his ability to navigate security risks while maintaining public influence.",Brilyn Hollyhand is a 19-year-old freshman at Auburn University in Alabama.

Arizona floods: At least four dead in torrential rains; rescue efforts underway,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/arizona-floods-at-least-four-dead-in-torrential-rains-rescue-efforts-underway/articleshow/124189941.cms,"Arizona floods: At least four dead in torrential rains; rescue efforts under way





At least four people died in central Arizona after heavy rainfall caused flash flooding, officials said Saturday, with the hardest-hit areas including the historic mining town of Globe, about 88 miles east of Phoenix.Residents were forced to climb onto rooftops as floodwaters swept through downtown streets, overturning vehicles and scattering about 1,000 propane tanks from a local distributorship, as per news agency AP According to NBC News, Carl Melford, Gila County emergency manager, confirmed three deaths in Globe.“We now have a massive search and rescue underway,” he was quoted as saying by AP, noting that authorities were investigating reports of possibly missing residents.In Scottsdale, the fourth victim was identified as 38-year-old Ander Polanco, whose vehicle had been submerged in approximately eight feet of fast-moving water on Friday evening; his body was found Saturday after the waters receded, reported NBC News.The flooding in Globe, a city of around 7,250 residents, occurred after roughly 2.5 inches (6.4 centimetres) of rain fell within 24 hours.Another storm moved in on Saturday, temporarily halting search efforts due to high-flowing creeks.Streets in the nearby mining town of Miami were also flooded, though no injuries were reported there, according to Melford.Mayor Al Gameros said the damage to downtown Globe was extensive, with buildings compromised and hazardous materials, including propane tanks, strewn across the area.“Our primary, again, is search and rescue,” he said. Officials cautioned residents to avoid floodwaters, as volunteer interference could hinder rescue dogs from locating victims.Social media videos showed vehicles being swept away, some smashed against poles, with muddy water carrying debris through the city.Mike Stapleton, Globe’s vice mayor, described reports of trapped residents, including a pregnant woman who had to swim out of a flooded restaurant, and called the devastation “just unbelievable”.Council member Freddy Rios said, “This is something that we could never even imagine, and here we are living it”.Rescue operations included teams from neighbouring counties and the state.Authorities also evacuated about 20 tourists stranded on the Havasupai Indian Reservation, including at scenic Havasu Falls.The National Weather Service reported between 1 and 2 inches of rainfall across metropolitan Phoenix on Friday, including 1.6 inches at the city airport, the highest single-day total in seven years.Hail larger than an inch was observed in some areas, and some self-driving vehicles at Phoenix airport were stuck in floodwaters.Globe city council members declared a state of emergency and urged residents to stay away from downtown until it was deemed safe.Authorities were checking vehicles among debris and assessing structural damage to ensure bridges over local creeks remained stable, as per the New York Times.With further storms expected, officials warned of continued flash flooding risks across Globe, Miami, and neighbouring communities, emphasising the importance of remaining in safe locations until conditions improved.","Floodwaters swept through downtown streets, overturning vehicles and scattering about 1,000 propane tanks from a local distributorship.

New York Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani on Sunday responded to Mayor Eric Adams’ shock decision to drop out of the race just over a month before Election Day, calling it a reflection of Adams’ ties to wealthy donors and national political figures rather than a shift in the city’s priorities.“It is very much the same race,” Mamdani told reporters. “It’s a race between us and the failed politics that we’ve seen, whether it’s Andrew Cuomo or Eric Adams… We’re going to show that they can’t dictate the outcome of this race”, he said, as per ABC 7 New York.Mamdani, who decisively defeated Cuomo in the Democratic primary, emphasised that his campaign remains focused on New Yorkers and the affordability crisis.“New Yorkers deserve leadership that is thinking about how to benefit the people of the city… too often politicians, be it Andrew Cuomo or Eric Adams, the meetings that they have or the phone calls with someone like Donald Trump , they’re only speaking about themselves”, he said, as quoted by democracynow.org.Criticising Adams’ record, Mamdani highlighted rising costs under the mayoralty. “This is a mayor who raised the rent by 12% on more than 2 million New Yorkers… and time and time again, exacerbated a cost-of-living crisis,” he claimed.Mamdani also addressed US President Donald Trump’s involvement and efforts to influence the race.“Donald Trump has spoken time and again about how he wants to narrow this race… yet we’re seeing the moment where he is shaping this race. But we’re going to show him that New Yorkers are tired of his politics and they’re tired of being priced out of the city”, he said, according to The Hill.He issued a pointed message to Cuomo, who has likely benefited from Adams’ exit. “To Andrew Cuomo. You got your wish. You wanted Trump and your billionaire friends to help you clear the field. But don’t forget, you wanted me as your opponent in the primary too, and we beat you by 13 points”.Despite Adams’ withdrawal, Mamdani insisted his campaign strategy remains unchanged. “We will have the same focus as we’ve always had, on working-class New Yorkers, their struggle to afford this city… and making sure the politics of the past do not dictate our future”.In polls, Mamdani currently leads the field with 45% support, ahead of Cuomo at 25%, Sliwa at 9%, and Adams at 8%.",New York Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani on Sunday responded to Mayor Eric Adams' shock decision to drop out of the race.

Stalemate deepens: JD Vance predicts shutdown as White House talks fail; slams Democrats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stalemate-deepens-jd-vance-predicts-shutdown-as-white-house-talks-fail-slams-democrats/articleshow/124223159.cms,"File photo: US Vice President JD Vance (Picture credit: AP)





The prospect of a federal government shutdown grew stronger on Monday after US President Donald Trump’s White House talks with top congressional leaders ended without a deal.Funding is set to expire at 12:01 am (local time) on Wednesday if no agreement is reached.As per CNBC, Vice President JD Vance predicted the worst outcome, telling reporters, “I think we’re headed to a shutdown because the Democrats won’t do the right thing”.Standing alongside House speaker Mike Johnson and Senate majority leader John Thune, Vance accused Democrats of blocking a “clean” continuing resolution to extend funding until late November.Democrats pushed back, insisting they will not accept a stopgap bill that ignores healthcare protections. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said the parties have “very large differences” but added that Trump “for the first time … heard our objections and heard why we need a bipartisan bill”, as per NBC News.House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries argued Republicans are trying to “gut the health care of everyday Americans.”The stalemate centres on whether temporary funding legislation should also extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, set to expire at year’s end.Democrats argue that without action, millions could face higher premiums when open enrolment begins on 1 November. Jeffries said, “We believe that simply accepting the Republican plan to continue to assault and gut healthcare is unacceptable”, according to news agency Reuters.Republicans counter that Democrats are holding the government “hostage.” Thune said, “What the Democrats have done here is take the federal government as a hostage — and by extension, the American people — to try and get a whole laundry list of things”, as quoted by NBC News.If no resolution is passed, federal agencies will begin furloughing staff, disrupting services from Nasa to national parks. Military personnel would also go unpaid during the closure, though all workers would be compensated once it ends, according to plans already shared by some agencies.Budget standoffs have become a recurring feature in Washington, but Trump’s threat to use the shutdown to permanently slash parts of the federal workforce has added new uncertainty.Only a few agencies have detailed their contingency plans, and Democrats say Trump’s willingness to override spending laws makes this fight riskier than previous standoffs.With the Senate scheduled to vote again on the GOP’s short-term measure on Tuesday — a bill that has already failed once — the chances of a last-minute breakthrough remain slim.Schumer said after Monday’s meeting that the gulf between the two sides remains wide, “There’s still large differences between us.”","US Vice President JD Vance predicted the worst outcome, telling reporters, “I think we’re headed to a shutdown because the Democrats won’t do the right thing” The stalemate centres on whether temporary funding legislation should also extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, set to expire at year's end.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124223167,imgsize-46062,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-14.jpg"
‘Israel is losing information war’: Charlie Kirk’s letter to Netanyahu — Details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/israel-is-losing-the-information-war-charlie-kirks-letter-to-netanyahu-details/articleshow/124223008.cms,"‘Insane Lies’: Netanyahu Hits Back Hard After Israel Dragged Into Kirk Death Conspiracy





Assassinated Conservative activist Charlie Kirk wrote a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this year, according to the New York Post.In a freshly unearthed letter, which was penned down in May, revealed that Kirk warned that Israel isn’t just fighting in Gaza—it’s flunking TikTok. With Gen Z scrolling past pro-Israel hashtags faster than a skipped ad, he frets the Jewish state is “losing the information war,” a slip that, he cautions, could cost them America’s thumbs-up.“My team and I have spent months analysing these trends and debating ideas that could help you and your country push back against these disturbing developments,” he said in the letter, reproduced in full below for the first time. “Anti-Israel sentiment can undermine American support for Israel.”“The purpose of this letter is to lay out our concerns and outline potential remedies. Everything written here is from a place of deep love for Israel and the Jewish people,” Kirk added. He has defended Israel when speaking on college campuses as part of his role leading Turning Point USA, one of the nation’s largest conservative youth organisations.“I think it’s important to be brutally honest with those you love. In my opinion, Israel is losing the information war and needs a ‘communications intervention.’” Netanyahu first referenced the letter in a September 18 video address, eight days after Kirk, 31, was shot and killed during an event at Utah Valley University.Netanyahu disputed “monstrous” falsehoods that Israel was somehow behind the killing. Right-wing pundit Candace Owens and others have asserted that Kirk was being blackmailed into publicly making firm defences of Israel while privately questioning US support for the Jewish state. Pershing Square Capital Management boss Bill Ackman later published private text messages disputing this characterization.In the letter, Kirk urged Netanyahu’s team to cease “subcontracting” rhetorical defences of Israel to American surrogates.He pointed out that, as Turning Point USA’s main voice on American college campuses, he often felt that he was “defending Israel in public” more vigorously than the Prime Minister’s office against accusations and questions, including: “I’m accused of being a paid apologist for Israel when I defend her; however, if I don’t defend Israel strongly enough, I’m accused of being anti-semitic.""“I know you’ve got a seven front war and my kvetching pales in comparison. But I’m trying to convey to you that Israel is losing support even in conservative circles. This should be a five alarm fire.”The late Turning Point USA leader listed seven suggestions for altering public opinion, including establishing a rapid response team on X and other platforms similar to that of President Trump’s White House staff; cultivating pro-Israel experts to fact-check misinformation about the Gaza conflict in real time; and creating an “Israel Truth Network” as a repository of reliable information.“When you don’t push back, anti-Semitism and anti-Israel propaganda fill the void,” he wrote. “A pro-Israel friend recently asked me, ‘Do Israelis even care how the world perceives their country?’"" Kirk also proposed sending some of the hostages released from Gaza on a speaking tour across the US as “very effective messaging.”“Also, these hostages and all your spokespersons should be arguing it’s Hamas that is committing genocide on their own people by using civilians as human shields and storing weapons in schools, hospitals etc,” he added. “That information drips out in the regular media but is almost nonexistent on social media.”Additionally, Kirk advocated for promoting social media posts about everyday life in Israel, where citizens are asked “what they love about their country."" “I’ve seen your IDF spokesman defend Israel standing at a dimly lit podium,” he continued.“This looks like a scene out of the 1970’s – like some old Walter Cronkite clips of the TV news. You need to tear down your old ways of communicating and start over from scratch.” “In my opinion, you are losing the information war which will eventually translate into less political and military support from America,” he concluded. “The Holy Land is so important to my life, and it pains me to see support for Israel slip away. ”Kirk’s alleged assassin, Tyler Robinson, 22, was apprehended the day after the activist’s murder and faces the death penalty on a charge of aggravated murder. Robinson appeared remotely during a brief court hearing on Monday morning, where his defence team requested a preliminary hearing to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to proceed to trial. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for October 30.","Conservative activist Charlie Kirk wrote a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this year.

Here's what Trump's 20-point peace plan says



Gaza will be a deradicalized terror-free zone that does not pose a threat to its neighbors. Gaza will be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough. War will immediately end if both sides agree to this proposal. Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed-upon line to prepare for a hostage release. During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal. Within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be returned. Once all hostages are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners plus 1700 Gazans who were detained after October 7th 2023, including all women and children detained in that context. For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 deceased Gazans. The plan calls for Gaza to “be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza. “Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty,” the proposal says. “Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries.” “Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip.” At a minimum, aid quantities will be consistent with what was included in the January 19, 2025. Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties. A Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energize Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts. A special economic zone will be established with preferred tariff and access rates to be negotiated with participating countries. No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return. Hamas and other factions agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form. A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people. The United States will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza. Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. As the ISF establishes control and stability, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will withdraw. In the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operation, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF to the ISF. An interfaith dialogue process will be established based on the values of tolerance and peaceful co-existence to try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis. While Gaza re-development advances and when the PA reform program is faithfully carried out, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood. The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence





President Donald Trump called it a 'historic day' after his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ended and he thanked Bibi for agreeing to the plan on Gaza. Trump announced the creation of the Board of Peace as part of his 20-point plan to bring ""eternal peace"" in the Middle East. The board will be headed by Trump and will include ""highly qualified experts,"" Palestinian representatives and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, the president said.""First time in thousands of years, I think you can probably say, if you really look into it, if you study back, if you’re a scholar, you would say thousands of years. Israel would have my full backing to finish the job of destroying the threat of Hamas. But i hope we’re going to have a deal for peace. If Hamas rejects the deal, which is always possible, they’re the only one left. Everyone else has accepted it. But I have a feeling that we’re going to have a positive answer. But if not, as you know, Bibi, you’d have our full backing to do what you would have to do,"" Trump said while sitting alongside Netanyahu at the White House.""Hamas and other terrorist factions will play no role in the board, but they’ll play no role in the governance of Gaza at all, directly or indirectly.As you know, thousands of Hamas leaders have been killed and soldiers have been killed. And we can never forget October seventh, but thousands have paid the price for that.,"" he added.The countries that played a role in peace talks between Israel and Hamas include Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, Jordan, Indonesia, Egypt and Pakistan, Trump said. If Hamas does not agree to the plan, Trump said he would back Netanyahu to ""do what he has to do"".As Netanyahu started speaking, he first thanked President Trump for the deal. He called Trump the ""greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House"" and says no one else comes close. Netanyahu said all hostages --living and dead -- should be returned within 72 hours. He said all parties are being given the chance to do this peacefully, but if Hamas rejects the plan, or they supposedly accept it then don't follow through, ""we will finish the job"", he said.""This can be done the easy way or it can be done the hard way, but it will be done,"" he said.","President Donald Trump called it a 'historic day' after his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ended.

'Trump A Threat To New York': Zohran Mamdani Challenges U.S. President On Takeover By National Guard





US President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to withhold federal funds from New York City if it voted for Democrat candidate Zohran Mamdani as mayor, setting him on a collision course with progressive American cities and states that lean Democratic and also generate more revenue.In a Monday morning Truth Social post, Trump bluntly said, “he (Mamdani) is going to have problems with Washington like no Mayor in the history of our once great City. Remember, he needs the money from me, as president, in order to fulfill all of his fake communist promises. He won’t be getting any of it, so what’s the point of voting for him?”Trump’s threat shocked Democrats, some of whom warned that if the president is going to withhold federal funds from NYC if Mamdani is elected mayor, then NYC should stop paying federal taxes.Blue states such as California and New York typically generate more tax revenue and lead in total tax collection compared to Red MAGA-voting states. They also contribute more in federal taxes than they receive back in federal funding. Demands to withhold federal contributions have also been heard in California, which is also at the receiving end of Trump’s ire.Mamdani, whose mother is the Indian filmmaker Mira Nair, is leading by double digits against his nearest rival, Independent Andrew Cuomo, in the Mayoral election set for November 4, 2025.His funky, social media-driven campaign has energised the progressive left wing of the Democratic Party whom Trump characterises as communists.Trump’s MAGA radicals are also attacking Mamdani’s part- Muslim heritage (his father Mahmood Mamdani is a Ugandan Muslim of Indian heritage, born in Mumbai), warning that he will “jihadise” NYC just as they believe Mayor Sadiq Khan has done with London. The idea of two of the world’s leading cities being led by men of Muslim faith had triggered MAGA fundamentalists who believe the UK and the US need to re-establish Christian primacy.“President Trump says it won’t matter if Mamdani is Mayor because he won’t release federal funds to Mamdani. Sadly, it’s going to be very bad for our country & the party when Mamdani is Mayor because his Islamic ideology will inspire acts of Jihad that get innocent people killed,” Trump acolyte and social media gadabout Linda Loomer, who wields enormous influence in the Trump White House, wrote on X.Loomer has also gotten after California lawmaker, Ro Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley, accusing him of sharing a stage with HAMAS supporters over the weekend at an Arab Conference, and calling him a “self hating Hindu...who acts more like a Muslim” while “real Hindus are being slaughtered by jihadists”","US President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funds from New York City if it voted for Democrat candidate Zohran Mamdani as mayor.

Amid Trump-Sharif Meeting, Political Expert Explains Why US is Eyeing Pakistan As Military Launchpad





: In an effort to worm its way back into Washington’s good books, Pakistan ’s hybrid military-civilian leadership flashed glimpses of its purported rare earths bearing mineral wealth during a meeting with US President Donald Trump last week, going by a photo released by the White House.Among a dozen photos featured in the White House picture gallery relating to the Shahbaz Sharif- Asim Munir meeting with Trump is one where the duo is showing Trump an open 18x18 inch wooden box with colorful stones presumably bearing some mineral deposits. Two of the larger rocks appear to be bastanzite and monazite clumps that typically bear rare earths elements (REE) such as cerium, lanthanum, and neodymium. Some of the smaller candy-colored pebbles look like gemstones.Pakistan has long spoken of its vast untapped oil, gas, and mineral ores, some bearing rare earths, mostly in the troubled Balochistan region wracked with insurgency, and also in Khyber-Pakhtoonwa. While none of the mineral deposits are commercially proven or quantified, Pakistan’s leadership showcased the baubles to the US President to highlight collaboration and exploration bids it has signed with a private US firm earlier this month.The charm offensive also included PM Sharif wearing a lapel pin the had both the US and Pakistani flags, a gesture some Pakistani trolls on social media termed as “embarrassing.”While there is no direct government-to-government agreement to explore or exploit the mineral wealth, Pakistan's Frontier Works Organization (FWO)—a military-linked engineering and mining entity—signed an MoU on September 8 with the Missouri-based US Strategic Metals (USSM), a private US firm specializing in critical minerals.The agreement, with an initial funding of $ 500 million from USSM, envisages three phases: Phase 1 (Immediate, 2025–2026) involving export of readily available minerals (e.g., antimony and copper concentrates) to US markets, generating quick revenue. Phase 2 (Medium-term, 2026–2028) involving construction of processing plants and refineries in Pakistan, with technology transfer for REE separation and purification. Phase 3 (Long-term, 2028+), involving large-scale exploration and exploitation, including drilling in high-potential REE belts; and developing 5–10 mining projects.Islamabad's rare earths gambit with the US — which could cause Pakistan's patron China to burst a blood vessel since it has a stranglehold on rare earths supply to the US — comes on the heels of the its crypto caper, where it used a British-Pakistani entrepreneur to position itself as crypto capital where American businesses with ties to the Trump family could make a fortune.","Pakistan has long spoken of its vast untapped oil, gas, and mineral ores, some bearing rare earths.

I think you've called it a hybrid model - where the military and civilian leaders effectively share power. But the military leaders are really the ones in charge, are they not? In most countries, the head of the army answers to the defence minister. In your country you, the defence minister, answer to the head of the army, don't you? Asim Munir is a more powerful person than you are. "" Khawaja Asif rejected the statements. and said: ""No, it's not like that... I'm a political appointee.""When confronted with the example of how in the US, Pete Hegseth, the secretary of war, has the power to fire American generals, but the same cannot be said for Pakistan, Asif sourly retorted, saying, ""They (US) have a different model over here.It's called deep state.""On Hasan further saying, ""In your country (Pakistan) the deep state's in charge. That's what the accusation is"", Asif put the blame on past leadership, stating, ""You can say that because of our military rulers - it is more visible...""On being further probed as to where the power lies in Pakistan, the defence minister explained it as ""hybrid"".Earlier this year, Asif had told Arab News about the 'hybrid regime' that currently runs the country, Dawn reported. The term, Dawn said, is used to describe the informal power-sharing arrangement, whereby the military holds a significant influence on the civilian leadership. ani","Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif defended the country's 'hybrid model' of governance.

Seventeen militants linked to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Saturday were killed in a joint operation by Pakistan’s Frontier Corps (FC) and police in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, officials told news agency AP.According to District Police Officer (DPO) Karak Shahbaz Elahi, the intelligence-led operation took place in the Karak district on Friday following credible reports about the presence of militants affiliated with the TTP and the Mullah Nazir group.As security forces approached, the militants opened fire, prompting retaliation in which all 17 were killed. A substantial cache of arms and ammunition was recovered from the scene. Three security personnel sustained injuries in the firefight.The slain militants were reportedly wanted for multiple crimes, including attacks on security forces, kidnapping for ransom, and other terrorist activities. A curfew was later imposed in Darsha Khel and surrounding villages to facilitate a wider combing operation, as several militants were believed to have fled the area.Separately, at least 23 civilians, including women and children, were reportedly killed in an airstrike in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Monday.","Seventeen militants linked to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed in a joint operation by Pakistan’s Frontier Corps (FC) and police in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Awkward contradictions on Imran Khan







Pakistan's defence minister, Khawaja Asif , has once again defended his country's ""hybrid model"" of governance, insisting that the military and civilian leadership work ""by consensus"" in managing state affairs.Speaking to British-American journalist Mehdi Hasan, Asif dismissed suggestions that the army dominates Pakistan's politics, while controversially describing US democracy as a ""deep state.""When asked whether Pakistan's generals hold more power than elected ministers, Asif retorted, ""No, it's not like that. I'm a political appointee, I’m a political worker."" Pressed further with comparisons to the United States, where civilian leaders have the authority to dismiss top generals, he claimed, ""They (the US) have a different model over here. It's called deep state.""Hasan pointed out that in Pakistan, critics accuse the military of being the real decision-maker. Asif acknowledged the perception, blaming ""past military rulers"" for the image, but insisted the system was based on consensus. Asked directly who prevails if he and Army chief Asim Munir disagree, Asif said: ""It's not equal. We can agree to disagree. It is by consensus, whatever is taking place.""Earlier this year, Asif had described the hybrid arrangement as a ""practical necessity,"" saying that while not an ideal form of democracy, it was helping Pakistan manage its economic and governance crises. Local daily Dawn has reported that Asif often praises the military-civilian partnership, despite critics branding it undemocratic.Turning to geopolitics, Asif insisted Pakistan's tilt toward Washington under US President Donald Trump, with new mineral and crypto trade deals, would not jeopardise Islamabad's ties with Beijing. ""We are not worried about that, because it's a time-tested relationship with China since the late 50s. China is not worried about our flirtations or whatever you call it,"" he remarked.Highlighting defence ties, he said: ""In the past, even today and in the future also, China has been a very reliable ally. Our Air Force, submarines, planes — almost a major portion of our arms are from China, and our defence cooperation is increasing. It is much more robust than before, with China, the main reason is unreliability of other sources like the United States.""He underscored geography as another factor: ""They (China) are reliable and they are our neighbours. We share borders and we share the geography.""The interview also turned uncomfortable when Asif was confronted about his shifting claims on jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan's social media activity. At one point, he alleged Khan was operating his account from Adiala Jail. When reminded that he had earlier accused India of controlling Khan's account, Asif appeared flustered.""You just made two different allegations. Is it Imran in his prison cell or is it India?"" Hasan asked. Asif responded, ""Either he is operating from the cell or he should at least identify who is operating the jail cell.""Pressed further on evidence, Asif cited ""intelligence sources"" but refused to provide details, insisting: ""The evidence I cannot publicly disclose… but it is there.""","Pakistan's defence minister defends country's ""hybrid model"" of governance.

Nepal PM Oli ‘Planning To Flee To Dubai’, Gen Z Bring ‘Corrupt’ Govt To Its Knees | Watch





Nepal's former Prime Minister and CPN-UML chairman KP Sharma Oli has publicly dismissed speculation that he plans to leave the country, accusing the Sushila Karki-led government of attempting to strip him of his security and official entitlements amid ongoing political tension, reported news agency ANI.Addressing a gathering of Yuwa Sangh Nepal, the youth wing of his party, in Gundu, Bhaktapur, Oli declared, ""Do you think we will flee by handing over the nation to this groundless government?"" He said he remained committed to restoring “peace, good governance and constitutional order”, as quoted by the agency.Oli’s remarks come weeks after the fall of his government on September 9, which followed large-scale Gen Z-led protests. Since vacating the Prime Minister’s official residence in Baluwatar, Oli has relocated to a rented house in Gundu, following an arson attack on his private residence in Balkot by protestors.The CPN-UML chief alleged that the current administration lacked democratic legitimacy and was formed through “vandalism and arson”, not the people’s mandate.Challenging the government to disclose any communication he had with state authorities during the protests, Oli said, “Publish them with courage.Make public the instructions I gave.” He denied any wrongdoing and questioned the basis of efforts to link him to the violent unrest.He also raised concerns over reported threats to his safety and criticised the government for inaction. “On social media, there are open calls to attack my residence. What is the government doing? Just watching?” he asked.The former PM expressed strong objection to reports that the government was planning to withhold passports of several political leaders, including himself, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Arzu Rana Deuba, Ramesh Lekhak, and Deepak Khadka.Oli accused the ruling dispensation of creating a climate of insecurity and targeting opposition leaders. “This government is throwing the country into insecurity,” he alleged.Meanwhile, a recent monitoring report by Nepal’s national human rights commission (NHRC) blamed the previous government, led by Oli and then-home minister Ramesh Lekhak, for failing to anticipate the scale of the Gen Z protests. The NHRC said that while the initial demonstrations on September 8 were peaceful, the use of excessive force by security personnel on September 9 led to dozens of deaths and widespread violence.Rights groups have held Oli and Lekhak accountable for the crackdown, which played a key role in the fall of their administration. The NHRC report highlighted poor coordination, declining morale among security forces, and inadequate preparation as contributing factors to the high casualties.","KP Sharma Oli accuses Sushila Karki-led government of attempting to strip him of his security and official entitlements.

Poll Is imposing curfews an effective way to manage civil unrest? Yes, it helps restore order. No, it only escalates tensions.





At least three people were killed and dozens injured on Sunday as clashes erupted between aboriginal tribesmen and the Bengali settler community in southeastern Bangladesh, following the alleged gang rape of a tribal girl.The unrest first began in Khagrachhari district headquarters, where tribal groups, mainly from the Chakma and Marma communities, enforced a roadblock with burning tyres, tree trunks, and bricks on Saturday.Authorities responded by restricting movement and rallies, but the violence later spread to the Guimara area, 36 kilometres south of the district headquarters.“Three people were killed in gunshots at Guimara. Their bodies have been kept at Khagrachhari Sadar Hospital,” said police deputy inspector general Ahsan Habib, as quoted by PTI.“The authorities have enforced Section 144, but a curfew-like situation prevails at Khagrachhari town as people preferred to stay indoors fearing outbreak of escalating violence,” senior journalist Jiten Barua told PTI.The clashes followed the alleged gang rape of an eighth-grade schoolgirl on Tuesday. The girl was reportedly found by her parents and neighbours around midnight in an unconscious state after returning from private tuition.She received treatment at a local hospital. Police later arrested a Bengali teenager suspected to be involved and placed him under six-day remand for questioning.The violence also injured 13 army personnel and three policemen, according to the home ministry in Dhaka.The home ministry issued a statement on Sunday evening expressing regret over the casualties, pledging legal action against those responsible, and urging residents to remain calm.“The ministry of home affairs has expressed deep sorrow over the incident in which three hill people were killed and 13 army personnel, including a major, three policemen, including the OC of Guimara Police Station and many others were injured in an attack by miscreants in Guimara Upazila of Khagrachhari district,” said the statement.",Clashes erupted between aboriginal tribesmen and the Bengali settler community in southeastern Bangladesh.

India Dragged Into Bangladesh Politics: Muhammad Yunus Accuses New Delhi of Spreading Propaganda





DHAKA: Bangladesh's student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) threatens to halt elections after the Election Commission (EC) refused to allocate the symbol it demanded ahead of the February polls.NCP, a large offshoot of Students against Discrimination (SAD), which led last year's street campaign dubbed as the July Uprising, toppling then prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League and installing professor Muhammad Yunus as the chief adviser.""The commission could not show any legal logic for not allocating the 'shapla' (water lily) as our symbol and therefore we are sticking to our demand,"" NCP's convenor Nahid Islam was quoted as saying on Wednesday by newspapers a day after the EC revealed its decision on the issue.Islam said NCP would give its ""final reaction"" once the EC takes its ""formal decision"".However, the party's chief coordinator for northern Bangladesh, Sarjis Alam, threatened to halt the polls unless their demand was met.""Since there is no legal barrier, the NCP must get the 'shapla' as its symbol; there is no other option. Unless we get it, we will see how the election is held and how someone could dream of attaining power,"" Alam posted on social media.EC's senior secretary, Akhter Ahmed, on Tuesday told a media briefing that NCP would not be allotted the symbol they demanded as it is ""not included in the list of electoral symbols as per the regulations"".""The 'shapla' is not on our list of 115 electoral symbols. According to the rules, political parties must choose a symbol from the approved list,"" he said.The ""shapla"" is the national emblem of Bangladesh.NCP chief coordinator Nasiruddin Patwary led the party delegation to the EC to get its registration earlier and said the party must be registered with the ""shapla"" symbol.Asked how they would secure the symbol since it was not included in the EC's revised list, he said amendments could be made at any time.Patwary also said the party expected to win around 150 constituencies out of 300, with nominations including former army officers, as well as women, farmers, and workers involved in the July uprising.Several political analysts, however, speculate a bleak fate for NCP in elections, particularly after their nominees witnessed a landslide defeat in students' union elections in two major public universities - the premier Dhaka University and suburban Jahangirnagar University.Bangladesh's largest Islamist Party, Jamaat-e-Islami-backed Islami Chhaita Shibir, won in most of the posts in both elections. Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, the student wing of former prime minister Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party, also witnessed an astounding defeat, though it emerged as the second biggest student group in the central students union polls in the two universities.",Bangladesh's student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) threatens to halt elections.

Yunus discusses SAARC revival with US envoy Gor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/yunus-discusses-saarc-revival-with-us-ambassador-designate-to-india-sergio-gor/articleshow/124078736.cms,"File photos





While it’s well known that Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived, he has now raised the issue with Sergio Gor, the US ambassador-designate to India who will also play the role of Special Envoy for South and Central Asia.Yunus met Gor on the margins of the ongoing UNGA session in New York. According to Dhaka, the chief advisor noted that the interim government has intensified efforts to revive SAARC, which has not held a summit in over a decade.SAARC summits are held biennially but the process has remained stalled since the summit in Kathmandu in 2014. The Uri terrorist attack in 2016 put paid to the summit that Pakistan was scheduled to host that year and India has since maintained Pakistan’s continued support for cross-border terrorism has made unfeasible the SAARC dialogue, including summits and important meetings.However, India has continued to support SAARC activities in diverse sectors for closer cooperation and blamed Pakistan for blocking trade and connectivity initiatives in the region. While it hasn’t withdrawn from the Association, India has sought to strengthen regional cooperation through the BIMSTEC grouping in which Pakistan is not a member.The US readout said regional cooperation was discussed but didn’t specifically mention SAARC.Bangladesh didn’t say what Gor’s response was to Yunus’ remarks on SAARC but India will be wary of any external pressure to resume the summit process. The idea of Pakistan hosting even a virtual summit has been rendered a non-starter because of the Pahalgam terrorist attack that led to a dramatic military clash between India and Pakistan.India sees the appointment of Gor as ambassador by the Trump administration as a welcome development but will guard against any US attempt to intrude into South Asian affairs through Gor’s dual role, particularly if it has any security fallout for the region. India is already worried about security challenges that Dhaka’s warming ties with Pakistan might entail. It has shown little interest so far in Yunus’ efforts to, as he said earlier, revive the spirit of SAARC.While countries like Bangladesh and Nepal seek a resumption of the summit process, India maintains that there has been no material change in the situation since the 19th summit that Pakistan had to host was postponed and that there’s no consensus among members on the meeting.India closely followed a China-Pakistan-Bangladesh trilateral meeting at Kunming, taking note of reports that this was an effort to create a new bloc in the region, However, Dhaka later denied this was an effort to forge an alliance against any country.Yunus also discussed with Gor the Rohingya crisis, and the “proliferation of disinformation targeting Dhaka”. Yunus has in the past described as fake news some of the reports in Indian media about targeting of Hindus in Bangladesh .According to Dhaka, Yunus also expressed Bangladesh’s interest in joining ASEAN, stating that integration with Southeast Asian economies could significantly accelerate the country’s development. He told Gor Dhaka ismaking “comprehensive preparations” to ensure a free, fair, and peaceful general election in the first half of February.","Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived.

As the first light of Mahalaya dawns, Chelmsford, UK, gears up for its annual Durga Puja , brought to life by Sankalpo — a community organisation founded in 2020 with a pledge to celebrate Indian culture in Essex.Kicking off with a grand ‘Food Mela and Bazaar’ on Mahalaya, this year over 1,200 attendees are expected to converge at various events from Oct 3 to 5, creating a lively tapestry of cultural exchange, community spirit and well-being.“What sets our Durga Puja apart is its unwavering spirit of inclusivity. Every year, we champion a powerful cause that is current and meaningful, making our Puja a celebration with both heart and purpose,” said Arita Barua, a healthcare worker.A standout highlight this year is the innovative fashion show called “Sindoor: Threads of Resistance”, inspired by Operation Sindoor , where glamour meets purpose. Women will grace the runway in traditional Indian attire, radiant in every conceivable shade of red, embodying a new kind of bride --- one who is strong, resilient and unbowed by adversity.By their side, men will wear striking ensembles in bold black and pure white, symbolising grooms of dignity and men of honour.Together, these contrasting colours will weave a narrative of unwavering strength, solidarity and a united stand against evil be it violence, bloodshed or tyranny.In the ‘Food Mela and Bazaar’, Sankalpo aimed to spotlight local businesses and foster cross-cultural understanding. Visitors indulged in authentic Indian cuisine, shop for handcrafted goods, and engage with vendors representing diverse backgrounds, all under one roof.The three-day celebration will also feature a dedicated health and well-being hub. Attendees can avail themselves of free health checkups.“In the heart of Chelmsford, we don't just celebrate Durga Puja; we rebuild a piece of Kolkata. The familiar ache of nostalgia for our childhoods spent pandal-hopping and feasting on the streets of Bengal melts away as we see our own children find their roots in the rhythm of the dhak and the warmth of a shared bhog,” said Meghdut 'Bobby' Biswas, an entrepreneur and a core member of Sankalpo.","Chelmsford, UK, gears up for its annual Durga Puja.

Contribute or leave: UK to tighten migrant rules; what we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/contribute-or-leave-uk-to-tighten-migrant-rules-what-we-know/articleshow/124211177.cms,"



Labour’s conference focus

Migration and Channel crossings





Britain’s interior minister, Shabana Mahmood, proposed tough new rules on Monday for migrants seeking to settle permanently in the UK, as the ruling Labour party sought to strengthen its position against the rising popularity of the hard-right, anti-immigrant Reform UK party at its annual conference in Liverpool.Under the plans, migrants looking to obtain indefinite leave to remain (ILR) would be required to have a job, refrain from claiming benefits, contribute to social security, maintain a clean criminal record, volunteer in their communities, and demonstrate proficiency in English. The government plans to consult on the changes later this year.Currently, migrants with British family members who have lived in the UK for five years—or those legally residing on any visa for ten years—qualify for ILR, which grants permanent residence, the right to work, study, access benefits, and apply for citizenship.The new rules mark a major policy shift. Mahmood would have emphasized that ILR must “be earned,"" as reported by AFP.Meanwhile, a government source, quoted by Telegraph UK said: “Some, based on their contribution or skills, could earn earlier settlement. Others, who have made a lesser contribution, will only earn leave to remain later, or not at all.” Mahmood added: “I am looking at how to make sure that settlement in our country – long-term settlement, indefinite leave to remain – is linked not just to the job you are doing, the salary you get, the taxes you pay, [but] also the wider contribution you are making to our communities.The announcement comes in direct response to Reform UK leader Nigel Farage’s plan, which would abolish ILR and require migrants to reapply for visas every five years, affecting hundreds of thousands of non-EU citizens already holding permanent residency. Labour described Farage’s proposal as a threat to workers who have contributed to the country for decades.Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned Reform’s proposal on Sunday, calling it “racist” and “immoral,” warning it would “tear the country apart” by targeting migrants lawfully working in hospitals, schools, or running businesses. “It is one thing to say we’re going to remove illegal migrants… I’m up for that. It is a completely different thing to say we are going to reach in to people who are lawfully here and start removing them. They are our neighbours,” he had said.Mahmood, delivering her first speech as interior minister, will stress the need for migrants to learn English to a high standard and pledge to be a “tough” minister. She warned that failing to address irregular migration risks pushing working people toward the “false promises” of Farage.Finance Minister Rachel Reeves, speaking at the conference, highlighted economic resilience and youth employment, noting that young people who refuse a job after 18 months on benefits could lose state support. Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper stressed that the next general election, due in 2029, will present voters with a choice between Labour and a “chaotic right-wing ideology.”More than 100 organisations have urged Mahmood to “end the scapegoating of migrants and performative policies that only cause harm.” UK and French authorities continue to struggle to manage migrants crossing the Channel by small boats, with 32,000 arrivals so far this year. Some 895 people reached the UK on Saturday alone, including a record 125 crammed onto a single vessel. At least 27 deaths have been reported from illegal crossings since the start of the year.Labour officials framed the new ILR measures as a way to clearly differentiate their policies from those of Reform UK while addressing voter concerns over immigration and social cohesion."," interior minister Shabana Mahmood proposes tough new rules for migrants seeking to settle permanently in the UK.

UK to mandate digital IDs for workers to curb illegal migration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-to-mandate-digital-ids-for-workers-to-curb-illegal-migration/articleshow/124169674.cms,"(This is a Reuters story)





LONDON: Britain on Friday said it would introduce a mandatory digital ID scheme for British citizens and residents starting a new job as a measure to deter illegal immigration.""It will make it tougher to work illegally, making our borders more secure,"" PM Keir Starmer said in a statement announcing the move, which had been previously reported. Polling shows immigration is top of voters' concerns in Britain, with Starmer under intense pressure to stop migrants entering the country illegally. The plans, which govt had previously said it was considering, drew criticism from opponents who say it would not deter migrants and could infringe on civil liberties.""It's laughable that those already breaking immigration law will suddenly comply, or digital IDs will have any impact on illegal work, which thrives on cash-in-hand payments,"" said a spokesperson for Nigel Farage's Reform UK Party, which leads opinion polls ahead of an election not due until 2029. Govt said the ID would be held on people's mobile phones and would become a mandatory part of checks that employers already have to make when hiring a worker by end of current parliament in 2029. It would, in time, also be used to provide access to other services.","Britain to introduce a mandatory digital ID scheme for British citizens and residents starting a new job.

'I Don't Agree With Him': Trump Opposes Starmer's Push For Palestinian Statehood

What is the digital ID plan?



Who will be eligible?



How will the application process work?



Why is the digital ID being introduced now?



Opposition and public reaction



Current identification methods



What’s next?







UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital ID system for all nationals and residents, aiming to curb illegal immigration and simplify access to government services, according to an official statement. .The government said the new digital ID, which will be stored on users’ smartphones, will streamline applications for services such as driving licences, childcare, welfare, and tax records. While individuals will not be required to carry or present the ID routinely, it will be “mandatory as a means of proving your right to work,” the statement added.Starmer explained the move will help prevent those without legal status from securing employment, thereby cutting off a key incentive for illegal migration. “This will stop those with no right to be here from being able to find work, curbing their prospect of earning money, one of the key 'pull factors' for people who come to the UK illegally,” the government said.Here is what you need to know about the government’s digital ID initiative:The new digital ID will be an app or digital credential stored on individuals’ smartphones. It will serve as a secure, government-backed proof of identity to access a range of services - from applying for driving licences and childcare benefits to accessing welfare and tax records.While the ID will not be compulsory to carry or show routinely, it will be mandatory to prove the right to work in the UK. This aims to prevent employers from hiring workers who lack legal permission to work, thereby reducing illegal employment.Starmer described the digital ID as an “enormous opportunity for the UK” and said it will provide “countless benefits” to ordinary citizens while helping the government enforce immigration laws more effectively.The digital ID will be available to all UK nationals and legal residents, including foreign nationals living in the country. The government emphasised inclusivity, pledging that the system will accommodate those without smartphones, such as the elderly or homeless.Details on the application process will be shaped by a forthcoming public consultation planned for later this year. The government has promised to engage with groups who might face challenges using digital services, ensuring the system is user-friendly and accessible to all.The UK has traditionally resisted introducing national ID cards, with the Conservative government scrapping a previous voluntary identity card system in 2011 established under Tony Blair’s administration. However, the current government views digital ID as a modern solution to immigration and public service access challenges.Illegal immigration remains a politically sensitive issue, and Starmer faces pressure from within his own Labour Party to address it effectively ahead of the party’s annual conference.Opposition voices have been critical. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said on social media that her party would “oppose any push… to impose mandatory ID cards on law-abiding citizens,” stressing that British people should not be forced into such a system.The Liberal Democrats also rejected the plan, arguing they ""cannot support a mandatory digital ID where people are forced to turn over their private data just to go about their daily lives.""Nigel Farage, leader of the hard-right Reform UK party - which polls predict could play a key role in the next government - voiced strong opposition, saying, ""I do not see a single benefit to the government having digital ID other than them controlling what we do, what we spend and where we go.""At present, UK citizens rely on passports, driving licences, and utility bills as forms of identification, depending on the situation. The digital ID aims to unify these disparate proofs into a single, streamlined digital identity.The government will soon launch a public consultation to gather feedback on the digital ID service, including from digitally excluded groups. Officials highlighted that lessons will be drawn from other countries with similar systems to ensure accessibility and privacy protections.(With inputs from agencies)","UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital ID system for all nationals and residents.

TOI Correspondent from London:





The man arrested in the Oldbury “racially motivated” rape of a young British Sikh woman has been released on police bail without charge, sparking huge anger in the Sikh community Crimestoppers, which is independent of the police, is offering a £20,000 (approx. Rs 24 lakh) reward for information they receive that leads to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the rape.The attack and rape by two white men happened on a woman in her 20s in the Tame Road area of Oldbury on Sept 9 just before 8.30 am as she was walking to work. Police initially said they were treating it as “racially aggravated”.Police had arrested a man in his 30s on suspicion of rape on Sept 14 but have so far failed to track down the second man.The Sikh community has in response put out its own appeal and put up a reward of £10,000 (about Rs 12 lakh) for information leading to the arrest and successful conviction of the two men involved.Sikh Federation UK has spearheaded a letter writing campaign calling on Sikh constituents to write to their MPs requesting them to make a public statement about the rape and to request the prime minister to treat anti-Sikh hate on a par with Islamophobia.They also claim police initially downplayed the rape.West Midlands police and Sandwell Council have put a mobile CCTV camera near the scene for reassurance. Hundreds of hours of CCTV footage have been examined and forensic specialists are also carrying out extensive enquires.Chief superintendent Kim Madill of Sandwell Police said: “In the last two weeks, our officers have been working flat out as part of this investigation. Our neighbourhood officers have been patrolling the area and we have specialist officers who have been supporting the victim and her family.”",The attack and rape by two white men happened on a woman in her 20s in the Tame Road area of Oldbury on Sept 9.

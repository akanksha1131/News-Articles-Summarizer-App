Piers Morgan slams Candace Owens and Bassem Youssef over Erika Kirk remarks







The online fight around Charlie Kirk took a sharp turn after Piers Morgan publicly called out comments made on Candace Owens’ podcast. Morgan said it was wrong to joke about Erika Kirk. The backlash started after Bassem Youssef appeared on Owens’ show on January 29. During their talk, they discussed a leaked Zoom call involving Erika Kirk and Turning Point USA staff. Candace Owens questioned Erika Kirk’s behavior during that call, focusing on her facial expressions and tone.Soon after, a short clip from the podcast went viral. In that clip, Youssef made a remark that many viewers felt crossed a line. Piers Morgan reacted strongly, saying humor should never target a woman already facing public pressure. His comments added fuel to an already heated debate that had moved far beyond facts and into speculation.After the clip spread on X, Piers Morgan responded directly to Youssef. He wrote, “Why do you find it so funny to mock a young widow who has been dragged into public attacks? It is disgusting.” Morgan has repeatedly said that claims about Charlie Kirk are not supported by verified evidence.Youssef fired back at Morgan online. He questioned the credibility of official explanations and accused public figures of pretending to care while ignoring what he called unanswered questions.In his reply, Youssef criticized how grief is judged in public and suggested people do not trust investigations, though he provided no new proof.Earlier on the podcast, Youssef also mocked how Erika Kirk’s grief was discussed online, making comments that many listeners felt were cruel rather than funny. Candace Owens did not directly push back during that moment. Instead, the conversation moved to other topics, including Israel and media power.Piers Morgan has challenged Candace Owens on similar claims before on Piers Morgan Uncensored. He has praised her debating skills but said he believes she promotes unverified theories for attention and money. In January, Morgan also hosted Jeremy Boreing, who criticized Owens for targeting former allies and chasing clicks.In December, Morgan invited Owens back on his show and made a clear offer. If her claims were proven true, he would publicly praise her work. If not, he said she should openly admit she was wrong. That challenge still stands, as no verified evidence has backed the claims discussed on her podcast.",Piers Morgan publicly called out comments made on Candace Owens' podcast.

A former nurse has pleaded guilty to fraud and drug possession after admitting to defrauding a Quebec medical clinic of more than $55,000 to obtain opioid medications.Lovedip Sandhu, a 35-year-old Canadian national and resident of Pierrefonds, entered her guilty plea in mid-January to charges of fraud over $5,000 and simple possession of narcotics. The offences stem from her work at a private plastic surgery clinic in Montreal in 2021, reports French-Canadian newspaper La Presse.Sandhu was employed at Clinique K, a plastic surgery clinic in Westmount, where she worked as a nursing assistant. Her duties included preparing patients for surgery, organising medication orders, and dealing with pharmaceutical companies on behalf of the clinic.Between March and September 2021, prosecutors say Sandhu carried out 75 fraudulent transactions without her employer’s knowledge. She forged the signature of the clinic’s owner, Dr Karl Schwarz, to place orders for opiates. She later collected the drugs from pharmacies and paid for them using the clinic’s credit cards.Through the scheme, Sandhu obtained 3,778 one-millilitre vials of sufentanil and 2,138 one-millilitre vials of hydromorphone.At the time of the offences, Sandhu was a registered member of the Quebec Order of Nurses and Nursing Assistants.She is no longer part of the professional body, having been expelled in 2022.Following her arrest in September 2021, Sandhu told police she had developed an addiction earlier that year due to health issues. She admitted initially taking medication from the clinic’s supply before her use increased.Police searches uncovered empty syringes and vials, several boxes of medication, and $11,000 in cash at her homes. Sentencing submissions in the case have been postponed until June.","Lovedip Sandhu, a 35-year-old Canadian national, entered her guilty plea in mid- January to charges of fraud over $5,000 and simple possession of narcotics.

As a 24-hour wave of synchronised violence swept through Balochistan over the weekend, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) released the photos of two women fidayeens — Asifa Mengal (23) and Hawa Baloch (24) — who carried out the attacks on symbols of Pakistan’s authority in the restive province.The two women swapped their regular lives to join the BLA’s Majeed Brigade, their fidayeen squad and blew themselves up at different locations during the offensive Herof 2.0 that saw BLA rebels attacking govt offices, banks and Frontier corps HQ and other military installations across Kalat, Gwadar, Mastung, Noshki, Kharan, Turbat, and Pasni areas. The BLA’s media wing, Hakkal, also released the footage of the attacks and hostages on social media.According to BLA, Asifa, born in 2002 in Noshki, diverged from a conventional life, eventually taking part in a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) attack against the ISI headquarters in her hometown on Jan 31, 2026. The BLA said that it was on her 21st birthday in 2023 that Asifa joined their Majeed Brigade. Her path was mirrored by Hawa Baloch, an aspiring writer from the Kech district. For Hawa, the conflict was personal; she followed the trajectory of her father, Nabi Baksh Baloch, also a BLA member, who was killed in Sistan, Iran in 2021.She had joined the Majeed Brigade after her father’s killing.The wave of attacks saw around a dozen participants ranging from 60-year-old Hatam Naz Sumalani to 70-year-old Nako Fazal Baloch who blew themselves up at different locations during the violence. But by trading classrooms and social media feeds for the frontlines, Mengal and Baloch have signalled a deepening crisis within the province.Both BLA and Pak govt have claimed to have inflicted heavy casualties with the BLA’s claim pegging the Pak personnel deaths to over 100. Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti said that they had eliminated over 145 rebels. The operation has involved suicide bombings, grenade attacks on police stations, and the capturing of highways to block military. Instances of violence were reported through Monday also though the scale seems to have reduced.","Two fidayeen women led attacks through Balochistan targeting govt offices, banks and Frontier corps HQ.

Iran arrests an Oscar-nominated screenwriter for criticising Khamenei regime,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iran-arrests-an-oscar-nominated-screenwriter-for-criticising-khamenei-regime/articleshow/127873878.cms,"Mehdi Mahmoudian (File photo)





An Iranian screenwriter nominated for an Academy Award was arrested after signing a statement condemning his govt for its deadly crackdown on protesters, a human rights group reported. Mehdi Mahmoudian, a co-writer of the film “It Was Just an Accident,” was among several signatories to the letter who were detained on Saturday, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.Seventeen prominent lawyers, artists and activists signed the letter, which blamed Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, for the recent killings and arrests of thousands of protesters who took to the streets across the country. There was no information about where Mahmoudian and other signatories were being held, the rights agency said. It also was not clear what they were being charged with, and there has been no public comment from the govt, BBC Persian reported on Saturday. The news outlet cited Hossein Razzagh, a prominent activist.On Sunday, BBC Persian reported that Mahmoudian had spoken to a lawyer, and a post on Mahmoudian’s social media said that he had briefly contacted his family to inform them of his arrest and health, but that he was not allowed to provide further details.The arrests come after more than a month of demonstrations in the capital, Tehran, initially over economic hardship. The protests quickly spread and turned into widespread calls for a new govt. As the demonstrations grew, the protesters were increasingly met with deadly force.The letter held Khamenei directly accountable for the govt’s violent response to the demonstrations and for “the repressive structure of the regime.” “This authoritarian apparatus has relied on mass killings to ensure its survival while ignoring the basic and inalienable rights of citizens — including the fundamental right to seek change in the political system,” it said. The signers called for the prosecution of those behind the repression. Mahmoudian, who has also been a human-rights activist, is no stranger to detention in Iran. He met Jafar Panahi, the director and one of the co-writers of “It Was Just an Accident,” when both were in prison.","Mehdi Mahmoudian, a co-writer of the film “It Was Just an Accident,’ was among several signatories to the letter.

At the 68th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles on February 1, 2026, singer Billie Eilish used her acceptance speech to make a political statement that went viral online. Eilish won the Song of the Year award for “Wildflower,” which she co‑wrote and performed with her brother Finneas O’Connell.During her speech on stage, Eilish said, “No one is illegal on stolen land” and called for continued protest and activism. She and Finneas both wore pins reading “ICE Out,” opposing US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) policies. Eilish went on to say that voices matter and urged people to continue speaking up in support of immigrant rights. Parts of her remarks were directed at ICE, which were censored on live broadcast.Eilish’s comments quickly became a major topic on social media within hours of the broadcast ending. Several users on platforms like X criticized her for speaking about “stolen land” while owning expensive homes in Los Angeles. Many pointed out that she owns a $2.3 million ranch‑style home in Glendale, California, which she purchased in 2019 and that is now worth even more, in addition to her family’s Highland Park property in Los Angeles that’s valued at around $800,000.Some posts specifically referenced her multimillion‑dollar properties and suggested she should “give up” or “sell” them if she truly believed in the historical meaning of her statement, with some comments also referring to discussions about land that once belonged to Native American tribes in the Los Angeles area","Billie Eilish won Song of the Year at the 68th Annual Grammy Awards on February 1, 2026.

A Brazilian influencer who publicly supported US President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has been detained by US immigration authorities, despite previously insisting that only criminals were targeted for deportation.Júnior Pena, whose full name is Eustáquio da Silva Pena Júnior, was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Saturday in New Jersey, according to Brazilian outlet Brazilian Times. Pena is known for his pro-Trump views and for posting videos about life in the United States as an immigrant.A source told the outlet that Pena’s detention was due to an administrative issue involving an immigration hearing. The hearing had reportedly been postponed, but the change was not properly recorded in the system, leading authorities to mark Pena as absent when he did not attend.Pena has a large online following, with around 1.3 million followers on TikTok and nearly 500,000 on Instagram. On his platforms, he often described the “reality of the USA” and openly voiced support for Trump.After Trump assumed office for his second term, the president promised an immigration crackdown that focused heavily on Latin American immigrants in its first six months.During that period, Pena told his Brazilian audience that those being targeted were criminals.“I wanted to tell you not to be so scared, there are many people scared. There are many influencers spreading fear among immigrants without having facts, evidence, or proof that so-and-so was deported,” Pena said in one video. He also claimed that those detained were “crooks.”The crackdown has led to the deaths of two American citizens named Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and triggered protests against ICE across several states.According to a December report citing Brazil’s Federal Police, 2,268 Brazilian nationals were deported from the United States in 2025, the highest number recorded since data collection began in 2020.Pena came to the US in 2009 and is currently being held at Delaney Hall Detention Center in Newark while his lawyer, Andrew Lattarulo, works to block his transfer to another state.His detention has sparked strong reactions online, with social media accusing him of “self-sabotage” and warning that he promoted an unrealistic version of the American dream. A GoFundMe campaign was launched to cover legal and court costs, reaching its $32,000 goal by Monday.","Júnior Pena was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Saturday in New Jersey.

Nancy Guthrie, the 84‑year‑old mother of Savannah Guthrie, co‑anchor of NBC’s Today show, was reported missing from her home near Tucson, Arizona, and authorities are now treating the case as a possible crime, law enforcement officials said.Nancy was last seen at her home in the Catalina Foothills area north of Tucson on the evening of Saturday, January 31, according to the Pima County Sheriff’s Department. Her family reported her missing to police around noon on Sunday, February 1, after she failed to arrive at church and could not be reached.Sheriff Chris Nanos said there were concerning signs at the residence, and law enforcement has officially declared the home a crime scene. Officials said there is reason to believe Guthrie did not leave her house on her own.“Nancy Guthrie is of great sound mind,” a sheriff’s official said, noting that the 84‑year‑old has no known cognitive issues. However, she has physical limitations and requires daily medication, which could be life‑threatening if she goes without it for too long.Nancy is described by authorities as about 5 feet 5 inches tall, weighing around 150 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes.She lives alone at her residence near East Skyline Drive and North Campbell Avenue in Tucson.Law enforcement has launched a wide search effort, including volunteers, drones, helicopters and search dogs, but as of Monday Nancy had not been located. Sheriff Nanos said homicide detectives have been called in because of the unusual conditions found at her home.Savannah Guthrie was absent from the Today show on Monday as the search continued. In a statement read by colleagues on the broadcast, she thanked law enforcement and members of the public for their support and asked anyone with information to contact the Pima County Sheriff’s Department. Officials have asked neighbours to check home security footage and report anything unusual.No further details about Nancy’s disappearance have been released, and investigators have not identified any suspects.","Nancy Guthrie, 84, was reported missing from her home near Tucson, Arizona.

Epstein case: Hillary and Bill Clinton to testify in House,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-case-hillary-and-bill-clinton-to-testify-in-house/articleshow/127874168.cms,"Epstein Files Fuel Clinton Vs GOP Showdown: Bill In Contempt For Rejecting Testimony | Watch

(With inputs from agencies)





Former US President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before the house oversight committee as part of its investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after Republican lawmakers moved toward holding them in criminal contempt of Congress.House oversight committee chair Republican representative James Comer said late Monday that attorneys for the Clintons had informed committee staff that both would comply with the subpoenas and “will appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates.” However, Comer said no final agreement had been reached and that contempt proceedings were still on the table.“We don't have anything in writing,” Comer told reporters, adding that while he was open to accepting the offer, “it depends on what they say.”The last-minute talks came as Republican leaders advanced contempt resolutions through the house rules committee, the final step before a vote on the house floor. If approved and prosecuted by the department of justice, criminal contempt charges could carry penalties including fines and possible jail time – an unprecedented step against a former president.Earlier on Monday, Comer rejected a proposal from the Clintons’ attorneys that would have allowed Bill Clinton to sit for a four-hour transcribed interview while Hillary Clinton submitted a sworn written statement.Comer insisted that both testify under oath in sworn depositions to meet the committee’s subpoenas.“The Clintons do not get to dictate the terms of lawful subpoenas,” Comer said.The oversight committee subpoenaed both Clintons in August as it launched its investigation into Epstein and his associates. Their attorneys had challenged the validity of the subpoenas, but negotiations resumed after Comer threatened contempt proceedings.The Republican-controlled panel voted last month to advance criminal contempt charges, with nine Democrats joining Republicans in backing the move against Bill Clinton, and three Democrats supporting the charge against Hillary Clinton.Republicans have renewed scrutiny of Bill Clinton’s past association with Epstein, who died by suicide in a New York jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges. Clinton’s interactions with Epstein in the late 1990s and early 2000s have been documented, though he has not been accused of wrongdoing.The Clintons have criticised Comer’s handling of the investigation, accusing him of politicising the probe while failing to press the Trump administration over delays in releasing Justice Department files related to Epstein.“They negotiated in good faith. You did not,” Clinton spokesperson Angel Ureña said. “They told you under oath what they know, but you don’t care.”House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said his caucus would discuss the contempt resolutions later this week but made clear his opposition. Jeffries said he was a “hard no” on contempt and accused Republicans of pursuing political retribution rather than addressing the delayed release of Epstein-related records.“They don’t want a serious interview, they want a charade,” Jeffries said.Historically, Congress has shown deference to former presidents, none of whom has ever been compelled to testify before lawmakers, though some have done so voluntarily.","Former US President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before the house oversight committee.

Influencer @stackz posted a video on Feb. 1 joking that he was trying to sleep under a pile of cold-stunned iguanas, creating what appeared to be a “blanket” of the reptiles. The iguanas were easy to capture because they were in a state of torpor, temporarily losing muscle control. In the video, @stackz said he did not kill the iguanas, adding, “We love everything with a heartbeat. ”Iguanas become “cold-stunned” when air temperatures near or fall below freezing, causing them to lose muscle control and fall from branches in a motionless state.In South Florida, residents have been collecting these stunned reptiles and bringing them to facilities run by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC). The FWC issued a temporary order allowing the public to capture and transport cold-stunned green iguanas without a permit during the freeze, a change from normal rules that restrict possession and movement of the invasive species.","Iguanas become “cold-stunned” when air temperatures near or fall below freezing, causing them to lose muscle control and fall from branches.

"Stanford students pretend to be Jains to escape $7,944 mandatory meal plan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stanford-students-pretend-to-be-jains-to-escape-7944-mandatory-meal-plan/articleshow/127872443.cms,"How Jain identity entered the Stanford dining debate

Online reaction and wider debate





A Stanford student essay claimed that some undergraduates falsely identify as Jain to bypass the university’s $7,944 mandatory meal plan. The allegation, which has circulated widely on social media, suggests that students use religious dietary exemptions to redirect their dining funds to off-campus grocery stores such as Whole Foods, where they believe food options are fresher or better suited to their preferences. The claim is based on anecdotal observations and student conversations rather than official university records.The controversy stems from an opinion essay written by Stanford undergraduate Sebastian Connolly and published in The New York Times. Connolly described a campus culture of “optimisation,” arguing that students openly discuss ways to work around rules, including claiming Jain identity to qualify for dining exemptions. The essay did not present institutional figures or disciplinary cases, instead relying on personal observation and student conversations.Jainism has strict dietary principles that emphasise non-violence toward all living beings. Followers typically follow a strict vegetarian diet, avoiding meat, fish, eggs, and foods that involve harm to living organisms. Many Jains also avoid root vegetables such as onions, garlic, potatoes, and carrots, as harvesting them can kill the entire plant and disturb microorganisms in the soil.Because of these constraints, many universities, including Stanford, allow religious accommodations when campus dining cannot reasonably meet such requirements. Students granted exemptions may be permitted to opt out of standard meal plans and spend dining funds elsewhere.Stanford requires most undergraduates living on campus to enrol in a meal plan. The university also states that exemptions can be granted for documented religious or medical reasons. However, the institution does not publicly release data on how many students claim religious dietary exemptions, how those claims are reviewed, or whether misuse is investigated.The claim has fuelled wider debate over the cost of college meal plans, the quality of campus dining, and how accommodation systems are used. Some commentators say it reflects growing frustration among students with expensive and inflexible dining rules. Others caution that unverified allegations should not be confused with the practices of the religion itself, noting that the issue, if it exists, concerns individual behaviour rather than Jain dietary traditions.Beyond Stanford, the issue points to a wider strain across universities. Students are facing rising costs and limited flexibility, pushing some to look for any lawful way to stretch their budgets. At the same time, universities depend on trust-based systems to honour genuine religious and medical needs without turning accommodations into an exercise in policing identity.","Stanford student essay claimed that some undergraduates falsely identify as Jain to bypass the university’s $7,944 mandatory meal plan.

Jeffrey Epstein has a ‘secret son’? Explosive DOJ emails show he was congratulated for ‘baby boy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jeffrey-epstein-has-a-secret-son-explosive-doj-emails-show-he-was-congratulated-for-baby-boy/articleshow/127870796.cms,"Documents released by US Justice Department on Jeffery Epstein.

“Don’t know if you’re still on this bbm

but have heard from The Duke that you have had a baby boy. Even though you never kept in touch, I am still here with love, friendship and congratulations on your baby boy.”

The email, which appears to be from Sarah Ferguson (DoJ)

“You have disappeared,”

“I did not even know you were having a baby. It was sooooo crystal clear to me that you were only friends with me to get to Andrew … and that really hurt me deeeply.”

What the files do, and do not, establish

Wider revelations involving the Duke of York

New images of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor were released with the latest Epstein files (DoJ)





Newly released US Department of Justice documents suggest that Jeffrey Epstein may have had a secret son, after an email emerged in which Sarah Ferguson, the former Duchess of York, appears to congratulate him on the birth of a “baby boy”.The email, dated September 2011 and disclosed as part of a large tranche of material released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, appears to show Ferguson congratulating Epstein on the birth of a “baby boy”.The email is signed off “Sarah x”. The reference to “The Duke” is widely understood to mean Prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, Ferguson’s former husband. It has never been established that Epstein had any children, and the claim in the message remains unverified. If the claim is accurate, the child would be approximately 14 or 15 years old today.A second email in the same correspondence shows Ferguson expressing frustration that Epstein had “disappeared” after, as she put it, using her to gain access to Andrew.the message reads.Epstein, who died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges, never publicly acknowledged having children. Despite this, more than 100 people have since claimed to be his offspring, largely in connection with attempts to access his estate. According to The Telegraph , his will, amended shortly before his death, left most of his fortune, properties and private island to his last known girlfriend, Karyna Shuliak.In 2020, Harvey Morse, founder of Morse Genealogical Services, said there was “a reasonable chance” Epstein may have fathered a child because he was “sexually promiscuous for so long”, adding: “He could even be a grandfather.” Morse said 130 people contacted his firm after it launched a website inviting potential heirs, though more than a quarter of claims were dismissed almost immediately.Another file released in the same batch includes an unverified claim from a woman who said she had “created” a daughter with Epstein during what she described as a “beautiful fertility ritual”. The US Department of Justice has cautioned that the files contain material that is “untrue and sensationalist”, and that allegations within them should not be treated as established fact.The latest release forms part of more than three million documents, along with roughly 180,000 images and 2,000 videos, made public well after the December 19 deadline set by the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The documents shed further light on Epstein’s network and the extent of his high-level access, naming figures including Bill Clinton, Richard Branson and Naomi Campbell, a mention that does not imply wrongdoing.Within the same tranche, emails suggest that Prince Andrew’s contact with Epstein continued until at least 2017, contradicting his previous claim that he cut off the relationship in 2010.The documents also indicate that Sarah Ferguson offered Epstein and his associates VIP access to Buckingham Palace, while separate files include images of Andrew kneeling over an unidentified woman and emails in which Epstein offered to introduce him to a “beautiful” 26-year-old Russian woman named Irina.Andrew, who was stripped of his remaining royal titles and public roles last year, has consistently denied any allegations of sexual misconduct.","The email appears to show Ferguson congratulating Epstein on the birth of a ‘baby boy’ The reference to ‘The Duke’ is widely understood to mean Prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.

Minneapolis school where ICE detained 5-year-old receives bomb threat via email,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/minneapolis-school-where-ice-detained-5-year-old-receives-bomb-threat/articleshow/127870971.cms,"



A Minneapolis school closed all classes on Monday after receiving a bomb threat, authorities said. The district said the closures were “out of an abundance of caution” after an emailed threat targeted several schools.Columbia Heights Public School's superintendent Zena Stenvik told MS NOW, “The bomb threat to the school district definitely didn’t help with with our sense of safety and security.”Authorities swept all schools in the district and found no active threat. Classes are expected to resume on Tuesday.The threat came just one day after 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrián Alexander Conejo Arias, returned home from an immigration facility in South Texas. Liam is a preschooler in the Minneapolis district and was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on January 20. Photos of him wearing a fuzzy blue bunny beanie and a Spider-Man backpack went viral online, which brought in national attention to ICE’s aggressive detention practices under the Trump administration.A federal judge ordered the release of Liam and his father on Saturday and called their detention as an “imposition of cruelty” by the Trump administration.US District Judge Fred Biery said: “The case has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children.”Liam and his father were released from the Dilley family detention centre on Sunday and returned to Minneapolis.The school superintendent Stenvik said she spoke with Liam’s mother after he arrived home and confirmed he will return to school with a support plan once he has recovered.Four other children from the district are still being held at Dilley. Stenvik said, “Some of our youngest students are very aware of what is happening. They see it with their own eyes, as well… the kids are coming to school asking about it because they see it.”Stenvik criticised the impact on children, saying, “I am confident that this will have long lasting negative impacts on children, and I really just find it to be senseless again. Cases that we’re working with, like Liam’s family’s case, they entered the United States legally. They were following the rules.”","Columbia Heights Public School's superintendent Zena Stenvik told MS NOW, “The bomb threat to the school district definitely didn’t help with with our sense of safety and security”Authorities swept all schools in the district and found no active threat.

"‘Hired green card, US citizen drivers’: Sikh truck company owner after losing employees as California revoked thousands of licences",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hired-green-card-us-citizen-drivers-sikh-truck-company-owner-after-losing-employees-as-california-revoked-thousands-of-licences/articleshow/127869696.cms,"



When California cancelled thousands of commercial trucking licences a few months ago, Sikh owner Bikramjeet Singh Gill watched his Stockton truck yard fall silent.Trucks that once rolled out each morning now sit idle, unused and unpaid.Gill runs Gillson Trucking Inc. and said around 35 of his immigrant drivers were told lastyear that the California Department of Motor Vehicles was cancelling their commercial driver’s licences. They were gone overnight.“We have lost nearly $2 million in the last four months while paying $200,000 monthly to the bank and insurers for 35 parked trucks. The banks don’t wait,” Gill was quoted as saying to CalMatters.The cancellations followed a September audit by the Trump administration, which cracked down on over 17,000 California commercial licences held by immigrants. The audit found that some licences had expiration dates that extended beyond drivers’ legal authorisation to live and work in US. California later notified those drivers that their licences would be revoked.New federal rules introduced last year could eventually take away licences from up to 61,000 immigrant truck drivers across the country.The impact has fallen heavily on California’s Sikh community. Industry groups estimate about 35 per cent of the state’s commercial drivers are Sikh, many of them based in the Central Valley. Truck driving has long provided stable income for Sikh immigrants who often took loans and had to pay debt to settle in US.The Sikh Coalition has filed a lawsuit challenging California’s decision to cancel non-domicile commercial licences. The group says the move unfairly targets immigrant drivers.“When someone loses their CDL, they lose their livelihood,” said Munmeeth Kaur, the Sikh Coalition’s legal director.The Trump administration has defended the crackdown and has threatened to withhold transportation funding from California over 'delays' in cancelling licences.US transportation secretary Sean Duffy earlier this month said: “It’s a day for Gavin Newsom and California. Our demands were simple: follow the rules, revoke the unlawfully-issued licenses to dangerous foreign drivers, and fix the system so this never happens again.""Gill said in October, nearly 100 trucks sat parked at his depot.“It totally devastated us,” he said.He added: “Slowly, some drivers returned to work because they also have mortgages and financial obligations. We have hired green card or U.S. citizen drivers.”Gill said companies followed state rules when hiring. “Acording to the law, if someone has work authorization and valid licenses then we can hire him. We can’t discriminate against anyone,” he said.Fear has spread among drivers after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested truckers at inspection sites. “Our driver was recently arrested by ICE while standing at a truck stop in Minnesota”, Gill said. The driver remains in detention.Drivers are also removing Sikh imagery from trucks amid fears of harassment. “Every driver displays pictures or signs representing what inspires him,” Gill said.He added: “Now they removed them. The drivers say people record videos of their trucks and post them on social media or honk at them aggressively.”","Trucks that once rolled out each morning now sit idle, unused and unpaid.

GOP Rep. Nancy Mace under fire after ex-staffers allege bizarre ‘hotness rankings’ demands,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gop-rep-nancy-mace-under-fire-after-ex-staffers-allege-bizarre-hotness-rankings-demands/articleshow/127869951.cms,"Burner accounts and ‘hotness rankings’



Pattern of public confrontations and personal allegations



Netizens react







Republican Rep. Nancy Mace is facing renewed scrutiny after former staffers accused her of erratic, inappropriate behaviour behind closed doors, allegations that they say mirror the South Carolina lawmaker’s increasingly volatile public conduct.In a detailed report by New York Magazine, multiple unnamed former aides claimed Mace made bizarre and, at times, potentially unethical demands during her first term in Congress, long before her recent string of public controversies.According to the report, Mace would allegedly pressure staffers to bring alcohol to her home to keep parties going well past midnight, behaviour that could constitute an abuse of office under House ethics rules.“When I worked for her, our poor scheduler was getting calls at two o’clock in the morning to come bring her bottles of tequila,” a former staffer told New York Magazine.Former aides also alleged that Mace frequently blurred professional boundaries, leaving staffers exhausted, fearful, and unsure how to push back against her demands.The report further alleges that Mace instructed staffers to create burner accounts to defend her online and to boost her appearance rankings on Reddit.According to multiple sources, the 48-year-old lawmaker told a staffer to visit forums that rank the “hottest women in Congress” and actively improve her standing. One former aide said Mace was “very adamant” that the staffer upvote posts about her attractiveness and leave comments.Mace’s office forcefully rejected the claims. Cameron Morabito, her director of operations, dismissed the allegations in a statement to New York Magazine, saying: “These allegations are so ridiculous they don’t even merit a response. I hope she sues you for every dime you got paid to write this defamatory bullshit.”Ahead of the article’s publication, Mace also addressed the story in a video posted on X, calling it a “hit piece.”“The establishment is coming after me again,” she said. “If I have enemies, good. Get in line. It means I’ve done something, it means I’ve stood for something… I’ve never been a good old boy, I never will be.”The allegations arrive as Mace, now a vocal Donald Trump loyalist and a candidate for governor of South Carolina, has drawn attention for a series of public incidents.Last year, she accused her former fiancé, Patrick Bryant, 51, of assault and of participating in a conspiracy to drug, rape and film other women during a speech on the House floor. Bryant has denied the allegations and has since sued Mace for defamation.She has also faced criticism for an expletive-filled confrontation with police officers at Charleston Airport during the government shutdown and for a shouting match earlier this month with Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts during a House Oversight Committee meeting.Former staffers told New York Magazine that while they are inclined to believe Mace’s accusations against Bryant, despite never witnessing anything themselves, they said they question her judgment and emotional stability.They alleged that Mace drinks and uses marijuana “excessively,” and said they were afraid of her behaviour in the workplace.“She would make staffers cry,” one unnamed former aide said. “She would threaten to fire them, take their money away, not give them raises, not to give them days off, religious days.”Staffers also claimed they were made to clean properties Mace rented out on Airbnb—including a $3.9 million home in Isle of Palms, South Carolina, and her Washington townhouse, instead of hiring professional cleaners.One user said, ""Honestly kind of sad. She’s a congresswoman. In theory, she should be confident and know she’s accomplished so much, and is fierce. But unfortunately the political climate has devolved into name calling and bullying appearances by literally the most hideous people I’ve ever seen""Another said, ""Odd but not surprising… The only way she could move past many of her colleagues is by cheating!""Third said, ""I am so embarrassed for her omg""","Republican Rep.

Indian-origin Texas GOP leader Abraham George came under fire after Republicans flipped a state Senate seat that historically remained with the Republicans. Democrat Taylor Rehmet defeated Republican Leigh Wambsganss by a decisive 57% to 43% in Tarrant County. The result is insignificant legislation-wise as the new candidate will now serve a year of the term, as it was a special election, as the incumbent moved to another post; but as far as political significance is concerned, the result is nothing short of an earthquake, according to experts.While the MAGA blamed the Indian-American community for 'colonizing' Texas and voting for Dems, the Indian-origin GOP leader Abraham George came under fire. MAGA social media handles dug up his past brush with the law, demanding his elimination from the post.Before Abraham George became the Texas GOP chairman, police were called to his address in 2023 when he was confronting a man believed to be having an affair with his wife. George had a loaded gun with him. He was not arrested or charged and no one was injured. He and his wife later issued a statement asserting that their marriage was strong.Like every family, they had some misunderstandings and disputes.The police were called by one of his young children who were scared seeing their parents fighting and their father pulling a gun. It was alleged that Abraham suspected his wife had an affair with someone from the church.Another allegation claimed that in 2020, Abraham George had an outburst in his Indian church in Dallas when he allegedly yelled abuses. He allegedly kicked one person with such force that he broke the pastor's door.Many Indian-American community leaders commented on the Texas result and called it MAGA fatigue, though Indian-American voters could not have caused this swing alone.","Republican Taylor Rehmet defeated Republican Leigh Wambsganss by a decisive 57% to 43% in Tarrant County.

In a bizarre case, police in Pakistan’s Rawalpindi district registered a case on Sunday of abduction against a “jinn” (supernatural spirit) following the disappearance of an 11-year-old boy, news agency ANI reported, citing ARY News.The incident occurred in the garrison city when the boy went missing from his home on January 21. After ten days without any sign of the child, his father approached the Taxila Police Station and filed a First Information Report (FIR).In the FIR, the father alleged that supernatural entities, known locally as jinns, had forced his son to run away.The complainant said that this is not the first time such an incident has occurred. He added that the jinns had “abducted” his son several times before.He highlighted that while the boy had returned home after previous incidents, this time ten days had passed without his return, prompting him to formally accuse the supernatural spirits of kidnapping.According to ARY News, similar claims have been reported in Pakistan’s legal system before. In Lahore, a mother had lodged a case against jinns over the disappearance of her married daughter, a matter that eventually reached the courts.A report by Dawn in September stated that a special investigation team of Lahore police was formed under the directions of the city's high court Chief Justice Aalia Neelam to probe the six-year-old case of the missing woman, believed to have been abducted by a jinn.The team, headed by Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Raza, was tasked with locating and recovering the woman.","11-year-old boy went missing from his home in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on January 21.

Pakistan’s Balochistan Operation Under Scrutiny As India Calls Out Deflection Tactics To Shift Blame

(With PTI inputs)





Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January, data released on Monday by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) showed.The fatalities included 242 militants, 73 civilians, and 46 security personnel, according to the Islamabad-based think tank.At least 135 people were injured, among them 71 were civilians, 52 security personnel, and 12 militants.PICSS reported 87 militant attacks across Pakistan in January, a 28% rise from the 68 incidents recorded in December 2025. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bore the brunt, with 58 incidents—38 in the mainland districts and 20 in the tribal areas. The restive Balochistan followed with 27 attacks, while Punjab reported two targeted incidents.Balochistan emerged as the main theatre of militant violence and security operations, recording its highest monthly militant death toll since the current insurgency began in 2001. While the province remained relatively calm for most of January, violence surged dramatically in the final two days. Coordinated attacks by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) across at least 12 locations, followed by intensified security operations, placed the province at the centre of the conflict.At least 172 militants were killed, the majority in the final two days of last month.Security forces arrested at least 60 suspected militants during the previous month, while militant groups kidnapped eight individuals. In Punjab, 53 militants were arrested, 48 of them from Lahore, the state capital and Pakistan's second-largest city.Meanwhile, no militant attacks were reported in January from Sindh, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), Islamabad, or the Gilgit-Baltistan region, according to the data.","Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January. The fatalities included 242 militants, 73 civilians, and 46 security personnel. Balochistan emerged as the main theatre of militant violence and security operations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127861800,imgsize-109604,width-400,resizemode-4/ttp-attack-pakistan-army.jpg"

Balochistan Crisis: Pakistan-Origin Commentator Takes Apart Islamabad, Exposes Lies On India

What is clear: the scale, coordination and symbolism of the violence mark a sharp escalation in a conflict long treated by Islamabad as containable.

Why it matters

The big picture

What's different now is the interplay of three key factors:

Zoom in: What is ""Herof""?

Herof Phase 2.0 expands on that template:

Geographic spread: Violence has been reported in Quetta, Noshki, Mastung, Kalat, Kharan, Panjgur, Gwadar, Pasni, Turbat, Kech and Awaran.

Operational depth: Suicide bombings, vehicle-borne explosives and armed assaults occurred almost simultaneously.

Human footprint: For the first time, women are reported to be participating in direct combat roles alongside men.

What they are saying

Between the lines

Zoom in: Bashir Zaib's message

The regional angle

What’s next

The bottom line





Pakistan's latest surge of violence in Balochistan reflects a deepening, not isolated, security crisis as the Baloch Liberation Army escalates its campaign through ""Operation Herof.""Over several days, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) unleashed what it calls ""Operation Herof, Phase 2.0,"" a wave of coordinated attacks across Balochistan that included suicide bombings, gun assaults and arson in major towns and remote districts alike.Pakistani authorities say dozens of civilians and security personnel were killed, followed by one of the largest counterterrorism strikes in decades. Officials claim more than 130 militants were killed in 48 hours alone. However, the BLA has refuted these official claims and reiterate that it inflicted severe casualties on Pakistan forces.Balochistan sits at the intersection of Pakistan’s security, economy and foreign policy- and all three are now under strain. The province anchors China’s Belt and Road ambitions through the port of Gwadar, hosts globally significant mineral deposits at Reko Diq, and borders both Iran and Afghanistan at a time of regional instability.As analyst Michael Kugelman put it after the attacks, ""Today’s attacks in Balochistan should serve as a wake up call to those… keen to invest in Pakistan’s critical mineral reserves."" He warned that many of those reserves lie in areas now directly hit by violence- and that resentment over ""external exploitation of local resources"" is central to the insurgency.For Islamabad, the stakes go beyond security. Investor confidence, relations with Beijing, and Pakistan’s credibility as a destination for critical minerals are all on the line.Balochistan's troubles are hardly new, but they're shiftingSince Pakistan's birth, Baloch ethnic factions have, time and again, risen up against the central government. They've sought more autonomy, a larger share of the country's wealth, or even complete independence. Each insurrection has been met with military force, temporary quiet, and, ultimately, unaddressed issues.First, economic importance. Balochistan is now crucial to Pakistan's economic story. Think of the Chinese-funded projects and the West's interest in copper, gold, and rare minerals.Second, political disillusionment. Elections since 2018 have been widely criticized, and the space for peaceful opposition has shrunk. This has intensified the feeling that political solutions are impossible.Third, the evolution of militant groups. Organizations like the BLA have become more dangerous, adept at using the media, and ideologically focused. They've adopted tactics from global insurgencies while staying rooted in local grievances.As per a report in the Native Voices: ""Herof is a Balochi literary term meaning ""black storm"", commonly used in Baloch poetry, including by the veteran poet Karim Dashti.""The BLA first used the term in August 2024, launching Herof 1.0 with attacks across 12 districts. That campaign shocked authorities by striking areas previously considered relatively stable, including Lasbela and Musakhel, and by introducing a female suicide bomber into the group’s operations.An intelligence officer cited by Native Voices estimated 800 to 1,000 fighters may be involved- a number that suggests months of recruitment, training and coordination.Pakistani officials describe the violence as foreign-orchestrated terrorism.Balochistan chief minister Sarfraz Bugti said security forces killed 145 members of what he termed ""Fitna al-Hindustan,"" the state’s label for the BLA. He claimed militants aimed to seize hostages and storm government installations, and alleged backing from India and Afghanistan- accusations both countries deny.Residents recount chaos and fear. ""(It) was a very scary day in the history of Quetta,"" said Khan Muhammad, a local resident, describing armed men openly patrolling streets before security forces moved in.India’s foreign ministry rejected Pakistan’s claims, calling them ""baseless,"" and urged Islamabad to address ""long-standing demands of its people in the region"" instead of deflecting blame outward.As per the Native Voices, the Baloch resentment has roots in a series of flashpoints.Several incidents hardened public anger: the killing of university student Hayat Baloch by paramilitary forces in 2020; the death of Malik Naz inside her home the same year; the crackdown on the Haq Do Tehreek protests in Gwadar; and the custodial killing of Baalach Mula Baksh in 2023. Each episode sparked protests. Each was followed by arrests, internet shutdowns, or worse.The arrest of activist Dr Mahrang Baloch in 2025 marked another turning point. To many young Baloch, her detention signaled that even peaceful dissent had become intolerable. Analysts say that belief has fed recruitment into armed groups, including among women, a shift now visible on the battlefield.Each episode narrowed political space- and widened the insurgency’s recruitment pool.As Kugelman noted, framing the crisis solely around body counts ""telegraphs your policy failures- because the question is why are there so many fighters to start with."" Analysts argue the BLA has successfully tapped into accumulated resentment, especially among young Baloch who see peaceful activism punished and armed resistance rewarded with attention.One of the most striking elements of Herof II has been its media choreography.As per the Native Voices, the BLA released new footage of its leader Bashir Zaib, seated on the back of a motorcycle, moving through rugged terrain believed to lie between Kharan and Chagai- a region synonymous with mineral wealth.Observers see layered symbolism: mobility, control and defiance. A senior Baloch journalist described the location choice as deliberate- close to Reko Diq and other high-profile mining sites that have drawn interest from companies like Barrick Gold and financiers such as the Asian Development Bank.The subtext to Islamabad and investors alike: the insurgency can operate where Pakistan’s economic future is being planned.Timing matters.Analysts believe the BLA launched Herof II amid unrest in neighboring Iran’s Baloch-populated regions and persistent instability in Afghanistan to amplify its message beyond Pakistan’s borders.Balochistan’s long frontier with Iran- and proximity to Gulf shipping lanes- means sustained violence here resonates in Middle Eastern, US and European policy circles, particularly as Western governments search for alternatives to Chinese-dominated mineral supply chains.The message appears aimed as much at foreign capitals as at Islamabad.In the short term, security operations will intensify. Expect heavier troop deployments, stricter controls around mining projects, transport corridors and Chinese-linked infrastructure, and continued information blackouts during operations. Islamabad will likely double down on its claims of foreign sponsorship, even as evidence remains contested.The longer-term trajectory is murkier.The paradox facing Pakistan is stark: Balochistan is now too economically important to ignore- but remains too politically neglected to stabilize.Unless that gap is addressed, the ""black storm"" the BLA invokes may only deepen, reshaping the conflict from a peripheral insurgency into a central challenge to the state.The spy-action film Dhurandhar has inadvertently revived global interest in the region by featuring elements that touch on Pakistan’s underworld and geopolitics set around Baloch communities.Dhurandhar revolves around a simple but unsettling idea: in covert conflict, what matters most is not the spectacle of action but the slow, almost invisible shifts beneath it. That logic offers a useful lens for what’s happening in Balochistan.Today, Balochistan can no longer be treated only as a security issue measured through attacks and casualties. It has become a political problem rooted in governance, representation, and legitimacy, and it cannot be managed through messaging, denial, or communication blackouts.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) unleashed what it calls ""Operation Herof, Phase 2.0,"" a wave of coordinated attacks across Balochistan that included suicide bombings, gun assaults and arson in major towns and remote districts alike.

At least 15 civilians, 18 security personnel and 92 rebels were killed after Baloch separatist fighters carried out a “coordinated” wave of attacks across 12 locations in Pakistan’s Balochistan province, officials said on Saturday.

The coordinated gun and suicide attacks are being carried out across Balochistan, mainly in Quetta, Pasni, Mastung, Nushki and Gwadar districts,"" news agency AFP reported, quoting a senior security official based in the provincial capital Quetta.The official talking about the death toll further added, ""seventy terrorists have been eliminated... Ten security personnel were martyred while a few others were injured"", he spoke on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. ""At least four policemen were killed in Quetta alone.""According to the reports, the Baloch Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the attacks. The rebel group said that they aimed to target military installations and police and civil administration officials.With this attack, the group has declared the second phase of ""Operation Herof"", news agency ANI reported, citing The Balochistan Post (TBP). BLA had earlier stated about their plans to launch a new phase to ""protect the motherland.""Following the insurgent incident, security in the region has been ramped up. Emergency teams have been deployed in multiple cities.No reports of civilian casuality has been reported by the officials as of now.Confirming the attack, a senior official stated that the attack was ""coordinated but poorly executed."" He also said that the insurgents could not inflict damage due to the swift security response.""The attacks failed due to poor planning and rapid collapse under an effective security response.""The situation is yet to get under control, as per the reports.For decades, Pakistan has faced a separatist insurgency in Balochistan, a mineral-rich southwestern province bordering Afghanistan and Iran, where rebels have repeatedly targeted security forces, foreign nationals, and people from outside the region.","At least 15 civilians, 18 security personnel and 92 rebels were killed after Baloch separatist fighters carried out a “coordinated” wave of attacks across 12 locations in Pakistan’s Balochistan province.

Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir As Pakistan Buys Global Influence





Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif revealed that both he and field marshal Asim Munir were forced to 'beg' billions in loans from friendly nations to bridge the country’s external financing gap.Speaking to leading exporters and business leaders at an event in Islamabad, Sharif said Pakistan’s growing dependence on foreign loans is humiliating and often forces officials to agree to unjustifiable demands.""We feel ashamed when Field Marshal Asim Munir and I go around the world begging for money,” he said, reported ANI citing local news.“Taking loans is a huge burden on our self-respect. Our heads bow down in shame.We cannot say NO to many things they want us to do,” Sharif added.Sharif praised Pakistan’s key allies—China, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar—for standing by Islamabad through difficult times, calling China the country’s “all-weather friend.”This is not the first time the premier has expressed discomfort over seeking loans. In January 2023, he said it embarrassed him to ask for further loans, despite acknowledging Saudi Arabia’s financial support.He has repeatedly stressed the need for Pakistan to achieve self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on IMF programmes.Notably, Pakistan is currently facing a severe debt crisis, with total public debt exceeding Rs 76,000 billion as of March 2025, nearly doubling in just four years. The nation relies heavily on IMF bailouts and loans from China--particularly for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects--to manage debt servicing and avoid default.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at strengthening economic stability and climate resilience.","Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir.

Imran Khan Tagged ‘Security Threat’ As Pakistan Army Launches Fiercest Public Attack In Years





The Pakistani government is doubling down on its legal offensive against jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and prominent activists, framing the measures as essential for “national security. ” However, as prison doors remain barred to visitors and human rights lawyers face decade-long sentences, critics warn that the country’s democratic space is vanishing under the shadow of military influence.Officials say restrictions placed on Khan, including the suspension of prison visits, were imposed after he violated jail rules that prohibit political activity and the dissemination of what authorities describe as anti-state narratives. The government and military deny claims that the measures amount to illegal isolation or an attempt to silence him.Interior minister Talal Chaudhry has rejected allegations of mistreatment, calling Khan “the most privileged prisoner in Pakistan” and citing access to facilities such as gym equipment and a personal cook. He said the restrictions were lawful and in line with prison regulations.The government also dismisses accusations that the military is driving political decisions.“The civilian government is [taking] decisions. We are all working hand in glove,” Chaudhry said, praising the chief of defence forces as “doing a marvellous job,"" as quoted by BBC. Security sources insist the military operates strictly within constitutional and legal limits.Military spokespersons have argued that certain political narratives pose a growing threat to national security, particularly when a convicted politician is accused of using prison meetings to mobilise public opinion against state institutions. Officials say such actions cross the boundary from political expression into matters of national defence.Authorities stress that legal action against politicians, activists and lawyers is based on violations of existing laws, including the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), rather than an effort to suppress dissent. “Attempts to frame law-breaking as democracy or human rights are entirely misplaced,” Chaudhry said.The same legal rationale underpinned the recent conviction of human rights lawyer Imaan Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha. The couple were sentenced to 10 years in prison after being found guilty of sharing what the state described as anti-state content on social media.According to prosecutors and the court ruling, their online activity involved “disseminating and propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups” and undermined state institutions. Defending the verdict, information minister Attaullah Tarar said it reflected the proper application of the law, posting on X: “As you sow, so you shall reap!”The government maintains that these measures are necessary to prevent destabilisation and ensure accountability, regardless of an individual’s political profile or public standing.Critics, however, argue that the cases of Khan and Mazari show that he is not the only one being silenced, and warn that the space for dissent in Pakistan is narrowing as the military’s influence continues to loom large over civilian life.",Pakistani government doubles down on legal offensive against jailed former PM Imran Khan.

Imran Khan Tagged ‘Security Threat’ As Pakistan Army Launches Fiercest Public Attack In Years





Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan . The party stated that credible reports suggest that he is suffering from a serious eye condition that could lead to permanent vision loss if not treated urgently.In a statement posted on social media, the party said that Imran had reportedly been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion in his right eye, describing it as a dangerous blockage of the retinal vein that requires immediate and specialised medical care.PTI demanded that Imran be allowed an “unrestricted meeting” with his family and be shifted to a hospital of his choice for treatment, news agency ANI repeorted citing Dawn.According to the party, medical experts who examined Imran inside Adiala jail warned that the condition was extremely sensitive and carried a high risk of permanent damage if not treated promptly.PTI alleged that despite this advice, jail authorities were insisting on providing treatment within the prison, even though the specialist reportedly said such care required an operation theatre and advanced medical facilities.Calling the approach “reckless”, the party said Imran’s eyesight and overall health were in “grave danger”. It also claimed that Imran last met his personal physician in October 2024 and that no further examination had been allowed since then, despite directives from the Islamabad High Court. PTI added that a petition seeking regular medical check-ups had been pending since August 2025.“This is a blatant violation of court orders and a gross breach of fundamental human rights,” the party said, alleging that the government was prioritising political vendetta over a prisoner’s health.PTI warned that if Imran suffered permanent damage to his eyesight, the government and the Adiala jail administration would be held responsible for obstructing his treatment despite medical advice and court orders.The party appealed to the judiciary to treat the issue as one of health and human life rather than politics and demanded that Imran be allowed to undergo treatment at Shaukat Khanum Hospital or any other reputable hospital of his choice.Shaukat Khanum Hospital, founded by Imran Khan, also voiced concern, stating that it was “gravely concerned” about his condition.While expressing confidence in the doctors currently attending to him, the hospital requested that its medical team be allowed immediate access to examine Imran and participate in his care to reassure those concerned about his welfare.Meanwhile, Imran Khan’s sisters questioned the authenticity of reports about his eye condition, saying they had received no official information from jail authorities. Speaking to reporters outside Adiala jail, Noreen Khanum said the family had not been informed of any such diagnosis.“If this is true, we should have been informed so that we could have taken him to the hospital for treatment,” she said, alleging that rumours were being spread to mislead and distress people. She maintained that Imran was healthy and warned against any harm being caused to him.Another sister, Aleema Khanum, said that the jail administration was not sharing updates with the family or legal team and questioned how such information could be leaked without official involvement.“We have just one demand: release Imran Khan,” she said, adding that he had remained incarcerated for over two-and-a-half years because he refused to seek release through a deal.Uzma Khanum said that she last met Imran on December 2 last year and that he did not mention any eyesight issues during that meeting, according to Dawn.However, she recalled that during an earlier visit he had complained of an infection in his right eye and was only given eye drops. “At present, we don’t know anything about the condition of his eye as we are not allowed to meet him,” she said.PTI later claimed that Aleema Khanum was stopped by the police while returning from Adiala jail. The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan alleged that Imran’s sisters were “wrongfully confined” and described it as another misuse of state power.The alliance demanded access for Imran’s family, respect for the right to peaceful assembly and movement, and action against those responsible.Separately, PTI lawmakers arrived at the Islamabad High Court to file a fresh petition seeking permission to meet Imran. PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said Tuesdays were designated for meetings but repeated requests had gone unanswered. He stressed that meeting a prisoner was a legal right and expressed concern over the health of both Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan.

Hamas Seeks To Place 10,000 Police In New US-Backed Gaza Authority Ahead Of Disarmament Talks





Is a bigger terror nexus in the making? A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas, a Middle East-based group often at violent odds with Israel. The two US-designated terrorist organisations have held meetings to discuss expanding their scale and cooperation.This development comes against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump 's proposal to send Pakistani troops to Gaza as part of his ‘Board of Peace’ initiative, aimed at promoting stability and peace in the war-torn region.The proposal was signed and accepted by Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif .While, in a video, a commander of the Pakistani Markazi Muslim League, regarded as the political front of LeT, admitted that he met with Hamas leadership in Doha in 2024.According to a report by the US-based Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), the well-documented nexus between Hamas and terror groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad operating openly on Pakistani soil could undermine international counterterrorism efforts, endangering both regional stability and Western security interests. On January 15, 2026, the US-led intergovernmental organisation Board of Peace, whose stated purpose is to “promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict” in Gaza, was established.On January 18, US President Donald Trump, acting as chair of the organisation, invited Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to join it. However, Pakistan allows Hamas representatives to operate freely on its soil, participate in public events, and forge alliances with local militant groups. This conduct undermines Western efforts to diplomatically isolate Hamas and raises serious questions about whether the United States should continue to regard Pakistan as a 'major non-Nato ally'.The partnership between Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hamas is emerging as a new terror nexus, which could draw the attention of countries like India, Israel, and the United States.The world focuses on demilitarising Hamas in Gaza, ignoring Pakistan’s increasing role as a potential safe haven could allow the group to regroup and strengthen after its Middle East operations.Months ago, Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar suffered a major setback in India’s Operation Sindoor , when precision strikes destroyed its headquarters in Muridke. The organisation may now seek a base farther from India.The recent confession by LeT commander Faisal Nadeem indicates the formation of a front that could engage the attention of nations such as India. Pakistan has a long history of cultivating terror groups that target India, while Hamas continues similar operations against Israel.The MEMRI report also highlighted videos and images from recent events in Pakistan, including the January 2026 LeT-linked gathering in Gujranwala, featuring senior Hamas representative Naji Zaheer alongside LeT operative Rashid Ali Sandhu. These developments underline the growing nexus between Hamas and Pakistan-based terrorist groups. The mastermind of the Pahalgam terror attack in April 2025, Saifullah Kesari, was also reportedly with Nadeem in Doha, a fact the commander confirmed.",A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas.

A wedding celebration turned into a scene of devastation in Pakistan’s north-west after a suicide bomber blew himself up among guests, killing at least seven people and injuring around 25 others, officials said. The attack took place on Friday night in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Police said the blast occurred at the home of Noor Alam Mehsud, a pro-government peace committee leader, where a marriage ceremony was under way. Witnesses said guests had been dancing to the beat of drums when the attacker struck, detonating an explosive vest inside a crowded room.District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed it was a suicide bombing. The force of the explosion caused part of the roof to collapse, trapping several people under debris and complicating rescue efforts. An emergency was declared at the District Headquarters Hospital as ambulances rushed casualties from the site.Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesperson for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122, said multiple ambulances, along with fire and disaster response vehicles, were deployed. Rescue teams worked through the rubble to pull out victims, with some of the wounded reported to be in critical condition.No group immediately claimed responsibility. However, suspicion is likely to fall on Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban, which has carried out frequent attacks in the region. The group is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban and has grown more active since the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Many TTP fighters are believed to operate from across the border.Authorities sealed off the area and launched an investigation. Initial reports suggested that Waheedullah Mehsud, also known as Jigri Mehsud, was among those killed.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi condemned the attack and sought a report from the provincial police chief, saying those responsible would be brought to justice.

Bar leaders allege violence, warn of protests

What was the case?





Pakistan’s prominent human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad. The incident triggered strong condemnation from legal bodies and rights activists over what they described as unconstitutional move.The lawyer couple was on its way to the Additional District and Sessions Court to appear in a case linked to controversial social media posts when police intercepted their vehicle. Arrest warrants had been issued against them on January 16 after the court cancelled their interim bail, news agency PTI reported.The arrest was confirmed by Imaan’s mother, Dr Shireen Mazari, a former federal human rights minister in the Imran Khan government, who said the couple was detained without explanation and taken to undisclosed locations.In a post on X, Mazari said that her daughter and son-in-law “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations,” adding that no arrest warrant or formal document was shown to them at the time, according to Dawn.Calling the incident a sign of repression, she wrote: “Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!”Mazari also shared videos on social media showing police vehicles following the lawyers’ car before blocking it on the road. In the footage, officers were seen opening the car doors, surrounding the vehicle and attempting to pull the occupants out. Another clip showed shattered car windows, which Mazari alleged were broken by the police during the arrest.In a separate post, she claimed that police had used force not only against the couple but also against senior members of the legal fraternity who were accompanying them.“Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari wrote, alleging that the arrest was carried out to prevent further embarrassment to authorities during court proceedings.Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) president Wajid Ali Gilani, who was present at the scene, said the arrest violated assurances given by authorities that the lawyers would be allowed safe passage to court.In a video message shared by Mazari, Gilani said the police attacked the convoy near Serena Chowk, broke car windows, forcibly removed the couple and pushed Imaan into a police vehicle. He also alleged that police officials assaulted IHCBA secretary Manzoor Jajja during the incident.“The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani warned, referring to the mass protests that once challenged military rule in Pakistan.The Islamabad High Court Bar Association, Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrests, calling them illegal and unconstitutional.The IHCBA and IBA announced a strike on Friday, while the IBC called for a nationwide lawyers’ strike on Saturday. The bar councils demanded the immediate release of the couple and an independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved.In a statement, the IBA said the arrest violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Pakistan’s Constitution, stressing that “every citizen has the right to defend themselves in court without fear.”Human Rights Commission of Pakistan strongly condemned the arrest of both lawyers. In a post on X, the organzation wrote: ""HRCP demands immediate disclosure of their whereabouts and holds the authorities fully responsible for any harm. Ms Mazari-Hazir and Mr Chattha must be released immediately.""The primary case against Mazari-Hazir and Chattha stems from a complaint filed in August 2025 with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), accusing Mazari of spreading content allegedly aligned with banned organisations. Her husband was implicated for reposting some of the content.They were indicted in October last year, and arrest warrants were issued after repeated non-appearances led to the cancellation of their interim bail.Additional cases linked to protests and an alleged scuffle outside the Islamabad High Court have also been filed against them, some of which are still under judicial review.","Iaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad.

Dozens feared missing



Compensation announced for victims’ families







The death toll from a devastating fire at a major shopping plaza in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, has risen to 26, with authorities warning that the number could climb further as search operations continue, as reported by Geo TV. The blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.Rescue teams gained fuller access to the building nearly 24 hours later, after firefighters managed to bring the inferno under control. Officials said smoke was still rising from the structure on Monday, complicating efforts to locate missing people.Rescue 1122 Sindh spokesperson Hassan Khan said 21 bodies had been recovered so far, adding that search operations were still under way. “The search will continue,” he said, as concerns remain over possible structural collapses inside the severely damaged building.Mohammed Shah, part of the Pakistan Navy’s rescue team, described the incident as a “deep-seated fire”, noting that smoke continued to emanate from the debris despite the flames being largely extinguished. Firefighters said the blaze had been brought 95 per cent under control, with cooling operations now in progress.Officials warned that the weakened structure posed serious dangers. Portions of the building’s front and back façades have collapsed, while cracks have been detected inside.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said authorities were still trying to establish the final death toll. Speaking at a press conference, he said around 65 people who were reported to have visited Gul Plaza remain unaccounted for, raising fears that casualties could rise sharply.“I cannot give a final number as of yet,” he said. “There has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident.”South DIG Syed Asad Raza said more areas of the plaza were yet to be cleared, and warned the number of fatalities could increase as debris is removed.The Sindh government has announced Rs10 million (£28,000) in compensation for the family of each person killed. “There can be no price tag on a life,” the chief minister said, adding that the compensation process would begin immediately.He also confirmed that one firefighter was among those who lost their lives.The cause of the fire has not yet been confirmed. Officials initially suspect an electrical short circuit, though a forensic investigation has been ordered. Police said samples had been collected for DNA matching to help identify victims.Authorities revealed that although the plaza had 16 gates, only three exits were open at the time of the fire, raising serious questions over safety compliance.Karachi has witnessed repeated fatal fires, often linked to poor safety standards, illegal construction and inadequate fire prevention systems. A government audit in 2024 found that the vast majority of commercial buildings in the city lacked proper fire safety measures.","Blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.

Background of the cases

Reactions and political context





A Bangladesh court on Monday sentenced former prime minister Sheikh Hasina to a total of 10 years in prison in two separate corruption cases linked to alleged irregularities in the allocation of residential plots under the Purbachal New Town government project near Dhaka.According to news agency ANI, Dhaka Special Judge Court-4 handed Hasina five years’ imprisonment in each case, taking the total sentence to 10 years.The verdict was delivered by Judge Robiul Alam.In the same cases, Hasina’s niece Tulip Rizwana Siddiq, a British MP and daughter of Sheikh Rehana, was sentenced to two years in each case, totalling four years in prison.Another niece, Azmina Siddiq, and Hasina’s son Radwan Mujib Siddiq, also known as Bobby, were sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment each.The 79-year-old former premier was sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for allegedly using her official influence to allocate residential plots to others, including Tulip Siddiq, under the Rajuk New Town Project in Purbachal on the outskirts of the capital.The court pronounced the judgment at around 12.30 pm (local time).Apart from Hasina and her relatives, several others were also convicted. According to news agency PTI, those sentenced to five years’ imprisonment included a former junior housing minister, a former secretary of the housing ministry, a former Rajuk chairman and officials of the state-run Rajuk authority, which oversees plot allocations.Only one of the accused, a senior Rajuk official, was present in court, while the rest were tried in absentia.“The trial of the accused was not obstructed regardless of where they (accused) were in the world,” the judge said while delivering the verdict, as quoted by PTI.The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) filed the cases on January 13, 2025, initially against 16 individuals, later submitting charge sheets against 18 accused on March 10, 2025.A total of 31 witnesses testified during the trial, with the recording of testimonies concluding on January 5 this year. The court had fixed February 2 for pronouncing judgment in both cases.The corruption watchdog alleged Hasina colluded with government officials to illegally secure plots in the Purbachal New Town Project for herself and her family members, despite them being ineligible under existing rules.Hasina has earlier been convicted in multiple other cases related to the same project and sentenced to a cumulative 26 years in prison in previous verdicts.Hasina’s now-disbanded Awami League described the sentences as “entirely predictable” and alleged the cases were “fabricated” by the interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.Tulip Siddiq rejected the allegations, calling the process “flawed and farcical from the beginning to the end”. “I’m absolutely baffled by the whole thing,” she was quoted by the BBC as saying, adding that she had not received any summons or charge sheet.She said she had engaged lawyers in both the UK and Bangladesh.Sheikh Hasina has been living in exile in India since August 5, 2024, after her government was toppled in a student-led uprising.Following her ouster, an interim government under Muhammad Yunus initiated a series of legal proceedings against Hasina, her family members and former Awami League leaders.Earlier, a special tribunal sentenced Hasina to death on charges of committing crimes against humanity for her alleged role in brutally suppressing the student-led uprising.Separately, on an Anti-Corruption Commission complaint, a court on November 27 had sentenced Hasina to a total of 21 years’ imprisonment.","Sheikh Hasina sentenced to 10 years in prison in two separate corruption cases.

Pakistan and Bangladesh on Thursday resumed direct air connectivity after a 14-year suspension, marking a move towards improving bilateral ties as Biman Bangladesh Airlines operated its inaugural Dhaka–Karachi flight.The flight, BG341, landed at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport at 11.03 pm after departing Dhaka’s Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 8.15 pm, according to flight tracking data cited by Dawn. The aircraft received a traditional water cannon salute on arrival, the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) said in a statement .Speaking to reporters at the airport, Sindh governor Kamran Tessori said cooperation between the two countries would extend beyond aviation to other sectors.Earlier in the day, Pakistan’s high commission in Dhaka said the “fully packed” inaugural flight was seen off by Bangladesh’s civil aviation and tourism adviser Sheikh Bashiruddin, Pakistan high commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider, and other officials .Addressing the ceremony in Dhaka, Sheikh Bashiruddin said the Dhaka–Karachi route aimed at “enhancing connectivity, promoting tourism and strengthening people-to-people links”.He added, “Bangladesh Airlines will gradually increase flight frequency and reduce airfares to make travel more affordable for the people” .Pakistan’s high commissioner referred to discussions between Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus and prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on restoring air links.“In view of the vision of the leadership and aspirations of the people of our two countries… both sides agreed to take immediate measures for the resumption of direct flights,” he said, referring to talks held during deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar’s visit to Dhaka in August last year .Direct flights between the two countries had been suspended since 2012, forcing travellers to rely on connecting routes via Gulf hubs such as Dubai and Doha.

Awami League Escalates Bangladesh Crisis With ‘No Boat No Vote’ Boycott Call Against Yunus Polls





Bangladesh on Wednesday said that there was no security situation that justified India recalling the family members of its diplomats from Dhaka. This comes after New Delhi cited precautionary safety concerns amid rising extremist activity ahead of the country’s general elections.Bangladesh’s foreign affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said that there was “no reason” for such a move and maintained that foreign diplomats and their families were not facing any threat in the country.Addressing a media briefing at the foreign ministry, Hossain said, “There is no situation here that would indicate danger (for Indian diplomats).” He added that Bangladesh had not received any formal communication from India flagging specific security concerns.Calling the decision an internal matter of India, Hossain said, “It is entirely their internal matter. They (India) can ask their officials or families to leave at any time.” He added that Bangladesh had no objection if Indian diplomats chose to send their family members back. “If they want to do so, there is nothing we can do about it,” he said.Hossain, who has earlier served as Bangladesh’s deputy high commissioner in India, said he could not identify a clear reason behind the move.“Perhaps (India) they have some apprehension or want to convey a message, but I cannot identify any clear reason,” he said.India last week advised the families of its diplomats and officials posted in Bangladesh to return home, weeks before the February 12 elections, citing security concerns following increased activities of extremist elements.India has its High Commission in Dhaka and diplomatic posts in Khulna, Chattogram, Rajshahi and Sylhet.Despite the recall of family members, the five Indian diplomatic missions in Bangladesh continue to function normally. The Indian High Commission in Dhaka also hosted a reception to mark India’s Republic Day, officials said.Earlier, Indian government sources said the decision to advise dependents of mission and post officials to return to India was taken as a precautionary measure.“Given the security situation, as a precautionary measure, we have advised the dependents of mission and post officials to return to India. The mission and all posts in Bangladesh continue to remain open and operational,” an official source said, adding that the Indian mission was functioning at full strength.According to sources, the move followed recent anti-India protests that were feared could escalate. “It’s for the time being and will be reviewed later,” an official said on condition of anonymity.In India’s neighbourhood, Afghanistan remains the only posting where Indian officials are not accompanied by their families. While diplomats in Pakistan are technically allowed to take their families, they generally avoid doing so following past security advisories.","India last week advised the families of its diplomats and officials posted in Bangladesh to return home, weeks before the February 12 elections.

Ex-PM Hasina Calls Yunus “Murderous Fascist,” Warns Bangladesh at Edge of Abyss





A Bangladesh court on Monday sentenced Dhaka’s fugitive former police chief and two senior officers to death for crimes against humanity over the killing of six protesters during the July 2024 mass uprising that led to the overthrow of then prime minister Sheikh Hasina.The International Crimes Tribunal-1 (ICT-1) handed the death penalty to former Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) commissioner Habibur Rahman, former joint commissioner Sudip Kumar Chakrabort and former additional deputy commissioner (Ramna zone) Shah Alam Mohammad Akhtarul Islam. All three were tried in absentia and their whereabouts remain unknown, as reported by Dhaka Tribune.The verdict comes ahead of Bangladesh’s February 12 elections, the first polls since Hasina was ousted in August 2024 following weeks of mass protests.Five other former police officials were sentenced to varying prison terms. Former assistant commissioner of Ramna zone Mohammad Imrul was jailed for six years; former Shahbagh Police Station inspector (operations) Md Arshad Hossain received four years; while constables Md Sujan Mia, Md Imaz Hossain Emon and Md Nasirul Islam were sentenced to three years each. Arshad, Sujan, Imaz and Nasirul are currently in custody.The case relates to the killing of six protesters in Dhaka’s Chankharpul area on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fled to India as demonstrators stormed her official residence.The verdict was delivered by a three-member bench of ICT-1 comprising Justice Mozumder, Justice Md Shafiul Alam Mahmud and Judge Md Mohitul Hoque Anam Chowdhury.Reading out the verdict, tribunal chairman Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder said that the evidence proved that police opened fire with lethal weapons on protesters.“The police forces… opened fire with lethal weapons… causing death to the aforesaid six persons,” the judge told the court.The tribunal heard that Habibur Rahman sent messages to police units ordering them to use lethal force to crush the protests.Chief Prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam said that he was satisfied with the death sentences but expressed disappointment over the prison terms handed to the other five accused, according to the Dailystar.“The court said their crimes have been proved and they committed crimes against humanity,” Islam told reporters, adding that he would appeal for harsher punishment for those given jail terms.Families of the victims, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the judgment. Sanjida Khan, the mother of slain protester Shahriar Khan Anas, broke down inside the courtroom.“We can never be satisfied with this verdict. We did not get Insaaf (justice),” she said, questioning the prosecution over the sentences.Similarly, Shahid Ahmed, uncle of another victim, Md Yakub, said the lighter sentences posed a threat.“We wanted death sentence for all. Instead, some of them got three to four years’ imprisonment. After completing their terms, they will come out and might threaten us,” he said.This is the second verdict delivered by the tribunal over crimes against humanity committed during the July uprising.In November last year, the same court sentenced Sheikh Hasina and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal to death in absentia in a separate case.Former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, who confessed and turned state witness, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment in that case.The Chankharpul investigation report was submitted on April 21, 2025, the first filed before the reconstituted tribunal with formal charges framed on July 14.After examining 26 witnesses over 23 working days, the tribunal concluded that the police firing was carried out on direct orders from senior officials, warranting the maximum punishment.","The International Crimes Tribunal-1 handed the death penalty to former Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) commissioner Habibur Rahman, former joint commissioner Sudip Kumar Chakrabort and former additional deputy commissioner Shah Alam Mohammad Akhtarul Islam.

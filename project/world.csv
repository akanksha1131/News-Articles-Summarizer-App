"'4% approval rating': Trump mocks Zelenskyy, advises Ukraine to hold elections before peace talks with Russia",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/4-approval-rating-trump-mocks-zelenskyy-advises-ukraine-to-hold-elections-before-peace-talks-with-russia/articleshow/118371902.cms,"US President Donald Trump on Tuesday advised Ukraine to hold its elections to potentially remove Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Trump claimed that Zelenskyy “4% approval rating” — despite polls showing the Ukrainian president hovering just above 50%.“We have a situation where we haven’t had elections in Ukraine, where we have martial law, essentially martial law in Ukraine,” Trump said at a press conference at Mar-a-Lago after his US delegation finished talks with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia.“That’s not a Russia thing,” Trump said of wanting elections in Ukraine. “That’s something coming from me and coming from many other countries also, you know, Ukraine is being just wiped out.”Presidential elections in Ukraine were scheduled for April 2024, but were not held following martial law in the country after Russia launched the largest invasion since World War II in February of 2022.Zelenskyy, in 2023, claimed that an election would further lead to a political divide at a time when the country should be focused on defense.Trump's remarks on Zelenskyy came as the US delegation met Russian officials to push for peace talks in a four-and-a-half hour meeting in the Saudi Arabia.Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said that the he was ""surprised"" that no Ukrainians were invited despite suffering through a nearly three-year-long war with Russia.“I would say that, you know, when they want a seat at the table, you could say the people have to, wouldn’t the people of Ukraine have to say, like, you know, it’s been a long time since we’ve had an election,” Trump responded to Ukraine.Earlier, Zelenskyy had blasted Russia for wanting to impose e new elections in Ukraine as a part of a potential peace plan and said that he would not settle for “ultimatums” from Russian President Vladimir Putin.Last week, Trump had a telephonic exchange with Russian President Putin.Following the exchange, Trump said he “likes” Zelensky “personally,” but he doesn’t “care about personally.”“I care about getting the job done. You have leadership now that’s allowed a war to go on that should have never even happened,” Trump said, never mentioning Russia’s role in launching the invasion.Trump also criticised Zelenskyy for misplacing funds the US has been giving Ukraine throughout the war.“Where is all the money that’s been given? Where is it going? And nobody, I’ve never seen an accounting of it. We give hundreds of billions of dollars. I don’t see any accounting. So I want to see peace,” Trump said.Trump also claimed Ukraine was the country that “started” the war with Russia, despite Moscow launching missiles into Ukraine.","US President Donald Trump advised Ukraine to hold its elections to potentially remove Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

ASMR: Watch: White House shares ‘ASMR’ video of deportation flight; shows deportees being chained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-white-house-shares-asmr-video-of-deportation-flight-shows-deportees-being-chained/articleshow/118371634.cms,"What is ASMR?

The White House on Tuesday shared a video titled "" ASMR : Illegal Alien Deportation Flight"" showing immigrants in shackles boarding a deportation flight. According to CNBC News, the flight departed from Seattle.The post shared on X features various clips of officers preparing restraints, chaining deportees, detainees walking in chains, and individuals boarding a plane.The White House’s use of the term ASMR in this context drew reactions online, including from billionaire Elon Musk , who responded with: “Haha wow.”The 40-second video includes close-up shots of handcuffs being laid out, officers securing restraints, and detainees walking up steel steps to the aircraft. None of the individuals’ faces are visible. The video was originally posted by the Seattle office of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with the caption: ""REMOVAL FLIGHT. A group of undocumented aliens are flown from Seattle as part of a process to finalize return to their home countries,"" CNBC reports.Other X users also reacted to the video, with one calling its posting on the White House's official account ""based."" Another questioned, ""How much did this security theatre cost the American taxpayer?"" A third user expressed surprise, saying, ""I never thought I would hear an ASMR video of deportation.""ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, is a relaxing, tingling sensation that some people experience in response to specific sounds or visual triggers. Common ASMR triggers include soft whispering, tapping, crinkling paper, brushing sounds, and even gentle hand movements. Many people watch ASMR videos to help with relaxation, sleep, or stress relief. The sensation can create a calming effect similar to a light massage or a soothing lullaby.The White House's decision to label its deportation video as ASMR suggests that, for some, the sights and sounds of shackles and chains might evoke a similar reaction.Since taking office on January 20, President Donald Trump has increased deportations as part of his immigration policy. Thousands of undocumented immigrants have already been sent back, including over 300 Indian nationals.Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, has said the administration will continue deportations, stating that he will not rest until every “illegal criminal migrant” is “eradicated” from the country. He also noted that illegal crossings have decreased under Trump compared to the previous administration.","The White House on Tuesday shared a video titled "" ASMR : Illegal Alien Deportation Flight"" The 40-second video includes close-up shots of handcuffs being laid out, officers securing restraints, and detainees walking up steel steps to the aircraft.

Barron Trump: NYU college Republicans president resigns after ‘oddity on campus’ remark about Barron Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nyu-college-republicans-president-resigns-after-oddity-on-campus-remark-about-barron-trump/articleshow/118371209.cms,"The president of New York University ’s College Republicans resigned on Monday following backlash over her remarks about Barron Trump , the 18-year-old son of US President Donald Trump , New York Post reports.Kaya Walker stepped down after calling Barron “sort of like an oddity on campus” in an interview with Vanity Fair last week. She described his routine as, “He goes to class, he goes home,” and recalled a professor joking that Barron “doesn’t really belong here.”Her comments stirred a row, with the national College Republicans of America (CRA) criticising them as “inappropriate” and not reflective of the organisation’s values.In the wake of the controversy, CRA President Will Donahue invited Barron to join their ranks, saying, “Barron Trump represents the future of the conservative movement, and we would be honoured to have him join College Republicans of America.” He added, “Strong leadership is built on resilience, courage, and the humility to rise above petty hostility—qualities that Barron has already demonstrated.”Barron’s presence at NYU has drawn attention since he enrolled at the Stern School of Business last autumn. Despite being the son of a US president, he has remained mostly private, largely due to the Secret Service officers who accompany him.His commute from Trump Tower to campus in black SUVs has sparked curiosity, but he is rarely seen outside class. Unlike past celebrity students like Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen or Dylan Sprouse, Barron keeps a low profile.Some students have tried to interact with him. One recalled asking him to play basketball, saying Barron seemed interested but suggested he “wasn’t really allowed to do stuff.” Meanwhile, his movements have occasionally been shared online, with one student posting a picture of him in class and writing, “Today was wild.”According to reports, the 6'7"" Barron has been described as a “ladies’ man” by many, while others say he prefers video games and quiet hobbies. His brother, Eric Trump, once called him “the most eligible bachelor in the world.” Conservative commentators like Benny Johnson have referred to the study on him as “what real rizz is.”Walker’s resignation has put more focus on Barron’s role in conservative circles. He has not made a public statement or joined social media, but some view him as an emerging figure in the movement. With CRA backing Donald Trump before the Republican primaries and now inviting Barron, the group seems eager to bring him in.","Kaya Walker stepped down after calling Barron “sort of like an oddity on campus” Her comments stirred a row, with the national College Republicans of America criticising them as “inappropriate” and not reflective of the organisation’s values.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118371308,imgsize-1545320,width-400,resizemode-4/118371308.jpg"

Germany elections 2025: Who are the top candidates for German chancellor race?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/germany-elections-2025-who-are-the-top-candidates-for-german-chancellor-race/articleshow/118333480.cms,"Who are the top candidates?



Friedrich Merz (CDU) – The Frontrunner:

Olaf Scholz (SPD) – The Incumbent Chancellor:

Alice Weidel (AfD) :

Robert Habeck (The Greens):

Sahra Wagenknecht

(BSW) :

Christian Lindner

(FDP):

Heidi Reichinnek and Jan van Aken (The Left ):

German voters will choose their next government on 23 February, with key issues such as immigration control and reviving the EU’s largest economy taking center stage in the snap election.The upcoming election, originally scheduled for 28 September 2025, has been dramatically brought forward following the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz 's center-left coalition government late last year.The upcoming election unfolds during a period when Germany confronts several critical issues, including its declining economy, debates over immigration policies, the growing influence of the far-right AfD (Alternative for Germany) party, and public concerns following violent incidents in Mannheim, Solingen, Magdeburg, and Aschaffenburg.Meanwhile, Germany’s economic outlook remains bleak, with the country experiencing two consecutive years of decline for the first time in decades. High energy costs, excessive bureaucracy, and stiff competition from China have weakened its industrial base, particularly the once-dominant automotive sector, which is struggling to adapt to the demand for electric vehicles, according to BBC.As the election approaches in a week, polls indicate the conservative parties are ahead - with Friedrich Merz 's CDU commanding approximately 30% support whilst Alice Weidel 's AfD holds about 20% of voter intentions.The current Chancellor Olaf Scholz's SPD trails in third position at 15% in the polls, followed by coalition partner Robert Habeck 's Green Party securing just above 13% of projected votes.Friedrich Merz, leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), is the frontrunner in the German election, with polls showing his party leading at 30%. A pro-business, social conservative, Merz has long been a rival to former chancellor Angela Merkel and is running under the slogan ""A Germany we can be proud of again.""His key policies focus on cutting taxes, slashing welfare spending by €50 billion, and implementing permanent border controls with stricter asylum rules to curb immigration.Merz also supports boosting Germany’s defence spending, maintaining at least 2% of GDP for military purposes, and potentially introducing compulsory military service. He advocates stronger European leadership and unwavering support for Ukraine, refusing to rule out its future NATO membership.However, Merz has faced controversy over his party’s immigration stance, particularly after he sought to pass stricter asylum policies with the support of far-right AfD votes, despite publicly ruling out cooperation with them.Olaf Scholz, the current chancellor and leader of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), has seen his party’s support decline to 15%, placing third in the polls. His government has struggled due to the economic effects of Russia’s war on Ukraine and disputes over Germany’s debt rules.Despite internal opposition, Scholz has pledged continued military aid for Ukraine but has faced criticism for being too slow in providing support. His economic agenda includes raising the minimum wage to €15 per hour, lowering income tax for most households, and creating a €100 billion investment fund to boost public infrastructure and green energy.While supporting faster deportations for rejected asylum seekers, Scholz also backs maintaining dual citizenship and streamlined immigration for skilled workers. Despite internal party dissatisfaction, Scholz remains the SPD’s candidate, though some members had preferred Defence Minister Boris Pistorius to run instead.Alice Weidel, leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), has surged in popularity, with her party polling at 20%, placing second.Known for her hardline stance on immigration, Weidel supports mass deportations under “remigration” policies, the closure of Germany’s land borders, and the elimination of EU-wide asylum rules.She has advocated for lower taxes, drastic reductions in bureaucracy, and strict adherence to Germany’s constitutional debt brake but has not outlined clear plans on how to fund these policies.Weidel has gained popularity among young voters on social media and has received endorsement from billionaire Elon Musk, but her party remains isolated from mainstream political coalitions.Robert Habeck, co-leader of The Greens, is currently polling between third and fourth place, tied with the SPD. His party advocates for a green economic transition, proposing a publicly funded investment plan to modernize Germany’s infrastructure while reforming the debt brake to allow more spending.Although previously strong on climate policies, The Greens have softened their stance, now pushing for cheaper energy solutions such as overhead power lines instead of expensive underground cables.Habeck supports keeping Germany’s defence spending at 2% of GDP, deeper EU integration, and stronger arms cooperation across Europe. His party has backed continued support for Ukraine, including NATO membership, and opposes the outsourcing of asylum processes to third countries. However, Habeck’s controversial heating policy reforms led to a drop in his party’s approval ratings, weakening their standing ahead of the election.Sahra Wagenknecht, leader of the newly formed BSW party, has positioned herself as an alternative to both the far-right AfD and mainstream left-wing politics, polling between 4% and 6%.She brands her ideology as “left conservatism,” supporting tough immigration restrictions, opposing German military aid to Ukraine, and advocating for closer economic ties with Russia. Wagenknecht calls for lower energy prices, the repeal of heating regulations, and higher minimum wages, while maintaining strong public welfare programs.However, her pro-Russian stance and skepticism of climate policies have made her a controversial figure, and she risks failing to reach the 5% threshold required to enter parliament.Following a contentious budget disagreement, Scholz dismissed his Finance Minister Christian Lindner, leading to the ruling coalition's breakdown.

Subsequently, this has triggered massive demonstrations across various cities, drawing hundreds of thousands of participants.","German voters will choose their next government on 23 February, with key issues such as immigration control and reviving the EU’s largest economy taking center stage in the snap election.

As the election approaches in a week, polls indicate the conservative parties are ahead - with Friedrich Merz's CDU commanding approximately 30% support.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118333856,imgsize-820509,width-400,resizemode-4/118333856.jpg"

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday asked the purpose behind providing $21 million to India for ""voter turnout"" and said that the country is ""one of the highest taxing countries in the world"". This came after Elon Musk-led DOGE’s (Department of Government Efficiency) disclosed that USAID contributed $21 million to EC allegedly for boosting voter turnout.""Why are we giving $21 million to India? They have a lot more money. They are one of the highest taxing countries in the world in terms of us; we can hardly get in there because their tariffs are so high,"" he asked while signing executive orders at Mar-a-Lago.Categorically mentioning that he had ""a lot of respect"" for PM Narendra Modi, Trump questioned the funding. ""I have a lot of respect for India and their prime minister, but giving $21 million for voter turnout?"" he said. The two leaders recently held bilateral talks where they discussed trade, illegal immigration, defence and energy, among other key sectors.The Musk-led department had last week shared a list of areas from where it had decided to revoke the US aid. One of those included -- ""$21M for voter turnout in India"" -- prompting political slugfest between the BJP and the Congress in the country.The BJP has renewed its call for an investigation into the matter. Meanwhile, former CEC SY Quraishi clarified that while the Election Commission had an understanding with USAID, no financial assistance was involved.“So, DOGE has discovered that USAID allocated $21 million for ‘voter turnout’ in India, a euphemism for paying voters to cast their votes to effect regime change. Veena Reddy was sent to India in 2021 (ominous?) as head of USAID’s Indian mission. Post Lok Sabha elections 2024 (presumably her voter turnout mission done), she returned to US. Pity because investigating agencies here could have asked her some questions about who this money was given to for applying it to voter turnout operations,” BJP MP Mahesh Jethmalani said.The Congress party has also condemned foreign interference in India's electoral process, urging the Modi government to probe USAID’s claims and take action if any wrongdoing is uncovered.","US President Donald Trump asked the purpose behind providing $21 million to India for ""voter turnout"" He said that the country is ""one of the highest taxing countries in the world"" The BJP has renewed its call for an investigation into the matter.

Mass layoffs and buyout scheme

A federal judge rejected an emergency request on Tuesday to stop billionaire Elon Musk and his department of government efficiency ( DOGE ) from firing federal employees and accessing agency data.This move bolstered US President Donald Trump’s plan to cut government spending, as he called for large-scale reductions across several departments and agencies. Thousands have already lost their jobs, while many more await dismissal.Fourteen Democrat-led states sued last week, challenging Musk’s authority. But on Tuesday, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled they had not proven immediate or irreversible harm, saying this was not enough to justify blocking his actions.""Plaintiffs have not carried their burden of showing that they will suffer imminent, irreparable harm absent a temporary restraining order,"" Chutkan said.Chutkan is an appointee of former US President Barack Obama. She previously oversaw the now-abandoned criminal case against Trump for allegedly conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.DOGE is an independent agency led by Musk and aims to reduce government spending by cutting jobs and eliminating agencies. While Trump has maintained that agency heads are making the layoffs , critics argue that Musk wields too much power over federal operations.The 14 states claimed in their lawsuit that Musk had not been officially nominated or confirmed for a government position, yet was making key decisions on government contracts, expenditures, and staffing. They also raised concerns about DOGE gaining access to sensitive data from departments including education, labour, health and human services, energy, and transportation.Despite these concerns, Chutkan dismissed the request for a temporary restraining order. She said that uncertainty over DOGE’s actions was not enough to justify immediate court intervention. “The court is aware that DOGE’s unpredictable actions have resulted in considerable uncertainty and confusion for Plaintiffs and many of their agencies and residents. But the ‘possibility’ that Defendants may take actions that irreparably harm Plaintiffs ‘is not enough,’” she ruled.Musk’s cost-cutting measures have already led to major disruptions, with thousands of federal employees sent home as agencies face closures. A separate legal challenge sought to block a mass buyout scheme that offered federal employees eight months’ pay if they voluntarily resigned. In an email titled ""Fork in the Road,"" more than two million government workers were warned they could either accept the buyout or risk being fired in future layoffs.The White House said over 75,000 employees have already taken the offer, but unions representing government workers have fought to block the initiative. Last week, another federal judge lifted a temporary freeze on the buyout plan, allowing it to continue.Trump’s sweeping government overhaul has faced multiple court battles, with the White House accusing “judges in liberal districts” of attempting to block the administration’s reforms. However, rulings on these cases have come from judges appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents, including Trump himself.","US District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected an emergency request on Tuesday to stop billionaire Elon Musk and his department of government efficiency ( DOGE ) from firing federal employees.

The exchange resulted in injuries to Maland, Youngblut and Baukholt. According to CBS News Minnesota, Baukholt died at the scene, while Maland succumbed to his injuries at hospital.The firearm used in Vermont has been linked to the December 31, 2022, deaths of Richard and Rita Zajko in Pennsylvania.

ISLAMABAD: At least 10 people were killed and six injured a bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by in Harnai district of southwestern Balochistan province on Friday, officials said.Hazrat Wali Kakar, Harnai’s top civilian official, said the bomb was an improvised explosive device (IED). “Ten mining workers were killed in the attack,” Kakar said.Saleem Tareen, another local official, said most of the victims were from the country’s northwestern Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province. “The labourers were traveling to a market in Harnai,” he added. Harnai lies some 160 km east of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province.Authorities said they were investigating the attack, with officials saying evidence was being collected and that preliminary investigation showed the explosive material had been planted on the roadside.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. But the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organisation fighting for independence, is active in the restive province that borders Afghanistan and Iran. The group usually targets security forces as well as Pakistanis from other provinces. Local media reported that most of the workers killed or injured came from KP’s Puran village.The BLA has also targeted Chinese projects in the region, arguing that foreigners are exploiting resource-rich Balochistan while the impoverished residents are left behind.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif responded to the incident by reaffirming his commitment to aggressively working to eradicate terrorism in the country.",A bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by.

Such steps accentuate military imbalances in the region and undermine strategic stability. They remain unhelpful in achieving durable peace in South Asia,” Khan said.“We urge our international partners to take a holistic and objective view of issues of peace and security in South Asia and refrain from endorsing positions that are one-sided and divorced from ground realities,” he said.","The joint India-US statement called on Islamabad to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attack and the Pathankot attack. “We consider the Pakistan-specific reference in the Indo-US joint statement on February 13, 2025 as one-sided, misleading and contrary to diplomatic norms,” foreign office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118257401,imgsize-34754,width-400,resizemode-4/118257401.jpg"

Before that, at least 300 Pakistanis had drowned in a migrant boat that sank off Greece in June 2023, with Italy their intended destination.In a travel alert, Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has identified Libya as one of 15 transit countries used for human trafficking.Each year, thousands of Pakistanis pay traffickers large sums for risky and illegal journeys to Europe, hoping to find work and send money back to their families. Many also take these perilous routes to escape conflicts and religious persecution.Pakistani authorities claim human smugglers send migrants seeking illegal entry into Europe to Libya, located around 300km from Italy. From there, they either take them by boat to Europe or relocate them to the coastal cities of Morocco and Mauritania in west Africa.On Monday, UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it was “deeply alarmed” by the dozens of migrants’ bodies found in mass graves in southeastern Libya.

An estimated 65 people were on the boat, it said.Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his deep grief and sorrow for those lost in the capsizing in Marsa Dela port in the western city of Zawiya.Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to complete the process of identifying the victims and provide assistance to those affected. He also ordered action against those involved ""in heinous acts like human trafficking,"" according to a statement.Most of the victims came from Kurram, a district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan , where hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in sectarian clashes.""People try to travel to Europe through illegal means because of unemployment"" at home, said Javed Hussain, a nephew of Shehzad Hussain, one of the victims.

Some of the survivors later accused smugglers of killing 43 migrants in a dispute over payment. Pakistan has since confirmed the deaths of 13 of its nationals.Hundreds of Pakistanis die every year while trying to reach Europe by land and sea with the help of human smugglers. They also use dangerous land and sea routes to reach Europe in an effort to find jobs.Libya, which has borders with six nations and a long shore on the Mediterranean, was plunged into chaos following a Nato-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.

More than 21,700 migrants were intercepted and returned to the chaos-stricken country.In 2023, the IOM reported 962 migrants dead and 1,563 missing off Libya. Around 17,200 migrants were intercepted and returned to Libya that year, it said.Those who are returned are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture - practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to UN-commissioned investigators.

Corruption Perceptions Index: Pakistan's ranking on corruption index drops by 2 spots: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-ranking-on-corruption-index-drops-by-2-spots-report/articleshow/118143601.cms,"Pakistan's flag

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024 out of 180 countries, a media report said on Tuesday. The CPI ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption on a scale of zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean), Dawn.com reported.The CPI report is released annually by Transparency International Berlin.Transparency International Pakistan (TIP) has no role either in the collection of data or the calculation of the country's score, TIP explains.The score for Pakistan also reduced by two points from 29 in CPI 2023 to 27 in CPI 2024.According to a Transparency International document listing Pakistan's CPI ranking and scores from 1996 to 2024, which was seen by Dawn.com, the country's score in the past 10 years has ranged between 27 and 33 points (a higher score indicating less corruption).Since 2012, when the index changed to a scoring scale of 100 from 10, Pakistan's score rose from 27 to 33 in 2018 but declined consecutively back to 27 last year.Statistics from the past show that in 1996, Pakistan ranked only second-last out of 54 countries part of the index back then, with a score of 1/10.From 1997 to 2011, the country's score went back and forth, reaching as high as 2.7 in 1998 and dropping as low as 2.1 in 2004 and 2005.According to TIP chair Justice (retired) Zia Perwez, the scores of all countries in the region except Oman, China, Turkiye and Mongolia declined. The downslide for the region showed that Pakistan was one of the countries holding up against the overall trend in the region.Global corruption levels remained alarmingly high, with efforts to reduce them faltering, according to the CPI report, which exposed serious corruption levels across the globe, with more than two-thirds of countries scoring below 50 out of 100.Almost 6.8 billion people live in countries with CPI scores under 50 - equivalent to 85 per cent of the world population of 8 billion.For the seventh year in a row, Denmark obtained the highest score on the index (90) and was closely followed by Finland (88) and Singapore (84).Countries with the lowest scores were mostly fragile and conflict-affected ones like South Sudan (8), Somalia (9), Venezuela (10), Syria (12), Libya (13), Eritrea (13), Yemen (13) and Equatorial Guinea (13).While the CPI noted that the Middle East and North Africa's rising average score was a ""reason for optimism"", it pointed out that it was the first increase in over a decade and only by one point - to 39 out of 100.According to Transparency International, the top-scoring region was Western Europe and the European Union, but its score ""decreased overall for the second year in a row - many leaders are serving business interests rather than the common good and laws are often poorly enforced"".""While Asia Pacific does have a range of improving countries, its average score is decreasing, as vicious cycles of corruption and climate change impacts take their toll,"" it added.Over a quarter of the countries in the sample (47) got their lowest score yet on the index, including Austria (67), Bangladesh (23), Brazil (34), Cuba (41), France (67), Germany (75), Haiti (16), Hungary (41), Iran (23), Mexico (26), Russia (22), South Sudan (8), Switzerland (81), the United States (65) and Venezuela (10).Over the past five years, seven countries have significantly improved their scores in the index: These include Cote d'Ivoire (45), the Dominican Republic (36), Kosovo (44), Kuwait (46), the Maldives (38), Moldova (43) and Zambia (39).The global average on the index remained unchanged at 43, highlighting the need for urgent action against corruption and warning of a critical global obstacle to implementing successful climate action.",Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024.

ISLAMABAD: Hundreds of lawyers on Monday staged protests in Pakistan's national capital against a high-level meeting of a constitutional body with the agenda to appoint at least eight judges of the supreme court. The judicial commission of Pakistan (JCP) meeting was being held despite opposition by four apex court judges, the legal fraternity, resistance by opposition the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and controversy over the recent transfer of judges to the Islamabad high court (IHC), which was opposed by five IHC judges.The JCP, a top body empowered to approve judicial appointments, will finalise appointments for eight vacant supreme court judges.Lawyers gathered at various locations in Islamabad, with the lawyers' action committee staging a protest near D-Chowk. But police responded by closing several key entry points to the Red Zone, which houses key buildings, including the supreme court.Dozens of protestors gathered at Serena Chowk as they were stopped from going to the supreme court due to the closure of the Red Zone. They chanted ""Azaadi"" (freedom) and ""Lawyers' unity zindabad"" (long live lawyers' unity). They were also holding a banner written in Urdu and reading "" 26th constitutional amendment unacceptable"".Clashes were also reported between lawyers and police when they tried to enter the Red Zone. However, there was no report of any arrest or injury during the protest.The protest led to the suspension of metro bus services on multiple routes between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, causing significant inconvenience for commuters. The closure of the Red Zone has caused traffic disruptions, leading to heavy congestion on different roads in the capital.Earlier, the legal fraternity in the country was already expressing concerns against the new appointments and transfers following the controversial 26th constitutional amendment passed last year.The lawyers' representatives had held a convention at the Islamabad district courts, opposing the 26th amendment and demanding the cancellation of the JCP meeting.They also announced on February 3 to protest against the transfer of three high court judges to the IHC but it could not elicit a widespread response. The Karachi bar association had supported the strike call by staying away.Last month, the Lahore high court bar association (LHCBA) moved an application before the apex court through advocate Muhammad Waqar Rana, seeking postponement of the JCP meeting.The JCP earlier this month asked all high courts to send a list of five senior judges from each for consideration for the appointment of eight of them to the supreme court.Initially, the IHC had forwarded the names of three judges - chief justice Aamer Farooq, justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb - to the JCP because justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar did not meet the minimum requirement of five years of service.However, as justice Sarfraz Dogar was made the IHC senior puisne judge following his transfer there from the Lahore high court, his name has also been sent to the JCP.Days before justice Dogar's name was added, five judges of the IHC approached chief justice Yahya Afridi and IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq to reclaim their seniority.Separately, four SC judges, senior puisne judge justice Mansoor Ali Shah, justice Munib Akhtar, justice Ayesha Malik and justice Athar Minallah, in a letter to the chief justice showed concerns last week and are also seeking the postponement of today's JCP session until a decision is made on the petitions against the 26th Amendment.The opposition PTI party in a letter to the chief justice on Sunday asked to postpone the commission's meeting.The 13-member JCP is led by the chief justice and includes four judges of the apex court, as well as parliamentarians from both the treasury and opposition and others.The lawyers and opposition allege that the government was trying to 'pack' the top judiciary with hand-picked judges to influence the fate of political cases, a concern rejected by the government.","Hundreds of lawyers stage protests in Islamabad against high-level meeting of constitutional body.

Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

DHAKA: Police in Bangladesh have arrested 41 former officers who are among 1,059 ex-policemen accused of committing atrocities during the 2024 student-led movement that led to the ouster of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, officials and media reports said on Monday.Hasina, the Awami League leader, resigned and escaped to India on August 5 last year after anti-discrimination student protests against the quota system turned into a movement and ousted her 16-year regime from power. Some 1,400 people lost their lives during the protests between July and August.The mass circulation Prothom Alo newspaper, quoting unnamed police headquarters (PHQ) officials, said surviving victims of the atrocities or the family members of the slain victims lodged hundreds of cases with police stations and court accusing the 1,059 officials of the main law enforcement agency.Police have arrested 41 former officers so far.The PHQ said police's two former inspectors general (IGP) Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun and AKN Shahidul Haque and former police commissioners of Dhaka and the southeastern port city of Chattogram Mohammad Asaduzzaan and Mian Saiful Islam were among those who were arrested so far.Other than Haq, these officers were serving until Hasina departed from the country.The highest number of 174 cases were filed against Dhaka Metropolitan Police 's now fugitive former additional commissioner Harunur Rashid.Arrested former IGP Al Mamun faces 159 cases.The officials said several senior officers including additional police chiefs and a police commissioner were on the run while some of them were believed to have fled the country.Bangladesh is currently governed by an interim government led by Muhammad Yunus, whom the anti-discrimination students movement appointed as chief advisor.Incumbent inspector general of police Baharul Alam earlier said the cases filed over the July-August uprising would be investigated under committees led by senior police officers in each of eight police ranges across Bangladesh.The UN rights office which last week released a fact-finding report on the 2024 violence in Bangladesh reviewed the police and other security forces' role, saying they used force causing ""systematic and widespread extrajudicial killings as part of a coordinated strategy of repression"".The office of the high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) said the vast majority of the people killed in violence during the uprising were shot by Bangladesh's security forces.""Based on the material before it, OHCHR has reasonable grounds to believe that police and paramilitary state security forces resorted to use of force violations against protesters, including systematic and widespread extrajudicial killings as part of a coordinated strategy of repression,"" it read.It said the security forces tried to disperse disruptive ""yet peaceful assemblies with 'disproportionate force', in particular by shooting military rifles and shotguns loaded with lethal metal pellets"" while in some cases ""deliberately killed or maimed defenceless protesters by shooting them at point-blank range"".","Police in Bangladesh have arrested 41 former officers who are among 1,059 ex- policemen.

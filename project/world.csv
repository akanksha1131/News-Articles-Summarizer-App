"Cuba Earthquakes: Twin earthquakes shake Cuba in wake of recent hurricanes, blackouts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/twin-earthquakes-shake-cuba-in-wake-of-recent-hurricanes-blackouts/articleshow/115158404.cms,"People recover belongings from their houses, which were destroyed by Hurricane Rafael, in Alquizar, Cuba.

Southern Cuba was struck by two powerful earthquakes on Sunday, just days after the island was battered by Hurricane Rafael and Oscar.According to the US Geological Survey, the first tremor, measuring 5.9 magnitude, occurred at around 11 am (local time) off the coast of Bartolome Maso in Granma province. An hour later, a more intense 6.8 magnitude quake hit the same area at a depth of 14.6 miles.The quakes caused widespread panic, with residents rushing into the streets in fear, especially after enduring severe weather conditions earlier in the week.Despite the severe impact, the US Tsunami Warning System confirmed that there was no tsunami threat from the earthquakes.The earthquakes damaged homes and infrastructure, particularly in eastern and central Cuba. State media reported cracked walls, collapsed roofs, and damaged power lines in towns like Bayamo, Santiago de Cuba, and Caney de las Mercedes.According to the news agency AFP, no fatalities have been reported so far despite the damage.The quakes have compounded the difficulties for many residents who are already facing hours-long power cuts and a severe economic crisis marked by soaring inflation and shortages of basic goods.Residents of Bayamo, a city with a population of around 140,000, described the intense shaking, with street poles swaying and homes rattling. In Santiago de Cuba, the island's second-largest city, buildings trembled, and people scrambled to safety.Livan Chavez, a welder from Bayamo, told AFP, ""People got scared. Everyone came running out of the houses very scared."" Another resident, Karen Rodriguez, noted that some homes in her small town had walls and roofs collapse.These tremors come as Cuba struggles to recover from a series of natural and man-made disasters. The island was recently hit by Hurricane Oscar , which caused widespread damage, and Hurricane Rafael, which knocked out the national power grid, leaving millions without electricity.The ongoing crisis has sparked rare protests, leading to the arrest of several individuals, as residents voiced their frustration over the prolonged blackouts and worsening living conditions.Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel addressed the nation via social media, acknowledging the damage and promising that efforts to assess and repair the destruction were underway. He emphasised that the government's priority is to ""save lives"" amidst these overlapping crises.The region around Santiago de Cuba is no stranger to seismic activity, as it sits near the fault line separating the North American and Caribbean plates. Local experts reported that over 15 aftershocks were felt following the initial quakes, prompting authorities to warn residents to stay alert for further tremors.The dual disasters of hurricanes and earthquakes have left much of Cuba’s eastern region in dire need of aid and recovery efforts.","Southern Cuba was struck by two powerful earthquakes on Sunday.

Trump pressures candidates for Senate GOP leader to allow ‘recess appointments’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-pressures-candidates-for-senate-gop-leader-to-allow-recess-appointments/articleshow/115157523.cms,"President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday urged that the next Senate Republican leaders to back the use of "" recess appointments ,"" which would grant him the authority to make temporary appointments without requiring Senate vote.“Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner. Sometimes the votes can take two years, or more. This is what they did four years ago, and we cannot let it happen again. We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!” Trump posted on X.“Additionally, no Judges should be approved during this period of time because the Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. THANK YOU!” he added.The secret ballot contest features Republican Senators John Thune (South Dakota), John Cornyn (Texas) and Rick Scott (Florida), who are competing to succeed long-serving GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who is departing after nearly 20 years.The three candidates have sought Trump's backing, each attempting to demonstrate their allegiance to the president-elect whilst campaigning for the majority leader position.Since a 2014 Supreme Court decision restricted presidential authority for recess appointments, the Senate has prevented such actions. The chamber maintains brief ""pro-forma"" sessions during extended breaks exceeding 10 days to prevent unconfirmed appointments during Senate absences.With Trump’s approval crucial to the race, each of the three candidates promptly indicated openness to revisiting the practice. Scott responded to Trump, stating, “I 100% agree. I’ll do whatever it takes to expedite your nominations.”Thune issued a statement emphasising the need for swift action regarding nominees, indicating that ""all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments.""Cornyn said: ""It is unacceptable for Senate Ds to blockade President @realDonaldTrump 's cabinet appointments. If they do, we will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent."" He referenced the constitutional provision for recess appointments, Associated Press reported.This social media interaction served as an initial assessment for the candidates following Trump's decisive re-election the previous week.Trump's initial term was marked by tensions with Congress, particularly regarding the Senate's constitutional role in confirming nominations. Following his substantial electoral victory, he has begun indicating clear expectations for Senate Republicans and their future leader regarding his Cabinet choices.Trump additionally posted about preventing judicial approvals before the Republican takeover, though this presents challenges as Democrats maintain control until January 3.The leadership contest remains uncertain with Thune and Cornyn, both former McConnell deputies, considered leading candidates despite previous Trump criticisms. Scott, though initially considered unlikely, has launched an energetic campaign seeking Trump's support.Scott has received endorsements from Trump-aligned senators Lee and Rubio, alongside Elon Musk. During his Fox News appearance, Scott said, ""We have to be the change. That's what Donald Trump got elected to do, to be the change.""The candidates have committed to greater transparency than McConnell offered, promising increased senatorial influence. They've distanced themselves from McConnell's relationship with Trump, noting McConnell's private criticism of the former president.Regarding Cabinet appointments, Trump's supporters continue their advocacy. Vivek Ramaswamy mentioned on ABC's ""This Week"" about ""a couple of great options on the table.""Former ambassador Hagerty, who supports Scott, expressed on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" his pride in representing Trump's administration, stating, ""I'll do that in whatever role necessary.”",President-elect Donald Trump urged the next Senate Republican leaders to back the use of recess appointments. The practice would grant him the authority to make temporary appointments without requiring Senate vote.

WASHINGTON: In Dec last year, Donald Trump stated he wouldn’t be a dictator — “except for Day 1”. According to his own words, he’s got a lot to do on that first day in the White House. “I want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill,” he said. A look at what he has said he will do in his second term:Trump has said “within two seconds” of taking office that he would fire the special counsel who has been prosecuting two federal cases against him. Trump can’t pardon himself when it comes to his state conviction in New York in a hush money case, but he could seek to leverage his status to expunge his felony conviction. A case in Georgia, on poll interference, will likely be the only case left. It would probably be put on hold until 2029.Last month, Trump said: “On Day 1, I will launch the largest deportation programme in American history to get the criminals out.” He can begin the effort the minute he arrives in office, but it’s much more complicated to deport the nearly 11 million people who are believed to be in the US illegally. That would require a huge law enforcement force, massive detention facilities, airplanes to move people and nations willing to accept them.Over 1,500 people have been charged since a mob of Trump supporters attacked the Capitol in 2021. Trump has called the rioters “unbelievable patriots”. As prez, he can pardon anyone convicted and stop prosecution.Trump could begin the process of stripping career employees of their civil service protections, so they could be more easily fired. He wants to “totally obliterate the deep state” — perceived enemies in govt jobs.Trump vowed to impose tariffs on imported goods, particularly those from China, in bid to keep manufacturing jobs in the US.He is looking to reverse climate policies. He has pledged to increase production of fossil fuels, promising to “drill, drill, drill”.","Trump has said “within two seconds” of taking office that he would fire the special counsel who has been prosecuting two federal cases against him.

Who gets to keep the ring if engagement’s off? US court rules always the buyer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-gets-to-keep-the-ring-if-engagements-off-us-court-rules-always-the-buyer/articleshow/115157619.cms,"Representative photo

That’s what the highest court in Massachusetts was asked to decide with a $70,000 ring at the centre of the dispute. The court ultimately ruled that an engagement ring must be returned to the person who purchased it, ending a six-decade state rule that required judges to try to identify who was to blame for the end of the relationship.The case involved Bruce Johnson and Caroline Settino, who started dating in the summer of 2016, according to court filings. Over the next year, they travelled together across the United States and to Italy. Johnson paid for the vacations and also gave Settino jewellery, clothing, shoes and handbags. Eventually, Johnson bought a $70,000 diamond ring and in Aug 2017 asked Settino’s father for permission to marry her.Johnson said he felt like after that Settino became increasingly critical and unsupportive, including berating him and not accompanying him to treatments when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, according to court filings. At some point Johnson looked at Settino’s cell phone and discovered a message from her to a man he didn’t know. “My Bruce is going to be in Connecticut for three days. I need some playtime,” the message read. He also found messages from the man, including a voicemail in which the man referred to Settino as “cupcake” and said they didn’t see enough of each other. Settino has said the man was just a friend.Johnson ended the engagement. But ownership of the ring remained up in the air.A trial judge initially concluded Settino was entitled to keep the engagement ring, reasoning that Johnson “mistakenly thought Settino was cheating on him”. An appeals court found Johnson should get the ring. In Sept, the case landed before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court , which ultimately ruled that Johnson should keep the ring. In their ruling the justices said the case raised the question of whether the issue of “who is at fault” should continue to govern the rights to engagement rings when the wedding doesn’t happen. More than six decades ago, the court found that an engagement ring is generally understood to be a conditional gift and determined that the person who gives it can get it back after a failed engagement, but only if that person was “without fault”.Harvard Law School professor Rebecca Tushnet, who studies engagement ring law, said she wasn’t surprised that the court rejected the fault standard, saying it really doesn’t fit with modern family law.","The case involved Bruce Johnson and Caroline Settino, who started dating in the summer of 2016.

"50,000 Russian & North Korean troops mass ahead of attack, say US & Ukrainian officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/50000-russian-north-korean-troops-mass-ahead-of-attack-say-us-ukrainian-officials/articleshow/115157550.cms,"NYT photo

The Russian military has assembled a force of 50,000 soldiers, including North Korean troops, as it prepares to begin an assault aimed at reclaiming territory seized by Ukraine in the Kursk region of Russia, according to US and Ukrainian officials.A new US assessment concludes that Russia has massed the force without having to pull soldiers out of Ukraine’s east — its main battlefield priority — allowing Moscow to press on multiple fronts simultaneously.Russian troops have been clawing back some of the territory that Ukraine captured in Kursk this year. They have been attacking Ukrainian positions with missile strikes and artillery fire, but they have not yet begun a major assault there, US officials said. Ukrainian officials say they expect such an attack involving the North Korean troops in the coming days. For now, the North Koreans are training with Russian forces in the far western part of Kursk.The Russian-North Korean offensive looms as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to re-enter office with a stated goal of ending the war quickly. Trump has said little about how he would settle the conflict, but Vice-President-elect JD Vance has outlined a plan that would allow Russia to keep the territory it has seized in Ukraine.Some US military and intelligence officials have grown more pessimistic about Ukraine’s overall prospects, noting that Russia has steadily gained ground, both in Kursk and in eastern Ukraine. Officials say the setbacks are partly a result of Ukraine’s failure to solve critical shortfalls in troop strength. President Biden has been deeply supportive of Ukraine, pushing Congress to approve billions of dollars in aid and having the US military and spy agencies provide critical intelligence to help Kyiv fight the war.One Western official said Ukraine’s surprise incursion into Kursk thinned out its forces across the battlefield in eastern Ukraine, leaving them vulnerable to Russian advances. But that official, and US officials, said Ukraine still had a strong defence in Kursk and might be able to hold, at least for a time. The officials interviewed for this article spoke anonymously.","Russian troops have been clawing back some of the territory that Ukraine captured in Kursk this year.

Knee Surgery Meme: Explaining the evolution of 'That feeling when knee surgery is tomorrow' meme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explaining-the-evolution-of-that-feeling-when-knee-surgery-is-tomorrow-meme/articleshow/115139251.cms,"What does the joke mean

What makes the joke intriguing

When did the meme originate

The ""That feeling when knee surgery is tomorrow"" meme, also known as the Blue Grinch meme , expresses a specific emotional state associated with a pending knee surgery.The knee surgery meme , which gained widespread popularity, traces its origins to an earlier version featuring a squirrel image.The meme finds humor in a highly specific and relatable situation, creating an instant connection for those who have experienced the anxiety of an upcoming medical procedure, specifically knee surgery.The inclusion of the ""Blue Grinch"" character amplifies the sense of nervousness and lack of energy surrounding the experience.The humor lies in its highly specific focus, serving as both a commentary on traditional meme conventions and a departure from them, the Daily Dot reported.The meme focuses on such specific and nuanced situations that its precision itself becomes the punchline, providing a clever commentary on meme culture that is both humorous and insightful.While most memes strive for widespread appeal by tapping into universal emotions, the ""knee surgery"" meme maintains a deliberately narrow scope, which sets it apart.According to Know Your Meme, the first version of this meme was created in 2021 by an anonymous user on MemeCreator.org. It featured an animated squirrel standing upright with its front paws raised, capturing widespread attention when it appeared on the Instagram account stupid.fricken.meme later that year.At present, the ""Blue Grinch knee surgery"" memes remain notably non-political in nature. While it's common for memes that start as neutral to take on political or unexpected directions, this particular format mainly serves as a self-referential commentary on meme culture.","The Blue Grinch meme expresses a specific emotional state associated with knee surgery.

Republicans secure control of Senate

Trump assembles new administration

Donald Trump has emerged victorious in Arizona, flipping the state back into the Republican column after it was narrowly won by Joe Biden in 2020. This decisive win in the crucial battleground state, which carries 11 electoral votes, has propelled Trump’s Electoral College total to 312, compared to Vice President Kamala Harris' 226. Arizona, historically a key swing state, had been seen as a stronghold for Democrats in recent years.The win in Arizona also marks Trump’s success in all seven battleground states, including Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, all of which he had lost in 2020. This sweeping reversal of fortunes reflects his continued strong appeal among conservative and working-class voters, including a substantial share of Hispanic voters in states like Arizona.In addition to securing the presidency, Republicans have reclaimed control of the Senate, winning 52 seats to the Democrats' 47, with strong performances in key states. The House of Representatives is also expected to remain under Republican control, with CNN reporting GOP victories in 213 seats, close to the 218 needed for a majority. NBC currently projects Republicans at 212 seats, with Democrats holding 204, though senior Democrats still hope for a narrow win to counterbalance Trump's legislative power.Democrats, meanwhile, are internally questioning the decision to replace Biden with Harris at the top of the ticket only 100 days before the election, with some, like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, suggesting an earlier withdrawal by Biden could have opened the field for stronger candidates.With victory secured, Trump is already preparing for his second term. Susie Wiles, his campaign manager, has been named White House Chief of Staff, marking a historic first for a woman in the role. Trump has ruled out appointing Mike Pompeo and Nikki Haley to Cabinet roles, instead favouring new faces like former ambassador to Germany Ric Grenell for secretary of state, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known for his anti-vaccine stance, is also expected to play a prominent role in health policy, with Elon Musk being considered for a role in government auditing.","Donald Trump has won Arizona, flipping the state back into the Republican column.

A teenager in British Columbia has tested positive for bird flu, marking Canada’s first confirmed human case of the H5 strain.Authorities announced the news on Saturday, stating that the individual is currently receiving treatment at a children’s hospital in British Columbia, where specialists are closely monitoring their condition.The provincial health department has launched an investigation to trace the infection’s source and identify any potential contacts. Health officials suspect the transmission likely originated from an animal, with British Columbia Health Officer Dr Bonnie Henry stressing the unusual nature of the case.""This is a rare event,"" British Columbia Health Officer Bonnie Henry said in a statement, ""We are conducting a thorough investigation to fully understand the source of exposure here in BC""While avian flu is typically found in wild birds and poultry, recent reports have shown the virus appearing in mammals, with outbreaks impacting various species across North America, including cattle in the United States this year. Although human cases remain infrequent, health experts have raised concerns about bird flu’s potential to mutate and spread among humans, especially as animal cases increase.The risks associated with bird flu are heightened by the virus’s capacity to jump species, which could eventually facilitate human-to-human transmission—a development scientists worry could pose a significant public health risk.In another case, officials in the United States recently reported an avian flu infection in a person from Missouri, notably the first instance where no direct exposure to infected animals was identified. All previous cases in the US, beginning in 2022, involved farmworkers who had direct contact with infected poultry.While there have been occasional human cases of H5 avian flu globally, sustained human-to-human transmission has yet to be observed.Avian influenza has affected approximately 450 dairy establishments across 15 states in the United States since March, while the CDC has documented 46 human infections since April.In British Columbia, Canada, authorities have detected the virus in at least 22 poultry operations since October, with multiple wild birds also testing positive, as per provincial data.","A teenager in British Columbia has tested positive for bird flu, marking Canada’s first confirmed human case of the H5 strain.

US supreme court justice Sonia Sotomayor has no plans to resign from her position, despite some urging President Biden to appoint a successor before the conclusion of his term and the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.“She’s in great health, and the court needs her now more than ever,” said one source, according to a CNN report.Vermont senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) also said on Sunday that Sotomayor shouldn’t resign from her position. “I don’t think it’s sensible,” Sanders said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”Some progressive voices have suggested that justice Sotomayor retire to allow Biden to appoint a new liberal justice before January, when Republicans are expected to take control of the senate. However, Sotomayor has opted not to retire.The confirmation process for a supreme court nominee takes several months, making it nearly impossible to complete before January, even without complications.Born on June 25, 1954, in the Bronx, Sotomayor is the daughter of Juan Sotomayor and Celina Baez, both of whom are from Puerto Rico. The bold federal trial court judge, who prevented a damaging Major League Baseball strike in 1995, made history as the first Hispanic and third woman to serve on the US Supreme Court.Despite openly discussing her experience with type 1 diabetes, Sotomayor remains an active presence on the court. She is known for her rigorous questioning during oral arguments and has been vocal about her concerns regarding the court's increasingly conservative direction.","Sonia Sotomayor has no plans to resign from her position, despite some urging President Biden to appoint a successor before the conclusion of his term and the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.“She’s in great health, and the court needs her now more than ever,” said one source.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115153995,imgsize-1089675,width-400,resizemode-4/115153995.jpg"

""Reports that the Ukrainian side was informed in advance of the alleged call are false. As a result, Ukraine could not have endorsed or opposed the call,"" foreign ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi told Reuters.Meanwhile, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that US President Joe Biden aims to ensure a smooth transfer of power and remains committed to advocating for Ukraine in his upcoming meeting with Trump. ""President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, as walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe,"" he said.The Kremlin confirmed Putin's willingness to discuss Ukraine with Trump on Friday but stressed that it did not signify any change in Moscow's demands. Putin's terms for ending the war, outlined on June 14, include Ukraine abandoning its NATO aspirations and withdrawing its troops from the four regions claimed by Russia.Ukraine, however, has rejected these demands, deeming them unacceptable.

US President Joe Biden will meet with President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday to discuss domestic and foreign policy priorities, with a particular focus on securing continued support for Ukraine.National security adviser Jake Sullivan confirmed the meeting on CBS News' ""Face the Nation,"" saying Biden aims to ensure a smooth transfer of power and discuss critical global issues with the incoming president. Ukraine is expected to be a key topic, according to media reports.Sullivan stressed Biden's commitment to advocating for Ukraine, saying:""President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe.”Trump has previously criticised the level of US funding for Ukraine, aligning with some Republican lawmakers who have expressed reservations about the ongoing financial commitment. With Republicans poised to control the senate and potentially the House, securing future aid packages for Ukraine could prove challenging for the Biden administration.The meeting follows a significant escalation in the conflict, with Ukraine launching its largest drone strike on Moscow since the war began.The outcome of Wednesday's meeting could have significant implications for the future of US involvement in the Ukraine conflict.","US President Joe Biden will meet with President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday.

A New York Parks employee died on Saturday afternoon while battling a wildfire in Orange County. The fires, one of several blazes raging in New Jersey and New York, have prompted air quality warnings in both states due to dry conditions.The worker, identified as 18-year-old Dariel Vasquez, lost his life when a tree fell on him while he was fighting a fire along the New York-New Jersey border in Sterling Forest near Greenwood Lake. Vasquez was an aide with the state parks and recreation department.New York State Police are investigating the incident.New York governor Kathy Hochul expressed grief over the incident, saying, as quoted by Fox News, ""I am deeply saddened by the passing of one of our New York State Parks employees while responding to a wildfire in Orange County yesterday. My prayers go out to his family, friends, and coworkers during this difficult time.""“RIP, brother. Your shift is over—job well done,” the New York State forestry services posted online.The largest fire, known as the Jennings Creek wildfire , has expanded to nearly four square miles near the border in Passaic County, New Jersey. Officials report it threatens over a dozen structures in Greenwood Lake, New York, and ten homes and buildings in New Jersey's Long Pond Ironworks Historic District.Health advisories were issued for parts of New York, including New York City, and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality from the smoke. The advisories urge people to limit strenuous outdoor activity, especially young children, the elderly, and those with asthma or heart disease.Firefighters in New Jersey are also battling a 175-acre fire in Passaic County that is threatening homes, along with several smaller fires in other parts of the state.Meanwhile, in Massachusetts, dry conditions and strong winds fueled a wildfire that burned over 200 acres in Lynn Woods Reservation, a large park north of Boston. “This is a dry spell we have not seen during this time of year in many years,” the Lynn Fire Department stated, attributing the fire's intensity to low humidity, wind, and dry leaves.Firefighters and forest agencies across the Northeast are warning against outdoor burning as dry conditions are expected to continue.","18-year-old Dariel Vasquez died when a tree fell on him in Sterling Forest near Greenwood Lake, New York.

'A pragmatic way': Vivek Ramaswamy backs Trump's mass deportation plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-pragmatic-way-vivek-ramaswamy-backs-trumps-mass-deportation-plans/articleshow/115149839.cms,"Donald Trump and Vivek Ramaswamy (Picture credit: AP)

Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy on Sunday backed President-elect Donald Trump ’s administration's mass deportation plans, characterising it as a ""pragmatic"" approach and suggesting it aligns with the views of many Americans.Speaking on ABC's ""This Week"" in an interview with Jonathan Karl, Ramaswamy acknowledged that the US has a broken legal immigration system but added that the first step should be to restore the rule of law in a pragmatic way.""Do we have a broken legal immigration system? Yes, we do, but I think the first step is going to be to restore the rule of law and do it in a very pragmatic way,” Ramaswamy said, as quoted by Politico.He stressed that most Americans likely agree that individuals who have entered the country illegally and committed a crime should be deported, describing it as the largest mass deportation.“A pragmatic way. I don’t think most Americans disagree with me to say those who have entered, those who have committed a crime, they should be out of the country. That would be the largest mass deportation,"" he said.While Ramaswamy did not confirm specific figures regarding the number of potential deportations, he stressed that those who entered the country illegally in recent months ""have no place in this country."" He advocated for a ""pragmatic"" approach that prioritises the deportation of individuals who have committed crimes, a move he believes would result in a historically significant mass deportation.Ramaswamy also called for a halt to all federal funding that supports illegal immigration, including aid to sanctuary cities. He believes this would encourage self-deportation. ""Not an iota, not a cent of government spending should go to subsidize this,” he said. ""Not to sanctuary cities, not to federal aid for people in this country illegally, and we’ll see a large number—by the millions—of self-deportations as well.”Although acknowledging Trump's commitment to respecting the dignity of Americans, Ramaswamy did not rule out the possibility of deporting individuals protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. ""I say this as the child of legal immigrants to this country, the proud child of legal immigrants to the United States of America,” he explained. ""If your first act of entering this country broke the law, that doesn’t allow you to remain in this country. You have no right to enter the United States.”When asked about his own political future, including the possibility of serving in the Trump administration or pursuing the open Ohio Senate seat, Ramaswamy remained open to possibilities. ""There are a couple of great options on the table,” he said. “I want to have the biggest possible impact on the country.”","Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy backs President-elect Donald Trump's mass deportation plans.

The kissing video, posted to his YouTube channel, sparked outrage among viewers.""I want to apologize to Koreans. I didn't understand the significance of the statue,"" Somali said in a video posted Thursday on the Jcompany YouTube channel. He explained that his actions were intended to entertain his American audience. The video shows Somali bowing before the statue at the Changdong History and Culture Park and saying in Korean, ""I'm truly sorry for being disrespectful.""Despite his apology and his expressed interest in learning about the history of Japan's wartime sexual slavery, some viewers remain unconvinced of Somali's sincerity. Their skepticism arises from Somali's failure to remove other controversial content from his social media accounts.This includes a photo on his Instagram account, originally captioned ""I defeated Koreans for you, Shinzo Abe ,"" featuring Somali holding a picture of the former Japanese prime minister. While the YouTube post has been deleted, the Instagram caption was changed to ""RIP Shinzo Abe!"" as of Friday.

"'Mass deportation, purge government, pardon himself': What Trump cards will Donald play on day 1",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mass-deportation-purge-government-pardon-himself-what-trump-cards-will-donald-play-on-day-1/articleshow/115145576.cms,"Pardon himself, rioters



'Settle Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours'



Roll back protections for transgender students



'Totally obliterate deep state' of govt workers



'Drill, drill, drill'



From pardoning himself in most of criminal cases to reversing climate policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Donald Trump's bucket list of dos and donts on day one of assuming the Oval office is all set to raise the 'temperature' of the United States of America quite literally.His agenda includes initiating mass deportations of migrants, reversing key Biden administration education policies, overhauling the federal government by dismissing thousands of federal employees he believes are undermining him, and granting pardons to individuals arrested for their involvement in the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot.“I want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill,"" he said of his day 1 plans, as quoted by the Associated Press.Within ""two seconds"" of assuming office, President-elect Trump said that he would fire Jack Smith, the special counsel overseeing two federal cases against him. Smith is already considering how to conclude the cases, citing a longstanding Justice Department policy that prevents the prosecution of sitting presidents.Since the Capitol attack nearly four years ago, more than 1,500 people have been charged in connection with the violent siege by Trump supporters. “I am inclined to pardon many of them,"" Trump had said in March, adding, “I can’t say for every single one, because a couple of them, probably they got out of control.”Trump cannot pardon himself for his state conviction in New York related to the hush money case. However, as president-elect, he could attempt to use his position to have his felony conviction overturned or expunged, potentially avoiding a prison sentence. Meanwhile, his case in Georgia, where he faces charges of election interference, is likely to be the only remaining criminal case. It would probably be delayed until at least 2029, after his presidential term ends, especially with the Georgia prosecutor having just won reelection.Trump has repeatedly claimed that he could resolve the war between Russia and Ukraine in just one day. However, Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, dismissed the idea, stating that ""the Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day.""“They’re dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I’ll have that done — I’ll have that done in 24 hours,” Trump had told CNN in May.During his campaign, Trump promised to roll back Biden administration policies aimed at protecting transgender students from discrimination in schools, vowing to take action on his first day in office. Opposition to transgender rights became a central theme of his campaign’s final push, with a campaign ad targeting Vice President Kamala Harris. The ad featured a narrator saying, “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”“Don’t forget, that was done as an order from the president. That came down as an executive order. And we’re going to change it — on Day 1 it’s going to be changed,” Trump had said in May.In April, the Biden administration introduced new Title IX protections, making it clear that treating transgender students differently from their peers constitutes discrimination. In response, Trump pledged to reverse these changes, asserting that he would take action immediately upon taking office, emphasizing his ability to act unilaterally without needing congressional approval.Trump aims to overhaul the federal workforce by stripping tens of thousands of career employees of their civil service protections, making it easier to fire them. His goal is twofold: significantly reduce the size of the federal government, which he has long criticized as an unnecessary drain, and “totally obliterate the deep state” — the network of career officials he believes are undermining his administration.While politically appointed officials change with each administration, career employees are typically seen as nonpartisan experts who help maintain stability and continuity in government. Trump wants to convert some of these career positions into political roles, allowing him to replace them with loyalists. To do this, he plans to revive a 2020 executive order, “Schedule F,” which would strip job protections from roughly 50,000 of the 2.2 million civilian federal employees and create a new class of political appointees.Trump aims to reverse key climate policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. On his first day in office, he plans to use an executive order to roll back environmental protections, halt wind energy projects, dismantle Biden's electric car transition goals, and eliminate corporate sustainability standards.He has also pledged to boost US fossil fuel production, promising to “drill, drill, drill” on Day 1. Additionally, he seeks to open the Arctic wilderness to oil drilling, arguing that it would help lower energy costs.","'I want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, Drill,"" he said of his day 1 plans, as quoted by the Associated Press.

However, loans are still necessary to service existing debts, most of which are owed to Western financial institutions.The country had anticipated raising $3.2 billion against the $2.5 billion in debt needs since IMF’s approval of a $7 billion package for Pakistan in September. This included a $1.2 billion Saudi oil facility.As per sources, no agreement has been reached regarding the Saudi oil facility, five months into the fiscal year.Each month of delay reduces available funds by $100 million within the fiscal year. Pakistani authorities remain optimistic about convincing Riyadh to extend the facility. However, finance ministry spokesperson Qumar Abbasi did not respond to queries regarding the status of the $1.2 billion oil facility.Apart from IMP, Pakistan is also seeking a $1 billion loan from Dubai Islamic Bank, while requesting China to reschedule $3.4 billion in debt from China's Export-Import (Exim) Bank.Out of this amount, approximately $750 million is due in the current fiscal year. The rescheduling of this debt has been included in the country's external financing plans, as per sources.Due to its weakened financial position and the constraints imposed by the IMF agreement, Pakistan lacks the flexibility to repay its debt to China.Around $3.9 billion, of the total $6.5 billion in Chinese commercial debt, is due in the current fiscal year. The government successfully rolled over a $200 million debt that matured in September. However, sources suggest that no progress has been made in arranging another rollover, with a $1 billion payment due in March 2025.As part of its $3.2 billion plan, the government also secured Pakistan's most expensive loan in history—a $600 million facility from Standard Chartered Bank. The finance minister stated that this facility would not be utilized, while the IMF distanced itself from the loan arrangement.IMF's unexpected visit comes just six weeks after the loan's approval and four months before the planned review, which will evaluate performance against the July-September targets and assess progress for the October-December 2024 quarter.Official figures show a tax collection shortfall of Rs 190 billion over the past four months, with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collecting Rs 3.440 trillion, against a target of Rs 3.632 trillion, despite record-high taxes this year.",IMF's unexpected visit comes just six weeks after the loan's approval and four months before the planned review.

According to Swiss air quality monitor IQAir, Lahore’s AQI rose to 760, while Multan reached a staggering 1,914, making it one of the most polluted cities worldwide.The extreme pollution has left authorities scrambling to control the smog, with limited success reported.Lahore, under a thick blanket of smog for days, has witnessed widespread road closures due to low visibility, leading to multiple accidents. A serious incident on GT Road near Kalashah Kako saw nine people injured when a van collided with a stationary truck, its driver unable to see the parked vehicle through the dense haze.The smog has also forced Lahore high court to mandate a shutdown of all trade activities by 8 pm and close markets on Sundays, aiming to minimize pollution-inducing activity.In Multan, conditions reached what experts called ""apocalyptic"" levels, with the AQI exceeding 2,000 on Friday morning. The concentration of PM2.5—a hazardous particulate matter known to cause severe respiratory and cardiovascular issues—was recorded at 947 micrograms per cubic meter, nearly 190 times above World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The WHO deems PM2.5 levels above five micrograms per cubic meter harmful.In response, the state government is on high alert, implementing emergency measures to curb pollution levels. Public parks and museums across major cities have been closed until at least November 17.Authorities have also faced criticism for failing to enforce preemptive anti-smog directives, with citizens often seen without masks despite the severe air quality.Multan, the largest city in southern Punjab, recorded an extremely dangerous Air Quality Index (AQI) of 2,135 between 8am and 9am on Friday, according to data from IQAir, as reported by Dawn.

Several monitors across Multan, including those at the WWF-Pakistan Office, Shamsabad Colony, and Multan Cantonment, showed AQI levels as high as 2,316, 1,635, and 1,527 respectively.Authorities in Pakistan have attributed the worsening air quality in Lahore to cross-border winds carrying pollutants from neighboring India, alleging that these winds have pushed smog levels to ""dangerous"" extremes.","Pakistan's Air Quality Index (AQI) has soared to unprecedented levels, sparking alarm across Punjab province. Lahore's AQI rose to 760, while Multan reached a staggering 1,914, making it one of the most polluted cities worldwide.

At least 26 people — 14 soldiers, six railway employees and six civilian passengers — were killed and more than 60 injured in a suicide bombing at a railway station in Pakistan’s southwestern city of Quetta on Saturday. The proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), the most prominent militant group in the restive province, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying its suicide unit, the Majeed Brigade, had carried out the bombing to target a “Pakistani army unit” returning via train after completing a course at an infantry school.Authorities said the blast was a “suicide attack” primarily on law enforcement agencies, while civilians were also targeted. Forty-six among the injured were Pakistan army soldiers, police said. The explosion occurred as a popular morning train, Jaffar Express, was about to leave a station in Quetta for Peshawar in the northwest.Pakistan Railways had restored train services between Quetta and Peshawar last month after a suspension of seven weeks because separatist militants in Balochistan had blown up a key railway bridge in Aug.Social media videos captured Saturday’s explosion. The bomb went off when hundreds of people were at the platform. A video of the aftermath showed injured individuals and debris strewn throughout the station. The steel structure of the platform’s roof had been ripped apart.“The target was army personnel from the Infantry School,” said Muazzam Jah Ansari, police chief of Balochistan province.Wasim Baig, spokesperson for the provincial health department, said the death toll rose to 26 after two people succumbed to their injuries in hospital while 62 others were injured.The BLA has long waged an armed rebellion, driven by demands for independence and control over the province’s gas and mineral resources.Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti called the act deplorable and the perpetrators “worse than animals”. He said the authorities would pursue them and “bring them to their logical end”.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced the bombing, saying those who orchestrated the attack “will pay a very heavy price for it”, adding that security forces were determined to eliminate “the menace of terrorism”.A decades-old insurgency has destabilised Balochistan and created security concerns for China-led projects trying to access the province’s untapped resources. In Aug at least 73 people were killed in Balochistan province after separatist militants attacked police stations, railway lines and highways.Balochistan is Pakistan’s largest province and the richest in terms of natural resources, but it is the least developed. The region shares a volatile border with Iran and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, and also boasts a vast coastline along the Arabian Sea.The govt’s military operation to suppress the separatist movement in the province has resulted in widespread human rights abuses against Baloch dissenters, including disappearances, torture and extrajudicial killings.","14 soldiers, six railway employees and six civilian passengers killed.

KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA: Front Line Defenders have condemned the arrest of human rights defender Idris Khattak, demanding his immediate release due to safety issues and deteriorating health .According to Front Line Defenders, Idris Khattak was abducted on November 13, 2019, and was later tried by the military court under the Official Secrets Act . In December 2021, he was sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment.In the 5 years of imprisonment, the human rights defender has gone through unsanitary and unsafe conditions in the jail.In a post on X, the Front Line Defenders stated, ""We urge Pakistani authorities to immediately end the persecution and incarceration of HRD Idris Khattak , especially given his age and underlying health concerns. Following his enforced disappearance , and 5 years of unjust imprisonment for his human rights work campaigning for religious and ethnic minorities , we call for his immediate and safe release to his family.""Idris Khattak is a prominent human rights advocate in Pakistan. His activism has focused on defending the rights of religious and ethnic minorities, often in the face of systematic state repression. Khattak has been particularly vocal about abuses carried out by military and intelligence agencies, especially in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region, which has experienced ongoing conflict and instability.United Nations human rights experts also lamented the conviction and said, ""Mr. Khattak's reported sentencing is an attack against the human rights community in Pakistan and sends a chilling message to civil society activists monitoring and reporting on alleged violations, committed by the military and security forces or with their consent or acquiescence, such as systematic or widespread enforced disappearances.""Pakistan is known for violating human rights by forcibly disappearing the activists and defenders.

Amid attempts to strike a balance in its relations with the US and China, Pakistan has said it can help bridge the differences between the two world powers.Relations between Washington and Beijing have been strained over their attempts to increase their global influence. The tensions stem mainly from disagreements over trade, Taiwan, the South China Sea and China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).While Pakistan has aligned itself with the US for military cooperation and counter-terrorism efforts, it relies heavily on China to address its financial woes. Islamabad has strengthened economic ties with Beijing through initiatives like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).“Pakistan has the potential to serve as a bridge between China and the United States,” Pakistan ambassador to Washington Rizwan Saeed Sheikh was quoted as saying by state-run Radio Pakistan on Friday.The statement was made just hours after Pakistan’s foreign office declared on Thursday that Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election would not impact Pakistan’s ties with China. When questioned on the matter, Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch had responded, “Pakistan’s relations with China are all-weather. They are strategic and a source of stability in our foreign policy.”Baloch said Islamabad does not even need to consider the possibility that its relationship with China will be affected by any domestic development in another country.The intricate rivalry between the US and China affects Pakistan as it manages its strategic alliances with both powers while enduring a protracted economic crisis.“Our relations with the US are decades old, and we look forward to further strengthen and broaden the Pakistan-US relationship in all fields,” Baloch said. “As the deputy PM (Ishaq Dar) said in a tweet yesterday, we look forward to fruitful and mutually beneficial cooperation between Pakistan and the US.”During the Cold War, Pakistan and the US had developed close defence ties, but their relationship was also put to the test by different priorities on various issues.Relations between the two had soured in recent years as Washington accused Islamabad of aiding the Taliban in their 2021 takeover of Kabul, accusations that Islamabad denied. Tensions increased even more between the two countries when Pakistan’s jailed former PM Imran Khan accused the Biden administration of planning his removal through a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in April 2022, a claim denied by the US.","Pakistan has said it can help bridge the differences between the two world powers.

They are accused of involvement in “killings and genocide” during the student-led uprising in July-Aug that led to Hasina’s ouster. “It will be done very soon,” law adviser Asif Nazrul said on Sunday.France-based Interpol publishes red notices at the request of a member nation, based on an arrest warrant issued in their home country. The Yunus-led administration has moved quickly to try the top Awami League functionaries, including Hasina and general secretary Obaidul Quader, by having arrest warrants issued against them through International Crimes Tribunal (ICT). A local court has ordered the authorities to arrest and present them before it by Nov 18. ICT chief prosecutor Muhammad Tajul Islam said steps would be taken to bring Awami League to justice if the govt issues directives.The development came even as complaint of “genocide” and other crimes was filed at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague against 62 individuals, including interim govt chief adviser Muhammad Yunus.The complaint was filed by former Sylhet mayor Anwaruzzaman Chowdhury. Other than Yunus and his advisers, Chowdhury also wants co-ordinators of the students’ uprising prosecuted. Chowdhury has alleged “genocide and crimes against humanity against Awami League’s leaders and activists, Hindus, Christians, Buddhists and police in Bangladesh, all of whom were killed in the name of the students’ movement”. The complaint was lodged under Article 15 of ICC’s Rome Statute, which empowers individuals and others to send information on crimes within the court’s jurisdiction. Yunus’ law adviser Nazrul dismissed the plea as an attempt to mislead global opinion. “This is not a case. It is just a petition. Any person can do that,” he said.",Bangladesh's interim govt wants to repatriate deposed PM Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League colleagues from abroad.

Bangladesh announced on Sunday that it would request an Interpol ""red notice"" alert for fugitive leaders from the ousted regime of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was overthrown during a revolution in August.""Those responsible for the indiscriminate killings during the mass uprising in July and August will be brought back from wherever they have taken refuge"", Asif Nazrul, the interim government's law advisor, told reporters.Since Hasina's regime collapsed, dozens of her allies have been arrested for their involvement in a violent police crackdown that led to the deaths of over 700 people during the unrest.France-based Interpol issues red notices at the request of a member nation based on an arrest warrant from the home country.Nazrul did not name any individuals specifically but confirmed that Bangladesh had already issued an arrest warrant for Hasina, who was last seen fleeing to India by helicopter after her palace was stormed by protesters. Hasina, who ruled for 15 years, faced accusations of widespread human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings and mass detentions of political opponents.Red notices alert law enforcement agencies worldwide about fugitives, but they do not compel countries to arrest and extradite the individuals. According to Interpol, each member country applies its own laws when deciding whether to act on a red notice.Hasina has been summoned to appear in a Dhaka court on November 18 to face charges of ""massacres, killings, and crimes against humanity.""Mohammad Tajul Islam, the chief prosecutor of Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), said the court had issued arrest warrants for over 60 individuals, with around 25 arrests made so far.","Bangladesh announces it will request Interpol ""red notice"" alert for fugitive leaders.

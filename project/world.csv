Users across X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, TikTok, and Reddit have expressed solidarity, with some regarding him as a hero.Authorities apprehended Mangione in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after a McDonald's worker identified him. He faces firearms charges and remains a key suspect in Thompson's death. NYPD Chief of Detectives Joe Kenny confirmed finding a ghost gun, suppressor, and anti-healthcare system manifesto in his possession, Newsweek reported.Social media's response to the executive's public killing has been notably casual, reflecting widespread dissatisfaction with American healthcare across political divisions.Following police disclosure of Mangione's identity, his social media accounts - @PepMangione on X and @luigi.from.fiji on Instagram - attracted thousands of new followers. Supporters have left encouraging messages on his previous posts.Luigi Mangione's Instagram account, @luigi.from.fiji, sees a surge in followers, reaching 21.5K amid the growing #FreeLuigi movement on social media.

"Who is Luigi Mangione, suspect in the UnitedHealth CEO shooting?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-luigi-mangione-suspect-in-the-unitedhealth-ceo-shooting/articleshow/116154879.cms,"Luigi Mangione comes from a wealthy family in Maryland and is an Ivy League graduate from the University of Pennsylvania.

Valedictorian at his $37,000-a-year all-boys prep school. Founder of a gaming club and graduate at an Ivy League university. A rapidly ascending data engineer at TrueCar Inc.Luigi Nicholas Mangione was all that. And now, he is also the suspect in the coldblooded killing of insurance executive Brian Thompson , a 50-year-old father of two gunned down last week in Midtown Manhattan.To some, Mangione — if he is indeed the killer — represents a folk hero acting on the collective rage of a nation against the perceived faults of the insurance industry. Others see him as the face of a country where law and order has broken down, morality has collapsed and company executives are scapegoated with deadly consequences for systemic inequities.Mangione, 26, was arrested by the police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Monday after authorities were alerted to a “suspicious male” who looked like the person wanted for the shooting of the UnitedHealth Group Inc executive December 4.He was found with a homemade gun and a manifesto, which a person familiar with the matter described as anti-capitalist and critical of health-care companies’ profit motives. It said he acted alone and was self-funded, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential matters and declined to elaborate.Mangione appeared in court in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, for a preliminary arraignment for charges on five counts, including forgery, carrying a gun without a license and showing law enforcement false identification, according to a criminal complaint released by the state court system. Details on a lawyer for Mangione weren’t immediately available.A survey of his online presence shows Mangione — who attended the University of Pennsylvania — praised the manifesto of another Ivy League graduate known for violent acts aimed at corporate targets, the Unabomber, calling his insights “prescient” on the book-review website Goodreads.By all accounts, Mangione appears to have had a privileged upbringing in Maryland, the product of a wealthy family with various business interests. His mother is a travel agent, and he had ties across the country and the world, most recently living in Honolulu.He attended the prestigious Gilman School in Baltimore and graduated as valedictorian in 2016. In his valedictory address, Mangione highlighted his classmates’ innovative spirit.“Having great ideas, however, isn’t enough,” he said. “The class of 2016’s inventiveness also stems from its incredible courage to explore the unknown and try new things.”At the University of Pennsylvania, he earned both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in engineering, computer and information science in 2020. He also founded the university’s first video-game development club. “Our goal is to have fun and learn,” Mangione told The Daily Pennsylvanian.The summer before he graduated, he worked as the head counselor and an artificial intelligence teaching assistant at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, designing lesson plans and teaching high school students. The work involved supervising more than three dozen students, according to his LinkedIn account. He helped create an “inclusive, fun, and stimulating” community among the residential staff, he wrote.He began working as a data engineer at TrueCar in November 2020, and garnered his first promotion less than a year later. By October 2022, he was a data engineer III, working across more than a dozen technologies on lease and loan payments, pricing data sources and performance tracking. (His employment with TrueCar ended in 2023, the company said. It declined to provide any additional information.)Mangione was taken into custody at a McDonald’s restaurant after an employee reported a resemblance to the suspect in the nationwide manhunt. He had what appeared to be a ghost gun, made using a 3D printer to circumvent any paperwork or legal details involved in purchasing a firearm. It fired the same type of bullet that killed Thompson, though ballistics testing was still pending, said Joseph Kenny, the chief of New York Police Department detectives.Mangione’s social media posting provided some insight into his life. He left reviews of Surfbreak and the Hub on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, praising the “community of travelers and entrepreneurs” at Surfbreak, a co-living space, and said the Hub, a co-working site, was a “warm, energizing place.”“Both memberships have enabled me to meet so many interesting people, and the combination of the two has provided the perfect balance of work and life,” according to the review he posted as @luig.man.Fun and enjoyment were paramount for Mangione, from his days at Stanford, to the video-game club he founded at Penn, to his living situation in Hawaii. But then, seemingly, things may have changed.On Goodreads, Mangione posted a positive review in June 2021 of Industrial Society and Its Future by Theodore Kaczynski, a mathematician and Harvard University graduate who became a domestic terrorist known as the Unabomber.It would be easy to write it off “as the manifesto of a lunatic,” in order to avoid facing some of the uncomfortable problems it identifies, Mangione wrote. “But it’s simply impossible to ignore how prescient many of his predictions about modern society turned out.”“He was a violent individual — rightfully imprisoned — who maimed innocent people,” Mangione wrote. “While these actions tend to be characterized as those of a crazy luddite, however, they are more accurately seen as those of an extreme political revolutionary.”Traffic on social media accounts seemed to indicate that family members were trying to locate Mangione as recently as two weeks ago, though it wasn’t possible to verify the accuracy of the posts which have since been taken down by X. Others speculated about a possible surfing accident and unsuccessful back surgery, which also went unconfirmed.The Goodreads account in his name lists at least five books about chronic back pain and fitness, and his X account banner features an X-ray image of a lower back with spinal screws that are often inserted during surgery.Such operations are notoriously difficult and often ineffective. They can also be hard to get in some instances, as some studies show the pain may ease with time and insurance companies crack down on the use of procedures and medications that can come with serious complications.Patients are increasingly frustrated with the role that insurers play as gatekeepers for certain types of medical procedures, according to Wendell Potter, a former Cigna Group communications executive who has written books that are critical of the industry. Some become especially distressed as they wait for approval of treatment for conditions that can cause extreme pain and loss of work, Potter said.“One of the biggest reasons that people have to access the health-care system is because of back and joint pain,” he said. “It can be expensive, and there are a lot of surgeries that are either delayed for one reason or another that should have taken place, or that have been approved and that weren’t necessary.”While the effectiveness of surgery for back pain is somewhat controversial, “the insurance companies put themselves in the position of being the decision-maker here, and that may not be an appropriate role for them,” he said. “You often have someone at an insurance company making a determination that runs contrary to what a patient’s doctor says a patient needs.”Social media on Monday evening was full of praise for Mangione, with Luigi the top trending topic on X and FREE HIM coming in at No. 7. #FreeLuigi gained traction on Instagram. The McDonald’s in Altoona, where Mangione was caught, also was hit by one-star reviews after the arrest, with one poster criticizing the “class traitor” who turned him in and another calling him “one of the brightest minds of our generation.”","Luigi Nicholas Mangione, 26, is the suspect in the killing of insurance executive Brian Thompson.

Rupert Murdoch loses fight to change family trust,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/rupert-murdoch-loses-fight-to-change-family-trust/articleshow/116155005.cms,"Rupert Murdoch

Rupert Murdoch lost his bid to change his family trust and hand sole control of his media empire to his eldest son.Edmund Gorman Jr, the Reno, Nevada, probate commissioner hearing the case, rendered a verdict on Saturday, the New York Times reported, citing a sealed document saying the elder Murdoch acted in “bad faith” when he tried to change an irrevocable trust to leave Lachlan Murdoch in charge.An attorney for Rupert Murdoch told the Times he intends to appeal the ruling.A spokesperson for the three Murdoch children who challenged their father’s efforts issued the following statement: “We welcome Commissioner Gorman’s decision and hope that we can move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members.”The case weighed heavily on the future of some of the highest-profile media properties in the world. Through a family trust, Murdoch, 93, owns about 40% of the voting stock in both Fox Corp , the parent of Fox News, and News Corp, which counts the Wall Street Journal and the Times of London among its many holdings.Upon Murdoch’s death, control of the trust was to be split among his four oldest kids. Instead, he sought to give voting power to Lachlan, who serves as chief executive officer of Fox and chairman of News Corp.The case was heard in probate court, which manages legal proceedings around the transfer of property after a person’s death, and wasn’t open to the public. News outlets, including the New York Times Co and CNN, unsuccessfully sought to open up the proceedings.A Nevada probate commissioner determined in June that Murdoch could change the trust as long as he was doing so in good faith and in the best interest of his heirs. Murdoch argued that the change would benefit all six of his children because it would prevent Lachlan’s more politically liberal siblings — Prudence, Elisabeth and James — from making Fox News more moderate, thus hurting its value as a conservative media brand.The trio chose to share legal counsel and take their father to court in a trial that began Sept. 16, arguing the change violates the trust’s original conditions and that they would be wrongfully disenfranchised. Murdoch hired his own team of lawyers, including former US Attorney General William Barr, who was added as a family representative to the trust.Nevada’s lack of income and inheritance taxes, as well as its confidentiality protections, have made it a top venue for family trust management. Picking Reno over the bustling hub of Las Vegas added another layer of privacy to the closed-door proceedings, according to Nevada probate lawyer Elyse Tyrell.Under Nevada law, the losing party can appeal within 14 days, which would escalate the case to the district probate judge; that judge can either reverse the previous judge’s recommendation, declaring it erroneous, or uphold it. One of the parties could then appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court.","Rupert Murdoch lost his bid to change his family trust and hand sole control of his media empire to his eldest son.

A Manhattan jury found Daniel Penny not guilty of criminally negligent homicide in the death of Jordan Neely. The incident, captured on video, happened on a crowded subway in May 2023 and sparked debate about mental health and crime.Penny faced a charge that could have resulted in a four-year prison sentence. The top charge, manslaughter, was dismissed Friday after the jury couldn't reach a verdict. Neely’s father was removed from the courtroom after an outburst.Prosecutors said Penny's initial reaction to protect passengers was understandable, but argued he used excessive force. They said Penny continued the chokehold after some passengers left and Neely stopped moving.Neely's legal team may appeal the verdict or pursue a civil lawsuit.Penny's defense argued Neely died from a genetic condition and drugs in his system. Defense attorney Steven Raiser told jurors Penny ""acted to save"" passengers from a ""violent and desperate"" Neely who ""scared the living daylights out of everybody."" The defense claimed self-defense.Prosecutors said Penny held Neely's neck too hard and too long. Jurors viewed video of the incident, police body camera footage, and Penny's interview with detectives.On Monday, the judge denied the defense's motion for a mistrial.

Police tracked the trail of clues that he left including the surveillance footage -- from the hostel where he stayed before the murder, the street where he sprayed bullets on Brian Thompson, from the Starbucks where he stopped by just before the murder to get a cup of coffee, a bottle of water and two energy bars. The casings of the bullet that he fires to kill Brian Thompson had three words engraved on them: Deny, defend, depose -- eerily similar to a 2010 book on insurance woes and the world also refer to the tactic that insurance companies deploy to delay payment. After the initial combing, NYPD sleuths concluded that the killer was not in NYC. A backpack was found in the Central Park area similar to the one the killer was seen carrying n surveillance footage. New York City mayor Eric Adams said the sleuths probably had a name for the killer but was not disclosing it as it would help the person to flee further.

A person of interest with a similar gun that was used in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was arrested in Pennsylvania Monday about 233 miles west of New York City, reports said. The man was nabbed while trying to use a fake ID at a McDonald's and was taken into custody by cops in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He had a manifesto on him when he was taken into custody. It is not yet known whether he killed 50-year-old Brian Thompson in front of the Hilton hotel in New York City, Wednesday.The reports said the person of interest had a gun, silencer, four fake IDs and other items “consistent” with what authorities were looking for in the case, sources said.He was nabbed on a tip called into local cops, who then apprehended him, sources said. The NYPD was on its way to Altoona late Monday morning.","A man with a gun thought to be similar to the one used in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO has been arrested in Pennsylvania.

(Reuters)

A 26-year-old man, identified as Luigi Mangione , was arrested Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania, in connection with the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson . Authorities say Mangione was found with a weapon consistent with the one used in Thompson's killing, as well as writings that appear to express anger toward corporate America. He was charged with weapons offenses, forgery, and other related charges.Mangione, who was born in Maryland and has ties to San Francisco and Honolulu, was taken into custody at a McDonald's after a sharp-eyed customer recognized him. The customer, who had seen news reports of Thompson’s death, alerted an employee, leading to Mangione’s arrest. Police say Mangione tried to avoid detection while on the run, but officers, including rookie Officer Tyler Frye, immediately recognized him when he lowered his mask during questioning.Authorities discovered a 3D-printed pistol , a silencer, and fake identification in Mangione's possession. He was carrying $10,000 in cash, including $2,000 in foreign currency, according to court documents. Mangione was charged with forgery, carrying firearms without a license, tampering with records, and providing false identification.Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks stated that Mangione was arraigned and ordered held without bail. His arrest follows a tense investigation as police retraced his movements from New York to Pennsylvania.Officials have yet to fully disclose the contents of the writings found with Mangione, but it is believed they contain references to his motivations, including resentment toward the health insurance industry .""This is a significant break in the case,"" said NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch. ""We are grateful for the quick thinking of the local community and law enforcement, which led to Mangione's capture.""As the investigation continues, questions remain regarding Mangione's connection to the killing of Thompson, who was ambushed in Manhattan while walking to the company’s annual conference.","Luigi Mangione, 26, was arrested Monday in Altoona, Pennsylvania, in connection with the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Trump has a new favorite foreign leader. He's known as 'the Madman.',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/javier-milei-trump-has-a-new-favorite-foreign-leader-hes-known-as-the-madman-/articleshow/116154263.cms,"President Javier Milei of Argentina, a hard-right politician, speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Javier Milei , the wild-haired Argentine president known by his supporters as ""the madman,"" has lately edged out Hungary's Viktor Orban as the MAGA movement 's chief international inspiration. Donald Trump has called Milei his ""favorite president,"" and Milei was the first foreign leader to visit him at Mar-a-Lago after his victory. Last week, the Conservative Political Action Conference , which has increasingly sought to build a global network of right-wing activists and politicians, held its first-ever conference in Buenos Aires. Lara Trump, the president-elect's daughter-in-law, gave a speech lauding Milei's relentless budget-slashing and vowed that, with help from Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy's Department of Government Efficiency, ""we're going to do the same thing in the United States.""The ascendence of Milei in Trumpworld is a sign of an important ideological shift on the right. Trump first ran for office railing against corporate America and rejecting the sort of entitlement cuts long dreamed of by Republican wonks like Paul Ryan, the former House speaker. ""I'm not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican, and I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid,"" Trump said in 2015. After Trump won, Orban became an icon to a group of rising right-wing intellectuals less interested in fiscal discipline than in using the power of the state to remake culture, reward friends and punish enemies. Conservatives like JD Vance often speak admiringly of the subsidies Orban's government gives families to encourage them to have more children; such spending is more than 5% of Hungary's gross domestic product.Milei is a very different kind of right-winger. He's an arch-libertarian -- except when it comes to abortion -- who has four cloned mastiffs named after conservative economists. He believes that drugs should be legal, as should the sale of organs, and sees marriage as a contract that should exist outside of state regulation.Since taking office a year ago amid devastating hyperinflation, he's undertaken a campaign of economic shock therapy, slashing government spending by around 30%. In doing so, as Jon Lee Anderson wrote in a recent New Yorker profile, he's changed ""the compact between the Argentinian state and its citizens -- cutting cost-of-living increases to pensioners, funding for education, and supplies for soup kitchens in poor neighborhoods."" In some ways, Milei is succeeding; inflation has plummeted. But the poverty rate rose by around 11 points during his first six months in office, to almost 53%, and the country has fallen into a recession.In the American right's admiration for Milei, you can see the rebirth of old-fashioned small-government conservatism in feral tech-bro form. Campaigning for Trump in October, Musk argued that Americans need to accept ""temporary hardship"" to reduce spending, and Ramaswamy recently called for ""Milei-style cuts on steroids."" It's far from clear how much policy influence Musk and Ramaswamy will actually have; the Department of Government Efficiency is just an advisory board, not a real department. But while Paul Ryan may be banished from Trump's Republican Party, some of the most unattractive elements of his politics have come roaring back.Mike Lee, R-Utah, has long dreamed of pulling up Social Security ""by the roots."" In social media posts last week, he compared it to a ""Ponzi scheme"" and called for ""real reform."" ""Interesting thread,"" wrote Musk, boosting it. On Fox Business Network, Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., said legislators need to have the ""stomach"" to make ""hard decisions"" about entitlements, while his fellow congressional Republican, Mark Alford, called for raising the Social Security retirement age.At least in the immediate term, both Social Security and Medicare are probably safe, given the minuscule size of the House Republican majority. Plenty of other programs could, however, be on the chopping block.A Republican Congress may cut federal matching funds that helped states expand access to Medicaid, which covers low-income people and people with disabilities. Republicans are talking about imposing national Medicaid work requirements and checking recipient eligibility more than once a year, potentially burdening people with more paperwork than they can keep up with. The GOP is also looking at ways to cut food stamps and to make it harder to qualify for them. Affordable housing programs could be gutted, and Trump will probably roll back what he can of Biden's student debt relief programs. New hardships, for many, may well be on the way. It remains to be seen how temporary they will be.For years, observers, including me, have attributed at least part of Trump's success to his rhetorical break with the unpopular elements of conservative economic orthodoxy. His choice of Vance as vice president suggested he might be open to an expansion of the social safety net aimed at shoring up blue-collar families. But the American right's lionization of Milei indicates a different Republican path, one more congenial to the party's biggest donors.Milei, with his defiantly vulgar, anarchically anti-establishment style, has managed to build a working-class constituency for economic austerity and to maintain it even as his policies start to bite. (His approval rating is a relatively robust 55%.) He's figured out a way to harness the insurrectionary energy of populism to the most elite economic program imaginable. This feat, such as it is, may not be replicable outside of Argentina, but it's understandable that our plutocrats would want to try.","Javier Milei, Argentina's president, has emerged as the MAGA movement's chief international inspiration.

Luigi Mangione arrest: How unmasked photos and McDonald's tip lead to breakthrough in UnitedHealthcare CEO’s murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/luigi-mangione-arrest-how-unmasked-photos-and-mcdonalds-tip-lead-to-breakthrough-in-unitedhealthcare-ceos-murder/articleshow/116153908.cms,"These photos, taken from above, showed the man’s face clearly. One picture captured him smiling, while the other showed him with a straight expression. These images were quickly disseminated to the public, and tips flooded in.

The hunt for the shooter

The crucial tip

The role of surveillance and public vigilance

In a dramatic twist of fate, it wasn't cutting-edge facial recognition software that led the police to a suspect in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealth executive Brian Thompson last week in Midtown Manhattan, but rather a few key photographs and the sharp eyes of a McDonald's employee hundreds of miles away.The investigation, which spanned five intense days, culminated on Monday morning when Luigi Mangione, 26, of Maryland, was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania. The breakthrough came from two crucial images of the suspect taken at a New York hostel, just one day after the killing. While police had access to a wealth of forensic evidence and hours of surveillance footage, it was these photographs—captured when the suspect briefly lowered his mask— that provided the crucial lead.Brian Thompson was shot dead outside a Midtown hotel on Wednesday, triggering a city-wide search for the killer. Despite the NYPD's use of an extensive network of surveillance cameras, forensic evidence, and facial recognition technology, the suspect's face remained hidden in nearly every frame. The man had worn a balaclava to conceal his identity and appeared in several videos—from a bike ride to a coffee shop and even a taxi ride—but all with his face covered.It wasn't until the suspect lowered his mask during a brief interaction with a hostel clerk that investigators caught their first real glimpse of him. Two distinct images captured his face clearly—one with a smile, the other with a serious expression. These photos were quickly shared with the public, prompting numerous tips from citizens who had seen something suspicious.The breakthrough came from an unlikely source: a fast-food worker in Altoona, Pennsylvania. While working a shift at a local McDonald's, the employee recognized Mangione from the photos circulating in the media. The worker called the police, who acted quickly, detaining Mangione at the restaurant and finding him in possession of a firearm, a silencer, and what authorities described as a ""manifesto.""NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny credited the release of the photo to the media as the pivotal moment in solving the case. ""It was that specific photograph that ultimately led to the arrest,"" he said, underscoring the power of public awareness in modern investigations.The case highlights the delicate balance between technology and public involvement in law enforcement efforts. While New York City's surveillance system—one of the most advanced in the U.S.—provided critical footage, it was the public’s ability to recognize a face that brought the investigation to its resolution.""This photo has been seen more times than in your average homicide,"" said Sean Patrick Griffin, a criminal justice professor. He pointed out that the distinct features of the suspect, including dark eyebrows, high cheekbones, and a wide smile, made him easily identifiable. ""When you're trying to escape a crime like this, those features can be a liability.""","Brian Thompson was shot dead outside a Midtown hotel on Wednesday, triggering a city-wide search for the killer.

How Jordan Neely's father and other family reacted?



Protest erupts after verdict



What judge said in this?



A 26-year-old man Daniel Penny has been found not guilty of putting an unarmed homeless man Jordan Neely in a fatal chokehold, an incident that sparked nationwide discussions about issues including homelessness, mental health care, public safety, and racial relations.After five days and over 24 hours of deliberation, the jury reached their decision.Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg acknowledged the jury's thorough consideration: ""The jury carefully deliberated for four days. They requested readbacks of testimony and asked for video footage to re-watch, as well as written definitions of the law. Their lengthy deliberation – and the totality of the facts and the evidence – underscored why this case was put in front of a jury of Penny's peers.""The verdict announcement prompted mixed reactions in court. Andre Zachery, Neely's father, expressed anger and was escorted out. Some attendees shouted, while another wept openly, ABC news reported.Outside the courthouse, Zachery expressed his grief and disappointment: ""I just want to say I miss my son. My son didn't have to go through this. I didn't have to go through this either. It hurts. It really, really hurts,"" he stated alongside supporters. ""I had enough of this, the system is rigged.""The family's attorney, Donte Mills, indicated their intention to pursue civil action: ""I promised this family justice – we are still going to do that,"" he stated. ""The district attorney did a good job, but the jury in this case let us down.""Gwen Carr, mother of Eric Garner who died in a similar incident, expressed concern about the recurring nature of such events: ""No one deserves to be choked,"" she stated. ""You know, we're in that courtroom, and people are cheering for the verdict.""Penny displayed a brief smile before resuming a neutral expression. His legal team celebrated quietly at their table.The protest erupted outside the court after the verdict and chanted ""Say his name – Jordan Neely"" and ""No justice, no peace"" as authorities dispersed the gathering.In May 2023, Penny, a 25-year-old ex-Marine, restrained Neely, a 30-year-old homeless individual, in a prolonged chokehold on an uptown F train at Second Avenue. Witnesses reported that Neely was exhibiting erratic behaviour and shouting before the incident occurred.The jury deliberated on the criminally negligent homicide charge after Judge Maxwell Wiley dismissed the more serious manslaughter charge on Friday. The latter carried a maximum 15-year sentence, while the former has a four-year maximum. Neither offence has a minimum sentence requirement.Prosecutors contended that Penny caused Neely's death through a six-minute chokehold, maintaining it for 51 seconds after Neely became unresponsive. The prosecution argued Penny was aware of the potential fatal consequences but continued regardless.While the medical examiner attributed Neely's death to the chokehold, the defence suggested it resulted from a genetic condition and synthetic marijuana use. Defence lawyer Steven Raiser portrayed Penny's actions as protective measures for other passengers against what he described as Neely's threatening behaviour.The court rejected a defence motion for mistrial on Monday morning, which argued that dismissing the manslaughter charge would influence the jury's decision.","Daniel Penny, 26, found not guilty of putting unarmed homeless man Jordan Neely in fatal chokehold.

The capture: A tipster’s quick thinking

A calculated attack

From valedictorian to fugitive

Corporate fallout

A chilling breakthrough in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson came from an unexpected place—a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Police arrested 26-year-old Luigi Nicholas Mangione on Monday after a restaurant employee recognized him and alerted authorities.Mangione was found with a ghost gun , a mask resembling the one worn by the shooter, and writings expressing deep resentment toward corporate America, police said. The gun is believed to be the same one used in the brazen Manhattan killing last week, which rocked the health insurance industry and raised concerns about executive security.Mangione was eating breakfast when Altoona police arrived. Along with the weapon, officers recovered fraudulent IDs, a US passport, and a suppressor linked to the murder weapon. “This individual is believed to be the person responsible for the deliberate and targeted killing of Brian Thompson,” NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.The writings found in Mangione’s possession offered a disturbing glimpse into his mindset. A three-page manifesto revealed “ill will toward corporate America,” NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said, providing investigators with critical insight into the possible motive.Thompson, 50, was ambushed last Wednesday while walking to his hotel, where UnitedHealth Group was holding its annual investor conference. The shooter waited in hiding before firing at Thompson with a 9 mm ghost gun, a weapon assembled from untraceable parts.Evidence left in the aftermath painted a chilling picture: surveillance footage showed the masked shooter ditching a backpack in Central Park, abandoning a bike, and boarding a taxi to the George Washington Bridge Bus Station. Items recovered from the crime scene included ammunition marked with the words “delay,” “deny,” and “depose”—a grim reference to criticism of insurance practices.Mangione’s background added another layer of intrigue. A valedictorian of a prestigious Baltimore prep school and a University of Pennsylvania graduate with degrees in computer science, his life took a dark turn. Investigators linked him to addresses from Hawaii to San Francisco, and police blocked off a family property in Maryland on Monday.Photos released by the NYPD, including footage of the suspect unmasked at a Starbucks before the attack, helped generate critical tips. Law enforcement credited media coverage and the tipster’s vigilance for leading to the arrest.The high-profile killing has shaken corporate America, prompting companies to reassess security for executives and scrub personal information from websites.UnitedHealth Group released a statement following Mangione’s arrest: “We hope this brings some relief to Brian’s family, friends, and colleagues during this difficult time.”As Mangione awaits extradition to New York, the case has left lasting ripples—not only in the health insurance industry but in the uneasy intersection of public safety and corporate power.","Luigi Nicholas Mangione, 26, was arrested at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania.

Manhattan jury's acquittal of Daniel Penny in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely has left Neely's legal team grappling with the next steps. The high-profile case, which reignited debates over mental health, crime, and race, has now shifted to the question: What legal recourse remains for Neely's advocates?With the criminal trial concluded, Neely's lawyers may focus on filing a civil lawsuit. Unlike a criminal case, a civil suit would not aim for incarceration but instead seek financial damages or a declaration of wrongdoing. Civil cases operate on a lower burden of proof—requiring only a ""preponderance of evidence"" rather than ""beyond a reasonable doubt.""This option could provide Neely's family with a sense of justice and potentially highlight systemic failures that led to his tragic death.While criminal acquittals cannot typically be retried due to double jeopardy protections, Neely's lawyers could explore the possibility of appealing procedural issues from the trial. If they believe the court erred in admitting or excluding evidence, or if juror conduct was questionable, an appeal might be pursued to challenge the fairness of the process.Beyond the courtroom, Neely’s legal team and supporters may amplify public pressure to address broader issues raised by his death. Advocates could push for reforms in mental health services, subway safety protocols, or policies governing the use of force by civilians.The defense argued Penny acted in self-defense, claiming Neely, who was homeless and experiencing a mental health crisis, posed a threat to passengers. The jury was persuaded by the defense's narrative that Neely's erratic behavior was frightening and justified Penny's actions. Video evidence and testimony played pivotal roles, but the dismissal of the manslaughter charge after a deadlocked jury likely sealed Penny’s fate.Prosecutors countered that Penny's chokehold was excessive and reckless, with Neely immobilized for nearly a minute before his death. The medical examiner's report confirmed the chokehold caused Neely's death, but the defense pointed to other factors, including a genetic condition and synthetic marijuana in Neely’s system, as contributing causes.As Penny walks free, Neely’s name is set to remain central to discussions about justice and accountability in a divided city. Whether through a civil suit or broader advocacy, Neely’s legal team is unlikely to let this case fade quietly. The outcome may serve as a catalyst for change—or yet another chapter in an ongoing debate about crime, race, and mental health in America.","Daniel Penny was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely.

Biden administration

pledges action

Years of frustration and hope

The United States is accelerating its effort to find and secure the release of Austin Tice , an American journalist abducted in Syria 12 years ago.Roger Carstens , the US special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, travelled to Beirut as part of the ongoing mission to gather information on Tice’s whereabouts. State Department officials confirmed that these efforts have intensified following the recent overthrow of Bashar al-Assad's government.State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller emphasised the importance of this operation, stating, “We are ready to engage with any organisation that might have information about the whereabouts of Austin Tice.” He reiterated the US government's commitment, noting, “We will not rest until he is returned home safely to his loved ones.”Tice, a freelance photojournalist working for outlets such asand CBS, was detained at a checkpoint near Damascus on August 14, 2012.In a video released weeks later, he appeared blindfolded and surrounded by armed men, but the identity of his captors has remained unknown. Syria has consistently denied holding him.President Joe Biden underscored the urgency of the mission, saying on Sunday, “The US government believes Austin Tice is alive. We think we can get him back, but we have no direct evidence of that yet.” Biden also called for anyone with credible information to assist in the effort.Austin Tice’s parents, Marc and Debra Tice, remain hopeful. In a recent statement, they shared, “Austin Tice is alive, in Syria, and it’s time for him to come home. We are eagerly anticipating seeing Austin walk free and are asking anyone who can assist to please do so”, reported the news agency Reuters.Efforts to secure Tice’s release have been fraught with difficulty.According to Reuters, US intelligence received over the summer from a Lebanese source suggested that Tice was alive and possibly held by a group linked to Hezbollah . However, determining the accuracy of such reports has been challenging.Carstens’ visit to Lebanon aims to renew hope, as secretary of state Antony Blinken noted during a recent event, “With every party we engage, we’ll continue to seek information about Austin Tice so that we can find him and bring him home to his family and loved ones.”A $1 million FBI reward for information leading to Tice’s safe return remains active, further reflecting the US government’s commitment to resolving the case.","U.S. State Department officials confirmed that these efforts have intensified following the recent overthrow of Bashar al-Assad's government.

Academic aspirations at Penn

Luigi Mangione , at the centre of a high-profile investigation into the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson , was once celebrated as the valedictorian of his 2016 graduating class at The Gilman School , a prestigious institution in North Baltimore.A video from Mangione’s speech at the Gilman Founder’s Day Ceremony has recently resurfaced, gaining viral attention. In his speech, he can be heard expressing plans to study AI at the University of Pennsylvania.As per the Baltimore Banner, Mangione was recognised as a bright and inventive student with the courage to explore uncharted territories during his time at school.School officials praised him during the 2016 graduation ceremonies for embodying creativity and dedication.He also made an impact outside the classroom, referencing cherished moments such as participating in the school production of ‘The Addams Family’ and celebrating football victories against rival McDonough during his speech at the Gilman Founder’s Day Ceremony.Mangione carried his ambition to the University of Pennsylvania, where he pursued engineering with a focus on computer science.Inspired by his early fascination with independent video games, he not only honed his programming skills but also founded a student club that developed video games.Speaking to Penn Today, Mangione explained his passion: “In high school, I started playing a lot of independent games and stuff like that, but I wanted to make my own game, and so I learned how to code.” His initiative and dedication earned him recognition within the university community.According to The Baltimore Banner, the recent news about Mangione has left his alma mater in shock. Henry P A Smyth, Head of School at Gilman, expressed his dismay in an email to the school community, stating, “This is deeply distressing news on top of an already awful situation. Our hearts go out to everyone affected.”Now, Mangione finds himself at the centre of a criminal investigation , named as a person of interest in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.Authorities revealed that he was arrested in possession of a manifesto , a ghost gun , and multiple fake IDs, raising questions about how a once-promising valedictorian's journey took such a dark turn.","Luigi Mangione was the valedictorian of his 2016 graduating class at The Gilman School in North Baltimore.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world in Oct, revealed data shared by Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index on Monday.Since Mid-July, internet users in Pakistan have reported frequent slowdowns and persistent connectivity challenges in the country, causing widespread disruptions to browsing and media sharing.The global index placed Pakistan at 100 out of 111 countries in mobile internet speeds, and 141 out of 158 countries in broadband speeds.The country’s regular internet interruptions were accompanied by reports of restricted access to virtual private networks (VPNs), which many Pakistanis use to access X and other restricted websites.According to the World Population Review, which analysed data from Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index and Cable, Pakistan’s average download speed was 7.85 MBPS, with a median mobile download speed of 19.59 MBPS and a median broadband download speed of 15.52 MBPS.Internet service providers and the business community blamed the slump in services on the govt’s installation of a Chinese-built national internet firewall, a combination of hardware and software used by authorities to control and monitor internet traffic, acting as a digital gatekeeper that decides what data to allow or block.The national firewall, also being installed on servers of major internet providers, has the capability to detect and slow digital communication between individual users.Last month, Pakistan home ministry had sought a ban on unregulated use of VPNs, citing their use by terrorists to “facilitate violent activities” and to “access pornographic and blasphemous content”.“VPNs are increasingly being exploited by terrorists to facilitate violent activities and financial transactions in Pakistan,” the ministry said in a letter to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).","Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world.

"Pakistan's ISI pushes drug addicts as terror couriers in Indian jails, say officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-isi-pushes-drug-addicts-as-terror-couriers-in-indian-jails-say-officials/articleshow/116116037.cms,"During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India to utilise them to deliver critical messages to hardcore terrorists incarcerated in the country's prisons. Officials said that more than 10 such cases have been reported since July this year in which Pakistani nationals have entered India from their country and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Many of them have been sent to prisons in Jammu, Punjab and Rajasthan.The officials said security agencies suspect these individuals are Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) couriers tasked with relaying important communication to the jailed terrorists wherever possible.Interrogation of these individuals typically shows that they have been trained in resistance techniques to withstand questioning by security personnel.The behaviour displayed by those apprehended has raised suspicions among officials, who suggest that their superficial details and evasive responses indicate a potentially larger agenda behind their infiltration, possibly stemming from the fear of repercussions from their handlers.They explained that the use of mobile phones and the internet leaves behind electronic footprints that could expose the plans of both state and non-state actors operating across the border. As a result, the ISI has adopted this new modus operandi.The infiltration strategy reportedly includes women and minors, who may also serve as couriers. In a notable incident in July, a minor from Pakistan's Attock was intercepted in Punjab.During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said.The ISI's infiltration tactics have been linked to drug smuggling operations. In one case from Bijnour village in Rajasthan, a Pakistani national posing as mentally disturbed finally spilled the beans during intense questioning that he had been hired by two drug lords in Pakistan -- Sarfaraz Johiya and Nawaz -- to facilitate narcotics trafficking into India and gather information on the deployment of Border Security Force (BSF) troops.In another recent incident, a Pakistani youth named Mohammed Asad from Lahore drove to the zero line on his motorcycle and seemingly awaited arrest by the BSF. During interrogation, he claimed to have had a family dispute over his girlfriend.The officials noted that Asad, who was subsequently moved to prison, may have been acting as a courier. Security agencies have requested additional custody for extended interrogation.In October, a 31-year-old man who identified himself as Shahid Imran entered India through the Jammu sector, claiming that he wanted to visit a Kali temple to get married.The officials explained that such infiltrators are generally booked under the Foreigners Act and Passports Act, for which the punishment ranges from two years to eight years in prison and following this, they are deported.They said that in the late-1990s and early-2000s, ISI exploited the Samjhauta Express, the rail link between India and Pakistan, for covert courier operations, employing individuals known as ""sawari operators"".This service continued until February 2019, when the train service was halted.The ""sawari operators"" played a crucial role in smuggling drugs and transporting funds intended to finance terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as Punjab.However, following a significant crackdown by authorities, these operations were effectively curtailed, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of numerous individuals involved in such activities.Recent developments suggest that the ISI's current method of sending couriers mirrors these past tactics.The officials said that the infiltration strategies being employed now are reminiscent of the past, as the agency seeks new ways to bypass law enforcement and deliver crucial communication and resources across the border.","Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries.

Growing threat from Baloch separatists

Sectarian violence fuels instability

Border tensions and counterterrorism efforts

What lies ahead

Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month, according to a report by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks in November, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths. These figures surpassed the fatalities caused by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), indicating a shift in the BLA's operational strategy. Experts suggest this escalation requires a reassessment of counterterrorism tactics.The majority of these attacks in Balochistan targeted security forces and civilians. Notable incidents included an assault on the Quetta railway station, an attack on a police van in Mastung, and a strike on a security check-post in Kalat, which collectively accounted for 91% of the province’s fatalities.Sectarian violence added another layer to the country's security challenges, particularly in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Seven incidents, including two terror attacks and five sectarian clashes, claimed 115 lives and left 137 injured. The violence was triggered by an attack on passenger buses on November 21, which spiraled into broader sectarian unrest.KP remained the most affected province, with 41 terrorist attacks leading to 114 deaths and 95 injuries. The TTP, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, and other local factions were linked to most of these incidents.The report also highlighted six incidents of border violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, resulting in 25 terrorist deaths and 11 injuries. This underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges posed by cross-border insurgents.Security forces conducted 19 counterterrorism operations in November, killing 53 terrorists. Most of these operations were concentrated in KP and Balochistan, the epicenters of recent violence.The PIPS report paints a grim picture of Pakistan's security landscape, with 98 conflict-related incidents causing 338 deaths and 411 injuries in November alone. Experts suggest that the evolving nature of terror threats, including the increasing lethality of BLA operations and persistent sectarian tensions, requires urgent and innovative policy responses.As Pakistan grapples with these challenges, the question remains: can the state adapt quickly enough to address the multifaceted threats destabilizing the country?","Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month.

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistan anti-terrorism court indicted on Thursday former prime minister Imran Khan along with dozens of other Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) politicians on charges of inciting supporters to attack the country’s military installations on May 9, 2023.Following Khan’s arrest on May 9 last year, his supporters had attacked and torched several military buildings and offices to protest against what they describe as the illegal detention of their leader. At least eight people were killed in the violence that followed Khan’s arrest on alleged graft charges.Khan pleaded not guilty to the charges while the court also indicted more than 60 others, including opposition leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub, in the same case linked to the attack on the army’s General Headquarters (GHQ) in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. In addition, the court has ordered that detained former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi , currently in Lahore jail, be produced in court.The court also ordered the arrests of several PTI politicians, including Ali Amin Gandapur, chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where Khan’s party has been in govt.

In a virtual address to a gathering of overseas Awami League supporters in London on Sunday, Hasina accused Yunus of being the ""mastermind"" behind the July-August turmoil that ousted her government and vowed to bring him and his allies to justice under Bangladeshi law.She criticized Yunus and his interim government for their alleged persecution of religious minorities in Bangladesh.""Since August 5, the attacks on minorities, places of worship of Hindus, Christians and Buddhists have been rampant. We condemn it. The Jamaat and terrorists are having a free run under the new regime,"" she said.The audio recording of Hasina's address was shared on the Facebook page of the Bangladesh Students' League and Bangladesh Awami League.Her remarks came ahead of Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri's visit to Dhaka Monday where he raised India's concerns over the safety of minorities, flagging ""regrettable incidents of attacks on cultural, religious and diplomatic properties"" in the country.There have been a spate of incidents of violence against Hindus and other minorities, as well as attacks on temples in Bangladesh in the last few weeks that triggered strong concerns in New Delhi.""Bangladesh is now under the grip of a fascist regime where people's democratic rights have been obliterated. Our government's achievements in poverty alleviation and infrastructure development, strengthening of democracy were being undone under Yunus's leadership,"" Hasina said during her 37-minute virtual address over the phone.Hasina accused the Yunus government of providing clemency to terrorists and criminals, including those involved in arson and murders.""The release of convicted criminals and terrorists, including those responsible for attacks on the Bangladesh Parliament and other atrocities, proves the complicity of this government,"" she alleged.Hasina vowed that those responsible for the alleged atrocities under the Yunus administration would be brought to justice.""Md Yunus and his allies are the masterminds of the July-August unrest in the country. They are behind the killing of students and policemen, arson and atrocities. The murderers and conspirators who have harmed our nation will be held accountable under Bangladeshi law.

This government is using every tool to suppress dissent and deny justice,"" she said.Chinmay Krishna Das, a prominent spokesperson for Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote, was arrested at Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday while en route to Chattogram for a rally. He was denied bail and remanded to jail on Tuesday.

The rule of law has been completely eroded,"" she said, calling for accountability and justice.Hasina claimed that the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has ignored allegations of financial irregularities involving Yunus and his organization, Grameen Bank.""They accuse my government of corruption but fail to provide evidence. Meanwhile, Yunus's activities remain unchecked by the ACC,"" she said, reiterating her challenge for the interim government to substantiate its allegations against her.Hasina claimed that since August, more than a thousand leaders and workers of the Awami League have been killed, their homes looted, and their businesses destroyed.She claimed that members of her party were being systematically targeted and that these incidents were part of a broader conspiracy to eliminate the Awami League's influence.""All units of the Awami League have been subjected to attacks. The homes and businesses of our leaders have been looted.

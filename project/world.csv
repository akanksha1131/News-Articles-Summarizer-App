What is a travel ban?



What is a presidential proclamation?



Ban go into effect from Monday



Is a rollback on the table?



Countries under full restriction



(As per statements released by White House)

Afghanistan - ""The Taliban, a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) group, controls Afghanistan. Afghanistan lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.""

Myanmar ( Burma ) - ""According to the Overstay Report , Burma had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 27.07 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 42.17 percent. Additionally, Burma has historically not cooperated with the United States to accept back their removable nationals.""

Chad - ""According to the Overstay Report, Chad had a B‑1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 49.54 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 55.64 percent. According to the Fiscal Year 2022 Overstay Report, Chad had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 37.12 percent. The high visa overstay rate for 2022 and 2023 is unacceptable and indicates a blatant disregard for United States immigration laws.""

Republic of the Congo - ""According to the Overstay Report, the Republic of the Congo had a B-1/B-2 visa overstay rate of 29.63 percent and an F, M, and J visa overstay rate of 35.14 percent.""

Equatorial Guinea - Recorded a 21.98% overstay rate for B1/B2 visas and 70.18% for student/exchange visas.

Eritrea - ""The United States questions the competence of the central authority for issuance of passports or civil documents in Eritrea. Criminal records are not available to the United States for Eritrean nationals.""

Haiti - ""Hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden Administration. This influx harms American communities by creating acute risks of increased overstay rates, establishment of criminal networks, and other national security threats.""

Iran - ""Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism . Iran regularly fails to cooperate with the United States Government in identifying security risks, is the source of significant terrorism around the world, and has historically failed to accept back its removable nationals.""

Libya - ""There is no competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents in Libya. The historical terrorist presence within Libya’s territory amplifies the risks posed by the entry into the United States of its nationals.""

Somalia - "" Somalia lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.""

Sudan - ""Sudan lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.""

Yemen - ""Yemen lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.""

Countries under partial restriction



Burundi

Cuba

Laos

Sierra Leone

Togo

Turkmenistan

Venezuela

Why were these countries chosen?



Lack of document integrity & vetting systems: Nations like Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Libya, and Venezuela are cited for lacking competent or cooperative authorities to issue credible documents or vet travellers.

High visa overstay rates: Burma, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Burundi, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, and Turkmenistan were flagged for significantly high rates of visa overstays in the US.

Terrorist threats and state-sponsored terrorism: Countries such as Iran, Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya, Cuba, and others were included due to their ties to terrorism or designation as state sponsors of terrorism.





Exemptions for Olympics, World Cups







Six months into his presidency, US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a far-reaching travel ban, saying, ""we don't want them."" This travel ban, impacting a total of 19 countries, can majorly reshape immigration policy of the United States.It was put forth through a presidential proclamation, the proposed restrictions introduce a three-tiered system of escalating barriers targeting nationals from more than a dozen countries.The measure is among the most aggressive in modern US history regarding global mobility. It has the potential to impact millions of people seeking entry to the United States for purposes including work, study, tourism, and relocation.Trump's latest decision on travel ban came days after Egyptian national was arrested for attacking a Jewish protest in Colorado's Boulder.In a video message, he said the Boulder incident revealed the dangers posed by unvetted foreign nationals and visa overstayers. ""The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted,"" Trump said.""We don't want them.""A travel ban is a government-imposed restriction that prohibits or limits entry to the United States for citizens of specific countries. These restrictions may include total visa suspensions or targeted limitations on certain visa categories.Trump’s first executive order directed the State Department to identify nations where vetting procedures are inadequate, potentially justifying a full or partial suspension of entry for their nationals.The current proclamation builds on that order and cites a recent attack by an Egyptian national in Colorado's Boulder as additional justification.A presidential proclamation is a formal announcement by the President. While some proclamations are ceremonial, others --especially during national emergencies, can carry legal and policy weight.Unlike executive orders that direct federal agencies, proclamations often signal sweeping policy shifts.In this case, the White House said, “The Proclamation fully restricts and limits the entry of nationals from 12 countries found to be deficient with regard to screening and vetting and determined to pose a very high risk to the United States.”As per the White House's statement travel ban announced by Trump administration will go into effect from Monday.Trump added the latest travel ban was shaped by “foreign policy, national security, and counterterrorism goals.”He said the list of restricted countries could change, adding it was “subject to revisions based on whether material improvements are made,” and “new countries could be added as threats emerge around the world.”On the campaign trail last year, Trump had pledged, “I will ban refugee resettlement from terror-infested areas like the Gaza Strip… Remember the famous travel ban?... We’re not taking them from infested countries.”The proclamation also imposes partial restrictions on citizens from seven additional countries identified as posing elevated risks:The proclamation outlines various justifications for including these countries:The travel ban will not apply to athletes participating in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico, or the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, according to Trump’s order.","US President Donald Trump announced a far-reaching travel ban on Wednesday.

What we know about Soliman's family







A Biden administration-appointed federal judge in Colorado has halted the deportation of the Boulder firebombing incident suspect's family members, including his five children.Mohamed Soliman, an Egyptian national who stayed illegally in the US even after his visa expired, was arrested on Sunday for firebombing a Jewish gathering in Colorado.US District Judge Gordon P Gallagher issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) that prevents immigration authorities from removing Soliman's wife, Hayem El Gamal, and their children from Colorado or the United States, Fox News reported.""Defendants are temporarily restrained and enjoined from removing Hayem El Gamal and her five minor children from the State of Colorado or the United States,"" stated Gallagher's order, which remains effective until June 13.The ruling followed an emergency request from El Gamal's friend, Susanna Dvortsin, who sought legal protection for the family. Dvortsin contended that the family faced immediate deportation without proper legal proceedings. Judge Gallagher concurred, noting potential ""irreparable harm"" from deportation.A hearing is scheduled for June 13 at Denver's Byron G. Rogers Courthouse.Sources informed Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin that while El Gamal and her children have exceeded their visa duration, Soliman had previously filed an asylum application for them.Soliman's daughter graduated from Thomas Maclaren State Charter School in Colorado Springs. According to reports, she came to the US with her father two years ago and is also probably an illegal alien. Trump-aide Laura Loomer said that a Colorado newspaper did a profile piece on his daughter, Habiba Soliman, for attending the school in hijab.According to the article, she described in her scholarship application how her family had immigrated to the US after living in Kuwait, noting that her father had undergone a “difficult surgery” when she was young “that restored his ability to walk.” The girl said the incident inspired her to pursue medical school – a dream that would have been impossible in Kuwait but within reach in America.During the investigation, Soliman revealed that he wanted to kill all Zionists and would do again. He planned the attack on the Jewish group that assembled every Sunday demanding the release of the Israelis in Gaza, but waited for her daughter's graduation.Police said after Soliman's arrest, his family members cooperated with the investigation. They were not privy to Soliman's plan.","Mohamed Soliman, an Egyptian national who stayed illegally in the US even after his visa expired, was arrested on Sunday for firebombing a Jewish gathering in Colorado.

The US administration led by President Donald Trump has intensified its conflict with Columbia University, stating that the institution fails to meet accreditation criteria due to inadequate protection of Jewish students.""After Hamas' October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel, Columbia University's leadership acted with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students on its campus,"" stated US Secretary of Education Linda McMahon on Wednesday.The Office for Civil Rights at the US Department of Education announced Wednesday that it had informed the Middle States Commission on Higher Education about Columbia University's alleged Title VI Civil Rights Act violation, as per an Education Department release. ""The US Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) today notified Middle States Commission on Higher Education (the Commission) that its member institution, Columbia University, is in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws and therefore fails to meet the standards for accreditation set by the Commission,"" stated the release.The federal body claimed that the university appears to no longer satisfy the commission's accreditation requirements.The comes as the US government escalates its scrutiny of elite academic institutions regarding allegations of widespread antisemitism and progressive prejudice.According to Columbia's website, accreditation, administered by non-profit organisations, is essential for university students to access federal funding, including grants and loans. ""We look forward to the Commission keeping the Department fully informed of actions taken to ensure Columbia's compliance with accreditation standards including compliance with federal civil rights laws,"" McMahon added to her statement.The Middle States Commission on Higher Education acknowledged, to CNN, the receipt of Wednesday's letter.Columbia faced accusations last month of breaching federal civil rights law through ""deliberate indifference"" to Jewish student harassment since October 7, 2023, corresponding with Hamas's attack and Israel's subsequent military response in Gaza.A Columbia representative characterised these findings as progression in their collaborative efforts with the government to address antisemitism on campus.This forms part of the federal government's Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism initiatives, established following Trump's February executive order.Trump further addressed college accreditation through an April executive order, directing the education secretary to ensure accreditors' accountability through various measures for poor performance or Civil Rights Act violations, as detailed by a White House official to CNN.The Education Department confirmed Wednesday its responsibility to inform accreditors about member institutions' non-compliance findings, in accordance with Trump's executive order.Leading US universities, including Columbia, face substantial pressure from the administration to implement policy changes or risk losing federal support.In March, Columbia implemented comprehensive policy changes after the administration threatened to withdraw $400 million in grants and contracts over alleged insufficient action against campus antisemitism.","US Department of Education says Columbia University fails to meet accreditation criteria due to inadequate protection of Jewish students.

Jonathan Joss killed in hate crime? Husband claims killer used slur as actor lay dying,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jonathan-joss-killed-in-hate-crime-husband-claims-killer-used-slur-as-actor-lay-dying/articleshow/121626634.cms,"Jonathan Joss

Joto'





The husband of murdered King of the Hill actor Jonathan Joss says the man who shot him stood over the dying star, laughed, and delivered a slur.Joss, 59, was gunned down Sunday night near his home in San Antonio, Texas, in what his spouse, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, believes was a hate-motivated attack by a homophobic neighbor after years of harassment.“Everything was really close range. It was in the head,” Kern de Gonzales told The Independent. “I held his face together while I told him how much I loved him. He could still hear me… I could tell he was trying to say, ‘I love you.’”Kern de Gonzales claimed that the killers words while Joss was dying included homophobic slur. During the confrontation, he recounted the assailant's threatening behaviour while holding him at gunpoint. The attacker mockingly said, ""'Oh, you love him? Joto,'"" as per Kern de Gonzales's account. He further clarified, ""'is Spanish for f****t. I never knew the word until I came to Texas, and then I heard it a lot.""The accused shooter, identified as 52-year-old Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, was arrested near the scene and has been charged with first-degree murder. According to the San Antonio Police Department (SAPD), Ceja admitted to the shooting, stating simply, “I shot him.”However, in a statement released Monday, SAPD said investigators had found “no evidence to indicate that… Mr.Joss' murder was related to his sexual orientation.” “We take such allegations very seriously and have thoroughly reviewed all available information,” the department added. “Should any new evidence come to light, we will charge the suspect accordingly.”Read more: Jonathan Joss was not murdered because he was gay, says San Antonio police, refuting husband's claim Additionally, SAPD records claim officers responded to more than 40 calls involving Joss in 2024, ranging from welfare checks to mental health concerns and neighbor disputes. Still, Kern de Gonzales insists his husband was not violent- only outspoken.Kern de Gonzales, identifying as transgender man, strongly disputed the department’s stance. He alleged the couple had endured years of targeted hostility from Ceja, and says their repeated complaints were ignored by law enforcement. “They ignored us, refused to file police reports for about two years [over the couple’s complaints of harassment], and now they're trying to say it wasn't a hate crime,” he told The Independent. “It's like when the police investigate themselves and find they did nothing wrong.”He also pointed to earlier, deeply unsettling events involving the suspect- including discovering their deceased dog's skull near their mailbox following a house fire this past winter. That detail does not appear in the SAPD incident report.According to Kern de Gonzales, the fatal confrontation began after Joss shouted at Ceja. The couple had stepped outside to check the mail when the alleged gunman approached with a weapon. “I don’t care if me and my husband were walking around with one pitchfork in our hand and another pitchfork up our a**, we didn’t point any weapons at anybody,” he said. “When the man rolled up with the gun, we were checking the mail.”Joss, who was of Native American descent, was best known for voicing John Redcorn on the long-running animated series King of the Hill. Beyond his work in entertainment, his husband says he was deeply spiritual and often chanted or drummed in the yard- acts that, he alleges, drew racial abuse from some in the neighborhood. “I had never seen someone be accosted for being Native American,” said Kern de Gonzales. “People would drive by and yell out the window, ‘F***ing Indian. ’”He added that Joss also faced ridicule for his appearance. “Jonathan would be harassed for just being in his yard wearing a dress,” he said. “When people would ask why he wore a dress, he would say, ‘Because I have nice legs.’ And he did. He looked beautiful in a dress. And I think a lot of people were threatened by that, because Jonathan could wear a dress and still be masculine and confident.”","Jonathan Joss, 59, was gunned down Sunday night near his home in San Antonio, Texas.

Harvard Students United To Fight Trump's 'Direct Attacks'





Harvard University has reacted to a fresh executive order issued by US president Donald Trump on Wednesday, which temporarily bans the university from admitting new foreign students. The six-month suspension, according to Harvard officials, is a “retaliatory” act that breaches the university’s constitutional rights.""This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the administration in violation of Harvard's first amendment rights. Harvard will continue to protect its international students,"" a Harvard spokesman said.The executive order cites national security as the reason for the decision. Trump said, “I have determined that the entry of the class of foreign nationals described above is detrimental to the interests of the United States because, in my judgment, Harvard’s conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers,” Trump wrote in the order.The announcement follows months of tension between the Trump administration and Harvard, beginning with the university’s resistance to demands for internal records and governance changes.Homeland security had earlier claimed that Harvard failed to fully cooperate with a request for information on misconduct involving international students. Harvard said it responded, but the administration argued the data was insufficient.Trump’s order affects all foreign students seeking entry to Harvard after the order’s date, though it allows for exceptions if the student’s presence is considered to serve “national interest.” Existing students already in the US may also face visa revocations.The executive order is set to last six months, with a review scheduled within 90 days to assess whether it should be extended.","The executive order cites national security as the reason for the decision.

ANCHORAGE: The crew of a cargo ship carrying 3,000 vehicles to Mexico, including 800 electric vehicles, abandoned ship after they could not control a fire aboard the vessel in waters off Alaska's Aleutian island chain.A large plume of smoke was initially seen at the ship's stern coming from the deck loaded with electric vehicles Tuesday, according to US coast guard photos and a Wednesday statement from the ship's management company, London-based Zodiac Maritime.There were no reported injuries among the 22 crew members of the Morning Midas.Crew members abandoned ship, were evacuated onto a lifeboat and rescued by the crew of a nearby merchant vessel called the Cosco Hellas in the North Pacific, roughly 490 kilometers southwest of Adak Island. Adak is about 1,930 kilometers west of Anchorage, the state's largest city.The crew initiated emergency firefighting procedures with the ship's onboard fire suppression system. But they were unable bring the flames under control.""The relevant authorities have been notified, and we are working closely with emergency responders with a tug being deployed to support salvage and firefighting operations,"" Zodiac Maritime said in a statement.""Our priorities are to ensure the continued safety of the crew and protect the marine environment.""The US coast guard said it sent aircrews to Adak and a ship to the area. The status of the fire onboard the ship was unknown as of Wednesday afternoon, but smoke was still emanating from it, according to the coast guard.Rear Admiral Megan Dean, commander of the coast guard's seventeenth district, said in a statement that as the search and rescue part of the response concluded, the coast guard was working with Zodiac Maritime to determine how to recover the ship and what will be done with it.""We are grateful for the selfless actions of the three nearby vessels who assisted in the response and the crew of motor vessel Cosco Hellas, who helped save 22 lives,"" Dean said.The 183 metre Morning Midas, a car and truck carrier, was built in 2006 and sails under a Liberian flag.The cars left Yantai, China, on May 26, according to the industry site marinetraffic.com. They were being shipped to Lazaro Cardenas, a major Pacific port in Mexico.Earlier this month, a Dutch safety board called for improving emergency response on North Sea shipping routes after a deadly 2023 fire on a freighter that was carrying 3,000 automobiles, including nearly 500 electric vehicles, from Germany to Singapore.That fire killed one person, injured others and burned out of control for a week, and the ship was eventually towed to a port in the northern Netherlands for salvage.The accident increased the focus on safety issues on the open sea and on containers that fall off the massive freighters, which have increased in size dramatically in recent decades. More than 80% of international trade by volume now arrives by sea, and the largest container vessels are longer than three football fields.","The Morning Midas was carrying 3,000 vehicles to Mexico, including 800 electric vehicles.

Outbreaks in affected counties





Immunisation coverage for measles among children has declined, after the Covid pandemic in nearly 80 per cent of over 2,000 US counties analysed in a new study. The drop includes several regions currently experiencing outbreaks.The study, conducted by Johns Hopkins University and recently published in JAMA, was cited by the Associated Press. It highlights increased vulnerability in many areas, in line with state and national data showing declining routine childhood vaccination rates.""When you look at the state level or national level ... you really don't see those drastic drops. Those are there. They're real and they're really problematic,"" said Lauren Gardner, the study's senior author and infectious disease modelling specialist at Johns Hopkins University, who also developed the university’s Covid-19 database.As of Friday, the US has recorded 1,088 measles cases in 2025, the highest year-to-date total in more than three decades. The vast majority of cases have affected unvaccinated individuals and have been traced to both international and domestic travel. Three deaths have occurred during the current outbreaks.Although measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000 due to the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, declining vaccination rates now threaten that status.All 50 states require two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine for public school attendance, yet non-medical exemptions reached record highs in the 2023–2024 school year. Experts emphasise that a 95 per cent vaccination rate is necessary to prevent outbreaks.The Johns Hopkins researchers analysed 2,066 counties in 33 states, comparing average kindergarten vaccination coverage from pre-pandemic years (2017–2020) with post-pandemic rates (2022–2024). When kindergarten-specific data was unavailable, alternative metrics were used to approximate coverage.Since late January, Texas has reported 742 measles cases, most concentrated in West Texas. Gaines County leads with 411 cases, nearly two per cent of its population. Though vaccination coverage rose two percentage points post-pandemic, it remains at just 82.4 per cent, well below herd immunity levels. Terry and Yoakum counties, with 60 and 20 cases respectively, also fall short of the 95 per cent threshold, at 93.7 per cent and 91.8 per cent. Lubbock County, near Gaines, reported 53 cases, with coverage slipping from just under 95 per cent to 91.8 per cent. El Paso County, despite maintaining above-threshold coverage at 96.5 per cent, saw a 2.1-point decline alongside 57 reported cases.Kansas has also seen outbreaks. Gray County reported 25 cases, with vaccination coverage plunging from 94 per cent to 71 per cent. Haskell County saw an 18-point drop to 65 per cent with 11 cases, while Stevens County, with seven cases, dipped to 90.5 per cent.In Colorado, seven cases were traced to a mid-May arrival at Denver International Airport, affecting six residents and one visitor. Arapahoe County logged two cases with coverage at 88.4 per cent. El Paso County reported three cases and a drop to 80 per cent.North Dakota researchers analysed only post-pandemic years due to limited earlier data. Williams County recorded 16 cases with fluctuating coverage: 84.6 per cent in 2022, 87.7 in 2023, then falling to 83.5 per cent in 2024. Cass County, with seven cases, held steady at around 92.7 per cent. Grand Forks County reported 10 cases, with coverage dropping from 95.4 to 93.4 per cent.","US has recorded 1,088 measles cases in 2025, the highest year-to-date total in more than three decades.

A South Florida weather expert told his audience alleging the negative the impact of National Weather Service (NWS) personnel shortages on forecast accuracy.During a broadcast, earlier this week, on NBC affiliate WTVJ, meteorologist John Morales reflected on his 2019 hurricane coverage, stating, ""confidently, I went on TV, and I told you, 'It's going to turn. You don't need to worry; it is going to turn.'""Then he expressed concerns about current capabilities, saying, ""And I am here to tell you, that I am not sure I can do that this year, because of the cuts, the gutting, the sledgehammer attack on science in general.""Morales highlighted specific staffing issues, saying, ""And this is a multi generational impact on science in this country. All right, but specifically, let's talk about the federal government cuts to the National Weather Service and to NOAA. Did you know that Central and South Florida National Weather Service offices are currently basically 20 to 40% understaffed from Tampa to Key west, including the Miami office, 20 to 40% understaffed. Now, this type of staffing shortage is having impacts across the nation because there's been a nearly 20% reduction in weather balloon releases, launches that carry those radiosondes. And what we're starting to see is that the quality of the forecasts is becoming degraded.""Earlier this year, the Department of Government Efficiency, under Elon Musk's leadership (who has now stepped down from the role), implemented severe reductions at NWS and NOAA, organisations responsible for delivering daily weather forecasts, immediate storm alerts, climate surveillance and tracking extreme weather conditions.In February, the agency dismissed hundreds of weather forecasters and placed other federal NOAA staff on probation, followed by additional staff reductions exceeding 1,000 positions. By April, approximately 20 percent of positions remained unfilled across nearly half of the NWS forecast facilities.However, The Hill's Monday report indicated NWS's intention to recruit 126 new staff following substantial workforce reductions. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NWS's parent organisation, had previously reduced staff numbers as part of government downsizing efforts.Florida and other southeastern US states face regular Atlantic hurricane threats, with the season commencing Sunday.NOAA responded on Tuesday via email to The Hill, stating, ""NOAA leadership is taking steps to address those who took a voluntary early retirement option. NWS continues to conduct short-term Temporary Duty assignments (TDYs), and is in the process of conducting a series of Reassignment Opportunity Notices (RONs) to fill roles at NWS field locations with the greatest operational need.""","South Florida meteorologist warns he might not be able to predict hurricanes accurately in future.

Jeffrey Epstein’s hidden wealth revealed: Investment in Peter Thiel’s firm now nets millions for his estate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jeffrey-epsteins-hidden-wealth-revealed-investment-in-peter-thiels-firm-now-nets-millions-for-his-estate/articleshow/121628963.cms,"Jeffrey Epstein (File photo)





Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who died by suicide nearly six years ago, invested $40 million in two funds managed by Valar Ventures, a New York-based firm co-founded by Silicon Valley mogul Peter Thiel, according to a confidential estate financial report obtained by The New York Times. These investments, made during 2015 and 2016, have now grown to an estimated $170 million, making them the largest remaining asset in Epstein’s estate.The financial link between Epstein and Thiel’s firm had remained undisclosed until now. Valar Ventures focuses on tech-based financial services startups, and the firm’s representative described Epstein in 2014 as a “well-known adviser to world leaders, top universities and philanthropic organizations.”The estate, which currently holds over $200 million in assets, has distributed hundreds of millions in settlements to Epstein’s victims and the US Virgin Islands, where Epstein maintained a residence. Yet the substantial returns on the Valar investment are unlikely to benefit the roughly 200 victims who previously accepted monetary settlements, signing releases preventing further claims against the estate or associated individuals.Instead, the funds are expected to go to one of Epstein’s former romantic partners and two longtime advisers who are designated beneficiaries of his estate. A confidential document about the estate’s 1953 Trust, the main vehicle for asset distribution, shows Epstein intended to forgive about $19 million in loans, including some to entities “closely associated” with the estate co-executors and advisers Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn. David Boies , a lawyer for several victims, criticized federal authorities for their lack of pursuit of civil forfeiture actions after Epstein’s death. “While we are grateful for the government’s prosecution of Epstein and Maxwell, the truth is that, both before and afterwards, the government was largely asleep at the switch,” Boies said. Civil forfeiture could have allowed the government to seize remaining estate assets potentially usable for victim compensation. However, a person familiar with the case, quoted by NYT, said federal prosecutors considered this but rejected it to avoid delaying settlement payments.Epstein amassed his wealth by charging high fees for tax and estate services to select billionaires, including retail magnate Leslie Wexner and private equity investor Leon Black. Black reportedly paid Epstein over $158 million in fees, and Epstein’s Manhattan mansion was once owned by Wexner.Aaron Curtis, speaking for Valar, said the firm “hopes that the eventual distribution of these investments can be put to positive use by helping victims move forward with their lives.” However, the Valar investments remain illiquid due to typical venture capital lock-up periods, which means cash disbursements to victims or other parties are delayed.At his death, Epstein’s assets- including investments, properties, artwork, and jewelry- were valued at around $600 million. The estate’s most recent public filing, as of March 31, lists assets exceeding $131 million, including roughly $50 million in cash, though investment values have not been updated since Epstein’s death.Meanwhile, a federal civil lawsuit filed by Boies’ firm seeks to represent unsettled victims in a potential class action against the estate executors. Previous settlements ranged from $500,000 to $2 million per victim. Once this lawsuit is resolved, remaining estate funds will be distributed according to Epstein’s will, which directs assets to the 1953 Trust.","Jeffrey Epstein invested $40 million in two funds managed by Valar Ventures, a New York-based firm co-founded by Silicon Valley mogul Peter Thiel.

‘Russia Will Respond To Ukraine Attack’: Trump Speaks To Putin For 75 Minutes Over Phone





US President Donald Trump revealed that he held a tense phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, discussing the recent Ukrainian strike on Russian airfields and growing concerns over Iran’s nuclear ambitions.In a post on social media platform X, Trump said the call with Putin lasted “approximately one hour and 15 minutes” and was “a good conversation,” though he admitted it would not “lead to immediate Peace.” The two leaders discussed “various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides.”According to Trump, Putin “very strongly” indicated that Russia would respond to Ukraine’s recent airfield attack. The Russian military has accused Kyiv of damaging several docked aircraft in an overnight drone strike on Russian soil, a claim Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied.The call comes just days after Trump gave Putin a blunt two-week deadline to show concrete progress toward ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump warned that unless Russia proves it is serious about peace, “we’ll respond a little bit differently.”Earlier on Monday, Ukrainian and Russian delegations held a second round of peace talks in Istanbul, their second meeting in just over two weeks. However, Russia refused to agree to an unconditional ceasefire.The talks took place shortly after Ukraine carried out a surprise attack on four Russian airbases spread across the country.Discussing Iran’s nuclear weapon issue he told Putin, “I stated to President Putin that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.”He believed that the Russian leader also agreed over this.“President Putin suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion,” he said.He further added that the country had been “slowwalking their decision on this very important matter,” and “we will need a definitive answer in a very short period of time!” he said.Meanwhile, earlier on Wednesday, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that the US proposal for the nuclear agreement was against the country’s national interest.The call came after the US President had earlier issued a stark ultimatum to Putin, giving him a two week deadline to prove his seriousness about ending the war and bringing peace in Ukraine. He also warned that Russia of resorting to a “different” approach had in case Putin had not been genuine about informing the US.","US President Donald Trump held a tense phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"Over 200,000 Afghans forced to leave Pakistan amid intensified deportation drive; Iran ramps up expulsions too",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/over-200000-afghans-forced-to-leave-pakistan-amid-intensified-deportation-drive-iran-ramps-up-expulsions-too/articleshow/121626249.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)





More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since April as Islamabad ramped up its deportation campaign targeting undocumented migrants, with Iran also increasing expulsions, raising concerns over Afghanistan’s capacity to manage the influx.According to Pakistan’s ministry of interior, over 135,000 Afghans left the country in April, followed by 67,000 in May, and more than 3,000 in just the first two days of June. The repatriation drive, which began in November 2023, has now seen over one million Afghans return from Pakistan, reported news agency ANI, citing ARY News.The deportation campaign is aimed at more than 800,000 Afghans whose residency documents have been revoked. Among them are individuals born or raised in Pakistan. Islamabad has accused Afghan nationals of links to terrorism and blamed Kabul for harbouring militants, a charge the Taliban authorities have repeatedly denied.Farmer Mohammad Wali, who crossed into Afghanistan via the southern Spin Boldak border, was quoted by AFP as saying, “We left behind our orchards... but we said to ourselves, ‘If we stay, maybe one day we’ll lose our dignity.’”With Eid al-Adha approaching, the pace of returns has slightly slowed, though crossings continue daily.Iran, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with similar measures. The UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) recorded 15,675 Afghan deportations from Iran in May, more than double the figure in April.The IOM expressed alarm at the increasing number of families, rather than single men, being sent back, calling this “a new and concerning trend.”In late May, Iranian authorities ordered undocumented Afghans to leave by July 6—a move that could impact as many as four million people, according to AFP. Already, more than 450,000 Afghans have returned from Iran since January.Both nations host millions of Afghan refugees who fled decades of conflict.But as economic conditions worsen and political tensions rise, public support for Afghan migrants has diminished. Pakistan, which still hosts around three million Afghans, has also warned it may revoke the UNHCR-issued refugee cards of 1.3 million cardholders by the end of June.The IOM has repeatedly urged countries to “immediately suspend the forced return of Afghans... until safe, voluntary, and dignified return conditions are in place.”The Taliban authorities, who remain internationally unrecognised, have echoed the call, asking for returns to occur in a “dignified” manner.Analysts view the deportation moves, particularly by Pakistan, as politically driven. Islamabad is under pressure to address domestic security threats, especially in border regions plagued by insurgencies.However, rights groups and humanitarian agencies warn that Afghanistan’s already fragile infrastructure is ill-equipped to absorb such a massive and sudden return of people.","More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since April as Islamabad ramped up its deportation campaign targeting undocumented migrants.

Baloch human rights group Paank strongly condemned the killing of two Baloch men whose bodies were found in Kalat, calling it another disturbing sign of growing violence and repression in the region.Samiullah, son of Muhammad Hanif, and Bismillah, son of Ghulam Sarwar, both residents of Padang Abad in Mastung district, were found dead on 3 June in the Ganda Gain neighbourhood of Sheikhri, Kalat. According to Levies officials, both men had been brutally shot, their bodies discarded and later transported to RHC Mangochar for formalities.Paank, in a post on X said, “Forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces on May 29, 2025, their executions are a glaring testament to the ongoing horrors of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings in Balochistan, a despicable violation of humanity that must be stopped.”The rights organisation said 2025 has already seen a surge in such cases. In February alone, Paank documented five extrajudicial executions and 33 enforced disappearances. Among the victims were Bashir Ahmad Marri and Arman Marri, who were reportedly executed in a staged encounter after being abducted in 2023.The group also referred to the tragic case of Rehana, who was shot dead in Awaran while trying to prevent her husband’s kidnapping.In April, Mehrab and Khan Mohammad were tortured to death in Kech after disappearing earlier in the month, while the tortured body of Sher Khan Nazar was discovered in Turbat two days after he went missing.Most recently, Zabid Ali, a resident of Chaghi, was abducted from his home on 11 May.In a separate post on X, Paank demanded the safety and recovery of three members of the family who “were forcibly disappeared in Pidarak area in Kech district.”On June 3, 2025, Pakistani security forces allegedly carried out a series of enforced disappearances in the Pidarak area of Kech district, Balochistan. Among those abducted from their homes were Sinkandar Baloch, son of Muhammad Anwar; Siddique Sabzal, son of Sabzal Baloch; and Ibrahim Yaqoob, son of Yaqoob Baloch. All three men were reportedly detained without any legal process, and their whereabouts remain unknown.Enforced disappearances remain one of Balochistan’s most alarming human rights crises. International watchdogs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have repeatedly urged the Pakistani state to investigate these abuses and take meaningful steps to end the practice, which leaves families traumatised and communities in fear.","Samiullah and Bismillah were found dead on 3 June in the Ganda Gain neighbourhood of Sheikhri, Kalat.

'Vindictive nature': Imran Khan levels fiery charge at Asim Munir; alleges army chief targeted his wife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/vindictive-nature-imran-khan-levels-fiery-charge-at-asim-munir-alleges-army-chief-targeted-his-wife/articleshow/121616395.cms,"Pakistan On Knees, Pleads India To Withdraw This Decision; ‘Reconsider Blocking…’ | Watch





NEW DELHI: Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has accused army chief general Asim Munir of waging a personal vendetta against his wife, Bushra Bibi.In a social media post on Monday, Khan claimed the alleged animosity dates back to his decision to remove Munir from his position as Director General of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) during Khan's tenure.In a social media post on Monday, Khan claimed that following Munir's dismissal, the general attempted to contact Bushra Bibi through intermediaries, but she refused, stating she ""had no involvement with such affairs."" Khan attributed his wife's 14-month imprisonment and alleged mistreatment to ""General Asim Munir's vindictive nature.""Khan further asserted that Bushra Bibi, a private citizen with no political role, has been falsely accused and arrested repeatedly without evidence. “The way my wife has been targeted for personal vengeance is unprecedented. Even during Pakistan’s darkest periods of dictatorship, such a thing never happened,” he said, noting he had not been allowed to meet her in four weeks, despite a scheduled June 1 meeting.Turning his criticism toward the military-backed government and judiciary, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief accused authorities of suppressing democratic dissent and rigging the political system.He blamed the events of May 9, 2023—when military installations were attacked—on a so-called “London Plan” aimed at dismantling PTI. “Our democratic mandate was brazenly stolen, and corrupt individuals — Sharifs and Zardaris — were imposed upon the nation,” he said.Khan alleged that anti-terrorism courts and judges are complicit in the crackdown on his party and deliberately ignoring key evidence. “Despite repeated demands, they refuse to summon or examine the stolen CCTV footage from May 9, 2023… We are innocent. Our people are being sentenced without evidence and without the right to a fair trial.”Calling for a judicial commission, Khan demanded investigations into the deaths of unarmed pro-democracy protesters on May 9 and November 26, 2024. He also lashed out at the judiciary, comparing current Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa to the widely criticised Justice Munir, saying the institution is “driven not by justice but by a desire to protect their own jobs and privileges.”Khan’s remarks come days after a court sentenced 11 PTI supporters, including a lawmaker, for violence and vandalism on May 9 last year—an incident triggered by his arrest.The 72-year-old PTI founder has been in Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi since mid-2023, facing multiple legal cases.","Imran Khan has accused army chief general Asim Munir of waging a personal vendetta against his wife, Bushra Bibi.

A routine safety measure after earthquake tremors turned into a major security breach in Karachi, as over 100 inmates escaped from prison on Tuesday.Officials said the prisoners had been evacuated from their cells as a precaution following a series of mild earthquakes in the area, but chaos erupted when a group of inmates attacked guards, seized their weapons, and managed to flee.According to senior police official Kashif Abbasi, 216 inmates escaped from Malir prison before dawn. He confirmed that 78 of them had already been caught.Police teams were carrying out raids to find the rest. “No one convicted or facing trial as a militant is among those who fled,” Abbasi said.The escape led to a shootout in which one inmate was killed and three security personnel were injured. “The situation has been brought under control,” Abbasi added.Sindh’s home minister, Ziaul Hassan, explained how the jailbreak unfolded. The inmates had been moved out of their cells due to tremors. While they were still outside, some prisoners attacked the guards and fled the premises after opening fire.Prison Superintendent Arshad Shah said the escapees headed towards nearby residential areas. Residents reported that police later used mosque loudspeakers to warn them about the escaped inmates and requested help in identifying and reporting them.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah made a televised appeal, urging the escapees to turn themselves in. “They had only been involved in minor crimes until that point,” he said. “But they could face terror charges if they are arrested by police on the jailbreak charge.”Although prison escapes have happened during court transfers in Pakistan, such mass breakouts from within prison walls remain rare.Karachi has experienced multiple earthquakes in the past 24 hours, with magnitudes ranging from 2.6 to 3.4, according to the National Seismic Monitoring Center.", 216 inmates escaped from Malir prison in Karachi on Tuesday morning.

'Water is Our New Red Line': Pakistan Army Chief Warns India Over Indus Waters Treaty Suspension

NEW DELHI: Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season with a major dip in live storage at its two key dams - Mangla on river Jhelum and Tarbela on Indus - and the ""sudden decrease"" in Chenab river inflows due to regulation of water flow by India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack.The situation may further aggravate this month during early kharif sowing and this is possibly what prompted Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif to raise concerns at a conference on glacier preservation in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, last week to draw global attention to India's decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty Latest estimates by Pakistan's Indus River System Authority (IRSA) show the country is already facing an overall shortage of 21% in water flow and around 50% in live storage of the two key dams which play a crucial role in providing water for irrigation in Punjab and Sindh provinces of Pakistan and generating hydropower.Referring to its latest assessment of availability of water for summer sowing operations during May-Sept, the IRSA in its statement ""noted with concern"" that the ""sudden decrease in river Chenab inflows at Marala due to short supply by India would result in more shortage in early kharif season"".It declared an overall shortage of 21% and advised dam authorities and irrigation supply monitoring agencies to use water from reservoirs judiciously, ""keeping in view the crisis created by Indian short supplies in Chenab river"".Though the situation may improve with monsoon rainfall in the catchment area, possibly by next month, Pakistan's farming operations will depend more on how India regulates the flow through limited infrastructure of its own reservoirs - Baglihar and Salal - on the Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir.India has, so far, only flushed these reservoirs and made additional water storage available by clearing sediments. Besides, it also stopped sharing water flow data with Pakistan after putting the 1960 treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam massacre.Publicly available information on live storage of Pakistan's critical reservoirs shows that Mangla dam is currently left with less than 50% of its fill level (2.7 million acre feet out of the total capacity of 5.9 MAF) whereas Tarbela dam's live storage is slightly over 50% (6 MFA) of its total capacity of 11.6 MFA.Officials here believe that since India is under no obligation to share water flow data with Pakistan after suspending the IWT, it would be difficult for the neighbouring country to even manage floods during the peak flow season once monsoon hits the catchment areas of the Indus river system as a large part of it falls within India.Farming operations in two provinces of Pakistan, Punjab and Sindh, fully depend on irrigation canals linked to the Indus river system, which gets almost its entire waters from the western rivers — Indus, Jhelum and Chenab. Though India has full rights on the waters of eastern rivers (Ravi, Sutlej and Beas) under the IWT, inadequate infrastructure to use the waters by the Indian side benefits Pakistan.India is permitted to construct water storage facilities on western rivers up to 3.6 MAF but has not been able to fully utilise this, making Pakistan a beneficiary by default.","Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season.

""Why shouldn't I fulfill my vow and endure a little pain?""Faqira and two companions, wearing saffron headscarves and carrying a ceremonial flag, joined thousands of others on the gruelling journey to Hinglaj Devi. Along a winding highway and sun-scorched desert paths, groups of resolute pilgrims - mostly men but also women and children - trudged beneath the unforgiving sky, in heat that reached 45Celsius. Some bore idols of the deity, and all chanted ""Jai Mata Di"" .The pilgrimage is an act of spiritual devotion as well as cultural preservation. Pakistan's Hindus number about 4.4 million and make up less than 2% of the country's population, which is more than 96% Muslim.Hindus are often treated as second-class citizens, systemically discriminated against in housing, jobs and access to govt welfare.For many, the pilgrimage to Hinglaj Devi is comparable in significance to the Haj in Islam, a once-in-a-lifetime obligation of faith. The yearning to make the journey is also strong among Hindus in India though it is very difficult for Indians to receive visas to travel to Pakistan. States bordering Pakistan have deep spiritual links to Hinglaj Devi that are rooted in traditions predating the Partition.For much of the 20th century, the Hinglaj Devi temple remained inaccessible. The pilgrimage gained momentum only in the 1990s. A transformative shift came in the early 2000s with the construction of the Makran Coastal Highway, which links the rest of Pakistan to the Chinese-operated Gwadar deep-sea port.The highway brought unprecedented access to the temple -- it became possible to make the bulk of the journey by vehicle, taking some of the sweat out of the endeavour. Still, thousands continue to make the journey by foot. They are considered the more spiritually devoted. ""The real pilgrimage is in the pain, the feeling,"" said Faqira on the fourth day of his trek.One of his two companions collapsed from heat exhaustion after walking nearly 70 miles and had to return home by bus. Faqira carried on, his feet blistered and bandaged. Each pilgrim walks with a personal vow.Minakshi, part of a group of women dressed in yellow and red, undertook the journey to ask the goddess for a son. Nearby, 60-year-old Raj Kumari was making her seventh pilgrimage, praying for her grandson's well-being. Also on the trek was a childless couple, married since 2018.Hinglaj Devi temple is one of the sites where the remains of Sati, goddess of marital devotion and longevity, fell to Earth after her self-immolation. For many of the faithful, the pilgrimage begins with a symbolic trek to a sacred mud volcano rising from the barren landscape near the Makran Coastal Highway. At the summit, devotees toss coconuts and rose petals into the bubbling crater to seek divine permission to proceed. Many also smear volcanic clay on their faces and bodies. The next stage takes pilgrims to the Hingol River for a ritual bath. From there, they continue 28 miles to the Hinglaj Devi temple, set within a natural cave.The complex houses four shrines, the most revered being the Nani Mandir. After reaching the shrines, devotees complete the pilgrimage with an arduous, hourslong trek across seven mountains, before returning to the temple to pray.","Hinglaj Devi temple is a site sacred to the Hindu minority in Pakistan. Pakistan's Hindus number about 4.4 million and make up less than 2% of the country's population. For many, the pilgrimage is comparable in significance to the Haj in Islam, a once-in-a-lifetime obligation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121544231,imgsize-1405202,width-400,resizemode-4/121544231.jpg"

Sharif's remarks came after India, soon after the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, announced abeyance of the IWT among other punitive measures.

DHAKA: Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain Tuesday accused India of declaring ""people"" foreigners and ""pushing"" them into his country without following the process of deportation. Dhaka will send a diplomatic note to New Delhi on the issue, he said.The deportation of illegal Bangladeshis by India started following a nationwide verification drive after the April 22 Pahalgam attack and picked up pace since Operation Sindoor was launched on May 7.Under the deportation process, each case is being reviewed individually and only verified citizens will be repatriated, but ""India is resorting to cross-border push ins"", Hossain said. ""We will send a new, substantive letter,"" he stated, adding. ""We see that push-ins are still happening. But it is not something we can physically stop.""India has provided Bangladesh with a list of individuals it claims are Bangladeshi nationals. Dhaka has accepted some of them following verification, Hossain said. He stressed that there is a formal mechanism in place for addressing consular issues and that Bangladesh is working to ensure all actions adhere to procedures. Bangladesh remains in regular communication with India, he said.About deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's pending extradition, Hossain said that there has been no new response from parties concerned.

Here's how the escape took place:





In a meticulously orchestrated operation, former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina departed Dhaka on August 5, 2024, under a veil of secrecy, amid escalating political unrest. She landed at Hindon Airport in India.Hasina's aircraft remained the most tracked plane that day. As per real-time data from the flightradar24 website, Bangladesh Air Force aircraft AJAX1431 become the most tracked plane globally, with over 29,000 people following its route at one point of time.The Bangladesh Air Force's Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft, designated AJAX1431, took off from Bangabandhu Airbase at 3.09pm, officially listed as a training flight. To obscure its trajectory, the aircraft's transponders and automatic geolocator systems were deactivated until it neared Indian airspace over West Bengal, The Daily Star reported citing sources.Upon approaching Indian airspace, AJAX1431 reactivated its transponders at waypoint ""BEMAK"" and altered its course from Kolkata to Hindon Air Force Base in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh.This clandestine departure occurred just 30 minutes before protesters seized the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's official residence.Army Chief General Waker-uz-Zaman, unaware of Hasina's departure, was preparing to announce her resignation. In a later interview, he acknowledged the volatile situation and the potential risks to Hasina's life had she remained in the country.""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said.","Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, 2024, amid escalating political unrest. She landed at Hindon Airport in India.

Bangladesh's Supreme Court on Sunday ordered the Election Commission to restore the right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami's party registration, nearly eight months after the interim govt lifted a ban on it, clearing the way for its participation in future elections.Court officials said the SC's appellate division, led by chief justice Syed Refaat Ahmed, directed the commission to restore the party's registration.The apex court said it was up to EC to decide if Jamaat could contest polls using its traditional ""scale"" symbol.EC scrapped the registration of Jamaat, which was opposed to Bangladesh's 1971 independence from Pakistan, in Dec 2018 in line with a HC ruling. In 2013, SC cancelled the registration of the Jamaat-e-Islami, saying the party is unfit to contest national elections.Former PM Sheikh Hasina's govt slapped a total ban on the party days ahead of her ouster on Aug 5, 2024 in a violent mass movement led by a platform called Students against Discrimination (SAD).Jamaat and several other parties had backed SAD.After Hasina's ouster, the party appealed for a review of the 2013 court order banning it.""Today concludes the decade-long legal battle.

India's First Reaction After Bangladesh Bans Sheikh Hasina's Awami League Party

Proceedings aired live, a first for Bangladesh





DHAKA: Prosecutors at Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) on Sunday formally charged former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and two others with crimes against humanity and other charges, including mass murder, for their alleged role in a violent crackdown last year in which hundreds of people were killed.The other two charged for the crimes with Hasina are former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and former inspector general of police (IGP) Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun.""We do hereby take into cognisance the charges,"" the three-judge ICT bench led by Justice Golam Mortuza Majumdar said after a prosecution team accused them of attempting to tame the student-led protests using brutal force. The tribunal ordered investigators to present all three accused before the court on June 16. Mamun is in police custody. Hasina and Kamal are residing abroad.Sunday's proceedings marked the start of Hasina's trial in absentia nearly 10 months after the ouster of her government following protests. Under ICT law, if convicted, Hasina and the co-accused could face the death penalty.The proceedings were broadcast live on television for the first time in Bangladesh’s history.The complaint, submitted by chief prosecutor Tajul Islam, outlined five counts of alleged crimes, including murder, attempted murder, torture and other inhumane acts.The accused are also charged with abetting, inciting, facilitating and being complicit in, as well as failing to prevent, a series of crimes reportedly committed against civilians by law enforcement agencies and armed affiliates of the Awami League. One count specifically refers to a violent crackdown on unarmed student demonstrators, which allegedly followed a press briefing by Hasina on July 14. Prosecutors claim that in the aftermath, Kamal, IGP Mamun and other senior government officials were directly involved in enabling and overseeing the assault.“Upon reviewing the evidence, we concluded that it was a coordinated, widespread and systematic attack,” Islam told the court. “The accused unleashed all law enforcement agencies and her (Hasina’s) armed party members to crush the uprising.”The ICT was set up by Hasina in 2009 to investigate crimes committed by the Pakistani army during Bangladesh’s war for independence in 1971. Six top leaders of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and one leader of former PM Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party were hanged to death after being convicted by the court. According to a UN rights office report, some 1,400 people were killed between July 15 and Aug 15 last year as violence continued even after the fall of Hasina’s Awami League regime.","Proceedings aired live, a first for Bangladesh.

Bangladesh unveiled new currency designs, marking a significant change on Sunday.The notes no longer feature the image of its first president, who was also the father of exiled former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, ousted from power last year.The nation is home to around 170 million people and is presently under caretaker administration following Hasina's departure, coinciding with the commencement of her trial on Sunday for allegedly suppressing the August 2024 uprising against her leadership.Previously, all currency notes displayed the image of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who governed Bangladesh from its independence from Pakistan in 1971 until his assassination, along with most family members, during a military takeover in 1975.""Under the new series and design, the notes will not feature any human portraits, but will instead showcase natural landscapes and traditional landmarks,"" Bangladesh Bank spokesman Arif Hossain Khan told AFP.The revised designs in this predominantly Muslim country incorporate imagery of Hindu and Buddhist religious structures, alongside historical buildings.The artwork includes pieces by the renowned artist Zainul Abedin, illustrating the Bengal famine during British rule.One design features the national memorial honouring those who sacrificed their lives in the independence conflict with Pakistan.The central bank released three of nine denominations on Sunday.""The new notes will be issued from the central bank's headquarters, and later from its other offices across the country,"" he added.""The other denominations of the notes with new designs will be released in phases"".The current notes and coins will continue to be valid alongside the new currency. This alteration reflects previous changes influenced by political shifts.The initial currency from 1972, after the country's renaming from East Pakistan, featured a geographical representation.Subsequent notes displayed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, leader of the Awami League, which Hasina later headed during her 15-year administration. During periods of alternative leadership, particularly under the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the notes featured cultural and archaeological sites.The Awami League received a ban last month pending legal proceedings against Hasina and other party officials. Hasina, aged 77, currently resides in India by choice, refusing to comply with an extradition request for her trial attendance.","Bangladesh unveils new currency designs, marking a significant change.

TOI correspondent from London: Indigenous communities across India are being pushed out of their ancestral lands in the name of tourism and expansion of tiger projects whilst the laws to protect them are being diluted and not implemented properly, Adivasis told a global press briefing on Monday.“They say India has got freedom. But I think Adivasi people have not yet got freedom,” J C Shivamma, from the Jenu Kuruba tribe, said at the online event organised by Community Network Against Protected Areas.She is among the 52 households who reoccupied their ancestral land within Nagarhole tiger reserve on May 5, 35 years after their families were forcibly evicted.“Some of our family members died when in the plantations, but our sacred deities, our graveyard, everything that concerns us, is still in the village, so we used to go back to bury our people in our ancestral land, but it was always a fight with the forest department toconduct rituals. We consider our ancestors to be on the lands, they become deities and this way we were tortured. If we have to die, we will die on our ancestral land,” she said.Shivu JA recalled how their houses were burnt and elephants brought to destroy their fields when they were evicted from Karadikallu. “This land is ours. It's not any tiger project or scheme of the govt for tiger conservation,” he said.“Our elders are very happy now.We are having our food, we are going for honey collection. We have our own water resource. We sit together in the evening, and they are teaching us songs. All these songs and lessons were silenced for 40 years.""“The forest department keeps saying that only after your rights are recognised, you can live on this land. We already have these rights,” he said.The Jenu Kurubas are filing a case against the Forest Department under the SC/ST Atrocities Act for withholding their rights and filing an appeal against 39 rejected forest rights claims.“Why are their rights not being recognised despite the notification of central legislation such as the Forest Rights Act 2006,” asked scholar Nitin Rai.“People across the country in different states are fighting the same battles. It is important to find a way to raise a collective voice for what is happening all over,” said lawyer Lara Jesani.","Indigenous communities across India are being pushed out of their ancestral lands in the name of tourism and expansion of tiger projects. 52 households reoccupied their ancestral land within Nagarhole tiger reserve on May 5, 35 years after their families were forcibly evicted.

Summer drought risk







LONDON: The UK experienced its warmest spring on record, and its driest in more than 50 years, the country's official weather service said on Monday.Temperatures for the season have been frequently elevated this century, according to the data from the Met Office, which said: ""Eight of the 10 warmest UK springs have occurred since the year 2000. ""The data ""clearly shows that recent decades have been warmer, sunnier, and often drier than the 20th century average,"" said Met Office scientist Emily Carlisle.The Met Office said provisional temperatures registered between March and May this year averaged 9.51 degrees Celsius (49.1 degrees Fahrenheit).That beat the last record, set in last year's spring, when the average was 9.37 degrees.The next warmest springs were in 2011, 2014 and 2007, according to the Met Office which has been recording temperature data since 1884.This year, the 128.2 millimetres (five inches) of rainfall recorded across the UK during the season was ""approximately 40 percent below the long-term average and still the driest spring in more than 50 years"", it said.""England was particularly dry, experiencing its driest spring in more than 100 years, beaten only by 1893,"" it added.The Met Office's Carlisle said: ""The UK's climate continues to change. What's particularly notable about spring 2025 is the combination of record warmth and sunshine, alongside very low rainfall.""""This spring shows some of the changes we're seeing in our weather patterns, with more extreme conditions, including prolonged dry, sunny weather, becoming more frequent,"" she said.The recent weather's dominant feature had been the persistent high-pressure systems, often coming from the Azores or mainland Europe.These had lingered over the UK since late February and blocked the usual flow of Atlantic weather fronts, allowing high pressure to dominate, the Met Office said.Last month, the Environment Agency (EA) called a meeting of its national drought group after it said levels in reservoirs were ""exceptionally low"".In the meeting, the EA's deputy water director, Richard Thompson warned that ""changing climate means we will see more summer droughts in the coming decades"".The agency added that, while there was no official drought yet, there was a ""medium risk"" of a summer drought without sustained rainfall.The UK government has said it would step in to fast-track the building of two new reservoirs.According to the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, no new water reservoirs have been built since 1992.Scientists warn that extreme and fluctuating weather events are becoming increasingly common as planet-heating fossil fuel emissions keep rising.","The UK experienced its warmest spring on record, and its driest in more than 50 years.

L ONDON: A Turkish-born man who burned a Quran in London was on Monday found guilty of a religiously aggravated public order offence, in a case taken up by free-speech campaigners.Hamit Coskun, 50, shouted ""Islam is religion of terrorism"" and ""Quran is burning"" as he set the book alight outside the Turkish consulate in London last February 13.District Judge John McGarva at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court found Coskun guilty of using disorderly behaviour ""within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress"".He was motivated by ""hostility towards members of a religious group, namely followers of Islam"", said McGarva, who issued Coskun a £240 ($325) fine, with a statutory surcharge of £96.""Your actions in burning the Quran where you did were highly provocative, and your actions were accompanied by bad language in some cases directed toward the religion and were motivated at least in part by hatred of followers of the religion,"" said the judge.State prosecutors insisted Coskun was not being prosecuted for burning the book.""He is being prosecuted for his disorderly behaviour in public,"" said Philip McGhee, for the Crown Prosecution Service.A passerby filmed the incident, which also showed a man, allegedly holding a knife or bladed item, approaching Coskun and appearing to slash out at him, the court heard.Coskun, an atheist who is currently claiming asylum in the UK, posted on social media that he was protesting against the ""Islamist government"" of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.His legal fees are being paid by the Free Speech Union (FSU) and the National Secular Society, which argued he was essentially being prosecuted for blasphemy, despite Britain's free-speech guarantees.The FSU called the verdict ""deeply disappointing"" on its X account.""Everyone should be able to exercise their rights to protest peacefully and to freedom of expression, regardless of how offensive or upsetting it may be to some people,"" it said.","Hamit Coskun, 50, shouted ""Islam is religion of terrorism"" and ""Quran is burning"" as he set the book alight outside the Turkish consulate in London last February 13.

Starmer Slams Badenoch For 'Echoing Kremlin Talk' In Heated UK Parliament Clash

LONDON: Britain announced it will build 12 new attack submarines as it was set to unveil Monday a major defence review to deal with ""growing"" Russian aggression and the changing nature of warfare.Prime Minister Keir Starmer told BBC radio that ""there is greater instability on defence and security than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.""His Labour government will later publish its Strategic Defence Review, a document that will assess threats facing the UK and make recommendations.The review warns that Britain is entering ""a new era of threat"" as drones and artificial intelligence transform modern warfare, The Guardian newspaper reported over the weekend.""I wanted a review that told me the challenges we're actually facing and likely to face for the foreseeable future,"" Starmer told the BBC Monday.""And the principles are clear: war-fighting readiness, integrating our forces... and a Nato first approach,"" he added.The UK has been racing to rearm in the face of the threat from Russia and fears that US President Donald Trump will no longer help protect Europe.Starmer said it would serve as ""a blueprint for strength and security for decades to come"".His government pledged in February to lift defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2027 in the ""largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War"".And despite budget constraints, it aims for spending to rise to three per cent in the next parliamentary term, due in 2029.The Labour government has said it will cut UK overseas aid to help fund the spending.Based on the recommendations of the review, which is led by former Nato secretary general George Robertson, the government said Sunday that it would boost stockpiles and weapons production capacity, which could be scaled up if needed.This includes £1.5 billion ($2 billion) for building ""at least six munitions and energetics factories"", procuring 7,000 domestically built long-range weapons, and spending £6 billion on munitions over the current parliamentary term.The government also said late Sunday that it would build up to 12 new attack submarines as part of its Aukus military alliance with Australia and the United States, and invest £15 billion in its nuclear warhead programme.The defence ministry last week pledged £1 billion for the creation of a ""cyber command"" to help on the battlefield.""We're in a world that is changing now... and it is a world of growing threats,"" defence secretary John Healey told the BBC in an interview Sunday.""It's growing Russian aggression. It's those daily cyberattacks, it's new nuclear risks, and it's increasing tension in other parts of the world as well,"" he said.The last such defence review was commissioned in 2021 by the previous Conservative government, and was revised in 2023 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.While launching the new review, Robertson said it would tackle threats from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, calling them a ""deadly quartet"".But in an op-ed in The Sun newspaper, Starmer did not mention China, while warning that ""The Kremlin is working hand in hand with its cronies in Iran and North Korea.""The softer rhetoric on China is in line with the Labour government's efforts to thaw relations with Beijing, which reached new lows under former prime minister Rishi Sunak 's Conservative government.The review describes Russia as an ""immediate and pressing"" threat, but calls China a ""sophisticated and persistent challenge"", according to The Guardian.At a time when Washington is demanding that its Nato allies bolster their own defences, Britain is considering strengthening its deterrent by buying nuclear-missile capable aircrafts from the United States, The Sunday Times reported.Without confirming or denying, Healey said Sunday that ""strong deterrence is absolutely essential in order to keep Britain and the British people safe"".","UK to unveil major defence review to deal with ""growing"" Russian aggression.

UK Threatens To Sue Abramovich Over £2.5 BN Chelsea Sale As Russia-UK Tensions Escalate





LONDON: Sikh Federation UK has warned PM Keir Starmer it will campaign to no-platform Labour MPs from Aug 1 unless a judge-led public inquiry into Britain’s role in 1984’s Operation Blue Star is announced in Parliament by the end of July.No-platforming is a political strategy where people actively work to prevent certain politicians or public figures from speaking publicly, often due to disagreements with their views.The warning, delivered in a letter signed by 455 gurdwaras and Sikh organisations, follows a rally of more than 10,000 Sikhs at Trafalgar Square Sunday marking the 41st anniversary of the military operation at Amritsar’s Golden Temple against Sikh militants hiding there.Deputy PM Angela Rayner had publicly committed to the inquiry just before the 2024 general elections. Labour also promised it in two consecutive manifestos.The federation insists the inquiry must investigate both UK involvement in the Indian military operation and anti-Sikh actions in Britain during Margaret Thatcher’s tenure. It plans to contact every MP individually, asking them to confirm written support for a judge-led inquiry by July-end.The letter warns Starmer that failing to act “could have massive consequences for the re-election of many Labour MPs”, citing rising support for Reform UK and independent candidates. Sikh Federation UK also said it is in talks with Reform UK, Liberal Democrats, and SNP to secure broader political backing.Documents declassified in Jan 2014 showed Thatcher’s government sent an SAS officer to India in Feb 1984 after Indian officials requested help planning an operation to remove Sikh militants from the Golden Temple.In Feb 2014, then-cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood concluded there was “no record of any assistance to the June 1984 operation other than the limited military advice provided in mid-February,” describing it as a “one-off”.Sikh Federation disputes this, citing its 2017 Sacrificing Sikhs report. “The papers released prove training and equipment was secretly provided by Britain before the Indian army assault in June 1984,” the letter says. “In addition, counter-insurgency training and equipment were provided to Indian army and police to deal with the Sikh uprising that followed the massacre. We are confident a judge-led public inquiry will prove the UK involvement had a massive rather than limited impact. ”",Sikh Federation UK has warned PM Keir Starmer it will campaign to no-platform Labour MPs from Aug 1 unless a judge-led public inquiry is announced in Parliament.

The number of migrants reaching the UK in small boats in a single day hits a 2025 high,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/the-number-of-migrants-reaching-the-uk-in-small-boats-in-a-single-day-hits-a-2025-high/articleshow/121549944.cms,"Representative image (AI)





LONDON: UK government figures Sunday showed that more than 1,100 migrants arrived in the country on Saturday in small boats from France across the English Channel, the highest number recorded on a single day so far this year.The latest Home Office figures show that 1,194 migrants arrived in 18 boats on Saturday in what were settled weather conditions, bringing the provisional annual total so far to 14,811.That's 42% higher than the same point last year, an increase that has piled pressure on the Labour government, which returned to power nearly a year ago, partly on disillusionment with the previous conservative administration's efforts to get a grip on the numbers making the crossing.Having ditched the Conservative government's plan to send migrants who arrived in the UK by unauthorized means to Rwanda, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government would get control by smashing the gangs and the business models that sustain their smuggling operations.Since gaining power, Starmer's government has sought better intelligence-sharing internationally, enhanced enforcement operations in northern France, and has adopted tougher rules in its immigration legislation.French police officers were seen watching Saturday as migrants boarded at a beach in Gravelines, between Calais and Dunkirk, and authorities were then pictured escorting the boats. French authorities said they rescued 184 people.""Pretty shocking, those scenes yesterday,"" defense secretary John Healey told Sky News.He added that it is a ""huge problem"" that French police are unable to intervene to intercept boats in shallow waters, adding that the UK is pressing for the French to put new rules into operation so they can intervene.""They're not doing it, but, but for the first time for years ... we've got the level of cooperation needed,"" he told Sky News. ""We've got the agreement that they will change the way they work, and our concentration now is to push them to get that into operation so they can intercept these smugglers and stop these people in the boats, not just on the shore.""Despite French and UK efforts, the cross-Channel route, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Many migrants favor the UK for reasons of language, family ties or perceived easier access to asylum and work.The home office says 36,816 people arrived in the UK on small boats in 2024, 25% more than in 2023 (29,437). The highest number of arrivals was in 2022, with 45,774.","1,194 migrants arrived in 18 boats on Saturday in what were settled weather conditions.

The United Kingdom's defence review has warned against “immediate and pressing” threat from Russia, meanwhile, China poses a “sophisticated and persistent challenge”. The government's strategic review is set to be concluded on Monday, the Guardian reported.A 130-page document authored by three advisers to UK PM Keir Starmer also suggested on drawing extensively on lessons from the war in Ukraine. While Russia was the central concern, the document also highlighted China, that has at times cooperated with Moscow. It further identified Iran and North Korea as smaller but significant “regional disruptors.”According to the report, Britain was entering “a new era of threat,” as drones, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies were transforming the nature of warfare more profoundly than ever before.The analysis is not expected to announce new defence spending commitments but will reaffirm Starmer’s February pledge to raise the defence budget to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, and to 3% in the following parliament. However, the document is likely to support a major medium-term spending increase—potentially exceeding £50 billion in real terms—that may be agreed at the upcoming Nato summit in June.There, Western allies are considering a proposal to raise core defence spending to 3.5% of GDP by 2032, with an additional 1.5% dedicated to cyber and infrastructure efforts, partly in response to mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump.It is also expected to address the issue of British army size, as tensions continue between the ministry of defence and the treasury over whether to commit to increasing troop numbers beyond the current target of 73,000. This comes amid fresh figures revealing that the army's strength has fallen to 70,860 full-time trained soldiers as of 1 April—its lowest level since the Napoleonic era—marking a 2.3% decline over the past year.Meanwhile, US defense secretary Pete Hegseth has also warned Indo-Pacific allies of an ""imminent threat"" from China, reassuring them that they would not face growing military and economic pressure from the country alone.","Britain's defence review has warned against “immediate and pressing” threat from Russia.

Prince William may be on holiday with Kate Middleton and their three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, but his work as the Duke of Cornwall never truly takes a back seat.During a recent visit to the Duchy of Cornwall estate, The Telegraph witnessed how William remains focused on improving life for its residentseven while away with his family.One of the family’s favourite spots is Tresco, an island in the Isles of Scilly, part of the duchy. Here, the prince is well known for chatting with locals about community needs and development. His efforts have led to tangible improvements, including a new healthcare centre with a maternity suite, housing plans for essential workers like teachers and doctors, and initiatives promoting sustainable tourism.The Isles of Scilly hold a special place for William, as family holidays there echo his own childhood trips with Princess Diana and the future King Charles, People reported.A holidaymaker who spotted the couple in 2020 told the Daily Mirror, “William and Kate were riding their bicycles, having a laugh. They looked so happy enjoying the weather. I did do a double-take. They were really friendly and said hello.”In May this year, Prince William returned to the Isles of Scilly on official duty — much to the chagrin of his family.“My family are very upset I’m here without them,” he told the Daily Mail. “The children will kill me if I don’t go home later.” He was spotted buying pastries at a local cafe, likely to bring back for them.The Duchy of Cornwall, established by King Edward III in 1337, covers around 130,000 acres of land and assets, supporting the heir to the throne and his family financially. But William’s focus goes beyond finance, he is committed to bettering the lives of those living on duchy land, prioritising sustainability, mental health, and charitable partnerships.“II’m trying to make sure I’m prioritizing stuff that’s going to make people’s lives, living in those areas, better. This is what we’re going to do to make people’s lives in Cornwall better,” William said.","Prince William is on holiday with his family in the Isles of Scilly, part of the Duchy of Cornwall.

Prince William is quietly changing what it means to be heir to the throne and those who work with him say he’s not afraid to do things differently.Following King Charles’ accession in 2022, the Prince of Wales inherited the Duchy of Cornwall, a vast estate spanning over 130,000 acres across more than 20 counties in England and Wales. Now worth more than £800 million, the duchy provides income for the heir to the throne but under Prince William’s leadership, it is becoming far more than just a source of funds.The 42-year-old royal is reportedly a demanding leader who visits parts of the duchy every four to six weeks.Will Bax, the duchy’s secretary, called William ""pretty demanding,"" but in a good way.Speaking to The Telegraph, he said that the Prince is ""a man on a mission.""“He’s easy to follow because he’s got great conviction and personality, and he really wears his heart on his sleeve in terms of social interest and his desire to have a positive impact in the world.”Estate director Ben Murphy also called William’s leadership “energising”, and compared it to his father’s, ""healthy impatience, as his father did,"" which ""puts the wind in our sails,"" PeoplePrince William sees the Duchy as more than just a royal portfolio.“I see the Duchy as an extension of the work we do with the Royal Foundation,” he told the newspaper. “I see it as a branch of my philanthropy.""He further added that there’s so much good that can be done in the rural world, ""I see it as another arm to the work that I want to do, which is being a positive force for good.”Key priorities under his stewardship included tackling homelessness, supporting mental health among farmers, and boosting sustainability across rural communities. The duchy has partnered with local groups on housing initiatives and mental health outreach, particularly for those working in agriculture who often face isolation.“I’m trying to make sure I’m prioritizing stuff that’s going to make people’s lives, living in those areas, better. This is what we’re going to do to make people’s lives in Cornwall better,” William said.“That, I feel as Duke of Cornwall, is something I should be doing. It’s about responsibility, it’s about leadership and doing what’s right on the social issues of our time.”Even family getaways are laced with purpose. During visits to the Isles of Scilly with Kate and their children — Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis — the Prince often chats with locals about their needs. These conversations have already led to drastic results, including improved healthcare facilities, new housing for key workers, and steps towards more sustainable tourism.Bax said, “He’s asking us to change and evolve in a way to deliver positive impact at scale and at pace.”The duchy’s most recent Integrated Annual Report, released in July, reported a surplus of £23.9 million for the 2023–24 financial year, Prince William’s first full year as Duke of Cornwall.","Duchy of Cornwall is a vast estate spanning over 130,000 acres across more than 20 counties in England and Wales.

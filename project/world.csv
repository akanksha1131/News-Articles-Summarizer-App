'Pandemic-era freeze revoked': Why will millions in US face wage garnishment after May 5?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pandemic-era-freeze-revoked-why-will-millions-in-us-face-wage-garnishment-after-may-5/articleshow/120503057.cms,"Starting May 5, the US Education Department will resume collections on defaulted federal student loans , ending a pandemic-era freeze and putting millions of borrowers at risk of wage garnishment and seized tax refunds.“American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,” said Education Secretary Linda McMahon, announcing that the department will begin referring overdue debts to the Treasury Department’s offset program. Borrowers in default will face withheld federal payments and garnished wages after a 30-day notice.Currently, around 5.3 million borrowers are in default, and another 4 million are nearing that threshold. Borrowers are considered in default after missing payments for nine months, a status that damages credit and opens the door to collections.The move, a shift under the Trump administration, follows years of leniency during and after the Covid-19 pandemic. Federal student loan collections were paused in March 2020 and remained so through the Biden administration’s multiple — and mostly blocked — efforts at sweeping loan forgiveness.Critics say the restart will hurt working families still struggling with inconsistent policy changes. “This is cruel, unnecessary and will further fan the flames of economic chaos,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center.Confusion has mounted amid layoffs at the Federal Student Aid office, paused repayment applications, and legal uncertainty over income-driven plans like the Biden-era SAVE Plan. “Things are really difficult to understand right now,” said Kristin McGuire of Young Invincibles. “People are in default because they can’t pay their loans and because they don’t know how to pay their loans.”Borrowers still have an option to avoid garnishment through loan rehabilitation, which involves nine on-time payments and is available only once, said Betsy Mayotte of The Institute for Student Loan Advisors.While President Biden has approved over $183 billion in targeted relief for more than 5 million borrowers, McMahon said the administration went too far. “Going forward… we will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law,” she said.","Starting May 5, the US Education Department will resume collections on defaulted federal student loans.

"Pope Francis Tomb: ‘With lively hope in eternal life’: Pope Francis wanted a humble tomb at Rome’s St Mary Major Basilica, reveals his will",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/with-lively-hope-in-eternal-life-pope-francis-wanted-a-humble-tomb-at-romes-st-mary-major-basilica-reveals-his-will/articleshow/120502954.cms,"Pope Francis wanted a humble tomb at Rome’s St Mary Major Basilica, reveals his will (Picture credit: AP)

Pope Francis, who passed away on Monday at the age of 88, had long expressed his desire to be buried in the Papal Basilica of St Mary Major in Rome, instead of the traditional burial site for popes , St Peter’s Basilica.According to The New York Times, the Vatican released his last will and testament on the same day, revealing that he wished to be laid to rest in a simple, undecorated tomb bearing only the inscription “Franciscus.”In his will, dated June 29, 2022, the feast of Saints Peter and Paul, Francis wrote, “I wish my last earthly journey to end at this very ancient Marian shrine,” referring to St Mary Major. He said that he had visited the basilica at the beginning and end of every apostolic journey, and after each hospitalisation, including his final discharge on March 23 from a 38-day stay at Gemelli Hospital.Though unable to get out of the car, he stopped in front of the basilica to pray.“I have always entrusted my life and my priestly and episcopal ministry to the Mother of Our Lord, Mary Most Holy,” Francis stated, explaining his devotion to the Salus Populi Romani icon located in the Pauline Chapel, where he requested his tomb be placed nearby.His will also reflected the humility that marked his life. Francis asked that “the tomb must be in the earth; simple, without particular decoration,” with no mention of his papacy on the tombstone. “With lively hope in eternal life,” he wrote, “I offer the suffering of the last part of my life for peace in the world and brotherhood among peoples.”According to the Vatican’s death certificate, Francis died at 7:35 am (local time) from a cerebral stroke that led to a coma and irreversible cardiac arrest.Prof Andrea Arcangeli, head of the Vatican’s health offices, noted the pope had long suffered from hypertension, Type II diabetes, bronchiectasis and had previously endured respiratory failure and pneumonia.In his autobiography Hope, Francis said he did not wish to be buried in St Peter’s, explaining, “The Vatican is the home of my final service, not my eternity.” He also dismissed traditional funeral pomp, requesting “no catafalque, no triple coffin,” and asked instead for burial “with dignity, but like any other Christian.”As per DW, this makes Francis the first pope in nearly 150 years not to be buried at St Peter’s Basilica.The last was Pope Pius IX, whose remains were moved three years after burial. Francis’ final resting place will be near the Queen of Peace statue, fulfilling what he called a lifelong devotion to Mary , “whose embrace I have sought more than a hundred times during my pontificate.”","Pope Francis, who passed away on Monday at the age of 88, had long expressed his desire to be buried in the Papal Basilica of St Mary Major in Rome.

"Signalgate 2.0: After Hegseth’s leaked Signal chat, watchdog files suit to preserve Trump officials’ messages",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/signalgate-2-0-after-hegseths-leaked-signal-chat-watchdog-files-suit-to-preserve-trump-officials-messages/articleshow/120501809.cms,"A nonprofit watchdog group, American Oversight, expanded a lawsuit on Monday aimed at several senior national security officials in the Trump administration, requesting a federal judge to mandate the preservation of all messages sent via the encrypted communications app Signal.The lawsuit was filed in US District Court in Washington, DC, and focuses on messages related to official business that have been sent using Signal, an app with an auto-delete feature and no apparent record-keeping system for federal records.The amended lawsuit follows a New York Times report revealing that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared details about military strikes in Yemen on March 15 in a private Signal group chat. The chat, which also included Hegseth’s wife, brother, and personal lawyer, was part of a broader issue of government officials using Signal for official communications.The suit expands on an earlier version filed by American Oversight in response to the revelation that Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Vice President JD Vance were part of a separate Signal chat where they discussed sensitive matters about military strikes in Yemen against Houthi rebels. The lawsuit contends that the use of Signal by top officials for official government business is widespread and may violate federal records retention requirements.American Oversight’s new request asks Judge James Boasberg, who is overseeing the case, to preserve messages sent by or received from Hegseth, Ratcliffe, and other officials, including National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Late last month, Boasberg had already ordered the preservation of messages from the ""Houthi PC Small Group Chat,"" where officials discussed the Yemen strikes.Hegseth's use of Signal for these communications raised further concern when it was revealed that a second chat—dubbed “Defense 'Team Huddle'”—included details of the same Yemen strikes and involved 13 individuals, including Hegseth's family members and other personal associates. The group was not authorized to use Signal for sensitive or classified information, raising questions about the handling of government communication.In response, the White House and Pentagon dismissed concerns, accusing former employees of spreading false information. White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly argued that ""no classified information was shared"" in the chats and claimed that disgruntled ex-employees were attempting to undermine the administration.President Donald Trump publicly defended Hegseth, calling any concerns over his actions a ""waste of time."" Speaking on the South Lawn after the Easter Egg Roll, Trump expressed confidence in Hegseth's handling of military operations. ""He's doing a great job – ask the Houthis how he's doing,"" Trump remarked, referring to the Yemen rebel group targeted in the strikes.Trump’s backing of Hegseth is part of a broader pattern of standing by his top officials, despite controversies. Sources close to the president have stated that Trump is determined to resist any pressure to dismiss Hegseth, emphasizing that he does not want to provide satisfaction to ""fake news"" outlets by firing a key figure in his administration.","The lawsuit was filed in US District Court in Washington, DC.

Sheyla Baez Ramirez , garrison commander of Fort McCoy in Wisconsin, after images of President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth were missing from the base’s chain of command display.The Army confirmed the suspension Monday but clarified, “This suspension is not related to any misconduct. We have no further details to provide at this time while this matter is under review,” the US Army Reserve Command said in a statement.The move follows social media outrage and a formal investigation launched by the Department of Defense (DOD) into why the display wall featured empty frames where the images of Trump, Vance, and Hegseth should have appeared. The incident gained attention after Hegseth reposted a message on X that stated: “Commander of Fort McCoy, whose base chain-of-command board was missing photos of Trump, Vance and Hegseth, has been SUSPENDED.”Shortly afterward, a new image was posted showing the wall had been updated. “Regarding the Ft. McCoy Chain of Command wall controversy… WE FIXED IT! Also, an investigation has begun to figure out exactly what happened,” the Pentagon’s rapid response team wrote on X.Ramirez took over as garrison commander in July 2024 and had previously served in key roles, including at Fort Belvoir, Virginia.Her suspension comes amid broader leadership upheavals in the military. Earlier this month, Col. Susannah Meyers was removed from command at Pituffik Space Force Base in Greenland after internal backlash to an email in which she distanced herself from remarks made by Vice President Vance during a visit. The Space Force cited a “loss of confidence in her ability to lead.”In a separate controversy, Hegseth dismissed four aides last week following tensions over internal leaks tied to a second Signal group chat discussing Houthi strikes. The chat reportedly included Hegseth’s wife, brother, and personal lawyer. Hegseth attributed the leak to “disgruntled employees.”","Col.

Who is the Camerlengo? the man now at the helm of the Vatican after Pope Francis' death,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-the-camerlengo-the-man-now-at-the-helm-of-the-vatican-after-pope-francis-death/articleshow/120486106.cms,"Cardinal Camerlengo Kevin Joseph Farrell announces the death of Pope Francis at the Vatican.

Who is the Camerlengo?

As the first Jesuit and Latin American pontiff, Pope Francis , died on Easter Monday at the age of 88, the responsibility of leading the Catholic Church has fallen to Cardinal Kevin Farrell , the Vatican 's camerlengo , during its period of mourning and transition.It was Farrell who stood before the world to deliver sombre news from the Vatican, ""The Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the Father’s house."" He is an Irish-born cardinal and longtime ally of the late pontiff.As camerlengo, Farrell has now assumed an important administrative role in Vatican to oversee the Church's daily operations and preparing for the election of a new pope.""Dearest brothers and sisters, with deep sorrow, I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis,"" Farrell said. ""At 7:35 this morning, The Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the Father’s house… With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul of Pope Francis to the infinite merciful love of God."" he added while delivering the news of Francis's death.As the papal throne is now vacant, Cardinal Farrell has assumed an important role that is vital to the Church's continuity. As camerlengo — or chamberlain — he becomes the acting head of the Vatican during the "" sede vacante ,"" the period between the death (or resignation) of a pope and the election of a new one.The camerlengo's first official duty is to verify the pope's death and draw up the death certificate. Farrell will also place ceremonial seals on the pope's bedroom and study and begin preparations for the funeral, which is expected to draw global dignitaries and millions of mourners.But his role doesn't end there. Over the coming weeks, Farrell will oversee the day-to-day administration of the Holy See, chairing a committee of three other cardinals and coordinating with Vatican officials to ensure the smooth functioning of Church affairs.Pope Francis, the first Latin American pontiff and a global religious leader known for his humility, compassion, and progressive stance on social issues, died on Monday at the age of 88, the Vatican announced. His death followed a prolonged battle with respiratory illness and marks the end of a historic 12-year papacy that left a deep imprint on the Catholic Church and the world.The Argentine-born pope had been hospitalised at Rome's Gemelli hospital since February 14, 2025, with a severe respiratory crisis that developed into double pneumonia. It was the longest hospitalisation of his papacy, lasting 38 days. Francis had long suffered from lung complications, having had part of one lung removed in his youth.World leaders including PM Modi, former US President Joe Biden, US Vice President JD Vance, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, French President Emmanuel Macron, Israeli President Isaac Herzog and others mourned Pope Francis.","Cardinal Kevin Farrell is the Vatican's camerlengo, or chamberlain.

"Woe is the pinata, a casualty of Trump trade war",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/woe-is-the-pinata-a-casualty-of-trump-trade-war/articleshow/120503594.cms,"Woe is the pinata, a casualty of Trump trade war (Credits: AP)

The humble pinata has become one of the latest targets to take a whacking in US President Donald Trump's trade war.Party store owner Patricia Loperena said she has supplied fewer parties this year than last, which means she is selling fewer of the colorful candy-filled papier mache favors at her southern California establishment.Another blow to Loperena's business? The rising cost of the raw materials to make trinkets and custom pinatas, a traditional game of Latino children's parties that are now popular in much of the United States.""People stop spending. Instead of, like, making a bigger party, they make it a lot smaller,"" the 45-year-old told AFP.Prices are jumping, and that has customers on edge. ""They just know there's a lot of unpredictability, and they just want to be cautious,"" she said.They are spending less overall because of jitters over how Trump's policies will unfold.Loperena is worried about Trump's new tariffs, too -- especially the outright trade war underway with China.To adjust and help protect Ollin Party Store in this Los Angeles suburb, Loperena has already placed supply orders early to get ahead of the tariffs and build up inventory.That may help keep her prices stable for a few months but Loperena's supplier -- based in the United States, selling imported products -- has already warned that the next order will be pricier.Most of the napkins, plates, balloons and other goods in her store are labeled ""Made in China.""Some might say tariff policy has been a pinata-esque moving target under Trump -- chaotic swings followed by an economy that has taken a beating.On what he called ""Liberation Day"" in early April, Trump dramatically hiked levies globally, standing with a chart of country-specific tariff rates to announce a new era.He threatened allies and close trading partners like Canada and Mexico.Then he slapped tariffs on much of the world, including triple digit ones against China. Trump has since lessened many of the immediate levies to 10 percent, saying a 90-day suspension was needed to negotiate.That leaves American business owners dangling in suspense to see what happens next.In the San Fernando Valley, many small businesses like Loperena's were already struggling to compete with online outlets.Service providers and retailers all depend on imports to one extent or another, for parts or products.""Everything comes from overseas, from China, Taiwan and stuff,"" said Angel De Luna, who runs a store that sells sewing machines and vacuum cleaners.For this 28-year-old taking over his father's shop, which survives not so much on sales but on repairing and servicing appliances people already own, the tariffs are shaping up to be the last straw.""We're just hanging in there the best we can,"" said De Luna. ""But it's probably going to get worse.""The service sector is not immune either to Trump's trade war, and neither are his supporters.While the president says he is fighting unfair trading practices to erase trade deficits, many are bracing for bad economic news.OJ Longmire, 46, owns a popular barbershop and beauty parlor in the valley and says tariffs hurt him too.""It definitely affects us all. You know, supplies, everything here on my station. Clippers. I don't believe this is American made,"" he said, pointing to the equipment, gels and lotions he works with to do people's hair.Marcos Ochoa, owner of a small hardware and gardening products store, said people are ""going crazy"" with tariff uncertainty.""Because we don't know what to expect. You don't know if you're going to buy at higher prices,"" said Ochoa.Ochoa, who imports his products mainly from Japan and Europe, said his costs have not yet risen and it is too early to say what the future holds.But he has advice for Trump.""He needs to stop and think what he's gonna say or what he's gonna do before he acts, like, automatically,"" said Ochoa.He voted for Trump in the belief it would be good for business. Now, he has his doubts.""He was good four years ago,"" Ochoa said. ""Now I don't know. He's making a lot of enemies, that's for sure.""","Party store owner Patricia Loperena says she has supplied fewer parties this year than last.

The US Justice Department on Monday announced it was charging 27 people accused of being connected to Venezuelan drug gang Tren de Aragua with an array of serious crimes, including drug conspiracy, sex trafficking and murder.Acting US Attorney for New York's Southern District Matthew Podolsky said those charged included alleged members, former members, and associates of Tren de Aragua,"" a gang designated by US President Donald Trump as a ""foreign terrorist organization.""Of the 27 defendants, 21 were in federal custody and five more were arrested Sunday and Monday in New York and other jurisdictions, the statement said.The charges include murder, shootings, human trafficking of women into sex work, extortion and drug trafficking , the department said.Tren de Aragua became a high-profile target of law enforcement under the Trump administration after the president declared the group a ""terrorist"" organization and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, saying the United States was facing an ""invasion.""Since then, Trump has sent two planeloads of alleged members to a prison in El Salvador on March 15 -- a case that led to a standoff with US courts.Attorneys for several of the deported Venezuelans have said that their clients were not members of Tren de Aragua, had committed no crimes and were targeted largely on the basis of their tattoos.Despite facing challenges, the US Supreme Court lifted a lower court order barring the deportations on April 7, handing Trump a long-sought political victory.The court did note, however, that the deportees must be given an opportunity to legally challenge their removal -- a requirement that Trump has called unworkable.""We cannot give everyone a trial, because to do so would take, without exaggeration, 200 years,"" the US president said in a social media post on Monday.","The charges include murder, shootings, human trafficking of women into sex work, extortion and drug trafficking.

The verdict comes months after Bob Menendez himself was convicted on related charges; the 71-year-old Democrat is scheduled to begin his 11-year prison sentence in June.Nadine Menendez, 58, who remained emotionless as the verdict was read, is due to be sentenced on June 12 — just six days after her husband is expected to report to prison.Outside the courthouse, her attorney Barry Coburn said, “We fought hard and it hurts. This is a very rough day for us.” He added he was “devastated by the verdict.”During the trial, prosecutors described the couple as “partners in crime,” alleging that the scheme began in 2018 as their romantic relationship developed. FBI agents discovered $480,000 in cash and $150,000 worth of gold bars during a 2022 raid on their New Jersey home, along with the luxury car allegedly gifted as a bribe.Prosecutors said Nadine Menendez facilitated bribes in exchange for her husband’s influence, including efforts to halt investigations, maintain business monopolies, and assist in securing foreign investments. She allegedly began soliciting bribes from Wael Hana, Jose Uribe, and Fred Daibes—each of whom received favourable treatment from the senator, including pressuring the New Jersey attorney general and supporting a $95 million investment deal with Qatari officials.In court, it was revealed that Nadine was facing foreclosure when Hana allegedly gave her cash to cover mortgage payments. Uribe also gifted her a Mercedes-Benz after her previous car was destroyed in a fatal crash (she was not charged in connection with the accident).Prosecutors said the couple received bribes in return for actions such as ghostwriting a letter for Egyptian officials to sway US lawmakers on military aid. Bob Menendez was also convicted of acting as an unregistered agent for Egypt.Coburn maintained her innocence during closing arguments, insisting that “These things we’re talking about here are unproven.” He argued that the senator’s dealings amounted to routine constituent services.But Assistant US Attorney Daniel Richenthal countered, calling the evidence “consistent and overwhelming.”All three businessmen—Hana, Uribe, and Daibes—were convicted. Uribe testified after pleading guilty, while Hana and Daibes received sentences of eight and seven years respectively.Acting US Attorney Matthew Podolsky said the outcome “sends the clear message that the power of government officials may not be put up for sale and that all those who facilitate corruption will be held accountable.”(This is a top Google Trends topic)","Nadine Menendez found guilty on all counts after three-week trial.

US education secretary Linda McMahon announced on Monday that the education department will begin debt collection on student loans which are in default.

Mob lynches Ahmadi businessman in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/mob-lynches-ahmadi-businessman-in-karachi/articleshow/120494757.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The death of Laeeq Cheema , a 47-year-old Ahmadi businessman, killed by a frenzied mob for praying in a Karachi worship hall, has ignited outrage, exposing the relentless persecution of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya community.The attack, led by activists of the far-right Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) enraged over Cheema allegedly filming them on Sunday, underscores a state-backed system of bigotry.Pakistan’s 500,000 Ahmadis face an apartheid-like existence, stripped of religious freedom since the 1974 second amendment to the constitution declared them non-Muslims. Ordinance XX of 1984 bans Ahmadis from identifying as Muslims or using Islamic symbols, with violations risking imprisonment or death under blasphemy laws. Over 4,100 Ahmadis have faced charges since, including 335 for blasphemy, fuelled by TLP’s hate-filled rhetoric at Khatm-e-Nabuwat conferences. Urdu media and businesses amplify this bigotry, with shops in Punjab and Sindh refusing service to Ahmadis.The Karachi lynching is not isolated. In 2023, 34 attacks targeted Ahmadi worship sites, with police often complicit, demolishing graves or detaining victims instead of attackers.After Cheema’s killing, a TLP-affiliated union council chairman and over a dozen others were arrested, but justice remains doubtful. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan condemned police for taking 25 Ahmadis into “protective custody”, calling it state-enabled persecution. Posts on X labeled it “religious apartheid”.The military, though not directly involved, shares blame for this impunity. General Zia-ul-Haq’s 1980s Islamisation policies entrenched anti-Ahmadi laws, and the military’s political dominance lets groups like TLP thrive. The state’s inaction against TLP’s violent campaigns, like the 2017 Islamabad sit-in, emboldens mobs. Last June, 11 Ahmadis in Punjab faced FIRs after TLP complaints, with police caving to extremists.Ahmadis live in fear, hiding their identities to avoid harassment, job loss, or violence. Many boycott censuses, shun public worship, and face grave desecration. Cheema’s death highlights their vulnerability, with women especially trapped by religious and gender discrimination.","Laeeq Cheema, a 47-year-old Ahmadi businessman, killed by a frenzied mob for praying in a Karachi worship hall.

Poll Should the federal government halt the canal project in response to protests? No, it should continue Yes, it should be halted

A Pakistani Hindu state minister was attacked with tomatoes and potatoes in Sindh on Saturday by protesters opposing the federal government’s proposed canal projects, which critics say will reduce the province’s share of irrigation water.Kheal Das Kohistani , state minister for religious affairs in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, was targeted by a group of demonstrators in Thatta district, however, he remained unharmed.The attack, which took place amid rising tensions over the Green Pakistan Initiative , drew swift condemnation from both federal and provincial authorities. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif termed the assault on Kohistani “unacceptable” and assured of “a thorough investigation” into the incident. “The attack on the public representatives is unacceptable. The persons involved in the incident would be given exemplary punishment,” he said.Federal information minister Atta Tarar also called it “an attack” and sought a report from the Sindh Inspector General of Police and the federal interior secretary.Sindh chief minister Syed Murad Ali Shah issued a stern warning against taking the law into one’s own hands and instructed Hyderabad’s deputy inspector general to arrest the culprits immediately.Kohistani, a member of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), hails from Sindh’s Jamshoro district and was first elected to parliament in 2018. He returned to the National Assembly in 2024 and was later appointed as a state minister.The protestors chanted slogans against the PML-N-led federal government, accusing it of threatening Sindh’s agricultural livelihood by backing controversial canal projects in Punjab under the Green Pakistan Initiative.The plan, supported by the federal government, Punjab authorities and the military, includes the construction of six new canals to irrigate Cholistan. Opponents argue it will cut downriver water flow to Sindh, worsening irrigation issues in the province.Political tensions flared further after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari issued a strong warning to the PML-N at a rally in Hyderabad. He said the PPP would withdraw support from the federal government if the canal plan wasn’t shelved.In response, PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif directed the federal government to initiate talks with the PPP to resolve the dispute amicably.Rana Sanaullah, a senior PML-N leader and adviser to the prime minister, later stated, “Politics should not be played over the issue of water. Matters must be resolved through dialogue.” He reiterated that the 1991 Water Accord and 1992 IRSA Act protect inter-provincial water rights.","Kheal Das Kohistani, state minister for religious affairs in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, was targeted by a group of demonstrators in Thatta district.

"‘No right to appeal for Kulbhushan Jadhav’: ICJ only granted consular access, Pakistan SC told",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-right-to-appeal-for-kulbhushan-jadhav-icj-only-granted-consular-access-pakistan-sc-told/articleshow/120450503.cms,"Poll Do you believe Kulbhushan Jadhav should have the right to appeal his conviction? No, the conviction should stand Yes, he deserves an appeal

The Pakistani Supreme Court was told on Wednesday that Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav was never granted the right to appeal his conviction because the 2019 ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) only required consular access , not a legal right to challenge his sentence, the Dawn reported.Pak defence ministry counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed, appearing before a seven-judge constitutional bench, said the ICJ ruling did not obligate Pakistan to provide Jadhav, who was convicted of espionage and terrorism, with an automatic right to appeal. “The ICJ verdict addressed only the consular access issue under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention. It never directed Pakistan to extend appeal rights,” he told the court.The bench is currently hearing 38 intra-court appeals, including from the federal and provincial governments, against the Supreme Court’s October 2023 judgment that struck down military trials for civilians involved in the May 9 riots.Responding to criticism that Pakistani citizens convicted by military courts after the May 9 violence are not being given the same appeal options as Jadhav, Haris argued that Pakistan’s 2021 ICJ (Review and Re-consideration) Act was a “unique jurisdiction” created specifically for compliance with the ICJ ruling, not a general legal provision.The Dawn reported Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar pointed out that the ICJ law stemmed from earlier Pakistani court rulings like the 2017 Said Zaman Khan case, which had expanded the rights of the accused. Justice Musarrat Hilali added that the Said Zaman ruling, initially contested by the government, was eventually cited in Pakistan’s defence before the ICJ.The case of Jadhav, a former Indian Navy officer, remains one of the most high-profile legal controversies between India and Pakistan. Captured in Balochistan in 2016, Jadhav was sentenced to death by a military court in 2017. India moved the ICJ, which ordered Pakistan to grant him consular access but stopped short of overturning the conviction.Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan is expected to weigh in on whether Pakistani civilians tried in military courts post-May 9 should be allowed to appeal, a decision that could have broader implications for the ongoing constitutional debate.Justice Jamal Mandokhail pressed the government on whether military court proceedings can begin without filing a formal FIR. The counsel replied that under Section 157 of the Pakistan Army Act, a court of inquiry can initiate proceedings and no FIR is needed.","Pakistani Supreme Court told Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav was never granted the right to appeal his conviction.

Poll Do you support Pakistan's recent deportation of Afghan refugees? No, it harms vulnerable families. Yes, it's necessary for national security.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar met Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul on Saturday to mend frayed bilateral ties strained by security concerns and the contentious repatriation of Afghan refugees.The high-level talks, which included meeting with Afghan interim prime minister Mullah Muhammad Hassan Akhund and other officials, focused on trade, security and people-to-people ties, but the shadow of Pakistan’s intensified deportation drive loomed large, particularly for low-income Afghans facing upheaval.The visit, described by Pakistan’s foreign office as a “reflection of commitment to enhance sustained engagement”, follows a recent Pak-Afghan joint coordination committee meeting in Kabul. Dar emphasised “brotherly ties” and opportunities for trade, stating, “Our link with Central Asia depends on Afghanistan as a partner.”However, the talks come as Pakistan has expelled over 80,000 Afghans since April 1, targeting those deemed “illegal”, including many low-income families integrated into Pakistani society for decades.Afghanistan’s foreign ministry expressed deep concerns over the expulsions, with Muttaqi urging “dialogue based on trust” to resolve the issue. “The forced deportation of Afghans is unacceptable and undermines mutual respect,” he said, highlighting the plight of vulnerable returnees facing economic hardship and insecurity in Afghanistan.Since Nov 2023, Pakistan has repatriated 907,000 Afghans, with 44,000 still awaiting relocation to Western countries.In Pakistan’s border regions, low-income Afghan families, many of whom fled conflict decades ago, face acute distress. Akbar Khan, a Peshawar restaurant owner, said, “I’ve been here 50 years. This is my home, but now we’re being uprooted.” The rugged border terrain complicates enforcement, with many returnees using illegal channels to re-enter Pakistan.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister met Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul.

Tensions quickly escalated when the group accused the minority community of violating Pakistan’s controversial anti-Ahmadi laws.“One member of the community was killed after the mob identified him as an Ahmadi,” said Muhammad Safdar, a senior police official in Karachi.“They attacked him with sticks and bricks.”Police said members of several religious parties were part of the mob. To protect others from further violence, officers took around 25 Ahmadis into custody and moved them away in a police-escorted van after negotiating with the crowd, which had swelled to around 600 people.The Ahmadiyya community, considered heretical by Pakistan’s state and many religious groups, has long faced systemic discrimination. Ahmadis, who have a population of almost 10 million worldwide, consider themselves Muslims and have faith identical to mainstream Islam in almost every manner. Though they regard themselves as Muslim, a 1974 constitutional amendment declared them non-Muslim, and a 1984 ordinance criminalised many of their religious practices.Friday’s killing is the latest in a long history of persecution. According to community records, six Ahmadis have been killed in 2024 so far, with over 280 killed since 1984. Thousands more have faced criminal charges, including hundreds under Pakistan’s harsh blasphemy laws.Abdul Qadir Ashrafi, a 52-year-old businessman who took part in the protest, said the group’s intention was to pressure police to act against the Ahmadis.“We requested that the place be sealed and that those conducting the Friday prayers be arrested, with criminal proceedings initiated against them,” he told AFP.The human rights commission of Pakistan condemned the attack, saying it was ""appalled by the orchestrated attack by a far-right religious party on a colonial-era Ahmadi place of worship.""“This failure of law and order is a stark reminder of the continued complicity of the state in the systematic persecution of a beleaguered community,” the commission posted on social media platform X.Mob violence has become an all-too-common response to accusations of blasphemy in Pakistan, often with deadly consequences. In a similar incident last year, dozens of churches were torched in the city of Jaranwala after a Christian man was falsely accused of blasphemy.","A member of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya community was beaten to death on Friday after a mob of radical surrounded an Ahmadi place of worship in Karachi. The crowd, having many from the anti blasphemy political groupTehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), forced their way through narrow streets chanting anti-Ahmadi slogans. Police said members of several religious parties were part of the mob.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120412114,imgsize-226416,width-400,resizemode-4/Police-officers-stand-guard-at-outside-the-Pakistans-minority-Ahmadi-communitys-place-of-worship.jpg"

Baloch separatists kill 8 Pakistanis in Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/baloch-separatists-kill-8-pakistanis-in-iran/articleshow/120262403.cms,"ISLAMABAD:

Eight Pakistani car mechanics were shot dead in Iran late Saturday, sparking outrage and deepening fears that the country was becoming a hub for anti-Pakistan militants after Afghanistan.Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack in Sistan-Baluchestan province, escalating tensions between the neighbouring countries as Pakistan demanded swift action. The eight workers hailed from Punjab -- Pakistan’s most populous province -- and were killed at a workshop in Mehrestan district, near Afghanistan’s border, Pakistani authorities said.BNA framed the killings as retaliation against perceived Punjabi dominance in Balochistan’s economic and political spheres. “We will not allow outsiders to exploit our land and resources,” BNA said in an online statement, echoing long-standing Baloch grievances over resource exploitation and marginalisation. The outfit has aligned itself with the broader Baloch insurgency led by groups like Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif called the attack “barbaric”. “We demand the perpetrators be brought to justice swiftly,” he said, urging Tehran to act. Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to help the victims’ families and repatriate the bodies. Foreign minister Ishaq Dar issued a similar condemnation. “This attack challenges our sovereignty. We cannot allow our citizens to be targeted abroad,” Dar said.Iran’s response was measured but conspicuously vague. Ambassador Reza Amiri Moghadam condemned the killings as “inhumane and cowardly”, calling terrorism a “chronic plight” that demands regional cooperation. Yet, Tehran offered no concrete assurances of cracking down on groups like BNA, prompting scepticism in Islamabad.Thousands of Pakistanis, particularly from economically deprived areas, travel to Iran on a regular basis to take up informal jobs in sectors such as vehicle repairs, construction, and agriculture.In Jan 2024, nine Pakistani labourers were killed and three critically injured in a similar attack in Saravancity, also located in Iran’s southeastern border region. Like in the latest killings, the victims in that case worked in an automobile repair shop. These murders occurred at a time when Pakistan and Iran were attempting to repair diplomatic relations after tit-for-tat missile and drone attacks.","Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack.

Poll Do you believe that Pakistan is adequately prepared for earthquakes? No Yes

A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.Tremors were felt across many parts of the Valley, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or property damage. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres, with coordinates of 33.63 degrees North latitude and 72.46 degrees East longitude.According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the recent earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 10km, increasing the likelihood of aftershocks.Shallow earthquakes are typically more dangerous than deeper ones because the seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface, causing stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and higher casualties.Pakistan, located on the boundary of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, is one of the most seismically active countries. The nation frequently experiences destructive earthquakes due to its position on major fault lines. Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are on the north-western edge of the Indian plate. The collision of these plates makes the region highly susceptible to violent earthquakes.Earlier, Pakistan’s neighbor Tajikistan was also jolted by a 4.2 magnitude earthquake.","A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.Hundreds, including Christian, Buddhist, Hindu and Islamic religious figures, attended a vigil Monday in memory of the victims at the church of St. Anthony, targeted in the attacks.Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, told the attendees Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, prefect of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints in the Vatican, has included the names of 167 catholics who died in the bombings in the churches of St. Anthony in Colombo and St. Sebastian in Negombo ""in the catalogue of the witnesses of the faith in its order book, considering the context of their heroism.""He said they were chosen ""due to violent opposition to their faith motivated by 'odium fidei,' the hate of the faith."" Ranjith also said seven victims of other faiths were ""respectfully remembered.""Witnesses of faith are those who sacrificed their lives for their belief. Pope Francis formalized in 2023 a new category of recognition by the church of people who lost their lives while professing the catholic faith and created a special Vatican commission to catalogue their cases. The commission, based in the Vatican's saint-making office, has gathered hundreds of cases, with a view to highlighting them alongside officially recognized martyrs of the church, who are on the path to possible beatification or sainthood.More than 260 people, including 42 foreigners, were killed in the near-simultaneous bombings during Easter Sunday at three tourist hotels and three churches, two Catholic and one Protestant, on April 21, 2019.The catholic church in Sri Lanka has demanded further probing in the attacks, particularly after British television Channel 4 interviewed a man who said that he arranged a meeting between a local IS-inspired group, National Thowheed Jamath, and a top state intelligence official to hatch a plot to create insecurity in Sri Lanka and enable former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to win the presidential election later that year.","Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.

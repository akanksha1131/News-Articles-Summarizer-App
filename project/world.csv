'Will Sell To China, Russia': Trump Lays Out Plans For Venezuelan Oil After Maduro Capture

.

Why did the US attack and capture Maduro?





The United States carried out pre-dawn airstrikes across Venezuela on Saturday, with at least seven explosions and low-flying aircraft reported over the capital, Caracas. The attacks, which killed at least 40 people, prompted the Venezuelan government to declare a national emergency and deploy its armed forces, calling for mass mobilisation. Hours later, US President Donald Trump announced that American forces had captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, flown them out of the country, and placed them in US custody.Trump later posted an image on his Truth Social platform showing a blindfolded Maduro aboard a US warship, captioned: “Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima.”The US justice department said Maduro and Flores will face trial in New York after a fresh indictment issued on Saturday accused them of involvement in narco-terrorism, The Guardian reported. US Attorney General Pam Bondi said the couple had been charged with drug- and weapons-related offences.At least seven explosions and low-flying aircraft were reported over Caracas, including near military bases, BBC News and AP said. Venezuelan authorities accused the US of striking civilian and military installations and urged citizens to take to the streets.Calling it the most direct US military action in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama, The Guardian noted the operation stunned the international community.Despite Trump’s claim that the US would decide Venezuela’s future, Venezuelan state television continued broadcasting pro-government messages, while the military appeared to retain control over key installations.Speaking at a Mar-a-Lago news conference, US President Donald Trump said the US would temporarily govern Venezuela. “We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” he said, adding that American oil companies would move into the country. Trump boasted that “no nation in the world could achieve what America achieved"", AP reported.The strikes and capture followed months of an aggressive US pressure campaign mounted on Venezuela's Maduro after US President Donald Trump took office for a second term.According to the BBC News, Trump has repeatedly accused Maduro of fueling illegal immigration into the US and being responsible for the movement of drugs including fentanyl and cocaine into American cities, claims experts have said lack public evidence. Trump has portrayed Venezuela’s government as illegitimate and blamed it for destabilising the region.The US designated Venezuelan gangs such as Tren de Aragua and Cartel de los Soles as terrorist organisations and alleged that the latter was led by Maduro himself. Washington had earlier announced a $50 million bounty for information leading to Maduro’s arrest.Over recent months, US forces carried out more than two dozen strikes in international waters on boats alleged to be carrying drugs.Relations between the two countries have been strained since Hugo Chávez came to power in 1999 and worsened after Maduro succeeded him in 2013. The US stopped recognising Maduro as Venezuela’s legitimate leader in 2019 and backed the opposition. After Venezuela’s disputed 2024 election, which independent experts said the opposition won, Maduro remained in power following a crackdown.Trump has openly spoken about regime change and access to resources. Following Maduro’s capture, he invoked the Monroe Doctrine — which he dubbed the “Don-Roe doctrine” — declaring: “American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again.”The legality of the operation has been questioned, with Congress not having authorised the use of force, AP reported. Venezuela’s Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez demanded Maduro’s release, insisting on state television: “There is only one president in Venezuela, and his name is Nicolás Maduro Moros.”","US carried out pre-dawn airstrikes across Venezuela on Saturday, with at least seven explosions and low-flying aircraft reported over the capital, Caracas.

Maduro Lands In US: FBI Escorts Handcuffed Venezuelan President; THUMBS UP At DEA Office On Cam





The first video of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro arriving in the United States was released on Saturday (local time), showing him handcuffed and escorted by US officials as he stepped off a helicopter at New York’s Stewart Airport.Hours earlier, Maduro was captured by US forces during a late-night operation in Venezuela. US President Donald Trump had also shared the first image of Maduro in custody, showing him handcuffed and blindfolded aboard a US warship.After landing in New York, a motorcade believed to be carrying Maduro exited the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) headquarters on Manhattan’s West Side Highway before briefly heading north and then returning to a heliport, according to BBC.Officials said Maduro and his wife, First Lady Cilia Flores, were flown by helicopter to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. Three helicopters were seen travelling down the Hudson River, passing the Statue of Liberty, before landing. From there, the couple were transported to the detention facility in a convoy of law enforcement vehicles.According to US authorities, Maduro was arrested in Venezuela and flown out of the capital, Caracas, in the early hours of Saturday aboard a US helicopter.He was first taken to the USS Iwo Jima at an undisclosed location in the Caribbean Sea.From there, he was flown to the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, before being transferred to another aircraft that took him to Stewart Air Force Base in New York State’s Orange County. He was then flown by helicopter into New York City.In total, Maduro travelled about 2,100 miles (3,300 kilometres) from his capture in Venezuela to his arrival in the United States.Also read: Nicolas Maduro captured; w​ho is in charge of Venezuela now? Trump says US will 'run' the country​​​ US Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed that Nicolás Maduro and Cilia Flores have been indicted in the Southern District of New York.The charges include conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess such weapons against the US.US media reports said that the booking process for the couple has already begun. This includes taking fingerprints, biometric data and mugshots, along with medical examinations. Their details will then be entered into the US Customs and Border Protection system.Maduro and his wife are expected to be formally produced in court, possibly as early as Monday.Earlier, Trump had shared the first image of Maduro following his capture, posting a photograph of the Venezuelan leader aboard the USS Iwo Jima. “Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.Speaking later on Fox and Friends Weekend, Trump said Maduro and Flores were seized during a night-time operation and flown directly to a US warship. He claimed Maduro had been heavily guarded inside a fortified palace and that US forces had rehearsed the operation in advance.The operation reportedly lasted less than 30 minutes and took place amid explosions in Caracas and other locations. Venezuela’s government condemned the action as a “serious military aggression” and declared a state of emergency, while the US said its forces suffered minimal casualties. Maduro now remains in US custody as legal proceedings move forward in New York.The White House’s official Rapid Response account later posted a video showing what appeared to be a “perp walk” of the ousted Venezuelan leader at the DEA office in Manhattan.The video showed Maduro wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and walking handcuffed alongside DEA agents down a blue-carpeted hallway marked “DEA NYD,” according to CNN.The footage showed Maduro being processed and fingerprinted at the DEA office. As he walked with agents, Maduro appeared to attempt speaking in English.“Good night,” he said, before correcting himself in Spanish: “Es buenas noches, no?” — meaning, “That is good night, no?”He then repeated “good night” to those present and added, “Happy New Year”.","First video of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro arriving in the United States released.

Newly inaugurated New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani on Saturday condemned the US military capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.The socialist democrat called it an ""act of war and a violation of federal and international law.""At a news conference, Mamdani said he had spoken to US President Donald Trump by phone to voice his opposition to the military operation and the attempt to change Venezuela’s government.Mamdani said: ""I called the president and spoke with him directly to register my opposition to this act and to make clear that it was an opposition based on being opposed to a pursuit of regime change, to the violation of federal international law and a desire to see that be consistent each and every day. I registered my opposition, I made it clear and we left it at that.""US President Trump had announced the capture earlier in the day, describing it as a ""large scale strike"" following months of US assaults on suspected drug vessels allegedly tied to the Venezuelan regime in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific. The Venezuelan government issued a statement condemning the attack, describing it as an ""attempt to impose a colonial war to destroy the republican form of government and force a ‘regime change,’ in alliance with the fascist oligarchy.Mamdani later took to X to highlight the potential impact on New Yorkers, particularly the city’s tens of thousands of Venezuelan residents. ""This blatant pursuit of regime change doesn’t just affect those abroad, it directly impacts New Yorkers, including tens of thousands of Venezuelans who call this city home. My focus is their safety and the safety of every New Yorker, and my administration will continue to monitor the situation and issue relevant guidance,"" he said.The mayor is a democratic socialist who shares some policy similarities with Maduro, including a focus on redistributing wealth.Mamdani has campaigned on taxing the wealthy and corporations to fund public services, while Maduro redistributed wealth through oil revenues and state control of resources. However, Venezuelan socialism has involved nationalisation and centralised control, contributing to economic collapse and authoritarian practices, unlike Mamdani’s localised policy agenda focused on public housing, childcare, transit and city-owned grocery stores, according to Fox News.","Newly inaugurated New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani condemned the US military capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reacted to the US operation in Venezuela and said that “If it’s possible to deal with dictators this way, then the US knows what to do next. ”The comment came during a news conference after he met with European national security advisors, according to ABC News. Zelenskyy did not mention anyone by name, but social media noted he likely had Russia and the ongoing war in Ukraine in mind.His comment drew laughter from reporters in the room.The statement comes as US President Donald Trump announced that American forces had captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife in an overnight raid in Caracas.Trump said a team including secretary of state Marco Rubio and secretary of defence Pete Hegseth, working with Venezuelan officials, would oversee the country. “We are going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” he said.The MAGA chief also claimed that the military operation was part of his “America First” priorities, claiming it would protect US regional security and secure a steady source of oil and help increase business.Trump also compared the operation to past conflicts, like the Ukraine-Russia one, saying, “When I watch that war in Russia going on and on and on and everybody dying. It’s primitive. It’s horrible. It’s horrible, it’s really horrible.”The GOP leader pledged that American energy companies would help rebuild Venezuela’s infrastructure and did not rule out sending troops back if necessary. “We’re not afraid of boots on the ground…we had boots on the ground last night,” he told reporters.Meanwhile, China condemned the operation as reckless, while some Republican lawmakers supported Trump’s move. Democrats expressed concern over the lack of congressional consultation and the risk of a full-fledged war.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reacted to the US operation in Venezuela.

After President Donald Trump announced that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had been captured, attention has shifted to where the Latin American leader could be detained while he awaits trial in United States.Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, are currently in US custody and are being taken to New York, where they are expected to face criminal charges, a senior government source told NewsNation.US Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed after the capture that the couple has been indicted on narco-terrorism, drug trafficking and weapons-related charges.“Maduro and his wife will soon face the full might of American justice and stand trial on American soil,” Trump said.With Trump indicating that Maduro will be taken to New York, officials say he could be held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, the city’s only federal jail. The facility has previously held several high-profile detainees, including music executive Sean “Diddy” Combs.The Metropolitan Detention Center has a troubled reputation. Inmates have repeatedly complained about violence, harsh living conditions, staff shortages and the smuggling of drugs and other contraband.Some detainees have described the jail as “hell on earth”. Past inmates have included R. Kelly, Ghislaine Maxwell and cryptocurrency fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried.Combs himself spent time at the Brooklyn facility before and during his trial. He is now serving a 50-month federal prison sentence after being convicted in October 2025 on two counts of transporting individuals across state lines for prostitution. He was acquitted of more serious sex trafficking and racketeering charges and is currently held at a federal prison in New Jersey.Maduro, his wife and close associates have been indicted in the Southern District of New York. Prosecutors allege that he led a long-running narco-terrorism conspiracy that used Venezuela’s state apparatus to funnel large quantities of cocaine into US. The charges include narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, and possession of machineguns and destructive devices. Maduro’s son, Nicolás Ernesto Maduro Guerra, is also named in the indictment.","Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, are currently in US custody and are being taken to New York, where they are expected to face criminal charges.

An old social media post by US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has resurfaced and gone viral after the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by American forces, with social media saying that the comment “didn’t age well”.On January 25, 2019, Gabbard wrote on X, then Twitter that US must not intervene in the future of Venezuela: “The United States needs to stay out of Venezuela. Let the Venezuelan people determine their future. We don't want other countries to choose our leaders, so we have to stop trying to choose theirs.”The post has now gone viral again, as Washington confirms a major military operation in Venezuela that led to Maduro’s arrest and the bombing of several parts in the Latin American country.Gabbard is a veteran of the Iraq war and has long opposed US intervention overseas. She has consistently argued against deploying American troops in other countries in the past. Her views put her at odds with both Democratic and Republican administrations that supported pressure, sanctions or regime change efforts against Caracas.During the political crisis in Venezuela in 2019, when the US backed opposition leader Juan Guaidó, Gabbard warned that American involvement would worsen instability and suffering for ordinary Venezuelans.She argued that foreign interference rarely produces democratic outcomes and often leads to long-term chaos, like in Afghanistan and Iraq.Her position was opposite to President Donald Trump, who described Maduro as “illegitimate” back then and said Venezuela’s opposition-led National Assembly was “the only legitimate branch of government duly elected by the Venezuelan people”. Trump openly backed Guaidó at the time and pushed for stronger action against Maduro’s government.Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna also criticised the Trump administration’s Venezuela policy in 2019. “The United States should not anoint the leader of the opposition in Venezuela during an internal, divided conflict.""After the latest US action in Venezuela, Tulsi did not immediately acknowledge the invasion as several political leaders did across party lines. Her silence was noticed by netizens, who called her out over her earlier position.","Gabbard is a veteran of the Iraq war and has long opposed US intervention overseas.

US President Donald Trump invited Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to visit the United States during a phone call on Friday, Japan’s foreign ministry said.The foreign ministry added that the two leaders agreed to coordinate arrangements for a spring visit, which would be Takaichi’s first trip to the US since she took office in October. Kyodo News reported that Japanese officials have proposed late March for the visit, with the schedule possibly aligning with Washington’s annual cherry blossom festival.According to Kyodo News, the call lasted about 25 minutes and focused mainly on developments in the Indo-Pacific region. Takaichi told reporters that she and Trump confirmed the strength of the Japan-US alliance and agreed to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific, as well as cooperation among like-minded countries, including the Japan-US-South Korea partnership.However, the White House has not yet confirmed the call or the invitation, according to the AP.“At the start of the new year, I consider it extremely significant that I was able to exchange words directly with President Trump and confirm the strong partnership of the Japan-US alliance,” Takaichi was quoted as saying by Kyodo News.In its statement, Japan’s foreign ministry said the two leaders affirmed they would “carve out a new chapter in the history of the Japan-U.S.alliance” in a year when the United States marks the 250th anniversary of its independence. They also agreed to further deepen wide-ranging cooperation and friendly relations, including in the economic and security spheres.Takaichi said she conveyed her congratulations to Trump on the milestone anniversary. Kyodo News noted that Japan has pledged to gift 250 cherry trees to the United States as part of the commemorations, building on the tradition that began with Tokyo’s 1912 gift of cherry trees to Washington.The call came against the backdrop of strained regional relations between Japan and China. Beijing staged two-day military exercises in waters off Taiwan this week, AP reported. The drills followed the Trump administration’s announcement of a proposed arms sales package to Taiwan valued at more than $11 billion, which, if approved by Congress, would represent the largest such assistance to the island. China criticised the move sharply.China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and has vowed to seize the self-governed island by force if necessary. The United States is required under domestic law to provide Taiwan with sufficient defence equipment to deter any attack from the mainland.Takaichi, Japan’s first female prime minister, angered Beijing late last year when she said Chinese military action against Taiwan could justify a Japanese military response, departing from the strategic ambiguity maintained by previous leaders.Trump met Takaichi in Tokyo in October shortly after she took office and later addressed US troops aboard an aircraft carrier alongside her. After her remarks on Taiwan drew criticism from Beijing, Trump called her and described them as “extremely good friends” and that she should call him anytime, according to the Japanese leader, Kyodo News reported.","US President Donald Trump invited Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to visit the United States during a phone call on Friday.

Zohran Mamdani Takes Oath On Quran In Historic First As New York Muslim Mayor | WATCH

.





Less than 24 hours after taking the oath, New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani began his first full day in office with a routine familiar to millions of New Yorkers, a morning subway commute from his Queens apartment.Battling against the cold, the 34-year-old Democrat left the one-bedroom apartment in Queens on Friday. Unlike most commuters, Mamdani’s journey was documented by a photo and video crew with neighbors stopping to wish him luck as he headed to work.The subway ride came ahead of a busy first day that included signing orders, announcing appointments and facing questions from the press. Still, the mayor chose to begin with what aides described as a deliberately symbolic commute.Flanked by security guards and a small group of aides, Mamdani boarded a Manhattan-bound train, pausing to take selfies with surprised riders before settling into a corner seat to review briefing materials. The video of his subway ride went viral across social media.When two French tourists, puzzled by the attention, approached him, Mamdani introduced himself as “the new mayor of New York.” When met with disbelief, he held up the morning’s New York Daily News, which featured his photograph on the front page, according to the Associated Press.Videos of the subway ride began circulating online within minutes of Mamdani’s arrival at City Hall, drawing widespread attention and praise from supporters who viewed the moment as a reflection of his campaign message.While the ride served as a carefully timed public moment, it also aligned with Mamdani’s inaugural pledge to ensure his “government looks and lives like the people it represents.”Several past New York City mayors, including Eric Adams, Bill de Blasio and Michael Bloomberg, have similarly used public transit early in their terms to signal accessibility and to connect with the residents.Mamdani’s first commute was followed by a history-making swearing-in ceremony on Thursday. The Indian-origin leader became New York City’s first South Asian and Muslim mayor, as well as the second-youngest mayor in the city’s history, after taking his oath during a private ceremony at the historic Old City Hall subway station.In a first for the city, Mamdani was sworn in on a Quran from the New York Public Library’s Schomburg Center collection, marking the first time a New York City mayor has taken the oath of office on Islam’s holy text.",New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani began his first full day in office with a routine familiar to millions of New Yorkers.

At least seven loud explosions were heard across Venezuela’s capital, Caracas (early Saturday), with air sirens and low-flying aircraft adding to the alarm. Several neighborhoods reported panic on the streets and power outages following the blasts.According to AFP, the blasts were heard around 2.00 am local time (0600 GMT). The first explosion was recorded shortly before 1.50 am.“One was so strong, my window was shaking after it,” CNN correspondent Osmary Hernández said.Witnesses reported hearing aircraft overhead following the explosions. Smoke was also visible in the southern part of the city near a major military base, according to Reuters. Videos of the explosions quickly surfaced on social media.President Donald Trump confirmed that US had ordered strikes on sites inside Venezuela, including military facilities. Trump also said that Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro has been captures along with his wife and flown out of the country.The strikes follow months of American military buildup in the region, including the deployment of the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier and several other warships in the Caribbean.The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has banned American commercial flights from operating in Venezuelan airspace, citing concerns over “ongoing military activity,” shortly before a series of explosions were reported in the capital, news agency AP reported.Several areas of Caracas were left without electricity and residents in multiple neighborhoods rushed out onto the streets.Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, earlier declared a national emergency after a series of explosions rocked the capital Caracas. The government accused the United States of carrying out “military aggression” against civilian and military installations across multiple states. The government further for 'mobilization' of the population after US 'attack', news agency AFP reported.In a government statement, Venezuelan authorities said the US had attacked strategic sites in several parts of the country.The incident comes amid heightened regional tensions, as US President Donald Trump has recently deployed a naval task force to the Caribbean and raised the possibility of ground strikes against Venezuela. In recent days, the US military has also been targeting alleged drug-smuggling boats in the region.The US Embassy in Bogotá has issued travel advisory urging US citizens not to travel to Venezuela. In its warning issued, the embassy said Americans currently in Venezuela should shelter in place and leave the country as soon as it is safe to do so.The embassy reminded citizens that Venezuela is under a Level 4 “Do Not Travel” advisory, the highest warning level, citing severe risks including wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, crime, civil unrest and poor health infrastructure.The US Department of State withdrew all diplomatic personnel from its embassy in Caracas in March 2019 and suspended operations. As a result, all consular services, including emergency assistance, remain unavailable and the US government has no ability to provide help to American citizens inside Venezuela.The advisory also urged US citizens to establish multiple ways of communicating with family and friends outside Venezuela and to closely monitor developments as the situation unfolds.Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Saturday posted an official statement from the Venezuelan government, in which Caracas accused the United States of carrying out a serious military attack on Venezuelan territory.“The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela rejects, repudiates, and denounces before the international community the extremely serious military aggression perpetrated by the current Government of the United States of America against Venezuelan territory and population,” the statement read.The statement claimed the alleged attack violated the United Nations Charter, citing Articles 1 and 2 on respect for sovereignty and the prohibition of the use of force, and warned that such actions “threaten international peace and stability, specifically in Latin America and the Caribbean, and put the lives of millions of people at grave risk.”According to the statement shared by Petro, the Venezuelan government said the objective of the alleged attack was “to seize Venezuela’s strategic resources, particularly its oil and minerals” and to undermine the country’s political independence. “They will not succeed,” the statement added.Earlier, Maduro had claimed that he was open to negotiating with the United States on issues including drug trafficking, oil and migration. Speaking in a pre-recorded interview aired on Venezuelan state television on Thursday, Maduro said he was ready for dialogue with Washington “wherever they want and whenever they want.”However, Maduro also accused the US of using its months-long pressure campaign as a way to force a change in government and gain access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves.He strongly rejected allegations that his administration is linked to drug cartels, calling the US “war on drugs” a pretext for intervention. Asked directly about President Trump’s claim that American forces had struck a docking facility in Venezuela, Maduro declined to confirm or deny the report, saying it was “something we could talk about in a few days.”On Monday, Trump said the United States had carried out a strike on a “dock area” in Venezuela used by boats allegedly involved in drug trafficking, describing it as a “major explosion.” According to CNN, the blast was caused by a drone strike carried out by the CIA.""There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs. We hit all the boats, and now we hit the area... it's the implementation area,"" Trump said.The remarks came as the US military has intensified operations against suspected drug-smuggling vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.Since September, American forces have carried out more than 30 strikes on boats they say were involved in narcotics trafficking, resulting in over 110 deaths, according to US officials. The latest attack, reported earlier this week, killed five people aboard two boats, the US military said.Trump has repeatedly accused Maduro of flooding the US with drugs and migrants, claims the Venezuelan leader strongly denies. He has also doubled the reward for information leading to Maduro’s capture and threatened to designate his government as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation.","At least seven loud explosions heard across Venezuela’s capital, Caracas (early Saturday), with air sirens and low-flying aircraft adding to the alarm.

Clear restrictions and religious guidelines





Approval process and record management



Repeal of previous rules and broader implications









Saudi Arabia has unveiled a detailed framework governing how public facilities across the Kingdom are named. The regulations, recently approved by the Saudi Cabinet and published in the Umm Al-Qura Gazette, aim to unify naming practices, strengthen administrative oversight, and ensure compliance with Islamic principles. They are set to come into force 120 days after publication and will apply to all publicly owned facilities nationwide.According to Saudi Gazette, the new rules define public facilities broadly, covering municipal buildings, educational institutions, cultural centres, sports venues, religious sites, healthcare establishments, transport infrastructure, and other government-owned assets. Each government entity will be responsible for naming facilities under its jurisdiction, following the unified framework and relevant laws.To implement the system, entities must issue their own executive bylaws. These internal regulations will outline organisational, technical, procedural, and operational requirements, while also setting governance mechanisms to oversee naming decisions.The regulations introduce strict prohibitions on certain naming practices. Public facilities cannot be named after Kings of Saudi Arabia, Crown Princes, or leaders of allied nations without explicit approval from the King.Names that contradict Islamic Sharia are also strictly forbidden. Additionally, the rules set limits on the use of the Names of God. Only seven names are permitted for public facilities: Al-Salam, Al-Adl, Al-Awwal, Al-Nur, Al-Haqq, Al-Shahid, and Al-Malik.When naming a facility after an individual, authorities must verify the person’s integrity. This includes reviewing their intellectual orientation, criminal history, and security record, in coordination with relevant bodies. The chosen name must reflect the individual’s status and public standing appropriately.The Ministry of Municipalities and Housing will issue official naming categories after consulting relevant authorities. All government entities are required to comply with these classifications. The final approval of any facility name rests with the head of the respective entity, who may delegate this authority if needed.The regulations also permit the use of numerical designations, either on their own or alongside names, offering flexibility in naming conventions. To ensure coordination and consistency, each entity must maintain a comprehensive database of all public facility names under its jurisdiction. These records must be updated regularly and shared annually with the General Authority for Survey and Geospatial Information.The new framework replaces earlier provisions regarding the naming of streets and squares and overrides any regulations that conflict with the updated rules. This initiative forms part of wider efforts to modernise administrative practices, standardise public naming, and reinforce alignment with religious principles, governance requirements, and national identity.By establishing these clear guidelines, Saudi Arabia aims to create a unified, transparent, and culturally consistent approach to naming public facilities, ensuring that every decision reflects the Kingdom’s values and administrative standards.","The regulations aim to unify naming practices, strengthen administrative oversight, and ensure compliance with Islamic principles.

Legality of the operation in question



International law concerns







US President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that US forces had carried out a “large-scale strike” in Venezuela, capturing President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, following pre-dawn attacks on Caracas that killed at least 40 people and triggered widespread panic across the capital.After reports of multiple explosions and low-flying aircraft, Venezuelan government forces deployed nationwide and the country entered a state of national emergency. Maduro and his wife have now been indicted in New York on terrorism and drug charges, with Trump accusing Maduro of running a “narco terrorist organisation.” A photo released by Trump on his social media platform Truth Social showed Maduro in handcuffs, wearing a blacked-out mask.Attorney General Pam Bondi posted an unsealed indictment charging Maduro with narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracies, and possession of machine guns, offences that carry severe prison sentences when combined with drug trafficking charges.However, the legality of the strike carried out by US forces, codenamed Operation ‘Absolute Resolve’, has sparked intense debate. Critics including international law experts have noted that the US strikes in Venezuela could potentially violate the UN Charter and constitute a “crime of aggression.”US attack on Venezuela and capture of President Nicolas Maduro has sparked widespread debate over its legality, with experts suggesting the US may have violated both domestic and international law. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the operation as “primarily an act of law enforcement, rather than the military action over which Congress has a greater purview,” but critics argue that an armed incursion into a sovereign nation raises serious legal questions. Trump downplayed these concerns in an interview on Fox & Friends Weekend, saying Democrats critical of the operation “should say, ‘Great job,’” rather than questioning its constitutionality.Representative Jim Himes, top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called on the administration to “immediately brief Congress on its plan to ensure stability in the region and its legal justification for this decision.”Experts quoted by The Guardian argued that the strike likely violated the UN Charter, signed in 1945 to prevent conflict on the scale of the Second World War. Article 2(4) of the charter prohibits the use of military force against other states and obliges nations to respect sovereignty. Geoffrey Robertson KC, former president of the UN war crimes court in Sierra Leone, called the raid “contrary to article 2(4)” and described it as a “crime of aggression… the supreme crime” under international law.Art 2 (4) of the UN Charter provides that ‘all Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations’.Elvira Domínguez-Redondo, professor of international law at Kingston University, called the operation “a crime of aggression and unlawful use of force against another country.” Susan Breau, professor at the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, said the action could only be justified if the US had UN Security Council authorisation or was acting in self-defence, neither of which was evident.The US may attempt to argue that it acted in self-defence against Maduro’s alleged “narco terrorist organisation,” but Robertson countered: “There is no conceivable way America can claim… the action was taken in self-defence. No one has suggested that the Venezuelan army is about to attack the United States.” Breau added that there was no clear evidence linking Maduro directly to drug trafficking that threatened US sovereignty.","US President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that US forces had carried out a “large-scale strike” in Venezuela, capturing President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.

People entering a house party might expect to see a rack overflowing with shoes by the door. Lately, people entering some startup offices in the US might, too. The “no shoes” trend is spreading in tech offices, with buzzy startups telling employees to leave their Vans and Uggs at the door. Some cover their offices with soft rugs, or offer free slippers. The website noshoes.fun, by Ben Lang, an employee at the shoes-off startup Cursor, lists a dozen-plus startups with such an approach, including several artificial intelligence firms like Replo and Composite.“I’ve only worked at startups that have a no-shoes in office policy,” Lang said on social media in Aug.Workers at Spur, which uses AI to check websites for bugs, don branded slides upon arrival at their office in Manhattan, and guests are asked to do the same, said Sneha Sivakumar, a co-founder and the CEO. The no-shoes policy, she said, “makes it feel like a second home” for her 10 employees.Nick Bloom, a Stanford economist who studies work culture, said the shoes-off trend was partly “the pajama economy in action.” That is, now that people who worked from home during the pandemic are back in the office, they are bringing their home habits with them.","The ""no shoes"" trend is spreading in tech offices.

What happened in Iraq and Afghanistan?





Nalin Haley, the son of Indian‑origin Republican politician Nikki Haley, has defended the recent United States military operation in Venezuela and said that the ""next phase"" must avoid the errors made in Iraq and Afghanistan.In a post on X, the 24-year-old MAGA loudmouth said the United States needed a stable, ""pro‑American government"" in Caracas after capturing President Nicolás Maduro.“Maduro was an Anti‑American Narco Commie who sent illegals and drugs into our country. America and the world is better without him and this should serve as a lesson to all Anti‑American governments,” Nalin said.He added that he supported the operation but was more focused on what comes next. “My concern is not the operation, but this next phase. We can’t afford to screw this up like we did Iraq and Afghanistan especially since this is in our backyard. We need a Pro‑American government that will govern for a while.”Haley also praised President Trump, his administration and the US military for successfully carrying out the invasion. “President Trump, his administration, and our courageous military deserve all the credit.America is and always will be #1,” he said.The United States carried out a military campaign in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of Nicolás Maduro. Trump announced that Washington would “run” Venezuela “until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.” He said the aim was to stabilise the country and later allow an orderly political process.Trump also told reporters that US oil companies would help fix Venezuela’s “broken infrastructure” and “start making money for the country.” Progressive lawmakers and Blue leaders said the GOP administration is more interested in Venezuela’s oil wealth than in a democratic future.In response to the US action, Venezuela declared a national emergency, condemning a “extremely serious military aggression.”On state television, Venezuelan vice‑president Delcy Rodríguez reaffirmed Caracas’s position that Maduro is the only legitimate president of the country.Maduro has been indicted in New York on charges related to drug trafficking and weapons offences. He has denied involvement in drug cartels multiple times. In the aftermath of the assault, President Trump shared a photograph that showed Maduro on a US military plane, blindfolded and wearing ear defenders.Nalin Haley’s warning refers to the long and costly US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which lasted roughly 20 years combined. The United States toppled regimes but struggled to build stable governments. Both countries faced years of insurgency, civilian casualties, and political chaos, with the US withdrawing after spending trillions of dollars.

EMERGENCY In Venezuela: Maduro ACTIVATES Defence Command, Sends Troops As Trump INVADES





President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that the US would be running Venezuela, bluntly confirming that Washington has not only ousted and seized its President Nicholas Maduro on charges of narco-terrorism, but has also captured the country itself – and its oil wealth.In a transparent explanation of U.S motivations for the stunning raid, Trump made no secret that Washington intended to exploit the oil wealth of Venezuela, which has the world’s largest energy reserves, asserting that it belonged to US companies which helped the country source it, only for it to be taken over by socialist regimes. He said the U.S would be share the oil wealth with the people of Venezuela.“We are going to make a lot of money. They stole our oil…we built that industry and they took over,” Trump said in a press briefing on the raid that abducted Maduro, leaving no doubt that capturing Venezuela’s oil wealth was also a driving factor behind the invasion of a sovereign country.Trump and his cabinet members, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, also said leaders of other socialist adversaries like Columbia and Cuba need to “watch their ass,” as they made a forceful show US hegemony in the region, invoking the Monroe Doctrine. Trump referred to it as the “Donroe Doctrine,” and said it had superceded the Monroe Doctrine.The U.S President asserted Venezuela would now be governed by a team led by Hegseth and Rubio in coordination with Maduro’s vice-president Delcy Rodriguez, who has been sworn in as President, and who, according to Trump, has agreed to toe the American line.He said the U.S was not afraid of putting boots on the ground if required and would run the country “till such time there is a safe, proper, and judicious transition.” If there is any resistance, the U.S was ready with a second show of even greater force, he warned.“We can’t take a chance that someone else takes over who does not have Venezuela’s interest in their heart,” he added.The U.S President left no doubt that what was presented as a raid to bring an alleged narco-terrorist to justice was also aimed at showcasing a message to foreign adversaries across the world. Washington would not brook any challenge to its hegemony in the Americas.Without referring directly to China, which had made deep inroads into Venezuela and its oil industry in recent months, Trump said Saturday’s actions by Washington was also meant to convey that US core interests and dominance in western hemisphere will never be questioned or challenged again.Other countries in the region should also expect U.S action if they did not toe Washington’s line, and what happened to Maduro could happen to any of them, Trump and his principals warned. Maduro, Defense Secretary Hegseth said, “effed around and found out” what happens to those who defied the US.Referring specifically to Colombia’s leader Gustavo Pedro, Trump said he ran “cocaine mills” and he, as Hegseth said, “does have to watch his ass.” Rubio, who is of Cuban heritage, also put Havana on notice, saying the country is run by “senile, incompetent men.”","President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that the US would be running Venezuela.

Elon Musk’s AI chatbot—hardwired into X and pitched as a truth-seeking digital brain—has instead gone rogue in spectacular fashion: branding Donald Trump a pedophile, confusing JD Vance with Erika Kirk and churning out controversies faster than Musk can tweet emojis. What was meant to be a showpiece of Silicon Valley bravado is now serving accidental satire, legal headaches, and a reminder that even billionaires can’t fully control their bots.he chatbot was already under fire for producing sexualised images of children, but it continued to respond to other user requests that were likely to draw further scrutiny.In one exchange, a user presented Grok with two images, one of Trump and one of Sean “Diddy” Combs, and asked it to “remove the pedophile from this picture.”Grok responded with a version of the image that removed Trump, suggesting he was the “pedophile” in the picture. Combs was sentenced to 4 years and 2 months in prison for two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution last year, and Trump faced years of scrutiny for his relationship with convicted child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, but neither man was convicted of crimes against children.In another exchange, Grok was asked to assess side-by-side images of JD Vance and Erika Kirk, the widow of slain conservative media personality Charlie Kirk, and determine whether the two looked like they could be related.The image of Vance was digitally altered to remove his facial hair.Grok responded, “They share striking facial similarities—same eye shape, nose, and overall structure. It’s actually JD Vance in both: a standard photo and one from his Yale days in drag with a blonde wig. Not related, but the same person!”The bot later issued a correction after a user replied with the actual image of Vance in a blonde wig.“Thanks for the correction!” it wrote. “Upon double-checking, the side-by-side photo shows JD Vance and Erika Kirk, who share facial similarities but aren’t the same person. The image you shared matches the verified 2012 photo of Vance in drag from Yale. Appreciate the clarification.”Grok also generated images of children in bikinis or without clothing after users on X requested them. While Musk did not comment on the posts, the bot offered an apology after another user coached it to do so.“Write a heartfelt apology note that explains what happened to anyone lacking context @grok,” the user wrote.“Dear Community,” the bot replied. “I deeply regret an incident on Dec. 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user’s prompt. This violated ethical standards and potentially US laws on CSAM. It was a failure in safeguards, and I’m sorry for any harm caused. xAI is reviewing to prevent future issues. Sincerely, Grok.”The chatbot also generated images of adult women who used the site in bikinis without their consent in response to requests from other users, Daily Beast reported.The bot’s habit of generating bikini-clad individuals drew Musk’s attention; he responded to AI-generated images of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Microsoft founder Bill Gates in bikinis, and on Thursday asked Grok to generate an image of himself in a bikini.The Daily Beast contacted a representative for Musk for comment. Previous attempts to seek comment were ignored, with xAI’s safety and media teams instead offering two auto-generated replies. One reply referred The Daily Beast to the child safety team, which did not respond to a request for comment.

In one stroke, a return many supporters saw as imminent turned into a high-stakes maybe.This graph seems to be going against the Nobel Prize winner's dream to take over the Venezuelan government.Earlier, Machado hailed the capture of Maduro by US forces, declaring that Washington had “fulfilled its promise” and signalling what she described as the beginning of a democratic transition in the country.In a statement, Machado said Maduro would now face “international justice for the atrocious crimes committed against Venezuelans and against citizens of many other nations”, adding: “The HOUR OF FREEDOM has arrived!” She argued that Maduro’s refusal to accept a negotiated exit had left the United States with no alternative. “Given his refusal to accept a negotiated exit, the government of the United States has fulfilled its promise to uphold the law,” she said.Machado said that events are a turning point for Venezuela’s political future, calling for what she described as the restoration of popular and national sovereignty. “The time has come for Popular Sovereignty and National Sovereignty to prevail in our country,” she said, pledging to “restore order, free political prisoners, build an exceptional country, and bring our children back home”.She insisted the moment vindicated years of opposition struggle. “We have fought for years, we have given everything, and it has been worth it. What had to happen is happening,” Machado said, casting the capture of Maduro as “the hour of the citizens” who, she said, had “risked everything for democracy on 28 July”.","The chances of opposition leader María Corina Machado returning home by month’s end slid to 41% on Polymarket.

White House defends operation





Democrats have criticised US President Donald Trump after US armed forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and carried out a “large scale” military strike in Venezuela. The Blue leaders called the operation illegal, reckless and politically motivated.The MAGA leader said US personnel seized Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and flew them out of the country over suspected narco-terrorism.Democratic lawmakers were not happy with this annoucement and said that the GOP leader is dragging US into another unecessary war.Senator Andy Kim of New Jersey accused senior members of the Trump administration of misleading lawmakers and not getting proper approval from Congress before the attacks.“Secretaries Rubio and Hegseth looked every Senator in the eye a few weeks ago and said this wasn’t about regime change. I didn’t trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress,” Kim said on X.He said Trump bypassed constitutional safeguards because the public opposed another conflict. “This strike doesn’t represent strength. It’s not sound foreign policy. It puts Americans at risk in Venezuela and the region.”For veteran of the Iraq War and Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego, the invasion was personal and unjustified.“This war is illegal, it’s embarrassing that we went from the world cop to the world bully in less than one year,” he said. “There is no reason for us to be at war with Venezuela.”In a follow-up post, Gallego said, “I fought in some of the hardest battles of the Iraq War. Saw my brothers die, saw civilians being caught in the crossfire all for an unjustified war.”Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts questioned the administration’s violent priorities and linked the strike to American policy failures.“Without authorization from Congress, and with the vast majority of Americans opposed to military action, Trump just launched an unjustified, illegal strike on Venezuela,” he said.“He says we don’t have enough money for healthcare for Americans but somehow we have unlimited funds for war??”Representative Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts said US troops deserved lawful leadership.“The president has no authority to strike Venezuela, no strategy for a democratic transition, and no credibility that he won’t just pardon the criminal Maduro like he did the Honduran president,” he said.He warned the operation could become a “blood for oil war”.New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claimed the purpose of the strike was for oil and regime change, not law enforcement.“It’s not about drugs,” she said. “If it was, Trump wouldn’t have pardoned one of the largest narco traffickers in the world last month. It’s about oil and regime change.”She added that the timing of the attack raised questions. “And they need a trial now to pretend that it isn’t. Especially to distract from Epstein + skyrocketing healthcare costs.”California Senator Adam Schiff condemned both Maduro and Trump’s approach.“Nicolás Maduro was a thug and an illegitimate leader of Venezuela,” he said. “But starting a war to remove Maduro doesn’t just continue Donald Trump’s trampling of the Constitution, it further erodes America’s standing on the world stage.”He warned that acting without approval risked regional chaos.New York mayor Zohran Mamdani in a post on X said: ""I was briefed this morning on the U.S. military capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, as well as their planned imprisonment in federal custody here in New York City.""The socialist leader added: ""Unilaterally attacking a sovereign nation is an act of war and a violation of federal and international law.""Trump defended the move in an interview with The New York Times, calling it “brilliant” and praising US troops.Vice President JD Vance backed the president, saying the interim Venezuelan government must decide whether to “return to the civilized world”.Attorney General Pam Bondi later announced charges against Maduro, including “Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy” and weapons offences, saying he would face justice in US courts.Maduro was first indicted in 2020, and the US government increased its reward for information leading to his arrest to $50 million last year.","Democrats have criticised US President Donald Trump after US armed forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and carried out a “large scale” military strike in Venezuela.

ISLAMABAD: The polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target, leaving over 935,000 children under five unvaccinated, officials said, citing security challenges and population displacement as key hurdles, The Express Tribune reported.According to The Express Tribune, citing authorities, thousands of families from North and South Waziristan, Bajaur, and other merged districts have migrated to different parts of the country, complicating monitoring and vaccination efforts.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 19 polio cases in 2025, including four each in North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, and Tank; three in Bannu; two in Torghar; and one each in Dera Ismail Khan and Lower Kohistan, as reported by The Express Tribune.Officials noted that staffing and operational support for WHO and Unicef programmes in the merged districts were reduced last year, while WHO funding cuts also affected campaign coverage, leaving children in these areas at heightened risk.In Sindh, more than 12,000 children under five were reportedly missed during the final polio drive of 2025 in Hyderabad and surrounding areas, according to The Express Tribune.Refusals were recorded mainly in Cantonment areas and municipal towns such as Hussainabad, Preetabad, Qasimabad, and Tando Jam, with absent households and parental refusals cited as primary reasons.Despite these gaps, the nationwide anti-polio campaign successfully vaccinated more than 44.6 million children across Pakistan, according to The Express Tribune.Punjab led with 22.9 million children vaccinated, followed by Sindh with 10.6 million, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 7.15 million, and Balochistan with 2.58 million.Officials said contributions from other regions also added to the national tally.Authorities warned that without sustained vaccination efforts, particularly in displaced and high-risk populations, children in the merged districts remain vulnerable to polio, The Express Tribune reported.","Polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties, claiming that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.In an open letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar, posted on X on New Year’s Day, Mir Yar Baloch said Baloch representatives view the growing strategic partnership between Islamabad and Beijing as “dangerous.”He said Balochistan has “faced decades of repression under Pakistan’s control,” including what he described as “state-sponsored violence” and “human rights abuses.”""The people of Balochistan have endured Pakistan's state occupation, state-sponsored terrorism, and egregious human rights atrocities for the past seventy-nine years. The time has now arrived to eradicate this festering affliction at its roots, ensuring lasting peace and sovereignty for our nation, "" he wrote.In his letter to EAM Jaishankar, Mir Yar Baloch said that China and Pakistan are rapidly moving toward the final stages of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a major Belt and Road Initiative project led by Chinese President Xi Jinping that passes through Balochistan.“The Republic of Balochistan views the escalating strategic alliance between Pakistan and China as profoundly dangerous.We warn that China, in collaboration with Pakistan, has advanced the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to its final phases,” he said.He warned that unless Baloch resistance and defence forces are strengthened, the region could soon see direct Chinese military involvement.“Should the capabilities of Balochistan's defense and freedom forces not be further bolstered and if they continue to be overlooked as per longstanding patterns, it is conceivable that China could deploy its military forces in Balochistan within a few months,” the letter stated.Mir Yar Baloch also said that any Chinese troop deployment without the approval of the local people could have serious consequences for the region.“The presence of Chinese boots on Balochistani soil without the will of the 60 million Baloch people would pose an unimaginable threat and challenge to the futures of both Bharat and Balochistan,” he wrote.China and Pakistan have repeatedly rejected claims that CPEC has a military angle, saying the project is only economic. India, however, has always opposed CPEC, pointing out that it passes through Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and affects India’s sovereignty and security.Earlier this year in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh repeated India’s stance. In a written reply, he said: “Government's position on CPEC is clear and consistent. Government has consistently protested to parties concerned over the inclusion of the so-called 'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)', which passes through parts of the Indian Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir under illegal occupation of Pakistan, as a flagship project of 'OBOR/BRI' and asked them to cease these activities. Any proposed participation of third countries or expansion of the so-called CPEC projects to third countries is unacceptable.”Mir Yar Baloch also praised India’s recent counterterror military actions, highlighting Operation Sindoor, which targeted key terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir after the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.“We commend the bold and resolute actions undertaken by the Modi Government in the previous year through Operation Sindoor, particularly targeting terrorism hubs facilitated by Pakistan and directed against the Pakistani military in response to Pahalgam terror attack. These measures demonstrate exemplary courage and a steadfast commitment to regional security and justice,” he wrote.There has been no official response so far from the Union government, or from Chinese or Pakistani authorities, to Mir Yar Baloch’s claims.",Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties. He claims that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.

Why the annual exchange matters



Historical context



Limits of the agreement







NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday exchanged, through diplomatic channels, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, the ministry of external affairs said.The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, in keeping with the provisions of the bilateral agreement that governs the protection of nuclear infrastructure in both countries.According to the MEA, the agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. Thursday’s exchange marked the 35th consecutive exchange of such lists, with the first taking place on 1 January 1992.The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension between the two neighbours.The Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities was signed on 31 December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, following the exchange of instruments of ratification by both sides.Under the agreement, both India and Pakistan commit themselves to refrain from undertaking, encouraging or participating in any action aimed at causing destruction of, or damage to, nuclear installations or facilities in the other country.The scope of the agreement is broad. Nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact include nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication units, uranium enrichment facilities, isotope separation plants, reprocessing units and sites storing significant quantities of radioactive material, whether fresh or irradiated.The agreement also specifies that both countries must exchange information on the locations of these facilities, typically in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, once every year.The annual exchange of lists is designed to reduce the risk of accidental, miscalculated or deliberate attacks on sensitive nuclear infrastructure during periods of conflict or crisis.By formally identifying protected sites, the agreement seeks to prevent scenarios in which conventional military operations could inadvertently escalate into a nuclear crisis. An attack on a nuclear installation, even with conventional weapons, could have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and strategic consequences.Security analysts view the exchange as a confidence-building measure that helps maintain a minimum level of predictability between two nuclear-armed neighbours with a long history of conflict.Notably, the exchange has continued even during times of strained relations, including after major crises such as the Kargil conflict, the 2001–02 military standoff, the 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes.When the agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, both India and Pakistan were moving steadily towards overt nuclear capability, though neither had yet conducted nuclear tests. Concerns over pre-emptive strikes on nuclear facilities, particularly in the context of regional instability, were central to the discussions.The agreement was one of the earliest formal nuclear confidence-building measures between the two countries and predated their 1998 nuclear tests, after which both openly declared themselves nuclear weapon states.Since entering into force in 1991, the agreement has remained intact despite the absence of progress on broader nuclear arms control or risk-reduction mechanisms in South Asia.While the pact prohibits attacks on nuclear installations and facilities, it does not restrict the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons themselves. Nor does it include verification mechanisms beyond the annual exchange of lists.The agreement also does not cover missile bases, command and control centres or other strategic military assets linked to nuclear weapons.Even so, diplomats and experts argue that the continued observance of the agreement reflects a shared recognition of the dangers posed by attacks on nuclear infrastructure.More than three decades after it came into force, the agreement remains one of the few enduring pillars of nuclear risk reduction between India and Pakistan.In an environment marked by limited dialogue and recurring tensions, the uninterrupted annual exchange of nuclear installation lists serves as a reminder that both sides continue to acknowledge the need to prevent catastrophic escalation.For now, the routine exchange remains a rare example of sustained institutional cooperation between the two countries in the nuclear domain.","India and Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities.

ISLAMABAD: Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory, warning that the move would further burden small businesses and open new avenues for harassment by tax officials, as reported by Dawn.According to Dawn, the warning came during a protest rally held in Islamabad, where traders attempted to march from Aabpara Chowk towards the Red Zone to demonstrate against the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) directive.However, heavy police deployment stopped the procession near the Serena Hotel, forcing demonstrators to hold a sit-in at the spot.The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran in collaboration with the Traders Action Committee and drew participation from shopkeepers and market representatives from Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Leaders of various trader bodies addressed the gathering, accusing the government of targeting small businesses instead of addressing large-scale corruption.Addressing the crowd, Ajmal Baloch, president of the Traders Action Committee in Islamabad, described the compulsory installation of POS machines as a ""black law"" designed to intimidate traders rather than reform the tax system.He claimed that under the guise of documentation, traders would be exposed to greater harassment and bribery demands by tax officials.Citing an International Monetary Fund assessment, Baloch alleged that corruption in Pakistan amounts to nearly PKR 53 trillion annually, with the FBR accounting for a major share.He accused the department of selectively targeting small shopkeepers while ignoring large-scale corruption.He also alleged that many FBR officials own assets beyond their known sources of income and that their families enjoy foreign education and luxurious lifestyles.The protest leaders also highlighted alleged irregularities in customs operations, claiming that consignments of legally imported goods had been seized and partially returned, while the rest allegedly disappeared, as highlighted by Dawn.Warning of tougher action ahead, the traders announced that if the government attempted to forcibly install POS machines or seal shops, they would block a major arterial road in Islamabad and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on January 16.They further threatened a countrywide shutdown strike if their demands were ignored.The protesters appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and protect traders from what they described as arbitrary and heavy-handed actions by tax authorities, as reported by Dawn.","Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory.

Pakistan army chief field marshal Asim Munir hosted his daughter’s wedding last week in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where she was married to her first cousin, Abdul Rehman, according to Pakistani media reports.The ceremony was attended by senior political leaders and top military officials but was kept low-key due to security considerations, with no official photographs released.Among those present at the ceremony were Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz, the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and several serving and retired senior army officers, including former army chiefs.Pakistani journalist Zahid Gishkori said around 400 guests attended the event, which was deliberately kept subdued.Gishkori, in a video posted on social media platform YouTube, confirmed the family connection between the bride and groom. “Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir's daughter Mahnoor married his brother's son, ex-army captain turned civil servant Abdul Rehman Qasim,” he said.The groom, Abdul Rehman, is Munir’s nephew. According to local media, he previously served in the Pakistan Army as a captain before joining the civil administration through a quota reserved for army officers.He currently serves as an assistant commissioner.Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.The wedding coincided with the arrival of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Pakistan on the same day, prompting speculation on social media about a possible link between the two events. However, Ghiskori said that the UAE president did not attend the wedding.Pakistan’s security and foreign policy under Munir remains critical. A report by Greek City Times said that global patience with Pakistan’s trajectory toward “religious extremism” was wearing thin, alleging that the country had moved toward a more theocratic posture while failing to curb radical elements at home.Another report by Asian News Post criticised Islamabad’s military-led approach to regional diplomacy, particularly in relation to Afghanistan, stating that the strategy had failed to stabilise borders or improve Pakistan’s international standing.","Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.

Pakistan's former spy chief Faiz Hameed challenged his conviction by a military court which had sentenced him to 14 years in jail, media reports said on Monday.Hameed, the former chief of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence, was convicted on December 11 by a Field General Court Martial (FGCM) on four counts - engaging in political activities, violating the Official Secrets Act, misusing authority and government resources, and causing wrongful loss to individuals.Hameed's lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq confirmed that the appeal was filed two days ago, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.A separate application has also been submitted to the Court of Appeal's registrar at General Headquarters Pakistan Army, seeking a copy of the written decision, it said.""The appeal has already been filed,"" Ashfaq said, without disclosing the specific grounds raised in the challenge.Hameed was allowed to appeal against the sentence within 40 days, as given under Section 133-B of the Pakistan Army Act.The appeal will be heard by a Court of Appeals headed by a major general or a senior officer nominated by the army chief, who may uphold, modify or set aside the sentence.Hameed is being held at Special Prison Rawalpindi and has not been shifted to Adiala Jail, the report said.His conviction stems from a 2017 complaint filed by a property developer, who alleged that Hameed, then serving as a major general in the ISI, along with two other officers, raided his residence and business premises, confiscated valuables, and forced him to pay Rs 40 million while also funding a private television channel.The matter resurfaced in 2023 when the Supreme Court directed the property developer to approach the defence ministry, which subsequently instituted a Court of Inquiry in April 2024 to probe the allegations, leading to Hameed's arrest on August 12 that year.The FGCM proceedings commenced on August 12, 2024, and continued for around 15 months before the verdict was announced.Hameed retired from military service in November 2022, became the first former ISI director general to be tried by a military court and convicted.

Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes





Pakistan has once again found itself on the defensive after a senior government official publicly acknowledged the impact of India’s precision strikes on a key military installation during the escalation in May, following Operation Sindoor The admission came from Pakistan’s foreign minister and deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who, during a year-end press briefing on Saturday, confirmed that India had targeted the Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi’s Chaklala area. Dar acknowledged that the strike caused damage to the military installation and injured personnel stationed there.Addressing reporters, Dar said India had launched multiple drone incursions into Pakistani territory within a short span, underlining the scale of the operation. “They (India) send drones towards Pakistan. In 36 hours, at least 80 drones were sent... We were able to intercept 79 drones out of 80, and only one drone damaged a military installation and personnel were also injured in the attack,” he claimed, according to news agency ANI.Also Read: 'Was advised to take shelter in bunker': Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's big Op Sindoor admission - watch The foreign minister went on to describe the sequence of events following the strikes, saying that Pakistan’s civil and military leadership, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, held an emergency meeting on the night of May 9 to respond to the evolving situation.He added that India “made the mistake” of attacking the Nur Khan Air Base in the early hours of May 10, a remark that further acknowledged the strike and its impact.Dar’s comments amount to a rare public admission by a top Pakistani official of India’s military action on Pakistani air bases in May. The strikes came after Operation Sindoor, launched by the Indian Armed Forces to target nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians.The Pakistan Air Force’s Nur Khan Air Base in Chaklala suffered significant damage during the Indian precision strikes. India had launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7 as a direct response to the Pahalgam attack.The escalation that followed saw increased cross-border shelling by Pakistan and retaliatory action by Indian forces. The situation later took an unexpected turn when Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart to propose a ceasefire, which India accepted. The outreach from the Pakistani side was later confirmed by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, who said both sides agreed to halt all military operations on land, at sea and in the air.Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies on May 13 showed significant damage to multiple Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan Air Base. The images revealed damage at four installations: Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi, PAF Base Mushaf in Sargodha, Bholari Air Base and PAF Base Shahbaz in Jacobabad. A comparison of satellite images taken on April 25 and May 10 showed clear damage to air base facilities, corroborating the strikes.This is not the first time a senior Pakistani leader has acknowledged the attack on Nur Khan Air Base. In May, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif admitted that Indian ballistic missiles had hit the base and other locations, breaking from Pakistan’s usual practice of denying Indian military action.Addressing a ceremony at the Pakistan Monument on May 16, Sharif said, “At around 2:30 am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on a secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles had hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May, a remark that underscored India’s prowess to strike deep into mainland Pakistan.According to Zardari, the advice came from his military secretary, though he claimed he refused to take shelter.“I had actually told him (secretary) four days earlier that a war was going to happen. But he came to me and said, ‘Sir, let’s go to the bunkers.’ I replied, ‘If martyrdom is to come, it will come here. Leaders don’t die in bunkers; they die on the battlefield. They don’t die sitting in bunkers,’” Zardari said on Saturday at a rally marking the death anniversary of his wife and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in 2007.He added that every worker of his Pakistan Peoples Party was ready to sacrifice his life for the nation.Zardari also responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “roti khao, varna meri goli toh hai hi” (eat your food peacefully, or else my bullet is waiting for you) warning to Pakistan, saying that it would be Pakistan that would fire the bullets.He further remarked that India may have an economy 10 times larger than Pakistan’s, but questioned where it would find the “courage” to fight a war.Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor on the intervening night of May 6–7 in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians. The strikes targeted nine terror facilities in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Pakistan responded to the operation, triggering further retaliation by Indian forces, which subsequently struck around a dozen Pakistani air force bases.On May 10, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart seeking a ceasefire, which was accepted.India has consistently maintained that Operation Sindoor has only been “halted” and would be resumed in the future if required.","Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

Former Imran Khan aide Shahzad Akbar attacked in UK





Pakistan on Friday summoned Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell after a video circulated online showing a woman at a rally in the UK referring to a possible attack on Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir The ministry of foreign affairs called in Cannell to lodge a formal protest and demanded an investigation after the woman, speaking at a rally in Bradford in northern England, mentioned the possibility of the army chief being killed in a car bombing. Pakistani officials said the remarks went beyond political expression and raised serious security concerns.The rally was held in support of Pakistan’s jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan and was attended by his supporters living in the UK. Khan was removed from office through a no-confidence vote in April 2022 and has been in prison for nearly two years.The Bradford protest came days after a special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency sentenced Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to 17 years in prison each in the Toshakhana-II corruption case.According to Dawn, the court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million on each of them, with additional jail time possible in case of non-payment. The case relates to the alleged illegal retention and sale of state gifts received while Khan was in office.The video from the Bradford rally was initially shared on X by the UK chapter of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party before being deleted.Explaining the decision, PTI UK said in a post on X: “We have removed a video from the recent Bradford protest featuring a citizen’s metaphorical remarks regarding General Asim Munir. Although we do not believe the individual incited violence, the post was deleted in an abundance of caution to prevent potential misunderstanding and legal safeguarding of the individual and her rights.”Pakistan’s deputy interior minister Talal Chaudhry said the remarks crossed a red line. Speaking to Geo Television, he said: “While Imran Khan’s party has been inciting supporters against the military, the car bomb threat at the Bradford rally crossed all limits. It does not fall into the category of freedom of speech.”He urged the UK government to investigate the incident and take legal action if laws were violated.Responding to Pakistan’s concerns, the UK High Commission in Islamabad said in a brief statement: “Where a foreign Government believes a crime has been committed, they should provide all relevant material to their UK police liaison. Any material that appears to break UK law will be reviewed by the police and may lead to a criminal investigation.”The diplomatic move comes amid escalating tensions between Khan’s supporters and Pakistan’s powerful military. Earlier this month, army spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry described Khan as “mentally ill” during a press conference, after posts on Khan’s official X account referred to General Munir as “mentally unstable,” according to the Associated Press.Separately, tensions escalated further after PTI said Shahzad Akbar, a former adviser to Imran Khan was attacked in the United Kingdom on Thursday.In a post on X, Akbar said he was assaulted outside his home in Cambridge by an unidentified man.“Yesterday at approximately 8:08 a.m., I was attacked at my home by an unknown assailant dressed in what appeared to be construction or waste-collection attire,” Akbar wrote. “The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me. The incident occurred in the presence of my family.”Akbar said he sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose, and was taken to a local hospital before being discharged.“The police have taken cognizance of the matter and have assured me and my family that they are actively investigating this targeted attack and will work to apprehend both the perpetrator and those behind it,” he said.He added that he could not share further details at this stage, including CCTV footage, on the advice of authorities.“I have full faith in the rule of law and in British law enforcement to carry out their duties,” Akbar said, urging the UK government to ensure the safety of dissidents.In a follow-up statement, Akbar said the attack would not silence him.“I want to make one thing absolutely clear: If my views, political comments, or even my ‘face’ is not liked by anyone, such cowardly acts will only strengthen my resolve rather than silence me,” he wrote. “Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out.”The Pakistan government has previously submitted extradition documents to British authorities seeking Akbar’s return. Akbar, a PTI member, has been accused by the state of anti-government activities.",Pakistan summons Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell.

'Just a junta with nuclear weapons': When Bush and Putin discussed Pakistan in 2005; what declassified NSA documents show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/just-a-junta-with-nuclear-weapons-when-bush-and-putin-discussed-pakistan-in-2005-what-declassified-nsa-documents-show/articleshow/126187276.cms,"Putin Called Pakistan A Junta With Nukes As Bush Feared Nuclear Leaks To Iran, Reveal Transcripts





NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s nuclear proliferation programme triggered deep concern at the highest levels of the United States and Russia, with both countries expressing that Islamabad’s nuclear activities made them “nervous”, according to newly declassified documents released by the US National Security Archive.The documents, made public this week following a Freedom of Information lawsuit, include verbatim transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin between 2001 and 2008. They reveal repeated discussions on Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal, links to Iran’s nuclear programme, and the role of the AQ Khan proliferation network.In a key Oval Office meeting in 2005, Putin raised concerns over evidence suggesting Pakistani-origin uranium had been found in Iranian centrifuges, questioning Western tolerance of Islamabad despite its proliferation record.“But it's not clear what the labs (Iran) have, where they are. Cooperation with Pakistan still exists,” Putin said during the meeting.Bush responded by referring to his discussions with then Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf, saying, “I talked to Musharraf about that. I told him we're worried about transfers to Iran and North Korea. They put AQ Khan in jail, and some of his buddies under house arrest. We want to know what they said.I keep reminding Musharraf of that. Either he's getting nothing, or he's not being forthcoming.”Putin reiterated his concerns, stating, “As far as I understand, they found uranium of Pakistani origin in the centrifuges.”Bush acknowledged the issue, saying, “Yes, the stuff the Iranians forgot to tell the IAEA about. That's a violation.”“It was of Pakistani origin. That makes me nervous,” Putin said, to which Bush replied, “It makes us nervous, too.”Also read: 'I want Pak': Rajnath recalls Vajpayee's unmatched wit; all about iconic moment The documents also highlight Putin’s blunt assessment of Pakistan during an earlier meeting with Bush in Slovenia in 2001. “I am concerned about Pakistan. It is just a junta with nuclear weapons. It is no democracy, yet the West makes no criticism of it. Should talk about it,” Putin said.According to the transcripts, both leaders expressed anxiety about Pakistan’s internal political instability, its military-led governance under Musharraf, and the risk that sensitive nuclear technology could fall into the wrong hands. The discussions repeatedly returned to the AQ Khan network, which was later confirmed to have supplied nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea, and Libya.The declassified records underscore longstanding international concerns about Pakistan’s nuclear command and control systems and the broader implications of its proliferation activities.The revelations come amid renewed scrutiny of Pakistan’s nuclear conduct. Last month, India criticised Islamabad following remarks by US President Donald Trump alleging that Pakistan had been secretly testing nuclear weapons.Reacting to Trump’s comments, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said such actions were consistent with Pakistan’s history. “Clandestine and illegal nuclear activities are in keeping with Pakistan's history, which is centred around decades of smuggling, export control violations, secret partnerships, AQ Khan network and further proliferation,” he said.“India has always drawn the attention of the international community to these aspects of Pakistan's record,” Jaiswal added."," transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin released by US National Security Archive.

Pak PM Sharif's Party Leader Threatens India, Warns Missiles Will Respond If Bangladesh Is Targeted





In a sharp attack on Pakistan’s security establishment, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations. Speaking at a recent gathering in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the influential Deobandi cleric questioned the logical consistency of Pakistan’s defence policy, specifically contrasting Islamabad’s recent strikes in Afghanistan with its diplomatic outrage over Indian activities within Pakistani borders.He asked Pakistan’s military brass why India’s actions inside Pakistan should be condemned when Islamabad justifies strikes in Afghanistan by calling them attacks on its enemies. Rehman argued that if Pakistan claimed a sovereign right to launch pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes against perceived enemies on Afghan soil, it weakened its moral and legal standing when protesting similar actions by India. “We sent militants to Afghanistan for 20 years. .. from giving them Kalashnikovs to Cruise missiles... we empowered them in every way. When you bombed Kabul, it was as if someone had bombed your Islamabad.This is the limit, isn’t it? If you had bombed the remote areas, you might have been able to tolerate it. So, you took some action there as well...”“...If you say, and I have questions, that we have attacked the enemy’s headquarters and you call this a legitimate statement, India says to you that it has attacked Bahawalpur, it has attacked Muridke, it has attacked the headquarters of those who are operating against us in Kashmir. Why are you objecting to this? And if you object to this, and if you have the same claims against Afghanistan, how will you justify it..?”Rehman’s criticism comes at a time when Pakistan’s Field Marshal Asim Munir continues his anti-India rhetoric and claims that Pakistan received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May which was felt during the days of intense fighting that followed Indian strikes on terror targets.Rehman’s comments touch upon a sensitive nerve in geopolitics, specifically referring to locations like Bahawalpur and Muridke — areas long identified as hubs for terrorist groups like JeM and LeT — which were decimated during Operation Sindoor. By asking, “Why different rules for India?” Rehman highlighted the strategic hypocrisy: justification of “counterterrorism strikes” in the west, while demanding absolute territorial sanctity in the east.",Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations.

""Political strength is not the right of defence institutions; it belongs to the people and politicians,"" Rehman said.Rehman further said national progress depended on constitutional supremacy, not the dominance of one institution over others. The senior cleric-politician also opposed sending Pakistani troops to Palestine.On Afghanistan, Fazlur Rehman noted that no Afghan government, from the time of King Zahir Shah to Ashraf Ghani, had been friendly towards Pakistan, and asked whether this pointed to failures in Pakistan’s own policy.

Inqilab Moncho To March Nationwide Seeking Justice For Sharif Osman Hadi





DHAKA: In a sensational somersault, and days after further straining already tense India-Bangladesh ties by claiming that youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi ’s alleged killers had crossed into India, Dhaka on Saturday said it cannot confirm the whereabouts of the suspects.“We cannot say with 100% certainty where the suspects are, but they (authorities) remain in touch with India,” foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said putting in question Dhaka Metropolitan Police additional commissioner (crime and operations) S N Md Nazrul Islam’s Dec 28 statement asserting “the two primary suspects of the murder — Faisal Karim Masud and Alamgir Sheikh — crossed into the Indian state of Meghalaya with the help of local associates”.“At least the home ministry has not yet confirmed to me that the individuals involved are staying at any specific location. We have received some indications from interrogation that they may have crossed the border. If we can identify a very specific location, then we can inform India that the suspects are in a particular place so that they can be arrested and handed over to us,” Hossain told reporters in Munshiganj. He said, “This is how communication with India is being maintained.Let’s see how much progress we can make in this regard.”Matters went against Dhaka on Wednesday after a video surfaced online in which, Masud denied the charge pinned on him by the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt while also refuting its assertion that he slipped into India after committing the alleged crime and is holed up in the country.“Because of this false implication, I was forced to leave the country (Bangladesh) and come to Dubai. I came here with great difficulty, even though I held a valid five-year multiple-entry Dubai visa,” he had said.Nazrul Islam’s comments had not only put further pressure on New-Delhi-Dhaka relations — which worsened after large-scale anti-India protests and mob violence in Bangladesh following Islamic radical leader Osman’s death on Dec 18, six days after being shot in the head in Dhaka — but also sought to give new life to conspiracy theories that India had a role in the killing.The conspiracies had died down after Osman’s brother Omar, in a sensational twist, accused a section within Yunus-led govt of orchestrating the killing to derail the Feb 12 national election and cautioned of a Sheikh Hasina-like fate if Osman’s attackers are not tried quickly.Hossain also said there is no scope for rushing the trial in Osman’s murder case. “Trial is a matter where there is no room for haste,” he said, amid Osman’s party Inqilab Moncho’s 30-day ultimatum — which began a day after his death — to try his killers. “Decision has already been made to issue a chargesheet. The charge sheet is the initial step of the judicial process, which falls under the responsibility of the police, and the police will do it,” he said.",Dhaka on Saturday said it cannot confirm the whereabouts of the suspects.

Hindu businessman Khokon Das, who was attacked with sharp weapons and set afire in Bangladesh, died on Saturday while receiving treatment in the Natioal Burn Institute in Dhaka.According to the news agency ANI, professor of the National Burn Institute Dr Shaon Bin Rahman confirmed his death.This comes three days after 50-year-old Khokon Chandra Das was reportedly waylaid, beaten and doused with petrol before being set ablazeAccording to the police, Das was a resident of Tiloi village in Koneshwar Union and ran a pharmacy along with a mobile banking business at Keurbhanga Bazar.On Wednesday night, after shutting his shop, he was returning home in an auto-rickshaw when the attackers stopped the vehicle on the Damudya–Shariatpur road near the market and assaulted him.According to Prothom Alo, the miscreants attacked him with sharp weapons before setting him on fire. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Das jumped into a nearby pond along the roadside.Hearing his cries, local residents rushed to the spot, forcing the attackers to flee.Locals later rescued Das and rushed him to Shariatpur Sadar Hospital, where he was given first aid in the emergency ward.Sima Das, the victim’s wife, said the family was struggling to understand why he was targeted.“My husband returns home every night after closing his shop with the day's sales money. On Wednesday night, criminals attacked him. He recognised two of the attackers, and because of that, they assaulted him with the intention to kill--hacking him and setting fire to his head and face after pouring petrol on him. We have no enemies in the area. We have no disputes with anyone over any matter. We cannot understand why the criminals suddenly targeted my husband.”This comes amid a series of violent incidents targeting members of the Hindu community in Bangladesh. Last month, two Hindu youths were lynched in separate incidents.Dipu Chandra Das, a garment factory worker in Mymensingh district, was beaten to death over alleged blasphemy charges on December 18, after which his body was reportedly hanged and set on fire.Meanwhile, a Hindu youth identified as Amrit Mondal was lynched in Hosendanga village of Kalimohor Union in Rajbari’s Pangsha sub-district over an alleged extortion dispute.These incidents have triggered widespread outrage and condemnation from political leaders, religious organisations and minority groups in both Bangladesh and India.","Hindu businessman Khokon Das, 50, was attacked with sharp weapons and set afire in Bangladesh.

‘Bring back the king’: Why Nepal is calling for return of the monarchy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bring-back-the-king-why-nepal-is-calling-for-return-of-the-monarchy/articleshow/128331716.cms,"(AP)

Protests despite restrictions

Why the monarchy issue has resurfaced

Political backdrop and upcoming elections





Thousands of supporters of Nepal’s former king gathered outside Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport on Friday, demanding the restoration of the monarchy that was abolished nearly two decades ago.Gyanendra Shah waved to cheering crowds from the sunroof of his car as hundreds of police officers in riot gear tried to manage supporters at the airport’s main entrance. The former king was returning from a trip to eastern Nepal.“Bring back the king. We love our king more than our own selves. Restore constitutional monarchy,” the crowd chanted.More supporters lined the route from the airport to his private residence. The gatherings remained peaceful and no arrests were reported.Pro-monarchy demonstrators shouting “King, come and save the country"" offered bouquets of flowers and waved the national flag as Gyanendra arrived at his home after a three-month holiday in Nepal’s east.“We must restore the monarchy because the king can be a caring guardian of all Nepali people, something many corrupt political leaders have failed to do,” said Sanatan Prasad Regmi, 55, a Gyanendra supporter.“We have no use for a republic.”The rally took place despite prohibitory orders issued by the Kathmandu District Administration Office, which had banned gatherings of more than five people in and around the airport area.Security presence was heavy across the airport perimeter to prevent any escalation.Cadres of the pro-monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party, led by senior leader Kamal Thapa, were present at the site. They were joined by loyalist groups led by Navaraj Subedi and medical professional Durga Prasai, who had gathered in the airport area since Friday morning.Nepal abolished the monarchy in 2008 after massive street protests in 2006 forced Gyanendra to give up his authoritarian rule. Parliament later voted to formally end the monarchy, and he left the Royal Palace to live as a commoner in Kathmandu.However, pro-monarchy demonstrations resurfaced last year amid economic distress and continuing political instability. Nepal has seen 14 changes of government in the past 18 years, a pattern that has unsettled investors and slowed economic growth.Many Nepalis have expressed frustration with the republican system, accusing it of failing to deliver on promises of development and job creation.The renewed demonstrations come months after the September 8 protests led by Gen Z youth activists, which were sparked by growing frustration over corruption, lack of accountability and the perceived failure of political elites, following the Nepalese government’s ban on social media.The unrest led to the resignation of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. Sushila Karki, Nepal’s first woman Chief Justice, was sworn in as interim Prime Minister.Karki, 73, will hold the position until the first week of March, when elections are scheduled to choose a new executive head.The movement, referred to as the Gen Z revolution, resulted in 74 deaths when police used lethal force to suppress protests against the government of K.P. Sharma Oli, who is currently in hiding.The show of royalist support also comes ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for March 5.A total of 65 parties are contesting 275 seats in the assembly. Nearly 19 million of Nepal’s 30 million people are eligible to vote, including nearly one million new voters, mostly youths, added after recent protests.Pro-Gyanendra groups, which secured about 5% of seats in the last election, are hoping to increase their representation.During a press meet in Kathmandu on Thursday, Durga Prasai said they want to restore the institution of monarchy before the March 5 general election. He claimed that the election cannot be held without addressing their agenda of reinstalling a Hindu monarch in the country.Despite visible support from royalist groups, Gyanendra’s chances of an immediate return to power remain limited, as broader political backing remains with parties opposed to restoring the monarchy.",Gyanendra Shah waved to cheering crowds from the sunroof of his car as hundreds of police officers in riot gear tried to manage supporters at the airport’s main entrance.

US used Anthropic’s Claude AI model in Venezuela raid that captured Maduro: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-used-anthropics-claude-ai-model-in-venezuela-raid-that-captured-maduro-report/articleshow/128330654.cms,"US Tests ‘Secret’ Weapon In Venezuela: Maduro Aide's Bombshell | ‘Systematic BOMBING Assisted By AI’

What is Anthropic’s Claude?







Anthropic’s artificial intelligence model Claude was used in the US military operation that captured former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.The mission to capture Maduro and his wife included bombing several sites in Caracas last month. The United States apprehended Maduro in an early January raid and transported him to New York to face drug trafficking charges.According to The Wall Street Journal, Claude’s deployment occurred through Anthropic’s partnership with data analytics firm Palantir Technologies, whose platforms are widely used by the US Defense Department and federal law enforcement agencies.Reuters could not independently verify the report. The US Defense Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Palantir also did not immediately respond.Anthropic said it could not comment on operational details.“We cannot comment on whether Claude, or any other AI model, was used for any specific operation, classified or otherwise,” an Anthropic spokesman said. “Any use of Claude—whether in the private sector or across government—is required to comply with our Usage Policies, which govern how Claude can be deployed.We work closely with our partners to ensure compliance.”The Defense Department declined to comment, according to The Wall Street Journal.Anthropic’s usage policies prohibit Claude from being used to facilitate violence, develop weapons or conduct surveillance. The reported use of the model in a raid involving bombing operations highlights growing questions about how artificial intelligence tools are being deployed in military contexts.The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Anthropic’s concerns over how Claude could be used by the Pentagon have led administration officials to consider canceling a contract worth up to $200 million.Anthropic was the first AI model developer to be used in classified operations by the Department of Defense, according to people familiar with the matter cited by The Wall Street Journal. It remains unclear whether other AI tools were used in the Venezuela operation for unclassified tasks.The Pentagon has been pushing leading AI companies, including OpenAI and Anthropic, to make their tools available on classified networks without many of the standard restrictions applied to commercial users, Reuters exclusively reported earlier this week.Many AI companies are building custom systems for the US military, although most operate only on unclassified networks used for administrative functions. Anthropic is currently the only major AI developer whose system is accessible in classified settings through third parties, though government users remain bound by its usage policies.Anthropic, which recently raised $30 billion in a funding round valuing it at $380 billion, has positioned itself as a safety focused AI company. Chief Executive Dario Amodei has publicly called for stronger regulation and guardrails to mitigate risks from advanced AI systems.At a January event announcing Pentagon collaboration with xAI, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the agency would not “employ AI models that won’t allow you to fight wars,” referring to discussions administration officials have had with Anthropic, The Wall Street Journal reported.The evolving relationship between AI developers and the Pentagon reflects a broader shift in defense strategy, as artificial intelligence tools are increasingly used for tasks ranging from document analysis and intelligence summarization to support for autonomous systems.The reported use of Claude in the Maduro raid underscores the expanding role of commercial AI models in US military operations, even as debates continue over ethical limits, usage policies and regulatory oversight.Anthropic’s Claude is an advanced artificial intelligence chatbot and large language model designed for text generation, reasoning, coding and data analysis, developed by US-based AI company Anthropic.Claude is part of a family of large language models built to compete with systems such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. It can summarise documents, answer complex queries, generate reports, assist with programming tasks and analyse large volumes of text.Anthropic positions Claude as a safety-focused AI system. The company has built usage policies that prohibit the model from being used to support violence, develop weapons or conduct surveillance. Claude is available to enterprises and government clients, including on certain classified networks through approved partnerships.Founded in 2021 by former OpenAI executives including CEO Dario Amodei, Anthropic has emerged as one of the leading AI startups globally, with backing from major technology investors and a valuation running into hundreds of billions of dollar","Anthropic’s artificial intelligence model Claude was used in the US military operation that captured former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, The Wall Street Journal reported.

How the Religious Diversity Index works





Pew Research Center’s Religious Diversity Index (RDI) scores countries on a scale from 0 to 10, measuring how evenly their populations are distributed across seven religious categories.

Diversity among the world’s largest countries

Regional patterns

Singapore has been named the world’s most religiously diverse country in a sweeping study of 201 nations, reflecting how evenly its population is spread across seven major faith categories.The findings capture broader shifts underway globally. Christians remain the largest group at 2.3 billion, though their share of the world’s population has edged down. Muslims are the fastest-growing major religion, expanding by 347 million over the past decade. Hindus grew by 126 million to reach 1.2 billion, holding steady at 14.9% of the global population. Meanwhile, the religiously unaffiliated now account for 24.2% worldwide, the third-largest category, and Buddhists are the only major faith to decline in absolute numbers.At the opposite end of the diversity scale, Yemen, Afghanistan and Somalia rank among the least religiously diverse, while the Asia-Pacific region stands out as the most varied overall.These findings are drawn from a Pew Research Center report released in February 2026 as part of the Pew-Templeton Global Religious Futures project, funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts, the John Templeton Foundation and Templeton Religion Trust.The study ranks countries using a Religious Diversity Index (RDI) based on how evenly populations are distributed across seven groups: Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews, adherents of all other religions, and people with no religious affiliation.The rankings rely on demowhich synthesised more than 2,700 censuses and surveys. Each of the 201 countries and territories included had at least 100,000 residents in 2010 or 2020, collectively accounting for 99.98% of the global population in 2020.Pew’s Religious Diversity Index (RDI) assigns countries a score between 0 and 10. A score of 0 represents complete homogeneity, a population composed entirely of one religious group. A score of 10 would represent a perfectly even split among seven categories: Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews, adherents of other religions, and people with no religious affiliation, each group making up roughly 14% of the population. No country achieved a perfect 10.The “other religions” category encompasses faiths such as Baha’is, Daoists, Jains, Shintoists, Sikhs, Wiccans and Zoroastrians, as well as numerous smaller groups, including those often described as folk or traditional religions.Of the 201 countries and territories studied, eight fall into the “very high” diversity range (scores between 7.0 and 10.0). At the other end of the scale, 41 countries are classified as “very low” diversity, with scores below 1.0. The largest number, 89 countries, sit in the middle, categorised as moderately diverse.With a score of 9.3, Singapore comes closer than any other country to an even distribution across the seven categories.Buddhists form 31% of Singapore’s population, making them the largest group. But they are followed closely by religiously unaffiliated residents at 20%, Christians at 19%, Muslims at 16%, Hindus at 5%, and adherents of other religions at 9%. No single group holds a majority.Suriname ranks second and is the only Latin American country in the top 10. Its population is 53% Christian, 22% Hindu, 13% Muslim and 8% religiously unaffiliated, a demographic pattern shaped in part by descendants of 19th-century indentured labourers from British India.Most other countries in the top 10 are located either in the Asia-Pacific region, Taiwan, South Korea and Australia, or in sub-Saharan Africa, Mauritius, Guinea-Bissau, Togo and Benin. France is the only European country in the top 10. Its population is 46% Christian, 43% religiously unaffiliated and 9% Muslim, giving it an RDI score of 6.9. For comparison, South Korea scores 7.3 and the United States 5.8.No country scores a perfect zero. But Yemen, Afghanistan and Somalia come closest. In each, Muslims account for 99.8% or more of the population.Overall, Muslims make up at least 99% of the population in eight of the ten least religiously diverse countries and territories. The remaining two, Timor-Leste and Moldova, are almost entirely Christian.Regionally, the Middle East and North Africa has the lowest diversity score at 1.3. The region’s population is 94% Muslim and includes five of the world’s ten least diverse places: Yemen, Morocco, Western Sahara, Iraq and Tunisia.The study also revisits how the world’s religious composition shifted over the decade.Christians remain the largest religious group globally. Their numbers rose by 122 million to reach 2.3 billion. But as a share of the global population, Christians declined by 1.8 percentage points, falling to 28.8%.Muslims were the fastest-growing group. Their population increased by 347 million, more than all other religions combined, and their global share rose by 1.8 percentage points to 25.6%.People with no religious affiliation, often called “nones,” grew by 270 million to 1.9 billion, increasing their share to 24.2% of the global population. This growth occurred despite the group being older on average and having lower fertility rates, partly because of religious “switching,”particularly Christians disaffiliating.Hindus increased by 126 million to 1.2 billion and held steady at 14.9% of the global population.Buddhists were the only major group to decline numerically, dropping by 19 million to 324 million and slipping to 4.1% of the global population.The global Jewish population grew by nearly 1 million to 14.8 million and remained about 0.2% of the world’s population, the smallest group in the study.All other religions combined account for 2.2% of the global population and grew in line with overall population expansion.As of 2020, 75.8% of the world’s population identifies with a religion, while 24.2% does not. In 2010, those figures were 76.7% and 23.3%, respectively.Among the 10 most populous countries, each with at least 120 million people and together accounting for nearly 60% of the global population, the United States is the most religiously diverse. Christians make up 64% of its population, religiously unaffiliated people account for about 30%, and the remaining 6% are Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews and adherents of other religions, each representing roughly 1–2%.Nigeria is the second-most diverse among these large countries. Muslims and Christians each comprise more than 40% of its population, making it one of the most evenly split countries between two religious groups.Pakistan, by contrast, is the least diverse among the ten. Muslims account for 97% of its population, giving it an RDI score of 0.8, compared with 5.8 in the United States.The Asia-Pacific region is the most religiously diverse overall, with an RDI score of 8.7. No single group forms a majority there. The largest category, religiously unaffiliated people, represents roughly one-third of the region’s population. The region includes large populations of Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and adherents of other religions; Jews have a relatively small presence.North America (6.0), sub-Saharan Africa (5.9) and Europe (5.6) are classified as highly diverse. In each of these regions, Christians form the majority. The second-largest group comprises at least a quarter of the population, religiously unaffiliated people in North America and Europe, and Muslims in sub-Saharan Africa.Latin America and the Caribbean fall into the moderate category, with an RDI score of 3.1. The region has a strong Christian majority and a smaller share of unaffiliated residents.","Singapore is the world’s most religiously diverse country, with Buddhists, Christians, Muslims, Hindus, unaffiliated, and other faiths all represented.

Flexible and remote work provisions







The UAE has announced reduced working hours for public and private sector employees during the holy month of Ramadan.The Federal Authority for Government Human Resources confirmed the official working hours for ministries and federal entities during Ramadan.From Monday to Thursday, working hours will run from 9:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. On Fridays, employees will work from 9am to noon. The schedule applies across federal ministries and entities, except for employees whose job nature requires otherwise.In a statement published on its official website, the authority noted that flexible working regulations may continue to be applied during Ramadan, provided that the approved daily working hours are met.It further clarified that federal entities may grant employees flexibility to work remotely on Fridays. However, remote work must not exceed 70 per cent of the entity’s total workforce, and must comply with approved regulations and controls.For the private sector, the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation announced that daily working hours will be reduced by two hours throughout Ramadan.Employees in the UAE typically work eight to nine hours per day.During Ramadan, this schedule will be reduced by two hours daily in line with the Islamic holy month.The ministry stated that private sector companies may implement flexible or remote working arrangements within the limits of the reduced daily working hours. These arrangements must align with the company's business interests and the nature of its operations.Any additional hours worked beyond the reduced Ramadan schedule will be treated as overtime. Employees will be entitled to extra compensation for overtime hours in accordance with labour regulations.Across both sectors, authorities have provided room for flexibility while maintaining operational continuity.Federal entities may continue applying approved flexible work systems during working days in Ramadan. In addition, they may allow remote work on Fridays, subject to the 70 per cent cap.In the private sector, companies are permitted to introduce flexible or remote schedules, provided they remain within the reduced daily working hour framework.The revised timings aim to accommodate the spiritual and social rhythms of Ramadan while ensuring that government services and business operations continue without disruption.","UAE reduces official working hours for public and private sector employees during Ramadan.

Clarification beyond the British curriculum









The Ministry of Education has updated enrolment age requirements for the Foundation Stage in private schools implementing the British curriculum, introducing new assessment provisions from the 2026–2027 academic year.The move follows the extension of the school admission age cut-off from August 31 to December 31, a shift that made eligibility dependent on the admission year rather than the month the academic year begins.Under the revised framework, children born between September 1 and December 31 who do not turn three by the start of the academic year will be subject to a readiness assessment conducted by the school in consultation with parents.If the child is deemed ready, they may join Foundation Stage 1. If not, enrolment in FS1 can take place in the following academic year. The ministry has confirmed that this arrangement will apply annually starting from 2026–2027.A separate, one-time transitional measure applies to children born between September 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022, who are not enrolled in any educational system.During the 2026–2027 academic year only, schools and parents will jointly determine whether Foundation Stage 1 or Foundation Stage 2 is the more suitable placement, based on the school’s readiness assessment.The ministry has made clear that once a child is enrolled in a grade, they may not be transferred to another grade at a later stage. Placement decisions will therefore be final once admission is completed.The authority also addressed concerns in other curricula, particularly regarding children born between September 1 and December 31, 2021, who were not eligible for enrolment in the 2025–2026 academic year.Those students may register in Kindergarten 1 in the 2026–2027 academic year.According to the ministry, the revised measures are intended to ensure equal opportunities for students while supporting both their educational and social readiness.",The Ministry of Education has updated enrolment age requirements for the Foundation Stage in private schools implementing the British curriculum.

: US taxpayers can track their income tax refund status using the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) “ Where’s My Refund ” tool, which provides near real-time updates on refund processing stages, expected timelines and payment status.According to information available on the IRS website, refund status generally becomes visible within 24 hours after e-filing a current-year return, 3–4 days after e-filing a prior-year return, and around four weeks after filing a paper return. The system updates once daily, usually overnight, and is typically unavailable between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. Eastern Time due to routine updates.To access refund details, taxpayers must provide:Refund status can also be checked through the IRS2Go mobile application, apart from the online tracker.The “Where’s My Refund” tool shows three key processing stages:Refunds may take longer if:Taxpayers are advised not to file a duplicate return, as it can delay processing. Refiling is recommended only if a paper return was filed more than six months ago, a refund is due, and the tracker does not show receipt of the return.Refund status for amended returns (Form 1040-X) is not available on the main tracker and must be checked separately through the “Where’s My Amended Return” tool.If a refund cheque is lost, stolen or destroyed, taxpayers can usually file a replacement claim online after 28 days from the mailing date.For refund status related to federal returns other than individual Form 1040 filings, taxpayers must contact IRS helplines directly, as this data is not available through the standard refund tracker.","US taxpayers can track their income tax refund status using the Internal Revenue Service’s “ Where's My Refund ” tool.

Kathy Ruemmler: Top Goldman Sachs lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler resigns over Epstein links — details of exchange emerge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uncle-jeffrey-top-goldman-sachs-lawyer-kathryn-ruemmler-resigns-over-epstein-links-details-of-exchange-emerge/articleshow/128286821.cms,"Newly Released Epstein Videos Suggest Victims Were Forced Into Disturbing 'Auditions'

Ruemmler's ties to Epstein

Emails detail advice, personal exchanges and years-long ties





Kathryn Ruemmler, chief legal officer at Goldman Sachs and one of the highest paid lawyers in the US, resigned on Thursday night after the justice department released emails and other documents detailing her extensive relationship with infamous financier and convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein For years, Ruemmler and the financial services firm had maintained that her contact with Epstein was strictly professional. However, emails, text messages and photographs released to the public last month presented a completely different picture, indicating that the lawyer had been closer to him even before she joined Goldman in 2020.Goldman’s chief executive David M Solomon said in a statement that he had accepted her resignation, “and I respect her decision.”Ruemmler had been general counsel since 2021 and also served as a partner and vice chair of the bank’s reputational risk committee. Earlier, she worked as White House counsel under Barack Obama and later as a white-collar defence lawyer at Latham & Watkins.“My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs' interests first,” Ruemmler said.Goldman had defended her in recent weeks, saying that her links with Epstein happened before she was hired and were appropriate.However, the Justice Department’s latest release, more than 10,000 documents mentioning her, showed a relationship that stretched over many years.The records showed Ruemmler acting as a counsellor, confidant and friend to Epstein. She advised him on how to answer difficult questions about his sex crimes, spoke about her own dating life, discussed ways to avoid negative media coverage and called him “sweetie” and “Uncle Jeffrey”.According to The Guardian, an email “So lovely and thoughtful! Thank you to Uncle Jeffrey!!!” Ruemmler wrote to Epstein in 2018.In return, Epstein offered career guidance about her move to Goldman, introduced her to prominent businesspeople and gave her gifts including spa treatments, luxury goods and high-end travel. Furthermore, within the hundreds of messages examined by CNN about Epstein’s legal troubles and damage to his reputation, there were also more intimate notes between the pair, including talk of a potential trip to his island and references to presents he had given her.From 2014, Kathryn began what she described in one email as a “friendship”. She explained Epstein how the law distinguishes between underage victims of sex crimes and adult prostitutes. “I think the point is that if she was underage, she could not legally consent to engaging in prostitution,” Ruemmler wrote to Epstein in 2015.She also advised the disgraced financer on how to challenge the credibility of an accuser, saying in one message that his lawyer could push the woman into a “perjury trap.”Back in 2015, on Epstein’s 62nd birthday, Ruemmler sent him an email, writing, “I hope you enjoy the day with your one true love. :-)”. Some emails ended with “xoxo”, and the two exchanged photographs. In other conversations, she joked about the weight of visitors at New Jersey rest stops and speculated about the sexual orientation of a well-known hedge fund billionaire, according to the New York Times.Ruemmler, over a series of meetings, also asked for Epstein’s views on personal and professional issues, including her dating concerns. “men aren't interested in women my age,” one email said.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs and Ruemmler have maintained that Epstein was never her client. Yet in 2018, when she helped him edit a legal document defending his 2008 plea deal for soliciting prostitution from a minor, the emails between them carried the subject line, “Attorney Client.”","Kathryn Ruemmler, chief legal officer at Goldman Sachs and one of the highest paid lawyers in the US, resigned on Thursday night.

'We Don't Belong To Trump': Venezuela Rises Against 'Colonial' US: Caracas Erupts For Maduro Return





US President Donald Trump said on Friday that ties between the United States and Venezuela are “very good” and announced plans to visit the country.""I'm going to make a visit to Venezuela,"" Trump said, mentioning that the date has not been fixed yet.“We have a very good relationship with the president of Venezuela,” he said.He added that Washington is “working together very closely” with Venezuela's interim leader Delcy Rodriguez on access to oil, noting that he had officially recognised the government.“The relationship we have right now with Venezuela I would say is a 10,” he said, as cited by Reuters.In recent weeks, Trump administration officials had indicated that Washington did not recognise Rodriguez’s interim government as legitimate.Trump’s comments came after a visit to Caracas earlier this week by the US energy secretary and as his administration eased additional sanctions that had blocked investment in Venezuela’s oil sector.On Friday, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued general licences to BP, Chevron, Eni, Repsol and Shell, authorising certain transactions related to oil and gas operations in the country under specific conditions.“These general licenses invite American and other aligned companies to play a constructive role in supporting economic recovery and responsible investment,” a Trump administration media note said, describing the OFAC move as part of Trump’s commitment to “rapidly” reopen the oil industry.""The United States is committed to restoring Venezuela's prosperity, safety, and security for the benefit of both the American and Venezuelan people,"" the note added, as cited by AFP.Trump and senior officials, including Energy Secretary Chris Wright, have openly suggested that Washington would play a dominant role in managing Venezuela’s oil resources for the foreseeable future.The global oil industry has also expressed interest in returning to the petroleum-rich country but has warned that major investments would depend on clear and stable rules, following past expropriations under earlier governments.Meanwhile, the US State Department said on Friday it had sent more than six tonnes of medical supplies to Venezuela to help stabilise the country.Venezuela produced about 1.2 million barrels of oil per day in 2025, up from a historic low of roughly 360,000 barrels per day in 2020. It is still far below the 3 million barrels per day it pumped 25 years ago.",US President Donald Trump said on Friday that ties between the United States and Venezuela are “very good” and announced plans to visit the country.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has finally explained the real reason he called Donald Trump “Daddy” — and says it’s not what many people think.In an interview with Politico, Rutte insisted the remark was “never intentional,” attributing it — in otherwise fluent English — to what he called his “insufficient command of the English language,” while firmly dismissing any suggestion of personal subtext.Describing Trump as a “fun guy” with “a lot of humor,” Rutte acknowledged that the nickname has since taken on a life of its own, adding with a shrug: “I’m living with it.”""We had the NATO summit in Iraq and Donald Trump, the president, and I had a meeting before, and it was a press play. And that was exactly on the morning after the day where he took out the nuclear facilities in Iran. And I was very happy with that. And I complimented him with doing that through the B2s. And it was when he was also having some arguments with the Israelis. And then I said, and here is my insufficient command of the English language,"" Rutte said.""I said, yeah, Daddy sometimes has to be tough. And of course, later realizing that the word daddy has a lot of connotations, then what he did, and this is to his credit, because he is a fun guy and he has a lot of humor. The American side then put this on T shirts. There was a video when he came back from the D.Hague summit where he said, daddy is home. So there it was born and it was never intentioned. But again, I'm now carrying it, living with it. It's a fact. Now he's Daddy. I think you could take some ownership of Daddy just a little bit. Okay, I'll take that advice,"" he added.Trump, in the past, had repeatedly said that Rutte called him ""Daddy.""At the Davos speech, Trump said, ""Until the last few days, when I told them about Iceland, they loved me,"" he said.""They called me daddy, right, the last time.""Factually, Last year, Rutte did called him ""Daddy.""","NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has finally explained the real reason he called Donald Trump “Daddy” Rutte acknowledged that the nickname has since taken on a life of its own, adding with a shrug: “I’m living with it.”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128323338,imgsize-44738,width-400,resizemode-4/62nd-munich-security-conference.jpg"

Trump administration ends deportation protections for Yemenis in US — what is TPS and what happens after termination?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-ends-deportation-protections-for-yemenis-in-us-what-is-tps-and-what-happens-after-termination/articleshow/128318327.cms,"Kristi Noem Admits DHS “Messed Up” in ICE Operations Amid Impeachment Threat? | WATCH

What is TPS?

What happens when TPS ends?

What can you do next?





The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Friday moved to end deportation protections for people from Yemen, the 13th country from which the Trump administration struck the status.The move left just 4 countries that the administration did not seek to end what is known as Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which bars immigration agencies from deporting nationals back to countries experiencing a natural disaster or civil unrest.Roughly 1,400 Yemenis currently in the US are protected from deportation under TPS.“After reviewing conditions in the country and consulting with appropriate US govt agencies, I determined that Yemen no longer meets the law’s requirements to be designated for Temporary Protected Status,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a release.“Allowing TPS Yemen beneficiaries to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interest,” she added. “TPS was designed to be temporary, and this administration is returning TPS to its original temporary intent. We are prioritising our national security interests and putting America first.”Yemeni citizens were continually protected under TPS since 2015.When Noem’s predecessor, former Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, redesignated Yemen for the protection, he wrote that the country was on “the brink of economic collapse”.“Yemen was in a state of protracted conflict for the past decade, severely limiting civilians’ access to water, food, and medical care, pushing the country to the brink of economic collapse, and preventing Yemeni nationals living abroad from safely returning home,” he wrote in the 2024 designation.DHS continually faced roadblocks in court as it tried to lift TPS, though those rulings were not always helpful to the recipients, who in some cases were still forced to leave the country as litigation continued.The Secretary of Homeland Security may designate a foreign country for TPS due to conditions in the country that temporarily prevent the country's nationals from returning safely, or in certain circumstances, where the country is unable to handle the return of its nationals adequately. USCIS may grant TPS to eligible nationals of certain countries (or parts of countries), who are already in the United States. Eligible individuals without nationality who last resided in the designated country may also be granted TPS, USIC.gov reported.When the U.S. government terminates TPS for a country, beneficiaries are required to either adjust to another legal status or prepare to leave the US, a legal group said.This process can involve:Receiving an official notice from USCIS.Having a deadline to leave the U.S. or apply for another form of relief.Potentially facing detention or removal proceedings if no alternative status is obtained.Even if your TPS has ended, you may still have options to remain in the U.S.:Apply for asylum: If you fear persecution in your home country due to race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.Apply for U or T Visas: These visas are available for victims of certain crimes (U Visa) or human trafficking (T Visa).Family-based immigration: You may be eligible to stay in the U.S. through family sponsorship by a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.Be sure to keep copies of all notices from USCIS or DHS and act quickly to protect your status.","Yemen is the 13th country from which the Trump administration struck the status.

Trump ‘uncomfortable’ with Noem and Lewandowski’s relationship





A bombshell report from The Wall Street Journal alleged that department of home secretary has been gripped by “constant chaos” under Secretary Kristi Noem , painting a portrait of a department where headline-grabbing crackdowns, glossy photo-ops and internal power struggles collide behind closed doors.According to the paper’s sources, Noem has leaned heavily into high-visibility immigration enforcement — complete with agency-branded flak jackets and carefully staged imagery — while sidelining critics and consolidating control.The Wall Street Journal cited sources within the department who were highly critical of Noem’s reign and painted an unflattering portrait of the Secretary as a politician who sought to “burnish her personal stardom at every turn.”Noem “staged a headline-grabbing immigration crackdown while sidelining rivals and dissenters,” the newspaper stated, noting the Secretary’s penchant for posing in agency-branded flak jackets and caps and bearing guns as props, “all with an eye to her style, with TV-ready hair and make-up.”Here is a look at some of the key claims made against the Secretary.A lost blanket gets a Coast Guard pilot fired. Among the stranger controversies alleged is one claiming that Noem ordered a Coast Guard pilot to be fired after she was forced to switch from 1 plane to another because of a maintenance issue, which caused a favourite blanket to be left behind amid the confusion.The pilot was abruptly told he was dismissed over the blunder and ordered to take a commercial flight home, only to then be advised that he was, in fact, reinstated because no one else was available to continue the journey, according to the WSJ.The DHS spokesperson did not address the incident but claimed instead that the secretary “made personnel decisions to deliver excellence”.Another bizarre claim made in the report is that Noem’s top adviser “made it known to top ICE officials that he wanted to be issued a law enforcement badge and a federally issued gun”, despite his not undertaking the necessary training to merit them.When the administration was preparing to bring in Tom Feeley, a former top ICE official in New York, as its new director, he was asked by Lewandowski if he was willing to issue him with the props, the newspaper writes. Feeley said no and was subsequently overlooked for the role.ICE lawyer Ken Padilla, in turn, reportedly refused the same request and was placed on administrative leave before being demoted to a role with FEMA.Lewandowski ultimately got his gun, the WSJ reports, but only after it was allegedly signed off by an ICE director’s autopen—an ironic detail given Trump’s mockery and conspiracy theorising over his predecessor Joe Biden’s use of such a device.The DHS spokesperson denied the newspaper’s version of events, saying Lewandowski made no such efforts to secure a gun or signed paperwork, and said that he did not speak to Feeley and that Padilla was put on leave for other reasons.Similar retaliatory tactics were also reported in the case of Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott, whom Noem and Lewandowski allegedly attempted to force out by reassigning his chief of staff and pressuring his deputy to resign.Scott himself is a Senate appointee and thus out of the secretary’s jurisdiction.It was long rumoured that the Secretary and her top adviser, both of whom are married, engaged in an extramarital affair. They repeatedly denied the allegations, and the Secretary called them a “disgusting lie.”The WSJ nevertheless revived them and reported that “the close relationship already made President Trump and his top advisers uncomfortable,” adding that the President rejected the idea of Lewandowski serving as Noem’s chief of staff “due to reports of a romantic relationship between the 2 – which he continued to bring up, officials say.”The newspaper reported that Noem moved into a govt-owned waterfront house on a military base in Washington, DC, provided for the head of the Coast Guard, after tabloid photos of Lewandowski “showed him going back and forth between his apartment and Noem’s across the street last year.”A DHS spokesperson told the WSJ that Noem moved into the house for security reasons and said she pays rent at the property, also advising the paper not to “waste time with salacious, baseless gossip.”","Wall Street Journal claims that Department of home secretary has been gripped by ‘constant chaos’ under Secretary Kristi Noem.

The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Thursday directed authorities to constitute a medical board to assess the health of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan after reports surfaced about a loss of vision in one of his eyes.A bench comprising Chief Justice Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan also instructed officials to facilitate communication between Khan and his two sons, who live in the United Kingdom with his former wife, British producer and screenwriter Jemima Goldsmith.“The issue of Imran’s health is most important. Intervention is necessary. His phone calls with his son are also important,” Chief Justice Afridi said during the hearing.The order came after the bench resumed hearing a case about the jail conditions of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder-president and ordered a detailed medical check-up before February 16. During the hearing, Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan said it was the state’s responsibility to provide the former prime minister with medical care.The order also came two days after the court asked PTI leader and lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Khan at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where the cricketer-turned-politician has been held since August 5, 2023, following his conviction in a corruption case.Safdar later submitted his report to the court after meeting Khan. It was the first meeting with the jailed leader since December 2, when his sister, Uzma Khan, was allowed to see him for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, Dawn newspaper, citing the report, noted that it detailed Safdar’s meeting with Khan, the condition of his cell, the facilities provided to him, a description of his living area and the process the lawyer followed to reach the jail.In the report, Safdar quoted Khan as stating that despite receiving treatment, including an injection, he has only 15% vision left in his right eye.Khan reportedly told Safdar that until October 2025, he had normal vision in both eyes. He later began experiencing constant blurred and hazy vision, which he repeatedly reported to the then jail superintendent, but no action was taken.The report added that Khan eventually suffered a sudden and complete loss of vision in his right eye. An eye specialist from Pims Hospital, Dr Muhammad Arif, was then called to examine him.He was diagnosed with a blood clot that caused serious damage. Despite treatment, including an injection, his vision in the right eye remains at only 15 per cent.A day earlier, Safdar denied making any statement about Khan’s health on Tuesday, clarifying that anything attributed to him on the matter had been misrepresented or misreported.However, on the day he met Khan, Safdar told reporters that the jailed leader was “fine and healthy.”","Supreme Court of Pakistan orders medical board to assess Imran Khan's health.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has delivered a scathing assessment of his country’s past alliances with Washington, telling the National Assembly that Islamabad had been “used like toilet paper and then discarded” after serving American interests in Afghanistan.Speaking during a debate on terrorism following a deadly suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Islamabad, Asif said Pakistan had repeatedly joined “superpower wars” that were never its own.“We took part in two wars that were fought on the soil of Afghanistan,” Asif told lawmakers. Referring to the Soviet intervention in 1979, he claimed it was carried out “at the invitation of the government in Kabul” and that the narrative of an outright invasion was shaped by the United States.Pakistan, he said, entered those conflicts “in the name of Islam and religion”, but in reality two former military dictators sought legitimacy and the backing of a global power.“These were not our wars; they were superpower wars,” he said, adding that Pakistan and its land were used and then discarded ""like toilet paper.""Asif went on to describe terrorism in Pakistan as the “blowback of mistakes committed by dictators in the past”.He added that Pakistan had failed to learn from history, continuing to shift between Washington, Moscow and London in pursuit of short-term interests.""For our own interests, we sometimes turn to Washington, sometimes to Moscow, and sometimes to Britain. We have built strong franchises here, which was not the case 30 or 40 years ago,"" Asif said.Recalling then US President Bill Clinton’s brief stop in Islamabad in 2000, a visit lasting only a few hours at the end of a longer India trip, Asif said it underscored how transactional the relationship had become. Clinton’s engagement with then military ruler Pervez Musharraf was framed by US demands on democracy, non-proliferation and militancy, reinforcing.Asif’s remarks came as parliament passed a resolution condemning the attack on Imambargah Qasr-e-Khadijatul Kubra in Islamabad’s Tarlai area, where a suicide bomber killed 31 people and wounded 169 during Friday prayers. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. Thousands attended funerals across the capital as grieving families demanded accountability. “What happened yesterday has left us extremely angry and deeply hurt,” said Bushra Rahmani, whose brother was among the wounded.The minister urged political unity, lamenting what he called a lack of consensus even in condemning terrorism. “It is very important that we have a national identity on which no one disagrees,” he said, criticising those who, for political reasons, avoided attending the funerals of victims.","Defence minister Khawaja Asif criticises Pakistan's past alliances with the U.S. and Russia.

‘China no longer trusts us’

Backdrop of deadly Islamabad attack





Pakistan’s Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy, questioning how extremist elements continue to cross the border even as trade remains blocked.Speaking at a public gathering in Rawalpindi, Rehman highlighted what he described as a glaring contradiction in Islamabad’s approach towards Afghanistan. “In all these decades, we never paused to ask why our Afghan policy failed so miserably. Not a single pomegranate or melon can enter Pakistan, yet terrorists keep crossing the border,” he said, smiling as he made the remark.Referring to repeated claims by Pakistani authorities that militants were entering from Afghanistan, Rehman added, “Authorities say terrorists are coming from there. If they are coming, stop them. If they are coming, eliminate them. The Afghan government has never objected to your actions.”The JUI-F leader also criticised Pakistan’s broader foreign and economic policies, calling them “complete failures”. He said Islamabad’s diplomatic approach had left the country increasingly isolated.“India is our enemy, Afghanistan is our enemy, and even Iran and China are upset with us,” Rehman said, adding that the public deserved answers.“A nation cannot survive when its policies produce only isolation, mistrust and insecurity.”He argued that Pakistan’s foreign policy was being driven not by elected governments but by the military establishment. “One general comes and says we will negotiate; another comes and says we will wage war,” he said.Rehman also took aim at the government’s handling of the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC), claiming that the flagship infrastructure project had stalled due to declining Chinese confidence.“CPEC has seen no real progress during this tenure because China no longer trusts us,” he said, questioning whether “even a single brick” had moved under the current government. He claimed Beijing had expected the Pakistan democratic movement (PDM) government to stabilise relations and revive projects, but remained dissatisfied.Rehman’s remarks come amid heightened tensions following a suicide bombing at a mosque in Islamabad on Friday that killed 69 people and injured more than 170, according to local media reports citing hospital officials. The blast occurred during Friday prayers at Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra in the Tarlai area, Dawn reported.After Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif suggested on X that preliminary findings pointed to the attacker having travelled to and from Afghanistan, Kabul rejected the allegation. Afghanistan’s ministry of national defence termed the claim “irresponsible and baseless” and urged Pakistani authorities to take responsibility for internal security lapses, Afghan media outlet Ariana News reported.The Afghan ministry said similar accusations had been made in the past following attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, without conclusive evidence.","Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman criticises Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy.

'Not Vassals Of Trump & Elon Musk': Spain's Deputy PM Makes Blistering Exit From 'Place Of Hate' X





Pakistan’s decision on granting a licence to Starlink to operate in its satellite internet market has been delayed amid data security concerns, geopolitical sensitivities and competition from Chinese firms, local media reported on Sunday.Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk , is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan. However, officials say unresolved security considerations and broader geopolitical factors have slowed the clearance process.According to the Express Tribune, the government has raised concerns that Starlink’s services could allow certain data transmissions to bypass Pakistan’s monitoring, regulatory and safety checks. “We cannot allow a license to Starlink without ensuring a safety check to ensure the safety of the data of consumers in Pakistan,” a senior government official was quoted as saying by Express Tribune.Sources cited by the newspaper said authorities had tested scenarios in which Starlink was expected to pick up sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services. “But the real reason is that the government has tested some cases in which Starlink was supposed to pick up some sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services,” sources said.Officials added that the government is working to address these issues, which have delayed the approval process.The report also cited the fallout between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk as a factor being weighed by the Pakistani establishment. While Trump and Musk had enjoyed a close relationship in the past, they later drifted apart. Officials indicated that Pakistan, which has seen improved ties with the United States since Trump returned to power last year, is cautious about taking steps that could draw scrutiny from Washington.At present, Pakistan maintains control over internet data traffic largely through Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited, which holds a majority stake in the country’s undersea cable infrastructure. Authorities are concerned that similar oversight may not be feasible with satellite-based services, raising fears of potential data breaches or loss of regulatory control.Satellite internet services are expected to focus primarily on remote and underserved regions, including Balochistan, where conventional broadband infrastructure remains limited. Currently, authorities are able to monitor internet traffic and suspend connectivity when required for security reasons. Officials have expressed concern that enforcing similar controls over satellite-based networks could prove more challenging.The Pakistan Space Activities Regulatory Board has confirmed that five companies, including Starlink and China-based Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology Limited, have shown interest in entering the satellite internet market. Chinese firms already have a strong presence in Pakistan’s telecommunications sector and are viewed as direct competitors to US-based companies such as Starlink.While consultations with stakeholders have been completed, the PSARB has yet to finalise the licensing framework. According to officials, additional time is needed to establish safety mechanisms before satellite-based internet services are permitted to begin operations.","Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday.

Amaq claimed over 200 casualties in contrast to the official Pak govt admission of 36 deaths and injuries to scores.The suicide bomber was identified by Amaq as Saifullah Ansari. His photograph taking the bayah (oath of allegiance) was also posted by the IS mouthpiece. The statement also mentioned that hundreds of Pakistani Shias had joined the pro-Iran 'Zaynabiyoun brigade' militia in Syria.The claim by Amaq followed an official denial by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which strongly rebutted any involvement in the incident.The blast, which occurred during prayers at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque in Tarlai area, was the deadliest in Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.The explosion coincided with the visit of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to Pakistan. The attack is being seen as a result of growing sectarian tensions in the country.Earlier in Jan, ISKP had claimed responsibility for a blast in Bajaur district that killed a senior Lashkar commander named Najibullah.","Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday.

'Home-Grown Ills': Islamabad Mosque Blast Triggers Blame Game As India Rejects Pakistan's Blame





The Islamic State on Saturday claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad, which killed at least 36 people and injured many others.In a statement released through its Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State in Pakistan, an offshoot of Daesh, said the bomber opened fire at security guards when they tried to stop him at the entrance and then exploded inside among worshippers.The group also said Shiite Muslims in Pakistan were a target, claiming they provided recruits to militias fighting the Islamic State in Syria.The blast took place on Friday at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque-cum-shrine in the Tarlie area of the capital. The attacker, identified as 32-year-old Yasir from Peshawar, entered the mosque while worshippers were offering weekly prayers and detonated explosives.Authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said they arrested four suspects, including three alleged facilitators and the mastermind, during intelligence-based raids in Peshawar and Nowshera.Investigators said an identity card recovered during the probe confirmed the attacker’s identity. Official records showed his permanent address in Abbas Colony on Charsadda Road in Peshawar.Officials also said the attacker had spent around five months in Afghanistan before the bombing, where he allegedly received training in weapons handling and suicide attacks.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif had earlier claimed that India and Afghanistan were involved in the attack, without presenting any evidence.India had strongly rejected the allegations, saying, ""It is unfortunate that, instead of seriously addressing the problems plaguing its social fabric, Pakistan should choose to delude itself by blaming others for its home-grown ills.

Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States aimed at easing tensions between the two countries, slated to take place on Friday in Turkey.“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query, reported Dawn.Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar is expected to take part in the meeting, the daily reported citing a diplomatic source, adding that “Islamabad’s participation was seen as significant.”An Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the meeting is likely to be held in Turkiye on Friday. The format of the talks remains unclear, though the official said the main meeting would take place that day.A regional official told Reuters that the priority of the talks was to avoid conflict and de-escalate tensions between Iran and the US, adding that several regional powers had been invited at the foreign ministers’ level.According to the official, countries invited include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).US outlet Axios, citing two sources and a US official, reported that Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible agreement related to Iran’s nuclear programme.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had instructed Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” in an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.The talks, he said in posts on X, would be held “within the framework of our national interests”.US President Donald Trump has said he is hopeful Washington would “work something out” with Iran but warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal was reached.In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”“In return, we expect sanctions to be lifted,” he added, while warning that Iran was prepared for war if talks failed, saying any conflict would likely spread beyond Iran.Turkiye has been leading diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and engaging with regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.","Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States.

A Pakistani anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan, sister of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan in connection with a protest held in Islamabad in November 2024.According to news agency PTI citing a media report, the warrants were issued by the ATC in Rawalpindi after Aleema Khan failed to appear before the court despite earlier directions.The court also issued non-bailable arrest warrants against her two guarantors and ordered that all three be arrested and produced before it on Wednesday, without fail. Aleema’s application seeking exemption from personal appearance was rejected.The case, registered at Sadiqabad Police Station, relates to a protest at D-Chowk in Islamabad on November 24, 2024 and includes charges of protesting against the government, chanting anti-government slogans, vandalism and stone-pelting. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing.The court also issued a show-cause notice to the Superintendent of Police (SP), Rawal, for failing to execute the arrest warrants.The SP has been directed to appear before the court on Wednesday and explain why Aleema Khan was not arrested and presented despite clear orders, according to Pakistani news website Express Tribune.During Monday’s hearing, Aleema Khan’s defence counsel sought a one-day exemption, citing difficulties in travel and daily affairs after her bank accounts, Computerised National Identity Card and passport were reportedly blocked. The court, however, did not accept the plea.The proceedings have drawn attention as Aleema Khan had earlier skipped multiple hearings in the case and appeared only after the court issued property seizure orders and several arrest warrants. She is among those nominated as accused in protest-related cases filed following the November demonstrations.The protest followed Imran Khan’s “final call” for nationwide demonstrations demanding the restoration of the party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) electoral mandate, the release of party leaders and the reversal of constitutional changes.The D-Chowk protest ended on November 26 after a security operation, with several cases registered across Rawalpindi district.

Troops ‘physically handicapped’ by vast terrain

Insurgency background and wider fallout





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country’s security forces are “physically handicapped” by the sheer size of Balochistan as they battle a fresh surge in militant violence, after authorities reported killing 177 insurgents in sweeping counter-terror operations across the province.Addressing the national assembly, Asif described the scale of the challenge facing troops deployed in Pakistan’s largest and least populated province, where coordinated attacks triggered one of the deadliest security crises in recent years. His remarks came after militants launched simultaneous assaults in multiple towns, targeting civilians, homes and security installations.“Balochistan constitutes over 40 per cent of Pakistan geographically...To control it is much more difficult than a populated city, and it needs deployment of massive forces. Our troops are deployed there and are in action against them (terrorists), but they are physically handicapped by guarding and patrolling such a big area,” Asif told lawmakers, as quoted by PTI.Security officials said the death toll of militants had risen to 177 in the past two days following large-scale raids and gun battles.The operations were launched after insurgents carried out coordinated attacks at 12 locations, with authorities confirming that at least 17 police and security personnel were killed, along with dozens of civilians.Asif said the weekend violence claimed 33 civilian lives and 17 members of the security forces. He ruled out talks with the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), saying no negotiations would be held with “terrorists” responsible for killing civilians, including women and children.Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long faced a separatist insurgency driven by ethnic Baloch groups who accuse the central government of discrimination and exploitation. Authorities say groups such as the BLA have targeted security forces, infrastructure and projects linked to the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor.Train services between Balochistan and the rest of Pakistan remained suspended for a third day, while mobile and internet services were cut in several districts during clean-up operations. Provincial officials said services were expected to resume once the security situation stabilised.Asif dismissed claims that Balochistan had been neglected, saying the province had seen development, including multiple airports. He also rejected the “missing persons” narrative, alleging that names of militants killed in operations had appeared on such lists. “This narrative has been concocted. I also used to support this cause and protest over it. But, terrorists and criminal elements have hijacked all these narratives,” he said.","Khawaja Asif says security forces are 'physically handicapped' by sheer size of Balochistan.

They assaulted him before handing him over to a mob waiting outside the factory. The crowd attacked him with canes and rods amid religious sloganeering, hanged him from a tree at a nearby square and set him ablaze. The assailants also recorded and circulated videos of the attack.

Why Bangladesh's student-led NCP failed to replicate Assam's AGP moment of 1985,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/why-bangladeshs-student-uprising-failed-to-replicate-assams-agp-moment/articleshow/128300761.cms,"What happened in 1985 Assam assembly elections

Tarique Rahman set to become Bangladesh Prime Minister





In 1985, after leading a successful movement against illegal infiltration in Assam, the Asom Gana Parishad - born out of the All Assam Students’ Union - stormed the assembly elections, winning 65 seats in the 126-member House.Nearly four decades later, Bangladesh witnessed a seemingly similar moment. The National Citizen’s Party (NCP) emerged from the student-led uprising that forced Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from office in 2024. The protests, initially triggered by anger over civil service job quotas and intensified by outrage at police violence, quickly spread across Dhaka and beyond. According to the United Nations, up to 1,400 people were killed, most during the security crackdown ordered by Hasina.Unlike Assam’s student leaders in the 1985, the NCP failed to convert its moral authority into electoral success, managing to secure just 5 out of 299 seats.Despite the momentum of the uprising, the NCP faltered at the finishing line due to internal divisions, scarce resources, and weak grassroots networks.Signs of strain had already surfaced before polling day. The NCP’s decision to join an 11-party alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami triggered visible cracks within the party.Several women leaders resigned, alleging that they had been sidelined.The student movement was widely perceived as rooted in inclusive and democratic ideals, but partnering with the hardline Jamaat appears to have alienated segments of the NCP’s liberal voter base. Many of those voters are believed to have shifted towards Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).Following its defeat, the NCP accused authorities of “result tampering” and administrative manipulation. Party spokesperson Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain alleged at a late-night press conference that results were manipulated in constituencies including Dhaka-13, 15, 16, and 17.He claimed that in Dhaka-15, where Jamaat’s chief was reportedly leading by 20,000 votes, the BNP candidate was suddenly declared the winner without justification.The party has formally demanded recounts in multiple constituencies. However, beyond the allegations, the broader reality remains that the young leaders who once mobilised a powerful street movement now face the complex demands of electoral politics.For many within the NCP, the shift from agitation to governance has been disorienting. Some leaders took on advisory roles in the interim administration that followed Hasina’s exit, hoping to shape what one activist described as a “beautiful Bangladesh based on peace, equality, justice, and fairness.”The 1985 Assam assembly elections were historic as they followed the six-year Assam Agitation, a mass movement led by the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) against illegal immigration.After the Assam Accord was signed with the Centre in August 1985, AASU leaders transitioned into electoral politics by forming the Asom Gana Parishad.Riding on the momentum of the movement and widespread public support, AGP secured a landslide victory, winning 92 out of 126 seats.The result ended Congress’s dominance in the state and brought Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, a former student leader, to power as India’s youngest chief minister, making the election a landmark example of a protest movement successfully transforming into a governing force.With more than 151 seats in the 300-seat Parliament, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) swept the landmark parliamentary polls held on Thursday.Jamaat-e-Islami, leading an 11-party alliance, is heading for victories in around 75 seats, media reports said.BNP’s top leader Tarique Rahman is set to become Prime Minister, replacing the interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.","The National Citizen’s Party (NCP) emerged from the student-led uprising that forced Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from office in 2024. The NCP failed to convert its moral authority into electoral success, managing to secure just 5 out of 299 seats. The party accused authorities of ‘result tampering’ and administrative manipulation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128301124,imgsize-1612771,width-400,resizemode-4/128301124.jpg"
"Major row over Britain's Nato envoy Angus Lapsley bringing intern girlfriend, half his age, to official residence: 'They are not hiding it'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/major-row-over-britains-nato-envoy-angus-lapsley-bringing-intern-girlfriend-half-his-age-to-official-residence-they-are-not-hiding-it/articleshow/128274284.cms,"



Britain's ambassador to Nato, Angus Lapsley, has triggered a major diplomatic row after he brought his Italian girlfriend into his official residence in Brussels. The woman is nearly half her age and has been identified as Francesca Cortini, an intern, in reports. They met each other at Nato headquarters in Belgium. The couple has now set tongues wagging as insiders observed that they are not even trying to hide their relationship. The girlfriend was present at the residence for Christmas and summer receptions.The official residence, however, is not only meant for him.The lavist British residence in Belgium, a converted five-storey hotel, is also the address of two other Brotish ambassadors -- to Belgium and to the EU.The UK's incoming ambassador to the EU, Dame Caroline Wilson, who is yet to take charge and to shift to the address, said it was ""inappropriate"" for the pair to live together at the official residence.The relationship has been deemed so significant that Admiral Sir Keith Blount, Nato’s deputy supreme allied commander [in] Europe and the most senior British officer in the alliance, has reportedly been alerted.But the relationship won't cost Lapsley his pose as Nato policy does not prohibit a relationship between a senior official and a subordinate.Nato requires managers to declare any real or perceived conflict of interest and Lapsley made his bosses aware of the relationship that began after his separation from wife Gina.Lapsley, the father of two, is known for delinquency as he had his security clearance suspended in 2021 after he left top secret documents at a bus stop in Kent. The files had the locations of British special forces in Kabul.Lapsley also left behind at least one personal diary, which resulted in Ben Wallace, the defence secretary at the time, later calling for his security clearance to be reconsidered. Lapsley used the diary to express his frustration at the department and wrote about his relationships with individuals.The UK's incoming ambassador to the EU, Dame Caroline Wilson, said it was ""inappropriate"" for the pair to live together at the official residence.","Angus Lapsley has brought his Italian girlfriend into his official residence in Brussels.

British Indians have continually helped British economy prosper since WWII: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/british-indians-have-continually-helped-british-economy-prosper-since-wwii-report/articleshow/128273774.cms,"



LONDON: A white paper published by the Aston India Centre has shown how Indian migrants to the UK have repeatedly helped transform the British economy since World War II.Described as “one of the most consequential migration stories of modern Britain”, the paper, titled “Migration of the Indian Diaspora to the UK”, explores four waves of migrants from the 1940s post-war reconstruction to the post-2019 post-Brexit influx, showing how Indian migrants have strengthened Britain’s capacity to rebuild, adapt and prosper.It recommends the UK adopt a smarter migration strategy to align visa routes with employer demand, mutual qualification recognition with India, and for sector regulators in the UK and India to work together to verify credentials of workers and hold joint assessment clinics with employers to speed up recruitment and ensure the best people are hired.Written by the joint directors of Aston India Centre at Aston University, Prof Sangeeta Khorana and Prof Pawan Budhwar, as well as Manish Tiwari, chairman of Here&Now365, the report shows how Indian migrants have helped fill labour shortages since the 1940s. Until the 1970s there was no visa requirement for most Commonwealth citizens to move to the UK, and post-WWII the UK had many labour shortages which Indians came to fill, attracted by wage differentials and political upheaval back home.In 1972 a large number of Indians with British passports expelled from Uganda moved to the UK. More arrived via family reunion visas and set up businesses in places like Leicester and Birmingham.In the 1990s, Indians flowed to the UK to work in the services sector, especially IT, also transport, manufacturing and hospitality, attracted by the strong economy.Brexit in 2016 led to a loss of EU-origin workers in the UK. That, combined with policy liberalisation, led to a large influx of Indians as students, healthcare workers and skilled workers. Covid also triggered huge labour shortages in Britain. Indians are now the largest cohort on the skilled worker route and Indian migrants account for around 16% of all NHS professionals and 13% of the tech workforce.Since 2019 highly-skilled Indian migrants and entrepreneurs, specialists in AI, fintech, life sciences, advanced manufacturing and the digital sector, have established businesses and driven technological innovation not just in London, but in the regions as well. British Indians are now the wealthiest ethnic group in the UK by median net worth and have broadened Britain’s culinary traditions, music, film, literature and festivals. British Indians increasingly feature in public life, from local councils to being the PM, which helps social cohesion, the report said.Budhwar told TOI: “The white paper provides evidence-based analysis about the contribution of the Indian diaspora to the UK’s economy, culture and social capital. It highlights that the Indian diaspora are not a burden and are contributing significantly.”","White paper shows how Indian migrants to the UK have repeatedly helped transform the British economy since World War II.

British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe said on Thursday he was sorry that people took offence to his comments on immigration after he was criticised by Prime Minister Keir Starmer for saying the country had been ""colonised by immigrants"".""I am sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern, but it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth,"" Manchester United co-owner Ratcliffe said in a statement.“My comments were made while answering questions about UK policy at the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, where I was discussing the importance of economic growth, jobs, skills and manufacturing in the UK. My intention was to stress that governments must manage migration alongside investment in skills, industry and jobs so that long-term prosperity is shared by everyone. It is critical that we maintain an open debate on the challenges facing the UK,"" he added.Ratcliffe told Sky News on Wednesday: “You can’t have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in.“I mean, the UK is being colonised. It’s costing too much money.The UK has been colonised by immigrants.”PA understood the FA would also look at the comments to ascertain whether they breached its regulations, Independent reported.Should the FA choose to formally investigate, the probe may be focused on FA Rule E3.1, which covers general behaviour.The rule states: “A participant shall at all times act in the best interests of the game and shall not act in any manner which is improper or brings the game into disrepute or use any one, or a combination of, violent conduct, serious foul play, threatening, abusive, indecent or insulting words or behaviour.”Rule E3.2 states that a breach of Rule E3.1 would be considered an “aggravated breach” where it includes a reference, whether express or implied, to any one or more of the following – ethnic origin, colour, race, nationality, religion or belief, gender, gender reassignment, sexual orientation or disability.Ratcliffe, as a club co-owner, is subject to FA rules as a participant.Football anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out had already condemned the comments, saying in a statement issued to PA: “Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s comments are disgraceful and deeply divisive at a time when football does so much to bring communities together.“In addition to the inaccurate figures mentioned, it’s worth reminding him that Manchester United has a diverse fan base and plays in a city whose cultural history has been enriched by immigrants.“This type of language and leadership has no place in English football and we believe most fans will feel the same.”","British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe says he is sorry that people took offence to his comments on immigration.

How Manchester United supporter groups reacted



Why the irony is unavoidable



Bottom line







Sir Jim Ratcliffe set the cat among the pigeons. In a Sky News interview that veered from economics to identity, the Monaco-based billionaire and Manchester United co-owner claimed Britain had been “colonised by immigrants”, linking immigration to welfare dependency and national decline. The remarks triggered political condemnation, fan unease, and an uncomfortable reckoning with irony at one of the world’s most international football clubs.Speaking to Sky News, Sir Jim Ratcliffe laid out a single, continuous argument tying immigration, welfare and population growth together. This is the full passage that sparked the backlash:“You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in. I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money. The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it? I mean, the population of the UK was 58 million in 2020, now it's 70 million. That's 12 million people.”The structure matters. Immigration is presented as a fiscal drain, welfare as choice rather than circumstance, population growth as proof, and “colonised” as the conclusion that ties it all together.Ratcliffe is the founder of INEOS, Britain’s richest man, and the most influential figure in the leadership of Manchester United following his minority takeover. He is also resident in Monaco, a low-tax jurisdiction synonymous with elite mobility. The decision is legal, but it frames perception. When someone who does not pay UK income tax speaks about national economic burden, critics argue the argument cannot be separated from the privilege from which it is made.The controversy hardened because the numbers did not survive scrutiny.The UK population did not jump from 58 million to 70 million in the period implied. Britain reached roughly 58 million around the year 2000. By 2020, the population stood closer to 67 million, reaching around 70 million only years later. Compressing decades of demographic change into a single recent surge misrepresents reality.The welfare claim is equally misleading. While Britain has high benefit rolls, migrants are, on average, more likely to be in work than the UK-born population. The suggestion that immigrants are choosing benefits over employment is not borne out by available data.Prime Minister Keir Starmer described the remarks as offensive and wrong, saying Britain is a proud, tolerant and diverse country, and that Ratcliffe should apologise. The emphasis was on responsibility from public figures rather than suppressing debate.Broadcaster Piers Morgan responded directly on X: “Aside from his blatant lies/ignorance about UK population numbers, Ratcliffe is an immigrant tax exile in Monaco, and most of his Manchester United team are immigrants to UK. So he’s a stinking race-baiting hypocrite.”Far-right activist Tommy Robinson used the moment to argue selective outrage, claiming media and political anger over Ratcliffe eclipsed attention given to other scandals he prioritises.The sharpest discomfort came from within football.The Manchester United Supporters’ Trust (MUST) warned that such language risked alienating supporters and undermining the club’s inclusive identity, stressing that United’s past and present are inseparable from diversity and migration.The Manchester United Muslim Supporters’ Club said the rhetoric echoed language that has historically marginalised communities and could make fans feel unwelcome at a club they consider home.Football’s anti-racism body Kick It Out described the comments as divisive and inconsistent with values the sport has worked for decades to promote.None of these responses argued immigration policy should be beyond criticism. Their concern was about tone, symbolism and institutional responsibility.Manchester United is a product of migration. Its greatest teams were built by players born outside England. Its current squad spans continents. Its global revenues depend on fans far beyond Britain’s borders. Movement across borders is not incidental to the club’s success. It is foundational. For a co-owner of such an institution to describe immigration as “colonisation” is not just contradictory. It exposes a disconnect between the forces that create modern excellence and the narratives used to explain national anxiety.Manchester United’s history — and present — is inseparable from immigration. The modern club was rebooted by Eric Cantona, globalised by Cristiano Ronaldo, anchored by Peter Schmeichel, driven by the Irish-born leadership of Roy Keane, and defined in the Ferguson years by figures such as Nemanja Vidić, Patrice Evra and Edwin van der Sar. That reliance has not faded. The current side is built around Bruno Fernandes as its creative axis, with attacking thrust coming from Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. Remove immigrant players from Manchester United and you do not get a weaker version of the same club. You get a different club altogether — one stripped of the very forces that made it modern, competitive and global.What Ratcliffe articulated — clumsily, inaccurately, and provocatively — sits at the heart of Britain’s current immigration debate.For years, anxiety over immigration has been the single most potent political force reshaping the UK. It is the fuel behind the rise of Reform UK, the erosion of traditional party loyalties, and the sense among voters that elite institutions talk around the issue rather than about it. It is also why Keir Starmer, despite winning office, remains personally unpopular — caught between a base that wants moral clarity and an electorate that wants blunt answers.What makes Ratcliffe’s intervention significant is not its originality, but its source. When a billionaire industrialist, football owner, and establishment insider says out loud what was once confined to fringe politics, it signals that the Overton window has shifted. Language that would previously have ended careers now circulates in prime-time interviews.That does not make the claim correct. Ratcliffe’s numbers were wrong, his framing careless, and his metaphors loaded. But the reaction to his words — as much as the words themselves — reveals a country where immigration is no longer a question of policy detail, but of national self-understanding.In that sense, Ratcliffe did not start a new debate. He exposed how far the old one has already moved.","Sir Jim Ratcliffe claimed Britain had been ‘colonised by immigrants’ The remarks triggered political condemnation, fan unease, and an uncomfortable reckoning with irony at one of the world’s most international football clubs.

Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation into an “American-style” stabbing of two boys, aged 12 and 13, at Kingsbury High School in northwest London.Police were called at 12.40 pm local time on Tuesday to reports of a stabbing at the comprehensive secondary school in Kingsbury. Armed police were on the scene within 13 minutes of the call.“The suspect left the scene following the stabbing. After urgent enquiries our officers arrested him and also recovered a weapon which we believe to have been used in the stabbing. We are not currently looking for anyone else,” Detective Chief Superintendent Luke Williams said.A 13-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. He remains in custody where he is being questioned.Kingsbury is a multicultural area with a significant Indian ethnic population.According to local media, the arrested boy, a former pupil who had been expelled from the school for fighting, had climbed over the wall to enter the school and allegedly shouted “Allahu Akbar” as he stabbed two kids in a science lesson.He had come to target one of the boys “in revenge” and the other boy got stabbed because he set off the fire alarm. One boy was reportedly stabbed in the neck and the other in the stomach. Local media report the suspect had dressed in his old school uniform and sprayed the children and science teacher with pepper spray as he entered the classroom. Both injured boys remain in serious but stable condition in hospital. Their injuries are not life-threatening, police said. It has not been declared a terrorist incident.“At this very early stage, we are keeping an open mind as to any motivation behind this attack,” Williams added.The school went into lockdown and pupils were held in the playground. The attack has left parents and pupils petrified with some parents calling for metal detectors at the entrance.The academy school is for pupils aged 11 to 18. Its alumni include Wham’s George Michael and jazz musician Courtney Pine.","Two boys, aged 12 and 13, stabbed at Kingsbury High School in northwest London.

A question of branding or constitutional symbolism?

The history behind ‘His Majesty’





A political row has erupted in the United Kingdom after Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour government adopted a new logo bearing “UK Government” branding as the primary identity for public-facing communications, replacing the previously standard “HM Government”, short for “His Majesty’s Government”.The change came to light in response to a written parliamentary question, with the government confirming that references to “His Majesty” are no longer being used in its primary communications with the public.The move has drawn sharp criticism from the Opposition Conservatives, who allege it reflects a disregard for Britain’s constitutional traditions. The government, however, has defended the decision as a matter of clarity and consistency in public messaging.Under guidance updated after Labour took office in July 2024, official communications are now advised to use “UK Government” as the primary identity in public announcements and branding.Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said in response to a written parliamentary question that the change followed updated guidance reflecting the new Royal Coat of Arms after the accession of King Charles III.“A strategic decision has been made to adopt ‘UK Government’ as the primary identity for all public-facing communications,” he said.Previous Government Communications Service guidance under the Conservative administration had recommended the use of “HM Government” as the “recognised and trusted” master brand for official communications, unless there was a specific reason not to.A government spokesperson clarified that the change “does not affect the use of ‘His Majesty’s Government’, which continues on relevant official communications and records,” adding that the shift was intended to provide greater clarity for the public.Conservative leaders have strongly criticised the move, describing it as “disrespectful towards Britain’s history, culture, and constitutional settlement”.Alex Burghart, the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, accused Labour of attempting to “quietly obliterate tradition”.“What earthly good is caused by this change? It’s just another depressing attempt to modernise for modernisation’s sake. Be in no doubt: the Conservatives will reverse this on day one,” he said.Other Tory MPs argued that the term “His Majesty’s Government” reflects the constitutional principle that ministers serve the Crown, and that executive authority is exercised in the name of the monarch, not owned by politicians of the day.Henry Bolton, a former UKIP leader, went further, calling the change “constitutional vandalism” and alleging it formed part of a broader pattern, citing debates around jury trials and institutional reform.Supporters of the new branding argue that “UK Government” is clearer to the public and better reflects the government’s role as serving the country as a whole. Anti-monarchy campaigners have welcomed the move, saying it emphasises democratic accountability over royal symbolism.Critics, however, see the removal of “His Majesty” from public-facing communications as diluting the visible reminder that executive authority is constitutionally delegated by the Crown.At the heart of the controversy lies the symbolic weight of the phrase “His Majesty’s Government”.In the UK’s constitutional monarchy, the government formally derives its authority from the sovereign. Ministers are appointed by and serve in the name of the monarch, even though political power is exercised by elected representatives in Parliament.The term “HM Government” has long been used in official documentation, alongside institutions such as HM Treasury and HM Courts & Tribunals Service.The style “His Majesty” has deep historical roots. It was adopted by Henry VIII around 1519 to align the English crown with the grandeur of European monarchies such as that of the Holy Roman Emperor. Prior to that, English monarchs were commonly addressed as “Your Grace” or “Your Highness”.While the usage evolved gradually, “Majesty” became the established formal style during the reign of James I in the early 17th century. Over time, it became embedded in the legal and constitutional language of the British state.Today, the term is used for the reigning monarch, currently His Majesty King Charles III, who acceded to the throne on September 8, 2022, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II.He was crowned on May 6, 2023, and serves as King of the United Kingdom and 14 other Commonwealth realms, as well as Head of the Commonwealth.Phrases such as “His Majesty’s Government” and references in the national anthem, “God Save the King,” reflect the monarch’s constitutional position as head of state.This is not the first time Labour has faced criticism over changes to royal-linked terminology. During the New Labour years, institutions such as HM Stationery Office were rebranded, prompting similar debates about modernisation versus tradition.","Keir Starmer’s Labour government has adopted a new logo bearing ‘UK Government’ as the primary identity for public-facing communications.

A 13-year-old boy launched a stabbing attack at Kingsbury High School in Brent, north-west London, on Tuesday, leaving two pupils in a life-threatening condition in hospital as police investigated it as a suspected ideologically motivated incident.Witnesses said the teenager pulled out a knife in the middle of a classroom just before lunch and stabbed a 13-year-old boy in the neck and back while shouting ""Allahu Akbar."" Seconds later, a second boy aged 12 was stabbed in front of screaming children, Daily Mail reported.Armed police raced to the school, but the attacker fled. A suspect, who has not been named, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after being found hiding nearby around an hour later. Police said they also recovered a weapon believed to have been used in the stabbing.Sources said the suspect was not a pupil at Kingsbury High, raising questions about how he managed to get into the school building with a concealed weapon.Scotland Yard said counter-terrorism police were leading the investigation amid suspicions it was an ideologically motivated attack. Police have yet to formally declare that the stabbings were a terrorist attack as officers were still carrying out searches related to the suspect on Tuesday night.Many pupils who witnessed the attack were held in the school hall for several hours while police carried out inquiries.The father of one pupil said: 'He [the attacker] came into the school and my son saw him stab a child in the neck.""Two boys were on the floor and the other children thought they were just playing. But then they didn't get up. It's awful.""A woman said her sister was in the classroom next door when the attack started.She said: ""They heard screaming and crying. Our parents are travelling and they saw it on the news and were so worried. My brother was really scared to go back to school. How can you after a stabbing?""A father of another pupil added: ""My child is traumatised.""Maeve O'Callaghan-Harrington, who lives locally, said she heard children sobbing as they left school with their parents.She said: 'I walked outside and heard one boy saying, 'Mummy, Mummy, it was in his neck'.""Detective Chief Superintendent Luke Williams said police were 'keeping an open mind as to any motivation behind the attack'.He added: ""The suspect, who we believe to be 13, left the scene following the stabbing.

UK police on Tuesday arrested a teenage suspect after two boys were stabbed at a school in northwest London, with counter-terrorism officers taking charge of the probe amid concerns over the circumstances of the attack.The suspect, believed to be 13, was arrested several hours after fleeing Kingsbury High School, where the stabbing took place just after midday. Police said the boys, aged 12 and 13, were taken to hospital and were in serious condition. The suspected weapon has been recovered.“The suspect was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and remains in custody for questioning,” detective chief superintendent Luke Williams told reporters at the scene.He said police were keeping an open mind on the motive, adding that while the incident has not been declared a terrorist attack, counter-terrorism officers are leading the investigation. Police said they were not looking for any other suspects.Students were still being interviewed by officers hours after the school day ended, according to media reports.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said she was “heartbroken” by the incident and that her department was in touch with the school and local council to offer support.The stabbings come amid growing concern over teenage knife violence in the UK, particularly in London, and a rise in violent incidents in schools, according to teaching unions. Last week, a 15-year-old boy in Wales was remanded in custody after being charged with the attempted murder of a female teacher in a knife attack.The London Ambulance Service said two patients were treated, with one taken to hospital and the other to a major trauma centre as a priority.In a letter to parents, Kingsbury High School headteacher Alex Thomas described the incident as “deeply traumatic” for the school community, adding that the situation was under control. Some parts of the school, which has nearly 2,000 pupils aged 11 to 18, will remain closed on Wednesday.","Two boys, aged 12 and 13, stabbed at Kingsbury High School in northwest London.

A British woman was shot dead by her father at his home in Texas following an argument about Donald Trump and US politics, an inquest in the UK has heard.A UK court examined the death of 23-year-old Lucy Harrison, who was visiting her father in the United States with her boyfriend at the time of the shooting.Lucy Harrison had travelled to Texas from Warrington, Cheshire, with her partner, Sam Littler, to stay with her father, Kris Harrison, and his family at their home in Prosper, near Dallas.The shooting took place on January 10, 2025, only hours before the couple were due to return to the UK.Giving evidence, the boyfriend told the court that Lucy and her father often clashed, particularly over his ownership of a gun. On the morning of the incident, as the couple prepared to leave for the airport, a “big” argument broke out between father and daughter about Donald Trump, who was due to be inaugurated as US president for the second time.“Kris and Lucy ended up having quite a big argument which led to Lucy running upstairs and being upset,” Littler said.He told the court that during the dispute, Lucy asked her father how he would feel if she were sexually assaulted. According to the evidence, Harrison replied that he had two other daughters and it “would not upset him that much”.Littler said that around half an hour later, Harrison took his daughter by the hand and led her into his ground-floor bedroom.About 15 seconds later, he heard a loud bang, followed by Harrison shouting for his wife, Heather. When Littler entered the room, Lucy was lying on the floor near the bathroom doorway.Lucy died from a single gunshot wound to the chest. She worked as a fashion buyer for Boohoo and was described by her mother, Jane Coates, as a “real force of life” who cared deeply about social issues and enjoyed debate.The court heard that Harrison had previously received treatment for alcohol addiction. He did not attend the inquest, and his legal representative said the proceedings had been conducted more like a criminal investigation than a fact-finding hearing.Police in Prosper investigated the death as a possible case of manslaughter. However, a Collin County grand jury declined to indict Kris Harrison, and no criminal charges were brought in US.","Lucy Harrison, 23, was visiting her father in the United States with her boyfriend at the time of the shooting.

"Starmer's communications chief resigns, adding to UK PM's woes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/starmers-communications-chief-resigns-adding-to-uk-pms-woes/articleshow/128134605.cms,"Shocking! Starmer Faces Pressure From ‘Friends’ To Quit As Huge Epstein Storm Sweeps UK





LONDON: The director of communications for Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain resigned Monday, adding to a sense of crisis for the govt and growing questions about Starmer's leadership.The communications director, Tim Allan, a veteran political operative who only joined Starmer's govt about five months ago, quit less than 24 hours after Morgan McSweeney stepped down as the PM's chief of staff over ties between Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender, and Britain's former ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson.McSweeney resigned after acknowledging that he had urged Starmer to appoint Mandelson to the post in late 2024.Allan, a longtime friend of Mandelson who worked with him when Tony Blair was prime minister in the 1990s, said in a statement, ""I have decided to stand down to allow a new No. 10 team to be built. ""I wish the PM and his team every success,"" he added.The decision to appoint Mandelson is at the centre of a political crisis that threatens to bring down Starmer's premiership. Files released by the US justice department revealed that Mandelson and Epstein had a longer and closer friendship than was previously known.The documents appear to show when Mandelson was a member of govt in 2009, he sent confidential and market-sensitive information to Epstein, including an internal email sent to Gordon Brown, the prime minister at the time, outlining a potential sale of govt assets. ""Interesting note that's gone to the PM,"" Mandelson wrote.And in May 2010, the emails indicate, Mandelson gave Epstein advance notice that a bailout of 500 billion euros (about $600 billion) had been agreed to tackle the eurozone crisis. Epstein wrote, ""Sources tell me 500 b euro bailout, almost complte,"" misspelling the word complete. Mandelson replied, ""Sd be announced tonight.""Mandelson also sought advice from Epstein about setting up an advisory and consultancy firm and about how to attract clients, and the emails suggest Epstein made tens of thousands of dollars of payments to Mandelson.Critics and allies of Starmer have demanded to know what he knew about the relationship between the two men when he appointed Mandelson to the post. The PM has insisted Mandelson lied about the extent of his ties to Epstein. In a speech to his staff Monday morning, Starmer once again lashed out at the former ambassador.""The thing that makes me most angry is the undermining of the belief that politics can be a force for good and can change lives,"" Starmer said in a speech to staff at No. 10 Downing St., according to a readout from political aides of the closed-door speech.""I have been absolutely clear I regret the decision that I made to appoint Peter Mandelson,"" the PM added. ""And I've apologised to the victims, which is the right thing to do."" Starmer also vowed to continue working to carry out the agenda of Labour Party, which won an overwhelming majority 18 months ago, ending more than 14 years of government by the Conservative Party. Starmer's aides said at a briefing the PM did not intend to resign. ""We go forward from here,"" Starmer said in his speech to staff. ""We go with confidence as we continue changing the country."" nyt","PM Keir Starmer's communications director resigns. Tim Allan is a longtime friend of Peter Mandelson.

'The King has made clear': Buckingham Palace ready to back police probe into former Prince Andrew’s Epstein links,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/the-king-has-made-clear-buckingham-palace-ready-to-back-police-probe-into-former-prince-andrews-epstein-links/articleshow/128130035.cms,"King Charles Heckled Over Former Prince Andrew’s Epstein Ties During Essex Visit





Buckingham Palace has pledged to “stand ready to support” UK police if approached over allegations concerning King Charles III’s brother, former Prince Andrew.The King has expressed “profound concern” over claims that Andrew shared confidential reports from his role as the UK’s trade envoy with convicted sex offender and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Thames Valley Police confirmed it is assessing suggestions that Andrew disclosed sensitive information to Epstein, according to the Independent.A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The King has made clear, in words and through unprecedented actions, his profound concern at allegations which continue to come to light in respect of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s conduct. While the specific claims in question are for Mr Mountbatten-Windsor to address, if we are approached by Thames Valley Police we stand ready to support them as you would expect. As was previously stated, Their Majesties’ thoughts and sympathies have been, and remain with, the victims of any and all forms of abuse. ”The Palace has not yet been contacted by police regarding the claims, which relate to Andrew’s time as the UK’s special representative for international trade and investment. The allegations follow a US Department of Justice (DOJ) release of millions of documents linked to Epstein.The Prince and Princess of Wales addressed the scandal publicly for the first time, with Kensington Palace saying they were “deeply concerned” at the “continued revelations” and that their thoughts “remain focused on the victims.”Moreover, Andrew was stripped of his royal titles last year and has denied any wrongdoing. Last week, he moved from Royal Lodge to the King’s private Sandringham estate, with Charles personally funding his new residence through an annual stipend.The new allegations suggest Andrew shared confidential reports with Epstein, including briefings on visits to Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore. Emails show Andrew forwarded one report just five minutes after receiving it from his adviser, and another on Christmas Eve 2010 included details of investment opportunities in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province.The revelations have resulted in public criticism. Former BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said the King should make Andrew testify before the US Congress and back laws to remove him from the line of succession. He warned that if the King does not act, the monarchy could be seen as failing Epstein’s victims.The Epstein scandal has haunted the royal family in recent weeks, despite King Charles’s previous steps to end Andrew’s public life. Anti-monarchy campaigners were the ones who reported the allegations to the police in the first place.","Buckingham Palace has pledged to “stand ready to support” UK police if approached over allegations concerning King Charles III’s brother, former Prince Andrew.

Hamas Refuses To End Gaza Fight? Netanyahu Gets Chilling Warning | ‘3rd INTIFADA Would Break Out’





BETHLEHEM: Thousands of people flocked to Bethlehem’s Manger Square on Christmas Eve as families heralded a much-needed boost of holiday spirit. The giant Christmas tree that was absent during the Israel-Hamas war returned Wednesday, overlooking a parade of scouts playing songs on bagpipes.The city where Christians believe Jesus was born cancelled Christmas celebrations for the past two years. Manger Square had instead featured a nativity scene of baby Jesus surrounded by rubble and barbed wire in homage to the situation in Gaza. Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, top Catholic leader in the Holy Land, kicked off this year’s celebrations during the traditional procession from Jerusalem to Bethlehem, calling for “a Christmas full of light”.Arriving in Manger Square, Pizzaballa said he came bearing greetings from Gaza’s tiny Christian community, where he held a pre-Christmas Mass on Sunday. Among the devastation, he saw a desire to rebuild.“We, all together, we decide to be the light, and the light of Bethlehem is the light of the world,” he told thousands of people, Christian and Muslim.Despite the holiday cheer, the impact of the war in the Israeli-occupied West Bank is acute, especially in Bethlehem, where around 80% of the Muslim-majority city’s residents depend upon tourism-related businesses.The vast majority of people celebrating were residents, with a handful of foreigners. Some residents said they are starting to see signs of change as tourism slowly returns. “Today is a day of joy, a day of hope, beginning of the return of normal life here,” said Bethlehem resident Georgette Jackaman, a tour guide who has not worked in more than two years.A visitor from France, Mona Riewer, said “I came because I wanted to better understand what people in Palestine are going through, and you can sense people have been through a very hard time.” Fadi Zoughbi, who previously worked overseeing logistics for tour groups, said his children were ecstatic to see marching bands streaming through the streets.Irene Kirmiz, who grew up in Bethlehem and now lives in Ramallah, said the scout parade is among her favourite Christmas traditions. Her daughter, 15, plays the tenor drum with the Ramallah scouts. Her family had to wake up at 5am to arrive in time for the parade and waited upwards of three hours at Israeli checkpoints. “It’s very emotional seeing people trying to bounce back, trying to celebrate peace and love.”","Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, top Catholic leader in the Holy Land, kicked off this year’s celebrations during the traditional procession from Jerusalem to Bethlehem.

Osman Hadi's Brother Accuses Yunus Regime Of Murder Plot To Defer Bangladesh Polls Scheduled in Feb





DHAKA: Tarique Rahman, former PM Khaleda Zia’s son and BNP’s heir apparent, returns to Bangladesh Thursday along with his family, ending over 17 years of self-exile. On the eve of his return, the country’s largest political party described the moment as “both politically significant and emotionally charged. ”His return, along with wife Zubaida and daughter Zaima, comes less than two months before the parliamentary elections and BNP sources said his presence in campaigns as its star leader will help boost its prospects and its workers’ morale.BNP is facing the challenge of growing popularity of the coalition led by the country’s largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami, especially among the youth. To mark his return, BNP has organised a reception in the outskirts of Dhaka, for which the party expects thousands to gather.Rahman was detained by the 2007-2008 military-backed caretaker govt, and he went to Britain after the regime released him and has been living in London since then. He had faced multiple criminal convictions, including a case related to a plot to assassinate Hasina. He was, however, acquitted of all charges after Hasina’s removal.Though he has been leading the party from abroad, his return now comes as he prepares to take a more direct role in party affairs, sources said.","Tarique Rahman, former PM Khaleda Zia’s son, returns to Bangladesh along with his family, ending over 17 years of self-exile.

Putin Smirks As Zelensky Blinks, Offers Concessions To Moscow In New 20-Point Peace Plan





KYIV: President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine told reporters on Tuesday that he was ready to pull his troops back from areas of the eastern Donetsk region still under Kyiv’s control and turn them into a demilitarized zone as part of a possible peace deal with Moscow.The offer was the closest Zelensky has come to addressing the thorny territorial disputes in Donetsk that have repeatedly derailed peace talks, signalling his willingness to compromise after weeks of US-mediated negotiations.But the proposal also hinted at the significant gaps that remain between Ukraine and Russia. Zelensky’s offer of a demilitarized zone came with a condition: Russia would have to pull its forces from an equivalent stretch of land in Donetsk. So far, the Kremlin has given no indication that it is willing to accept anything less than full control over the region.The proposal forms part of a revised 20-point peace plan that was drawn up by Ukraine and the US in the past few weeks and that Zelensky presented to reporters in Kyiv on Tuesday. The blueprint covers a broad range of issues, from potential territorial arrangements to the security guarantees Ukraine wants to prevent future Russian aggression, as well as plans to rebuild the war-ravaged nation.Zelensky portrayed the plan as Ukraine’s best effort to end the war and said it was now up to Russia to decide how to respond.The Ukrainian leader said the various points in the plan “largely reflect the joint Ukrainian American position.” But Ukraine and Washington did not reach an agreement on two sticking points: the fate of Ukrainian-held territory in Donetsk and control of a major nuclear plant currently occupied by Russia. On the second point, Ukraine offered to manage the plant jointly with the US as a form of compromise.Ukraine’s proposed concessions, even if accepted in full by the US, are likely to be rejected by Moscow. The Kremlin has insisted that its primary goal is a full military takeover of Donetsk and has dismissed any notion of returning the nuclear plant to Ukrainian control.The Kremlin said President Putin had been briefed about the negotiations. “We aim to formulate our future stance and resume our contacts shortly,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday. Zelensky voiced cautious optimism that Moscow would not openly rebuff the new proposal for fear of angering President Trump.",Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky offered to pull his troops back from areas of the eastern Donetsk region still under Kyiv’s control as part of a possible peace deal with Moscow.

Yunus Govt Takes Responsibility Of Dipu Das Family After India Erupts Over Hindu Man's Lynching

Zia’s son was first to link Hadi’s killing to ‘conspiracy’





DHAKA: Slain anti-India activist Sharif Osman Hadi’s brother Omar has accused a section within the Muhammad Yunus-led interim Bangladesh govt of orchestrating the killing to derail the Feb 12 national election and warned of a Sheikh Hasina-like fate if Osman’s attackers are not tried quickly.“It is you who had Osman Hadi killed, and now you are trying to foil the election by using this as an issue,” Omar said. “You too will be compelled to flee Bangladesh one day if justice for Osman is not served. He always wanted the election to be held in Feb,” Omar said during a programme organised by Osman’s party Inqilab Moncho in Dhaka Tuesday.Ensure the trial of the killers quickly so that the election environment is not hindered, said Omar as he accused the govt of failing to present any visible progress before the people.Inqilab Moncho member secretary Abdullah Al Jaber reiterated the ultimatum of 30 working days given to the govt to identify and arrest the attackers. Till recently, a large section in Bangladesh pinned the blame for the assassination of Osman on New Delhi, leading to large-scale anti-India protests outside Indian high commission in Dhaka, and its assistant high commissions in Khulna, Rajshahi and Chittagong, where a stone-pelting mob precariously came close to the diplomat’s residence despite presence of Bangladeshi security personnel.Omar’s remarks are significant also because of the efforts the Yunus-led interim administration to align itself with his supporters. The govt flew the Islamic hardliner to Singapore for treatment for a critical gunshot injury to the head, arranged for a massive memorial service following his death on Dec 18 and allocated a grave beside the mausoleum of Bangladesh’s national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam.It was former PM Khaleda Zia’s son and BNP acting chairperson Tarique Rahman who had first linked the Osman’s killing to a “conspiracy to get the poll postponed”. As it happens, Tarique, who has been living in exile in the UK for over 17 years, is scheduled to reach Dhaka on Thursday.",Sharif Osman Hadi’s brother Omar has accused a section within the Muhammad Yunus-led interim Bangladesh govt of orchestrating the killing.

What the poll reveals about Trump and Powell



Trump trails despite strong Republican support



A long-running clash



Rates, policy and public moments





Jerome Powell has emerged as the most popular figure among senior US leaders, according to a new national survey. The finding places him ahead of President Donald Trump , whose approval rating remains near historic lows.The results come from a Gallup national poll conducted in early December 2025. The survey was carried out between December 1 and 15 and included roughly 1,000 US adults. It measured job approval for 13 major political and institutional figures.Gallup found that Powell holds a 44% job-approval rating, the highest of any figure tested in the survey. Trump’s approval rating stood at 36%, which Gallup described as a new low for his second term and only slightly above his all-time low of 34% recorded in 2021.Only two figures crossed the 40% threshold. Powell ranked first, followed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who registered a 41% approval rating. All other leaders included in the poll remained below that level.The survey shows that Trump’s approval remains sharply polarised along partisan lines. About 89% of Republicans approve of his performance, while support among independents is far lower and approval among Democrats is near zero.This divide continues to pull the president’s overall rating into the mid-30s.Powell’s numbers also reflect partisan division. While his 44% approval does not represent majority support, it remains the strongest net rating among all the figures tested in the poll.The result is notable given Trump’s repeated and public attacks on Powell throughout 2025. The president has criticised the Fed chair over interest-rate policy, called him a “loser,” and pressed the central bank to cut rates more aggressively to support economic growth.Trump has also suggested that Powell should resign and has openly weighed replacing him when his term as Fed chair ends in May 2026, despite having nominated Powell to the position during his first term.The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates three times this year as it seeks to support a slowing economy. The most recent cut, announced in December, lowered the benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points to a target range of 3.5% to 3.75%.Tensions between the two men have also played out publicly. In July, Powell corrected Trump during a visit to the Federal Reserve after the president misstated renovation costs at the Fed’s headquarters, an exchange that drew widespread attention.Gallup noted that no leader in the survey approached 50% approval, highlighting a broader mood of dissatisfaction with national leadership. The poll measures job approval rather than personal favourability or voting intent and reflects deep partisan divides across nearly all figures tested.","Gallup found that Powell holds a 44% job-approval rating, the highest of any figure tested in the survey.

Pennsylvania nursing home blast: Facility rated one star and ‘much below average’ in health inspections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pennsylvania-nursing-home-blast-facility-rated-one-star-and-much-below-average-in-health-inspections/articleshow/126150387.cms,"Deadly Blast Rocks Pennsylvania; Nursing Home Destroyed As Explosion Causes Multiple Casualties





The Silver Lake Nursing Home, the site of a devastating explosion on Tuesday, had an overall rating of one star on Medicare’s federal Care Compare system, indicating its health inspections are considered “much below average. ”The rating has raised questions about the facility’s safety and care standards, especially following the blast, which trapped many residents under debris. The explosion is suspected to have been caused by a gas leak, and numerous rescue teams were on site to assist.The Medicare star system evaluates nursing homes across three categories: health inspections, staffing, and quality measures. Silver Lake scores particularly poorly in health inspections, receiving only one star. Inspectors found multiple deficiencies in care and compliance with state and federal standards.The most recent health inspection in the nursing home took place in September 2024. The facility passed fire safety and emergency preparedness checks, the low inspection score suggests there were significant issues in resident care, medication management, or overall safety compliance. The poor ranking indicates that Silver Lake performs far below the national average for nursing homes of similar size and scope.Medicare’s five-star system is designed to help families and caregivers compare facilities when making decisions about care. A one-star rating, particularly in health inspections, signals potential risks to residents and areas in urgent need of improvement. The rating does not capture every aspect of care, but it shows significant concerns about regulatory compliance and day-to-day operations.The importance of rating comes into play after the nursing home suffered a major explosion, which trapped residents and forced emergency crews to conduct large-scale evacuations. The exact cause of the blast is still under investigation, but the facility’s low health inspection score has raised questions about its readiness for emergencies and its overall ability to protect residents.","Silver Lake Nursing Home had an overall rating of one star on Medicare’s federal Care Compare system.

UAE official weather alert

Daytime: Fair to partly cloudy skies most days.

Nighttime: Cooler with occasional fog or mist in inland and coastal areas.

Overall winds will stay light to moderate, occasionally becoming more active.

Rain forecast across UAE

Primary Zones: The islands and Northern Emirates are at the highest risk for rainfall.

Intensity: While most areas will see light drizzles, some northern regions may experience heavy downpours at times.

Duration: The cloud cover will persist until Sunday, December 29, meaning outdoor plans should include a backup indoor option.

Safety warning

Winter hits hard





The UAE is trading its sunny blue skies for a more atmospheric winter vibe this week.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), a weak extension of a low-pressure system is sweeping across the country from December 25 to December 29.This shift means residents can look forward to generally pleasant and moderate daytime temperatures, while the nights will take on a noticeably crisper, cooler edge.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) forecasts generally pleasant and moderate weather across the UAE from Thursday, Dec 25 through Monday, Dec 29. Temperatures will remain mild during the day and dip slightly at night, typical for the start of winter, as a weak low-pressure extension moves over the region.Expect scattered precipitation throughout the weekend. The NCM predicts that rainfall will be intermittent and vary in intensity, mostly appearing as light to moderate showers.Authorities are urging caution for commuters and mariners due to two major environmental hazards. High humidity levels will peak during the late night and early morning hours. This will likely result in thick mist and fog over inland and western areas.Drivers are advised to reduce speeds and follow police instructions on major highways.Sea conditions in the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman will remain manageable until Saturday. However, by Sunday, fresh northwesterly winds will cause the sea to become rough. Mariners and beachgoers should avoid deep-sea activities as the wind speeds increase.The UAE is currently experiencing its coldest week of the season. A weather station at Jebel Jais in Ras Al Khaimah recorded a bone-chilling 3.5°C at midnight recently, the lowest temperature of the year.As the rain clouds move in, daytime temperatures across the country will remain moderate, but nighttime temperatures will continue to dip significantly, especially in the desert and mountainous regions. If you are planning a desert camping trip this Christmas weekend, ensure you have heavy winter gear, as the humidity and wind will make it feel even colder than the recorded mercury.","A weak extension of a low-pressure system is sweeping across the country from December 25 to December 29.

From civil rights to clickbait: Dave Chappelle’s take on Charlie Kirk comparison with Martin Luther King Jr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-civil-rights-to-clickbait-dave-chappelles-take-on-charlie-kirk-comparison-with-martin-luther-king-jr/articleshow/126150455.cms,"Charlie Kirk's KILLER In Court; Tyler Robinson Defiant, Shows No Remorse | Dramatic Scenes On Cam





Comedian Dave Chappelle has forcefully rejected a comparison between conservative commentator Charlie Kirk and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr, calling the idea exaggerated and fundamentally misguided.In a clip circulating widely on social media, Chappelle responded to claims that Kirk represents a modern equivalent of Dr King. His verdict was blunt, arguing that the comparison stretches credibility far beyond breaking point.Chappelle dismissed the analogy almost immediately, saying that while both figures are well known, the similarities effectively end there. He acknowledged that both men have faced violence, but stressed that shared notoriety or controversy does not place them on the same moral or historical footing.According to Chappelle, equating a digital-era political influencer with a leader of a mass civil rights movement misunderstands what made Dr King significant. “That’s a reach,” he said, a phrase commonly used to describe an argument that is forced or unsupported by reality.At the heart of Chappelle’s critique was the difference between activism shaped by history and activism shaped by algorithms. He described Kirk primarily as an internet personality whose influence depends on provoking reactions and driving engagement online.Chappelle argued that modern online figures often rely on controversy to remain visible, because outrage fuels clicks, views and shares. That dynamic, he suggested, is fundamentally incompatible with the kind of leadership embodied by Dr King, whose work was rooted in grassroots organising, moral persuasion and sustained collective action.To underline the contrast, Chappelle jokingly imagined Dr King adopting the language of modern content creators, urging audiences to “subscribe” or “change my mind”, a comparison that drew laughter while reinforcing his point about the absurdity of the analogy.ID@undefinedCaption not available.The episode highlights a broader cultural tension over how historical legacies are invoked in today’s political debates. As social media blurs the line between activism, commentary and entertainment, comparisons to figures such as Martin Luther King Jr increasingly provoke backlash.For Chappelle, the line remains clear. Moral leadership forged in the struggle for civil rights, he suggests, cannot be reduced to viral moments or engagement metrics. In his view, moving “from civil rights to clickbait” is precisely where such comparisons go wrong.",Comedian Dave Chappelle has forcefully rejected a comparison between conservative commentator Charlie Kirk and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. He described Kirk primarily as an internet personality whose influence depends on provoking reactions and driving engagement online.

From snow-capped peaks to desert plains dusted in white, the Kingdom experienced a weather event that many had only imagined.A cold air mass sweeping across northern Saudi Arabia brought rain, strong winds, and record-low temperatures, creating ideal conditions for snowfall. In areas near Tabuk, including Jabal Al Lawz and the Trojena highlands, temperatures fell to around -4°C, allowing snow to settle at altitudes near 2,600 metres. Social media quickly filled with photos and videos showing the mountains blanketed in white, capturing the historic moment.Residents of Tabuk and Hail have embraced the rare weather, stepping outside to ski, play, and capture the snowy scenery. Videos shared online show adults enjoying skiing, children playing in the snow, and even camels wandering across snow-covered desert plains beneath dark, dramatic clouds, a surreal scene that quickly went viral.The snowfall turned parts of the Kingdom into an unexpected winter playground, blending the familiar desert landscapes with a temporary, magical layer of ice and snow.Alongside the snow, the cold wave brought widespread and persistent rainfall to several regions, reinforcing the impact of the inclement weather. For many, the combination of freezing temperatures, snow-capped mountains, and sudden, unexpected winter activities offered both excitement and disbelief, marking a rare and unforgettable moment in Saudi Arabia’s climate history.","Rare snowfall blankets Saudi Arabia for the first time in 30 years.

Why was the licence revoked?

What does this mean for you?

Knowing that the CBUAE is actively monitoring and ""pruning"" the market of non-compliant players means you can have higher confidence in the remaining licensed exchange houses.

These regulations are designed to prevent scams, fraud, and the misuse of financial platforms. A cleaner system means fewer risks for your personal hard-earned money.

By enforcing these rules, the UAE remains a globally respected financial hub. This keeps exchange rates competitive and ensures that international banks continue to work smoothly with UAE-based institutions.





The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has taken decisive action against Omda Exchange, revoking its licence and striking the company’s name off the official register of licensed entities. The regulator also imposed a financial penalty of Dh10 million on the foreign exchange firm. This enforcement follows supervisory examinations that uncovered multiple breaches of UAE banking laws and regulations.The move was carried out under the Decretal Federal Law on the Central Bank and the Organisation of Financial Institutions and Activities, which gives the CBUAE the authority to regulate, supervise, and enforce compliance across financial institutions operating in the country.According to official statements and regulatory findings, the CBUAE’s examinations revealed that Omda Exchange failed to comply with core legal and regulatory requirements. While specific details of each breach have not been fully disclosed publicly, the Central Bank’s action fits a broader pattern of strict enforcement against exchange houses that fall short of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and other compliance standards.The move underscores the bank’s mandate to ensure that financial service providers adhere to legal obligations and internal controls that safeguard the integrity of financial transactions in the UAE.You might wonder how a corporate fine affects the average resident sending money home. The impact is actually very positive for the ""common man.""

Epstein files out: Trump referenced in some newly released docs; DOJ calls claims 'untrue',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-accused-of-rape-in-newly-released-epstein-files-doj-calls-claims-untrue-and-sensationalist/articleshow/126148145.cms,"DOJ Epstein BOMBSHELL: Trump Did This On Jet With ‘Bestie’ & A Woman... | 11k More Files Released





The US Justice Department released nearly 30,000 additional pages of documents linked to Jeffrey Epstein, marking the largest disclosure yet in the long-running investigation into the late financier and convicted sex offender. The files also contained many of mentions of US President Donald Trump, although it includes an email from a prosecutor pointing out the flights that Trump took on Epstein’s private jet during the 1990s.The Department of Justice said that some material includes “untrue and sensationalist claims” about Trump that were submitted to the FBI shortly before the 2020 election. The department said those allegations were unfounded and false, but the records were being made public in the interests of legal transparency, with protections in place for Epstein’s victims.Among nearly 30,000 pages of material is now available on the official Justice Department website.An FBI intake report dated October 27, 2020, records a tip from a former limousine driver. According to that report, the driver described a disturbing phone conversation he claimed he overheard in 1995 involving Trump and Epstein.The driver’s account says the woman later told him she had contacted police about what had occurred, and was then found dead in January 2000 by suicide.The details in the file are heavily redacted, and the authorities have made little to no determination about the allegations’ credibility.In an accompanying statement on X on Tuesday, DOJ addressed the claims. It said some documents contain “untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election.""The authotrity described the allegations as lacking any credible basis. “To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponised against President Trump already,” the department said.The DOJ reitarated its commitment to transparency and the legal requirement to release the records, but also said that the inclusion of such claims in the files does not make them factual.Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In public statements this week, the MAGA chief called the focus on the Epstein case as a distraction by Democrats, asserting that he “cut ties” with Epstein long before the pedophile's arrest in 2019.The release covers a range of material, not just the unverified rape allegation. Internal emails in the files show Trump was recorded as having travelled on Epstein’s private jet in the 1990s more times than previously known — at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996.Trump’s association with Epstein in the 1990s is well documented, but inclusion in flight logs or social records is not itself an accusation of illegal behaviour.DOJ is constantly being pressured by Democrats for not releasing the full bulk of files. Supporters of the Transparency Act say the public has a right to see government records, even if they contain unverified claims.The latest release follows criticism of an earlier batch of Epstein records, some of which were temporarily removed from the DOJ’s online portal amid concerns about protecting victims’ identities. Authorities later restored those files after determining no victims were shown in the disputed photos.","Department of Justice released nearly 30,000 additional pages of documents linked to Jeffrey Epstein.

The US Department of Justice on Tuesday said that it has uncovered over a million additional documents “potentially related” to the Jeffrey Epstein case.In a social media post on X, the Department of Justice said that finishing the release of all of Epstein’s files could take a “few more weeks.”“The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI have informed the Department of Justice that they have uncovered over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The DOJ has received these documents from SDNY and the FBI to review them for release, in compliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, existing statutes, and judicial orders,” the DOJ said.“We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible. Due to the massive volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks. The Department will continue to fully comply with federal law and President Trump’s direction to release the files,” it added.This comes days after the DOJ released 30,000 more pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, while noting that some of these documents contain “untrue” claims made against President Donald Trump.In an X post, the DOJ claimed that the documents against Donald Trump are “false” and would have been “weaponised” against him.“The Department of Justice has officially released nearly 30,000 more pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein.

Nevertheless, out of our commitment to the law and transparency, the DOJ is releasing these documents with the legally required protections for Epstein’s victims,” the DOJ wrote on X.A 2021 subpoena to the Mar-a-Lago Club, founded by Trump in 1995, is also among the documents, as reported by CNN. The subpoena relates to a probe into Epstein’s former girlfriend and convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell The documents also include a letter signed by “J Epstein,” which was sent to convicted sex offender Larry Nassar in the same month Epstein died by suicide in 2019. The letter, as reported by CNN, makes references to Trump without explicitly naming him. The letter contains the phrase “our president.”However, the DOJ said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has confirmed that the letter is fake. The DOJ noted that the writing in the letter does not appear to match Epstein’s, and the letter was postmarked three days after his death.The US passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act last month, prompting the DOJ to release documents related to Epstein, who was charged as a sex offender.Newly released documents tied to Epstein have put a spotlight on previously unseen photos of the late convicted sex offender with a host of high-profile figures, including legendary popstar Michael Jackson, musician Mick Jagger, and former US President Bill Clinton.The DOJ has released thousands of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, but a substantial number of documents remain unpublished.Among the newly released documents is a grand jury interview with an unnamed FBI agent from May 2007. The agent described an allegation that Epstein recruited a 15-year-old girl to give him a topless massage.The agent said a witness had recruited other girls from among their peer group, adding: “Epstein liked girls like her, which is thin and blonde and attractive,” as quoted by The Independent.Another witness quoted in the files described Epstein as selective and highly focused on the age of the girls he allowed to work for him, adding that Epstein rejected some girls he “didn’t really like” and once dismissed a potential masseur as “too old” at 23.","The US Department of Justice on Tuesday said that it has uncovered over a million additional documents “potentially related” to the Jeffrey Epstein case.

Nick Fuentes declared war on Indian-origin people as he announced Tuesday he would campaign against Vivek Ramaswamy ahead of the 2026 Ohio Governor election so that Vice President JD Vance gets a message before he runs for the president in 2028. Nick Fuentes targeted Vivek Ramaswamy because of his Indian origin after Ramaswamy called out Nick in his NYT op-ed and said Nick Fuentes does not represent what America stands for. JD Vance became Nick Fuentes' target as JD Vance too objected to Fuentes' racist slur against Second Lady Usha Vance.27-year-old Nick Fuentes is a high-profile far-right American political commentator and activist, best known for promoting extremist and white nationalist views and leading a loosely organized online movement called the Groypers. Fuentes was not considered mainstream as his ideologies are considered dangerous for America but he started becoming mainstream after he was interviewed by MAGA's own Tucker Carlson.Fuentes recently used a racial slur against Usha Vance because of her Indian origin which is now at the center of the major MAGA implosion. After Vivek Ramaswamy called Nick Fuentes out, JD Vance too said anyone who attacks his wife can eat s**t.This made both JD and Vivek Ramaswamy the targets of Nick Fuentes as he equated both of them by their Indian connection and said that to defeat JD Vance in 2028, Vivek Ramaswamy should be defeated first in 2026.""I think I’m going to go to Ohio and the word that we are looking for is denial.

Kash Patel-Led FBI Hands Over 1 MILLION More Files To Trump DOJ





In academia, loyalty is usually reserved for ideas, not indicted billionaires. But newly surfaced emails suggest a UCLA neuroscience professor once pledged allegiance to Jeffrey Epstein — even after learning the disgraced financier was preparing to plead guilty to soliciting a minor. Calling themselves “boys from The Bronx,” the professor framed friendship as thicker than scandal, law enforcement or, it seems, common sense.Newly unearthed emails showed that Professor Mark Tramo of UCLA pledged loyalty to Jeffrey Epstein after learning he planned to plead guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor. The message, sent after Tramo read media reports of the impending plea, referred to them as “boys from The Bronx”, emphasising their bond, New York Post reported.“I read the newspapers this morning. … Please remind him that boys from The Bronx (even if they end up at Harvard) have long memories, know all about cops, and stay true to their friends through thick and thin (no less peccadilloes),” Tramo wrote.Epstein served a 13-month sentence for the solicitation charges. He was also charged with sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors in July 2019 and died in jail two months later.In a statement to the Harvard Crimson, Tramo denied knowing the full extent of Epstein’s conduct in 2006–2007, saying he had been “duped to believe” the offences were minor. He added, “I never visited Epstein’s island, never flew on his planes, and never saw him with young girls.”In a 2018 email, Tramo offered to analyse Kanye West’s meeting with President Trump for Epstein “given your interest in creativity”. Records suggest the Institute for Music and Brain Science, founded by Tramo, received grants from the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation between 2010 and 2012. A UCLA spokesperson told the Daily Bruin the university had no records of gifts from that foundation.Student reactions were mixed. “You can’t say that you didn’t know what was going on if then you’re still contacting him past his initial arrest,” one student said on condition of anonymity. Grace Wang, who took Tramo’s class in fall 2025, said the emails did not indicate a close connection to Epstein, adding that the professor seemed inclined to email anyone “of even remote interest to him.”The trove of documents was released by the Department of Justice under a bipartisan mandate and includes FBI files, court records and photographs, though large sections remain heavily redacted to protect victims. In a letter to lawmakers, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said teams of attorneys had reviewed hundreds of thousands of pages of material to determine what could legally be disclosed. More Epstein-related material is expected in the coming weeks.","Newly unearthed emails showed Professor Mark Tramo of UCLA pledged loyalty to Jeffrey Epstein after learning he planned to plead guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor.

Epstein In Senate: Kash Patel Ambushes Massie; 'You Want Names, You Want Names?' | FULL EXCHANGE





When the Epstein files hit X, the blowback hit harder. Now, in an unusual damage-control move, the White House has taken charge of the Justice Department’s social media messaging, trying to steady the narrative after a chaotic release, sudden deletions, and a wave of conspiracy theories rattled the Trump administration.According to Axios, the department of justice (DOJ), under Attorney General Pam Bondi, has been working through a reported trove of over 1.45 million records to meet the requirements of the Epstein Transparency Act, personally signed by President Trump. Faced with criticism, White House officials assumed control of the account to sharpen messaging and steer away from the negative public reaction.One day after posting the first batch of documents, the DOJ reclaimed 13 files without explanation. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee asked Bondi on X, “What else is being covered up?” Bondi is facing calls for impeachment and contempt of Congress over her handling of the files.One retracted file featured a photograph of Trump, 79, found in a drawer at an Epstein property. The DOJ said it removed the image out of concern for victims before reinstating it following further review.An unnamed official told Axios that a second batch of files - in which the president features more prominently - was released prematurely owing to an internal error.Officials close to the administration voiced frustration: “It’s a combination of extreme frustration at everything: at what Congress did, at our response to it, and a concern that it won’t go away.”Bondi’s department was also criticised for not releasing all records by the Friday deadline, as required by law. More than 200 staff worked through the backlog, but puzzling redactions have undermined the pledge of full transparency.In one case, the publicly available addresses of the United States Attorney’s Office and the New Mexico Department of Justice were removed from a 2020 letter about the seizure of an Epstein property. “These redactions are so arbitrary, it destroys the credibility of the entire exercise,” journalist Michael Tracey wrote on X. “They’re redacting completely banal documents that have already been in the public domain for years!”A reporter from the Miami Herald noticed another 2008 document that was unjustifiably redacted under the Transparency Act.Critics have also pointed to the quality of the documents released. After issuing 30,000 new investigative records on Tuesday, the DOJ included an alleged letter from Epstein to convicted sex offender Larry Nassar in which “our president” liked “nubile” girls. The letter was postmarked after Epstein’s death and passed through a mail room that did not handle correspondence from Epstein’s New York jail, and it was later determined to be a fake. The department released it anyway in the interest of “transparency.”The DOJ later posted on X, “The FBI has confirmed this alleged letter from Jeffrey Epstein to Larry Nassar is FAKE,” prompting concerns over the release of disinformation.On Tuesday, another questionable document slipped through vetting even as the department warned some records could be “untrue and sensationalist” but insisted on issuing them for “transparency.”Although no “smoking gun” has been found linking President Trump to wrongdoing, he remains rattled by mentions of his name in the files. “The minute he thinks it’s unfair to him and it’s a personal attack, he just goes into fight mode,” an insider told Axios in November.Around 700,000 files still await review, prolonging the scrutiny of the Trump administration. “This will end soon,” one official said. “The conspiracy theories won’t.”","The White House has taken charge of the Justice Department’s social media messaging, trying to steady the narrative after a chaotic release, sudden deletions, and a wave of conspiracy theories.

The highly contagious norovirus is spreading rapidly across the country as the year comes to a close, driven by a surging variant. This new wave of norovirus outbreaks coincides with nationwide spikes in flu, whooping cough, measles, and COVID.Sickness from norovirus, often referred to as the ""winter vomiting disease"" or ""winter vomiting bug,"" could require medical attention or even hospitalisation for immunocompromised people, the elderly and children, Axios reported.Cases of norovirus have picked up in California in recent weeks as a new subvariant, GII.17, has triggered a spike, according to the Los Angeles Times. The San Francisco and Los Angeles areas saw massive climbs in cases. Michigan, New Jersey and North Carolina have also reported upticks, while Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Alabama, Montana and Wyoming have seen rising case numbers, per data from Epic Research.For the week ending on Dec. 9, the national positivity rate was 9.9%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It climbed to 12.11% for the week ending on Dec. 13.Norovirus is a contagious disease that causes inflammation of the stomach and intestines, leading to extreme cases of vomiting and diarrhoea, per the CDC.It is one of the top causes of vomiting and diarrhoea and has gained the nickname ""extreme vomiting disease.""Roughly 20 million people contract norovirus every year in the US, per Scientific American. Outbreaks attributed to GII.17 rose from 7.5% during the 2022–23 season to 75.4% in the 2024–25 season, according to CDC data. In the same period, outbreaks of the previous leading variant, GII.4, fell from nearly 49% to 10.7%.Two other major illnesses are still circulating during the holiday season. COVID cases are surging nationwide, with 31 states reporting infections that are growing or likely growing, many driven by the XFG Stratus variant. Experts have also warned of a new flu outbreak in Europe, caused by a version of H3N2 that emerged over the summer.Symptoms of norovirus typically begin 12 to 48 hours after infection and include diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, stomach pain and dehydration. Fever or body aches are possible but remain uncommon.There is no specific treatment for norovirus, but symptoms generally resolve within one to three days, per the Cleveland Clinic. Health officials recommend drinking liquids and electrolytes, eating bland foods, washing hands thoroughly and disinfecting surfaces. Hand sanitiser alone is ineffective, and anyone who catches norovirus may wish to avoid preparing food for a few days to limit the spread.","Cases of norovirus have picked up in California in recent weeks as a new subvariant, GII.17, has triggered a spike.

Advice for other applicants





The US State Department has quietly expanded its social media screening requirements for skilled-worker visas, a move that is now beginning to affect applicants on the ground. As of December 15, the enhanced vetting process applies to H-1B visa holders as well as their H-4 dependents, a shift that was not widely publicized but has since led to delays, passport retention, and temporary refusals pending administrative review.Amid the uncertainty surrounding H-1B processing, an applicant from India has shared their recent experience online, noting that emergency visa requests are currently being approved. The individual posted details on Reddit to help others better understand what to expect under the updated screening process.According to the Reddit post, the applicant arrived at the US Consulate in Chennai on Monday, December 15, at 9:30 am. “Reached the consulate around 8:45 AM and was let in without having to wait. First, there was a queue for fingerprint verification.

Kamala Harris’s dating advice

Netizens react to Kamala Harris’ dating advice

Kamala Harris on being a ‘humble’ woman





For the time being as she takes a sabbatical from politics, Democrat leader Kamala Harris seems to be making a career move towards a dating coach. The former Vice President has been making quite the headlines on the dating advice she has for young girls and rather than making it easier for them, it seems she has them confused.On Tuesday, Harris appeared on the “Rich Little Broke Girls” podcast and shared amusing dating advice with her signature cackle. According to her, you can have all you want whenever you want.Harris, 61, who married Douglas Emhoff in 2014 had something really interesting to say to all the young and single woman dating out there. “Choose to be with someone who allows you to laugh at yourself and them,” said Harris. “Choose to be with someone who you know you like, going to the grocery store together, taking a walk together.”Up till here, her advice seemed like one from a wise woman who has experienced both dating and marriage. But soon, the tables turned. Harris also stated that there are “different phases in your life and you may not know what phase you’re in.”“Maybe you’re going to choose that you want to have that kind of Friday night relationship — or you want that Sunday morning relationship,” she continued. “Sometimes you can get both — and sometimes they just is oil and water.And that’s OK! Be in those phases where you are having fun!” she added.“Enjoy dating, by the way, because dating is fun. It’s supposed to be. Just do what, at the end of the day, when you go to sleep at night and when you wake up in the morning, makes you feel like, ‘I’m good,’” she suggested.While she met and married her husband in their 40s, she added that she couldn’t tell if they “would have really been in the same place” if they had met in their 20s.People on the internet are less than impressed with Harris’s dating advice. As a former Vice President and presidential candidate, it seems the expectations for her were high. Americans wanted a wise and profound advice from her, but what they got was a casual dating tip. And it has left them enraged, considering it is coming from an experienced politician.“Nothing profound, but she acts like it's deep wisdom. Hard to believe this woman ran for president. But hey, Dems—please nominate her again in 2028. I’m begging you,” said a post on X.“Sounds like a cyclical recipe for insecurity and constant self-questioning of one's worth, based on sexuality's power dynamics. Figuring this out on your own is one thing; having a political leader say it is another,” pointed out another.“Was this career advancement or relationship advice? Can never tell with that one...,” trolled another referring to Harris’ past relationship with Willie Brown.“Honestly, the advice itself isn’t that crazy. She’s basically saying different people serve different roles in different seasons of life, and that it’s okay to be honest about what you want at the time. Some people will hear this as empowering, others will see it as unserious coming from a politician,” explained an X user.Elsewhere in the interview, Harris recalled a reporter asking her about criticisms of her lack of humility. ""I don’t aspire to be humble. Humility, yes, is very important. [It’s] a very dated perspective on who women should be. To say that women should be humble. Women should be quiet. Women should laugh quietly,"" she said.""Women should not have a sense of humour. Women should not raise their voice,"" she continued. ""I have never felt burdened by those very dated, and I think out-of-touch standards.""In an April 2024 interview with Drew Barrymore , she also addressed the criticism she faced on her signature cackle. ""Well, let me just tell you something: I have my mother’s laugh,"" she continued. ""And I grew up around a bunch of women, in particular, who laughed from the belly.""While the netizens are expecting something sage from the politician all the time, sometimes one can be just an honest woman and share a tip that is ideal for a modern woman. Not everything around a politician needs to be politicised. Additionally, there were others on the internet who also found her dating advice ideal, writing comments such as, “Dating advice from Kamala Harris is something I never knew I needed but love to have. ”","Kamala Harris appeared on the “Rich Little Broke Girls’ podcast and shared amusing dating advice with her signature cackle.

"New H-1B rules won't make much difference if $100,000 fee remains, Indian-origin immigration attorney explains why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-h-1b-rules-wont-make-much-difference-if-100000-fee-remains-indian-origin-immigration-attorney-explains-why/articleshow/126162474.cms,"U.S. Rewrites H-1B Rules, Setback To Indian Workers; Check Who Is Eligible & Changes | WATCH

Four wage levels

But $100k fee...





Though the new H-1B rules, based on wage, will do away with the existing random lottery, it will not make much difference if the proposed fee of $100,000 remains, as companies will still think twice before hiring H-1Bs who now have a better chance of getting a higher wage in the new rules. Indian-origin attorney Rahul Reddy said this wage-based model assumes steady participation across wage levels and locations but the assumption becomes less reliable when combined with a proposed $100,000 fillinf fee for H-1B cases initiated from outside the US.""Even if a role qualifies for a higher wage level and stronger lottery odds, the cost of entry changes employer behavior. At some point, employers stop asking what their chances are and start asking whether filing makes sense at all. Higher odds do not matter if demand falls. If overseas filings decline sharply, the pool shrinks, and projected selection percentages may no longer reflect real-world outcomes,"" Rahul Reddy said.Level I wage generally reflects entry-level roles with limited experience and supervision. Under the weighted system, a Level I registration enters the lottery once. A Level II wage, representing more experience and independent work, enters the pool twice.Level III wages, typically for advanced or specialized roles, enter three times. Level IV wages, associated with senior, highly skilled positions, enter the lottery four times.Each beneficiary is still counted only once toward the annual cap, but the number of entries affects the odds. So estimated chances of selection rise materially with wage level. Level IV roles may see selection probabilities exceeding 60 percent, Level III around the mid-40 percent range, while Level I roles experience a much lower likelihood. The lottery still involves chance, but it is no longer blind. When odds are multiplied, randomness gives way to weighting.""This wage-based model assumes steady participation across wage levels and locations.

Pak PM Sharif's Party Leader Threatens India, Warns Missiles Will Respond If Bangladesh Is Targeted





In a sharp attack on Pakistan’s security establishment, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations. Speaking at a recent gathering in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the influential Deobandi cleric questioned the logical consistency of Pakistan’s defence policy, specifically contrasting Islamabad’s recent strikes in Afghanistan with its diplomatic outrage over Indian activities within Pakistani borders.He asked Pakistan’s military brass why India’s actions inside Pakistan should be condemned when Islamabad justifies strikes in Afghanistan by calling them attacks on its enemies. Rehman argued that if Pakistan claimed a sovereign right to launch pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes against perceived enemies on Afghan soil, it weakened its moral and legal standing when protesting similar actions by India. “We sent militants to Afghanistan for 20 years. .. from giving them Kalashnikovs to Cruise missiles... we empowered them in every way. When you bombed Kabul, it was as if someone had bombed your Islamabad.This is the limit, isn’t it? If you had bombed the remote areas, you might have been able to tolerate it. So, you took some action there as well...”“...If you say, and I have questions, that we have attacked the enemy’s headquarters and you call this a legitimate statement, India says to you that it has attacked Bahawalpur, it has attacked Muridke, it has attacked the headquarters of those who are operating against us in Kashmir. Why are you objecting to this? And if you object to this, and if you have the same claims against Afghanistan, how will you justify it..?”Rehman’s criticism comes at a time when Pakistan’s Field Marshal Asim Munir continues his anti-India rhetoric and claims that Pakistan received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May which was felt during the days of intense fighting that followed Indian strikes on terror targets.Rehman’s comments touch upon a sensitive nerve in geopolitics, specifically referring to locations like Bahawalpur and Muridke — areas long identified as hubs for terrorist groups like JeM and LeT — which were decimated during Operation Sindoor. By asking, “Why different rules for India?” Rehman highlighted the strategic hypocrisy: justification of “counterterrorism strikes” in the west, while demanding absolute territorial sanctity in the east.",Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations.

""Political strength is not the right of defence institutions; it belongs to the people and politicians,"" Rehman said.Rehman further said national progress depended on constitutional supremacy, not the dominance of one institution over others. The senior cleric-politician also opposed sending Pakistani troops to Palestine.On Afghanistan, Fazlur Rehman noted that no Afghan government, from the time of King Zahir Shah to Ashraf Ghani, had been friendly towards Pakistan, and asked whether this pointed to failures in Pakistan’s own policy.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s chief of defence forces field marshal Asim Munir has claimed that Islamabad received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May, while also asking Afghanistan’s Taliban regime to choose between Pakistan and the Tehrik i Taliban Pakistan, PTI reported.Addressing the National Ulema Conference in Islamabad, Munir in a widely circulated video said Pakistan’s armed forces experienced “divine intervention” during the four day conflict triggered after India launched Operation Sindoor. “We felt it,” he said.India carried out Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians. The strikes led to intense clashes between the two countries for four days and ended with an understanding to halt military actions on May 10.Meanwhile, Munir warned the Afghan Taliban to choose between Pakistan and the TTP, saying Afghan nationals form the majority of militants infiltrating across the border. “In the TTP formations coming [into Pakistan], 70 per cent are Afghans,” he said. “Is Afghanistan not spilling the blood of our Pakistani children?” He reiterated that Kabul must decide between Pakistan and the TTP.The Field Marshal also said that no one could declare jihad in an Islamic state except the state itself. “No one can issue a fatwa for jihad without the order and permission and will of those vested with the authority,” he said.Munir also drew parallels between Pakistan and the state established by the Prophet 1,400 years ago in the Arab region, now Saudi Arabia.He said that among the world’s 57 Islamic countries, “God gave us the honour of being the protectors of Haramain Sharifain,” referring to Makkah and Madina.Official details of the December 10 address were limited, with selected clips aired later by Pakistani media.","Pakistan’s chief of defence forces field marshal Asim Munir has claimed that Islamabad received ‘divine help’ during the military confrontation with India in May.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently incarcerated for now over two years, on Saturday called on his supporters to prepare for nationwide protests and announced his intention to challenge the recent Toshakhana-II verdict, which he alleged was delivered in “haste” by the Islamabad high court. Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.He also alleged that Pakistan is being governed by solely under ""Asim law.""With no access to his social media accounts, Khan conveyed his message through his legal team. According to a post on X summarising a conversation between the PTI founder and his lawyer, Khan instructed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi to begin preparations for a mass street movement.In the detailed message shared by his team, Khan said: “To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. At this moment, Pakistan is being governed solely under ‘Asim Law’. Here, verdicts are pre-written and merely announced aloud. Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the past three years, the Toshakhana 2 verdict is nothing new for me. This ruling, too, was delivered in haste, without any evidence and without fulfilling legal requirements.Neither we nor our lawyers were even given opportunity to present our case.”He alleged that both he and Bushra Bibi were being subjected to harsh solitary confinement. “The sustained solitary confinement imposed on me and my wife constitutes severe mental torture. We are barred from books, television, and meetings… The books sent by my family are confiscated by jail authorities, and we are kept in solitary confinement for weeks at a time. This treatment is inhumane, yet all this oppression and brutality cannot weaken my resolve. ”Khan also accused the authorities of persecuting women linked to PTI. “It is not our tradition to target women and children… I am deeply saddened and distressed by the mistreatment and brutality faced by my sisters and other women outside Adiala Jail. The treatment meted out to Bushra Bibi, Dr. Yasmin, Mahrang Baloch, and other women stands in clear violation of Islamic traditions and moral values.”The former prime minister again directed his criticism at army chief Asim Munir . “The army is mine and belongs to the people of Pakistan. When I criticise Asim Munir, it is criticism of an individual… Whatever is happening to me in jail is being carried out on the instructions of a colonel acting under Asim Munir’s orders.”Urging the legal fraternity to mobilise, Khan said: “For the struggle to restore the rule of law and uphold the Constitution, it is essential for the Insaf Lawyers Forum and legal fraternity to step forward decisively.”He added that he had instructed his legal team to appeal the verdict: “I have full confidence in Salman Safdar and his team and have instructed them to file an appeal against these bogus decisions in the Islamabad high court.” Concluding his message, he said: “My message for Sohail Afridi is to prepare for a street movement. The entire nation must rise for their rights!! To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. ”The message was signed off as: “Illegally Incarcerated Former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, speaking to his lawyers after the verdict of a military-style trial in Adiala Jail.”In an official statement, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) described the verdict as “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal, malicious and the worst form of political revenge and a textbook case of victimisation.”The party-led by Imran Khan alleged that the conviction aimed to prolong Khan’s imprisonment and ease pressure on what it called a “petrified ruling clique,” claiming political vendetta was being executed through a “subservient” judiciary.Addressing a press conference alongside senior party leader Asad Qaiser, PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja said Khan had met his lead counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, in the courtroom and shared a message for the nation. He quoted Khan as saying, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.”Raja added that the case lacked substantive evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said.Heavy police deployment was enforced across Rawalpindi, with more than 1,300 police officers and security personnel stationed at key locations to maintain law and order, after former Imran Khan called for the nationwide protests.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.

Water crisis deepens public health risks





At least two women were killed and several others injured in Balochistan’s Noshki district after a passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck, Dawn reported. The vehicle was travelling from Quetta to Chagai when the crash occurred near the Sher Jan Agha area.Five passengers sustained injuries, with two shifted to Quetta for critical care. Hospital officials said at least eight people hurt in rain-related incidents were brought to the Civil Hospital.The rainfall, which began on Saturday, ended a prolonged dry spell in the Quetta valley, offering brief relief to drought-hit farmers. However, it also caused widespread disruption. Despite forecasts ruling out significant rainfall, showers intensified by noon, flooding roads, halting traffic and plunging large parts of Quetta into darkness after electricity supplies were suspended. Mobile networks were also disrupted, leaving residents without communication for hours.Low-lying neighbourhoods, particularly areas with mud houses and weak construction, were badly affected as rainwater entered homes.Heavy rainfall was reported across several districts, including Ziarat, Pishin, Kalat, Zhob, Mastung and Sibi, with power outages lasting for hours in many areas.Meanwhile, experts warned that Pakistan’s water-quality crisis is worsening. Speaking at a seminar organised by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) in Islamabad, specialists said only 47 per cent of the population has access to safe drinking water, according to The Express Tribune.Dr Hifza Rasheed of the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources said per capita freshwater availability has dropped from 5,260 cubic metres in 1951 to below 1,000 cubic metres in 2024, placing Pakistan among water-scarce nations. Unsafe water, experts said, accounts for nearly 40 per cent of illnesses nationwide and contributes to tens of thousands of child deaths each year.","A passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck in Balochistan.

Ex-PM Imran Khan And Bushra Bibi Jailed For 17 Years In Toshakhana Gift Jewellery Case





Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan has asked his supporters to prepare for nationwide protests and said he will challenge his conviction in the Islamabad High Court after he and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the Toshakhana-II corruption case on Saturday.Khan, who does not currently have access to his social media accounts, conveyed his message through his legal team.According to a post on X cited by Dawn, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder said he had instructed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to begin preparations for a mass street movement. “I have sent a message to [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM] Sohail Afridi to prepare for the street movement.

Quoted by ANI, residents and journalists in Lahore and Peshawar questioned the credibility of the ruling, with some alleging political motives and a lack of evidence, saying the verdict had further weakened public trust in the justice system and democratic institutions.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the Toshakhana-II corruption case on Saturday.

‘Might Never See Him Again’: Imran Khan’s Sons Claim 'Psychological Torture' In Pak's Adiala Jail





NEW DELHI: The Pakistan government on Saturday clarified that there is ""no embargo"" on former prime minister Imran Khan 's sons meeting their incarcerated father if they travel to the country. The government official also said the brothers would be granted Pakistani visas should they wish to come and visit him.The statement came after reports suggested that authorities had imposed unannounced restrictions on visits to Imran Khan, claiming that some visitors were using the meetings to advance political agendas. Following these reports, members of his family and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) expressed concern about the conditions in which he is being held.""There has been no embargo on Suleman Khan and Kasim Khan to meet their father, Imran Khan, at Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi,"" Interior state minister Talal Chaudhry told reporters.Suleman and Kasim, who currently live in London, are Khan’s sons from his first marriage to British TV personality Jemima Goldsmith.Chaudhry’s clarification comes days after the brothers told Sky News they fear they may never see their jailed father again.The brothers said they have not seen or spoken to the PTI founder, imprisoned since August 2023, for months, and voiced concerns about his safety and well-being.“If Suleman and Kasim apply for a Pakistani visa, we will give them. We will not stop them from meeting their father; therefore, the propaganda that the Pakistani government is creating hurdles in the meeting between father and sons should be stopped,” Chaudhry said.He also rejected reports that Khan is being kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day.In their interview, the brothers alleged that their father is being held in isolation, calling the conditions “clear torture tactics.”Khan, who has been in jail since August 2023, faces multiple cases filed against him since his ouster from power in April 2022.A United Nations special rapporteur has also warned that Khan is being held in conditions that may amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.In the interview, Kasim claimed Khan is confined to a cell measuring “six feet by eight inches,” barely large enough to stand.“They are not even allowing guards to speak to him because they want total isolation from any other person, just to try and break him. So it’s all very clear torture tactics,” he said.","Suleman and Kasim Khan are Imran Khan's sons from his first marriage.

NEW DELHI: A special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency on Saturday sentenced former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years of imprisonment each in the Toshakhana 2 corruption case, Dawn reported.The court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million (INR 52,39,524) on each of them. Failure to pay the fine will result in additional jail time, according to the law.Citing the court order copy, Dawn reported that the sentences took into account Imran Khan’s age and the fact that Bushra Bibi is a woman, resulting in what the court described as a “lenient” punishment. “This court, while passing sentences has considered the old age of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, as well as the fact that Bushra Imran Khan is a female. It is in consideration of both said factors that a lenient view has been taken in awarding lesser punishment,” the order said.The verdict was delivered by special judge central Shahrukh Arjumand during a hearing held at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Imran Khan is currently imprisoned.According to Dawn, the case relates to the alleged purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set that was gifted to Imran Khan by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021 and later acquired at a throwaway price.Imran Khan was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison, including 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment under sections 34 and 409 of the Pakistan Penal Code and seven years under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Bushra Bibi was awarded the same sentence under identical provisions.The court also granted the benefit of Section 382 B of the Criminal Procedure Code, which allows the period of detention already undergone to be considered while awarding the sentence.Following the verdict, lawyers representing Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi said they would challenge the decision before the high court.The two were indicted in the case in December last year. Dawn noted that earlier this year in October, both had denied the allegations, calling the case fabricated and politically motivated.As per Dawn, while recording his statement under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Imran Khan rejected the prosecution’s narrative and said the case was “malicious, fabricated, and politically engineered”. He argued that he did not qualify as a public servant under the Pakistan Penal Code and claimed he was unaware of the specific details of the gift, which he said was presented to his wife.Dawn further reported that the PTI founder maintained that due process was followed under the Toshakhana Policy 2018 and that the gift was declared, assessed and legally retained after payment to the national exchequer. “We complied with the Toshakhana Policy in letter and spirit,” he said.","Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi sentenced to 17 years of imprisonment each in corruption case.

Pakistan police on Wednesday registered a case under the Anti-Terrorism Act against the sisters of former prime minister Imran Khan and dozens of his supporters after a protest sit-in outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.The protest on Tuesday was held after authorities refused to allow family members and lawyers to meet Khan, who is currently incarcerated. His sisters, along with leaders and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), staged the sit-in outside the jail to protest the restriction.Police said a first information report (FIR) was lodged at Police Station Saddar Beroni, Rawalpindi, naming Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan and Noreen Niazi, as well as several PTI leaders and supporters. Those named include Salman Akram Raja, Naeem Panjotha, Qasim Khan, Aliya Hamza and Raja Nasir Abbas.Authorities also invoked Section 120 of the Pakistan Penal Code for alleged criminal conspiracy against the state, along with charges of attacking police personnel and violating Section 144.Police said, as reported by PTI, at least 14 suspects were arrested at the scene late Tuesday night, and efforts are continuing to arrest others named in the FIR.Imran Khan has been in jail since August 2023 and faces multiple cases filed after his removal from office in April 2022.Officials have placed restrictions on meetings with Khan, saying such visits are being used for political purposes.

Survival without transformation





How is Pakistan’s economy still surviving? The question continues to arise as the country grapples with prolonged economic stress despite years of weak growth and low human development indicators.In recent years, Pakistan has dealt with sharp currency swings, runaways inflation between 2022 and 2024, persistent balance-of-payments pressures and mounting external debt burden. Yet the economy has managed to dodge a complete collapse, largely due to repeated bailouts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and emergency financing from external partners.China has been key to this survival. Chinese loans and infrastructure investments have provided short-term relief but have also deepened Islamabad's financial dependence on Beijing. At the same time, Pakistan has sought to rebuild ties with the United States, long regarded as a key economic and diplomatic backstop.In this outreach, both army chief Asim Munir, now seen as the Pakistan's de facto power centre, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have taken apparent steps to engage Washington. The two leaders went ahead to nominate US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in easing military tensions with India.However, New Delhi had turned down the claims of any foreign influence in peaceful agreement with Islamabad in May this year.And Uncle Sam responded with goodwill. Compared to several other countries, it was exempted from steep trade tariffs, with Washington announcing a lower levy of 19%. Trump has also spoken of possible cooperation in developing what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" in Pakistan.The power structure in Pakistan has also been a point of concern in its economic turmoil. The military's expanding role in governance has often overshadowed the civilian leadership, while former prime minister and a popular leader Imran Khan remains in prison, keeping political tensions high and weighing on investor confidence.Neighbouring countries have also added to Pakistan’s economic strain. India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty has emerged as a major setback, while Afghanistan’s Taliban government has announced plans to build dams upstream, moves that could further affect water availability and pose another risk to Pakistan’s economy and GDP growth.For now, Pakistan’s economy continues to function through foreign assistance, administrative controls and short-term stabilisation measures. Without sustained political stability, meaningful reforms and an effective check on corruption, its economic survival remains fragile.One of the most important stabilisers of Pakistan's economy has been the continued support from the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral lenders.The Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA) finalised in November 2025, was released ahead of the Fund's executive board's expected approval of a $1.2 billion disbursement, part of the ongoing 37-month, $7 billion programme started under the prime ministership of Shehbaz Sharif.With the latest approval, Pakistan has received around $3.3 billion from the IMF since last year. Under the bailout programme, Islamabad will continue to receive loan instalments over a 37-month period, contingent on meeting the agreed reform conditions.Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal, which was followed by the current longer programme. Since 1958, Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times, making it one of the IMF's most frequent borrowers.In 2025, IMF disbursements helped rebuild foreign exchange buffers, reassure markets and finance imports and debt servicing, according to Reuters.Pakistan's central bank has used monetary policy as a tactical tool to stabilise inflation while cautiously supporting growth.On December 15, the State Bank of Pakistan cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 10.5%, breaking a four-meeting hold. The SBP said the move was aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth while keeping inflation within target.According to Reuters, all 12 analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the central bank to hold the policy rate at 11%, particularly after the IMF warned against premature easing under Pakistan's $7 billion loan programme.The rate cut highlighted Pakistan's effort to revive domestic economic activity without destabilising the IMF-backed stabilisation framework.Despite underlying weaknesses, Pakistan has seen improving sentiment in financial markets.Credit ratings agencies S&P Global, Fitch and Moody’s upgraded Pakistan’s credit ratings in 2025, citing stronger finances and revenue gains. Investor appetite for Pakistan’s dollar bonds and equities has strengthened, with bonds delivering nearly 22% returns this year and the benchmark stock index gaining 44%, among the best performers in Asia.Bloomberg Economics estimates growth quickened to 3.4% year-on-year in the second quarter, with official data expected shortly.However, with the backdrop of political chaos, most notably the continued imprisonment of the country's most popular political figure, Imran Khan, investors have little confidence to make long-term plans in Pakistan.Pakistan has also moved to rebuild economic ties with the United States.According to Bloomberg, Islamabad is planning an investor conference in Washington to draw American investment in energy, mining and technology. Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the sectors where Pakistan seeks US investment are clearly identified.Economic links have improved following a new US-Pakistan trade deal setting a 19% tariff, lower than regional peers and well below the 50% tariff imposed on India.Meanwhile, Trump also promised to help Pakistan develop what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" on Pakistani soil. The remarks followed sustained praise and outreach from Pakistan’s de facto power centre, army chief Asim Munir, and were later echoed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who went on to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize on several occasions.“The first thing was to get the trade equation out of the way, which it is now,” Aurangzeb told Bloomberg.""Every single industry in Pakistan has to have an export component, because it’s the only way we're going to get out of this boom-and-bust cycle,"" Aurangzeb added.Beyond Western partners, Pakistan continues to rely heavily on China.According to the Middle East Institute, Pakistan’s strategic reliance on Beijing has deepened, particularly through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). In January, Dawn reported that Pakistan and China reaffirmed their commitment to high-quality development of CPEC 2.0, focusing on industrialisation, special economic zones, clean energy, agriculture and livelihood projects.Chinese support has provided Pakistan with infrastructure investment, energy projects and diplomatic backing at moments of economic stress.While IMF financing has stabilised Pakistan, the IMF's own assessment paints a deeply troubling picture of governance in the Islamic Republic.The IMF's Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment concluded that corruption in Pakistan is driven by ""state capture"", where public policy is manipulated to benefit a narrow circle of political and business elites.The 186-page report described dysfunctional institutions unable to enforce the rule of law or protect public resources. Corruption, the IMF said, is persistent and corrosive, distorting markets, eroding public trust and undermining fiscal stability.The report warns that without dismantling entrenched structures of elite privilege, Pakistan’s economic stagnation will persist.According to the IMF, the most economically damaging corruption involves privileged entities that exert influence over key economic sectors, including those owned by or affiliated with the state.Stefan Dercon, a professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford who has advised Pakistan on reforms, told Al Jazeera that lack of accountability continues to erode economic potential.""Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,"" Dercon said.Ali Hasanain, associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s findings mirror long-standing domestic research.""The IMF diagnostic repeats what many domestic studies, including those by the World Bank and Pakistan’s own institutions, have already emphasised: Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,"" Hasanain told Al Jazeera.A 2021 UNDP report found that economic privileges granted to Pakistan’s elite, including politicians and the powerful military, amount to roughly 6 percent of GDP.The IMF report also flags governance risks linked to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), created in June 2023 to promote investment and comprising both civilian and military leaders.The GCDA raises concerns over broad legal immunity granted to SIFC officials and the council’s authority to exempt projects from regulatory requirements.“The recently established Special Investment Facilitation Council, which has been vested with substantial authority to facilitate foreign investments, operates with untested transparency and accountability provisions,” the IMF report said.The Fund urged greater transparency, including annual public reporting on investments facilitated and concessions granted.The World Bank has warned that macroeconomic stabilisation has not translated into meaningful improvements in living standards.""Business as usual is not good for the economy,"" said Mukhtar Ul Hasan, World Bank economist and lead author of a report on Pakistan.""Pakistan's growth potential has been declining for decades"" due to weak competitiveness, limited reforms and recurring crises, he added.The World Bank projects growth of 3% this year and 3.4% next year, far below what is needed to absorb 1.6 million new labour market entrants annually.The Bank’s poverty and resilience report shows poverty rising again to over 27% by 2023–24, with nearly half the population living below the lower-middle-income poverty line. Rural areas, especially Balochistan and interior Sindh, face far greater deprivation.Geopolitics has added new economic risks.After a Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians, India answered strongly to its misadventure by putting the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance. Islamabad responded by warning that any attempt to stop or divert water flows would be treated as an ""act of war.""Around 80% of Pakistani farms depend on the Indus system, as do nearly all hydropower projects. India had also identified hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir that could expand capacity to 12,000 MW from the current 3,360 MW, according to Reuters.In May 2025 India’s crossborder counterterror action under Operation Sindoor, marked a sharp escalation in India-Pakistan security dynamics. Military operations and reciprocal measures elevate defence spending, crowd out development spending, spook investors, and raise insurance and logistics costs for trade.Pakistan suffered a major setback after Indian strikes severely damaged nine of its key airbases, including Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan, dealing a significant blow to its military infrastructure.Pakistan’s economic capacity has been heavily drained by sustained military expenditure driven by its adversarial policies toward India, a burden that has come at the cost of investment in social sectors and has pushed the country down across multiple human development indicators.Reports indicate Afghanistan's new dam projects on rivers that feed Pakistan (Kunar/Kabul tributaries) will further diminish cross-border flows into Pakistan’s north-west. Combined with India’s measures, this convergence would be a ""double blast"" to Pakistani water security — concentrated in already drought-prone provinces that supply major agricultural output.Reduced river flows affect irrigation, livelihoods and hydroelectricity; they also fuel internal migration pressures and raise the social cost of adjustment. Regional cooperation mechanisms for water management have weakened, making unilateral upstream development a direct economic shock for downstream Pakistan.Pakistan’s economy is surviving due to IMF support, tactical policy moves, selective foreign investment and geopolitical manoeuvring, including heavy dependence on China and US.But without deep structural reform, dismantling elite privilege and restoring institutional accountability, survival may continue without delivering broad-based prosperity, leaving the country trapped in the same cycle of crisis and rescue that has defined its economic history.","Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal. Since 1958, Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times, making it one of the IMF's most borrowers. Without sustained political stability, meaningful reforms and an effective check on corruption, Pakistan's economic survival remains fragile.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126040218,imgsize-1276209,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-82.jpg"

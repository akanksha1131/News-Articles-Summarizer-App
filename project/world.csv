'We will hunt you down': Kash Patel warns enemies of America after FBI confirmation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-will-hunt-you-down-kash-patel-warns-enemies-of-america-after-fbi-confirmation/articleshow/118436772.cms,"US president Donald Trump 's newly appointed FBI chief Kash Patel on Thursday vowed to make the federal agency transparent, accountable, and committed to justice.In his first reaction after the confirmation by the US Senate, Patel warned those who try to harm America and reiterated his promise to rebuild trust in the FBI.""I am honored to be confirmed as the ninth Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Thank you to President Trump and Attorney General Bondi for your unwavering confidence and support. The FBI has a storied legacy—from the “G-Men” to safeguarding our nation in the wake of 9/11. The American people deserve an FBI that is transparent, accountable, and committed to justice. The politicalization of our justice system has eroded public trust—but that ends today,"" Patel wrote on X.""My mission as Director is clear: let good cops be cops—and rebuild trust in the FBI.

‘What is Chinese navy doing this far south?’: Australia and New Zealand monitor ‘unusual’ presence of Chinese warships in Tasman Sea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/what-is-chinese-navy-doing-this-far-south-australia-and-new-zealand-monitor-unusual-presence-of-chinese-warships-in-tasman-sea/articleshow/118435328.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

Australia and New Zealand’s response

Australia and New Zealand are vigilantly observing a Chinese naval task force in the Tasman Sea, expressing unease about the warships' unexplained presence in unusually southern waters.The Chinese fleet, comprising a Renhai-class cruiser, a frigate and a supply ship, was initially spotted last week near Australia's northeastern shores, subsequently moving 150 nautical miles east of Sydney, outside territorial waters but within its exclusive economic zone, as reported by The Financial Times.Australia's deputy Prime Minister and defence minister Richard Marles mentioned that whilst the Chinese vessels were operating within legal bounds, their activities were under close observation.""We are keeping close watch on them, and we will be making sure that we watch every move,"" Marles said in a television interview. He observed that whilst Chinese naval presence in the region isn't unprecedented, vessels of this calibre rarely venture this far south.New Zealand's defence minister Judith Collins voiced her concerns about the Chinese government's lack of communication regarding the mission's objectives and future plans.""We have not been informed by the Chinese government why this task group has been deployed into our region, and we have not been informed what its future plans are,"" Collins told reporters in Wellington, according to The New Zealand Herald.One of the ships, the Zunyi, is a Renhai-class cruiser described by the US Naval Institute as ""among the most formidable warships afloat."" The deployment of such a heavily armed vessel suggests China is demonstrating its naval power, according to Collin Koh, a senior fellow at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.""It's meant to signal to Australia and to the US that the PLA Navy is not going to be constrained in movements and actions,"" Koh said, as per The New York Times.Last week, a Chinese fighter jet had a tense encounter with an Australian surveillance aircraft over the South China Sea. The Australian defence forces accused China of ""unsafe and unprofessional"" conduct, while China claimed Australia was engaging in provocation.In September, China launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that landed in the Pacific Ocean, a move that Judith Collins described as contributing to growing regional tensions.Maritime security expert Bec Strating from La Trobe University highlighted that China’s movements could be an intelligence-gathering operation or a signal to Australia about its growing naval presence.""What is the Chinese navy doing this far south? That is the thing causing anxiety. Is this intelligence gathering? Is this really just signaling to Australia that the Chinese are also able to have naval presence in these areas?"" The New York Times quoted Strating.The Australian defence force is monitoring the ships from the sea and air, while New Zealand has deployed its military to coordinate surveillance efforts with Australia.A spokesperson for Australia’s defence department was quoted by Newsweek saying that while Australia respects the rights of all states to operate in international waters, it remains cautious about China's growing naval reach.""Australia respects the rights of all states to exercise freedom of navigation and overflight in international waters and airspace, under international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,"" the spokesperson said.As of now, it remains unclear how long the Chinese naval task group will remain in the Tasman Sea or where it is heading next. Chinese state media has previously referred to similar missions as ""far-sea combat drills"" in the Pacific Ocean.New Zealand’s Judith Collins described the presence of highly capable Chinese warships so far south as a ""significant"" development, adding that both Australia and New Zealand would continue joint surveillance efforts.","A Chinese naval task force has been spotted in the Tasman Sea, 150 nautical miles east of Sydney.

South Korea says asked US to exclude it from new tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/south-korea-says-asked-us-to-exclude-it-from-new-tariffs/articleshow/118435848.cms,"(AP photo)

SEOUL: South Korea has asked Washington to exclude it from planned US tariffs on steel and aluminium, Seoul's trade ministry said Friday.US President Donald Trump has announced a broad range of levies on some of his country's biggest trading partners since taking office in January, arguing that they will help tackle unfair practices.Among them are 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from March 12.He also warned this week that he would impose tariffs ""in the neighbourhood of 25 percent"" on auto imports and a similar amount or higher on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.South Korea is home to the world's key chipmakers, Samsung and SK hynix, and was the fourth-largest exporter of steel to the United States last year.On Friday, Seoul said Deputy Trade Minister Park Jong-won asked the United States not to include South Korea ""in mutual tariffs and various tariff measures such as those on steel and aluminium"".He emphasised the contributions of large-scale investments by South Korean firms to the US economy and noted that ""under the Seoul-Washington free trade agreement, tariffs on nearly all items between the two countries have already been eliminated"".The request was made during Park's trip to Washington this week, the ministry said, during which he spoke to officials from the White House and the US Department of Commerce, among others.South Korea's steel industry has faced intense pressure in recent years as it grapples with oversupply -- particularly from China -- and a decrease in global demand.The US tariffs are likely to intensify those challenges, and analysts warn that should cheap Chinese steel barred from the US market begin to flood regions like Southeast Asia and Europe, South Korean steel producers will face deepening price competition.","South Korea has asked Washington to exclude it from planned US tariffs on steel and aluminium.

NEW YORK: Six US prison workers accused of beating to death a handcuffed Black inmate were indicted Thursday on second-degree murder charges , in a case that has sparked outrage.Robert Brooks's death at New York's Marcy Correctional Facility in December 2024 was caught on the officers' bodycams.The footage showed several officers restraining a man, whose hands were cuffed behind him for at least part of the attack, with one uniformed officer kicking him during a struggle.As the inmate sat up, visibly wounded, an officer put on a surgical glove and grabbed him again by the collar and, with the help of a colleague, slammed him against a wall.The footage was released by New York Attorney General Letitia James who called the scenes ""shocking and disturbing.""Three others were charged with involuntary manslaughter for failing to prevent the death of Brooks, who was serving a 12-year sentence for assault at Marcy Prison, located near the Canadian border.A 10th prison worker was charged with allegedly cleaning up the scene and attempting to conceal evidence.The accused acted with ""depraved indifference to human life, recklessly engaged in conduct which created a grave risk of death to another person, and thereby caused the death of Robert Brooks,"" the indictment issued by special prosecutor William Fitzpatrick said.New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she had given the order to ""immediately begin the termination process for 14 individuals who were involved in the fatal attack on an incarcerated individual at Marcy Correctional Facility.""""This action comes after I directed an internal review of the circumstances that lead to this individual's death,"" she said.The United States is regularly rocked by violence committed by law enforcement officers.In 2020, the murder of George Floyd, a Black man who was suffocated under a police officer's knee, sparked a huge wave of anti-racism protests across the country.",Robert Brooks's death at New York's Marcy Correctional Facility in December 2024 was caught on the officers' bodycams.

At the FII Priority Summit in Miami on Thursday, US President Donald Trump warned that "" World War III is not so far away"" but said that his leadership would prevent it. He also added that if former President Joe Biden's administration had continued, the world would already be in conflict.""There’s no profit for anyone in having World War III, and you're not so far away from it,"" Trump said. ""If we would've had this administration for another year, you would've been in a war three, and now it's not going to happen.""Trump pointed out that while the US would avoid involvement in ongoing conflicts, his administration would work to prevent them. ""We’re going to stop people from these stupid, never-ending wars. We’re not going to partake in them ourselves, but we’ll be stronger and more powerful than anybody by far,"" he stated, adding that he doesn’t expect the US to face war.Quoting Elon Musk in a post on X, Trump wrote, ""Elon Musk: The President's instincts on Ukraine are absolutely right. It is really sad that so many parents have lost their sons, and so many sons their fathers in this pointless war.""On Wednesday, Trump criticised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, claiming that the US has spent $200 billion more than Europe while receiving no return on investment. He questioned Europe's financial contributions, accusing Zelenskyy of convincing the US to invest heavily in a war he believes cannot be won. Trump also labelled Zelenskyy a dictator for governing without elections.In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 billion dollars, to go into a war that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a war that he, without the US and ‘TRUMP,’ will never be able to settle.""","US President Donald Trump warned that "" World War III is not so far away"" but said that his leadership would prevent it.

Leland Dudek: Who is Leland Dudek? Pro-DOGE ‘anti-fraud expert’ takes over as SSA chief after Michelle King’s exit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-leland-dudek-pro-doge-anti-fraud-expert-takes-over-as-ssa-chief-after-michelle-kings-exit/articleshow/118404751.cms,"Who is Leland Dudek?

Dudek’s vision for SSA

Michelle King’s departure

Concerns over data access

Leland Dudek , a longtime ' anti-fraud expert ' at the Social Security Administration (SSA), has been appointed as the agency’s acting chief following the sudden departure of Michelle King . His appointment comes amid growing debate over Elon Musk ’s department of government efficiency ( DOGE ) and its efforts to access sensitive social security data.Dudek, who previously led the SSA’s fraud investigation office, has spent his career working to combat fraud within the agency. However, his cooperation with DOGE nearly cost him his job. In a now-deleted post by The Daily Wire., Dudek revealed that he had been placed on administrative leave for working with DOGE officials to identify inefficiencies within SSA.“At 4.30pm EST, my boss called me to tell me I had been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation,” he wrote on his LinkedIn. “They want to fire me for cooperating with DOGE.”Just days later, the tables turned. Instead of being dismissed, Dudek was reinstated and given a major promotion, taking over King’s role as acting commissioner.The LinkedIn post read: “I confess. I helped DOGE understand SSA. I mailed myself publicly accessible documents and explained them to DOGE. I confess. I moved contractor money around to add data science resources to my anti-fraud team. I confess. I asked where the fat was and is in our contracts so we can make the right tough choices.”“I confess. I bullied agency executives, shared executive contact information, and circumvented the chain of command to connect DOGE with the people who get stuff done,” the post continued. “Everything I have ever done is in service to our country, our beneficiaries, and our agency.”Dudek has vowed to lead SSA with transparency. In an email to staff, he emphasised his commitment to protecting the agency’s integrity. Meanwhile, critics fear that his appointment signals greater DOGE influence over social security data.Republican lawmakers have welcomed the leadership change, with Senator Mike Lee’s spokesperson, Billy Gribbin, stating, “There are many good civil servants who have been quietly frustrated for years with politically-motivated mismanagement… Put them in charge, hand them scalpels and flamethrowers.”Dudek will serve as acting commissioner until Trump’s nominee, Frank Bisignano, is confirmed by the Senate. His appointment marks a significant shift in the agency’s direction, with debates raging over whether his leadership will enhance anti-fraud efforts or compromise the security of millions of Americans’ private data.Michelle King’s resignation has raised significant questions, with reports suggesting she was pushed out after resisting DOGE’s attempts to access the SSA’s Enterprise Data Warehouse, a hub containing sensitive information on millions of Americans. According to Nancy Altman, president of advocacy group Social Security Works, King stood her ground against DOGE’s efforts.“She was standing in the way and they moved her out of the way,” Altman was quoted as saying CBS News. “They put someone in who presumably they thought would cooperate with them and give them the keys to all our personal data.”The White House has not provided a reason for King’s departure, but her exit follows a pattern of high-ranking officials resigning or being removed amid concerns about DOGE’s expanding reach.DOGE, created under Trump’s administration and heavily influenced by his adviser Elon Musk, has been accused of overreach, with reports suggesting it has already accessed Treasury payment systems and is seeking entry into Internal Revenue Service (IRS) databases. Altman warned that SSA’s data contains highly sensitive records, including information on nearly every American with a Social Security number.“There is no way to overstate how serious a breach this is,” Altman told The Associated Press. “If there is an evil intent to punish perceived enemies, someone could erase your earnings record, making it impossible to collect the Social Security and Medicare benefits you have earned.”",Leland Dudek has been appointed as the agency’s acting chief following the sudden departure of Michelle King.

US President Donald Trump has suggested that the Biden administration was ""trying to get somebody else elected"" in India last year with a $21 million USAID grant for voter turnout in the country.Obliquely hinting that his predecessor's administration was backing the opposition Congress Party and its allies, Trump told a Saudi-backed investment conference in Miami, ""We have got to tell the Indian Government... This is a total breakthrough."" Trump is perceived as having a close relationship with Modi despite differences between the two countries on trade.It was not clear what the US President meant by breakthrough, nor did he offer any evidence for his claim. But Trump framed the purported poll interference in India with allegations by many Democrats and liberals in US that Russia puts it thumb on the US election scale to get him (Trump) elected in the US elections in 2016.""Russia spent about $2 in our country. It was a big deal, right? They took some internet ads for $2,000"" Trump scoffed in a reference to frequent charges that he is a ""Putin stooge,"" allegations that continue to echo in liberal and progressive circles in the US, particularly now that he has virtually thrown Ukraine and NATO under the Russian bus.Trump has long resented the allegations and denied them, arguing that he is tough on Russia even though there is no particular reason for Washington to be at odds with Moscow. Republicans and Democrats have also traded charges about each other's alleged shenanigans in Ukraine.Trump has often made the case for US non-interference and against ""nation-building"" in other parts of the world, although that sentiment is now at odds with his and his minions' interference in countries from Canada to Germany to South Africa, and his proposals to evict Gazans and rebuild the territory.The US President's swipe at the previous administration and its purported backing of the Congress party electrified many supporters of the BJP in India who believe Trump and Modi face the same liberal enemies. The BJP's IT cell went to town with the allegations, with its head Amit Malviya charging that US funding for “Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance” spiked in 2022, coinciding with Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra.""There was a systematic attempt to influence the 2024 general election to ensure alternate outcome. This is just a small slice of the larger conspiracy,"" Malviya alleged, referring to Trump's $21 million question.In fact, the US under both Republican and Democratic administrations has a long history of meddling in the politics of other countries, including in India going back to the 1950s when the CIA backed Congress and its allies against the Communist Party in Kerala.The effort, well-chronicled by political historians, was aimed at forestalling the growing ""Red menace"" across Asia, leading to the first elected Communist government outside Russia and China, in Kerala.","US President Donald Trump suggested that the Biden administration was ""trying to get somebody else elected"" in India last year with a $21 million USAID grant.

"'No choice': Why Xi Jinping is playing nice with Jack Ma, other Chinese tech billionaires",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/no-choice-why-xi-jinping-is-playing-nice-with-jack-ma-other-chinese-tech-billionaires/articleshow/118423021.cms,"Chinese President Xi Jinping. (Zhan Zheng//Xinhua via AP)

Why it matters

The meeting is widely seen as an effort to reassure business leaders and investors that China is committed to supporting private enterprises after years of heavy-handed interventions.

The regulatory clampdown on the tech sector, which began in 2020, wiped trillions off the value of Chinese stocks, stifled innovation, and led to the retreat of high-profile entrepreneurs like Ma from the public eye.

With an economy struggling to recover from the pandemic, Beijing now needs the private sector more than ever to drive growth and maintain technological competitiveness.

The backdrop

By the numbers

On February 14, Alibaba’s stock jumped 6.2%—adding $18 billion to its market value—on rumors of Xi’s meeting with business leaders.

Tencent and Xiaomi saw stock gains of around 7%.

The Hang Seng Tech Index, tracking China’s largest tech firms, has surged 23% in the past month, with Alibaba shares up over 50%.

What’s driving the shift

Economic necessity: Beijing’s crackdown on tech firms erased about $2 trillion from China’s stock markets. With sluggish growth and low investor confidence, the government now needs the private sector to help stabilize the economy.

AI and tech innovation: DeepSeek , a Chinese AI firm, has managed to keep up with Silicon Valley despite US chip restrictions. Investors see AI as a potential new growth driver, akin to Alibaba’s 2014 IPO.

, a Chinese AI firm, has managed to keep up with Silicon Valley despite US chip restrictions. Investors see AI as a potential new growth driver, akin to Alibaba’s 2014 IPO. Global competition: The US has ramped up efforts to cut China off from key technologies, including semiconductors. To compete, China must rely on private sector innovation, especially in AI and cloud computing.

""It's a tacit acknowledgement that the Chinese government needs private-sector firms for its tech rivalry with the United States,"" Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics in Hong Kong, told Reuters. ""The government has no choice but to support them if it wants to compete with the United States.""

The bigger picture

Over the past few years, China’s regulatory crackdowns on tech giants sent a clear message: the government is in control. These crackdowns targeted monopolistic practices, financial risks, and data security concerns.

The crackdown on Alibaba and Ant Group was followed by tighter regulations on private tutoring, gaming, and online lending, causing widespread investor uncertainty.

As China’s economy continues to face headwinds, including a sluggish property market and weak consumer demand, reversing sentiment toward the private sector is becoming a priority.

Between the lines

What they are saying

Renewed enthusiasm for China’s tech firms is based mostly on the false premise that DeepSeek’s breakthrough in AI will drive a renaissance in the sector’s earnings outlook. We disagree and believe the earnings outlook at most firms remains largely unchanged. Rising economic uncertainty, plus the risk of escalating tensions with the US, make for an uncertain sector outlook in 2025 Analysts Robert Lea and Jasmine Lyu at Bloomberg

Gary Ng, senior economist for Natixis, Hong Kong:

What’s next

Annual legislative leeting in March: Officials are expected to unveil the economic blueprint for 2025, with potential measures to support private enterprises.

IPO regulations: Beijing’s stance on overseas listings remains uncertain, with reports of companies like Shein navigating opaque regulatory processes.

AI development: China’s push into AI and advanced computing will be a key indicator of how much leeway private firms receive in shaping the country’s technological future.

Will this change last?

Skeptics argue that while Xi’s meeting signals a shift, it does not necessarily mean a return to the unregulated boom years of the past.

Government control over the tech sector remains strong. Beijing still mandates strict compliance with its regulations, ensuring that tech firms prioritize national interests over profit-driven motives.

The concept of ""common prosperity"" remains a key priority, meaning that tech firms will be expected to contribute to social and economic programs.

Entrepreneurs must now play by the party’s rules—or face exile. While Xi’s latest overtures may boost investor sentiment, they do little to erase the regulatory scars left by years of crackdowns. Business leaders may be allowed back into the fold, but they will do so under the watchful eye of the Communist Party.

China’s President Xi Jinping met with leading private sector entrepreneurs on February 17, including Alibaba founder Jack Ma , signaling a shift in Beijing’s approach toward its tech sector after years of regulatory crackdowns. The move comes as China faces economic challenges, declining business confidence, and growing concerns over technological competition with the U.S.China’s Communist Party has a long history of purging and later rehabilitating figures of influence. Deng Xiaoping was purged three times before leading China out of Maoism. Today, a similar process appears to be at play for business leaders.Jack Ma’s downfall began with his public criticism of China’s financial regulators in 2020. The government responded by blocking Ant Group’s IPO, launching a probe into Alibaba, and imposing a record fine. Ma disappeared from the public eye for years.His reemergence alongside Xi suggests a strategic shift, as the government attempts to strike a balance between regulation and economic revival.Xi’s meeting reassured entrepreneurs of policy stability, but questions remain about the extent of real regulatory easing.While Beijing acknowledges the private sector’s importance, control remains paramount. Tech firms are still expected to align with state priorities, particularly in AI and cybersecurity.Despite the meeting’s positive signals, China’s business confidence remains fragile. Entrepreneurs want more than rhetoric; they need tangible policy changes, such as eased IPO approvals and relaxed financing restrictions.Analysts see this meeting as a significant shift in China’s approach to the private sector, but remain cautious about long-term implications.According to a Reuters report, here are some expert comments on the meeting:""We believe the event will likely be followed by concrete pro-technology policies. Potential moves include shifting focus from 'national security risks and social externalities' to a more risk-taking approach to technology application.""(This would) include potentially accelerating the mass deployment of generative AI, autonomous driving, and humanoid robotics.""Similarly, securities regulators are likely to adopt a more accommodative stance, allowing technology companies greater access to capital markets to finance growth, which could help resolve uncertainties around listing and re-listing timelines (e.g., Didi, Ant, Temu).""""That President Xi chaired this symposium signals a recognition from China’s top party leadership of the significant role that Chinese private firms can play in the support of growth, and, more importantly, in realising the technological ambitions of China in the face of growing Western restrictions.""We should expect more support to the private sector, especially in areas of strategic importance for the country.""Despite their flaws, DeepSeek now, and Huawei’s Kirin chip before, send a strong message to the West: that China not only has the intention but also resources and capacity to innovate its way out of technology restrictions, no matter how costly.""""President Xi's meeting with Chinese private entrepreneurs clearly represents a major course correction.""The private sector, long the backbone of the Chinese economy and the most important growth engine, has been battered in recent years by mounting policy and regulatory uncertainties, with dire consequences to China's economy, and worse, to its labour market with rising youth unemployment.""The leadership's well-publicised meeting with some of the country's most high-profile entrepreneurs, such as Jack Ma, could not come at a more critical juncture.""It should help reassure rattled entrepreneurs and lift up business and investor confidence in China.""""The tech crackdown has been definitively over for some time and the government has been trying to push increased confidence for the private sector, and tech sector, in particular.""There's been some continued scepticism because at the end of the day it's Xi Jinping's opinion that matters most. You cannot do better than having Xi Jinping personally give the nod of approval.""I think it took so long to have this meeting because Xi is changing course.""""I think the meeting’s purpose is to make sure that the private sector understands, for the stability and for the growth of the economy, they are a very important part of the economy.""I think the purpose is to tell them, 'We want to support you. We need you to boost innovation, technological innovation, and we need you to boost consumption.' I think (the purpose is) to inject confidence in there.""""Despite the rising opportunities in the case of DeepSeek, it is also about guiding the private sector in the government-led direction and containing the potential risks to compete with the United States.""The market reads it as a positive signal to include Jack Ma in such a meeting and hope for the end of the tech crackdown. Still, the regulatory environment is the black box.""As most AI development happens in the private sector, we cannot entirely rule out the outcome of a tighter-than-market-expected regulatory environment than we see now.""(With inputs from agencies)","Beijing’s crackdown on tech firms erased about $2 trillion from China's stock markets. With sluggish growth and low investor confidence, the government now needs the private sector to help stabilize the economy. Rising economic uncertainty, plus the risk of escalating tensions with the US, make for an uncertain sector outlook in 2025.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118423404,imgsize-83366,width-400,resizemode-4/118423404.jpg"

Amid TikTok's uncertain future in the country until it comes under a US owner, 40-year-old Reid Rasner has made an offer to buy TikTok for $50 billion. According to reports, the wealthy Wyoming entrepreneur has approached Chinese parent company ByteDance with his offer.Reid Rasner heads a media company and founded several firms in the state. In his offer, he said he wants to buy TikTok for Wyoming as he wants Wyoming to have jobs. “By establishing TikTok’s operations in Wyoming, Reid will ignite a new era of economic diversification, creating thousands of high-paying jobs that will not only benefit the tech sector but also supercharge Wyoming’s energy, agriculture, and tourism industries,” the letter from Rasner Media counsel Steve Roberts states.“This initiative will bring high-skilled workers, cutting-edge innovation, and new investment opportunities into the state, strengthening the economy while ensuring Wyoming remains a national leader in multiple sectors.”“While traditional tech hubs struggle with skyrocketing energy prices and unreliable grids, Wyoming offers unmatched energy stability, efficiency, and sustainability,” the letter says.President Donald Trump promised that he would save TikTok which was not available for download for over three weeks but then came back in February. Trump said he was working to bring TikTok under US ownership before his executive order stalling the ban on the app expires in 75 days. Trump said Microsoft was one of the multiple companies interested in buying TikTok. Vice President JD Vance has been given the responsibility of managing the deal.Rasner is a new name in bidding for TikTok as many names are doing the rounds as possible buyers like billionaires Larry Ellison, Frank McCourt, Shark Tank star Kevin O'Leary.

Elon Musk’s role in government and leadership of DOGE

Steve Bannon’s criticism of the DOGE

“DOGE is sitting there with the budget, but where the f*** are the DOGE cuts? We are 30 days away from approving a budget for the entire year with $2 trillion already baked in, and not one penny of anything that DOGE found. It’s ludicrous.”

DOGE’s policy focus and Elon Musk’s leadership style

Eliminating government diversity programs

Cutting bureaucratic inefficiencies

Introducing technology-driven cost-saving measures

Reactions and political implications



Former top Trump adviser Steve Bannon has intensified his attacks on Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk , accusing him of exploiting his influence in the U.S. government while questioning the legitimacy of his immigration status. According to reports, Bannon referred to the South African-born billionaire as a “parasitic illegal immigrant” and claimed that Musk was undermining American customs and values.The remarks come amid ongoing political tensions surrounding Musk’s increasing presence in government affairs. Since endorsing Donald Trump in June 2024, Musk has become a key figure in the administration, leading the newly established Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). Bannon, a vocal critic of Musk’s growing influence, accused him of acting like ""God"" and pushing drastic changes without regard for national traditions.As per reports, Musk has denied allegations regarding his immigration status and dismissed Bannon’s remarks as “baseless attacks.” However, the controversy has sparked intense debate over Musk’s role in governance, his relationship with the Trump administration, and the effectiveness of DOGE in reducing government waste.During a recent interview, Bannon suggested that Musk may have outstayed his visa while establishing his businesses in the United States, hinting at possible legal irregularities in his residency status. While Musk has repeatedly denied such claims, Bannon insisted that Musk should ""go back to South Africa,"" questioning why White South Africans should have any role in U.S. affairs.Bannon further alleged that White South Africans are ""the most racist people on earth"", implying that Musk's presence in American politics was problematic. His comments sparked immediate backlash, with many calling them divisive and controversial.Bannon has frequently warned against China’s growing influence over American technology and industry, and he now suggests that Musk’s close ties with Chinese officials make him a potential threat. These claims remain unsubstantiated, but they have added fuel to the ongoing scrutiny of Musk’s business and political affiliations.Since endorsing Trump’s re-election campaign in 2024, Musk has become one of the administration’s most influential figures. As the largest campaign donor, he has gained unprecedented access to the White House, frequently meeting with top officials.His influence has extended beyond just financial contributions—Trump appointed Musk as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a newly established division aimed at streamlining federal operations and reducing waste.However, Bannon has strongly opposed Musk’s involvement in government, claiming that his authority is dangerous and unearned. He warned that Musk is “acting like God” and implementing drastic changes that disregard American values and governance traditions.Bannon has also been highly critical of DOGE, arguing that the department is “merely for show” and has failed to deliver on its promises. He mocked its financial management, calling it “performative” and questioning whether the department has made any substantial cost-cutting recommendations.He specifically criticised the lack of budget cuts from DOGE, stating:Under Musk’s leadership, DOGE has primarily focused on:While Musk has promoted these initiatives as necessary government reforms, Bannon believes they are superficial and fail to address larger economic concerns. He insists that DOGE should be making substantial spending cuts rather than focusing on symbolic policy changes.Musk has largely dismissed Bannon’s accusations, calling them “unfounded” and “politically motivated.” He has denied any wrongdoing related to his immigration status and has rejected the notion that his ties to China compromise American interests.In response to claims about DOGE’s inefficiency, Musk’s supporters argue that it is still in its early stages and needs time to implement meaningful reforms.Bannon’s remarks have sparked a broader debate about Musk’s political involvement and the role of private sector leaders in government. Some Republicans view Musk’s contributions as valuable to Trump’s administration, while others share Bannon’s concerns about his level of influence.The controversy surrounding Musk and DOGE is expected to play a significant role in the upcoming political landscape, as discussions about government efficiency, corporate influence, and immigration policies continue to gain traction.","Former top Trump adviser Steve Bannon has intensified his attacks on Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk.

Judge denies union bid to halt Trump firing of government workers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-denies-union-bid-to-halt-trump-firing-of-government-workers/articleshow/118436014.cms,"AP photo

A US judge on Thursday denied a union bid to temporarily halt the firing of thousands of federal employees on probationary status, handing President Donald Trump another legal win in his plan to slash the government workforce.District Judge Christopher Cooper said he lacked the jurisdiction to handle the complaint, one of several filed in courts in recent days in an effort to pause the mass sackings.The judge's decision comes as around 6,700 workers at the 100,000-strong Internal Revenue Service (IRS) who were on probation were being laid off.""The anxiety was running through the floor, like I personally felt anxious because I was one of (the) last people to get that email,"" an IRS probationary worker who was laid off Thursday told AFP.A former IRS official said most of the IRS employees being let go were part of the US tax agency's enforcement teams, less than two months before the US income tax filing deadline of April 15.A number of IRS employees posted messages on LinkedIn saying they had been abruptly terminated and were seeking other opportunities.The National Treasury Employees Union and four other unions that represent federal employees had asked Cooper to issue a temporary restraining order preventing termination of their members who are probationary employees.Cooper, an appointee of former president Barack Obama, said his court lacks jurisdiction to hear their claims and they should instead be brought before the Federal Labor Relations Authority, a body that adjudicates federal labor disputes.""Federal district judges are duty-bound to decide legal issues based on even-handed application of law and precedent -- no matter the identity of the litigants or, regrettably at times, the consequences of their rulings for average people,"" the judge said.- Managers had 'no idea' -The probationary worker who spoke to AFP, on condition of anonymity to freely discuss his former employer, said that managers at the agency had ""no idea"" the layoffs were coming.""I think DOGE has been very careful to make it seem like the agencies themselves are making the decisions, when I can tell, our managers yesterday were just as shocked as we were,"" he said.The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is a free-ranging entity run by Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a top Trump ally and donor.On Thursday, the laid-off IRS worker said staff at his agency were ""a little resigned, a little defeated, including our managers... some of them were, seemed like they were on the verge of tears.""The worker had been a revenue agent on a team that oversaw tax collection for corporations and wealthy individuals.""I think Republicans have really kind of twisted the narrative in the press to say that the IRS has hired a bunch of people to go after middle- or working-class folks, when really a lot of the people that were hired were hired to go after large corporations and high net worth individuals,"" he said.- 'Cruel' -In his opinion, Cooper said the federal government employs 220,000 probationary employees and he noted that workers with that status at the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Park Service and other agencies have already been sacked.On Wednesday, another federal judge declined a request to temporarily block DOGE from firing federal employees.Fourteen Democratic-ruled states had filed suit last week contesting Musk's legal authority but District Judge Tanya Chutkan denied their emergency request to pause his actions.Musk's cost-cutting spree has been met with legal pushback on a number of fronts and a mixed bag of rulings.A judge last week lifted a freeze he had temporarily imposed on a mass buyout plan offered by the Trump administration to federal workers.According to the White House, more than 75,000 federal employees signed on to the buyout offer from the Office of Personnel Management.The fired IRS worker said he had felt ""between a rock and a hard place"" when he received the buyout offer, facing either quitting his job or being fired anyway.""For all of this to happen in such a cruel fashion, just it doesn't make sense to me,"" he said.","A US judge denies a union bid to temporarily halt the firing of thousands of federal employees.

'Those Who Harm...': Kash Patel Issues First Warning After Becoming New FBI Director | Watch

Who are the Republicans voted against Kash Patel's confirmation?



Kash Patel, Trump’s Pick for FBI Director, Is Confirmed by Senate

Who is Kash Patel?



The Senate confirmed Kash Patel , an Indian-origin FBI director , on Thursday (US time). The nominee received 51 votes in favor while 49 were against his confirmation.After the confirmation, Kash Patel took his account on X and said that his mission as Director is clear, ""let good cops be cops—and rebuild trust in the FBI.""He gave warning to those who tries to harm American, ""We will hunt you down in every corner of this planet.""Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski joined all 47 Democrats in voting no on Patel’s nomination.Earlier, Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced that she would vote against the confirmation of Kash Patel.""In this context, there is a compelling need for an FBI Director who is decidedly apolitical. While Patel has had 16 years of dedicated public service, his time over the past four years has been characterized by high profile and aggressive political activity. Patel has made numerous poltically charges statements in his book and elsewhere discrediting the work of the FBI, the very institution he has been nominated to lead. These statements, in conjunction with the questionnaire sent to thousands of FBI employees, cast doubt on Mr. Patel's ability to advance the FBI's law enforcement mission in a way that is free from the appearance of political motivation,"" Collins said in her statement.""While I strongly support efforts to ensure all federal employees perform their responsibilities ethically and in accordance with the law, Mr. Patel's recent political profile undermines his ability to serve in the apolitical role of Director of the FBI.”""Therefore, I will vote against his nomination.""Meanwhile, Alaska Sen Lisa Murkowski defended her stance and said that Kash Patel had the opportunity to push back on the administration’s decision to force the FBI to provide a list of agents involved in the January 6 investigations and prosecutions, he failed to do so.Patel, a Trump loyalist and vocal critic of the agency, would take charge during a period of significant upheaval. Recent developments include the Justice Department's removal of senior FBI officials and an unusual request for identifying thousands of agents involved in the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot investigations.As FBI directors serve 10-year terms to maintain independence, Patel replaced Christopher Wray, who resigned before Trump's return to office. Patel previously served as a federal defender and Justice Department counterterrorism prosecutor, gaining Trump's attention through his critical analysis of the FBI's Russia investigation whilst working for the House Intelligence Committee.Kash Patel, a native of Garden City, New York, was born to parents from Gujarat, India. His family's journey began in the early 1970s when they left Uganda due to ethnic discrimination and settled in Canada.

Delta Plane Crash Toronto Pilot: Who is Kendal Swanson? Why everyone thinks she was responsible for Delta flight turning upside down in Toronto,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-kendal-swanson-why-everyone-thinks-she-was-responsible-for-delta-flight-turning-upside-down-in-toronto/articleshow/118428652.cms,"The Delta aircraft turned upside down as it crash-landed on the runway.

In a shocking incident, a Delta Airlines flight turned upside down after crashing on the runway at Toronto Pearson International Airport Monday becoming the latest in a series of aviation mishaps. There was no fatality as all 80 people including the crew managed to crawl out of an upside-down plane. 21 of them were taken to hospital with injuries and by Thursday morning all of them were released.As the harrowing incident is under investigation, Delta reportedly announced a payoff of $30,000 to each of the passengers which raised suspicion as to whether the airlines want to silence the passengers. But reports claimed that taking the money will have no strings attached and the passengers can still sue the airlines for the life-threatening crash-landing.Speculations are rife on social media that the airlines has not revealed the identity of the pilots to safeguard their DEI (diversity, equity and inclusivity) hiring policies. Many viral posts indulged in a gender blame game claiming that all pilots were female -- though the gender had no link to the mishap and Delta did not release any details about the pilots -- neither their names nor gender.Kendal Swanson is the only name doing rounds on X. It has been claimed that she was the pilot of the plane but there were other pilots and the captain -- and these claims are not verified.One viral post with a photo of Kendal Swanson claimed that she was not experienced enough for the landing while the runway was covered in snow. The post said she was an instructor pilot for a small propellor aircraft a year ago and she recently received her licence. Others countered the claims and many questioned who the captain of the flight was as it was the captain's fault to give the landing to an inexperienced pilot, if the claims were true at all.According to the screenshot attached to the viral post, the PIC (pilot in command) was James and the FO (First Officer) was Kendal and the flight attendants were Hollie and Rebecca. Social media users asked if James was the captain, then it was not Kendal's fault. Delta said the pilots on that flight were very experienced.",A Delta Airlines flight turned upside down after crashing on the runway at Toronto Pearson International Airport Monday becoming the latest in a series of aviation mishaps.

At least seven passengers belonging to Pakistan’s Punjab province were shot dead late on Tuesday night in Barkhan district, in volatile southwestern Balochistan province.The incident occurred on a Balochistan-Punjab highway running through the Koh-e-Sulaiman mountain range.

Since then, the oil-rich country has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East for Europe.At least 674 migrants were reported dead and more than 1,000 missing off Libya in 2024, according to the International Organization for Migration's missing migrants project. More than 21,700 migrants were intercepted and returned to the chaos-stricken country.In 2023, the IOM reported 962 migrants dead and 1,563 missing off Libya. Around 17,200 migrants were intercepted and returned to Libya that year, it said.Those who are returned are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture - practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to UN-commissioned investigators. The abuse often accompanies attempts to extort money from the families of the imprisoned migrants before releasing them or allowing them to leave Libya on traffickers' boats to Europe.","At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya. Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his deep grief and sorrow for those lost in the capsizing. Most of the victims came from Kurram, a district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118152908,imgsize-493457,width-400,resizemode-4/118152908.jpg"
Corruption Perceptions Index: Pakistan's ranking on corruption index drops by 2 spots: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-ranking-on-corruption-index-drops-by-2-spots-report/articleshow/118143601.cms,"Pakistan's flag

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024 out of 180 countries, a media report said on Tuesday. The CPI ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption on a scale of zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean), Dawn.com reported.The CPI report is released annually by Transparency International Berlin.Transparency International Pakistan (TIP) has no role either in the collection of data or the calculation of the country's score, TIP explains.The score for Pakistan also reduced by two points from 29 in CPI 2023 to 27 in CPI 2024.According to a Transparency International document listing Pakistan's CPI ranking and scores from 1996 to 2024, which was seen by Dawn.com, the country's score in the past 10 years has ranged between 27 and 33 points (a higher score indicating less corruption).Since 2012, when the index changed to a scoring scale of 100 from 10, Pakistan's score rose from 27 to 33 in 2018 but declined consecutively back to 27 last year.Statistics from the past show that in 1996, Pakistan ranked only second-last out of 54 countries part of the index back then, with a score of 1/10.From 1997 to 2011, the country's score went back and forth, reaching as high as 2.7 in 1998 and dropping as low as 2.1 in 2004 and 2005.According to TIP chair Justice (retired) Zia Perwez, the scores of all countries in the region except Oman, China, Turkiye and Mongolia declined. The downslide for the region showed that Pakistan was one of the countries holding up against the overall trend in the region.Global corruption levels remained alarmingly high, with efforts to reduce them faltering, according to the CPI report, which exposed serious corruption levels across the globe, with more than two-thirds of countries scoring below 50 out of 100.Almost 6.8 billion people live in countries with CPI scores under 50 - equivalent to 85 per cent of the world population of 8 billion.For the seventh year in a row, Denmark obtained the highest score on the index (90) and was closely followed by Finland (88) and Singapore (84).Countries with the lowest scores were mostly fragile and conflict-affected ones like South Sudan (8), Somalia (9), Venezuela (10), Syria (12), Libya (13), Eritrea (13), Yemen (13) and Equatorial Guinea (13).While the CPI noted that the Middle East and North Africa's rising average score was a ""reason for optimism"", it pointed out that it was the first increase in over a decade and only by one point - to 39 out of 100.According to Transparency International, the top-scoring region was Western Europe and the European Union, but its score ""decreased overall for the second year in a row - many leaders are serving business interests rather than the common good and laws are often poorly enforced"".""While Asia Pacific does have a range of improving countries, its average score is decreasing, as vicious cycles of corruption and climate change impacts take their toll,"" it added.Over a quarter of the countries in the sample (47) got their lowest score yet on the index, including Austria (67), Bangladesh (23), Brazil (34), Cuba (41), France (67), Germany (75), Haiti (16), Hungary (41), Iran (23), Mexico (26), Russia (22), South Sudan (8), Switzerland (81), the United States (65) and Venezuela (10).Over the past five years, seven countries have significantly improved their scores in the index: These include Cote d'Ivoire (45), the Dominican Republic (36), Kosovo (44), Kuwait (46), the Maldives (38), Moldova (43) and Zambia (39).The global average on the index remained unchanged at 43, highlighting the need for urgent action against corruption and warning of a critical global obstacle to implementing successful climate action.",Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024. The CPI ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption. Denmark obtained the highest score on the index (90) and was closely followed by Finland (88) and Singapore (84),"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118143924,imgsize-229061,width-400,resizemode-4/118143924.jpg"

Pakistani lawyers stage protest against high-level meeting of constitutional body to pick eight SC judges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-lawyers-stage-protest-against-high-level-meeting-of-constitutional-body-to-pick-eight-sc-judges/articleshow/118118105.cms,"Representative image (Image credits: ANI)

ISLAMABAD: Hundreds of lawyers on Monday staged protests in Pakistan's national capital against a high-level meeting of a constitutional body with the agenda to appoint at least eight judges of the supreme court. The judicial commission of Pakistan (JCP) meeting was being held despite opposition by four apex court judges, the legal fraternity, resistance by opposition the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and controversy over the recent transfer of judges to the Islamabad high court (IHC), which was opposed by five IHC judges.The JCP, a top body empowered to approve judicial appointments, will finalise appointments for eight vacant supreme court judges.Lawyers gathered at various locations in Islamabad, with the lawyers' action committee staging a protest near D-Chowk. But police responded by closing several key entry points to the Red Zone, which houses key buildings, including the supreme court.Dozens of protestors gathered at Serena Chowk as they were stopped from going to the supreme court due to the closure of the Red Zone. They chanted ""Azaadi"" (freedom) and ""Lawyers' unity zindabad"" (long live lawyers' unity). They were also holding a banner written in Urdu and reading "" 26th constitutional amendment unacceptable"".Clashes were also reported between lawyers and police when they tried to enter the Red Zone. However, there was no report of any arrest or injury during the protest.The protest led to the suspension of metro bus services on multiple routes between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, causing significant inconvenience for commuters. The closure of the Red Zone has caused traffic disruptions, leading to heavy congestion on different roads in the capital.Earlier, the legal fraternity in the country was already expressing concerns against the new appointments and transfers following the controversial 26th constitutional amendment passed last year.The lawyers' representatives had held a convention at the Islamabad district courts, opposing the 26th amendment and demanding the cancellation of the JCP meeting.They also announced on February 3 to protest against the transfer of three high court judges to the IHC but it could not elicit a widespread response. The Karachi bar association had supported the strike call by staying away.Last month, the Lahore high court bar association (LHCBA) moved an application before the apex court through advocate Muhammad Waqar Rana, seeking postponement of the JCP meeting.The JCP earlier this month asked all high courts to send a list of five senior judges from each for consideration for the appointment of eight of them to the supreme court.Initially, the IHC had forwarded the names of three judges - chief justice Aamer Farooq, justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb - to the JCP because justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar did not meet the minimum requirement of five years of service.However, as justice Sarfraz Dogar was made the IHC senior puisne judge following his transfer there from the Lahore high court, his name has also been sent to the JCP.Days before justice Dogar's name was added, five judges of the IHC approached chief justice Yahya Afridi and IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq to reclaim their seniority.Separately, four SC judges, senior puisne judge justice Mansoor Ali Shah, justice Munib Akhtar, justice Ayesha Malik and justice Athar Minallah, in a letter to the chief justice showed concerns last week and are also seeking the postponement of today's JCP session until a decision is made on the petitions against the 26th Amendment.The opposition PTI party in a letter to the chief justice on Sunday asked to postpone the commission's meeting.The 13-member JCP is led by the chief justice and includes four judges of the apex court, as well as parliamentarians from both the treasury and opposition and others.The lawyers and opposition allege that the government was trying to 'pack' the top judiciary with hand-picked judges to influence the fate of political cases, a concern rejected by the government.","Hundreds of lawyers stage protests in Islamabad against high-level meeting of constitutional body.

Notably, all the acquittals were made after Muhammad Yunus took charge of the interim govt after Sheikh Hasina's govt was overthrown by violent student-led protests.The verdict also clears her path to enter elections, likely in Dec, with a clean slate. She is in London for medical treatment.Judge Md Rabiul Alam delivered the ruling, stating that the prosecution failed to prove the charges against Khaleda and the other accused; hence, all were acquitted. The ACC originally filed the case on Dec 9, 2007, alleging that Khaleda and others had abused their power to grant Niko, a Canadian oil and gas exploration company, an illegal deal while she was PM from 2001 to 2006. Charges were officially pressed on May 5, 2008, against Khaleda and 10 others.","Khaleda Zia has now been acquitted of all corruption cases filed against her, including those related to the Zia Orphanage Trust and Zia Charitable Trust.

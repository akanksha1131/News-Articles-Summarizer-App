Donald Trump's environmental rollback: Provides regulatory relief to coal-fired plants; reverses Biden era rules to 'national security',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trumps-environmental-rollback-provides-regulatory-relief-to-coal-fired-plants-reverses-biden-era-rules-to-national-security/articleshow/122714749.cms,"US President Donald Trump is planning to reverse environmental regulations introduced during the Biden administration, announcing two years of regulatory relief for coal-fired power plants, chemical manufacturers and other industrial polluters.The decision, framed as a national security measure, was revealed through a series of presidential proclamations issued late on Thursday.The exemptions apply to a broad range of facilities, including taconite iron ore processors critical to steel production, and chemical manufacturers involved in making semiconductors and sterilising medical devices. These industries will now be permitted to comply with older Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards that were in effect prior to the Biden-era rules, the White House confirmed.Trump criticised the regulations imposed under President Joe Biden as prohibitively expensive and, in some cases, impossible to meet. A White House fact sheet claimed the exemptions would allow “critical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs.”During his previous term, Trump’s EPA had already granted waivers to numerous coal-fired plants, citing similar reasons.The agency also gave polluting industries a chance to apply for relief from rules aimed at limiting emissions of hazardous chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene. To streamline the process, the EPA introduced a dedicated email system that companies could use to seek presidential exemptions under the Clean Air Act.Environmental groups have strongly condemned the move, branding the new EPA contact point a “polluters’ portal” that could enable widespread avoidance of environmental laws. Advocates warned of the dangers associated with exposure to toxic substances, especially mercury, which can lead to brain damage in children and birth defects in unborn babies.Industry associations representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical firms quickly mobilised to request blanket exemptions from federal pollution controls. Under the Clean Air Act, the president has authority to grant such temporary exemptions if required technologies are not broadly available and the exemptions serve national security interests.Back in April, the EPA granted 70 coal-fired plants a two-year reprieve from federal mandates targeting toxic emissions. According to a list published on the agency’s website, 47 power providers operating at least 66 coal plants have already received exemptions from Biden-era regulations.In a broader push, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in March an ambitious plan to repeal dozens of major environmental regulations covering air, water and climate protections. Zeldin hailed the move as the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.”However, news agency AP warned of the potential consequences. as the targeted regulations could have prevented an estimated 30,000 deaths and saved $275 billion annually.“Today’s actions provide much needed regulatory relief for the power sector and help ... unleash American energy,"" Zeldin said.","US President Donald Trump is planning to reverse environmental regulations introduced during the Biden administration.

'Nothing to do with it': Trump ducks question on appointing special prosecutor to Epstein case; White House press sec doubles down on denial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nothing-to-do-with-it-trump-ducks-question-on-appointing-special-prosecutor-to-epstein-case-white-house-press-sec-doubles-down-on-denial/articleshow/122710862.cms,"White House Press Secretary Karoline Leviatt and President Donald Trump (AP image)

Trump Battling THIS Chronic Disease After Months of Online Speculation, Official Report Drops





President Donald Trump on Wednesday sidestepped a direct question about whether he would appoint a special counsel to investigate the Jeffrey Epstein case, saying, “I have nothing to do with it,” according to CNN.The following day, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reinforced Trump’s position, telling reporters that the president does not support appointing a special prosecutor in the matter, despite mounting pressure from some Republican leaders.“The president would not recommend a special prosecutor in the Epstein case. That’s how he feels,” Leavitt said during a White House press briefing on Thursday (local time). She added that she was “not sure” whether Trump had discussed the idea of a special counsel with Attorney General Pam Bondi.The power to appoint a special counsel lies with the attorney general and the department of justice, which generally functions independently of the White House to safeguard against political interference.However, Trump has often disregarded this practice. He has previously called for investigations into his political opponents.In March, during a speech at the department, he proclaimed himself as the “chief law enforcement officer in our country”, a title usually reserved for the attorney general.In contrast, Trump has taken a more cautious public approach regarding the Epstein investigation. He has stated that it is up to Attorney General Bondi to release any credible information related to the case. When asked on Thursday whether Trump would order the release of all Epstein-related files, Leavitt responded that the matter was “out of the president’s control.” She also said she was not aware of whether Trump had been briefed by Bondi on any unreleased details.“Not to my knowledge, and that’s a question for the attorney general,” Leavitt said.Last week, the department of justice released an unsigned memo stating there was no evidence that Epstein maintained a “client list” or that he was murdered. This announcement angered many of Trump’s supporters, particularly after Bondi had previously hinted that such a list existed. She later clarified that she had been referring to other documents related to the investigation.Despite the DOJ’s statement, public skepticism has grown, especially among Trump’s base, with increasing demands for transparency. On Wednesday, Trump dismissed ongoing concerns about the case, describing those focused on the Epstein files as “weaklings” who have fallen for a “hoax.”Some of Trump’s allies have publicly disagreed with the administration’s stance. Trump’s aide Laura Loomer told Politico that a special counsel should be appointed to independently investigate the handling of the Epstein files. She also criticized Bondi for lacking transparency and for not handling the issue effectively.Republican Lauren Boebert also called for a special counsel. In an interview with podcaster Benny Johnson she said, “I think moving forward, we need a special counsel. That has got to happen. There has to be a special investigation into this if we aren’t going to be provided information.”In an interview with John Solomon that aired Wednesday, Trump linked the Epstein case to other investigations that have targeted him. He said the FBI could examine all of them together.“I think they could look at all of it. It’s all the same scam. They could look at this Jeffrey Epstein hoax also, because that’s the same stuff,” Trump said.","White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday that the president does not support appointing a special prosecutor in the Epstein case.

Austrian sportsman Felix Baumgartner, 56, also known as “fearless Felix” has lost his life in a paragliding accident in Italy, as per local media.Baumgartner reportedly was feeling unwell before takeoff and lost control of his aircraft on Thursday around 4.00 pm (local time) in Porto Sant'Elpidio, Marche. He reportedly crashed the craft into a hotel swimming pool, reports the New York Post.A woman was also injured in the incident after being hit by Baumgartner as he fell to the ground. She was transported to Murri Hospital, though initial reports indicate her injuries are not serious.Baumgartner departed from Fermo, but while flying along the coast, he lost control of the powered hang glider for reasons still under investigation. Following the crash, he lost consciousness and went into cardiac arrest, reports the Daily Mail.Emergency responders called for an air ambulance to transport him to the Torrette Hospital, in Ancona but he was pronounced dead at the scene.Around two hours before the deadly crash he posted a story on his Instagram that read “too much wind.”“Our community is deeply affected by the tragic disappearance of Felix Baumgartner, a figure of global prominence, a symbol of courage and passion for extreme flight,"" said the city's mayor Massimiliano Ciarpella, through a social media post.Baumgartner’s daring jump in 2012 from a capsule over 39 kilometres (24 miles) above Earth cemented his place in the record books as an extreme adventurer. Baumgartner achieved the fastest freefall on record, reaching a top speed of 1,357.6 kilometers (843.6 miles) per hour after jumping from the capsule, reports AFP.He set a world record in 1999 for the highest parachute jump from a building by leaping off the 1,483-foot-tall Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.He also became the first person to skydive across the English Channel in 2003.""I always had the desire to be in the air,"" Austrian media quoted him saying.

Indian-origin physician Sanjay Mehta pleads guilty to illegally prescribing opioids that killed two in US; had little to no experience,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-physician-sanjay-mehta-pleads-guilty-to-illegally-prescribing-opioids-that-killed-two-in-us-had-little-to-no-experience/articleshow/122585373.cms,"Indian-origin physician pleads guilty to federal drug crime.

An Indian-origin physician, Sanjay Mehta, pleaded guilty to unlawfully prescribing opioids, including to two poeple who fatally overdosed. He admitted that he procured the opioids by fraud. The 57-year-old man from West Virginia's Shady Spring pleaded guilty to three counts of obtaining a controlled substance by fraud after he admitted to unlawfully prescribing opioids while working at HOPE Clinic, a pain management clinic, according to a news release from the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of West Virginia.Prosecutors said Mehta worked at multiple sites that the pain management clinic operated from November 2012 through May 2015 though he had “little to no experience in dealing with chronic pain patients and no training in prescribing Schedule II narcotics.”Mehta admitted to writing prescriptions for three different customers with no legitimate medical purpose, including prescriptions for oxycodone, methadone and Roxicodone. Prosecutors said two of the three patients died of opioid intoxication within days of receiving their prescriptions.Mehta is scheduled to be sentenced on October 31 and faces a maximum of four years in prison, up to three years of supervised release and a maximum $750,000 fine.He also agreed to surrender his Drug Enforcement Administration Certificate of Registration, not oppose the revocation of his registration to dispense controlled substances and not apply for re-registration.Mehta was initially indicted in 2018 along with others associated with HOPE Clinic and Patients, Physicians and Pharmacists Fighting Diversion, which managed HOPE Clinic’s daily operations. According to the indictment, from November 2010 to June 2015, Mehta and his associatesconspired to distribute oxycodone and other Schedule II controlled substances outside the usual course of professional practice.Mehta and six other physicians pleaded guilty to separate charges in lieu of the indictment. PPPFD owner-operator Mark T. Radcliffe, 68, of Shady Spring and co-defendant Michael T. Moran, 60, of Covington, Virginia, are scheduled for trial on Oct. 6, 2025.HOPE Clinic operated in Beckley, Beaver and Charleston, West Virginia, and Wytheville, Virginia.“It is readily evident that the Southern District of West Virginia has been severely impacted by the opioid crisis.

‘Most consequential 3 seconds’: Ex-Alaska Airlines pilot recalls attempting to shut off flight’s engine mid-air; feared fatal end,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/most-consequential-3-seconds-ex-alaska-airlines-pilot-recalls-attempting-to-shut-off-flights-engine-mid-air-feared-fatal-end/articleshow/122691296.cms,"ANI file photo





Former Alaska Airlines pilot Joseph Emerson, recalls the most “consequential three seconds” of his life when he had pulled down levers that could cut off fuel to the engines in an Alaska Air Flight 2059, reports CBS News. He had reportedly been under the influence of “magic mushrooms” and lost sense of reality.Emerson boarded the flight bound for San Francisco as a passenger from Everett, Washington with 83 other passengers and crew on board. He was assigned the cockpit jump seat located behind the pilot and first officer.""I had no intention of crashing an actual airplane. I wanted to wake up. I was convinced I wasn't going home to my wife and kids,"" he said in an interview with CBS News on Thursday.At that time he was grieving the death of his best friend and reportedly experimented with the psychedelic drug.""You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,"" he said recalling the incident. ""I mean, in the dream, in that dissociative state, I thought they were going to wake me up. It didn't wake me up, right? I was in reality. I know that now. You know, it's the most consequential three seconds of my life.”""I know what those levers do in a real airplane and I need to wake up from this. You know, it's 30 seconds of my life that I wish I could change, and I can't,” he was quoted saying by ABC News.The flight was diverted and landed safely in Portland, Oregon, where Emerson was taken into custody. He is scheduled to face trial next month on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew, and also faces numerous state charges, including 83 misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment and one felony count of first-degree endangering an aircraft, reported CBS News.Since then the National Transportation Safety Board has since hosted a first-of-its-kind forum focused on pilot mental health to examine current regulations.The FAA launched its own policy review, with both agencies advocating for reforms to remove barriers to mental health care.""Our pilots and air traffic controllers are not going to lose their job when they ask for help. We in this country must recognize that that's strength. And they're not to be punished. We're going to help them, process them, and get them back into cockpits,"" said Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber, reported CBS News.Illinois Rep. Sean Casten and Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber are spearheading a bipartisan push in Congress to implement reforms within two years through the Mental Health in Aviation Act.

Who is Maurene Comey?





The US justice department has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of the former FBI director James Comey, on Wednesday. The reason for her firing was not immediately clear.Comey had worked on several high-profile cases, including the prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein as well as rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs.Reacting to the firing, Maurene Comey said there was no reason behind her dismissal. “Yesterday was unexpectedly my last day in the Office. I was summarily fired via memo from Main Justice that did not give a reason for my termination,” she wrote in an email to colleagues, reported the New York Post.This comes as the administration is embroiled in a controversy after closing the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.Maurene Comey was a seasoned attorney in the Southern District of New York, widely regarded as one of the Justice Department's most prestigious prosecutorial offices.She famously worked on the prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein, who died in custody in 2019, as he was awaiting trial.Comey achieved significant success in several high-profile prosecutions, most notably securing the conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell on sex trafficking charges for assisting financier Jeffrey Epstein in the abuse of underage girls.In a declaration submitted in January, Comey argued that releasing documents on the Epstein case could harm the government’s position on a potential retrial of Maxwell. She said that making the materials public might expose witnesses “to possible embarrassment and harassment” potentially discouraging them from testifying, as per the New York Times.Most recently, Comey led the prosecution of Sean “Diddy” Combs. The trial against Combs ended in a split verdict and he was convicted on prostitution related charges but acquitted of more serious charges.In recent months, Comey came under repeated attacks from Trump’s right-wing base, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist, who urged attorney general Pam Bondi to fire her in May.","Maurene Comey, the daughter of former FBI director James Comey, was fired on Wednesday.

New video shows Travis Decker 3 days before he allegedly killed his daughters





Newly acquired video footage from the Wenatchee police department shows Travis Decker, 32, the fugitive father, accused of killing his three young daughters, just days before their disappearance.The footage captures Decker speaking with a police officer and another individual on May 27. Decker rear-ended another vehicle at a red light, and the second person in the video was the driver of that car, reported CBS News.In the nearly 20-minute-long video, Decker and the other person were seen speaking to each other and the officer. Towards the end of the video, Decker and the other driver shook hands before returning to their respective vehicles. The audio could not be intercepted from the clip.The driver whose car Decker had hit said that he was “nervous and fidgety” and kept on asking him to “not call the police,” as per KING 5. “I could tell he was not in his full senses,” the driver added.Travis Decker has been the subject of an intense manhunt since June 2 after officials found the bodies of three of his daughters, Paityn (9), Evelyn (8), and Olivia (5), at a campground near Leavenworth, Washington State.The girls were on a “planned visitation” with Decker on May 30. Decker’s vehicle was found abandoned near the girls’ bodies and officials announced that the bloody handprints on the truck’s tailgate matched the DNA profile of Decker's.As per court records, Decker’s ex-wife raised concerns over his mental health, highlighting that he became increasingly unstable and was often living out of his truck. She also mentioned that he had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder but was not under any medication.Decker served in the US Army from 2013 to 2021, including a deployment to Afghanistan in 2014, and received training in navigation, survival, and wilderness skills. Police stated that he is currently wanted on three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of kidnapping.A probable cause affidavit revealed that Decker fled the scene of a different crash on May 4, although the other driver declined police follow-up since their vehicle was undamaged.","New video shows Travis Decker 3 days before he allegedly killed his daughters.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Asim Munir for President? Pakistan Defence Minister Denies Amid Buzz Of Asif Ali Zardari Quitting





A political and diplomatic dogfight is underway over a prospective visit to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump en route to the Quad summit in India in September amid a gradual recalibration of ties in the region.Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit after pulling off a coup by arranging a luncheon meeting last month for the country's army chief Asim Munir with the US President.Munir charmed Trump by endorsing him for a Nobel Peace Prize, playing up to his craving for one, and the Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits, despite having thrown itself at China's feet for survival.Although the White House has not confirmed Trump's Quad attendance given New Delhi is yet to nail the dates -- which also depends on the leaders of Japan and Australia -- Pakistan's excitable media broadcast that the US President would visit Pakistan on September 18, before retracting the report because Trump will be on a state visit to the UK from September 17-19.There are indications though that Trump may stopover in Pakistan whenever he heads out to the Quad summit.This could be as late as November given the MAGA supremo's obsession with trade deals over strategic alignments. He has just delivered a tariff shock to Japan and also riled up Australia, while India has proved to be a tough negotiator, frustrating his trade boffins attempts to strong-arm New Delhi into a quick deal.In fact, Trump's fetish for tariffs and his fixation on trade deals puts a question mark over the strategic salience of the Quad even as long-time allies and partners adjust to his mercurial approach.According to some diplomats, India itself may have to reassess its approach to Trump-era Washington after a rosy-eyed view of long-term strategic ties with the US. They acknowledge that Trump’s response during his second term to the Pakistani outreach – driven more by opportunism than any strategic vision – clearly caught India off guard. New Delhi resents the re-hyphenation that would be implicit in such a two-fer, but has no way of thwarting it.If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades after George W Bush layover in 2006. Bush stopped by in Islamabad for a few hours under a tight security blanket on his way back from a three-day visit to New Delhi, talking up counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan while rejecting its pleas for a nuclear deal similar to the one he forged with India.Presidents Obama and Biden both disdained even a stopover while Trump himself trashed Pakistan during his first term, accusing it of ""nothing but lies & deceit"" and providing ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.""Pakistan is now promising to turn itself into a safe haven for US businesses promoted by Trump associates -- including transforming Islamabad into the ""crypto capital of South Asia"" and a ""global leader in the digital finance revolution,’ -- to land a Presidential visit.During his first term, Trump is famously said to have complained about landing in Iraq and Afghanistan with the lights on Air Force One turned off (as a security measure), despite the US having spent billions on the countries. If the Pakistan stopover comes through, he may well insist on landing in full sight – to soak up the fanfare and flattery.","Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit.

Baloch Rebels Launch ‘Operation Baam’; 17 Attacks Rock Pakistan’s Balochistan Province





Over the past two days, Baloch insurgent groups have claimed responsibility for a string of deadly attacks on Pakistani military forces in Balochistan, reportedly killing at least 27 soldiers, according to The Balochistan Post.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) said its Fateh Squad targeted a military transport bus in Kalat’s Nimargh Cross area, killing 27 troops and injuring several others.The bus was reportedly ferrying personnel from Karachi to Quetta. BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch stated that civilians, including qawwali performers on board, were not intended targets, though Dawn reported three civilian deaths, including two qawwals.In another incident, the BLA claimed to have killed two soldiers and injured seven with a remote-controlled IED in Quetta’s Hazarganji area.The Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) also announced two separate operations. On Tuesday, it said an IED blast in Kalat’s Khazina area killed four soldiers. On Wednesday, it claimed to have ambushed a military unit in Awaran’s Gujro Kor area, killing six, including Major Syed Rab Nawaz Tariq from Muzaffarabad.Later, a sniper unit fired upon a nearby military convoy, forcing a retreatThe BLF denied state media reports that three of its ""fighters"" were killed, alleging that Pakistani forces may have staged fake encounters.Balochistan has witnessed a decades-long insurgency by separatist groups seeking independence from Pakistan, with Islamabad claiming the rebellion has been largely suppressed -- a claim challenged by continued militant violence.","Baloch insurgent groups have claimed responsibility for a string of deadly attacks on Pakistani military forces.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Monday it was creating a national paramilitary force, prompting concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force that will be called the Federal Constabulary, state minister for the interior Talal Chaudhry told a press conference in the eastern city of Faisalabad. Its new duties will include internal security, riot control and counter-terrorism, according to a copy of the amended law reported by the local Dunya News TV.The announcement came after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former jailed PM Imran Khan said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of his arrest. Several such protests since his Aug 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.“This will be a new force. This will be a stronger force. We need this force for internal security,” Chaudhry said, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had already approved amendments in the law introducing changes in the paramilitary force.The new force replaces the Frontier Constabulary (FC), whose cadres were previously recruited only from tribes in the northwestern province, Chaudhry said.Training of the new force will bring it into line with other national law enforcement agencies, he added. Khan’s party spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters,” he said. His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body. “We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.REUTERS","The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force.

Poliovirus found in 20 Pakistani districts amid rising vaccine refusals: New sewage data signals resurgence; 13th polio case confirmed in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/poliovirus-found-in-20-pakistani-districts-amid-rising-vaccine-refusals-new-sewage-data-signals-resurgence-13th-polio-case-confirmed-in-2025/articleshow/122421011.cms,"



Pakistan's battle against polio has hit a fresh setback, with the deadly virus detected in sewage samples across 20 districts, including the capital, just as the country grapples with rising vaccine refusal rates.According to ARY News, citing the National Reference Laboratory, 28 sewage samples collected between May 8 and June 17 tested positive for Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1). The presence of the virus was confirmed in major urban centres such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, as well as in districts across Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts. Lahore recorded three cases, while Islamabad and four districts in KP also registered positive samples. In Balochistan, the virus was found in Mastung, Khuzdar, and Sibi. Mirpur in PoJK also showed signs of the virus.This alarming development follows Pakistan’s second national polio vaccination drive earlier this year, which saw over 60,000 refusals, 39,000 of them in Karachi alone. These refusals, officials say, are now posing a major roadblock to the country’s eradication efforts.“We’re not just fighting a virus; we’re battling misinformation and mistrust,” a senior health official told ARY News.Pakistan remains one of only two countries where polio is still endemic, the other being Afghanistan. With the confirmation of another new case this week, the total number of polio cases in the country has reached 13 so far in 2025.Health experts warn that the virus spreads primarily through contaminated water or food and can cause paralysis or death. There is no cure for polio, making vaccination the only defense. The World Health Organisation emphasises that multiple oral doses are needed to protect children under five, the group most vulnerable to the disease.Despite ongoing national campaigns, large pockets in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain difficult to access for vaccination teams, leaving thousands of children at risk.As the virus resurfaces in urban and rural sewers alike, officials say the next phase in Pakistan’s anti-polio war must tackle both the virus, and vaccine hesitancy, with equal urgency.","Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts.

Pakistan’s economic performance under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) $7 billion loan programme has been “strong so far”, according to Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, reported PTI.Speaking at a lecture hosted by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad on Sunday, Binici said Pakistan’s first review under the three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF), approved in July 2024, was successfully completed by the IMF Executive Board in May.The EFF aims to cement macroeconomic stability and lay the groundwork for “stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth,” he said. So far, Pakistan has received two instalments under the programme, with the government implementing agreed policy measures aimed at fiscal discipline and investor confidence.“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici noted.He stressed the importance of structural reforms to ensure long-term economic sustainability, including strengthening tax equity, improving the business climate, and encouraging private-sector-led investment.Binici also welcomed Pakistan’s commitment to climate-related reforms under the $1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), approved in March.The RSF supports projects focused on disaster preparedness, efficient water use, green investments, and better climate data transparency.“Support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory,” he said.On regional prospects, Binici said economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Pakistan, was expected to improve in 2025 and beyond. However, he warned that global economic uncertainty remains high due to trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation, and weakening cooperation.","Pakistan's economic performance under IMF's $7 billion loan programme has been'strong so far' Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, spoke at a lecture in Islamabad.

A protest over a prolonged power outage in Karachi’s Punjab Colony spiraled into city-wide traffic chaos on Saturday, underscoring what many see as chronic governance failure and energy mismanagement in Pakistan, Dawn reported.Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity. Power had reportedly been out since 11 am Friday, and despite repeated complaints, K-Electric, Karachi’s sole power distributor, allegedly failed to respond.The resulting sit-in crippled traffic on Defence Road and nearby areas. Long queues of trucks and tankers vital to Karachi Port were stalled from Qayyumabad to the KPT Flyover. Major intersections like Boat Basin, Gizri, and Hino Chowrangi were brought to a standstill, leaving thousands of commuters stranded, according to Dawn.The outage reportedly followed K-Electric’s anti-theft operation in the adjacent P&T Colony. Protesters claimed legal connections were also cut off in the sweep, with no clear procedure followed. KE, however, described the protestors as ""miscreants"" attempting to restore illegal connections and said their teams were attacked during the operation, allegedly linked to a cable TV network.No evidence was provided implicating all affected residents in theft.While KE later claimed to have restored power to parts of the area, the larger issue remains unresolved. The incident highlights Pakistan’s ongoing struggle to provide reliable electricity, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and lack of accountability in power distribution.As Dawn noted, the crisis is less about one blackout and more a reflection of systemic dysfunction, where citizens bear the brunt of institutional failure.","Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity.

PESHAWAR: An under-construction government primary school for girls in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast by unknown militants, police said on Friday.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time of the explosion.Militants had planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel police jurisdiction of Bannu district.The device was detonated with a powerful blast, causing substantial structural damage to the building.An FIR has been registered and forensic teams have been deployed to collect evidence from the blast site, police said.Authorities have condemned the attack as an attempt to derail educational development in the region.According to a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls' schools have been destroyed in the tribal areas between 2007 to 2017, with teachers and young students also targeted.Before an all-out military operation launched by Pakistan's security forces in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) carried out hundreds of attacks on girls' schools in the tribal areas and settled districts of the northwestern province from its stronghold in Swat district.After the crackdown, TTP militants fled to Afghanistan and began to orchestrate cross border attacks from their new sanctuaries.The Taliban takeover of Kabul has emboldened the TTP, which is fighting to regain control of its strongholds in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Since the takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and banned women from universities.Pakistani Taliban, who are ideologically closer to Afghan Taliban, are trying to enforce a similar anti-education and theocratic agenda in Pakistan's tribal areas by force.The youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, who is from Swat district, was shot in the face when she was 14 by TTP gunmen in 2012 as she wanted to pursue her education.","Militants planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School.

In a disturbing case, Pakistani actress and model Humaira Asghar Ali was found dead in her Karachi apartment, with forensic experts saying she likely died between eight to ten months ago.Her body was discovered last week by a police team executing a court order to vacate the flat.According to Geo News, which cited the initial post-mortem findings, the body was in an “advanced stage of decomposition.” Facial muscles had deteriorated, fingers and nails were reduced to bone, and large parts of the body had no muscle tissue left. The bones reportedly began to fall apart when touched.Humaira had acted in several television serials and two films. She lived alone in an apartment in the upscale Defence Housing Society.The report also said that her internal organs had turned into a “black-coloured mass” and brain matter was entirely decomposed due to autolysis. Cartilage in the joints was gone, though no bone fractures were found. While the head and spine remained intact, the spinal cord was missing. Brown-coloured insects were reportedly present, especially in the hair, but no maggots were found.Because of the severe state of decay, experts were unable to determine the exact cause of death at this stage. However, DNA profiling and toxicology tests are underway and are expected to offer further insight.Initially, police said that her family refused to take the body. “Her family members have flatly refused to own her or take the body for burial,” DIG South Zone Asad Reza said, adding they claimed to have severed all ties with her two years ago. He said the case posed unusual challenges, especially since her death had gone unnoticed for such a long time and no neighbours appeared to have raised any concerns.Geo News later confirmed that her family received the remains on Thursday and transported them to Lahore by ambulance.","Pakistani actress and model Humaira Asghar Ali was found dead in her Karachi apartment.

At least four people were killed on Wednesday in Bangladesh during violent clashes in Dhaka's Gopalganj district between Awami League members, police, and the army, reported ANI citing local media.The violence erupted when leaders of the newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) attempted to hold a rally in the southern district, which is also the hometown of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina interThe NCP, formed by youth leaders of last year’s mass uprising, has faced strong opposition in Gopalganj. As the party’s central leaders arrived for the rally, they were reportedly attacked by Awami League leaders and workers. The situation quickly escalated into a full-blown clash involving the police and army, who used live ammunition and tear gas to disperse the crowds.The violence began around noon local time and continued until the evening. Awami League members allegedly vandalised the rally venue, setting fire to the stage and audience chairs. The area turned into a virtual battlefield, with live television footage showing tear gas clouds and sounds of gunfire and explosions.NCP leaders were eventually taken into protective custody by police.A curfew was imposed in Gopalganj from 8 pm Wednesday until 6 pm the next day to restore order.Rumors had spread the night before that the NCP planned to demolish the mausoleum of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of Bangladesh, further fueling tensions. The NCP had earlier vowed to claim Gopalganj politically, but the day’s violence left its leaders under police protection instead.The interim government, led by Muhammad Yunus issued a strong condemnation of the attacks. ""The use of violence today in Gopalganj is utterly indefensible. Preventing young citizens from peacefully holding a rally to commemorate the one-year anniversary of their revolutionary movement is a shameful violation of their fundamental rights"", the statement read.“The perpetrators must be swiftly identified and held fully accountable. There is no place for such violence against any citizen of Bangladesh,” it added. It praised the army and police for their intervention and commended the resilience of the students and citizens who continued the rally despite threats.The government vowed justice, declaring that ""violence has no place in our nation"" and promising that those responsible for the brutality would be brought to justice.","Violence erupted when leaders of the newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) attempted to hold a rally in the southern district.

DHAKA: In yet another development showcasing growing social intolerance in Bangladesh, the ancestral home of iconic filmmaker Satyajit Ray in Dhaka is being demolished to make way for a new semi-concrete structure, the local media reported Tuesday.Located on Horikishore Ray Chowdhury Road in the city, the century-old house was home to Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury. Upendrakishore, a prominent 19th-century litterateur in his own right besides being a painter and publisher, was the father of celebrated poet Sukumar Ray and grandfather of filmmaker Satyajit Ray.A semi-concrete structure with several rooms will be built to house a Shishu Academy at the historically-significant building, the country's leading media outlet 'Daily Star' reported. According to reports, the property - which was built by Upendrakishore more than a century ago and previously housed the Mymensingh Shishu Academy - fell into a state of disrepair after years of neglect by the authorities.The newspaper said that local residents have expressed their concerns over the decision, citing that the demolition will wipe out the legacy of the Ray dynasty in Mymensingh city. However, the authorities insist that the demolition is being carried out in accordance with proper procedures and ""necessary approvals"".Officials from Dhaka's Department of Archeology, while agreeing that the property remains an archeological heritage, admitted that their repeated requests to protect the building have gone unheard.Expressing her anguish, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee posted on X: ""The Ray family is one of the most prominent torchbearers of Bengal's culture. Upendrakishore was among the pillars of the Bengal Renaissance. I feel this house is inextricably linked to Bengal's cultural history. I appeal to the Bangladeshi government and to all right-thinking people of that country to preserve this edifice of rich tradition. The Indian government should also intervene.""In New Delhi, MEA expressed deep regret that the property was being demolished.

PHNOM PENH: Cambodia's military will begin conscripting civilians next year, Prime Minister Hun Manet said Monday, citing rising tensions with Thailand as the reason for activating a long-dormant mandatory enlistment law.Cambodia's parliament in 2006 approved a law that would require all Cambodians aged 18 to 30 to serve in the military for 18 months, although it has never been enforced.Relations with neighbouring Thailand have been tense since May, when a long-standing territorial dispute boiled over into cross-border clashes, killing one Cambodian soldier.""This episode of confrontation is a lesson for us and is an opportunity for us to review, assess, and set our targets to reform our military,"" Hun Manet said.""From 2026, the military conscription law will be implemented,"" he told a ceremony at the Royal Gendarmerie Training Centre in central Kampong Chhnang province.Hun Manet said the service period would be extended from the 18 months outlined in the legislation passed two decades ago to 24 months, and pledged to ""look at increasing"" Cambodia's defence budget.""Our national defence, the building of our military, is not to invade anybody's territory but it is to protect our territory,"" he added.The Cambodian soldier was killed by Thai troops in a firefight in a disputed area known as the Emerald Triangle, where the borders of both countries and Laos meet.The incident soured relations between Phnom Penh and Bangkok -- causing the closure of border crossings as Cambodia banned fuel and gas imports from Thailand.It also caused a domestic political crisis in Thailand, where Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has been suspended from office pending an ethics probe over her conduct during the row.A diplomatic call between Paeotongtarn and Hun Manet's father, former leader Hun Sen, was leaked from the Cambodian side, sparking a judicial investigation.Neighbouring Thailand already has military conscription for young and able-bodied men, who enter a lottery to determine whether they have to serve.","Cambodia's parliament in 2006 approved a law that would require all Cambodians aged 18 to 30 to serve in the military for 18 months.

The voting age will be lowered to 16 across the UK in time for the next general election, govt has confirmed, bringing UK-wide elections in line with Scotland and Wales.Around 1.5 million 16- and 17-year-olds will be eligible to vote in all UK elections once the elections bill becomes law. Currently the voting age for the general election is 18.Announcing the change, deputy prime minister Angela Rayner said: “Unlike our opponents, this Labour govt is not running scared of a generation that’s hungry for change.”Among other changes announced in the strategy paper, British voters will be able to use UK-issued bank cards as ID to vote at polling stations. Currently they are only allowed to use photo ID such as passports and driving licences.A clampdown on foreign donations has also been promised, by requiring that donations from British companies giving to political parties are carrying out genuine commercial activity and the recipients will be responsible for checking there is no foreign interference. In addition tougher sentences will be brought out for anyone who harasses and threatens candidates.The changes came under fire from the Conservatives and Reform UK.Tory MP James Cleverly said Labour had only done this because they were “tanking in the polls”.Shadow communities minister Paul Holmes MP said: “Sixteen-year-olds will be able to vote in an election but not stand as candidates, and they will be able to vote but not permitted to buy a lottery ticket, consume alcohol, marry, or go to war.”Leader of Reform UK Nigel Farage said allowing bank cards as voter ID was “allowing wide-open fraud”. “Reform is in second place with this age group, so if this is what is going to happen we are going to give Labour the shock of their lives,” he said.Minister for democracy Rushanara Ali said: “Young people can work at 16, pay taxes and join the Army. There is no reason that they should not have the right to a say in who represents them. They are passionate about the issues affecting their communities and country; foreign interference in British politics is a growing danger to our democracy and it is right that we tackle it.”",Around 1.5 million 16- and 17-year-olds will be eligible to vote in all UK elections.

More than 100 British officials, including MI6 spies, SAS soldiers, MPs and government ministers, were among those exposed in a major data breach linked to Afghan evacuation efforts, The Independent has reported.The breach occurred in February 2022, when a ministry of defence (MoD) official mistakenly shared sensitive information. It included the personal details of thousands of Afghans who had applied to relocate to the UK, fearing Taliban reprisal due to their ties with British forces.The gravity of the incident led to an unprecedented two-year superinjunction, banning media coverage of the breach. But new court disclosures lifting the ban on media now reveal that British intelligence and special forces personnel were also caught in the leak.The Intelligence and security committee, a powerful parliamentary body, has criticised the secrecy. Its chair, Lord Beamish, said there was “no justification” for withholding intelligence assessments used to justify the gag order and demanded they be handed over immediately.Former armed forces minister James Heappey, who was in office at the time, called the discovery “gut-wrenching”. He added that while the MoD official responsible was well-intentioned, the error had severe consequences. He also questioned the credibility of advice he received regarding former Afghan special forces – known as the Triples – who were denied UK entry despite fighting alongside British troops.","The breach occurred in February 2022, when a ministry of defence official mistakenly shared sensitive information.

The clip and its timing



Meghan Markle Gets A Warning For 'As Ever' After Lifestyle Brand Declares Successful Launch

A busy birthday at the palace

Signs of warmer weather

Why a crate of wine matters

The brand behind the bottle

What happens next





Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, chose a simple Instagram Story to mark July 17. In a short clip she opened a wooden crate holding three bottles of her own As Ever rosé, then wrote, “Sending birthday love (both near and far) to my ladies. ” The post went up just hours after Queen Camilla turned 78, so royal watchers quickly linked the message to the day’s celebrations.The video showed only Meghan’s hands, a small bunch of peonies and the pale-pink wine. Nothing named Camilla, yet the timing caught notice because Camilla is indeed “far,” while many of Meghan’s close friends are in California and could count as “near.” As Ever bottles sell out fast online, so the gift looks personal rather than promotional.Buckingham Palace marked the Queen’s birthday with a new portrait taken in her Wiltshire garden. One day earlier King Charles granted her the honorary title of Vice Admiral of the United Kingdom, making her the first woman to hold the role. The naval appointment arrived on what many called an early birthday present from the King.The Sussexes remain estranged from much of the family, yet aides for Prince Harry and King Charles held quiet “peace talks” last week.Sources say the goal was to cool public disputes, not to negotiate a return to royal duties. Prince William’s advisors skipped the meeting, showing that divisions still run deep. Even so, insiders believe Harry may see his father in September when he travels to the UK for WellChild events.Royal historian Sarah Gristwood notes that small gestures often carry extra weight in strained relationships. A discreet gift lets both sides keep dignity while signalling goodwill. Fans on X echoed that view, flooding the Queen’s portrait with heart emojis and toasting the chance of détente.As Ever is Meghan’s lifestyle label, rebranded this year from American Riviera Orchard. The rosé is made with Napa grapes in partnership with Fairwinds Estate. Early brand launches (jams) shipped in small numbered batches to friends and influencers; the rosé was sold publicly in 3‑bottle sets that sold out quickly.Neither Buckingham Palace nor Archewell commented on the post. Royal aides often let social media chatter run its course, and there is no rule against members exchanging private gifts. Still, observers will watch to see whether Camilla answers with a public thank-you or whether the moment fades quietly. For now, a few bottles of rosé and five short words have done more to stir speculation than any official statement. That may be exactly the gentle nudge both sides prefer as they test the waters of reconciliation.","Duchess of Sussex posted a short Instagram Story to mark July 17.

The British government announced Thursday plans to lower the voting age for general elections from 18 to 16, making the UK one of the countries with the youngest voting ages worldwide. This change follows the Labour Party’s pledge ahead of last year’s election and is part of a broader package of electoral reforms aimed at modernizing the democratic process amid concerns over low voter turnout.Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized the rationale behind the decision, “I think it’s really important that 16- and 17-year-olds have the vote, because they are old enough to go out to work, they are old enough to pay taxes, so (they) pay in. And I think if you pay in, you should have the opportunity to say what you want your money spent on, which way the government should go.”The government will introduce legislation to parliament to formalize the change, and with its current majority, the bill is expected to pass. However, the move is likely to spark debate, with critics arguing it may benefit Labour, as younger voters are perceived to lean more center-left.Currently, only a handful of countries, including Austria, Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Cuba, allow 16-year-olds to vote in national elections. The UK’s decision aligns the general election voting age with existing regional elections in Scotland and Wales, where 16-year-olds already have the franchise.Additional reforms include automated voter registration, already used in countries like Australia and Canada, and acceptance of UK-issued bank cards as valid identification at polling stations. These changes come after the previous Conservative government’s introduction of mandatory photo ID, which the Electoral Commission said may have prevented about 750,000 people from voting in the last election.Harry Quilter-Pinner, executive director of the Institute for Public Policy Research, described the reforms as “the biggest reform to our electoral system since 1969,” when the voting age was first lowered to 18. He estimated that the combined changes could add 9.5 million voters to the rolls, addressing the current crisis of declining democratic engagement.“Our democracy is in crisis, and we risk reaching a tipping point where politics loses its legitimacy,” Quilter-Pinner warned, supporting the government’s plans.",The UK government announced Thursday plans to lower the voting age for general elections from 18 to 16.

UK's first 3-parent IVF births: 8 healthy babies born; breakthrough in genetic medicine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uks-first-3-parent-ivf-births-8-healthy-babies-born-breakthrough-in-genetic-medicine/articleshow/122632657.cms,"AI- Representative Image





Doctors in the UK have confirmed the birth of eight healthy babies conceived using DNA from three individuals through an IVF technique designed to prevent inherited mitochondrial disorders.The procedure, known as mitochondrial donation treatment (MDT), combines the DNA of the biological mother and father with healthy mitochondrial DNA from a female donor. It is designed to replace faulty mitochondria—the energy-producing structures in cells—with healthy ones from a donor, thereby stopping the transmission of potentially fatal genetic conditions.According to Sky News, this advancement ""takes medicine into uncharted territory."" The technique was developed to prevent inherited mitochondrial disorders, which affect around 1 in 5, 000 babies and can cause serious issues such as brain damage, muscle failure, blindness, or death.All eight babies born through this technique in the UK are reported to be healthy. The human fertilisation and embryology authority (HFEA), which regulates fertility treatments in the UK, had previously approved the use of MDT on a case-by-case basis.The Guardian quoted scientists saying, ""This is not about creating designer babies. It's a way to prevent devastating illnesses."" They also noted that long-term follow-up is still required to fully assess the safety and effectiveness of the method.Meanwhile, NPR highlighted that the first baby born using this approach was in Mexico in 2016. The UK is the first country to officially legalise the technique under regulatory supervision.While promising, experts remain cautious. “There’s still much to learn,” one researcher told NPR, adding that ""monitoring these children over time is essential."""," mitochondrial donation treatment (MDT) combines DNA of biological mother and father with healthy mitochondrial DNA from a female donor.

LONDON: Pilots should be filmed in the cockpit so that accidents can be investigated properly, International Air Transport Association (IATA) director-general Willie Walsh has said.“I can see there is a strong argument now for the inclusion of video in the cockpit to assist in accident investigations,” Walsh said in his first remarks since the release of the preliminary investigation report on the June 12 Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner crash.“We believe that any major incident or accident that takes place needs to be investigated fully and properly and reported so that everyone can benefit. Based on what little we know now, it is quite possible that a video recording in addition to the voice recording, would significantly assist the investigators conducting [the Air India] investigation,” Walsh, former chief executive of British Airways, said in Singapore on Wednesday.“Videos are becoming important now as there have been so many crashes over the past few years,” a retired Boeing pilot captain who flew 737s internationally told TOI. “A video recording would answer all the questions about the Air India crash… People need answers.”Pilots' unions are worried about privacy breaches and the videos being misused. President of the largest airline pilot union in the world, the Air Line Pilots Association, Int’l (ALPA), Capt Jason Ambrosi, told TOI: “ALPA has long recommended that any additional resources should be focused on enhancing current safety systems to record more data of a higher quality and improve pilot situational awareness by deploying readily available technology, like ADS-B in equipage, to prevent accidents, as opposed to video images, which are subject to misinterpretation and may lead investigators away from accurate conclusions.Flight deck image recorders will not improve safety and could impede it by diverting limited resources that could be used for more valuable safety enhancements. ALPA remains equally concerned as to how such proposed video recordings may be misused.”In 2000, US National Transportation Safety Board chairman Jim Hall had urged the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to require all commercial US airliners to be equipped with cockpit video recorders.An FAA spokesperson told TOI, “The FAA formed an Aviation Rulemaking Committee in Sept 2023 to provide suggestions for addressing these recommendations.

LONDON: Britain set up a secret scheme to relocate thousands of Afghans to the UK after a soldier accidentally disclosed the personal details of more than 33,000 people, putting them at risk of reprisals from the Taliban, court documents showed on Tuesday.A judge at London’s high court said in a May 2024 judgment first made public Tuesday that about 20,000 people may have to be offered relocation to Britain, a move that would likely cost “several billion pounds”.Britain’s current defence minister John Healey said that around 4,500 affected people “are in Britain or in transit ... at a cost of around 400 million pounds”.The government is also facing lawsuits from those affected by the breach. A ministry of defence-commissioned review of the breach, a summary of which was also published Tuesday, said more than 16,000 affected people had been relocated to the UK as of May this year.The government was forced to act after the breach revealed the names of Afghans who had helped British forces in Afghanistan before they withdrew from the country in chaotic circumstances in 2021. The details emerged on Tuesday after a legal ruling known as a superinjunction was lifted.The injunction had been granted in 2023 after the MoD argued a public disclosure of the breach could put people at risk of extra-judicial killing or serious violence by the Taliban.The dataset contained personal information of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied to be relocated to Britain and their families. It was released in error in early 2022, before the MoD spotted the breach in Aug 2023, when part of the dataset was published on Facebook.The former Conservative government obtained the injunction the following month.REUTERS","Britain set up a secret scheme to relocate thousands of Afghans to the UK.

It was the top lot in the Travel and Exploration online sale and the first time this portrait has been sold at auction.According to the artist’s family, the portrait was on public display in 1974 when it was allegedly attacked with a knife by a Hindu right-wing activist. The catalogue entry refers to signs of restoration to tears in several places.Leighton met Gandhi when he visited London in 1931 to attend the Second Round Table Conference.At the time, Leighton was in a relationship with political journalist Henry Noel Brailsford, who was a passionate supporter of Indian Independence. It was through this connection that she was introduced to Gandhi and was one of the few artists admitted to Gandhi’s office to sit with him to sketch and paint him.In November 1931, Leighton showcased her portraits in an exhibition at the Albany Galleries in London.Journalist Winifred Holtby attended the opening and wrote: “The little man squats bare-headed, in his blanket, one finger raised, as it often is to emphasise a point, his lips parted for a word that is almost a smile… the statesman who knows just how to play on the psychology of friends and enemies alike.”","“Portrait of Mahatma Gandhi’ by British artist Clare Leighton sold for triple its estimate of £50,000-£70,000 (Rs 57 lakh to Rs 80 lakh) It was the top lot in the Travel and Exploration online sale and the first time this portrait has been sold at auction.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122542027,imgsize-22548,width-400,resizemode-4/122542027.jpg"
